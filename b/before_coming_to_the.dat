5|$|From Exit 4, {{the turnpike}} {{continues}} on a due north course, crossing Slate Creek, <b>before</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Southern Terminal barrier toll plaza, where tickets are issued for all northbound traffic and fares are collected from southbound traffic. The next interchange {{north of the}} toll plaza is Exit 19 (Wellington), serving US-160, which heads west to Wellington, the county seat of Sumner County, and east to Winfield, the seat of adjoining Cowley County. It {{is the first of}} many trumpet interchanges, serving the surface road via a connector road with a toll plaza. When the turnpike first opened, the US-160 interchange was a reversed diamond with four loop ramps, so that all traffic using the interchange had to pass under the bridge and thus through the toll plaza. The new configuration was built c. 1988.|$|E

5|$|The {{appearances}} of the Turk were profitable for Mälzel, {{and he continued}} by taking it and his other machines to the United States. In 1826, he opened an exhibition in New York City that slowly grew in popularity, giving rise to many newspaper stories and anonymous threats of exposure of the secret. Mälzel's problem was finding a proper director for the machine, having trained an unknown woman in France <b>before</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States. He ended up recalling a former director, William Schlumberger, from Alsace in Europe to come to America and work for him again once Mälzel was able to provide the money for Schlumberger's transport.|$|E
5|$|A short {{distance}} later, the two routes enter Manchester Township in Ocean County and continue east through a tract of the Brendan T. Byrne State Forest within the Pine Barrens {{as well as}} a corner of the Fort Dix Military Reservation. The road eventually reaches the community of Whiting, where it passes commercial development at the intersection with CR 539. Here, CR 530 turns south to follow CR 539 and Route 70 continues northeast back into the Pine Barrens. The road turns more to the north-northeast before heading east into Lakehurst to the south of the Lakehurst Naval Air Station. In Lakehurst, Route 70 comes to a traffic circle with CR 4 and CR 12 before running through residential and commercial areas of the town. It intersects with the southern terminus of CR 547, where it widens into a four-lane divided highway. From here, the route crosses over Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Southern Secondary railroad line <b>before</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lakehurst Circle, where it intersects the western terminus of Route 37.|$|E
5|$|At Wardour Street {{station a}} branch {{was to leave}} the main route and head south-east, to connect to the DR's deep-level line east of its station at Charing Cross. Wardour Street station was planned to have {{platforms}} on both branches. The south-west extension to Walham Green was retained with minor alterations. The new route was to branch from the original route east of Brompton Road station, which was to have platforms on both routes. Stations were planned along Fulham Road at its junctions with College Street (now Elystan Street), Neville Street, Drayton Gardens, Redcliffe Gardens, Stamford Bridge and Maxwell Road. The route would interchange with the DR at Walham Green <b>before</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface and running parallel with the DR as far as Parsons Green, beyond which the line was to connect to the DR. The requests for an extension of time and for the powers to build the DR deep-level line from South Kensington to Earl's Court were re-presented. As the B and the GN were now in common ownership, the bill also sought powers to enable the companies to merge and for the B to change its name.|$|E

5|$|Harvey's 1950–51 {{season was}} {{similarly}} unproductive, with the Test players back in Australia {{for a home}} series against England. He was only selected for the two first class matches against Tasmania, was even less successful. In the first match, he made a duck in the first innings, <b>before</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crease {{at the end of}} the run-chase and being yet to score as a nine wicket win was completed. In the next match he made 0 and 9, as Victoria scraped home for a nine run win, despite Harvey conceding 20 runs from four wicketless overs. He ended the first class season with 9 runs at 3.00. In a Second XI fixture against New South Wales, he made 61 before being bowled by Alan Davidson. In the first innings he delivered one over and was attacked heavily, conceding 23 runs. In the second innings, he bowled 13 overs and took 1/49 as New South Wales ended 24 runs short of making Victoria bat again with three wickets in hand when the match ended in a draw.|$|E
5|$|Past US 1, I-476 {{continues}} through wooded suburban areas and interchanges with Pennsylvania Route 3 in Broomall, where it widens to six lanes. The route continues to Radnor Township, on the Main Line, where it interchanges with U.S. Route 30. Stone monuments, including a large stone cairn atop {{a hill and}} a large crushed-stone image of a mythological griffin on a hillside, were constructed at the Route 30 interchange to commemorate Radnor's history {{as part of the}} Welsh Tract. Proceeding northward, the route enters Montgomery County and comes to an interchange with Interstate 76 (Schuylkill Expressway) at West Conshohocken. After crossing the Schuylkill River on the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge, the freeway heads into Plymouth Township, where it interchanges with Ridge Pike and Germantown Pike <b>before</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mid-County Interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Plymouth Meeting. The entire length of the Blue Route is designated the Blue Route Scenic Byway, a Pennsylvania Scenic Byway.|$|E
5|$|The {{last big}} match {{of the season}} was a one-off at Lord's between England and Dominions, a {{combined}} team of players from the British Commonwealth. Miller managed 26 in the Dominions' first innings of 307, <b>before</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crease at 2/60 in the second innings with England still leading by 80 runs. Miller settled in quickly, hitting his second ball through the covers for four and moved to 49 in 49 minutes. He brought up his half-century by lifting Hollies straight back into the crowd. Three balls later, he hit another ball to the same point. At stumps, he was 61 not out with Dominions at 3/145. The next morning, his partner Martin Donnelly was dismissed and replaced by Dominions captain Learie Constantine. Miller then began his attack, hitting the dual leg spin pairing of Hollies and Wright to {{all parts of the}} ground. At one point, all the fielders except for the wicketkeeper and the bowler were on the fence.|$|E

5|$|Through Preston Park, Route370 intersects {{with an old}} {{alignment}} of itself twice <b>before</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main intersection in town, the northern terminus of Route247 (Creamton Drive) and its continuation Rabbit Run Road. The road turns northeastward and passes several residences before intersecting with Shehawken Road, where the road becomes mainly wooded once again. The route parallels an {{alignment of}} former State Route570 and the former Ontario and Western Railroad into Buckingham Township, where the route enters the hamlet of Starlight. In Starlight, Route370 passes the former Ontario and Western station and turns eastward once the old alignment of Route570 merges in. After passing a pond, the highway leaves Starlight and continues northeastward in dense forestry. A short while later, the route turns northward and weaves to an intersection with Route191 (the Hancock Highway) in Buckingham Township. This serves as the northern terminus of Route370.|$|E
5|$|US 46 {{begins at}} a large {{interchange}} with I-80 and Route 94 near the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge leading to Pennsylvania Route 611 {{in the community of}} Columbia in Knowlton Township, Warren County. From this interchange, the route heads southeast along the east bank of the Delaware River as a four-lane divided highway briefly before narrowing into a two-lane undivided road. The road passes through wooded mountainous areas before reaching the community of Delaware. In Delaware, US 46 intersects Route 163, the approach to the former Delaware Bridge, before passing a few commercial establishments. From here, the route continues alongside the river, passing more rural areas of woods and farms with occasional development as it enters White Township. US 46 makes a sharp turn to the east away from the Delaware River, widening into a four-lane divided highway again as it bypasses the town of Belvidere and has a few businesses on it. The road turns back into a two-lane undivided road and comes to a crossroads with CR 519. Past this intersection, US 46 continues through rural sectors with some business <b>before</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northern terminus of Route 31.|$|E
5|$|With the {{extension}} to Paddington still under construction, the LER published {{a bill in}} November 1911 for the continuation to Queen's Park. The extension was to continue north from Paddington, running past Little Venice to Maida Vale before curving north-west to Kilburn and then west to parallel the LNWR main line, <b>before</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface a short distance {{to the east of}} Queen's Park station. Three intermediate stations were to be provided: on Warwick Avenue at the junction with Warrington Avenue, Clifton Villas and Clifton Gardens; at the junction of Elgin and Randolph Avenues (named Maida Vale); and on Cambridge Avenue (named Kilburn Park). The LNWR gave a £1 million loan to the LER at 4% interest in perpetuity to help finance {{the extension}}.

5|$|At {{this stage}} Johnston {{was at the}} peak of his career in terms of bowling average and wickets taken per match. In his 24 Tests to the end of the series, he had taken 111 wickets at 19.22, with Australia winning 19 and losing two. In the Fourth Test in Melbourne, Johnston took match figures of 5/110, {{removing}} Weekes in both innings, <b>before</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crease in the second innings to partner Doug Ring. Australia were 9/222 in pursuit of 260 for victory, with the series finely poised 2–1. The crowd of 30,000 and the constabulary were resigned to an Australian defeat, with the police officers moving into position to stop the customary pitch invasion at the end of the match. However, the Richmond teammates had other ideas and put together a last wicket partnership of 38, which sealed an Australian victory by one wicket. Ring thought that playing for a draw was impractical, so he decided to attack, while Johnston attempted to hold up his end with a series of defensive shots. The West Indian captain John Goddard placed his fielders halfway to the boundary, allowing Johnston to easily take singles, while Ring was able to clear the infield easily. The Richmond pair thought that Goddard's captaincy was poor. Johnston eventually brought up the winning run by turning Frank Worrell for a single behind square leg, 35 minutes after he came to the crease.|$|E
5|$|From here, {{the road}} {{continues}} southwesterly and passes {{to the west}} of Jones Run Parking, where a trail leads to Jones Run Falls, before heading east of Blackrock Summit Parking. Skyline Drive winds south past Blackrock and turns to the west. The roadway heads north before a hairpin turn to the south at Blackrock Gap, where it closely follows the border between Augusta and Albemarle counties. Further south, Skyline Drive passes the Wildcat Ridge Parking Area <b>before</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Crimora Lake Overlook that faces to the west.

5|$|US 46 {{continues}} southeast as a four-lane freeway, {{with the}} US1-9 ramps following the route {{a short distance}} before merging into the route. At this point, US1-9 become concurrent with US 46 and the freeway makes a sharp turn to the north-northeast. The road has an interchange to the 5th Street and 6th Street frontage roads, which parallel the freeway through residential areas and provide access to CR 501. US1-9/ US46 continue into Fort Lee, where it has access to a couple commercial areas via RIRO before encountering the northern terminus of Route 63 at a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. From here, the highway becomes a surface road that continues past more businesses and homes with RIRO access, angling northeast as it comes to an exit for Main Street. Immediately past this point, the road turns east and encounters a complex interchange with I-95, the eastern terminus of Route 4, and the southern terminus of US 9W. Here, US1-9/ US46 all join I-95 (although US46 is unsigned east of this interchange) and continue to the southeast along a multilane freeway with local-express lane configuration consisting of four local lanes and four express lanes in each direction, passing numerous high-rise buildings. The road has an interchange with Route 67 at GWB Plaza <b>before</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eastbound toll plaza for the George Washington Bridge. Past the toll plaza, there is an interchange for the Palisades Interstate Parkway. After the Palisades Interstate Parkway, the road crosses the Hudson River on the George Washington Bridge, which has eight lanes total on the upper deck (formed from the express lanes) and six lanes total on the lower deck (formed from the local lanes). At the New Jersey/New York border on the bridge, US46 ends while I-95 and US1-9 continue into the borough of Manhattan in New York City on the Trans-Manhattan Expressway.|$|E
