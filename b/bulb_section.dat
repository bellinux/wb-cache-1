40|$|Fatigue crack {{propagation}} behavior in bulb stiffeners, which {{are widely used}} in ship structures, is indispensable information for ship structures' fatigue life prediction. This paper aims to provide reasonable simulation process for the fatigue cracks propagated in bulb stiffeners based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) and eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) by using FRANC 3 D and ABAQUS respectively. In order to evaluate the simulations, {{the shape of a}} three dimensional surface crack in full-scale bulb stiffener was measured and estimated through a full-scale fatigue test on a typical ship structure detail. According to the comparisons of the {{crack propagation}} path between the experiment and simulation results, the simulation results were verified to be reasonable and acceptable. Moreover, through analyzing the crack propagation behavior in <b>bulb</b> <b>section,</b> the fatigue failure criterion of bulb stiffeners was investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{cylindrical}} shell combustor with T-bar supports in the 8 -foot HTST at the NASA-Langley Research Center encountered vibratory fatigue cracking {{over a period}} of 50 - 250 tunnel tests within a limited range of the required operating envelope. A preliminary design study provided several suitable thermal protection system designs for the combustor, one of which was a two-pass regenerative type air-cooled omega-shaped segment liner. A final design layout of the omega segment liner was prepared and analyzed for steady-state and transient conditions. The design of a support system for the fuel spray bar assembly was also included. Detail drawings suitable for fabrication purposes were also prepared. Liner design problems defined during the preliminary study included (1) the ingress of gas into the attachment <b>bulb</b> <b>section</b> of the omega segment, (2) the large thermal gradient along the leg of the omega bulb attachment section and, (3) the local peak metal temperature at the radius between the liner ID and the leg of the bulb attachment. These were resolved during the final design task. Analyses of the final design of the omega segment liner indicated that all design goals were met and the design provided the capability of operating over the required test envelope with a life expectancy substantially above the goal of 1500 cycles...|$|E
40|$|Calmodulin, calbindin-D 28 k and calretinin are calcium-binding {{proteins}} largely {{distributed in}} the bipolar olfactory receptor cells. In the olfactory epithelium their distribution seemed to be random. Using immunohistochemistry we have examined their localization in rat olfactory axons extending to the olfactory <b>bulb.</b> <b>Sections</b> were analyzed both horizontally and vertically. Almost all fibers were immunoreactive {{for one of the}} three intracellular calcium-binding proteins whose distribution was not random among the bundles. Three different subclasses of fibers could be detected: calbindin-D 28 k and calretinin immunoreactivities were restricted to external fibers whereas calmodulin immunoreactivity was intense, abundant and largely distributed throughout the internal portion of the olfactory nerve. This additional degree of organization detected in the olfactory axons might play a role in odor discrimination. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{the adult}} {{olfactory}} nerve pathway of rodents, each primary olfactory axon forms a terminal arbor {{in a single}} glomerulus in the olfactory bulb. During development, axons are believed to project directly to and terminate precisely within a glomerulus without any exuberant growth or mistargeting. To gain insight into mechanisms underlying this process, the trajectories of primary olfactory axons during glomerular formation were studied in the neonatal period. Histochemical staining of mouse olfactory <b>bulb</b> <b>sections</b> with the lectin Dolichos biflorus-agglutinin revealed that many olfactory axons overshoot the glomerular layer and course into the deeper laminae of the bulb in the early postnatal period. Single primary olfactory axons were anterogradely labelled either with the lipophilic carbocyanine dye, 1, 12 ̆ 7 -dioctodecyl- 3, 3, 32 ̆ 7, 32 ̆ 7 -tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI), or with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) by localized microinjections into the nerve fiber layer of the rat olfactory bulb. Five distinct trajectories of primary olfactory axons were observed in DLI-labelled preparations at postnatal day 1. 5 (P 1. 5). Axons either coursed directly to and terminated specifically within a glomerulus, branched before terminating in a glomerulus, bypassed glomeruli and entered the underlying external plexiform layer, passed through the glomerular layer with side branches into glomeruli, or branched into more than one glomerulus. HRP-labelled axon arbors from eight postnatal ages were reconstructed by camera lucida and {{were used to determine}} arbor length, arbor area, and arbor branch number. Whereas primary olfactory axons display errors in laminar targeting in the mammalian olfactory bulb, axon arbors typically achieve their adult morphology without exuberant growth. Many olfactory axons appear not to recognize appropriate cues to terminate within the glomerular layer during the early postnatal period. However, primary olfactory axons exhibit precise targeting in the glomerular layer after P 5. 5, indicating temporal differences in either the presence of guidance cues or the ability of axons to respond to these cues.

40|$|Brain {{connectivity}} spans over broad spatial scales, from nanometers to centimeters. In {{order to}} understand the brain at multi-scale, the neural network in wide-field has been visualized in detail by taking advantage of light microscopy. However, the process of staining or addition of fluorescent tags is commonly required, and the image contrast is insufficient for delineation of cytoarchitecture. To overcome this barrier, we use spatial light interference microscopy to investigate brain structure with high-resolution, sub-nanometer pathlength sensitivity without the use of exogenous contrast agents. Combining wide-field imaging and a mosaic algorithm developed in-house, we show the detailed architecture of cells and myelin, within coronal olfactory <b>bulb</b> and cortical <b>sections,</b> and from sagittal sections of the hippocampus and cerebellum. Our technique is well suited to identify laminar characteristics of fiber tract orientation within white matter, e. g. the corpus callosum. To further improve the macro-scale contrast of anatomical structures, and to better differentiate axons and dendrites from cell bodies, we mapped the tissue in terms of its scattering property. Based on our results, we anticipate that spatial light interference microscopy can potentially provide multiscale and multicontrast perspectives of gross and microscopic brain anatomy. ope...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, massive {{parallel}} sequencing has {{revolutionized the}} field of biology and has provided us with {{a vast number of}} new discoveries in fields such as neurology, developmental biology and cancer research. A significant area is deciphering gene expression patterns, as well as other aspects of transcriptome information, such as the impact of splice variants and mutations on biological functions and disease development. By applying RNA-sequencing, one can extract this type of information in a large-scale manner. The most recent approaches include high-resolution techniques such as single cell sequencing and in situ methods in order to circumvent the problems with gene expression averaging in homogenized samples, and loss of spatial information. The research in this thesis is focused on the development of a novel genome-wide spatial transcriptomics method. The technique is used for analysis of intact tissue sections as well as single cells from solution, with the aim to combine gene expression and morphological information. In Paper I, the method is described in detail, and it is shown that the method is able to generate spatial high quality data from mouse olfactory <b>bulb</b> tissue <b>sections</b> (a part of the forebrain) as well as from tissue sections from breast cancer samples. In Paper III, we adapt the library preparation method {{in order to be able}} to execute it on a robotic workstation, thus increasing the reproducibility and the throughput, and decreasing the hands-on time. In Paper IV, we generate 3 D-data from breast cancer samples by serial sectioning. We show that the gene expression can be highly variable along all three axes of a tumor, and we track pathways with specific spatial activity, as well as perform subtype classification with three-dimensional resolution. In Paper II, we present a high-throughput method for single cell transcriptomics of cells in solution. The method is based on the same type of solid surface capture as the tissue protocol described in Papers I, III and IV. Again, we show that we can generate high-quality gene expression data, and connect this to morphological characteristics of the analyzed single cells; both using cultured cells and samples from patients with leukemia.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} how accurately the distribution factor method estimates the live load deflections under the principles of the 2012 AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications (AASHTO LRFD specifications) compared to the results of the NISA finite element analysis software. The simple span bridge model analyzed is developed very similarly to the design example of the PCI Bridge Design Manual. The main difference is a shorter span length and smaller AASHTO-PCI <b>bulb</b> tee <b>sections.</b> 	Three main finite element models are created to estimate the live load deflections under the recommended live load conditions as per AASHTO LRFD specifications. The first model is simulated with simple support conditions. The {{purpose of this}} model is two-fold: compare the deflections to the distribution factor method and to the deflections of the second model that is simulated with elastomeric steel reinforced bearing pads. Thus, the stiffnesses of the elastomeric bearing pads of the second model are varied within the AASHTO LRFD specifications acceptable limits and under low temperature conditions the stiffness is increased accordingly for two cases. The purpose is to investigate if the stiffness have any significant affect on the deflections of the girders. Then a third model is created to investigate if the removal of the intermediate diaphragms have any affect on the deflections. 	The results of the first and second models, including the models with the allowed varied stiffnesses of the bearing pads, found only the interior girders deflecting up to 4 % more and the exterior girders were deflecting up to 5. 55 % less than the estimates of the distribution factor method. In the case when the diaphragms are removed, the deflections of the inner most interior girders are deflecting up to 10. 85 % more compared to the same girders of the model which includes the intermediate diaphragms and the bearing pads. In the unique case of the second model where the bearing pads may stiffen significantly under low temperatures, the girders are deflecting up to 23 % less than when at room temperature conditions. All these findings and other summarized results are discussed in greater detail in this study...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To prepare powder {{formulations}} for brain {{targeting of}} an antiischemic agent by nasal administration. Methods. The microparticles {{have been obtained}} by spray-drying {{in the presence of}} mannitol and lecithin, or chitosan as carriers. The drug content was detected by UV-spectrophotometric analysis; morphology by scanning electronic spectroscopy and particle size by laser diffraction. In vitro drug release studies from microspheres were achieved according to USP 24. Ex vivo mucoadhesive tests were performed on sheep nasal mucosa blowing an air stream over the microsppheres spread onto the mucosa and calculating the detection of drug content by HPLC, upon dissolution in water. The permeability of both free and microencapsulated drug was studied onto sheep nasal mucosa using phosphate buffer (pH 6. 5) as receptor solution and measuring drug concentrations by HPLC. Male Wistar rats received an intravenous infusion of drug. Its nasal administration was also performed using insufflators Monopowder P® (Valois Dispray, France). After the administrations, blood and liquor samples, the olfactory <b>bulb</b> and ventricular <b>sections</b> of the brain were withdrawn and the related drug amounts analysed by HPLC. Results. The drug influenced the size and morphology of microparticles. The dissolution rate of drug decreased after loading in chitosan microparticles. About 60 % of these microspheres was recovered after mucoadhesive tests. The permeation rate of free drug was higher than the encapsulated drug in chitosan microspheres. The drug was not found in the central nervous system (CNS) after intravenous administration, which allowed to obtain blood concentrations in the micromolar range. After nasal administration of the same dose, the drug was found in the CNS (micromolar range in the liquor), but not in the blood. Conclusion.

The powders have been obtained by spray-drying in the presence either of mannitol and lecithin, or chitosan as carriers. The drug content was detected by UV-spectrophotometric analysis, morphology by scanning electronic spectroscopy and particle size by laser diffraction. In vitro drug release studies from microspheres were carried out according to USP 24. Ex vivo mucoadhesive tests were performed on sheep nasal mucosa blowing an air stream over the microspheres spread onto the mucosa and calculating the detection of drug content by HPLC, upon dissolution in water of microparticles still adhered onto the mucosa. The permeability of both free and microencapsulated drug was studied across sheep nasal mucosa using phosphate buffer (pH 6. 5) as receptor solution. Male Wistar rats received an intravenous infusion of drug. Nasal administration was also performed using insufflators Monopowder P® (Valois Dispray, France). After the administration, blood and liquor samples, as well as the olfactory <b>bulb</b> and ventricular <b>sections</b> of the brain were withdrawn and the respective drug amounts analysed by HPLC. According to our results, the drug influenced the particle size and morphology in comparison with blank microparticles. The drug dissolution rate increased or decreased after loading in mannitol or chitosan microparticles, respectively. About 60 % of chitosan microspheres was recovered from mucoadhesive tests. The permeation rate of free drug was lower or higher than that of the encapsulated drug in mannitol or chitosan microspheres, respectively. The drug was not found in the central nervous system (CNS) after intravenous administration, which led to blood concentrations in the micromolar range. However, after nasal administration of the same dose, the drug was found in the CNS (up to micromolar range in the liquor, up to 0. 2 ng/mg tissue in the brain sections). The CPA amounts detected in rat blood after nasal administration of the powders appeared negligible with respect to the amounts detected after intravenous administration. We can conclude that nasal administration of microparticles prepared by spray-drying appears a promising strategy to obtain the selective CNS targeting of antiischemic adenosine derivatives...|$|R
40|$|Authors: Geoffrey Norris, Noel Derecki & Jonathan Kipnis ### Abstract This is an {{effective}} tool to measure the process complexity of microglia in order to detect subtle changes in microglia morphology. Confocal Z-projections using a single antibody on fixed tissue {{can be used to}} detail microglia profiles in comparison to various conditions including brain region, disease models, and aging. ### Introduction This profiling technique can be used to compare microglial morphology in response to injury, age, genetic background, or for regional comparisons. Sholl profiles detailing process length, complexity, and soma size may be obtained by following this procedure. ### Materials 1. 4 % PFA fixed floating brain sections - 0. 5 % Triton in PBS - PBS (0. 1 M) - Normal chicken serum (Vector Labs) - Bovine serum albumin - Aquamount - Polyclonal Rabbit anti-Mouse Iba 1 antibody (Biocare Medical) - Alexa Fluor® 647 Chicken anti-Rabbit IgG (Life Technologies) - DAPI nuclear stain (Sigma) ### Equipment 1. Confocal microscope (Leica SP 8 used in all of our studies) - FIJI software (Variant of ImageJ) ### Procedure 1. Sacrifice an animal with an i. p. injection of a lethal dose of ketamine. - Transcardially perfuse the mouse on a low speed (~ 3 minutes) with 15 mL of ice-cold 0. 1 M PBS containing 5 U/mL heparin. (the right atrium is clipped with scissors shortly after perfusion to ensure effective clearing of the brain). - Next infuse 25 mL of ice cold 4 % PFA. - Remove the brain and store in 4 % PFA at 4 degrees C for 72 hours of post-fixation with gentle rocking in 20 mL scintillation vials. - Remove excess PFA by dabbing the brain on a kimwipe and then transfer to a scintillation vial containing a 30 % sucrose solution at 4 degrees. - Once the brain has fully sunk (~ 2 days) the brain can be snap frozen in isopentane on dry ice or mounted immediately for freezing on chucks for slicing. - Mount the brain on a cryostat chuck using the cut bulb of a transfer pipette and OCT. - Place the empty cylinder of the transfer pipette bulb on to the chuck pre-stored in the cryostat Quick Freeze bar. - Place a layer of OCT on the chuck and orient the frozen or fresh brain flush with the <b>bulb</b> for coronal <b>sectioning.</b> - Place 40 um coronal sections in 0. 1 % sodium azide in PBS for storage at 4 degrees C. - Briefly wash slices in PBS to remove sodium azide. - Wash in 0. 5 % PBST (Triton X- 100) for 15 minutes at room temperature for permeabilization. - Wash in two rinses of PBS for 5 minutes at room temperature. - Block for 2 hours at room temperature in 5 % normal chicken serum. - Incubate in primary antibody (Biocare Medical polyclonal rabbit-anti mouse Iba 1) at 1 : 300 in 0. 5 % BSA in PBS overnight at 4 degrees C. - Wash 3 x for 5 minutes in PBS at room temperature - Place in secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor® 647 Chicken Anti-Rabbit IgG) diluted 1 : 800 in 5 % normal chicken serum in PBS for 2 hours at room temperature. - Wash for 5 minutes in DAPI diluted 1 : 20, 000 in PBS at room temperature. - Wash 2 x for 5 minutes in PBS at room temperature. - Mount on slides using Aquamount and let dry in the dark at room temperature for at least four hours. - Using the 63 x objective on the confocal microscope, utilize the UV wide-field laser and DAPI fluorescence to select three fields from a given slice to represent that brain region. Three fields from each slice with three slices per mouse with at least three mice per experimental condition should be used to ensure a representative sampling of microglia (n > 30 microglia). - Once the focus is set on the eyepieces, switch to the optimal laser for Iba 1 fluorescence and range the z-stack on the microscope so that an entire microglia is located within the z-stack (~ 30 um per stack). - While imaging preferences should be determined by each user, our lab prefers to use HyD detectors in counting mode on the SP 8 Leica confocal microscope. This combined with a 3 -frame average provides the best resolution for obtaining clear Z-stacks. - Capture each Z-stack at a minimum resolution of 512 × 512, and enable your stack to make one slice per micron. - Load images on to FIJI using the drag and drop method. - Prepare a maximum intensity Z-stack projection - Make the image binary by thresholding to include microglial processes. - Isolate a single microglia by removing surrounding processes with the eraser tool. - Using the line segment tool, draw a single line {{from the center of the}} microglia soma to its longest process. - Using the Sholl analysis plugin, define the first shell to be 10 um outside of the cell body (to exclude the soma from Sholl analysis) and set each step to be 5 um. Select linear profile to conclude the analysis. - Copy the Sholl profile and enter in to Excel. Two complete microglia per field should be used for analysis. Avoid incomplete microglia or those with processes on the margin of the field. - Processes can then be erased and the microglia soma size recorded. - Once profiles are compiled for each mouse, total profiles for each experimental condition are pooled and imported in to statistical software. A two-way ANOVA should then be performed with the number of intersections from soma center and experimental variable used as the factors. ### Timing - Tissue Collection- ~ 2 hrs - Tissue Fixation and Cryoprotection- ~ 4 days - Tissue processing and immunohistochemistry – user defined - Imaging and quantification- (~ 1 day for a cohort of 6 mice) ### Anticipated Results Properly prepared tissue and a quality microscope should ensure excellent and reproducible microglial imaging with regards to the Iba 1 antibody. CX 3 CR 1 -GFP mice may also be imaged for Sholl Profiling in a similar way. ### References 1. Morrison, H. W., and Filosa, J. A.
