40|$|A two-sample test is studied which {{rejects the}} null {{hypothesis}} of equal population medians when two Wilcoxon distribution free confidence intervals are disjoint. A confidence interval for the difference in population medians is constructed by subtracting the endpoints of two one-sample confidence intervals. Two different ways to select the one-sample intervals are presented. A solution that specifies equal confidence coefficients for the one-sample intervals is recommended.

He also learns how {{to carry out the}} anamnèse (medical history) and the clinical examination of a patient {{at the time of his}} clinical training courses (called “training courses of checklists”, because the clinical examination linear and is structured, with <b>boxes</b> which one <b>notches)</b> associated with teaching with semiology.

60|$|The spindle is {{a slender}} rod of wood which {{passes through the}} end of the box into the interior. About half of the spindle is within the box and half without. There is a small notch in the outer part of the spindle, and another in the end of the box, a short {{distance}} above the spindle. There is a small bar of wood, with both ends sharpened, and made of such a length as just to reach from the notch in the end of the <b>box,</b> to the <b>notch</b> in the spindle. This bar is the apparatus to which the end of the string is fastened, as before described.|$|R

Notches are useful in offering a rough guide to significance of difference of medians; if the <b>notches</b> of two <b>boxes</b> do not overlap, this offers evidence of {{a statistically significant difference}} between the medians. The width of the notches is proportional to the interquartile range (IQR) of the sample and inversely proportional to the square root {{of the size of the}} sample.

40|$|A {{prospective}} {{multiple choice}} question (MCQ) study developed to pre‐ and post‐test fifth year medical {{students at the}} University of Queensland. was undertaken during 1990. We investigated {{whether there was a}} significant gain in their surgical knowledge base resulting from non‐surgical rotations during the same year. We have previously reported a retrospective study suggesting that there was such a gain. Comparable clinical surgical pre‐ and post‐tests were adapted from a fresh question bank, and were presented prospectively to four groups of fifth year medical students {{at the beginning and end}} of each 7 week General Surgical term. In contrast to our retrospective study, we found there was no significant increment in surgical knowledge using non‐parametric <b>Notched</b> <b>Box</b> and Whisker Plot analysis of data. We conclude that this is either because students are compartmentalizing their factual knowledge base between one speciality and the next, or that indeed there is no benefit to Surgical knowledge base from prior non‐surgical rotations. Assuming the former, a combined Medical and Surgical Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) at the end of the fourth year could serve to broaden the student 2 ̆ 7 s horizons and reduce factual dissociation during the fifth year.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{feasibility}} of using acoustic signatures in snore signals for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Methods: Snoring sounds of 30 apneic snorers (24 males; 6 females; apnea-hypopnea index, AHI = 46. 9 ± 25. 7 events/h) and 10 benign snorers (6 males; 4 females; AHI = 4. 6 ± 3. 4 events/h) were captured in a sleep laboratory. The recorded snore signals were preprocessed to remove noise, and subsequently, modeled using a linear predictive coding (LPC) technique. Formant frequencies (F 1, F 2, and F 3) were extracted from the LPC spectrum for analysis. The accuracy of this approach was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves and <b>notched</b> <b>box</b> plots. The relationship between AHI and F 1 was further explored via regression analysis. Results: Quantitative differences in formant frequencies between apneic and benign snores are found in same- or both-gender snorers. Apneic snores exhibit higher formant frequencies than benign snores, especially F 1, which {{can be related to}} the pathology of OSA. This study yields a sensitivity of 88 %, a specificity of 82 %, and a threshold value of F 1 = 470 Hz that best differentiate apneic snorers from benign snorers (both gender combined). Conclusion: Acoustic signatures in snore signals carry information for OSA diagnosis, and snore-based analysis might potentially be a non-invasive and inexpensive diagnostic approach for mass screening of OSA...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a quantitative protocol of proton {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (1 H NMR) that allows the determination of human amniotic fluid metabolite concentrations, which are then used in a metabonomic study to establish patient health during gestation. 1 H NMR free inductive decays (FIDs) of 258 human amniotic fluid samples from a 500 MHz spectrometer are acquired. Quantitative analyses methods in both the frequency- and time-domain are carried out and compared. Frequency-domain analysis is accomplished by integration of the metabolite peaks {{before and after the}} inclusion of a known standard addition of alanine. Time-domain analysis is accomplished by the direct exponential curve resolution algorithm (DECRA). Both techniques are assessed by applications to calibration biological solutions and a simulated data set. The DECRA method proves to be a more accurate and precise route for quantitative analysis, and is included in the developed protocol. Well-defined peaks of various components are visible in the frequency-domain 1 H NMR spectra, including lactate, alanine, acetate, citrate, choline, glycine, and glucose. All are quantified with the proposed protocol. Statistical t-test and <b>notched</b> <b>box</b> and whisker plots are used to compare means of metabolite concentrations for diabetic and normal patients. Glucose, glycine, and choline are all found to correlate with gestational diabetes mellitus early in gestation. With further development, time-domain quantitative 1 H NMR has potential to become a robust diagnostic tool for gestational health...|$|R
40|$|The 1993 Working Group on the Assessment of Mackerel, Horse Mackerel, Sardine and Anchovy {{agreed to}} carry out a {{mackerel}} otolith exchange programme to salve the problems found in age readings. A total of 398 pairs of otoliths was exchanged, 200 of which came from the western area (ICES Divisions VIa and VIIbc) and 198 were from the southern area (ICES Divisions VIIIc and IXa), and ten readers from different countries took part in the exchange. The camparison of otolith readings of the two areas was carried out separately. The results show an unacceptable variability in mackerel age determination between the readers from different countries. The average general agreement between readers was low in the two areas, 47 % for the western area and 51 % for the southern area. Agreement between readers varies between 19 % and 71 % for the western area and between 4 % and 81 % for the southern area. Standard deviations by age groups increase considerably for age groups > 5 years for the western area sample and for ages > 3 years for the southern area sample. The age bias plots of each reader against the modal age show great variability in the samples from the two areas, above all in older ages. The age bias plots for all readers combined show that bias increases with age, and that older fish tend to be underestimated. The results of Wilcoxon's test to analyze bias between readers shows that bias exists between most readers in both samples. The <b>notched</b> <b>box</b> and whisker plots show differences in the interquartile range, average, median and symmetry in the different results of the readers. Considering the importance of age readings in assessment, new investigations are necessary to increase agreement, and to standardize ageings...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis has been undertaken to develop statistical tools for monitoring adverse events in hospitals that adjust for varying patient risk. The studies involved a detailed literature review of risk adjustment scores for patient mortality following cardiac surgery, comparison of institutional performance, the performance of risk adjusted CUSUM schemes for varying risk profiles of the populations being monitored, the effects of uncertainty in the estimates of expected probabilities of mortality on performance of risk adjusted CUSUM schemes, and the instability of the estimated average run lengths of risk adjusted CUSUM schemes found using the Markov chain approach. The literature review of cardiac surgical risk found {{that the number of}} risk factors in a risk model and its discriminating ability were independent, the risk factors could be classified into their "dimensions of risk", and a risk score could not be generalized to populations remote from its developmental database if accurate predictions of patients' probabilities of mortality were required. The conclusions were that an institution could use an "off the shelf" risk score, provided it was recalibrated, or it could construct a customized risk score with risk factors that provide at least one measure for each dimension of risk. The use of report cards to publish adverse outcomes as a tool for quality improvement has been criticized in the medical literature. An analysis of the report cards for cardiac surgery in New York State showed that the institutions' outcome rates appeared overdispersed compared to the model used to construct confidence intervals, and the uncertainty associated with the estimation of institutions' out come rates could be mitigated with trend analysis. A second analysis of the mortality of patients admitted to coronary care units demonstrated the use of <b>notched</b> <b>box</b> plots, fixed and random effect models, and risk adjusted CUSUM schemes as tools to identify outlying hospitals. An important finding from the literature review was that the primary reason for publication of outcomes is to ensure that health care institutions are accountable for the services they provide. A detailed review of the risk adjusted CUSUM scheme was undertaken and the use of average run lengths (ARLs) to assess the scheme, as the risk profile of the population being monitored changes, was justified. The ARLs for in-control and out-of-control processes were found to increase markedly as the average outcome rate of the patient population decreased towards zero. A modification of the risk adjusted CUSUM scheme, where the step size for in-control to out-of-control outcome probabilities were constrained to no less than 0. 05, was proposed. The ARLs of this "minimum effect" CUSUM scheme were found to be stable. The previous assessment of the risk adjusted CUSUM scheme assumed that the predicted probability of a patient's mortality is known. A study of its performance, where the estimates of the expected probability of patient mortality were uncertain, showed that uncertainty at the patient level did not affect the performance of the CUSUM schemes, provided that the risk score was well calibrated. Uncertainty in the calibration of the risk model appeared to cause considerable variation in the ARL performance measures. The ARLs of the risk adjusted CUSUM schemes were approximated using simulation because the approximation method using the Markov chain property of CUSUMs, as proposed by Steiner et al. (2000), gave unstable results. The cause of the instability was the method of computing the Markov chain transition probabilities, where probability is concentrated at the midpoint of its Markov state. If probability was assumed to be uniformly distributed over each Markov state, the ARLs were stabilized, provided that the scores for the patients' risk of adverse outcomes were discrete and finite...|$|R
