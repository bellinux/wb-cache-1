5000|$|A booster cheque is a {{fraudulent}} or <b>bad</b> <b>cheque</b> {{used to make}} {{a payment}} to a credit card account in order to [...] "bust out" [...] or raise the amount of available credit on otherwise-legitimate credit cards. The amount of the cheque is credited to the card account by the bank as soon as the payment is made, even though the cheque has not yet cleared. Before the <b>bad</b> <b>cheque</b> is discovered, the perpetrator goes on a spending spree or obtains cash advances until the newly-"raised" [...] available limit on the card is reached. The original cheque then bounces, but by then it is already too late.|$|E

50|$|Returned check deposit - The {{account holder}} {{deposits}} a cheque or money {{order and the}} deposited item is returned due to non-sufficient funds, a closed account, or being discovered to be counterfeit, stolen, altered, or forged.

This could be due to a deposited item that is known to be bad, or the customer could be a victim of a <b>bad</b> <b>cheque</b> or a counterfeit check scam.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between the misery index and the crime rate and to determine the motivational and opportunity effects of the misery index in Iran from 1971 to 2008. A parsimony model which corrected multicollinearity and specification problems in the standard crime function was proposed. Unrestricted error correction model (UECM) was employed to do bounds test and to examine the presence of cointegration. Multiple-rank F-test was used as well to examine the causality relationship. The results indicated that there had been long-run relationships between the misery index and economic crimes such as embezzlement, bribery, forgery, and drawing <b>bad</b> <b>cheques.</b> The motivational and opportunity effects were also verified by the model. Also, two-causality relationships existed between crimes like willful murder, indecent commitments, embezzlement, bribery, forgery, stealing and the misery index. Furthermore, the results showed uni-directional causality from the misery index to drawing <b>bad</b> <b>cheques.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|Shaik, who was Zuma's {{financial}} advisor at the time, knew that Zuma could never afford {{to repay the}} sum of the loans on his salary. He also knew, since he had access to all of Zuma's financial records, about unpaid home loans, an overdraft of 66,500 Rand (US$10,200) in an account with Nedbank, one of South Africa's largest banks, another debt owed to Wesbank, and more money borrowed but not owed yet to Permanent Bank and Standard Bank. He knew that every month Zuma spent more money than his salary, and that he was writing <b>bad</b> <b>cheques</b> and failing to meet debit card payments. Shaik did not expect to be paid back, however, as he was buying influence with Zuma, which was used to win government contracts for his company, Nkobi Holdings.|$|R
