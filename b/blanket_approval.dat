5000|$|On January 18, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales {{told the}} Senate Judiciary Committee [...] "Court orders issued {{last week by}} a Judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court will enable the {{government}} to conduct electronic surveillance - very specifically, surveillance into {{or out of the}} United States where there is probable cause to believe that one of the communicants is a member or agent of al Qaeda or an associated terrorist organization - subject to the approval of the FISA Court. We believe that the court's orders will allow the necessary speed and agility the government needs to protect our Nation from the terrorist threat." [...] The ruling by the FISA Court {{was the result of a}} two-year effort between the White House and the court to find a way to obtain court approval that also would [...] "allow the necessary speed and agility" [...] to find terrorists, Gonzales said in a letter to the top committee members. The [...] "innovative" [...] court order on Jan 10 will do that, Gonzales wrote. Senior Justice department officials would not say whether the orders provided individual warrants for each wiretap or whether the court had given <b>blanket</b> legal <b>approval</b> for the entire NSA program. The American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement that [...] "without more information about what the secret FISA court has authorized, there is no way to determine whether the NSA's current activities are lawful." [...] Chip Pitts of Stanford Law School argues that substantial legal questions remain regarding the core NSA program as well as the related data mining program (and the use of National Security Letters), despite the government's apparently bringing the NSA program within the purview of the FISA law.|$|R
40|$|A Russian {{solar array}} panel removed in November 1997 from the non-articulating {{photovoltaic}} array on the Mir core module {{was returned to}} Earth on STS- 89 in January 1998. The panel {{had been exposed to}} low Earth orbit (LEO) for 10 years prior to retrieval. The retrieval provided a unique opportunity to study the effects of the LEO environment on a functional solar array. To take advantage of this opportunity, a team composed of members from RSC-Energia (Russia), the Boeing Company, and the following NASA Centers [...] Johnson Space Center, Kennedy Space Center, Langley Research Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, and Lewis Research Center [...] was put together to analyze the array. After post-retrieval inspections at the Spacehab Facility at Kennedy in Florida, the array was shipped to Lewis in Cleveland for electrical performance tests, closeup photodocumentation, and removal of selected solar cells and <b>blanket</b> material. With <b>approval</b> from RSC-Energia, five cell pairs and their accompanying blanket and mesh material, and samples of painted handrail materials were selected for removal {{on the basis of their}} ability to provide degradation information. Sites were selected that provided different sizes and shapes of micrometeoroid impacts and different levels of surface contamination. These materials were then distributed among the team for round robin testing...|$|R
50|$|OIN {{supporters}} {{argue that}} Sherrill stands only {{to say that}} the OIN cannot re-instate its tax immunity, but that the land is Indian Land. UCE and its supporters disagreed; they counter that the Sherrill ruling provided a <b>blanket</b> <b>approval</b> for the jurisdictions to foreclose on all OIN property that owe back taxes. Some UCE members interpreted the ruling as making the OIN casino operation illegal under state law. They speculate that it should be closed until the state and the tribe reach a new agreement on gaming.|$|E

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order 436 (1985) provides <b>blanket</b> <b>approval</b> for pipelines that choose to become common carriers transporting gas intrastate. FERC Order 451 (1986) deregulates the wellhead, and FERC Order 490 (April 1988) authorises producers, pipelines, {{and others to}} terminate gas sales or purchases without seeking prior FERC approval. As {{a result of these}} orders, more than 75% of gas sales are conducted through the spot market, and unprecedented market volatility exists.|$|E

Thomas said: We will get more of what we tolerate. Sexual behavior is an important cultural and moral issue. Mr. Obama won the election with just 52 {{percent of the popular}} vote and a margin of 7 percent over Sen. John McCain. This should not be seen as a mandate for him and his administration to make over America in a secular and liberal image.

50|$|On 1 May 2015, Yukon {{modified}} its Business Corporations Act, in {{an effort}} to attract more benefits and participants to its economy. One amendment to the BCA lets a proxy be given for voting purposes. Another change will allow directors to pursue business opportunities declined by the corporation, a practice off-limits in most other jurisdictions due to the inherent potential for conflicts of interest. One of the changes will allow a corporation to serve as a director of a subsidiary registered in Yukon. The legislation also allows companies to add provisions in their articles of incorporation giving directors <b>blanket</b> <b>approval</b> to sell of all of the company’s assets without requiring a shareholder vote. If provided for by a unanimous shareholders agreement, a corporation is not required to have directors at all. There is increased flexibility regarding the location of corporate records offices, including the ability to maintain a records office outside of the Yukon so long as it is accessible by electronic means.|$|E
5000|$|The Plessy {{decision}} did {{not address}} an earlier Supreme Court case, Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886), [...] involving discrimination against Chinese immigrants, that held that a law that is race-neutral on its face, but is administered in a prejudicial manner, is an infringement of the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution.While in the 20th century, the Supreme Court began to overturn state statutes that disenfranchised African Americans, as in Guinn v. United States (1915), with Plessy, it upheld segregation that Southern states enforced in nearly every other sphere {{of public and private}} life.The Court soon extended Plessy to uphold segregated schools. In Berea College v. Kentucky, , the Court upheld a Kentucky statute that barred Berea College, a private institution, from teaching both black and white students in an integrated setting. Many states, particularly in the South, took Plessy and Berea as <b>blanket</b> <b>approval</b> for restrictive laws, generally known as Jim Crow laws, that created second-class status for African Americans.|$|E
5000|$|A major delay {{occurred}} in getting clearance from Central Railway (CR) {{to construct a}} 50.9-metre bridge over the Central Line. Despite receiving the request in 2007, CR took 5 years and asked for 4 changes in design before finally approving construction in July 2012. The approval came with the rider that MMRDA could only start construction in October 2012, after the monsoon. A railway official defended CR stating, [...] "MMRDA blamed us for the delay. But {{the design of the}} road overbridge across the tracks was such that it would not have got the commissioner of railway safety's approval. The consultants should have thought about this long ago. We had also given <b>blanket</b> <b>approval</b> to launch girders more than a year ago. But the girder-launching work was carried out six months ago as they did not arrive from Punjab at the site, where, too, no preparations were made." [...] The MMRDA also faced challenges launching the 14 girders, each weighing 140 tonne, as they could only carry out work for 3 hours at night to avoid affecting rail traffic. All girders were launched in 21 days. According to Jitendra Gupta of the Citizens' Transport Committee, [...] "There is no accountability and coordination among the government agencies involved. We had met the railway chief engineer in charge of the project around four years ago and were told that he had 200 proposals like the SCLR to examine because of his wide jurisdiction. He said he couldn't make an exception for the SCLR and speed up clearances." ...|$|E
40|$|It is envisaged that {{a single}} body would assign the biobarcodes and {{maintain}} a public database listing the biobarcode sequences of organisms that have been released. It is clearly advantageous to industry, regulators and taxpayers that such a system be instituted because {{of the amount of}} resources saved and the protection provided. Because of the savings, it is in the public interest that such a system be universally instituted. In Canada, for example, the insertion of a biobarcode would probably not come under regulatory scrutiny if biobarcodes are introduced into plants because they are not considered to be ‘plants with novel traits ’ if they are non-protein producing. In Europe, any introduced sequence (except antisense) seems to come under regulatory scrutiny, but after due risk assessment it is hoped that a <b>blanket</b> <b>approval</b> could be obtained for biobarcodes that meet the specific criteria listed above (and possibly others) ...|$|E

Comparative costs are measured {{both in terms of}} internal systems savings and the level of service provided the academic community. LooKING BACK over the past two dec-ades, one can see that three n 1 ajor issues seem to have dominated discussions among academic librarians: (1) The relative merits of the Library of Con-gress Classification System as compared with the Dewey Decimal; (2) the role of the computer in library operations; and (3) <b>blanket</b> <b>approval</b> plans as a means for systematic collection growth. All three have generated considerable amounts of impassioned rhetoric at pro-fessional gatherings and a corpus of polemical writing, but only a relatively small amount of research aimed at eval-uating how the Library of Congress Classification System, the computer, or approval plans have advanced or retard-ed the academic library's progress to-ward its stated educational objectives. Nevertheless, the trend toward the Li-brary of Congress Classification System continues to accelerate, the use and abuse of the computer is increasingly evident, and the number of academi...|$|E
40|$|It is gratifying to {{see that}} the {{spirited}} debate that ensued at the Think Tank remains enlivened in the commentaries. These additional perspectives were supplied by several experts and committed professionals akin to those who participated in the Think Tank. We wish to thank all of the commentators for thoughtful analyses of what did, and did not, happen at the Think Tank. Each commentary provided a frame of reference useful to us, as the Reporters, in reflecting upon what was achieved and what tasks remain. Thirty-two professionals, representing a wide variety of disciplines and expertise, convened to discuss the issues surrounding shared parenting practices and policy. We reached consensus points, as noted in the Final Report and discussed in the commentaries. We also left some of the thorniest issues for subsequent discussion and work, much to the disappointment of some commentators. Reading through the commentaries, we felt a bit of déjà vu. The same divisions that made consensus so elusive at the Think Tank are evident in the nature and breadth of perspectives expressed in the commentaries. To wit: Three of the six commentators (one legal scholar and two mental health scholars) favored statutory presumptions or guidelines regarding shared parental decision making, although they differed as to whether they endorsed a <b>blanket</b> <b>approval</b> or supported a shared decision-making presumption only under particular circumstances. Two legal practitioners writing together espoused no presumption generally, but would consider shared decision making in specific situations. One mental health scholar opposed presumptions but only for some of the family court populace, and the only judge providing commentary strongly advocated judicial discretion and individual decision making. Clearly, diversityin opinion reigned, just as it did at the Think Tank...|$|E
40|$|Installation of a zero-discharge, runoff-control {{system is}} one method for solving {{potential}} water pollution problems from many feedlot operations. Even though the zero-discharge system {{is required by}} regulation in several states, this approach may be economically prohibitive for many small operations. An alternative is to install a vegetative filter system to adequately control the runoff so that violations of water quality standards will not occur during storm runoff. Vegetative filters are systems in which a vegetative area such as pasture, grassed waterways, or even cropland is used for treating feedlot runoff by settling, filtration, dilution, adsorption of pollutants and infiltration. Generally, vegetative filters have either channelized or overland flow. Channelized-flow systems have various configurations such as a graded terrace channel or grassed waterways, but are simply systems in which flow is concentrated in a relatively narrow channel. In overland flow systems flow occurs as sheet flow less than 30 mm (1. 2 in.) deep, with widths ranging from 5 to 6 m (16 or 20 ft) up to possibly 30 m (98 ft). LITERATURE REVIEW Much early use of vegetative filter treatment was for the disposal of canning-industry wastes. Mather (1969) reported removal of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) from cannery wastes of 94 to 99 percent during overland flow in a disposal area, although Bendixen et al. (1969) reported only 66 percent BOD removal. Nitrogen removals of 61 to 94 percent and phosphorus removals of 39 to 81 percent were also reported in these two studies. Sievers et al. (1975) used a grassed waterway filter to treat anaerobic swine lagoon effluent. Willrich and Boda (1976) also treated swine lagoon effluent with sloping grass strips. Open feedlot runoff-treatment systems have been reported by Sutton et al. (1976) and Swanson et al. (1975). While the degree of treatment varied, these studies indicated that vegetative tilters were effective and potentially acceptable treatment alternatives. No uniform criteria evolved from these studies, however, and variable performance has made environmental authorities hesitate to give <b>blanket</b> <b>approval</b> to this concept. Lybecker (1977) showed that vegetative filters are generally more economical than zero-discharge systems, making them an attractive alternative to small feedlots with minimum capital...|$|E
40|$|Our {{indoor games}} editor has {{recovered}} from the avalanche of letters on reading in bed (Bandolier 30) and from the cirticism {{that we did not}} broach the incidence (or circum-stance) of myocardial infarction after sex. As a tabloid we approach these topics with discretion, following in the tradi-tion of the Parisian madame and the cardinal. <b>Blanket</b> <b>approval</b> In 1966 the King’s Fund produced a specification and a pro-totype for what became known as “the King’s Fund bed”. Designers at the Royal College of Art were commissioned to gather information about what was wrong with the range of beds available in the early ’ 60 s and to produce a new bed, taking into account both function and appearance. The dramatic success of the bed and its derivatives can be seen in many countries. A new specification is part of the King’s Fund centenary celebrations. The King’s Fund bed needs to be systematically reviewed to take into account is-sues as diverse as the increasing proportion of severely disa-bled people managed in their own homes and changes in the staffing and running of hospitals. Readers of Bandolier who would like to make their opinions felt about the bed can write to the King’s Fund.
