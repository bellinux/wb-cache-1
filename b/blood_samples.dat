30|$|Tc- 99 m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (99 mTc-exametazime, 99 mTc-HMAO) is a single-photon {{emission}} {{computed tomography}} (SPECT) radiotracer for CBF assessment [2].

5|$|Exposure to lead {{also can}} be {{evaluated}} by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in <b>blood</b> <b>samples.</b> EP {{is a part of}} red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the blood is high, with a delay of a few weeks. Thus EP levels in conjunction with blood lead levels can suggest the time period of exposure; if blood lead levels are high but EP is still normal, this finding suggests exposure was recent. However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood lead levels below about 35μg/dL. Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in iron deficiency, use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.|$|E

40|$|Background: Qualitative or {{quantitative}} thrombocyte disorder {{will cause}} bleeding and/or thrombosis. Therefore the functional assessment of thrombocyte is important beside the quantitative assay. Aggregation {{is one of}} the important thrombocyte functions and it is often being tested. The assessment for the thrombocyte aggregation is using the <b>blood</b> <b>sample</b> and also adrenalin 1 mg/ml (adrenalin 3 M) as the inductor. Metabolic activities of the thrombocyte are kept during the storage. Objectives: To know the difference of the thrombocyte aggregation score between the immediate <b>blood</b> <b>sample</b> assay and the stored <b>blood</b> <b>sample</b> for one, three and five days. Method and Subject: This is a quasi-experimental research with “time series design”. Thirty subjects were obtained from clinical pathology laboratory in dr. Kariadi hospital. Inclusion criteria in this research were normal subjects. The exclusion criteria were hemolytic blood. The assay was repeated by two different persons, and then the immediate examination was compared to the storage <b>blood</b> <b>sample.</b> Results: There were significant correlation between the first and the second assay (p= 0, 000). Inductor was giving a significant difference (p= 0, 000) for the thrombocyte aggregation score. Inductor was used for accelerate the thrombocyte aggregation. The thrombocyte aggregation score was decreased significantly (p 0, 05) between the third day and the fifth day of storage.

The removal of blood is, however, often required in studies with novel radiotracers, for the determination of metabolites present in the plasma. In this case, the use of an arteriovenous shunt is no more invasive than the use of a catheter solely for <b>blood</b> <b>sampling.</b> Methods using <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> to determine IF may have sufficient volume to measure metabolites directly.

40|$|The proper {{technique}} of capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> {{to determine the}} level of glycemia {{plays an important role}} in diagnostics and therapy of diabetes mellitus. There has been a large shift in this disease in recent years, especially in diagnostics and treatment. It is a disease characterized by high blood sugar levels. In practice, it often happens that although it is a procedure nurses carry out almost daily, during capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> to determine the level of glycemia, a number of errors occurs. This fact inspired me to write a bachelor thesis on the topic "The issue of capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> to determine the level of glycemia?. The empirical part of the thesis deals with both the disease Diabetes Mellitus itself and the capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling.</b> In the introductory part history and definition of diabetes are given, the causes of the disease, complications, diagnostics and treatment of Diabetes Mellitus are described. The issue of capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> to determine the levels of glycemia is discussed in detail, as well as the recommended procedure of capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> and devices designed for the sampling. The practical part of the thesis is focused on selected objectives, research questions and hypotheses. The objective of the research was to identify the factors that may affect the results of the examination, to find out whether nurses follow the recommended procedure for capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> and to identify the most common errors nurses make during the sampling. To achieve the objectives both quantitative and qualitative research surveys were carried out. The qualitative research was conducted by observations of six nurses working in inpatient wards in České Budějovice Hospital, plc, supplemented by interviews with the nurses. The three research questions can be answered as follows. The most common factors that may affect the test results is poor sample handling, sample exposure to unsuitable temperature conditions, and forced squeeze of blood from a finger. While collecting capillary blood nurses often make mistakes in communicating with the patient, when they do not give information about the performed punction and do not properly explain the whole procedure to the patient. They wash their hands before <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> without using a disinfectant. The interviews gave the answer to the last research question that the most common problem the nurses are aware of during capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> is forced squeeze of blood from a finger, poor disinfection of the punction site and a delayed transport to the laboratory. Qualitative research survey was supplemented by quantitative research, which consisted of 66 observations of capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling,</b> which were carried out by nurses in České Budějovice Hospital, plc. This research survey was conducted to verify the results obtained from the qualitative research. This hypothesis was formulated: H 1 : During capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> to determine the level of glycemia nurses most often make mistakes in communication with the patient. Based on the quantitative research, it has been found out that the most common mistake made by nurses is a failure to use a disinfectant for hand hygiene before <b>sampling</b> <b>blood</b> (16 %). The mistake in communication took the third place (14 %). Based on the above results the conclusion can be made that H 1 : During capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> to determine the level of glycemia nurses most often make mistakes in communication with the patient, has not been confirmed. Using the knowledge earned from literature and the conducted research I have proposed a standard of nursing care for nurses called "Capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> to determine the level of glycemia. " Nurses will have an opportunity to have a manual at hand that will serve them as a quide to correctly perform capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> to determine the level of glycemia and they will not be consider the <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> to be a routine procedure...|$|R
