25|$|The {{class of}} all vector <b>bundles</b> {{together}} with <b>bundle</b> morphisms forms a category. Restricting to vector <b>bundles</b> {{for which the}} spaces are manifolds (and the <b>bundle</b> projections are smooth maps) and smooth <b>bundle</b> morphisms we obtain the category of smooth vector <b>bundles.</b> Vector <b>bundle</b> morphisms are a special case {{of the notion of}} a <b>bundle</b> map between fiber <b>bundles,</b> and are also often called (vector) <b>bundle</b> homomorphisms.|$|R
50|$|Examples {{include the}} tensor-algebra <b>bundle,</b> {{exterior}} <b>bundle,</b> and symmetric <b>bundle</b> associated {{to a given}} vector <b>bundle,</b> {{as well as the}} Clifford <b>bundle</b> associated to any Riemannian vector <b>bundle.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{special class}} of fiber <b>bundles,</b> called vector <b>bundles,</b> are those whose fibers are vector spaces (to {{qualify as a}} vector <b>bundle</b> the {{structure}} group of the <b>bundle</b> — see below — must be a linear group). Important examples of vector <b>bundles</b> include the tangent <b>bundle</b> and cotangent <b>bundle</b> of a smooth manifold. From any vector <b>bundle,</b> one can construct the frame <b>bundle</b> of bases which is a principal <b>bundle</b> (see below).|$|R
5|$|<b>Bundling</b> the LITE {{version of}} WinFax {{proved to be}} lucrative for Delrina. Whenever a person used {{the program for the}} first time and {{submitted}} their registration information by fax to the company, Delrina would subsequently mail the user an upgrade offer for the PRO version. This sales technique proved to be very effective, and the firm ended up making most of its sales from these upgrades.|$|E
5|$|Primarily {{because of}} its Genesis <b>bundling,</b> Sonic the Hedgehog contributed to the console's {{popularity}} in North America. During October–December 1991, the Genesis outsold the Super NES by a two-to-one ratio, and at its January 1992 peak claimed 65 {{percent of the market}} for 16-bit consoles. Although Nintendo eventually again overtook Sega, {{this was the first time}} since December 1985 that the company did not lead the console market.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{photoluminescence}} mapping, {{the energy}} of the excitation light can be scanned in Raman measurements, thus producing Raman maps. Those maps also contain oval-shaped features uniquely identifying (n,m) indices. Contrary to PL, Raman mapping detects not only semiconducting but also metallic tubes, and it is less sensitive to nanotube <b>bundling</b> than PL. However, requirement of a tunable laser and a dedicated spectrometer is a strong technical impediment.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, the {{vertical}} <b>bundle</b> and the horizontal <b>bundle</b> are two subbundles of the tangent <b>bundle</b> of a smooth fiber <b>bundle,</b> forming complementary subspaces at each {{point of the}} fibre <b>bundle.</b> The vertical <b>bundle</b> consists of all vectors that are tangent to the fibers, while the horizontal <b>bundle</b> is then a particular choice of a subbundle of tangent <b>bundle</b> which is complementary to vertical <b>bundle.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{scheme to}} {{circumvent}} the settler grants altogether soon emerged. A railroad official hired a surveyor and logger named Stephen A.

In 1904, an investigation by The Oregonian uncovered the scandal, by which time it had grown to such a magnitude that the paper reported that more than 75% of the land sales had violated federal law.|$|E

Stone's picture is, in both meanings of the word, sensational: it's tip-top tabloid journalism. In its bravura and breadth, JFK is seditiously enthralling; in its craft, wondrously complex.|$|E
5000|$|In mathematics, an adjoint <b>bundle</b> [...] is a vector <b>bundle</b> {{naturally}} {{associated to}} any principal <b>bundle.</b> The fibers of the adjoint <b>bundle</b> carry a Lie algebra structure making the adjoint <b>bundle</b> into a (nonassociative) algebra <b>bundle.</b> Adjoint <b>bundles</b> have important {{applications in the}} theory of connections as well as in gauge theory.|$|R
50|$|The tangent frame <b>bundle</b> (or {{simply the}} frame <b>bundle)</b> of a smooth {{manifold}} M is the frame <b>bundle</b> associated to the tangent <b>bundle</b> of M.

5|$|Also on {{show is a}} late 19th-century shambar (large veil) from Bayt Jibrin worn at {{weddings and}} festivals.

Another item in the collection is a headdress (iraqiyeh) embroidered with cross-stitch and decorated with Ottoman coins minted in AH 1223 (1808), as well as Maria Theresa coins. The iraqiyeh was worn by married women and elaborate pieces were passed down as family heirlooms. Long embroidered headbands made of cotton hanging from both sides were wrapped around the woman's braids to facilitate the <b>bundling</b> of her hair, then secured {{to the back of}} the headdress.|$|E
5|$|However, {{others found}} that the <b>bundling</b> of the games was a {{sensible}} business decision, most highlighting {{the risk that the}} sales of Remastered could overshadow those of Infinite Warfare and result in direct competition between the two. Stephen Wright of Gamespresso, meanwhile, agreed with Activision based around the impulsiveness of the Call of Duty fanbase, writing that due to the series' popularity, many of the individuals who felt discontent towards a new title would still choose to buy it regardless. As such, Activision had released the bundle with the knowledge that fans would certainly purchase Infinite Warfare in order to obtain a remaster of Modern Warfare, a game that was held in such high regard. While Wright did disagree with having to pay for an unwanted game in order to obtain another, he expressed faith that the bundle would be good value for money.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Let M be a simply {{connected}} Riemannian symmetric space, with at most {{one flat}} direction. We show that every Riemannian (or unitary) vector <b>bundle</b> with parallel curvature over M is an associated vector <b>bundle</b> of a canonical principal <b>bundle,</b> with the connection {{inherited from the}} principal <b>bundle.</b> The problem of finding Riemannian (or unitary) vector <b>bundles</b> with parallel curvature then reduces to finding representations of the structure group of the canonical principal <b>bundle.</b> This paper concerns connections on Riemannian vector <b>bundles</b> over simply connected symmetric spaces. Given a hypothesis about the Riemannian curvature of a symmetric space, we show that every Riemannian vector <b>bundle</b> with parallel curvature over that space is an associated vector <b>bundle</b> of a canonical principal <b>bundle,</b> with the connection inherited from the principal <b>bundle.</b> The problem of finding Riemannian vector <b>bundles</b> with parallel curvature then reduces to finding representations of the structure group of the canonical principal <b>bundle.</b> Our results apply also to unitary vector <b>bundles,</b> since a C k <b>bundle</b> {{can be viewed as}} an R 2 k <b>bundle</b> together with an additional structure...|$|R

5|$|While Microsoft largely {{failed to}} {{participate}} in the rise of the Internet in the early 1990s, some of the key technologies in which the company had invested to enter the Internet market started to pay off by the mid-90s. One of the most prominent of these was ActiveX, an application programming interface built on the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM); this enabled Microsoft and others to embed controls in many programming languages, including the company's own scripting languages, such as JScript and VBScript. ActiveX included frameworks for documents and server solutions. The company also released the Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, which had built-in support for internet applications. Later in 1997, Microsoft Office 97 as well as Internet Explorer 4.0 were released, marking the beginning of the takeover of the browser market from rival Netscape, and by agreement with Apple Computer, Internet Explorer was bundled with the Apple Macintosh operating system as well as with Windows. Windows CE 2.0, the handheld version of Windows, was released this year, including a host of bug fixes and new features designed to make it more appealing to corporate customers. In October, the Justice Department filed a motion in the federal district court in which they stated that Microsoft had violated an agreement signed in 1994, and asked the court to stop the <b>bundling</b> of Internet Explorer with Windows.|$|E
