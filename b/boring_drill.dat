40|$|In {{machining}} processes, {{drilling operation}} is material removal {{process that has}} been widely used in manufacturing since industrial revolution. The useful life of cutting tool and its operating conditions largely controls the economics of machining operations. Drilling is most frequently performed material removing process and {{is used as a}} preliminary step for many operations, such as reaming, tapping, and <b>boring.</b> <b>Drill</b> wear has a bad effect on the surface finish and dimensional accuracy of the work piece. The surface finish of a machined part {{is one of the most}} important quality characteristics in manufacturing industries. The primary objective of this research is the prediction of suitable parameters for surface roughness in drilling. Cutting speed, cutting force, and machining time were given as inputs to the adaptive fuzzy neural network and neuro-fuzzy analysis for estimating the values of surface roughness by using 2, 3, 4, and 5 membership functions. The best structures were selected based on minimum of summation of square with the actual values with the estimated values by artificial neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and neuro-fuzzy systems. For artificial neural network (ANN) analysis, the number of neurons was selected from 1, 2, 3, …, 20. The learning rate was selected as. 5 and. 5 smoothing factor was used. The inputs were selected as cutting speed, feed, machining time, and thrust force. The best structures of neural networks were selected based on the criteria as the minimum of summation of square with the actual value of surface roughness. Drilling experiments with 10 [*]mm size were performed at two cutting speeds and feeds. Comparative analysis has been done between the actual values and the estimated values obtained by ANFIS, neuro-fuzzy, and ANN analysis...|$|E

50|$|Several {{residents}} had <b>bores</b> <b>drilled,</b> but over half (1000) relied on tank water. A 2½ in. bore behind the Harbour View Hotel had 1920 imp gal/day rising to about 8 ft below the surface, though rather hard and tinged with iron. Of its 160 ft the first 50 ft. was in clay, 4 ft. in hard blue shingle tightly packed {{with a minimum}} of sandy matrix and 106 ft in papa. The 225 ft deep, 3 in. bore for the dairy factory, 70 ft. above sea-level in Rose St, was polluted with ammoniacal nitrogen and chlorides too were high.|$|R

50|$|The {{origins of}} the {{research}} station exist within the Great Barrier Reef Committee, which was established in 1922 by UQ's first Professor of Geology, Henry C. Richards and Sir Matthew Nathan, then Governor of Queensland. Nathan, Richards {{and a group of}} like minded academics and politicians from Australia and overseas, wanted to promote the need for original research, debate and exploration of the Great Barrier Reef within politics, the university and scientific community and in newspapers and public addresses. A <b>bore</b> <b>drill</b> of the reef was undertaken with funding from the Committee in 1926 at Michaelmas Cay. The committee helped to fund a major expedition in 1928-1929 by the Great Barrier Reef (Yonge) expedition to Low Isles reef, north of Cairns to research the zoological, botanical and geomorphological importance of the Great Barrier Reef {{with the support of the}} Queensland government. The results of the Yonge expedition, which yielded a number of reports were published by the British Museum of Natural History (now Natural History Museum) and generated worldwide interest. In 1929, the Australian government was being lobbied to establish a marine institute or a number of research stations on the east coast of Australia. It was hoped that the structures that had been built for the Yonge expedition on Low Isles reef would be suitable as a longer term solution, but these were destroyed by a cyclone in 1934. A further geographical expedition occurred in 1936, and in 1937 another <b>bore</b> <b>drill</b> was conducted at Heron Island. Support for the preservation and conservation of the reef had also been growing.|$|R

The specimen is loaded into the bore, possibly using a small screw ring to hold the sample in place. This cartridge is inserted into an airlock with the bore perpendicular to the TEM optic axis. When sealed, the airlock is manipulated to push the cartridge such that the cartridge falls into place, where the bore hole becomes aligned with the beam axis, such that the beam travels down the cartridge bore and into the specimen. Such designs are typically unable to be tilted without blocking the beam path or interfering with the objective lens.|$|R

5000|$|RAB {{drilling}} is {{used primarily}} for mineral exploration, water <b>bore</b> <b>drilling</b> and blast-hole drilling in mines, {{as well as}} for other applications such as engineering, etc. RAB produces lower quality samples because the cuttings are blown up the outside of the rods and can be contaminated from contact with other rocks.RAB drilling at extreme depth, if it encounters water, may rapidly clog the outside of the hole with debris, precluding removal of drill cuttings from the hole. This can be counteracted, however, with the use of [...] "stabilizers" [...] also known as [...] "reamers", which are large cylindrical pieces of steel attached to the drill string, and made to perfectly fit the size of the hole being drilled. These have sets of rollers on the side, usually with tungsten buttons, that constantly break down cuttings being pushed upwards.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} better {{appreciate}} the full understanding of convergence, {{we need to take}} a long-term historical perspective on technology development (Kodama (2017); Lee (2017)). First of all, we find that convergence is not a direct outcome or consequence of digital technology. Rosenberg (1976) argued that nineteenth century industrialization was characterized by the introduction of a relatively small number of similar productive processes to a large number of industries. The use of machinery in cutting metal into precise shapes, for example, involves a relatively small number of operations such as turning, <b>boring,</b> <b>drilling,</b> milling, planing, grinding, and polishing. The machines encountered similar technical problems: power transmission, control devices, feed mechanisms, friction reduction, etc. Because these processes and problems were common to the production of a wide range of disparate commodities, industries such as firearms, sewing machines, and bicycles, became very closely related (technologically convergent) on a technological basis.|$|R

50|$|In 2007, the Toowoomba City Council {{commenced}} a <b>bore</b> <b>drilling</b> {{program to}} augment the dwindling dam supplies and constructed several subartesian bores across the city and one artesian bore at Wetalla in the city's north. Many of the subartesian bores provided potable water with a reliable yield and have been developed into production however the artesian bore's water quality was very poor, prohibiting development as a potable source. This was an expensive setback for the city as the cost was over A$2 million for drilling to over 700 metres. In January 2008, yield testing had been stalled due to the unavailability of appropriate pumping equipment. The Toowoomba Regional Council began supplementing the city's water supply with bore water from the Great Artesian Basin in September 2009.

40|$|Chatter {{vibrations}} {{in cutting}} processes are {{studied in the}} present paper. A unified approach for the calculation of the stability lobes for turning, <b>boring,</b> <b>drilling</b> and milling processes in the frequency domain is presented. The method {{can be used for}} a fast and reliable identification of the stability lobes and can take into account nonlinear shearing forces, as well as process damping forces. The applicability of Tlusty's law, which is a simple scalar relationship between the real part of the oriented transfer function of the structure and the limiting chip width, is extended to milling and any other multi-dimensional chatter problem without neglecting the coupled dynamics. The given analysis is suitable for getting a deep understanding of the chatter stability dependent on the parameters of the cutting process and the structure. Basic examples based on experimental data of real machine tools include the dependence of the stability behavior on the rotational direction in turning, the effect of axial-torsional structural coupling in drilling, and the dynamics of slot milling...|$|R
