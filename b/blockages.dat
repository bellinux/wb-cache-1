5|$|Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} skin {{disease of the}} pilosebaceous unit and {{develops}} due to <b>blockages</b> in the skin's hair follicles. These <b>blockages</b> are thought to occur {{as a result of}} the following four abnormal processes: a higher than normal amount of oily sebum production (influenced by androgens), excessive deposition of the protein keratin leading to comedo formation, colonization of the follicle by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) bacteria, and the local release of pro-inflammatory chemicals in the skin.|$|E
5|$|A {{consistent}} {{shift from}} land based trade to sea based trade {{has been recorded}} since the last three millennia.

5|$|Some {{of these}} lava flows blocked rivers and streams, {{impounding}} small lakes and ephemeral ponds in the process. About 100,000years ago, basalt from the largest cinder cone in the park, Crater Hill, flowed over the area. The lava traveled into Coalpits and Scoggins Washes {{to the south}} and accumulated to a depth of over 400ft (122m) in the ancestral Virgin River valley near the present-day ghost town of Grafton, Utah. Water impounded behind the two <b>blockages,</b> forming Coalpits Lake and Lake Grafton respectively.|$|E
40|$|The {{effective}} <b>blockage</b> of a flame holder, {{as regards}} {{its ability to}} stabilize a flame, has been demonstrated to be its aerodynamic <b>blockage.</b> A general method of determining the aerodynamic <b>blockage</b> of a flame holder, employing ideal flow theory, has been developed. The predicted variation of aerodynamic <b>blockage</b> with geometric <b>blockage</b> agrees well with that experimentally observed for conical flame holders. The aerodynamic <b>blockage</b> {{was found to be}} directly proportional to the geometric <b>blockage,</b> for values less than 25 %. Beyond this limit of geometric <b>blockage,</b> flow confinement effects were found to be significant...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} a partial <b>blockage</b> on {{pipeline}} transients are investigated analytically. A partial <b>blockage</b> is simulated using an orifice equation, {{and the influence of}} the <b>blockage</b> on the unsteady pipe flow is considered in the governing equations using a Dirac delta function. A simplified, linear dimensionless governing equation has been derived, and an analytical solution expressed in terms of a Fourier series has been developed under nonvarying boundary conditions. The linear analysis indicates that pipe friction and a partial <b>blockage</b> both introduce damping on fluid transients. The friction damping and <b>blockage</b> damping are exponential for each of the individual harmonic components. For each individual harmonic component, the blockage-induced damping depends on the <b>blockage</b> magnitude and position and is also independent of measurement location and the transient event. A new <b>blockage</b> detection method using the blockage-induced transient damping is developed based on the analytical solution. The magnitude of the blockage-induced damping rate indicates the size of the <b>blockage,</b> and the ratios of different damping rates can be used to locate the <b>blockage.</b> The proposed <b>blockage</b> detection method has been successfully used in detecting, locating, and quantifying a pipe <b>blockage</b> based on laboratory experiments.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the scouring process and the current empirical design equations is based on laboratory data that may have exceeded acceptable <b>blockage.</b> Previous literature indicates that scour may only be significantly affected when <b>blockage</b> ratio is greater than 10 %. Also, some recent literature indicates that <b>blockage</b> may {{have a significant effect}} on the scour profile for <b>blockage</b> ratios less than 10 %. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of <b>blockage</b> (wall interference) on local pier scour for circular piers in clear water conditions by varying channel width and pier diameter to obtain <b>blockage</b> ratios between 2. 5 % and 11. 4 %. Maintaining identical flow conditions for several <b>blockage</b> ratios was an important aspect of this study in order to maintain consistency throughout the experiments. An analysis of <b>blockage</b> for different pier sizes and relative coarseness, D/d 50, was used to provide a clearer {{understanding of}} when <b>blockage</b> effects occur in experimental study...|$|R
5|$|Maritime trade {{began with}} safer coastal trade and evolved with the {{manipulation}} of the monsoon winds, soon resulting in trade crossing boundaries such as the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. South Asia had multiple maritime trade routes which connected it to Southeast Asia, thereby making the control of one route resulting in maritime monopoly difficult. Indian connections to various Southeast Asian states buffered it from <b>blockages</b> on other routes. By making use of the maritime trade routes, bulk commodity trade became possible for the Romans in the 2nd century BCE. A Roman trading vessel could span the Mediterranean in a month at one-sixtieth the cost of over-land routes.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{resource}} {{assessment of}} the Cumberland Island National Seashore by the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) estimated that there were approximately 200 feral horses on Cumberland Island. As of 2010, 121 horses were counted on the island during the yearly census. Censuses conducted between 2000 and 2010 have counted between 120 and 154 horses. Not all horses are counted during the census, and park management estimates that approximately 50 horses are missed in the counts each year, bringing the 2010 total to around 170 horses. The life span of horses on Cumberland Island is approximately half that of their ancestors, due to infestations of parasites and disease. They also suffer from digestive issues linked to the ingestion of {{a great amount of}} sand, which causes intestinal <b>blockages</b> and abdominal distension.|$|E
5|$|At Ostend, Vindictive did prevent larger {{warships}} {{passing through}} the channel, although smaller craft could still come and go at will. The larger warships in Bruges were trapped there for the remaining months of the war; the town was captured by the Allies in October 1918. The <b>blockages</b> at Ostend and Zeebrugge took several years to clear completely, not being totally removed until 1921. On a strategic scale {{the effects of the}} raids at Ostend and Zeebrugge on the battle of the Atlantic were negligible. Despite this, in Britain the Ostend Raid was feted as a success. Three Victoria Crosses and a host of lesser awards were given to the men involved. The Admiralty presented it as a fine example of daring and careful planning from the Royal Navy, providing a valuable morale boost at {{one of the most critical}} moments of the war.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the mechanisms by which histamine causes nasal <b>blockage.</b> Histamine, 40 – 800 [*]μg, intranasally into each nostril, induced significant <b>blockage</b> of the nasal airway in normal human subjects, as measured by acoustic rhinometry. Oral pretreatment with cetirizine, 5 – 30 [*]mg, the H 1 antagonist, failed to reverse completely the nasal <b>blockage</b> induced by histamine, 400 [*]μg. Dimaprit, 50 – 200 [*]μg, the H 2 agonist, intranasally, caused nasal <b>blockage,</b> which was reversed by oral pretreatment with ranitidine, 75 [*]mg, the H 2 antagonist. A combination of cetirizine, 20 [*]mg, and ranitidine, 75 [*]mg, caused greater inhibition of the nasal <b>blockage</b> caused by histamine, 400 [*]μg, than cetirizine alone. In the presence of both antagonists, there was residual histamine-induced nasal <b>blockage.</b> R-α-methylhistamine (R-α-MeH), 100 – 600 [*]μg, the H 3 agonist, intranasally, caused nasal <b>blockage,</b> which was not inhibited by either cetirizine or ranitidine. Thioperamide, 700 [*]μg, the H 3 antagonist, intranasally, reversed the R-α-MeH-induced nasal <b>blockage.</b> Thioperamide alone had no significant action on the nasal <b>blockage</b> induced by histamine, 400 and 1000 [*]μg, but, in the presence of cetirizine, 20 [*]mg, thioperamide further reduced the histamine-induced nasal <b>blockage.</b> Corynanthine, 2 [*]mg, the α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist, administered intranasally, caused nasal <b>blockage.</b> Corynanthine produced a greater increase in nasal <b>blockage</b> when in combination with bradykinin compared to its combination with R-α-MeH. There appears to be a contribution of H 1, H 2 and H 3 receptors to histamine-induced nasal <b>blockage</b> in normal human subjects. The sympathetic nervous system actively maintains nasal patency and we suggest that activation of nasal H 3 receptors may downregulate sympathetic activity...|$|R
40|$|An {{axial-flow fan}} rotor was tested with four {{configurations}} of tip-annulus-area <b>blockage</b> to speeds {{as high as}} 0. 8 of design speed. The rotor performance with the four <b>blockage</b> configurations is compared with the unblocked rotor performance and with <b>blockage</b> configurations previously investigated. The <b>blockage</b> configurations enable the rotor to operate in a stable condition, to much lower flows than the unblocked rotor, with no evidence of rotating stall. The <b>blockage</b> configurations were effective in reducing rotor torque and weight flow but were accompanied by reductions in pressure ratio and efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{of a series}} of experiments which were carried out with great care to produce accurate, comparable results in which the relatively small changes in the flow past a circular cylinder associated with varying <b>blockage</b> ratios can be clearly distinguished. The experiments cover a range of <b>blockage</b> from 2 to 16 % and of aspect ratios from 4 to 10. End plates were fitted to the cylinders in all experiments. For <b>blockage</b> ratios less than 6 y 0, it is shown that the effects of <b>blockage</b> on pressure distribution and the drag coefficient arc small and that the Strouhal number is unaffected by <b>blockage.</b> For <b>blockage</b> ratios in the range 6 -lSyo, there is considerable distortion of the flow due to <b>blockage</b> and the effects are complex. The pressure distribution is of a different form and the Strouhal number changes. However, conflicting influences result in a blocked drag coefficient which is not verydifferent from that at no <b>blockage.</b> Reduction in aspect ratio has effects on dragcoefficient and on base pressure coefficient which are similar to those associated with increase in <b>blockage</b> ratio. It is concluded that <b>blockage</b> correction procedures based on the momentum method and on the image method are unsatisfactory in their prediction of the unblocked drag coefficient but the momentum method predicts the unblocked base pressure coefficient quite well...|$|R
5|$|Despite German {{claims that}} the {{blockage}} did not impede their operations, the operation to close the Ostend canal {{seemed to have been}} at least partially successful. The channel was largely blocked and so Bruges was ostensibly closed off from the open sea, even if the position of the blockship meant that smaller ships could get through. In fact, the entire operation had been rendered moot before it even began, due to events at the wider canal in Zeebrugge. British assessments of that operation had proven optimistic and the channel there had not been properly closed. Small coastal submarines of the UC class had been able to pass through the channel as early as the morning after the Zeebrugge Raid and German naval engineers were able to dredge channels around the <b>blockages</b> at both ports over the coming weeks.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Cosme caused minor, but widespread, {{damage on}} {{mainland}} Mexico. Unstable structures, {{such as those}} made of wood and coconut, suffered the most damage {{as a result of}} the storm. Flooding and multiple landslides also left damaged and caused road <b>blockages.</b> Heavy rains were reported in southwest and south central Mexico, particularly in Michoacan. High waves were reported along the coast from Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, to Acapulco, Guerrero. In Guerrero, rain caused at least 24landslides, blocking state highways in several locations. Precipitation {{as a result of the}} storm system also resulted in flooding in the port city of Acapulco. Storm flooding damaged 50homes, mainly due to the overflown streams of the Tlapa River. In Colima, coastal flooding induced by a storm surge damaged 34 tourist facilities, according to the Secretary of State Economic Development. Most of these facilities were located in the municipalities of Tecomny and Armory.|$|E
5|$|While in Lexington for a {{deposition}} on May 26, 2002, Wilkinson began to experience chest pains and {{was admitted to}} St. Joseph's Hospital. Doctors diagnosed him with arterial <b>blockages</b> and scheduled him for arterial bypass surgery. Before the surgery could be performed, however, doctors discovered another lymphatic mass. Wilkinson began taking chemotherapy, and doctors removed the mass on June 4, 2002. Wilkinson was placed on life support on June 26, 2002. He suffered a stroke on July 4, 2002. Wilkinson had previously instructed his family not to continue life support after all hope of recovery was gone; accordingly, they decided to withdraw life support, and Wilkinson died on July 5, 2002. He was originally buried at Blue Grass Memorial Gardens in Nicholasville, Kentucky. In August 2002, his coffin was moved to a locked mausoleum at Sarasota Memorial Park in Sarasota, Florida; the family chose July 4, 2002 as the date of death for his marker. The city of Liberty dubbed the stretch of the U.S. 127 bypass {{that runs through the}} city Wallace Wilkinson Boulevard in 1987.|$|E
30|$|The {{velocity}} of fluid particles around the test {{model in the}} pipe varied considerably and increased from 25  % <b>blockage</b> stage to 99  % <b>blockage</b> stage, as shown in Fig.  5. In Fig.  5, 2 D velocity vectors illustrate the flow pattern downstream of the test model as the <b>blockage</b> percentage increased at the symmetry plane. The section indicated by the red square is where the PIV measurements were conducted. For 99  % <b>blockage</b> (Fig.  5 d), the velocities of the most of fluid particles in the measurement section decreased significantly and the recirculation structure and flow pattern disappeared. As the graph shows, {{the length of the}} vectors represents the velocity, which falls from 25  % <b>blockage</b> stage to 99  % <b>blockage</b> stage. The velocity value was the smallest in the case of 99  % <b>blockage</b> because the flow was almost completely stopped. As proposed by Oztop et al. (2012) for turbulent flow over a double forward-facing step with obstacles, an increase in the step height produced the same distribution of the velocity vector with an increase in the <b>blockage</b> percentage.|$|R
30|$|If the <b>blockage</b> {{ratio is}} smaller, the drag becomes smaller. In practice, the <b>blockage</b> ratio is {{impossible}} to be very small because of the limitation of the pipe’s section size.

40|$|Blood {{behaviour}} under shear-stress is {{assessed by}} a filter method in the Caerphilly Prospective Heart Study. Associations with haemostatic and lifestyle factors in 941 men aged 55 to 69 years are reported. The importance of platelets in filter <b>blockage</b> is confirmed, and roles for white cells and plasma viscosity in determining flow prior to <b>blockage</b> are identified. The aspect of platelet activity involved in <b>blockage</b> {{appears to be}} independent of mechanisms mediated by cyclo-oxygenase and adenosine diphosphate. von Willebrand factor however is associated with filter <b>blockage,</b> probably as an inter-platelet ligand. Fibrinogen is not required for <b>blockage.</b> Men regularly consuming alcohol or garlic supplements show reduced <b>blockage,</b> and biochemical mechanisms are suggested which might explain these associations. No effects of aspirin, smoking or consumption of fish oil supplements were noted. Shear-induced filter <b>blockage</b> is a simple method for measuring complex flow-dependent interactions of haemostatic factors. Its application {{in a wide range}} of investigations, including epidemiological studies, would appear to be appropriate...|$|R
5|$|The heavy {{rainfall}} {{was the most}} destructive aspect of Tropical Storm Bret in Venezuela. On the offshore Isla Margaria, the rains flooded the primary hospital, and rivers overflowed, although damage was minimal. On the mainland, {{heavy rainfall}} caused damaging mudslides and flooding, and entire houses buried {{in the middle of}} the night with little notice. Flooded rivers washed away cars and homes in the hills of Caracas, mostly along the flooded La Guarre River. Floodwaters mixed with raw sewage from damaged water lines across the region. Residents returned to damaged homes despite warnings. Damage was worst in Petare, La Vega, and El Valle, all surrounding Caracas on insecure mountainsides. One home was wrecked in Petare, killing four family members. At least 19people perished in Miranda state, and another three deaths were reported in Aragua due to landslides. Residents requested assistance from the local fire company, although disrupted telephone service created an atmosphere of confusion. Strong winds also destroyed the roofs of other houses, and areas were left without power. Portions of the Pan-American Highway and a coastal road were disrupted by landslides, and the state of Barinas was largely isolated due to road <b>blockages.</b> Most roads west of Caracas were likewise blocked.|$|E
5|$|Wilkinson {{was able}} to secure passage of a {{constitutional}} amendment allowing a state lottery. He also helped craft a significant education reform bill {{in response to a}} ruling by the Kentucky Supreme Court that declared the state's entire public school system unconstitutional. Wilkinson's term was plagued by political scandal and an uneasy relationship with the state legislature. He advocated an amendment to the state constitution that would allow him to seek a second consecutive term as governor, but the amendment was defeated in the General Assembly. His wife Martha attempted to succeed him, but withdrew from the campaign amid weak support for her candidacy. Following his term as governor, Wilkinson encountered difficult financial times. In 2001, he was sued by a group of creditors, and during the proceedings, it was revealed that he was operating a Ponzi scheme to keep his businesses afloat. Both he and his wife Martha filed for bankruptcy later that year. In 2002, Wilkinson was hospitalized with arterial <b>blockages.</b> His condition was complicated by a recurrence of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He suffered a stroke on July 4, 2002, and his family withdrew his life support the following day in accordance with his previously-expressed wishes.|$|E
5|$|In general, a Vortigaunt is a {{somewhat}} humanoid figure with two legs and two arms, but has an additional arm protruding from its thorax. Vortigaunts have mottled green skin and digitigrade legs, {{allowing them to}} move quickly. Typically, Vortigaunts have a slightly hunched posture. In addition, Vortigaunts have sharp teeth, clawed hands, strong senses, and their faces are dominated by a large red eye. In Half-Life, this eye is surrounded by five smaller eyes, although, in Half-Life 2, this {{has been reduced to}} three smaller eyes. A key aspect of the Vortigaunts is their ability to summon energy to their command without the need for any equipment. In-game, this ability is most commonly used as a means of attack, with Vortigaunts' hurling the energy towards foes in the form of green electrical bolts. In addition, Vortigaunts {{have been shown to be}} able to use the energy for other purposes, such as assisting in repair work, removing rubble and <b>blockages,</b> recharging the player's HEV suit or powering up electrical generators. Enslaved Vortigaunts are depicted with green collars and shackles, although the means by which these control Vortigaunts is not explored. Vortigaunts are not typically seen wearing clothing, although several Vortigaunts are observed wearing lab coats and chef's clothing in the course of Half-Life 2 and its expansions. Vortigaunts are depicted as meat eaters; the player can observe Vortigaunts' eating human corpses in Half-Life and cooking headcrabs in Half-Life 2, although Half-Life 2 also shows Vortigaunts working in kitchens with chef hats, preparing soups and salads, suggesting that Vortigaunts are omnivores.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{conventional}} search methods using static evaluation at {{leaf nodes}} {{are liable to}} missing {{the fact that no}} win goal exists in certain positions. <b>Blockage</b> positions, in which neither side can penetrate into the opponent’s camp, are a prominent example of such positions.

In this paper we introduce a <b>blockage</b> detection method, which manages to detect a large set of <b>blockage</b> positions in pawn endgames, with practically no additional overhead. By examining different aspects of the pawn structure, it checks whether the pawns form a <b>blockage</b> which prevents the king from penetrating into the opponent’s camp.
