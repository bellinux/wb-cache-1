30|$|Test {{development}} {{was guided by}} the following assumptions about teaching <b>business</b> and <b>economics</b> in Germany; however, we also argue for why the test might be appropriate for use in other countries. In general secondary education in Germany, <b>business</b> and <b>economics</b> concepts are taught mostly in other subjects (e.g., geography, political and social studies). Most <b>business</b> and <b>economics</b> teachers in Germany work in commercial vocational and commercial upper secondary schools, where <b>business</b> and <b>economics</b> content is taught systematically. The curricular structure of <b>business</b> and <b>economics</b> is very diverse, organized in subjects at commercial high school and in fields geared towards various professions at vocational schools. For example, prospective industrial managers take courses on identifying value streams and indicators; prospective wholesalers take courses on controlling buying processes. Therefore, most <b>business</b> and <b>economics</b> teachers in Germany need PCK {{that enables them to}} teach diverse, practically relevant, action-oriented content for a large number of commercial professions.|$|R
30|$|The paper–pencil test we {{presented}} in this paper combined with our newly developed video-/performance-based instrument will serve as a valuable tool to foster professional teaching and teacher education in the subject area of <b>business</b> and <b>economics.</b> In the future, a valid and comprehensive measure of teachers’ PCK of <b>business</b> and <b>economics</b> could provide {{a better understanding of the}} role PCK plays for student learning and of how teachers acquire PCK of <b>business</b> and <b>economics</b> during teacher education and professional practice. To this end, formative diagnostic assessment could be employed during the different phases of teacher education and practical training. Although the test instrument was created for use in Germany, it is based on internationally agreed upon core concepts of <b>business</b> and <b>economics</b> and adheres to content standards and, therefore, could be adapted for use to support <b>business</b> and <b>economics</b> education in other countries.|$|R

30|$|Recent {{research}} indicates that success in studying <b>business</b> and <b>economics</b> depends significantly on students’ prior knowledge of <b>business</b> and <b>economics</b> acquired at secondary or vocational schools (Brückner et al. 2015; Gill and Gratton-Lavoie 2011; Walstad 2013). While this prior knowledge can be appropriately assessed, teachers’ PCK of <b>business</b> and <b>economics,</b> which shapes the quality of instruction and likely influences student learning, {{has not yet been}} assessed directly, largely {{due to a lack of}} appropriate instruments for valid assessment (Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia et al. 2015).|$|R
