5|$|As <b>bacon</b> {{ice cream}} {{was created in}} 1992 and came to {{prominence}} in the 2000s, there is no traditional recipe. Recipes generally involve adding <b>bacon</b> to a standard sweet ice cream recipe, often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee, rum or pecan. The saltiness of the <b>bacon</b> highlights {{the sweetness of the}} ice cream. According to one Wired.com article, the <b>bacon</b> should be candied prior to addition, a process which involves baking the <b>bacon</b> in a sugar syrup. This has the benefit of sweetening the <b>bacon,</b> in a similar manner to pancakes {{in some parts of the}} United States.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{had been}} {{painting}} for almost twenty years, <b>Bacon</b> steadfastly insisted that Three Studies was the fons et origo of his career.
