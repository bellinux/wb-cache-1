The film was shot in California, Nevada, Kansas, Arizona and Argentina. The soundtrack became famous for the Martians' quirky speech pattern, which was created by reversing the sound of a duck's quack.|$|E

5|$|Although {{setting the}} state budget is a {{legislative}} function in many states, Kentucky governors are required by statute to present a proposed biennial <b>budget</b> <b>to</b> the General Assembly for approval shortly after the beginning of its even-year sessions. The governor's budget has often been approved with few changes, but since the Republicans {{took control of the}} state senate {{for the first time in}} 1999, approval has become a much more contentious process. The General Assembly failed to pass a budget before the end of its session in both 2002 and 2004. In both cases, the state operated under an executive spending plan drafted by the governor until the legislature could re-convene and pass a budget. In 2005 the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the governor had no authority to expend funds without legislative approval, and that if legislators failed to pass a budget in the future, only expenditures explicitly authorized in the state constitution could be made.|$|E
5|$|Darabont {{purchased}} the film rights to King's story in 1987, but development {{did not begin}} until five years later when he wrote the script over an eight-week period. Two weeks after submitting his script to the Castle Rock Entertainment film studio, Darabont secured a $25 million <b>budget</b> <b>to</b> produce The Shawshank Redemption, which started pre-production in January 1993. While the film is set in Maine, principal photography took place almost entirely in Mansfield, Ohio, with the Ohio State Reformatory serving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted many notable stars of {{the time for the}} lead roles including Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, and Kevin Costner. Thomas Newman provided the film's score.|$|E
5|$|Expressions {{of sympathy}} and {{solidarity}} from the European film community manifested in renewed assurances of continued {{support from the}} production's German partners, ARTE, and the French National Film Centre (whose support was conditional on the film having 51% of its dialogue in French). New French financing was secured from production company Mezzanine Film, and in Hungary, the Hungarian Motion Picture Foundation (MMKA) and the Minister of Culture pledged to back the production if a guarantee could {{be made that the}} film would be finished safely. A compromise filming schedule was negotiated whereby a quarter of the shoot would take place in Eastern Europe rather than Corsica and fewer shooting days would be allotted. This allowed the original €5 million <b>budget</b> <b>to</b> be reduced by €700,000 to the amount available. With the funding promises secured and a revised shooting schedule, the film's producers forged a new co-production contract in July 2005.|$|E
