5|$|<b>Barnacles</b> are {{normally}} sessile animals unable to evade predators. When they {{are attached to}} a scallop they benefit from the defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation. The scallop is disadvantaged because the presence of <b>barnacles</b> may reduce its ability to swim. It {{has been found that}} encrusting sponges emit chemicals that discourage barnacle larvae from settling nearby. The larvae preferentially settle on shells that are not encrusted with sponges. This is another way in which encrusting sponges are of advantage to the scallops which are less impeded in their ability to swim by sponges than they are by <b>barnacles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many parasites {{latch onto}} whales, notably whale lice and whale <b>barnacles.</b> Almost all species of whale lice are {{specialized}} towards a certain species of whale, and {{there can be}} more than one species per whale. Whale lice eat dead skin, resulting in minor wounds in the skin. Whale louse infestations are especially evident in right whales, where colonies propagate on their callosities. Though not a parasite, whale <b>barnacles</b> latch onto the skin of a whale during their larval stage. However, in doing so it does not harm nor benefit the whale, so their relationship is often labeled as an example of commensalism. Some baleen whales will deliberately rub themselves on substrate to dislodge parasites. Some species of barnacle, such as Conchoderma auritum and whale <b>barnacles,</b> attach to the baleen plates, though this seldom occurs. A species of copepod, Balaenophilus unisetus, inhabits baleen plates of whales in tropical waters. A species of Antarctic diatom, Cocconeis ceticola, forms a film on the skin, which takes a month to develop; this film causes minor damage to the skin. They are also plagued by internal parasites such as stomach worms, cestodes, nematodes, liver flukes, and acanthocephalans.|$|E
5|$|Forty leagues (120nautical {{miles or}} around 220km) {{to the east}} of Surinam, Low and his fleet of two ships (the Rose Pink and the Fancy, captained by a young Charles Harris) dropped anchor to remove growth such as seaweed and <b>barnacles</b> from the outside of the boats, in a process known as careening, {{necessary}} because no dry dock was available to pirates.|$|E
50|$|Amphibalanus amphitrite is {{a species}} of acorn <b>barnacle</b> in the Balanidae family. Its common names include the striped <b>barnacle,</b> the purple acorn <b>barnacle</b> and Amphitrite's rock <b>barnacle.</b> It is found in warm and {{temperate}} waters worldwide.|$|R
50|$|The species Balanus balanoides (common <b>barnacle,</b> common rock <b>barnacle,</b> {{northern}} rock <b>barnacle)</b> {{has been}} reclassified as Semibalanus balanoides {{in the family}} Archaeobalanidae, due to its membranous base.|$|R
50|$|When {{a product}} design change is required, often and when possible, a <b>barnacle</b> is {{designed}} so that existing products can be modified with the design change using the <b>barnacle.</b> By using a <b>barnacle,</b> {{the idea is that}} existing products {{do not need to be}} scrapped and replaced so in this case the use of a <b>barnacle</b> is an economic decision. The <b>barnacle</b> work may be done in the field using portable tools and components or it may require a product recall with the <b>barnacle</b> work being done on the manufacturing floor.|$|R
5|$|On {{the hill}} summits {{that dot the}} {{headlands}} are heather and gorse, shaped by the prevailing wind; thrift and wild thyme thrive on the acidic soil. The cliffs are a stronghold of the chough, and a nesting place for razorbills and guillemots. On the lower rocks, in reach of the waves, are plentiful lichens, seaweeds, sponges, limpets and <b>barnacles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plants figure {{prominently}} in mythology and religion, where they symbolise themes such as fertility, growth, immortality and rebirth, {{and may be}} more or less magical. Thus in Latvian mythology, Austras Koks is a tree which grows {{from the start of the}} Sun's daily journey across the sky. A different cosmic tree is Yggdrasil, the World tree of Norse mythology, on which Odin hung. Different again is the barnacle tree, believed in the Middle Ages to have <b>barnacles</b> that opened to reveal geese, a story which may perhaps have started from an observation of goose <b>barnacles</b> growing on driftwood. Greek mythology mentions many plants and flowers, where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms.|$|E
5|$|The diet of many storm petrels {{species is}} poorly known owing to {{difficulties}} in researching; overall {{the family is}} thought to concentrate on crustaceans. Small fish, oil droplets and molluscs are also taken by many species. Some species {{are known to be}} rather more specialised; the grey-backed storm petrel is known to concentrate on the larvae of goose <b>barnacles.</b>|$|E

5|$|Copper is biostatic, meaning {{bacteria}} {{and many other}} forms of life will not grow on it. For this reason {{it has long been}} used to line parts of ships to protect against <b>barnacles</b> and mussels. It was originally used pure, but has since been superseded by Muntz metal and copper-based paint. Similarly, as discussed in copper alloys in aquaculture, copper alloys have become important netting materials in the aquaculture industry because they are antimicrobial and prevent biofouling, even in extreme conditions and have strong structural and corrosion-resistant properties in marine environments.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile loggerheads {{share the}} Sargassum habitat {{with a variety}} of other organisms. The mats of Sargassum contain as many as 100 {{different}} species of animals on which the juveniles feed. Some of the prey, such as ants, flies, bugs, leafhoppers, and beetles, are carried by the wind to these areas. plant prey of the mats include <b>barnacles,</b> small crab larvae, fish eggs, and plantonn colonies. Marine mammals and commercial fish, such as tuna, also inhabit the mats.|$|E
5|$|Like most brown algae, Postelsia {{goes through}} {{alternation}} of generations, {{and is an}} annual species. The diploid sporophyte produces, through meiosis, haploid spores, which drip down through the grooves in the blades onto the substrate, which may be mussels, <b>barnacles,</b> or bare rock. These spores develop, through mitosis, into small, multicellular haploid gametophytes, male and female. The male and female gametophytes create sperm and eggs, respectively. The sperm of the male reaches the female egg and fertilizes, resulting in a diploid zygote, which develops into a new sporophyte.|$|E

50|$|The word <b>barnacle</b> is a slang {{term used}} in {{electrical}} engineering to indicate a change made to a product on the manufacturing floor that {{was not part of}} the original product design. A <b>barnacle</b> is typically used to correct a defect in the product or as a way of enhancing the product with new functionality. A <b>barnacle</b> is normally a quick fix that is used until the product design can be redone incorporating the <b>barnacle</b> into the actual product so that when manufactured, the <b>barnacle</b> step in manufacturing is no longer required.A <b>barnacle</b> may also be added in the field in order to correct a design or manufacturing defect.|$|R
5|$|Marine {{researchers}} {{note that}} mammals and birds {{get the most}} attention but smaller creatures {{at the base of}} the ocean food chain are also harmed by the oil. Life on the sea floor and near the shore such as mussels, <b>barnacles,</b> and other shellfish are unable to move out of the way.

5|$|Crustaceans have a {{rich and}} {{extensive}} fossil record, which begins with animals such as Canadaspis and Perspicaris from the Middle Cambrian age Burgess Shale. Most of the major groups of crustaceans appear in the fossil record {{before the end of}} the Cambrian, namely the Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda (including <b>barnacles</b> and tongue worms) and Malacostraca; there is some debate as to whether or not Cambrian animals assigned to Ostracoda are truly ostracods, which would otherwise start in the Ordovician. The only classes to appear later are the Cephalocarida, which have no fossil record, and the Remipedia, which were first described from the fossil Tesnusocaris goldichi, but do not appear until the Carboniferous. Most of the early crustaceans are rare, but fossil crustaceans become abundant from the Carboniferous period onwards.|$|E

Greek mythology mentions many plants and flowers, where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms. Magic plants are found, too, in Serbian mythology, where the raskovnik is supposed to be able to open any lock. In Buddhist symbolism, both the lotus and the Bodhi Tree are significant. The lotus is one of the Ashtamangala (eight auspicious signs) shared between Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, representing the primordial purity of body, speech, and mind, floating above the muddy waters of attachment and desire. The Bodhi Tree is the sacred fig tree under which the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment; the name is also given to other Bodhi trees thought to have been propagated from the original tree.|$|E
