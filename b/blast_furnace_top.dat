40|$|The Bischoff <b>Blast</b> <b>Furnace</b> <b>Top</b> Gas Process {{for high}} {{pressure}} blast furnaces {{is presented as}} an example of a modern gas treatment process in the iron and steel industry: the work potential of the high pressure top gas is utilized in a plant comprising a gas cleaning unit for dust removal and a turbine for converting the recoverable thermal energy into mechanical and electrical energy. The adjustable annular gap scrubber for separating fine dust also serves as an element for regulating the gas pressure at the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>top</b> so that pressure control by the turbine and its control gear is no longer necessary. Moreover, in the event of a turbine outage the annular gap scrubber can be used as a low noise, pressure-throttling element. The economic use of a turbine for recovering energy from top gas depends on many parameters, such as top pressure, top gas rate, clean gas temperature, local cost of electric power, etc. A profitability analysis for a specific installation shows a remarkably short payback period. The process incorporates a new concept in blast air compression. Mechanical energy from the turbine is transferred directly to the axial flow compressor so that the prior conversion of energy via the power generating cycle is dispensed with. Coupled to the turbine is the compressor motor which, while rated to cover the full power requirement, uses about 40 % less electrical power from the power supply system. Finally, {{as an example of}} the future potential of this process, a new continuous steelmaking process is presented which employs a closed top converter. The gas, held under pressure during refining, is subsequently cleaned and expanded as the blast furnace process described above. This gas is cleaned without any entrainment of air to furnish a gaseous fuel of high calorific value. Since the steelmaking process is continuous, the gas is constantly available and can be fed into the distribution system without any intermediate storage...|$|E

It not only embodies in saving energy utilization of blast furnace gas, but also can stabilize a top pressure, reduce smelted fluctuation, and make the blast furnace more stable.

The most promising applications for the SEWGS technology are IGCC power plants and in combined cycles power plants fuelled with <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>top</b> gas. Extensive sorbent development work resulted in a new sorbent called ALKASORB+ with a high capacity resulting in cost of CO 2 avoided for the IGCC application of € 23. This is a reduction of almost 40 % compared to the Selexol capture case. Since ALKASORB+ requires much less steam in the regeneration, the specific primary energy consumption is reduced to 44 % below the specific energy consumption for the Selexol (2. 08 versus 3. 71 MJLHV/kgCO 2). From a technical point of view SEWGS is ready {{to move to the}} next development level, which is a pilot plant installation with a capacity of 35 ton CO 2 per day. This is over 500 times larger than the current ECN's multi column SEWGS installation, but still 50 times smaller than an envisaged commercial scale installation.

40|$|When using 100 % self-fluxed pellets in the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> burden, <b>top</b> charged fluxes, {{especially}} the BOF-slag, may cause irregularities in operation. The major reason has been theoretically {{attributed to the}} problematic slag formation in the furnace. As the melting of pellets {{is the first step}} of the slag formation process, the softening and melting properties of LKAB's self-fluxed pellets with and without addition of fluxes are studied experimentally. The results show that the softening and melting properties of the two types of LKAB's self-fluxed pellets are quite suitable for <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> operation. Contrarily, the melting-down characteristics of BOF-slag are variable and harmful to the slag formation under a reducing atmosphere. Adding 5 % BOF-slag to the self-fluxed pellets can considerably worsen the softening and melting properties of pellets. It can either increase the softening and melting temperature interval substantially or cause the precipitation of solid phases, mainly di-calcium silicates, in the slag. It is quite likely that the resulting slag will therefore become very viscous, even entirely blocking the melting down of the pellets up to a temperature 1 520 °C.

40|$|Steel {{production}} {{is one of}} the most energy-intensive and, therefore, CO 2 emitting industry. This {{production is}} responsible for an estimated 5. 2 % of total global greenhouse gas emissions and 21 % of total EU industrial emissions. Approximately 80 - 90 % of these emissions are connected to the blast furnace converter process. The size of the CO 2 emission per tonne of hot metal is connected to the required amount of reduction agents and the carbon intensity of the applied agents. Current consumption of reducing agents for the blast furnace–converter route in the EU- 15 amounts to 490 – 470 kg/tonne hot metal (HM) and comprise of coke, pulverized coal and a small amount of fuel oil. Among the types of reducing agents applied in practice are natural gas, biomass and secondary fuels, e. g. waste plastics. In the steel industry, there are three potential technological directions for realizing a significant reduction in CO 2 emissions, in a wide manner; design a new process which is essentially more energy efficient and/or carbon-neutral, low carbon reducing agents and fuels, CO 2 capture and storage. As the largest R&D program, called ULCOS (Ultra Low CO 2 Steelmaking) has been running in the EU since 2004.

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} two methods of control over hot blast supply into a blast furnace with constant pressure and constant amount (consumption). The analysis of these two methods was performed {{with the aim of}} determining their influence upon changes in gas pressure in the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>top.</b> The blast furnace was considered as a unity of vessels (furnace hearth, the top) and gas-dynamic resistance (a column of charge materials). A differential equation was obtained, with regard to the dynamic balance of gas flow at the inlet and outlet of the top; the equation relates the pressure and gas consumption at the top to the pressure and hot blast consumption at the inlet and outlet of the furnace and to the resistance of the column of charge materials. The column of charge materials is considered as n-th number of channels through which gas flow inside the furnace moves and which resist to the flow. By the analysis of this equation at steady state (automatic stabilization of gas pressure in the top), the conditions were obtained to be satisfied with the specified value of gas pressure in the top. This value is equal to a half of the sum of the value of hot blast pressure at the inlet into the furnace and the value of pressure inside the collector of blast furnace gas. This conclusion is verified by the operation practice of blast furnaces in Ukraine. While analyzing the second method of controlling the supply of blast supply-stabilization of consumption (amount) of hot blast supplied into the furnace {{it has been shown that}} the method could be realized in condition of stabilization of the amount of blast furnace gas, going out of the furnace. As the resistance of the column of charge materials constantly changes it is necessary to change the hot blast pressure in order to ensure the constant amount of blast, supplied into the furnace. It is often connected with possible substantial pressure fluctuations of hot blast at the inlet of the furnace, which may result in stoppages in the motion of the column of charge materials. Due to it the hot blast pressure stabilization at the inlet of the furnace and the pressure stabilization in the top seem to be the most rational way to control the blast suppl...|$|E
40|$|The {{iron and}} {{steelmaking}} industry {{is among the}} major contributors to the anthropogenic {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} in the world. The rising levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere and the global concern about the greenhouse effect and climate change have brought about considerable investigations on how to reduce the energy intensity and CO 2 emissions of this industrial sector. In this thesis the problem is tackled by mathematical modeling and optimization using three different approaches. The possibility to use biomass in the integrated steel plant, particularly as an auxiliary reductant in the blast furnace, is investigated. By pre-processing the biomass its heating value and carbon content can be increased {{at the same time as}} the oxygen content is decreased. As the compression strength of the preprocessed biomass is lower than that of coke, it is not suitable for replacing a major part of the coke in the blast furnace burden. Therefore the biomass is assumed to be injected at the tuyere level of the blast furnace. Carbon capture and storage is, nowadays, mostly associated with power plants but it can also be used to reduce the CO 2 emissions of an integrated steel plant. In the case of a blast furnace, the effect of CCS can be further increased by recycling the carbon dioxide stripped top gas back into the process. However, this affects the economy of the integrated steel plant, as the amount of top gases available, e. g., for power and heat production is decreased. High quality raw materials are a prerequisite for smooth blast furnace operation. High quality coal is especially needed to produce coke with sufficient properties to ensure proper gas permeability and smooth burden descent. Lower quality coals as well as natural gas, which some countries have in great volumes, can be utilized with various direct and smelting reduction processes. The DRI produced with a direct reduction process can be utilized as a feed material for blast furnace, basic oxygen furnace or electric arc furnace. The liquid hot metal from a smelting reduction process can in turn be used in basic oxygen furnace or electric arc furnace. The unit sizes and investment costs of an alternative ironmaking process are also lower than those of a blast furnace. In this study, the economy of an integrated steel plant is investigated by simulation and optimization. The studied system consists of linearly described unit processes from coke plant to steel making units, with a more detailed thermodynamical model of the blast furnace. The results from the blast furnace operation with biomass injection revealed the importance of proper pre-processing of the raw biomass as the composition of the biomass as well as the heating value and the yield are all affected by the pyrolysis temperature. As for recycling of CO 2 stripped <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>top</b> gas, substantial reductions in the emission rates are achieved if the stripped CO 2 can be stored. However, the optimal recycling degree together with other operation conditions is heavily dependent on the cost structure of CO 2 emissions and stripping/storage. The economical feasibility related to the use of DRI in the blast furnace depends on the price ratio between the DRI pellets and the BF pellets. The high amount of energy needed in the rotary hearth furnace to reduce the iron ore leads to increased CO 2 emissions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the methodology and the preliminary {{results of a}} techno-economic assessment of CCS implementation on the iron and steel sector. The results show that for the short-mid term, a CO 2 avoidance cost of less than 50 €/tonne at a CO 2 avoidance rate of around 50 % are possible by converting the conventional <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> (BF) to <b>Top</b> Gas Recycling <b>Blast</b> <b>Furnace</b> (TGRBF). However, large additional power consumption for CO 2 removal and oxygen generation, and reduction in BF gas export, makes the economic performance of the technology very sensitive to energy prices. Add-on CO 2 capture for conventional BF may achieve similar costs (40 – 50 €/tCO 2 avoided), but the CO 2 avoidance rate will be only about 15 % of the specific CO 2 emissions. For the long term future, although there are large uncertainties, advanced CO 2 capture technologies {{do not seem to}} have significant economic advantages over conventional technologies. The results also indicate that in a carbon-constrained society, when considering new plants, smelting reduction technologies such as the COREX process, may become a strong competitor to conventional <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> based steel making process when equipped with CO 2 capture. Although conventional iron and steel making using BF is expected to dominate the market in the long term, strong need for drastic CO 2 emissions reduction may drive the sector towards large scale implementation of advanced smelting reduction technologies...|$|R

40|$|The life of <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> is {{increase}} due {{to technology}} of furnace cooling very important method for metallurgical industry. <b>Blast</b> <b>furnace</b> mathematical model of stave cooler {{has been developed}} for heat transfer analysis and compare to experimental. Using ANSYS® software calculating the heat transfer and temperature of stave cooler. The result calculating using software ANSYS® and compare with <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> placed in RSP with experimental model. Heat transfer stave cooling of <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> has been done at different temperature from 575 k to 1675 k the result is compare with experimental for better result, in the stave cooling of <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> nitrogen and nano fluid (Al 2 O 3) also as a cooling fluid {{in the place of}} water...|$|R
40|$|Coke plays vital {{roles in}} the {{ironmaking}} <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> process. It is the furnace fuel for the high temperature process and {{the primary source of}} CO gas for the reduction of iron oxide to metal. It is also an important material in maintaining the furnace permeability required for the high production rates 1. The behavior of coke in the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> is related to its hot strength and reactivity 2. Therefore, to understand the coke behavior in the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace,</b> coke reactivity in the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> should be well understood...|$|R
