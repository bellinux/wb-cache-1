5|$|Leonardo {{received}} an informal education in Latin, geometry and mathematics. In later life, Leonardo recorded only two childhood incidents. One, which he {{regarded as an}} omen, was when a kite dropped from the sky and hovered over his cradle, its tail feathers <b>brushing</b> <b>his</b> face. The second occurred while he was exploring in the mountains: he discovered a cave and was both terrified that some great monster might lurk there and driven by curiosity {{to find out what}} was inside.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} five, Burke's local youth {{basketball}} league had {{to change}} its rules {{so that he would}} not keep stealing the ball from the other team. As a result of his prowess, he was not allowed over half court when the other team had the ball. He became Jared Sullinger's best friend in fourth grade, but when his mother was transferred to Atlanta in sixth grade they were separated. The reassignment only lasted one year, however. At the age of nine, Burke's father made him do everything with his left hand, including <b>brushing</b> <b>his</b> teeth and eating dinner, in order to develop his ambidexterity.|$|E
25|$|The area of Andrea Dorias hull where Stockholms bow {{penetrated}} encompassed five passenger decks. On {{the uppermost}} of these decks, the Upper Deck, {{at least eight}} first class cabins were destroyed. In all, six first class passengers lost their lives. In cabin 46, Colonel Walter Carlin {{had been in the}} bathroom <b>brushing</b> <b>his</b> teeth {{at the time of the}} collision and miraculously survived, while his wife Jeanette was killed. In direct line of Stockholms bow on the upper deck were cabins 52 and 54, which were occupied by Camille Cianfarra, a longtime foreign correspondent for The New York Times, his wife Jane, their eight-year-old daughter Joan and 14-year-old Linda Morgan, Jane's daughter from her previous marriage to American journalist Edward P. Morgan. Joan was killed instantly, while Camille died from severe injuries moments after the collision. Jane was seriously injured, but was rescued by some other passengers, among them Dr. Thure Peterson, who had been next door in cabin 56. He sustained only minor injuries, while his wife Martha was gravely wounded and was trapped along with Jane Cianfarra. After a long struggle to free her, largely on the part of her husband, Martha succumbed to her injuries a few hours after the collision. One deck below on the Foyer Deck, near the first class entrance, Ferdinand Melly Thieriot, circulation director of The San Francisco Chronicle, along with his wife Frances, were killed, as their suite was in direct line of the Stockholms bow. Their 13-year-old son Peter, who occupied a cabin further down the corridor, survived.|$|E

500|$|Barrett had one noted {{reunion with}} the members of Pink Floyd, in 1975 during the {{recording}} sessions for Wish You Were Here. He attended the Abbey Road session unannounced, and watched the band working on the final mix of [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" [...] — a song that happened to be about him. By that time, the 29-year-old Barrett had become quite overweight, had shaved off all of his hair (including his eyebrows), and his former bandmates did not initially recognise him. Barrett's behaviour at the session was erratic; he spent part of the session <b>brushing</b> <b>his</b> teeth. Roger Waters finally managed to ask him what he thought of the song and he simply said that it [...] "sounds a bit old". He briefly attended the reception for Gilmour's wedding to Ginger that immediately followed the recording sessions; however, he left early without exchanging goodbyes with the newlyweds.|$|E
500|$|Reasonable Doubt was {{recorded}} at D Studios and mixed at Platinum Island, however, its beats were formed elsewhere. [...] "Can't Knock the Hustle" [...] {{was produced by}} Knobody at his mother's home in 1994, while the vocals were recorded on tour at a studio in Tampa Florida named Progressive Music with Mary J Blige. Ski produced [...] "Feelin' It" [...] and [...] "Politics as Usual" [...] while recording with Camp Lo. The recording sessions were often competitive; Ski and Clark Kent created similar beats for [...] "Politics as Usual", but Ski submitted his to Jay-Z first causing his {{to appear on the}} album. [...] "Brooklyn's Finest" [...] was a competitive, though friendly battle between Jay-Z and The Notorious B.I.G. in which Jay-Z tried proving that he is of Biggie's caliber, while Biggie tried <b>brushing</b> <b>his</b> rhymes off as insignificant. Although the rappers had already met on the set for the [...] "Dead Presidents" [...] music video, they discovered that neither wrote down their rhymes while recording. The recording of [...] "Brooklyn's Finest" [...] spanned two months and moved from D Studios to Giant Studios where the Clark Kent-sung chorus {{was recorded}}.|$|E
500|$|Mayor McDaniels {{decides that}} {{anything}} offensive to anyone {{will be removed}} from the Christmas celebrations, including Santa Claus, Christmas trees, wreaths, fairy lights, candy canes, mistletoe and the Star of Bethlehem. Kyle once again tries to suggest that they use Mr. Hankey as a non-religious Christmas icon since he does not discriminate against anyone. At home, Kyle is scolded by his parents for believing in Mr. Hankey. While Kyle is <b>brushing</b> <b>his</b> teeth, Mr. Hankey comes out of the toilet, spreading feces stains everywhere he goes, prompting Kyle's parents to blame Kyle for the mess. Kyle decides he will bring Mr. Hankey to school to prove he is real, but this only causes more problems as Mr. Hankey disguises himself as an unadorned, dried-out piece of feces when he is around people who do not believe in him, leading Cartman to ask if carrying around boxes with feces in them is some kind of Jewish tradition. Mr. Hankey leaps at Cartman's face as he sings [...] "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch" [...] in D Minor, and Kyle is blamed. He is sent to talk to guidance counselor, Mr. Mackey, but Kyle only gets into further trouble when Mr. Hankey takes a bath in Mr. Mackey's coffee. Cartman, Stan and Kenny believe Kyle is insane and check him into a mental institution.|$|E

500|$|After UB-14s repairs were completed, she {{continued}} on to Constantinople and, from there, began a patrol in the Black Sea on 3 October. During this patrol, von Heimburg torpedoed the 474-ton Russian steamer Katja about [...] northwest of Sevastopol on the 7th, and Apscheron, a Belgian steamer expropriated by the Imperial Russian Navy, [...] south of Cape Chersonesos on the 8th. After {{her return to}} Constantinople on the 19th, UB-14 was prepared for another patrol in the Black Sea. Just before her scheduled departure, however, the U-boat's destination was changed from the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara and von Heimburg and UB-14 headed south on 5 November. While UB-14 had been in port on 30 November, Turkish forces had captured the [...] before the submarine {{or any of the}} confidential papers on board could be destroyed. When Turquoise was caught, her commander had not signaled her predicament to anyone, so a scheduled rendezvous with the British submarine —as far as anyone other than Turquoise or the Germans and Turks knew—was still on. UB-14 had been sent to keep the rendezvous, reportedly {{going so far as to}} radio messages in the latest British code. Upon arriving at the designated location, UB-14 surfaced and fired a torpedo at E20 from a distance of [...] Only when E20s crew saw the torpedo did they realize something was amiss, but it was too late to avoid the weapon. The torpedo hit E20s conning tower and sank the submarine with the loss of 21 men. UB-14 rescued nine men, including E20s captain who, reportedly, had been <b>brushing</b> <b>his</b> teeth at the time of the attack.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} continuity, events in {{different}} episodes contradict each other, {{as there is}} a loose sense of canon. One such example is in [...] "The Other Cousin" [...] and [...] "N.R.A.y RAY", in which Toot is pictured with a penis, something that is not consistent with other episodes. Another is Foxxy's various and contradictory stories about her son Timmy (one involves selling him on the black market, another involves her accidentally shooting him after believing him to be rabid, when he was really just <b>brushing</b> <b>his</b> teeth). Plots and gags are often used that do not make any type of internal sense, but are used as one-off jokes, as when Foxxy, who is in her twenties, is said to have a teenage grandson. Some episodes begin with a fake recap of events supposed to have happened in a (non-existent) previous episode. According to executive producer Bill Freiberger, [...] "Very little on Drawn Together can be considered canon. If you try to find continuity on this show you'll drive yourself nuts. The only thing that's consistent is we try to make the show as funny as possible. And we'd never let a little thing like continuity {{get in the way of}} that." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was brought}} back to the main roster of the now renamed World Wrestling Entertainment in March and placed on the Raw [...] "brand". There, he turned face and was given a gimmick that saw him {{proclaim}} that he was [...] "Just a Regular Guy", for which he was featured in vignettes and backstage segments showing him in normal situations that were then augmented by [...] "disgusting" [...] antics such as <b>brushing</b> <b>his</b> teeth and his dogs teeth with the same brush and eating food from the floor. However, this angle was short-lived. He soon reverted to his [...] "Innovator of Violence" [...] gimmick in the summer and amassed fourteen reigns as Hardcore Champion. During this time, he was the final person to hold it before it became unified with the Intercontinental Championship in a match with Rob Van Dam at Madison Square Garden. After losing the Hardcore Championship, Dreamer renewed his feud with Raven, defeating him in a Loser Leaves Raw match on June 24 to send him to Raw's sister show, Heat. [...] Dreamer (with a variety of partners) would feud in the fall with Lance Storm and William Regal as he sought revenge for his jaw being broken. [...] Dreamer would make his Royal Rumble debut in 2003, bringing weapons with him and breaking Bill DeMott's hand during the match.|$|E

2500|$|Puyi {{had never}} brushed his teeth or tied his own {{shoelaces}} {{once in his}} life, and {{now for the first}} time was forced to perform the simple tasks that always had been done for him, which he found very difficult to do. The prisoners often laughed how Puyi struggled with even <b>brushing</b> <b>his</b> teeth. Much of Puyi's [...] "remodeling" [...] consisted of attending [...] "Marxist-Leninist-Maoist discussion groups" [...] where the prisoners would discuss their lives before being imprisoned for hours on end. As part of his [...] "remodeling", Puyi was confronted with ordinary people who had suffered under the [...] "Empire of Manchukuo", including those who had fought in the Communist resistance, both to prove to him that resistance to the Japanese had been possible and to show him what he had presided over. When Puyi protested to Jin that it had been impossible to resist Japan and there was nothing he could have done, Ji confronted him with people who had fought in the resistance and had been tortured while Ji asked him why ordinary people in Manchukuo resisted while an emperor did nothing. As part of confronting war crimes, Puyi had to attend lectures where a former Japanese civil servant spoke about the exploitation of Manchukuo while a former officer in the Kempeitai talked about how he rounded up people for slave labor and ordered mass executions. At one point, Puyi was taken to Harbin and Pingfang to see where the infamous Unit 731, the chemical and biological warfare unit in the Japanese Army had conducted gruesome experiments on people. Puyi noted in shame and horror: [...] "All the atrocities had been carried out in my name". Puyi by the mid-1950s was overwhelmed with guilt and often told Jin that he felt utterly worthless to the point that he considered suicide. Puyi was told by Jin to express his guilt in writing, which Puyi later recalled he felt [...] "that I was up against an irresistible force that would not rest until it found out everything". Sometimes, Puyi was taken out for tours of the countryside of Manchuria, where he met a farmer's wife whose family had been evicted to make way for Japanese settlers and had almost starved to death while working as a slave in one of Manchukuo's factories. When Puyi asked for her forgiveness, she told him [...] "It's all over now, let's not talk about it", causing him to break down in tears. At another meeting, a woman described the mass execution of people from her village by the Japanese Army, and then declared that she did not hate the Japanese and those who had served them as she retained her faith in humanity, which greatly moved Puyi. On another occasion, Ji confronted Puyi with his former concubine Li in meetings in his office, where she attacked him for seeing her only as a sex object, and saying she was now pregnant by a man who loved her.|$|E
