Speakers at the ceremony, {{including}} California Governor Pete Wilson, Kansas senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole,</b> <b>and</b> the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham, eulogized the former First Lady. In addition to her husband and immediate family, former presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford and their wives, Nancy and Betty, were also in attendance. Lady Bird Johnson was unable to attend because she was in the hospital recovering from a stroke, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did not attend either. President Nixon sobbed openly, profusely, and at times uncontrollably during the ceremony. It was a rare display of emotion from the former president, and Helen McCain Smith said that she had never seen him more distraught.|$|E

25|$|He {{is active}} in the Republican Party and was a {{delegate}} to both the 2000 and 1996 National conventions. In 1996 he served on the Republican National Convention Platform Committee. He has been an advisor and consultant to the presidential campaigns of George W. Bush, <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> <b>and</b> Steve Forbes for President campaigns.

25|$|Watts ran for Congress in 1994 {{to succeed}} Dave McCurdy, who had {{announced}} his retirement from the House of Representatives {{to run for the}} Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending. After a hard-fought primary campaign against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49percent to Apple's 48percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston. Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92percent name recognition in one poll. Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole,</b> <b>and</b> Minority Whip Newt Gingrich and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks. Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win. On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52percent of the vote as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction. He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House. Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.|$|E

500|$|McCain became {{chairman}} of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 1995, and would hold that position into 1997. [...] McCain's visibility was increased by the 1995 publication of Robert Timberg's well-received The Nightingale's Song, a joint biography of five graduates from the Naval Academy who had served in Vietnam and whose subsequent public fame and problems illuminated the role of Vietnam and the military in American life. [...] At {{the start of the}} 1996 presidential election, McCain served as national campaign chairman for the highly unsuccessful Republican nomination effort of Texas Senator Phil Gramm. [...] After Gramm dropped out, McCain endorsed eventual nominee Senate Majority Leader <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole,</b> <b>and</b> was again on the short list of possible vice-presidential picks. [...] McCain formed a close bond with Dole, based in part on their shared near-death war experiences; he nominated Dole at the 1996 Republican National Convention and was a key friend and advisor to Dole throughout his ultimately losing general election campaign.|$|E
500|$|Kemp {{delivered}} speeches {{at several}} Republican National Conventions. He addressed the convention on July 15 at the 1980 Republican National Convention in Detroit, Michigan and on August 21 at the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas. [...] During the 1984 Convention, with Trent Lott as Republican Party Platform Committee chairman, Congressmen Kemp and Newt Gingrich claimed {{control of the}} party platform {{to the consternation of}} G.O.P. senators <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> <b>and</b> Howard Baker. Kemp's official role was as the chairman of the platform subcommittee on foreign policy. [...] However, the three platform planks that he proposed involved tax hikes, the gold standard {{and the role of the}} Federal Reserve. Despite Kemp's official role, his real influence as an author was on the grammatical structure of the plank on tax hikes. By 1985, Kemp was a leading contender for the 1988 Presidential nomination. He also delivered remarks on free enterprise zones at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston, Texas. Despite efforts and considerations of expanding his political domain, Kemp never held a fundraiser outside of his suburban Western New York district until well into his eighth term in Congress.|$|E

500|$|After the election, Perot {{continued}} to work with [...] "United We Stand", and focused his efforts to defeat the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In 1993, {{he was involved in}} a highly publicized debate with Vice President Al Gore on Larry King Live over NAFTA. Perot formed the Reform Party of the United States of America in 1995, and ran for president under the party's banner the following year. During the election, he failed to appear in the presidential debates, and finished in third place with about 8% of the vote, behind Republican nominee <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> <b>and</b> President Bill Clinton. The Reform Party's candidate, former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, was elected as Governor of Minnesota in 1998, which was connected to Perot's performance in the presidential elections. His focus on a balanced budget during his campaigns is speculated to have brought the issue to the forefront, enabling the surplus of the late 1990s. [...] Perot declined to run in the 2000 presidential election, and endorsed eventual winner Republican Governor George W. Bush of Texas. In 2008, he endorsed Republican Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts for the presidency, and stated [...] "the situation in 1992 was not nearly as bad as it is now... {{if ever there was a}} time when it was necessary to put our house in order, it is now." [...] The members of the populist Tea Party movement have been compared to Perot advocates, for their support of a balanced budget.|$|E
500|$|Biden became {{interested}} in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991. [...] Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden {{was among the first to}} call for the [...] "lift and strike" [...] policy of lifting the arms embargo, training Bosnian Muslims and supporting them with NATO air strikes, and investigating war crimes. [...] Both the George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement. [...] In April 1993, Biden spent a week in the Balkans and held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević. [...] Biden related that he told Milošević, [...] "I think you're a damn war criminal and you should be tried as one." [...] Biden wrote an amendment in 1992 to compel the Bush administration to arm the Bosnians, but deferred in 1994 to a somewhat softer stance preferred by the Clinton administration, before signing on the following year to a stronger measure sponsored by <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> <b>and</b> Joe Lieberman. The engagement led to a successful NATO peacekeeping effort. [...] Biden has called his role in affecting Balkans policy in the mid-1990s his [...] "proudest moment in public life" [...] that related to foreign policy. [...] In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Biden supported the NATO bombing campaign against Serbia and Montenegro, and co-sponsored with his friend John McCain the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on President Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milosevic over Serbian actions in Kosovo. [...] In 1998, Congressional Quarterly named Biden one of [...] "Twelve Who Made a Difference" [...] for playing a lead role in several foreign policy matters, including NATO enlargement and the successful passage of bills to streamline foreign affairs agencies and punish religious persecution overseas.|$|E

2500|$|A similar {{concept was}} revived briefly in March 2003, this time {{featuring}} <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> <b>and</b> Bill Clinton, former {{opponents in the}} 1996 presidential election. The pair agreed to do ten segments, called [...] "Clinton/Dole" [...] and [...] "Dole/Clinton" [...] in alternating weeks, but did not continue into the 2003–04 fall television season.

Even later, Jones III shook Bush's hand and thanked him for being a good president. In the 1990s, other Republicans such as Dan Quayle, Pat Buchanan, Phil Gramm, <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole,</b> <b>and</b> Alan Keyes also spoke at BJU. Democrats were rarely invited {{to speak at the}} university, in part because they took political and social positions (especially support for abortion rights) opposed by the Religious Right.|$|E
2500|$|Evans {{was elected}} to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1976, {{defeating}} Democrat Samuel L. Shipley. He won election three times in all, also defeating Democrats Gary E.

He came to the U.S. Congress already a friend of U.S. Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole,</b> <b>and</b> later became a friend of United States President Ronald Reagan. He served on the U.S. House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs and the U.S House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. Passionate about the environment, Evans co-authored the Coastal Barrier Resources Act and the Alaska Wilderness Preservation Act. [...] He also co authored the Evans-Tsongas Act.
