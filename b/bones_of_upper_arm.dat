50|$|Pectoralis major is a thick, fan-shaped muscle, {{which makes}} {{up the bulk of}} the chest muscle. It lies under the breast. It serves to flex, extend, and rotate the humerus, the long <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> the <b>upper</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R

5000|$|When the arm is extended, {{with the}} palm facing forward or up, the <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> the <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> (humerus) and forearm (radius and ulna) are not {{perfectly}} aligned.

5000|$|The medial {{epicondyle}} of the humerus is an epicondyle <b>of</b> the humerus <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> the <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> in humans. It {{is larger}} and more prominent than the lateral epicondyle and is directed slightly more posteriorly in the anatomical position. In birds, where the arm is somewhat rotated compared to other tetrapods, {{it is called the}} ventral epicondyle of the humerus. In comparative anatomy, the more neutral term entepicondyle is used.|$|R
5000|$|This nerve {{can cause}} an {{electric}} shock-like sensation by striking the medial epicondyle of the humerus from posteriorly, or inferiorly with the elbow flexed. The ulnar nerve is trapped between {{the bone and}} the overlying skin at this point. This is {{commonly referred to as}} bumping one's [...] "funny bone". This name is thought to be a pun, based on the sound resemblance between the name <b>of</b> the <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> the <b>upper</b> <b>arm,</b> the [...] "humerus" [...] and the word [...] "humorous". Alternatively, according to the Oxford English Dictionary it may refer to [...] "the peculiar sensation experienced when it is struck".|$|R

50|$|A humerus {{fracture}} is a <b>bone</b> fracture <b>of</b> the <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> the <b>upper</b> <b>arm,</b> the humerus. Fractures of the humerus may {{be classified}} by {{the location of}} the fracture and divided into fractures of the proximal region, which is near the shoulder, the middle region, which is the shaft of the humerus, and the distal region, which is near the elbow. These locations can further be divided based on the extent of the fracture and the specific areas of each of the three regions affected. Humerus fractures usually occur after physical trauma, falls, excess physical stress, or pathological conditions. Falls are {{the most common cause of}} proximal and shaft fractures, and those who experience a fracture from a fall usually have an underlying risk factor for bone fracture. Distal fractures occur most frequently in children who experience physical trauma to the elbow area.|$|R
25|$|In women, {{the breasts}} overlay the pectoralis major muscles and usually extend from {{the level of}} the second rib to {{the level of the}} sixth rib in the front of the human rib cage; thus, the breasts cover much of the chest area and the chest walls. At the front of the chest, the breast tissue can extend from the {{clavicle}} (collarbone) to the middle of the sternum (breastbone). At the sides of the chest, the breast tissue can extend into the axilla (armpit), and can reach as far to the back as the latissimus dorsi muscle, extending from the lower back to the humerus bone (the longest <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> the <b>upper</b> <b>arm).</b> As a mammary gland, the breast is composed of differing layers of tissue, predominantly two types: adipose tissue; and glandular tissue, which affects the lactation functions of the breasts.|$|R
5000|$|In vertebrates, {{the various}} cells of blood {{are made in}} the bone marrow in a process called hematopoiesis, which {{includes}} erythropoiesis, the production of red blood cells; and myelopoiesis, the production of white blood cells and platelets. During childhood, almost every human bone produces red blood cells; as adults, red blood cell production is limited to the larger bones: the bodies of the vertebrae, the breastbone (sternum), the ribcage, the pelvic bones, and the <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> the <b>upper</b> <b>arms</b> and legs. In addition, during childhood, the thymus gland, found in the mediastinum, is an important source of T lymphocytes. [...] There are recent reports that the lungs may also be the site of hematopoiesis.The proteinaceous component of blood (including clotting proteins) is produced predominantly by the liver, while hormones are produced by the endocrine glands and the watery fraction is regulated by the hypothalamus and maintained by the kidney.|$|R
60|$|Stephen {{suggested}} {{that it should be}} skinned, and although I saw little prospect of our being able to carry away the hide, I assented and helped in the operation on the mere chance of saving so great a curiosity. Also, although Brother John was restless and murmured something about wasting time, I thought it necessary that we should have a rest after our fearful anxieties and still more fearful encounter with this consecrated monster. So we set to work, {{and as a result of}} more than an hour's toil, dragged off the hide, which was so tough and thick that, as we found, the copper spears had scarcely penetrated to the flesh. The bullet that I had put into it on the previous night struck, we discovered, upon the <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> the <b>upper</b> <b>arm,</b> which it shattered sufficiently to render that limb useless, if it did not break it altogether. This, indeed, was fortunate for us, for had the creature retained both its arms uninjured, it would certainly have killed more of us in its attack. We were saved only by the fact that when it was hugging Jerry it had no limb left with which it could strike, and luckily did not succeed in its attempts to get hold with its tremendous jaws that had nipped off the Kalubi's hand as easily as a pair of scissors severs the stalk of a flower.|$|R
50|$|When camels {{have only}} two toes present, the claws are {{transformed}} into nails (while both are made of keratin, claws are curved and pointed while nails are flat and dull). These claws consist of three parts: the plate (top and sides), the sole (bottom), and the bale (rear). In general, the claws of the forelegs are wider and blunter {{than those of the}} hind legs, and the gape is farther apart. Aside from camels, all even-toed ungulates put {{just the tip of the}} foremost phalanx on the ground.In even-toed ungulates, the <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> the stylopodium (<b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> or thigh bone) and zygopodiums (tibia and fibula) are usually elongated. The muscles of the limbs are predominantly localized, which ensures that artiodactyls often have very slender legs. A clavicle is never present, and the scapula is very agile and swings back and forth for added mobility when running. The special construction of the legs causes the legs to be unable to rotate, which allows for greater stability when running at high speeds. In addition, many smaller artiodactyls have a very flexible body, contributing to their speed by increasing their stride length.|$|R

40|$|The {{recently}} prevailing {{trend in}} our country is {{the adoption of the}} girth <b>of</b> <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> as a measure of the nutritional condition. The reason is that the girth <b>of</b> <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> exactly indicates the state <b>of</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> having plenty <b>of</b> fat, muscles and blood of which the girth <b>of</b> <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> is consisted. The quantity of subcutaneous fat is usually resumed by its thickness, but Oeder's method is not very exact in measuring it. Electromyography has given us more satisfactory results. By this method we measured the thickness of subcutaneous fat tissues on <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> and abdomen, and got the correlation between the thickness and the girth <b>of</b> <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> or Vervaeck index; we examined the correlation between the girth <b>of</b> <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> and the Schlomka index, the strength of back muscles and the gripe strength, which indicate musclar growth. For this purpose, the measurements of standing hight, weight, girth of chest and sitting hight of 24 male students were carried out. As a result we observed that the girth <b>of</b> <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> is not correlated with the thickness of subcutaneous fat but with musclar growth only, and also that the thickness of subcutaneous fat tissues on <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> and abdomen is not correlated with weight and Vervaeck index at all, and that the difference between the thickness of subcutaneous fat tissues on <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> and that on abdomen is negatively correlated to the muscle growth. Consequently, supposing that subcutaneous fat is exactly parallel with the total quantity of body fat, and also from the view point that quantity of body fat is not negligible for the determination of nutritional condition, the girthof <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> and Vervaeck index should not be adopted as a measure of nutritional condition. In order to obtain the final conclusion of this, however, we have to ascertain if the subcutaneous quantity is in parallel with total quantity of body fat, and the subcutaneous fat quantity is presumed by its thickness...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether local {{application}} of ice packs had positive effects on recovery from eccentric contraction-induced skeletal muscle injury and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Three male and 8 female healthy university students served as subjects. The subjects performed 20 eccentric contractions of elbow flexor muscles on 2 occasions, one with application of ice packs on the muscles immediately after eccentric actions (experimental trial) and the other without ice pack modality (control trial). Maximal isometric strength, relaxed <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> circumference, flexed elbow angle and perceived muscle soreness were measured before, immediately after eccentric actions, after 30 min-long ice pack application, and 1 day after and 2 days after eccentric actions. Plasma creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity was determined before, 1 day after and 2 days after eccentric actions. Repeated measure ANOVA showed significant cold treatment effect and treatment-time interaction were found for girth <b>of</b> <b>upper</b> <b>arm.</b> Girth <b>of</b> <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> was significantly lower in the experimental trial than in the control trial. Moreover, ice pack treatment decreased the girth <b>of</b> <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> to control values immediately after treatment.
