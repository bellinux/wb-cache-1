40|$|OBJECTIVE: To find a {{correlation}} between the cross-over ratio of the cross-over sign on conventional anteroposterior (AP) pelvic radiographs and retroversion measurements ('roof-edge angle' and 'equatorial-edge angle) on computed tomography (CT) scans. This would facilitate {{the interpretation of the}} cross-over sign regarding the amount of acetabular retroversion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Correctly projected AP pelvic radiographs (2, 925 hips) were examined for the presence of the cross-over sign (COS), and the overlap ratio of the COS was measured. On CT scans of the same patients the 'roof-edge angle' (RE angle) and the 'equatorial-edge angle' (EE angle) were also calculated. RESULTS: A statistically significant but only weak relationship could be found <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>overlap</b> ratio of the COS and the 'roof-edge angle' (P < 0. 0001; correlation coefficient - 0. 486) and between this ratio and the 'equatorial-edge angle' (P < 0. 0001; correlation coefficient - 0. 395). CONCLUSION: A relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>overlap</b> ratio and orientation measurements on CT scans could be found, but it was less strong than expected...|$|E

40|$|The {{collision}} of two plasma clouds {{at a speed}} that exceeds the ion acoustic speed can result {{in the formation of}} shocks. This phenomenon is observed not only in astrophysical scenarios such as the propagation of supernova remnant (SNR) blast shells into the interstellar medium, but also in laboratory-based laser-plasma experiments. These experiments and supporting simulations are thus seen as an attractive platform for the small-scale reproduction and study of astrophysical shocks in the laboratory. We model two plasma clouds, which consist of electrons and ions, with a 2 D PIC simulation. The ion temperatures of both clouds differ by a factor of 10. Both clouds collide at a speed, which is realistic for laboratory studies and for SNR shocks in their late evolution phase like that of RCW 86. A magnetic field, which is orthogonal to the simulation plane, has a strength that is comparable to that at SNR shocks. A forward shock forms <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>overlap</b> layer of both plasma clouds and the cloud with the cooler ions. A large-amplitude ion acoustic wave is observed <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>overlap</b> layer and the cloud with the hotter ions. It does not steepen into a reverse shock, because its speed is below the ion acoustic speed. A gradient of the magnetic field amplitude builds up close to the forward shock as it compresses the magnetic field. This gradient gives rise to an electron drift that is fast enough to trigger an instability. Electrostatic ion acoustic wave turbulence develops ahead of the shock. It widens its transition layer and thermalizes the ions, but the forward shock remains intact. Comment: Accepted for publication in the New Journal of Physic...|$|E

By comparing the NEGF based DMM conductance and range of conductance while altering the mass and bonding strength, we show that DMM provides an upper bound for elastic transport in this dimensionally mismatched system. We thus have a prescription to enhance the thermal conductance of systems at low temperatures or at low dimensions where inelastic scattering is considerably suppressed...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} clustering noisy finite-length observations of stationary ergodic random processes according to their generative models without prior knowledge of the model statistics {{and the number of}} generative models. Two algorithms, both using the $L^ 1 $-distance between estimated power spectral densities (PSDs) as a measure of dissimilarity, are analyzed. The first one, termed nearest neighbor process clustering (NNPC), relies on partitioning the nearest neighbor graph of the observations via spectral clustering. The second algorithm, simply referred to as $k$-means (KM), consists of a single $k$-means iteration with farthest point initialization and was considered before in the literature, albeit with a different dissimilarity measure. We prove that both algorithms succeed with high probability in the presence of noise and missing entries, and even when the generative process PSDs overlap significantly, all provided that the observation length is sufficiently large. Our results quantify the tradeoff <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>overlap</b> of the generative process PSDs, the observation length, the fraction of missing entries, and the noise variance.

40|$|Considering the {{importance}} of scientific interactions, understanding the principles that govern fruitful scientific research is crucial to policy makers and scientists alike. The outcome of an interaction is {{to a large extent}} dependent on the balancing of contradicting motivations accompanying the establishment of collaborations. Here, we assembled a dataset of nearly 20, 000 publications authored by researchers affiliated with ten top universities. Based on this data collection, we estimated the extent of different interaction types between pairwise combinations of researchers. We explored the interplay <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>overlap</b> in scientific interests and the tendency to collaborate, and associated these estimates with measures of scientific quality and social accessibility aiming at studying the typical resulting gain of different interaction patterns. Our results show that scientists tend to collaborate more often with colleagues with whom they share moderate to high levels of mutual interests and knowledge while cooperative tendency declines at higher levels of research-interest overlap, suggesting fierce competition, and at the lower levels, suggesting communication gaps. Whereas the relative number of alliances dramatically differs across a gradient of research overlap, the scientific impact of the resulting articles remains similar. When considering social accessibility, we find that though collaborations between remote researchers are relatively rare, their quality is significantly higher than studies produced by close-circle scientists. Since current collaboration patterns do not necessarily overlap with gaining optimal scientific quality, these findings should encourage scientists to reconsider current collaboration strategies...|$|E

Multiplex networks, in particular, provide the theoretical framework within network science {{that allows us to}} mathematically describe the rich structure of interactions characterizing human societies. While research has shown that multiplex networks may enhance the resilience of cooperation, the interplay <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>overlap</b> {{in the structure of the}} layers and the control parameters of the corresponding games has not yet been investigated. With this aim, we consider here the public goods game on a multiplex network, and we unveil the role of the number of layers and the overlap of links, as well as the impact of different synergy factors in different layers, on the onset of cooperation. We show that enhanced public cooperation emerges only when a significant edge overlap is combined with at least one layer being able to sustain some cooperation by means of a sufficiently high synergy factor. In the absence of either of these conditions, the evolution of cooperation in multiplex networks is determined by the bounds of traditional network reciprocity with no enhanced resilience. These results caution against overly optimistic predictions that the presence of multiple social domains may in itself promote cooperation, and they help us better understand the complexity behind prosocial behavior in layered social systems.

40|$|When visual sensor {{networks}} {{are composed of}} cameras which can adjust the zoom factor of their own lens, one must determine the optimal zoom levels for the cameras, for a given task. This gives rise to an important trade-off <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>overlap</b> of the different cameras’ fields of view, providing redundancy, and image quality. In an object tracking task, having multiple cameras observe the same area allows for quicker recovery, when a camera fails. In contrast having narrow zooms allow for a higher pixel count on regions of interest, leading to increased tracking confidence. In this paper we propose an approach for the self-organisation of redundancy in a distributed visual sensor network, based on decentralised multi-objective online learning using only local information to approximate the global state. We explore the impact of different zoom levels on these trade-offs, when tasking omnidirectional cameras, having perfect 360 -degree view, with keeping track of a varying number of moving objects. We further show how employing decentralised reinforcement learning enables zoom configurations to be achieved dynamically at runtime according to an operator’s preference for maximising either the proportion of objects tracked, confidence associated with tracking, or redundancy in expectation of camera failure. We show that explicitly taking account {{of the level of}} overlap, even based only on local knowledge, improves resilience when cameras fail.
