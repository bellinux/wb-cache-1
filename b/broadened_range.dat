40|$|Nicolas Poussin's two Self-Portraits, {{painted in}} 1649 and 1650, {{have been the}} subject of countless art-historical investigations, but remain only incompletely understood. This study {{attempts}} to draw the meanings of the self-images into clearer focus. To this end, the relationships between Poussin and the eventual recipients of the two portraits, Jean Pointel and Paul Freart, Sieur de Chantelou, are examined more probingly and are positioned centrally in the analysis of the works. A careful exploration of the web of associations among the three men reveals that Poussin's caution in dealing with Chantelou, his often jealous and emotional patron, was a factor of great consequence to the development of the Self-Portraits. Bearing this in mind, both Poussin's letters and the scholarly accounts which accept his written statements at face value, may be approached with a more critical eye. This practice, in turn, leads to a <b>broadened</b> <b>range</b> of possibilities for the interpretation of the two Self-Portraits, and to a greater appreciation of the extent to which Poussin's creations were affected by human dynamics...|$|E

I draw on a case study of a multilingual language learner, Paweni, a Thai immigrant, describing how she and her peers negotiated cultural and linguistic difference.

Moreover it shows public acceptance and new user-friendly capture devices are developed and used in a <b>broadened</b> <b>range</b> of applications. Currently, iris recognition systems work well with frontal iris images from cooperative users. Nonideal iris images are still a challenge for iris recognition and can significantly affect the accuracy of iris recognition systems. In this paper, we propose a method to correct off-angle iris image. Taking into account the eye morphology and the reflectance properties of the external transparent layers, we can evaluate the distorting effect that is present in the acquired image. The correction algorithm proposed includes a first modeling phase of the human eye, a segmentation of the acquired image, and a simulation phase where the acquisition geometry is reproduced and the distortions are evaluated. Finally we obtain an image which does not contain the distorting effects due to jumps in the refractive index. We show how this correction process reduce the intra-class variations for off-angle iris images...|$|E

40|$|Linear sp-carbon polyynes {{are ideal}} {{molecules}} for the direct {{investigation of the}} physical properties of one-dimensional systems. Traditionally, the main obstacle {{to the study of}} these systems has been their instability under normal laboratory conditions. Thanks to improved chemical syntheses, a <b>broadened</b> <b>range</b> of polyynes is now available for study, including the hydrocarbon series end capped with adamantyl groups, Ad[n]. In this work, the quantitative Raman spectroscopic analysis is reported for each member of this homologous series. The Raman scattering intensities corresponding to the major features of the polyyne segment (i. e. the effective conjugation coordinate or Я lines) are then used to evaluate the nonlinear optical (NLO) behavior via determination of the vibrational contribution to the second hyperpolarizability (gamma_vib). This study shows that gamma_vib values as a function of length are of the same order of magnitude as those arising from the electronic contribution to the molecular second hyperpolarizability, gamma_ele, as reported for triisopropylsilyl polyynes, TIPS[n], using the differential optical Kerr effect technique. The nonlinear response for Ad[n] polyynes, supported by the analogous response for TIPS[n] polyynes, confirms that linear sp-carbon molecules have large second hyperpolarizabilities that show a power-law increase in gamma-values versus length that is larger than other known p-conjugated systems, such as polyenes. Furthermore, the NLO response of polyynes versus length approaches the theoretical limit described by Kuzyk more closely than other conjugated organic oligomers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Aim: To {{determine}} if acetazolamide, an effective treatment for certain inherited channelopathies, has therapeutic effects on infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) in a well-studied subject, {{compare them to}} other therapies in the same subject and to tenotomy and reattachment (T&R) in other subjects. Methods: Eye-movement data were taken using a high-speed digital video recording system. Nystagmus waveforms were analyzed by applying an eXpanded Nystagmus Acuity Function (NAFX) at different gaze angles and determining the Longest Foveation Domain (LFD). Results: Acetazolamide improved foveation by both a 59. 7 % increase in the peak value of the NAFX function (from 0. 395 to 0. 580) and a 70 % broadening of the NAFX vs Gaze Angle curve (the LFD increased from 20 ° to 34 °). The resulting U-shaped improvement in the percent NAFX vs Gaze Angle curve, varied from ~ 60 % near the NAFX peak to over 1000 % laterally. The therapeutic improvements in NAFX from acetazolamide (similar to T&R) were intermediate between those of soft contact lenses and convergence, the latter was best; for LFD improvements, acetazolamide and contact lenses were equivalent and less effective than convergence. Computer simulations suggested that damping the central oscillation driving INS was insufficient to produce the foveation improvements and increased NAFX values. Conclusion: Acetazolamide resulted in improved-foveation INS waveforms over a <b>broadened</b> <b>range</b> of gaze angles, probably acting at more than one site.

40|$|A vast {{cross-section}} of transportation, manufacturing, consumer product, and medical technologies {{rely heavily on}} actuation. Accordingly, progress in these industries is often strongly coupled {{to the advancement of}} actuation technologies. As the field of actuation continues to evolve, smart materials show significant promise for satisfying the growing needs of industry. In particular, shape memory alloy (SMA) wire actuators present an opportunity for low-cost, high performance actuation, but until now, they have been limited or restricted from use in many otherwise suitable applications by the difficulty in packaging the SMA wires within tight or unusually shaped form constraints. To address this packaging problem, SMA wires can be spool-packaged by wrapping around mandrels to make the actuator more compact or by redirecting around multiple mandrels to customize SMA wire pathways to unusual form factors. The goal of this dissertation is to develop the scientific knowledge base for spooled packaging of low-cost SMA wire actuators that enables high, predictable performance within compact, customizable form factors. In developing the scientific knowledge base, this dissertation defines a systematic general representation of single and multiple mandrel spool-packaged SMA actuators and provides tools for their analysis, understanding, and synthesis. A quasi-static analytical model distills the underlying mechanics down to the three effects of friction, bending, and binding, which enables prediction of the behavior of generic spool-packaged SMA actuators with specifiable geometric, loading, frictional, and SMA material parameters. An extensive experimental and simulation-based parameter study establishes the necessary understanding of how primary design tradeoffs between performance, packaging, and cost are governed by the underlying mechanics of spooled actuators. A design methodology outlines a systematic approach to synthesizing high performance SMA wire actuators with mitigated material, power, and packaging costs and compact, customizable form factors. By examining the multi-faceted connections between performance, packaging, and cost, this dissertation builds a knowledge base that goes beyond implementing SMA actuators for particular applications. Rather, it provides a well-developed strategy for realizing the advantages of SMA actuation for a <b>broadened</b> <b>range</b> of applications, thereby enabling opportunities for new functionality and capabilities in industry...|$|E
