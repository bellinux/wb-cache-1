40|$|Sensory and {{emotional}} profiling by consumers is gathering interest among scientists and companies {{as it could}} help {{to better understand the}} motives for food choice. Although children and teenagers are important food consumer groups, they are underrepresented in sensory research and little is known on how children and teenagers perform on these tasks. Therefore, this study investigates the emotional and sensory profiling of a traditional <b>biscuit</b> <b>product</b> among 122 children and teenagers (10 - 14 years old). The check-all-that-apply (CATA) approach has been applied for conducting the emotional and sensory profiling task using an age-appropriate protocol. Children and teenagers evaluated four different samples (market leader, store brand, small producer, and local bakery) and assessed their overall liking under three conditions: blind, expected (brand logo) and informed. Overall liking differed significantly among the samples and brand information influenced the informed liking scores. Samples were associated with different emotional profiles and sensory attributes by the children and teenagers. Practical applications: This study illustrates the potential of using CATA questions for obtaining emotional connotations and sensory attributes of food products with children and teenagers. Together with the insights regarding their attitudes toward traditional food products and store brands, this could help producers when developing promotion initiatives to bring their traditional food products to a potential market of young consumers. Including both sensory {{and emotional}} measurements yield interesting insights for the product development if companies want to produce products in alignment with the brand message. Further, this study shows that branding influences not only the overall liking but also the sensory perception of the food products. Therefore, this study adds to the discussion on the need and importance of a more realistic product presentation during sensory testing...|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{research}} of applicability of gluten-free flours from cereal crops and from by-products of cereal crop processing - ground crumbs sifted out in a process of flake production from rice, corn and millet during the production of <b>biscuit</b> semi-finished <b>products.</b> Taking into account that viscosity is an important technological characteristic of foam-like biscuit dough, as it determines foam strength and dispersed medium stability, the influence of gluten-free flours on the structural and rheological properties of biscuit dough was studied. It is determined that the substitution of wheat flour for cereal flours leads to viscosity reduction of the dough as a consequence of absence of gluten-forming proteins in them. A comparative analysis of changes in viscous properties of biscuit dough based on flour from flakes crumb while warming it up to 60 °C with dough based on cereal flours and dough based on wheat flour was held. It is shown that the presence of partially gelatinized starch granules in flour from flake crumb, as a result of technological peculiarities of their extraction, promotes greater demonstration of thickening properties already at the initial stage of baking than in cereal flours. This leads to an increase of dough viscosity and formation of desired rheological characteristics, which provide the porous structure of finished products. To provide the high quality of gluten-free <b>biscuit</b> semi-finished <b>products,</b> the recipe composition of gluten-free <b>biscuit</b> semi-finished <b>product,</b> based on flour mixture from millet flakes crumb, corn and rice flour, was optimized by using the method of mathematical design of experiments.  The porosity indicator was chosen as the criteria for the evaluation of influence of proportion of gluten-free flours on the quality of <b>biscuit</b> semi-finished <b>products.</b> The response surfaces of dependency of biscuit porosity from mass ratio of recipe components in the composite mixture were obtained. It was confirmed experimentally that the use of pre-gelatinized acetylated modified starches during the production of gluten-free <b>biscuit</b> semi-finished <b>products,</b> facilitates the stabilization of the structural and rheological properties of foam structure - viscosity growth of biscuit dough because of foam-stabilizing property, which is particular to them.

The aim of this thesis was to produce a shortbread <b>biscuit</b> <b>product</b> containing MGTP and to evaluate its consumer acceptability {{and the effect of}} its consumption on postprandial blood glucose, triglyceride, and satiety responses. In the first instance, the phytochemical composition of the MGTP was determined and compared to green tea extract powder (GTEP), another popular product, which is prepared by solvent extraction. HPLC analysis revealed that MGTP had higher total catechin content and lower caffeine content than GTEP. MGTP was incorporated into shortbread biscuits at 2, 4, 6 g per 100 g of flour. The effect of baking, storage, and the addition of sodium bicarbonate on the catechin stability was evaluated. Percentage of total catechin remaining in biscuits ranged from 81 - 89 % when compared to catechin content in dough. Epimerization of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) to gallocatechin gallate (GCG) occurred during baking. Moreover, over one month storage, epigallocatechin (EGC) loss (30 - 50 % loss) was significant and contributed to the significant loss of total catechins. Next, the sensory evaluation of shortbread biscuits formulated with three levels of MGTP (2, 4, 6 g per 100 g of flour) and three levels of sugar (25, 30, 35 g per 100 g of flour) was conducted through acceptability test with a 9 -hedonic point scale. The biscuits that contained 2 g of MGTP and 25 g of sugar per 100 g of flour showed the highest acceptability, whereas the biscuit that contained 6 g of MGTP and 25 g of sugar per 100 g of flour received the lowest acceptability. The result indicated that consumers preferred the biscuits with low content of MGTP. Finally, a pilot study investigated the effect of MGTP, either incorporated into shortbread biscuits (6 g per 100 g of flour) or consumed as a drink (3 g dissolved in water) with a plain biscuit, on the postprandial glucose, triglyceride and satiety responses in healthy human subjects. The pilot study revealed that among Asian participants, the triglyceride response after consuming biscuits that incorporated with MGTP was significantly lowered, when compared with plain biscuits and plain biscuit with green tea drink meal. The result shows a possibility that a shortbread biscuits’ matrix may enhance the triglyceride lowering effect of MGTP. Moreover, the sensory evaluation result indicated that familiarity of MGTP could increase the acceptability of shortbread biscuits incorporated with MGTP. Hence, this research shows that biscuits with MGTP has a potential to be put in the healthy food market...|$|E
40|$|Support {{from the}} {{national}} extension service CUE: Agricultural extension services have traditionally focussed on crop production methods, for example training farmers in how to boost soil fertility, protect their land from erosion or grow new crop varieties. But for many farmers the difficulties of selling their produce can be even greater than producing {{it in the first}} place; in particular, farmers in remote areas face high transport costs and as a result struggle to compete with those who live close to towns and cities. Communicating with potential buyers can also be difficult; telephone services may be unreliable and travelling to meet buyers can be very time-consuming and costly. How then can farmers overcome these problems? Is there anything that government extension services can do to help them? In Cameroon the answer is ?Yes?. Martha Chindong spoke to Basaguel Samuel, an extension worker who specialises in helping farmers to market their produce. IN:		?We are in Nyong et Kelle ? OUT:		? he will do it. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 23 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Basaguel Samuel of Cameroon?s National Agricultural Extension and Research Programme. Transcript Chindong	We are in Nyong et Kelle Division in the Central Province of Cameroon. In this division you find a lot of cassava, oil palm, cocoa growing in the fields. These crops are the farmers? only source of income. Hence the farmer must find a market. That is why the National Agricultural Extension and Research Programme has specialised technicians that can help farmers to market their produce, and market it well. Mr. Basaguel Samuel is one of these specialised technicians, who helps farmers in the area of marketing. He is right here with us, and he will tell us exactly what he does. The market strategies he has developed for the small-scale farmers. Samuel	I want to say that the marketing strategy depends on the product. Let?s take some examples. The marketing strategy we developed with cassava is that the producer have their product, they process this cassava into flour, also ?gari? and biscuit. So what I {{have to do is to}} take some samples of the product, already processed, and present these samples to people, during a meeting like the one we are attending today, and try to convince people that cassava biscuit is no different from the biscuit made with wheat flour. The marketing strategy we developed with cocoa is quite different. What we do is to go to buyers and tell them that on a very special day per week, per month, they have a market where producers take their product, buyers come, and the one who gets the product is the one who offers the highest price. So there is a small competition between buyers and it is good for the producer. The marketing strategy we have developed also with plantain, is quite different. We go to the market, identify buy-and-sellers, and tell them that in a special area, producers can offer, let?s say 1000 bunches of bananas, and convince people that they can go there and buy at the lowest price, and go to Yaound‚ and sell at the very highest price. The two of them, the buyers and the producers, what we have to do is to put them into contact and they negotiate together. Chindong	Now how do you know where to find these buyers? Samuel	We have also a market strategy. We go to people and ask them what are their needs. Maybe we go to Yaound‚ and know that there are people there who need banana. We go to NCA- that is an organisation in Cameroon dealing with cocoa - we go there and try to identify people who need cocoa, and put them into contact with producers. Chindong	You may seek people who need the produce, but if the produce is not attractive they may not offer good prices. How do you help farmers to make their produce attractive? Samuel	As far as cassava is concerned, we ask them not to sell as a raw material; to process first of all into biscuit. And we know exactly that the <b>biscuit</b> <b>product</b> is not all over the area, all over the province. So that is one way of making the product attractive. Chindong	The farmers have this problem of transportation. Samuel	Yes, it is a big problem. And all the producers have the same problem all over developing countries. Sometimes producers are far away from the area where they can market the product, and so when people go there to buy products it?s cheaper. And also when they have to transport those products to market it?s also a cost added. Chindong	How are you helping them to go about this problem? Samuel	I can?t do anything about transportation. But what I try to do is to reinforce their capacity of production. When they produce so good and so much, so the buyers need products, so they have to go all over where the product is. And when the product is good and cheap, when the buyer can make a good profit, he will do it. End of track. Can agricultural extension services have a role in helping farmers with marketing? In Cameroon the answer is ?Yes?. A government marketing adviser describes the methods he uses to link farmers to buyers, and make their products more marketable...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The {{research}} question {{addressed in this}} paper is how different reference amounts utilised in front of package nutrition labelling influence evaluation of product healthfulness. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A total of 13, 117 participants from six European countries (Germany, UK, Spain, France, Poland and Sweden) were recruited via online panels. A mixed between/within-subject factorial design was employed with food (biscuits, sandwiches, yogurts), healthfulness and presence of Guideline Daily Amounts as within-subjects factors and reference amount ('per 100 g', 'typical portion', 'half portion') and country as between-subjects factors. RESULTS: Overall, people correctly ranked foods according to their objective healthfulness as defined by risk nutrients alone, and could distinguish between more and less healthful variants of foods. General healthfulness associations with the three product categories {{do not appear to}} have had a strong influence on product ratings. This study shows that where the reference amount of 'per 100 g' {{is very different from the}} 'typical' portion size, as was the case for <b>biscuits,</b> <b>products</b> with a 'per 100 g' label are rated significantly less healthful than the 'typical' or 'half typical' portions. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that across the three food categories, consumers do factor the reference amount, that is, the quantity of food for which the nutritional information is being presented, into their judgements of healthfulness. Therefore, appropriate reference amounts are also of importance for the effective presentation of nutritional information...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} a {{homogeneity of}} labour on weekly data from 2009 tillfirst half of 2012 in an anonymous food company with high capital facilities which produce <b>biscuit</b> <b>products.</b> Model is estimated as a Cobb-Douglas production function where behaviour {{and experience of}} operators (age, sex, amount of trainings etc.) {{have an impact on}} an amount of product. The annual amount of product on the given production line is about 5, 000 tons. The amount of output is significantly influenced by age and sex of operators who are working on given production line. If operators get older by one year (ceteris paribus), the amount of production will decrease by 0. 4 % (in practice, it means by 19. 95 tons per year). Another significant characteristic parameter which influences significantly product is sex of operators. If all men working on the given production line will be replaced by women, the amount of products will decrease by 6. 7 % (in practice, it means by 333. 75 tons per year). The experience of operators was measured by the number of completed trainings per one year. It was found that the increased amount of completed trainings {{have a significant impact on}} the amount of produced product. If operators attend additional training quarterly, the production on the given line will increase in better case by 0. 4 % (in practice, it means by 18. 01 tons per year). In this case additional trainings for operators have positive impact on company's revenue. Conclusion is that labour is not as homogenous as was expected in that type of company...|$|R

Purple sweet potato flour has high content of beta-carotene and could be processed into <b>biscuits</b> <b>product.</b> Oyster mushroom flour {{could be used as}} is substituent of purple sweet potato flour to increase the protein content in biscuits. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of oyster mushrooms flour substitution on hardness and acceptability of purple sweet potato biscuits. Completely randomized design was used in this research with 4 types of substitution treatments of oyster mushrooms flour, which were 10 %; 15 %; 20 % and 25 %. Data analysis of hardness and acceptability of purple sweet potato biscuits were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA and followed by Duncan at significance level of 95 %. The results showed that there was a substitution effect of oyster mushroom flour to the level of violence purple sweet potato biscuits with a significance value of p = 0. 001. The highest level of hardness shown by the substitution of 10 % flour oyster mushrooms. There was a substitution effect of oyster mushroom flour to the acceptance of flavor, texture and overall with significant value respectively p = 0. 001; p = 0. 029; and p = 0. 017. There is no substitution effect on the oyster mushroom flour color and flavor acceptability by the significant value of p = 0. 703 and p = 0. 069. Based on acceptability and hardness, it is recommended to use 10 % flour oyster mushrooms on purple sweet potato biscuits and analyze the effect of storability biscuit nutritional value and hardness for advanced research...|$|R

The purpose of this study is to know the shelf life of modified suweg flour biscuits, wheat flour, and mocaf flour and to know the appropriate type of packaging. The research method consists of preliminary research and main research. the preliminary research undertaken is the manufacture and characterization of modified autoshlaving-cooling cycle modified suweg. while the main research is the estimation of shelf life in the modified <b>biscuit</b> <b>products</b> of modified autoclaving-cooling cycle. Determination based on water content parameters, peroxide number and TPC. And different packaging are aluminum foil and metalized. The result showed that suitable packaging for modified suweg biscuits was metalized packaging. Based on research of determination of shelf life by Arrhenius method with different storage temperature yielding modified suweg biscuits and biscuit blanco (without modified suweg flour) with different shelf life. So it can be concluded that shelf life is determined from the parameter of peroxide number for modified suweg biscuits at 15 °C, 30 °C and 45 °C with metallized packing of 217 days, 172 days and 137 days While for biscuit blanko(without modified suweg flour) at 15 ° C, 30 °C and 45 °C with metalized packing respectively that is 333 days, 250 days and 192 days...|$|R
