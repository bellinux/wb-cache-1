[...] He said that the PlayStation 3's hardware capabilities allowed more flexibility in character creation and interaction with the environment. The character model for Kratos in the PlayStation 2 (PS2) games used about 5,000 polygons; the PS3 model was about 20,000 – a high number, but less than that used by other models such as Nathan Drake in , who used 35,000. Ken Feldman, the art director, commented that the polygon count was not the only factor, and cited the increased texture detail as {{one of the reasons for}} Kratos's realistic appearance. The developers used a new technique called blended normal mapping to add realism to the basic model and hugely enhance the range of animation available (e.g., muscle movement, including visible veins, and facial animations). All of the main protagonists were animated by hand because the animators produced more effective work than <b>basic</b> <b>motion</b> capture, though the voice actors' facial movements were recorded by Image Metrics's performance capture system. For animating things like hair, the animators created a secondary animation code, known as Dynamic Simulation, which allows the PS3 itself to mathematically calculate the way it should look; it accurately generates motion that previously took the animators long hours to replicate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. There is a keen {{demand for}} a method of sharing better work {{practices}} in a factory because better work practices {{are the key to}} improving productivity. We have developed a system that can measure a worker's motion and automatically generate a manual that describes his movements. This system employs motion study as used in Industrial Engineering to identify the important steps in a job, and it has proven to be effective especially in the fields of factory machine operation and maintenance. However, work procedures often include unique <b>basic</b> <b>motions.</b> The determination of <b>basic</b> <b>motions</b> and the creation of an algorithm that can classify these <b>basic</b> <b>motions</b> are time consuming and complex tasks. Therefore we have employed the C 4. 5 algorithm to discover rules that classify the <b>basic</b> <b>motions.</b> Experimental results prove that our method can successfully discover rules for various work procedures. ...|$|R

50|$|Besides the <b>basic</b> <b>motion</b> of needles, loopers and bobbins, the {{material}} being sewn must move {{so that each}} cycle of needle motion involves {{a different part of}} {{the material}}. This motion is known as feed, and sewing machines have almost as many ways of feeding material as they do of forming stitches. For general categories, there are: drop feed, needle feed, walking foot, puller, and manual. Often, multiple types of feed are used on the same machine. Besides these general categories, there are also uncommon feed mechanisms used in specific applications like edge joining fur, making seams on caps, and blindstitching.|$|E
5000|$|The Carrier verb is {{extremely}} complex. A single verb may {{have hundreds of}} thousands of forms. Verbs are marked for the person and number of the subject, object, and indirect object, tense, mood, numerous aspectual categories, and negation. The subjects of verbs, and in some dialects objects and indirect objects, distinguish singular, dual, and plural numbers. Verbs are also marked for numerous [...] "derivational" [...] categories. For example, a <b>basic</b> <b>motion</b> verb, such as [...] "walk" [...] has derivatives meaning [...] "walk into water", [...] "walk into a hole", [...] "walk ashore", [...] "walk around" [...] and [...] "walk erroneously" [...] (that is, [...] "get lost walking").|$|E

50|$|Each letter {{consisted}} {{of a combination of}} three <b>basic</b> <b>motions.</b> All began with the flagman holding his device vertically and motionless above his head. The first motion was initiated by bringing the device downward on the signalman's right side and then quickly returning it to its upright position. The second motion brought the device down on the left side and then returned it to the starting position. The third motion lowered the device in front of the signalman, then restored it to its vertical position.|$|R
50|$|This Furby was {{released}} in August 2005. Larger than the previous version, the new Furbies have been upgraded with a more emotional face and a voice recognition system, enabling them to communicate with humans. Unlike the Furbies originally released, just one order is necessary to make them 'sleep', and they have an on/off switch. They can communicate with other Emoto-tronic Furbies, though {{to a lesser extent}} than the communication between original Furbies, and they cannot themselves communicate with the original Furbies nor Funky Furbies. They also lack light sensors and <b>basic</b> <b>motion</b> sensors and do not respond to loud sounds as the originals do. These Furbies, according to the story they come packed with, are from Furby Island.|$|E
50|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>motion</b> is a forehanded sidearm movement. The discus is {{spun off}} {{the index finger}} or the middle finger of the {{throwing}} hand. In flight the disc spins clockwise when viewed from above for a right-handed thrower, and anticlockwise for a left-handed thrower. As well as achieving maximum momentum in the discus on throwing, the discus' distance is also determined by the trajectory the thrower imparts, {{as well as the}} aerodynamic behavior of the discus. Generally, throws into a moderate headwind achieve the maximum distance. Also, a faster-spinning discus imparts greater gyroscopic stability. The technique of discus throwing is quite difficult to master and needs lots of experience to get right, thus most top throwers are 30 years old or more.|$|E
50|$|Media {{players are}} often {{designed}} for compactness and affordability, {{and tend to}} have small or non-existent hardware displays other than simple LED lights to indicate whether the device is powered on. Interface navigation on the television is usually done with an infrared remote control, while more-advanced digital media players come with high-performance remote controls which allow control of the interface using integrated touch sensors. Some remotes also include accelerometers for air mouse features which allow <b>basic</b> <b>motion</b> gaming. Most digital media player devices are unable to play physical audio or video media directly, and instead require a user to convert these media into playable digital files using a separate computer and software. They are also usually incapable of recording audio or video. In the 2010s, it is also common to find digital media player functionality integrated into other consumer-electronics appliances, such as DVD players, set-top boxes, Smart TVs, or even video game consoles, although these devices are {{beyond the scope of}} this article.|$|E

5000|$|The TV is {{natively}} only {{capable of}} displaying 120 frames per second, and <b>basic</b> <b>motion</b> interpolation which inserts between 1 and 4 new frames between existing ones. Typically {{the only difference}} from a [...] "120 Hz" [...] TV {{in this case is}} the addition of a strobing backlight, which flickers on and off at 240 Hz, once after every 120 Hz frame. The intent of a strobing backlight is to increase the apparent response rate and thus reduce ghosting, which results in smoother motion overall. However, this technique {{has nothing to do with}} actual framerate. For active 3D, this framerate is halved, and no motion interpolation or pulldown functionality is typically provided. 600 Hz is an oft-advertised figure for plasma TVs, and while technically correct, it only refers to an inter-frame response time of 1.6 milliseconds. This can significantly reduce ghosting and thus improve motion quality, but is unrelated to interpolation and content framerate. There are no consumer films shot at 600 frames per second, nor any TV processors capable of generating 576 interpolated frames per second.|$|E
