5|$|After {{ten days}} she was {{returned}} to sea and reached Port Dalrymple {{on the morning of}} 5 November. Buffalo had already arrived, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of Lady Nelson or Francis. Houstoun's achievement in navigating the storm was recognised through a transfer to Buffalo, a larger and more prestigious vessel than Integrity. His former colonial command was allocated to midshipman Charles Robbins, who was promoted Acting Lieutenant by virtue of his new role. The remaining vessels in the flotilla, Lady Nelson and Francis, arrived in Port Dalrymple on 21 November. Integrity departed a week later, Robbins having been ordered to explore the far western coastline of Van Diemen's Land.|$|E
5|$|The villa {{was soon}} cleared of enemy troops once more, and when Frost {{returned}} to the beach, {{he found that the}} machine-gun nest had been destroyed by the mis-dropped troops of 'Nelson'; avoiding other enemy positions, they had reached the beach and attacked the machine-gun post from the flank. By this time it was 02:15 <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of the naval force that was to evacuate the airborne troops. Frost ordered 'Nelson' to guard the inland approaches to the beach and then fired off an emergency signal flare; soon after that the naval force was seen approaching. The original plan for the operation had called for two landing craft at a time to land on the beach, but this had never been satisfactorily achieved during training; instead, all six landing craft landed at the same time, with the covering troops in the landing craft opening fire on German soldiers gathering {{at the top of the}} cliff.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E

25|$|The gatekeeper's Cottage at The Causeway {{was well}} maintained, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of the {{existence}} of the signal box, although a piece of rail was in place as a gate stop and some railway sleepers were being used a gate posts which could possibly have come from the railway. A level crossing gate concrete post survived at Chanter's Lane. A bridge with brick sides and iron girders existed near Kenwith Castle, together with signs of a low embankment and a cutting running through solid rock.|$|E
25|$|Although clouds {{extended}} down {{as low as}} 300–400 {{feet above}} the sea surface and surface visibility had fallen to 1,500–2,500 meters at Campeltown Airport, the wind was from the west at 12 knots, and the aircraft was below the freezing level (reported at 6,500 feet). Conditions {{at the time of}} the accident made it possible for ice to form in the carburetors, and carburetor heat was not applied to counteract this possibility, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> that the engine function was impaired. The switches for pitot and stall warning probe heating, and for propeller de‑icing were selected ON. The switches for airframe de-icing, heated windshield and for the ice inspection lamp were selected OFF.|$|E
500|$|For {{the most}} part, the long passage across the Weddell Sea {{proceeded}} uneventfully. There was a growing level of unrest among the crew, perhaps provoked by disappointment with the apparent aimlessness of the voyage; Worsley {{in particular was}} critical of Wild's leadership. Wild, in his own account, dealt with this discontent {{by the threat of}} [...] "the most drastic treatment". On 12 March they reached 64°11'S, 46°4'W, which was the area where Ross had recorded an [...] "Appearance of Land" [...] in 1842, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of it, and a depth sounding of over 2,300fathoms (13,800ft, 4,200m.) indicated no likelihood of land nearby. Between 15–21 March Quest was frozen into the ice, and the shortage of coal became a major concern. Wild hoped that the diminished fuel supply could be supplemented by blubber from the seals at Elephant Island. On 25 March the island was sighted. Wild wanted if possible to revisit Cape Wild, the site of the old Endurance expedition camp, but bad weather prevented this. They viewed the site through binoculars, picking out the old landmarks, before landing on the western coast to hunt for elephant seals. They were able to obtain sufficient blubber to mix with the coal so that, aided by a favourable wind, they reached South Georgia on 6 April.|$|E

2500|$|In Brussels, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer {{said through}} his {{spokesman}} {{that he is}} concerned [...] "about {{the conduct of the}} elections, in particular when it comes to freedom of expression and association," [...] <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of any change of the alliance's policy towards Moscow. Van den Brande also said there was no prospect of Russia being thrown out of the Council of Europe.|$|E
2500|$|After the Sioux had departed, Sibley marched his men unmolested for 18 {{miles and}} camped on Apple Creek, about 10 miles {{southeast}} of present-day Bismarck, North Dakota. [...] He had anticipated meeting Sully, {{who was supposed to}} be proceeding up the Missouri River by steamboat, near there <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of him. [...] The next morning, July 29, Sibley sent two howitzers and his mounted Rangers forward about 12 miles to attempt to prevent the Sioux from crossing the Missouri River. [...] He was too late; most had crossed the preceding day, but, in their hasty flight had been forced to abandon many of their belongings.|$|E
2500|$|This attack had {{compromised}} surprise – and {{the attack}} on Mega was now commenced in all urgency. The 1st SA Irish (Col. Dobbs) were tasked to take the ridges east of Mega fort while the 3rd Transvaal Scottish (Lt-Col. Walter Kirby) were to occupy the a series of hills west of the fort and were to advance {{in line with the}} SA Irish. 2nd Brigade was to launch a direct attack on the fort and the Mega defensive complex. Despite incoming artillery fire, the Irish and Scottish regiments advances progressed well – <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of the 2nd Brigade who had not yet crossed the start-line, threatening to destroy the planned attack! At noon, a torrential rainstorm erupted and a thick mist enveloped the heights around Mega and it became obvious that the fort would not be taken by nightfall. The next morning, cloud and mist prevented air support [...] and the Irish and Scottish battalions restarted their advance. It was only after the third day that the 2nd Brigade managed to reach their designated start-line due to poor navigation and the failure to identify serious terrain obstacles on their line of advance during reconnaissance. Clear skies on the third day permitted a coordinated attack with air support, artillery and the two brigades attacking together [...] leading to an Italian surrender late that afternoon (18 February).|$|E
