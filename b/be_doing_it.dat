25|$|Young {{contended that}} he was merely acting {{for the state of}} Minnesota when he sought to enforce its laws. The Court disagreed, holding that when a state {{official}} does something that is unconstitutional, the official cannot possibly <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> {{in the name of the}} state, because the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution means that the Constitution overrides all the laws of the states, invalidating any contrary laws. Therefore, when a state official attempts to enforce an unconstitutional law, that individual is stripped of his official character. He becomes merely another citizen who can constitutionally be brought before a court by a party seeking injunctive relief.|$|E
500|$|PewDiePie {{formerly}} put out videos {{with a high}} frequency, {{something he}} scaled down in 2014. By early 2017, he had uploaded almost 3,500 videos to his channel, around 400 {{of which have been}} made private. In March 2017, PewDiePie commented that his channel was running on a daily output, stating, [...] " [...] a lot of challenges in doing daily content, it's stupid. I really shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it,</b> I really should just fucking go back and upload twice a week or some shit, and then take a step back, but I still really, really love the daily challenge—the daily grind—of just being like, 'hey, I'm gonna make a video today, no matter what.' And sometimes it really works, and sometimes it doesn't." ...|$|E
500|$|The pilot episode {{introduces}} the six main {{characters of the}} series, {{as well as the}} cast of supporting characters. Casey McCall, one of the co-anchors of Sports Night, a sports television roundup show running at 11pm on CSC, the [...] "number 3 sports network" [...] – a channel modeled on ESPN and similar – is displaying a negative attitude, both on and off screen, {{as a result of his}} recent divorce. Dan Rydell, his co-anchor, tries to get back his positive attitude, while J.J. and the network executives begin to get vocal about his need to improve or leave the company. Dana Whitaker, his producer, vociferously defends him to the executive producer, Isaac Jaffe, even while she tries to get him to shape up before they override her shielding of him. At the same time, Casey himself is thinking about quitting sports broadcasting, citing the moral decay he's seen on the job, in spite of Dan's observation that he'd only <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> for the wrong reasons. Dana also hires a new associate producer, the highly strung but brilliant Jeremy Goodwin, who co-producer Natalie Hurley takes a liking to. At the end of the episode, a unique sporting event involving the return of a 41-year-old injured athlete to the running track makes Casey change his mind.|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} aired on December 3, 2009, on the CNBC documentary [...] "Inside the Mind of Google," [...] Schmidt was asked, [...] "People are treating Google like their most trusted friend.

Why shouldn't I be known to <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it?</b> You know, why shouldn't I get the credit for something that I'm actually doing?' So I just basically did it, and I didn't tell anybody, whereas the process before was, I would tell people that I was getting ready to do it, then we would gear up to do it, and then people would get involved, and the credit would go wherever.

2500|$|On 22 June 2007, U.S. News & World Report editor Robert Morse {{issued a}} {{response}} {{in which he}} argued, [...] "in terms of the peer assessment survey, we at U.S. News firmly believe the survey has significant value because {{it allows us to}} measure the [...] "intangibles" [...] of a college that we can't measure through statistical data. Plus, the reputation of a school can help get that all-important first job and plays a key part in which grad school someone {{will be able to get}} into. The peer survey is by nature subjective, but the technique of asking industry leaders to rate their competitors is a commonly accepted practice. The results from the peer survey also can act to level the playing field between private and public colleges."
