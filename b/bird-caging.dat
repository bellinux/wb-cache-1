50|$|Although {{there were}} many {{variations}} before it, the <b>Bird‐Cage</b> house was the epitome of indoor‐outdoor living, where the envelope between the inside and outside was barely distinguishable. Designed for Michael Heller, an appliance salesman, the materials used by Polevitzky to construct the house were of the latest post‐war technology, so advanced that many critics {{at the time were}} unsure how the materials could be purchased. Polevitzky’s submission to the GI Homes competition in 1946, just three years before the completion of the <b>Bird‐Cage</b> featured the same materials. In this competition, Polevitzky was placed second. The jury, composed of leading architects of the region, commented that although the designs were exceptional, they were unsure of the availability of the materials Polevitzky selected. The <b>Bird‐Cage</b> house was a full‐scale demonstration of these materials.|$|R

50|$|A <b>bird-cage</b> lantern was {{the style}} of lantern common to American lighthouses {{in the early years}} of the nineteenth century. The {{lanterns}} received their name because of their appearance; they are shaped like wire bird cages. When Fresnel lenses were introduced to the country in the 1850s, most lighthouses were retrofitted with new lanterns, as the older ones could not support the new style of lens. Consequently, only four lighthouses with original <b>bird-cage</b> lanterns survive in the United States; those that do were discontinued before they could be fitted for the new lantern.|$|R
50|$|A {{description}} of the church says how {{there was an old}} gallery in the church with its <b>bird-cage</b> pew. This pew was completely enclosed with lattice work and its front was ornamented with filigree work, presenting the appearance of a box at the opera, and thus named the <b>bird-cage.</b> This was the old manor pew, and was occupied by the judges and High Sheriff at the Assize sermon, and used upon other state occasions. The church also had a pulpit at the front which was nicknamed by the congregation a 'three-decker'.|$|R

5000|$|One 19th-century visitor was unimpressed by the cathedral's appearance: [...] "The {{attempt at}} a tower is conspicuously mean and hideous. A pile of emigrants' luggage with a {{rabbit-hutch}} or <b>bird-cage</b> overhead would look equally imposing".|$|R
