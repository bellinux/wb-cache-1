5|$|Djungarian hamsters {{are common}} as pets in Europe and North America, and exhibit greater {{variance}} in their coats than {{those found in}} the wild. They reproduce often—more so than Syrian hamsters, and as they have no fixed breeding season, can continue to produce large numbers of offspring all year round.

50|$|In cooperatively {{breeding}} meerkats (Suricata suricatta) {{the dominant}} <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> {{is the oldest}} and heaviest female who is highly aggressive toward subordinate <b>females</b> during the <b>breeding</b> season and temporarily evicts subordinate females from the group. Evicted subordinates suffer repeated attacks during the later stages of the <b>breeding</b> <b>female's</b> pregnancy and showed GC levels two times higher than normal. Approximately 3 days after their birth, subordinate females return to the group to help rear the <b>breeding</b> <b>female's</b> pups, at which time the dominant female is no longer aggressive toward them. By inducing the stress response in subordinates the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> disrupts the ovulatory cycle and prevents mating of the subordinate females, or causes the pregnancies of subordinates to fail if they do occur. If her social group is small the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> evicts all subordinate females, {{but if it is}} large she targets older females, pregnant females and non-kin.|$|R

Gatherings of males compete for <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> with each male displaying its colourful plumage, bobbing and hopping, and making a variety of calls. After mating, the female makes a nest under a rocky overhang, incubates the eggs, and rears the young, all by herself.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 {{the total}} Jacob {{population}} in the UK was reported to the DAD-IS database of the FAO as 5638, of which 2349 were registered breeding ewes. In 2017, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust listed the Jacob in Category 6 ("Other UK Native Breeds") of its watchlist, in which categories 1–5 are for various degrees of conservation risk, and category 6 is for breeds which have more than 3000 <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> registered in the herd-book. Small numbers of Jacobs are reported from four other countries: the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States, with conservation status in those countries ranging from critical to endangered-maintained.|$|E
5|$|The larvae grow {{through a}} series of four or five moults and enter the pupal stage. The pupa has the {{appendages}} free and not fused to the body as in a butterfly pupa. The differentiation into queens and workers (which are both female), and different castes of workers, is influenced in some species by the nutrition the larvae obtain. Genetic influences and the control of gene expression by the developmental environment are complex and the determination of caste continues to be a subject of research. Winged male ants, called drones, emerge from pupae along with the usually winged <b>breeding</b> <b>females.</b> Some species, such as army ants, have wingless queens. Larvae and pupae need to be kept at fairly constant temperatures to ensure proper development, and so often, are moved around among the various brood chambers within the colony.|$|E

25|$|The dhole is {{a highly}} social animal, living in large clans without rigid {{dominance}} hierarchies and containing multiple <b>breeding</b> <b>females.</b> Such clans usually consist of 12 individuals, but groups of over 40 are known. It is a diurnal pack hunter which preferentially targets medium and large sized ungulates. In tropical forests, the dhole competes with tigers and leopards, targeting somewhat different prey species, but still with substantial dietary overlap.|$|E
25|$|A third risk is an {{inability}} to find mating partners. With so few whales in such a large area, simply finding a mate is difficult. Right whales generally travel alone or in very small groups. In other oceans, <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> attract mates by calling. The success of this strategy depends upon having males within hearing range. As expanding shipping traffic increases the ocean's background noise, the audible range for such mating calls has decreased.|$|E
25|$|This {{does not}} mean that they are not {{purebred}} Chihuahuas; they just do not meet the requirements to enter a conformation show. Oversized Chihuahuas are seen in some of the best, and worst, bloodlines. Chihuahuas do not breed true for size, and puppies from the same litter can mature drastically different sizes from one another. As well, larger <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> are less likely to experience dystocia. Typically, the breed standard for both the long and short coat Chihuahua will be identical except for the description of the coat. Chihuahuas have large, round eyes and large, erect ears, set in a high, dramatically rounded skull.|$|E

5000|$|Infanticide is a {{mechanism}} of reproductive success {{that occurs in}} many species. Alpha female dwarf mongooses and African wild dogs kill offpring other than their own, but alpha males do not use infanticide to enforce reproductive suppression. This may occur because the breeding alpha may have sired a rare subordinate's offspring. Subordinate females time their rare pregnancies such that they give birth several days after the alpha female {{to reduce the risk}} of infanticide.Pregnant suborordinate meerkats are known to kill the pups of the dominant <b>breeding</b> <b>female.</b> No dominant female pups have ever been observed killed after their 4th day of life. Evicted subordinate females are kept out for 3 days after the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> gave birth.Eight infanticides involving the killing of a subordinate female's offspring by the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> have been observed in wild common marmosets, as well as two instances of infanticide in which the subordinate female bred and then killed the <b>breeding</b> <b>female's</b> babies. [...] Infanticidal marmoset females are often in the last trimester of pregnancy, but postpartum females don't commit infanticide.|$|R
25|$|During {{the mating}} season, Iriomote cats become active {{during the day}} as well. <b>Breeding</b> <b>females</b> are more active than non{{breeding}} ones during the late night and morning hours. Outside the mating season the cats live in solitary, but when they begin breeding they act together. The mating season lasts from December to March, and females go into heat several times during this period, with the peak being in January and February. Towards the end of February, they fast for about two weeks. It is during this period that females are most sexually excited. Male and female cats always stay together at this time, and {{it is thought that}} conception happens during these two weeks.|$|E
25|$|DNA barcoding {{is based}} on a {{relatively}} simple concept. All eukaryote cells contain mitochondria, and animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has a relatively fast mutation rate, resulting in the generation of diversity within and between populations over relatively short evolutionary timescales (thousands of generations). Typically, in animals, a single mtDNA genome is transmitted to offspring by each breeding female, and the genetic effective population size is proportional to the number of <b>breeding</b> <b>females.</b> This contrasts with the nuclear genome, which is around 100 000 times larger, where males and females each contribute two full genomes to the gene pool and effective size is therefore proportional to twice the total population size. This reduction in effective population size leads to more rapid sorting of mtDNA gene lineages within and among populations through time, due to variance in fecundity among individuals (the principle of coalescence). The combined effect of higher mutation rates and more rapid sorting of variation usually results in divergence of mtDNA sequences among species and a comparatively small variance within species. A 658-bp region (the Folmer region) of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI or COX1) gene was proposed as a potential 'barcode'.|$|E

500|$|In 2014, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust (RBST) {{conservation}} charity watch-listed the New Forest pony in its [...] "minority breed" [...] category, {{given the}} presence of less than 3,000 <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> in the forest. Over the course of five years, the number of foals born each year had dropped by two-thirds (from 1,563 to just 423 in 2013)– a change attributed by The New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society to a declining market, and by the New Forest Verderers to steps that had been taken {{to improve the quality}} rather than the quantity of foals.|$|E
500|$|A {{wide range}} of {{reproductive}} strategies have been noted in ant species. Females of many species {{are known to be}} capable of reproducing asexually through thelytokous parthenogenesis. Secretions from the male accessory glands in some species can plug the female genital opening and prevent females from re-mating. Most ant species have a system in which only the queen and <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> have the ability to mate. Contrary to popular belief, some ant nests have multiple queens, while others may exist without queens. Workers with the ability to reproduce are called [...] "gamergates" [...] and colonies that lack queens are then called gamergate colonies; colonies with queens are said to be queen-right.|$|E
500|$|In the 1990s, the breed's {{popularity}} and numbers began to rise. By 2005, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust had moved the breed to [...] "at risk" [...] status, meaning {{there were fewer}} than 1,500 <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> in the UK. However, by 2010 they had been moved back to vulnerable. The Clydesdale {{is considered to be}} at [...] "watch" [...] status by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, meaning that as of 2010 fewer than 2,500 horses are registered annually in the USA and fewer than 10,000 exist worldwide. As of 2010, there are estimated to be around 5,000 Clydesdales worldwide, with around 4,000 in the US and Canada, 800 in the UK and the rest in other countries, including Russia, Japan, Germany and South Africa.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of helpers allows the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> to reduce her prenatal {{investment in the}} offspring, which may lead to altricial births; altricial is the production of young which are dependent upon adult aid to survive. This enables the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> to retain energy to be used within a new breeding attempt. Overall, the addition of helpers to a breeding pair encourages multiple reproductions per year, and increases the rate of successful reproduction.|$|R

500|$|In 1954 {{there were}} 2195 Large Black pigs recorded, 269 {{licensed}} boars and 1926 registered sows, representing approximately 3.4% of the UK pig {{population of about}} 65,000. At the end of 2011 there were 421 Large Black pigs (86 boars and 335 sows) registered, a small increase over the 2010 figure of 405 (65 boars, 340 sows). The Large Black is the rarest historic pig breed in Britain, although numbers are slowly on the rise due {{to an increase in}} demand for meat from traditional pig breeds. In 2011 it was classified as [...] "vulnerable" [...] on the watchlist of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, meaning that there are believed to be between 200 and 300 <b>breeding</b> <b>females.</b> The British Pig Association currently recognizes 6 boar lines and 24 sow lines within the breed.|$|E
500|$|Large {{numbers of}} Clydesdales were {{exported}} from Scotland {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, with 1,617 stallions leaving the country in 1911 alone. Between 1884 and 1945, export certificates were issued for 20,183 horses. These horses were exported to {{other countries in the}} British Empire, as well as North and South America, continental Europe and Russia. World War I saw the conscription of thousands of horses for the war effort, and after the war breed numbers declined as farms became increasingly mechanised. This decline continued between the wars. [...] Following World War II the number of Clydesdale breeding stallions in England dropped from more than 200 in 1946 to 80 in 1949. By 1975, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust considered them vulnerable to extinction, meaning there were fewer than 900 <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> in the UK.|$|E
500|$|The {{gray wolf}} is {{generally}} monogamous, with mated pairs usually remaining together for life. Upon {{the death of}} one mated wolf, pairs are quickly re-established. Since males often predominate in any given wolf population, unpaired females are a rarity. If a dispersing male gray wolf is unable to establish a territory or find a mate, he mates with the daughters of already established breeding pairs from other packs. Such gray wolves are termed [...] "Casanova wolves" [...] and, unlike males from established packs, they do not form pair bonds with the females they mate with. Some gray wolf packs may have multiple <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> this way, {{as is the case in}} Yellowstone National Park. Gray wolves also practice alloparental care, in which a wolf pair may adopt the pup or pups of another. This might take place if the original parents die or are for some reason separated from them. In addition to heterosexual behavior, homosexual behavior has been observed in gray wolves. Male gray wolves often mount each other when the highest ranking female in the pack comes into heat.|$|E
50|$|Male {{daffodil}} cichlids are facultatively polygynous. Polygyny {{is regarded}} as a beneficial mating strategy for males, whereas females often suffer a reduction in pair male contributions. Some males hold only one territory with one <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> while other males hold multiple territories, each one with its own <b>breeding</b> <b>female.</b> Polygynous males are larger in size, body-scraped less (they suffered less from ectoparasites), have larger testes (when controlled for body mass), and have higher circulating levels of 11-ketotestosterone than monogamous males.|$|R
