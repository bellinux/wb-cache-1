40|$|In this study, {{the factors}} {{affecting}} sulphur distribution (Ls), phosphorus distribution (Lp), sulphide capacity (S − 2 C) and phosphide capacity (P− 3 C) of ferrochromium smelting slags were investigated {{under reducing conditions}} at 1600 oC. Also, sulphur distribution (Ls) and sulphide capacity (S − 2 C) of ferromanganese smelting slags were studied under reducing conditions at 1500 oC. The {{results showed that the}} logarithms of sulphide capacities varied between - 7. 67 to - 9. 28 and the logarithms of phosphide capacities were between - 15. 20 and - 12. 69 for ferrochromium smelting slags. On the other hand the logarithms of sulphide capacities of ferromanganese slags were found to be change between - 7. 63 and - 8. 11. The experimental results indicated that CaO, SiO 2, MgO and <b>basicity</b> <b>ratio</b> of the slags were the main factors affecting phosphide and sulphide capacities of ferroalloy smelting slags. According to the results, the transfer of sulphur and phosphorus from metal to slag phase increases with increase in the <b>basicity</b> <b>ratio,</b> calcium oxide and magnesium oxide content of ferroalloys smelting slags. Also, it was found that sulphide and phosphide capacities of ferroalloys smelting slags tend to decrease with increasing concentration of silica in the slag phase. Structural models based on binding energy of O- 2 ions in the slag systems were developed by using the linear relations among the logarithm of sulphide and phosphide capacities of slags. In addition to these models, easy to use quadratic multivariable regression model equations were developed in order to express sulphide and phosphide capacities of the ferroalloy smelting slags and sulphur and phosphorus partition ratios between slag and metal phases. These simple models which are combination of regression and thermodynamic approaches can be used in industrial ferrochromium and ferromanganese smelting operations. The usage of these models can help ferroalloy smelting process engineers to predict sulphide and phosphide capacities of the relevant slag systems...|$|E
40|$|Enhanced {{coagulation}} {{is considered}} to be among the best available techniques (BAT) for disinfection by-product (DBP) precursor removal in water treatment. Improving existing &# 39;understanding requires further consideration of nuances of chemical speciation relative to source water chemistry. In this paper, the effect of alkalinity/pH and speciation on inorganic polymer flocculants, polyaluminum chlorides (PACls) for enhanced particle and natural organic matter (NOM) removal was investigated. Three kinds of well-characterized typical source waters in China with low, moderate, and high alkalinity were selected. Performance of coagulants is controlled not only by preformed species but also by those formed in situ. At neutral and basic pH values, PACls with higher <b>basicity</b> (<b>ratio</b> of OH-/Al), which have more stable preformed Al-b (the rapid reacted species as in ferron assay), are more efficient for turbidity and NOM removal. At slightly acidic pH, PACls with lower basicity are more efficient since more Alb can be formed in situ. Optimal NOM removal was achieved at pH 5. 5 - 6. 5 for all PACls. Basicity, speciation, and dosage of coagulant should be optimized based on raw water alkalinity to enhance the removal efficiency of NOM. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{preparation}} of composite bioflocculants from compound bioflocculant (CBF) and poly-aluminum chloride (PACl) was investigated under different PACl/CBF <b>ratios</b> (v/v), <b>basicities</b> ([OH]/[Al] <b>ratios)</b> and polymerization approaches: the composite polymerization (PAClCBF) and the co-polymerization (PCBFACl). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Al-ferron spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and zeta potentials studies were performed as well to characterize the composite bioflocculants. Finally, coagulation performance and floc properties of the composite bioflocculant in comparison with dual-coagulants were studied for treatment of kaolin suspension with different concentrations. From the results, interactions took place between Al species and CBF molecules, which lead {{to the formation of}} composite species. Significant improvement of coagulation efficiency was achieved by composite bioflocculants at PACl/CBF ratio ranging from 0. 05 to 0. 25 and basicity ranging from 1. 1 to 1. 7. PAClCBF appeared to be more efficient than PCBFACl owing to their higher Al-b content. Furthermore, composite bioflocculants was more preferred than dual-coagulants for treatment of kaolin suspension with lower concentrations (< 50 mg/L). (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract-The {{adsorption}} of hydroxy-Al by the 2 - 0. 2 /x size {{fractions of}} muscovite, biotite, K-depleted micas, vermiculite and montmorillonite was studied. The {{differences in the}} amounts of hydroxy-Al adsorbed were apparently related to the expansibility and layer charge of minerals, the ionic saturation and degree of K-depletion, the <b>basicity</b> (OH/AI <b>ratio)</b> of the equilibrating hydroxy-Al solution, and the solution-clay ratio. The CEC reduction was not necessarily proportional {{to the amount of}} AI adsorbed because CEC reduction may occur through occupation of cation exchange sites by hydroxy-AI, or through indrance to the entry of the replacing cation to these sites. Alumi-num interlayering generally increases the K/Ca cation exchange selectivity (CES) of Na-vermiculite and K-depleted biotite, whereas the K/Ca CES of Na-montmorillonite was little affected. The basicity of the initial hydroxy-Al solution appeared to affect the K/Ca CES of Na-vermiculite and K-depleted biotite by controlling the amount of hydroxyl-Al adsorbed. The data indicate that in addition to the "propping effect", hydroxy-Al interlayers may affect the K/Ca CES through the following mechan-isms; (1) the "preferential occupation " of Ca adsorbing sites, and/or (2) the "retarding effect " on the entry of the more hydrated Ca ions...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{structurally}} modified LarMnO 3 d (r 0. 80, 1. 00, 1. 25) perovskites {{have been investigated}} for ethanol deep oxidation in the temperature range 100 – 3008 C. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer– Emmet–Teller (BET) surface area analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), redox titration and CO 2 adsorption. All samples are single perovskite phases without segregated phases. For La- and Mn-under-stoichiometric samples, the defects generated to maintain structure electroneutrality are positive holes and anion vacancies whereas for stoichiometric solids, the defects are positive holes and cation vacancies. The surface oxidation state and composition are critically controlled by the phase composition of the bulk. XPS {{results showed that the}} decrease in bulk La/Mn ratio induced a decrease in surface La enrichment. A concomitant decrease of basic site concentration was shown by CO 2 adsorption. With lower surface La content, excess Mn sites and increasing concentrations of surface Mn 4 þ were observed. Catalytic properties in the oxidation reaction of ethanol are attributed to the variability of the manganese oxidation state, basic character of the material surface, which is related to the La/Mn atomic ratio, and to the oxygen storage capacity in the crystalline lattice of the catalysts. It was shown that La 0. 8 MnO 3 –d presents the best catalytic activity, due to low surface <b>basicity</b> (lowest La/Mn <b>ratio)</b> and high redox properties (highest Mn 4 þ/Mn 3 þ ratio) ...|$|R
40|$|Basic {{oxygen furnace}} (BOF) slag is a main {{by-product}} generated during converter steelmaking. Valorization of BOF slag {{contributes to the}} sustainability of the steel industry and alleviates the environmental burden significantly. The present research is dedicated to investigate the valorization of BOF slag with respect to recover metal and apply the slag in constructional productions that create added value. In {{the first part of}} the research, the carbothermic reduction of BOF slag was investigated systematically. Reduction of Fe and P containing phases was discussed. Effects of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 additions on the microstructure and mineralogy associated with the reduction process were also investigated. Formation and growth mechanisms of the extracted metallic phase were explored. The second part of this research focuses on optimization of slag solidification to prevent slag expansion and obtain enhanced cementitious/hydraulic properties. Influence of Al 2 O 3, <b>basicity</b> (mass <b>ratio</b> of CaO/SiO 2), and oxygen partial pressure on the BOF slag was studied in detail. The effect of Al 2 O 3 addition on the mineralogical modification and crystallization kinetics of BOF slag was studied by both water quenching and in-situ observations. Continuous cooling transformation (CCT) and time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagrams were constructed. The critical cooling rate to vitrify BOF slag was, for the first time, determined quantitatively. Crystallization sequence was clarified by integrating the in-situ observations and post-mortem analysis with thermodynamic calculations. To reveal the influence of basicity and oxygen partial pressure on the mineralogical and morphological modification of BOF slag, original and SiO 2 modified slags were re-melted and solidified under argon and/or air atmosphere followed by slow cooling. Experimental observations were then compared with the results of thermodynamic modelling to achieve a thorough understanding. The effects of basicity and oxygen partial pressure were then evaluated with respect to the energy consumption for the slag valorization. Finally, a SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 modified BOF slag was water granulated at a pilot scale. The amorphous and mineral fractions were measured quantitatively. A mathematical model was developed to provide an insight into the crystallization behavior during the granulation. Temperature profiles of the slag particles with different sizes were calculated with the aid of COMSOL Multiphysics software. The findings of this research suggest an important approach to optimize the microstructure/mineralogy of the solidified slag through modifying slag chemistry and solidification conditions. The present study provides a fundamental basis for “Zero waste” of BOF slag, which will be achieved by innovation of the hot-stage slag engineering with both metal recovery and slag utilization. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{eutectic}} temperature between iron and carbon is 1150 °C. This {{is the lowest}} temperature in which Fe-C solution can be tapped from a blast furnace. Current operating temperatures of iron blast furnace are much higher than 1150 ° Cand limited bymelting temperature of the slag. There is room to lower the operating temperature of the iron blast furnace. As a result, coke consumption and CO 2 gas emissions can be reduced and campaign length of the furnace can be increased. Akey factor in achieving the low operating temperature of the blast furnace is to use an optimum slag composition that can be tapped at low temperature. Phase equilibria studies have been undertaken in the system "TiO 2 "-CaO/MgO-Al 2 O 3 SiO 2 at carbon saturation. Extensive experimental data are presented {{in the form of}} pseudoternary "TiO 2 "-(CaO+MgO) - (Al 2 O 3 +SiO 2) at fixedMgO/CaO and Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 ratios. Melting temperatures of complex slag are described as functions of <b>basicity</b> weight <b>ratio</b> (CaO+MgO) /(SiO 2 +Al 2 O 3) and TiOx concentration. The phase diagrams determined in this study explain the behaviour of titanium-containing slag such as Panzhihua ironmaking slag. These diagrams will be used for selection of optimum slag composition with low liquidus temperature for both Ti-free and Ticontaining slag. The possibility of lowering ironmaking temperature by adding titania has been discussed based on the experimental data determined in this study. A large amount of iron blast furnace slag containing 20 - 25 wt% "TiO 2 " are produced in Panzhihua Iron & Steel. "TiO 2 " has to be concentrated before it can be efficiently extracted from the slag. It was found in this study that titanium is present in the blast furnace slag mainly in two minerals, perovskite CaTiO 3 and pseudobrookite (Mg 2 +,Al 3 +,Ti 3 +,Ti 4 +) 3 O 5. Electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA) has been used to determine phase assemblage of the slag quenched from high temperature and the compositions of the phases. It was found that "TiO 2 " is 58 wt% in perovskite and 80 - 90 wt% in pseudobrookite. The particle size of the pseudobrookite is much larger than that of the perovskite. It was found that the composition of the current Panzhihua ironmaking slag is located in the perovskite primary phase field. The maximum "TiO 2 " concentration in the recovered materials is only 58 wt% if the crystal phase is perovskite. With the information provided in this study {{it may be possible to}} recover "TiO 2 " from the Panzhihua slag in the form of pseudobrookite so that recovered materials contains 80 - 90 wt% "TiO 2 " and can be used directly for production of pure TiO 2...|$|R

Masood 1, 2, M. A. Reuter 3 1 Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia 2 Wealth from Waste Research Cluster, Australia 3 Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology, Germany *Corresponding author: ARhamdhani@swin. edu. au ABSTRACT The {{distribution}} ratio of germanium (Ge), LGe /, during equilibrium reactions between magnesia saturated FeOx-CaO-SiO 2 (FCS) slag and molten copper has been measured under oxygen partial pressures from 10 - 10 to 10 - 7 atm and at temperatures 1473 to 1623 K (1200 to 1350 oC). It was {{observed that the}} Ge {{distribution ratio}} increases with increasing oxygen partial pressure, and with decreasing temperature. It was also observed that the distribution ratio is strongly dependant on slag <b>basicity.</b> The distribution <b>ratio</b> was observed to increase with increasing optical basicity. At fixed CaO concentration in the slag, the distribution ratio was found to increase with increasing Fe/SiO 2 ratio, tending to a plateau at LGe / = 0. 8. This behaviour {{is consistent with the}} assessment of ionic bond fraction carried out in this study, and suggested the acidic nature of germanium oxide (GeO 2) in the slag system studied. The characterisation results of the quenched slag suggested that Ge is present in the FeOx-CaO- SiO 2 -MgO slag predominantly as GeO 2. At 1573 K (1300 oC) and pO 2 = 10 - 8 atm, the activity coefficient of GeO 2 in the slag was calculated to be in the range of 0. 24 to 1. 50. The results from the current study suggested that less-basic slag, high operating temperature, and low oxygen partial pressure promote a low Ge distribution ratio. These conditions are desired for maximising Ge recovery, for example during pyrometallurgical processing of Ge-containing e-waste through secondary copper smelting. Overall, the thermodynamics data generated from this study can be used for process modelling purposes for improving recovery of Ge in primary and secondary copper smelting processes...|$|R
