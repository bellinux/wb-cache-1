5|$|After {{the deadly}} {{incident}} on the New Texas Giant on July 19, 2013, and <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> rides share several similarities, Six Flags Fiesta Texas had ceased running Iron Rattler pending investigation findings from its sister park.

5|$|As B.menziesii is not {{similar to}} any other Banksia, hybrids are {{unlikely}} to occur. The only reported hybrid is a sterile hybrid with B.hookeriana (Hooker's banksia), found north of Badgingarra by Greg Keighery. Manual cross-fertilisation with B.attenuata has resulted in germination, indicating that these two species are genetically compatible, but natural hybrids are extremely unlikely <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> species flower at different times.|$|E
5|$|Within {{rotavirus}} A {{there are}} different strains, called serotypes. As with influenza virus, a dual classification system is used based on two proteins {{on the surface of}} the virus. The glycoprotein VP7 defines the G serotypes and the protease-sensitive protein VP4 defines P serotypes. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> genes that determine G-types and P-types can be passed on separately to progeny viruses, different combinations are found.|$|E

5|$|From 1254 to 1257, Edward {{was under}} the {{influence}} of his mother's relatives, known as the Savoyards, the most notable of whom was Peter of Savoy, the queen's uncle. After 1257, Edward increasingly fell in with the Poitevin or Lusignan faction – the half-brothers of his father HenryIII – led by such men as William de Valence. This association was significant, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> groups of privileged foreigners were resented by the established English aristocracy, and they would be at the centre of the ensuing years' baronial reform movement. There were tales of unruly and violent conduct by Edward and his Lusignan kinsmen, which raised questions about the royal heir's personal qualities. The next years would be formative on Edward's character.|$|E
5|$|In the 1992–93 tournament, Derby County {{lost the}} final 3–1 to Cremonese. Brescia won the final in 1994 against Notts County, but Notts County reached the final again in 1995 and {{defeated}} Ascoli 2–1. The last instalment {{of the competition}} was held in 1995–96, and Genoa triumphed 5–2 over Port Vale in the final on 17 March 1996. The competition was abandoned in 1996 <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> leagues could not agree on dates for fixtures, and due to increasing violence at matches.|$|E
5|$|Janszoon did {{not detect}} the {{existence}} of Torres Strait, which separates Australia and New Guinea. Unknown to the Dutch, the Spanish or Portuguese explorer Luis Váez de Torres, working for the Spanish Crown, sailed through the strait only four months later. However, Torres did not report seeing the coast of a major land mass to his south and is therefore presumed not to have seen Australia. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> separate observations of Janzoon and Torres were not matched, Dutch maps {{did not include the}} strait until after James Cook's 1770 passage through the Torres Strait, while early Spanish maps showed the coast of New Guinea correctly, but omitted Australia.|$|E

5|$|Peckinpah {{originally}} wanted actor Jack Palance to {{play the}} role of Rudy Butler but could not afford his salary. Impressed by his performance in The Panic in Needle Park (1971), Hill recommended Richard Bright. Bright had worked with McQueen fourteen years before, but he did not have the threatening physique that McQueen pictured for Butler <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> men were the same height. Due to his friendship with Bright, Peckinpah cast him as the con man. Al Lettieri was brought to Peckinpah's attention for the role of Butler by producer Albert S. Ruddy, who was working with the actor on The Godfather (1972). Like Peckinpah, Lettieri was a heavy drinker, which caused problems while filming due to his unpredictable behavior.|$|E
5|$|The {{biggest problem}} {{faced by the}} MAUD Committee {{was to find a}} way to {{separate}} the 0.7% of uranium-235 from the 99.3% of uranium-238. This is difficult <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> types of uranium are chemically identical. Separation (uranium enrichment) would have to be achieved at a large scale. At Cambridge, Eric Rideal and his team investigated using a gas centrifuge. Frisch chose to perform gaseous thermal diffusion using Clusius tubes because it seemed the simplest method. Frisch's calculations showed there would need to be 100,000 Clusius tubes to extract the desired separation amount. Peierls turned to Franz Simon, who preferred to find a method more suitable for mass production.|$|E
5|$|The {{move was}} {{initially}} blocked by UEFA <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> teams were in different countries. However Total Network Solutions appealed and UEFA reviewed Oswestry Town's historic {{membership of the}} Football Association of Wales. Director Richaerd Hann also argued the precedence of Derry City F.C. being based in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland but playing in the Republic of Ireland's League of Ireland and being allowed to represent the Republic of Ireland in UEFA competitions. As a result, the decision was overturned and UEFA stated that they would regard The New Saints and Park Hall as Welsh for UEFA purposes if they moved to Park Hall. Park Hall was purchased from the council by Mike Harris {{with a view to}} renovating it.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{extending}} the Holmenkollen Line from Majorstuen {{to the city}} center had started in 1901. The process had been delayed several times because of disagreements between {{the city and the}} company, in part <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> could not agree if it should be classified as a railway or a tramway. Construction started in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and the company could not agree on the location of the terminus. The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien, but this would make it difficult for the company to build the tunnel through the city center to connect to the suburban tramways east of the city center. Construction was stopped in October 1914.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} of Ombifotsy was ruled by Andriambahoakafovoanitany, {{who had a}} friendly relationship with Andriamasinavalona. The two agreed to a challenge: each would leave his palace simultaneously on a chosen Friday night, and walk toward the other's palace until the two met. They crossed paths at the Ombifotsy ("White Zebu") river, so named <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> sacrificed a white zebu there in honor of their friendship and the peace agreement between their two territories of Imamo and Imerina. Andriambahoakafovoanitany's son dug a trench along the river, where he erected a stone to commemorate the agreement. Imamo was divided into four parts, each administered by one of Andriambahoakafovoanitany's sons.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a long-standing}} {{practice}} of writing transliterations of the runes in Latin characters in boldface and transcribing the text into a normalized {{form of the}} language with italic type. This practice exists <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> forms of rendering a runic text have to be kept distinct. By not only showing the original inscription, but also transliterating, transcribing and translating, scholars present the analysis {{in a way that}} allows the reader to follow their interpretation of the runes.

5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{uncertainty about the}} identities of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania between Traidenis' death in 1282 and Vytenis' assumption of power in 1295. This is in part <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> main sources for Lithuanian history in the 13th century, the Hypatian Codex and the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, end in the early 1290s. In 1285, one chronicle mentions Daumantas as Grand Duke. He attacked the Bishop of Tver and was severely wounded or even killed in the battle. However, that is the only information about him.|$|E
5|$|Because his Nung {{soldiers}} were exhausted, with their ammunition and water supplies running low, White believed {{they could not}} defend the Ngok Tavak garrison in case the VC launched another major attack. At 10:45, White requested permission to evacuate the garrison, but {{he was told to}} stay and wait for the arrival of reinforcements. However, both White and Makowski knew that reinforcement was unlikely, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> downed helicopters would prevent the insertion of additional soldiers, and the road between Ngok Tavak and Khâm Đức was likely to be covered by the opposing forces waiting in ambush positions. White then decided to evacuate Ngok Tavak and withdraw his troops to safety. As part of the evacuation plan, any type of equipment that could not be taken or was considered to be of value to the opponent was dumped into the command bunker and set alight using captured enemy flamethrowers. The Marines were ordered to fire their last remaining shells, about nine rounds in total, after their ammunition storage was set ablaze by the VC, and disable their 105mm guns.|$|E
5|$|Both VAT and SAT were criticised in 1954 {{by heavy}} vehicle {{importers}} <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> companies {{had access to}} {{a large share of}} the limited foreign currency reserves for component supply. The importers' representatives said neither Sisu nor Vanaja were very domestic products and the vehicles the importers represented were actually more domestic because some assembly work was done in Finland. According to the Association of Vehicle Importers, the domestic vehicles cost between 30% and 80% more compared to imported ones. The following year, the government started to investigate possibilities for importing heavy vehicles in kit form to reduce foreign-currency expenditure. VAT and SAT expressed doubts about the viability of such production. In 1957, the government ended restrictions on the import of heavy vehicle chassis. Eventually, the prices of imported vehicles approached those of Sisu and Vanaja vehicles.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Pablo Jayat {{and colleagues}} {{reviewed}} {{the members of}} the Akodon boliviensis group in Argentina. On the basis of sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, they found A.caenosus to be closest to A.lutescens and A.subfuscus, forming a clade that was the sister group to a clade of the remaining species in the A.boliviensis group—A.boliviensis, A.spegazzinii, A.sylvanus, and A.polopi. They classified A.caenosus as a species separate from A.lutescens <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> forms did not form a single clade (A.caenosus was instead closer to A.subfuscus), and because the difference between the cytochrome b sequences of A.lutescens and A.caenosus was relatively high at 3.5%. A.aliquantulus was reduced to a synonym of A.caenosus, because they found no substantial morphometrical differentiation between the two and could not replicate the characters Díaz and colleagues had noted as diagnostic for A.aliquantulus.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines {{were unable}} to respond {{effectively}} to the Muslim advance in Africa, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> decades between 695 and 715 were a period of great domestic turmoil. They did react with raids of their own in the East, {{such as the one}} in 709 against Egypt which captured the local admiral, but they also were aware of a coming onslaught: as Caliph al-Walid I (705–715) readied his forces for a renewed assault against Constantinople, Emperor Anastasios II (713–715) prepared the capital, and mounted an unsuccessful pre-emptive strike against the Muslim naval preparations. Anastasios was soon overthrown by Theodosius III (715–717), who in turn was replaced, just as the Muslim army was advancing through Anatolia, by Leo III the Isaurian (717–741). It was Leo III who faced the second and final Arab siege of Constantinople. The use of Greek fire, which devastated the Arab fleet, was again instrumental in the Byzantine victory, while a harsh winter and Bulgar attacks further sapped the besiegers' strength.|$|E
5|$|Without seismic data or {{knowledge}} of its moment of inertia, little direct {{information is available}} about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus. The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth, the Venusian core is at least partially liquid <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> planets have been cooling {{at about the same}} rate. The slightly smaller size of Venus means pressures are 24% lower in its deep interior than Earth's. The principal difference between the two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is too strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous. This results in reduced heat loss from the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack of an internally generated magnetic field.|$|E
