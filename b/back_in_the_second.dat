5|$|Hull were Third Division runners-up in 2003–04 and League One runners-up in 2004–05; these {{back-to-back}} promotions {{took them}} into the Championship, the second tier of English football. The 2005–06 season, the club's first <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> tier, saw Hull finish in 18th place, 10points clear of relegation and their highest league finish for 16 years.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{first game}} of the season was at home against Central Florida on August 31. In a game that saw the debut of quarterback Marcus Vick, brother of former star Hokie Michael Vick, 10th-ranked Virginia Tech pulled out to an early lead before Central Florida fought <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> half. Tech recovered, however, and won the game, 48–29. Virginia Tech {{followed}} the victory with five others. On October 11, a fourth-ranked Hokie squad easily won against Syracuse University, 51–7, giving Virginia Tech a 6–0 record.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Test at Trent Bridge, Woodfull struck 26 and two. Australia led by 106 {{on the first}} innings and {{although}} Woodfull was so concerned with batting England out of the match that he declared with less than five hours remaining on the final day, his men {{went on to win}} by 238 runs, albeit with only ten minutes of play remaining. England struck <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> Test at Lord's. Woodfull made 22 as Australia replied to England's 440 with 284. The hosts enforced the follow on as rain breathed life into the pitch, and Woodfull made 43 as Australia were all out for 118 in an innings defeat.|$|E

5|$|Lyall's successor, George Burley, {{was unable}} to turn team {{performances}} around, and Ipswich suffered a Premiership record defeat, 9–0, at Manchester United, {{on their way to}} relegation. <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> tier of the league, Burley led the club to three consecutive promotion playoffs, but they were to endure defeats in all three semi-finals. Ipswich finally returned to the Premiership in 2000 after coming from behind to beat Barnsley 4–2 in the last Division One playoff final at Wembley Stadium. Ipswich performed well in the Premiership in their first season with Burley's side finishing in an impressive fifth place—being pipped by Liverpool {{on the last day of}} the season for a place in the Champions League. Consolation was a UEFA Cup place and FA Premier League Manager of the Year Award for Burley.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes hit <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> {{session on}} Friday night, with Nico Rosberg leading his {{teammate}} Lewis Hamilton {{by about a}} tenth of a second. The Ferraris were about half a second behind, with Räikkönen again the faster of the two. It was another dismal session for Jenson Button who had to park his car halfway through the session, though he was able to come back for a couple of laps {{towards the end of the}} session. A late red flag came out when Vettel, braking slowly into turn one, was clipped by the Force India of Sergio Pérez, taking off part of his front wing endplate.|$|E
5|$|Bulldogs battled the Dayton Triangles in week five. The Bulldogs {{opened the}} scoring {{in the first}} quarter on a two-yard rushing {{touchdown}} by Pete Calac. But the Triangles came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> quarter, scoring twice: back Frank Bacon had a four-yard rushing touchdown, and end Dave Reese had a 50-yard receiving touchdown. Guyon scored a 22-yard rushing touchdown during the corner, but the extra point sailed wide. In the third quarter, the Triangles responded with a 3-yard rushing touchdown by back Lou Partlow, but Dayton missed the extra point to make the score 20–14. Thorpe then came into the game, and kicked a 45-yard field goal to bring his team within three points. In the final minutes, Thorpe kicked another 35-yard field goal to tie it. The Triangles were the first team to score on the Bulldogs since the opening game of the previous year.|$|E
25|$|As he grew {{close to}} al-Solh in 1945, Saad was {{accepted}} into the security forces as a police officer.

5|$|By 1930, {{the college}} 1st VIII had reached its highest {{position}} on the river for thirty years. In 1947, the college chaplain Leslie Cross presented {{a new set of}} oars to the club. He retired that year, and the college magazine, noting that Cross had been a particularly generous supporter of the club, stated that the oars had already been used to good purpose. The 1st VIII progressed further in the 1950s, making five bumps in 1951 and four in 1952 to reach the first division, with a high point of seventh in 1957. It later returned to the second division, before re-entering the first division in 1970. Its highest position in recent years was seventh in the first division in 2000; it has been <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> division since 2004, and finished eighth in the second division in 2011.|$|E
5|$|In week five, the Triangles battled the Canton Bulldogs, {{who had the}} Hall-of-Fame back Jim Thorpe.

5|$|The 2008–09 {{campaign}} was Leicester's first season outside {{the top two}} levels of English football, but they hit this nadir only seven years before becoming the 2015–16 Premier League champions, the fastest seven-year {{rise to the top}} of the English football league system apart from Ipswich Town in 1962. Following relegation to the third tier the previous season, Leicester returned to the Championship at the first attempt in 2008–09, finishing as champions of League One after a 2–0 win at Southend United, with two matches in hand. The 2009–10 season saw Leicester's revival under manager Nigel Pearson continue, as the club finished fifth and reached the Championship play-offs in their first season <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> tier. Though coming from 2–0 down on aggregate, away to Cardiff City, to briefly lead 3–2, they eventually lost to a penalty shoot-out in the play-off semi-final. At the end of the season, Pearson left Leicester to become the manager of Hull City, claiming he felt the club seemed reluctant to keep him, and that Paulo Sousa had been the club's guest at both play-off games, hinting at a possible replacement. On 7 July 2010, Sousa was confirmed as Pearson's replacement.|$|E
2500|$|Kérékou {{reclaimed}} <b>the</b> presidency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> March 1996 election. Soglo's {{economic reforms}} and his alleged dictatorial tendencies had caused his popularity to suffer. Although Kérékou received fewer votes than Soglo <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first round, he then defeated Soglo <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> round, taking 52.5% of the vote. Kérékou was <b>backed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> round by third place candidate Adrien Houngbédji and fourth place candidate Bruno Amoussou; as in 1991, Kérékou received very {{strong support from}} northern voters, but he also improved his performance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south. Soglo alleged fraud, but this {{was rejected by the}} Constitutional Court, which confirmed Kérékou's victory. When taking the oath of office, Kérékou left out a portion that referred to the [...] "spirits of the ancestors" [...] because he had become a born-again Christian after his defeat by Soglo. He was subsequently forced to retake the oath including the reference to spirits.|$|R

25|$|In 1978 Boyns {{had plenty}} of first-team {{opportunities}} from late May to early July, {{but on the whole}} did not make the most of them. His highest score during this period was 41*, and though he claimed a List A career-best of 4–34 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> John Player League against Leicestershire he was soon <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seconds</b> yet again. Here, as they had on several previous occasions, the runs flowed, with scores of 105*, 87 and 78* leading to his recall. He made 71 against <b>the</b> New Zealanders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> half of August, but little else was worthy of note. By 1979 Boyns' days as a Worcestershire cricketer were numbered, and indeed he made only one first-class appearance that summer, against <b>the</b> Sri Lankans <b>in</b> mid-July, although he did play six times in one-day matches. His last first-class wicket was that of Sri Lankan Roy Dias, while his last List A scalp was Sussex's Tony Pigott just a few days later.|$|R
5|$|The Tigers led the AL Central {{for periods}} {{at the start}} of the season in April, {{ultimately}} tying for the lead on May 10 and taking the lead outright on May 16. The Tigers held at least a share of the divisional lead from then onwards, holding their largest lead of 7 games on September 6. Although the Tigers went 16–12 in September, their second-best month by winning percentage in 2009, they won just 1 of 4 games in October. The Twins went 16–11 and 4–0, respectively, over this same stretch to tie the Tigers for the divisional lead after the 162-game regular season. More broadly, the Tigers were 48–39 over the first half of the season while the Twins were 45–44 but the Twins came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> half going 41–32 leading up to the tie-breaker while the Tigers went 38–37 over the same span. The Twins won 11 of the two teams' 18 match-ups that season prior to the tie-breaker.|$|E
5|$|The game, {{which was}} the sixth edition of the bowl, was {{expected}} to be an offensive shootout. Boise State averaged 42.4points during the 2007 season, while East Carolina averaged 31. That expectation turned out to be justified as East Carolina took a 31–14 lead in the first half. The Broncos fought <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> half, however, tying the score at 38 late in the fourth quarter after East Carolina's Chris Johnson fumbled the ball, allowing Bronco defender Marty Tadman to recover the ball and return it 47yards for a touchdown. The game remained tied until the final moments as East Carolina's Ben Hartman made a 34–yard game-winning field goal as time expired. The attendance of 30,467 was the largest crowd to attend a Hawaii Bowl game that did not feature the host school. Boise State's loss dropped them to a final 2007 record of 10–3, while East Carolina's final-game win earned them a record of 8–5.|$|E
5|$|Then the Colts faced their arch-rival New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. New England {{jumped to}} an early 21–3 lead, but Indianapolis stormed <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> half, outscoring the Patriots 32–13 with an {{additional}} field goal {{late in the first}} half. With 2:22 left in the game, the Colts had the ball on their own 20-yard line trailing 34–31. On the first four plays of the drive, Manning completed three passes, moving the ball 69yards to the Patriots 11-yard line in just 24 seconds. Three plays later, Addai scored a 3-yard touchdown run to put them in the lead, 38–34 with only 60 seconds left in regulation. The Patriots responded with a drive to the Colts 45-yard line, but defensive back Marlin Jackson ended the drive with an interception to give Indianapolis the win. This happened to be the biggest comeback in AFC-NFC Conference Championship history.|$|E
50|$|FC Goa {{lost four}} out of their first six matches but came <b>back</b> {{strongly}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> half of <b>the</b> tournament with five victories from their last eight encounters keeping five clean sheets in their 14 matches.

5|$|Cleveland next {{faced the}} Yankees {{at home in}} a rematch of the {{previous}} year's title game. The crowd of 80,067 was the second-largest in professional football history at the time. More people were turned away at the gates because Cleveland Stadium was filled to capacity. New York scored first in the first quarter on a 47-yard field goal by Harvey Johnson, but Cleveland came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> quarter, putting up 17 points to lead 17–3 at halftime. New York came back and tied the game 17–17 in the third quarter. Graham responded with a touchdown throw to Speedie in the third quarter. The Yankees threatened a comeback in the final minutes when Lou Sossman blocked a Groza field goal try and New York recovered, advancing the ball to Cleveland's 25-yard line. Cleveland, however, took over on downs and ran down the clock to three minutes with a series of running plays, reaching New York's 35-yard line. Groza then attempted a field goal that fell short, but the Yankees were called offside, and Groza successfully booted his next try through, giving Cleveland a 26–17 victory. The Browns had 14 first downs to New York's 11 and rushed for 212 yards, compared to 111 for the Yankees. Graham had 11 completions for 161 passing yards despite being sacked five times for 72 yards of losses.|$|E
5|$|Docherty rebuilt {{confidence}} in the team and Villa {{went on to win}} five consecutive games and retained a place in the Second Division. In the short time that Docherty had been at the club, attendances rose significantly from a low of just over 12,000 against Charlton Athletic in December. In the summer of 1969 the first share issue since 1896 raised £200,000 for the club, £140,000 of which was spent on new players. In the following season, however, Villa took ten games to register a win. By Christmas 1969, Villa were {{at the bottom of the}} Second Division and Docherty was sacked. His successor, Vic Crowe, was unable to prevent Aston Villa from being relegated to the third tier of English football for the first time in its history in the 196970 season. Despite finishing fourth in the Third Division in the 197071 season, Villa reached the League Cup final after beating Manchester United in the semi-final. They were defeated in the final by Tottenham Hotspur 20. The 197172 season saw the club return to the Second Division as champions with a then divisional record 70 points. They were invited to take part in the 1972 FA Charity Shield but lost 1–0 to Manchester City. In the autumn of 1972, there was a revolt in the boardroom and four of the five directors voted to oust Doug Ellis from the board. Within 43days though, Ellis was reinstated as chairman after he received the support of the largest shareholder Pat Matthews, and the supporters at an EGM, who also voted to replace the existing directors. Their first season <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> Division in 197273 saw Villa narrowly miss out on a second successive promotion when they finished third. However, the following season Villa finished 14th and Ellis sacked Crowe, replacing him with Ron Saunders.|$|E

50|$|The Seahawks {{traveled}} to Charlotte {{to face the}} #1 seeded Carolina Panthers. The Panthers scored early and often <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first half, going into halftime with a 31-0 lead. The Seahawks fought <b>back</b> aggressively <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> half, cutting <b>the</b> lead to only one possession and holding the Panthers from scoring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> half, but fell short of a victory after the Panthers successfully recovered an onside kick and kneeled out the clock, with a final score of 31-24.|$|R

25|$|The {{first two}} seasons <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> Division saw Rovers finish a {{credible}} 13th place, their highest in the league since the 1950s.
