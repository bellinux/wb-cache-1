The {{purpose of this study}} was to clarify the weak point of the side-to-side anastomosis and to evaluate the effect of bioabsorbable reinforcement material. Methods: Fresh pig small bowel was used for all experiments. A side-to-side anastomosis was performed using a linear stapler, and the <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> of the anastomosis was measured. Three separate experiments were done. In experiment 1, the weak point and the <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> of that point were defined. In experiment 2, the <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> of the side of the anastomosis was measured. In experiment 3, we evaluated the effect of Neoveil® to strengthen the weak point of the anastomosis. Results: The weak point of the side-to side anastomosis was the crotch and the <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> was 39. 8  ±  5. 7  mmHg. The <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> of the side of the anastomosis was 109. 9  ±  7. 9  mmHg. This was significantly higher than the <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> of the crotch (P =  0. 008). The <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> of the crotch in the group with Neoveil® was 83. 3  ±  14. 9  mmHg. This pressure was significantly higher than the group with no Neoveil® reinforcement (P =  0. 001). Conclusion: These findings suggest that the use of Neoveil® as a buttressing material is associated with reinforced staple lines and increased crotch <b>burst</b> <b>pressures</b> compared to non-buttressed staple lines. Neoveil® was found to perform comparably to clinically available buttress materials in this ex vivo model.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: During bowel surgery, {{perioperative}} {{blood loss}} and hypotension {{can lead to}} transient intestinal ischemia. Recent preclinical studies reveal that the strength of intestinal anastomoses can be compromised after reperfusion. So far, this phenomenon has not been investigated {{in the very first}} days of healing when wound strength is lowest. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Ischemia was induced in rats by clamping both the superior mesenteric artery and ileal branches for 30 min. Immediately after declamping, anastomoses were constructed in both terminal ileum and descending colon. The same was done in control groups after sham-ischemia. Anastomotic <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> and breaking strength were measured immediately after operation (day 0) and after 1, 2, or 3 days. Anastomotic hydroxyproline content, gelatinase activity, and histology were analyzed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In ileal anastomoses, at day 1, both the breaking strength and <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> were significantly (p < 0. 05) lower in the ischemic group, while at day 2, this was the case for the <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> only. In the colon, the <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> in the ischemic group was lower at day 1. Anastomotic hydroxyproline content remained unchanged. Increased presence of the various gelatinase activities was found in ileum only at day 0 and in colon at days 1 and 2. Histological mucosal damage was found in ischemia-reperfusion groups. CONCLUSION: Transient mesenteric ischemia can negatively affect anastomotic strength during the very first days of healing, even if the tissue used for anastomotic construction looks vital...|$|E
40|$|Background and aims: While {{mechanical}} parameters (breaking strength, <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure)</b> {{are used}} to measure colonic anastomotic healing, reported values are inconsistent. This study developed a novel approach to study colonic anastomotic repair and compared it with mechanical methods. Methods and materials: We created standardized four- and eight-suture colonic anastomoses and performed contrast enemas in rats. Results: All eight-suture anastomoses were tight at completion. In contrast, all four-suture anastomoses leaked immediately after the operation, but the integrity increased progressively, and at 12 h all were closed. No changes in breaking strength were observed up to 3 days postoperatively, in contrast to anastomotic <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> which increased progressively over the same period. Integrity and <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> increased in parallel to the anastomotic content of myeloperoxidase (MPO), indicating that neutrophil infiltration is not detrimental in normal healing. Moreover, local irradiation, which enhanced MPO activity, did not increase leakage, suggesting that neutrophil accumulation per se {{has no effect on}} the integrity of colonic anastomosis. In addition, administration of 5 -fluorouracil, which decreased anastomotic MPO levels, increased anastomotic leakage. Conclusion: We present a novel approach to study anastomotic healing using radiological examination. While <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> appears to be suitable for measuring early anastomotic healing in the colon, we demonstrate that breaking strength is not sufficiently sensitive to be used in examination of early healing. Moreover, our data suggest that the acute inflammatory response and associated neutrophil recruitment in the anastomosis does not negatively affect healing in the rat colon...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundBecause {{of the low}} patency rate of {{currently}} available vascular bypass grafts, researchers are working towards the development of alternative bypass grafts, ranging from synthetic prostheses to wholly biologic living grafts. The philosophy of measurement required by regulatory {{agencies such as the}} United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as to gain the Conformité Européene (CE) mark is to test above and beyond the limits that would be expected physiologically. The critical parameter of <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> is needed for Conformité Européene (CE) mark or United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval before clinical trials can proceed. An accurate measurement of <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> in potential porous vascular bypass grafts is, therefore, of utmost importance to ensure adequate strength on implantation in animals and subsequent clinical use. A wide range of methods to measure <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> have been used. We tested the <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> of a new polyurethane-based nanocomposite vascular prosthesis by using different methods to assess whether the method used affected the results. MethodsWater was infused at flow rates of 0. 2, 50, and 100 mL/min through a syringe pump into latex sleeve–lined porous prostheses manufactured from a poly(carbonate-urea) urethane nanocomposite incorporating silsesquioxane. At the lowest infusion rate, the inflation was done with and without a nonporous inner lining sleeve. A pressure transducer was used to record the peak pressure achieved. ResultsUsing a nonporous sleeve resulted in a higher <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> (428 mm Hg vs 341 mm Hg) at a flow rate of 0. 2 mL/min. A lower infusion rate (0. 2 mL/min) produced a lower <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> than 50 mL/min (428 mm Hg vs 451 mm Hg). No significant difference was found in <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> using infusion rates of 50 mL/min and 100 mL/min. ConclusionsThe use of a nonporous sleeve removes the potential weakness presented by the pores themselves. A continuous high infusion rate consistently overestimates <b>burst</b> <b>pressure.</b> These methods may not reflect the physiologic state. Care needs to be taken in interpretation of methodology for <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement, and the rate of infusion should be stated in any description of the method. Clinical RelevanceThe poor patency of small-caliber vascular bypass prostheses has stimulated a large body of research into alternative graft materials. This includes synthetic and, more recently, tissue-engineered hybrid products. Acceptance for international standards requires demonstration of a rigorous mechanical testing regimen, including graft strength, which has on the whole involved burst strength measurement. However, the methods used to measure burst strength have varied with respect to apparatus used and rate of graft inflation. We show that these variables lead to markedly different results. In particular, fast infusion rates may overestimate the actual <b>burst</b> <b>pressure,</b> leading to a false sense of security...|$|R

However, how to precisely determine if the bowel can withstand the pressure of a colorectal anastomosis experiment, which is called anastomotic <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure,</b> has not been determined. MethodA task force developed the experimental animal hollow organ mechanical testing system to provide precise measurement of the maximum pressure that an anastomotic colon can withstand, and to compare it with the commonly used method such as the mercury and air bag pressure manometer in a rat colon rupture pressure test. Forty-five male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into the manual ball manometry (H) group, the tracing machine manometry pressure gauge head (MP) group, and the experimental animal hollow organ mechanical testing system (ME) group. The rats in each group were subjected to a cut colon rupture pressure test after injecting anesthesia in the tail vein. Colonic end-to-end anastomosis was performed, and the rats were rested for 1 week before anastomotic <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> was determined by one of the three methods.

Thirty-six male Wistar rats were divided into two equal groups: control (group A), and irradiation group (group B). Group B received a single 500 -cGy dose of irradiation, and a rectal resection and end-to-end anastomosis was performed in both groups on the 7 th day after irradiation. Parameters of the healing process included <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> and collagen content on the 5 th, 7 th, and 14 th days after surgery. In the irradiation group, the mean <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> on the 5 th, 7 th, and 14 th days was 116, 218, and 273 mmHg, respectively.

In contrast, the control group had a mean <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> of 175, 225 and 263 mmHg, and a collagen content of 17. 8, 28. 1, and 32. 1 %, respectively.

40|$|In this paper, {{the stress}} rupture {{reliability}} of Carbon/Epoxy Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPVs) is examined utilizing the classic Phoenix model and {{accounting for the}} differences between the design and the actual <b>burst</b> <b>pressure,</b> and the liner contribution effects. Stress rupture life primarily depends upon the fiber stress ratio which is defined as the ratio of stress in fibers at the maximum expected operating pressure to actual delivered fiber strength. The actual delivered fiber strength is calculated using the actual <b>burst</b> <b>pressures</b> of vessels established through burst tests. However, during the design phase the actual <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> is generally not known and to estimate the reliability of the vessels calculations are usually performed based upon the design <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> only. Since the design burst is lower than the actual burst, this process yields a much higher value for the stress ratio and consequently a conservative estimate for the reliability. Other complications arise {{due to the fact that}} the actual <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> and the liner contributions have inherent variability and therefore must be treated as random variables in order to compute the stress rupture reliability. Furthermore, the model parameters, which have to be established based on stress rupture tests of subscale vessels or coupons, have significant variability as well due to limited available data and hence must be properly accounted for. In this work an assessment of reliability of COPVs including both parameter uncertainties and physical variability inherent in liner and overwrap material behavior is made and estimates are provided in terms of degree of uncertainty in the actual <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> and the liner load sharing...|$|R

Therefore the maximum hoop stress will be reduced, resulting more <b>burst</b> <b>pressure.</b> The analytical results of stress distribution and <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> is calculated and validated by ANSYS Workbench results...|$|R
40|$|Available {{industrial}} code such as ASME B 1 G, modified ASME B 1 G and DNV RP- F 101 {{to assess}} pipeline defects appear more conservative for multiple crack like- defects than single crack-like defects. Thus, {{this paper presents}} <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> prediction of pipe with multiple cracks like defects. A finite element model was developed and the <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> prediction was compared with the available code. The model was used to investigate {{the effect of the}} distance between the cracks and the crack length. The coalescence diagram was also developed to evaluate the <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> of the multiple crack. It was found as the distance between crack increases,the interaction effect comes to fade away and multiple cracks behave like two independent single cracks...|$|R
