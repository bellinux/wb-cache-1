40|$|Malignant {{melanoma}} is {{a highly}} aggressive tumor that frequently resists chemotherapy, so the search for new agents for its treatment is of great importance. In the present study, the antiproliferative propensity against human melanoma cell lines of lauroside B (1), a megastigmane glycoside isolated from Laurus nobilis (<b>bay</b> <b>laurel)</b> <b>leaves,</b> was investigated. This compound suppressed the proliferation of three human melanoma cell lines, namely, A 375, WM 115, and SK-Mel- 28. The 1 -induced inhibition of humanmelanoma cell proliferationwas due to the induction of apoptosis, as demonstrated by FACS analysiswith annexin V/PI staining and confirmed by activation of caspase- 3 and by the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Growing evidence implicates NF-κB as an important contributor to metastasis and increased chemoresistance of melanoma. Thus, {{it was hypothesized that}} 1 -induced apoptosis could be associatedwith suppressionofNF-κB activation. The results showed that exposure of human melanoma cells to 1 inhibited IκB-R degradation and constitutive NF-κB DNA-binding activity as well as the expression, regulated by NF-κB, of two antiapoptotic genes, XIAP and c-FLIP. Induction of apoptosis by 1 in human aggressive melanoma cell lines has a potential high biological value...|$|R
40|$|Phytophthora ramorum, an {{invasive}} pathogen and {{the causal}} agent of Sudden Oak Death, has become established in mixed-evergreen and redwood forests in coastal northern California. While oak and tanoak mortality {{is the most}} visible indication of P. ramorum’s presence, epidemics are largely driven {{by the presence of}} bay laurel (Umbellularia californica), a reservoir host that supports both prolific sporulation in the winter wet season and survival during the summer dry season. In order to better understand how over-summer survival of the pathogen contributes to variability in the severity of annual epidemics, we monitored the viability of P. ramorum leaf infections over three years along with coincident microclimate. The proportion of symptomatic <b>bay</b> <b>laurel</b> <b>leaves</b> that contained viable infections decreased during the first summer dry season and remained low for the following two years, likely due to the absence of conducive wet season weather during the study period. Over-summer survival of P. ramorum was positively correlated with high percent canopy cover, less negative bay leaf water potential and few days exceeding 30 uC but was not significantly different between mixed-evergreen and redwood forest ecosystems. Decreased summer survival of P. ramorum in exposed locations and during unusually hot summers likely contributes to the observed spatiotemporal heterogeneity of P. ramorum epidemics...|$|R
