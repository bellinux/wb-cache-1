Nonetheless, the outcome of the war has generally been considered a diplomatic victory for Prussia, which not only retained Silesia, but also compelled Austria to acknowledge its sovereignty in the province, forestalling any further Silesian Wars. More fundamentally, Prussia showed itself to <b>be</b> <b>credible</b> rival to Austria by successfully surviving intact what could have become a war of partition.|$|E

The report concludes that the Israeli soldiers deliberately shot at the family members, as they could not perceive any danger from the house, its occupants or the surroundings. The report bases its conclusion on the premise that the family, consisting of a man, a young and an elderly woman and three small girls, some of them waving white flags, stepped {{out of the house and}} stood still for several minutes waiting for instructions from the soldiers.|$|E

Lucas was not considered to <b>be</b> <b>credible,</b> as he was known to be in Florida when Cole was killed and has since been eliminated as a suspect for the murders of Alexander and Orange Socks. Because of the decomposition of the body, the victim was reconstructed, at first with a three-dimensional clay model and later with a digital method by the Louisiana State University FACES Lab. Once possible, DNA was eventually extracted from the victim's teeth that would be used to compare against missing persons.|$|E

The Muslim League had to succeed in this crucial test if its popular support of its demand for Pakistan was to <b>be</b> <b>credible.</b> In particular it had {{to succeed in the}} Punjab as there could be no Pakistan without that province. But in the Punjab's last elections held in 1937 the League had fared disastrously. It had put forward a mere seven candidates for the 85 Muslim seats and only two had been successful. One of those candidates, Raja Ghazanfar Ali Khan also deserted the Punjab Muslim League, so there was only one Successful candidate of Punjab Muslim League.|$|E
25|$|Unbeknownst to Kryuchkov and the KGB, while {{cataloging}} the documents, Mitrokin secretly {{took his}} own copies and immensely detailed notes of the documents which he smuggled to his dacha and hid under the floorboards. Mitrokhin {{made no attempt to}} contact any Western intelligence service during the Soviet Era. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union (in 1992) he traveled to Latvia with copies of material from the archive and walked into the American embassy in Riga. Central Intelligence Agency officers there did not consider him to <b>be</b> <b>credible,</b> concluding that the copied documents could be faked. He then went to the British embassy and a young diplomat there saw his potential and after a further appointment one month later with representatives of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) operations followed to retrieve the 25,000 pages of files hidden in his house, covering operations from {{as far back as the}} 1930s.|$|E
25|$|If, {{after the}} leader had {{selected}} its equilibrium quantity, the follower deviated from the equilibrium and chose some non-optimal quantity {{it would not}} only hurt itself, {{but it could also}} hurt the leader. If the follower chose a much larger quantity than its best response, the market price would lower and the leader's profits would be stung, perhaps below Cournot level profits. In this case, the follower could announce to the leader before the game starts that unless the leader chooses a Cournot equilibrium quantity, the follower will choose a deviant quantity that will hit the leader's profits. After all, the quantity chosen by the leader in equilibrium is only optimal if the follower also plays in equilibrium. The leader is, however, in no danger. Once the leader has chosen its equilibrium quantity, it would be irrational for the follower to deviate because it too would be hurt. Once the leader has chosen, the follower is better off by playing on the equilibrium path. Hence, such a threat by the follower would not <b>be</b> <b>credible.</b>|$|E

25|$|Since the Chinese state {{continues}} to exert {{a considerable amount}} of control over media, public support for domestic reporting has {{come as a surprise to}} many observers. Not much is known about the extent to which the Chinese citizenry believe the official statements of the CPC, nor about which media sources they perceive as credible and why. So far, research on the media in China has focused on the changing relationship between media outlets and the state during the reform era. Nor is much known about how China's changing media environment has affected the government's ability to persuade media audiences. Research on political trust reveals that exposure to the media correlates positively with support for the government in some instances, and negatively in others. The research has been cited as evidence that the Chinese public believes propaganda transmitted to them through the news media, but also that they disbelieve it. These contradictory results can be explained by realizing that ordinary citizens consider media sources to <b>be</b> <b>credible</b> to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the extent to which media outlets have undergone reform.|$|E
25|$|The Stackelberg and Cournot {{models are}} similar because in both {{competition}} is on quantity. However, as seen, {{the first move}} gives the leader in Stackelberg a crucial advantage. There is also the important assumption of perfect information in the Stackelberg game: the follower must observe the quantity chosen by the leader, otherwise the game reduces to Cournot. With imperfect information, the threats described above can <b>be</b> <b>credible.</b> If the follower cannot observe the leader's move, {{it is no longer}} irrational for the follower to choose, say, a Cournot level of quantity (in fact, that is the equilibrium action). However, it must be that there is imperfect information and the follower is unable to observe the leader's move because it is irrational for the follower not to observe if it can once the leader has moved. If it can observe, it will so that it can make the optimal decision. Any threat by the follower claiming that it will not observe even if it can is as uncredible as those above. This is an example of too much information hurting a player. In Cournot competition, it is the simultaneity of the game (the imperfection of knowledge) that results in neither player (ceteris paribus) being at a disadvantage.|$|E

Prior to the redesign, comparisons were made between Ellie and actress Ellen Page; in June 2013, Page accused Naughty Dog of [...] "ripping off [...] likeness". The team felt that Ellie was important for the game's marketing; Druckmann said that, when asked to move the image of Ellie {{from the front of the}} game's packaging to the back, [...] "everyone at Naughty Dog just flat-out refused".|$|E
