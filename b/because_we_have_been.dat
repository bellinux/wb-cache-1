2500|$|The pro-peace {{attitude}} {{of the people of}} the Soviet Union and People's China is not based on fear of war but on confidence in their theory and way of life. One Soviet trade unionist put the matter to us in this way. [...] "We are not afraid of war. We have been through it and survived its cruelties and horrors. We know that we can take it. Just <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> through it and suffered from it, we know how terrible war is. It wastes materials, but worse than that, it squanders human idealism, energy, wealth and life. Still worse, those of us who are trying to build a socialist society are diverted and preoccupied by war. We know from bitter experience that if we are to engage in socialist construction we cannot fight wars. War is a full-time occupation." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{review in}} Hong Kong Free Press responded that [...] "while Global Times and other reviewers have {{primarily}} directed their critiques at {{the likelihood of}} the film's events actually taking place, the film cannot be entirely interpreted as a prediction for the year 2025. Ten Years is not a forecast calculated via econometric modelling; it is simply a portrayal of the Hong Kong public's worst fears. Perhaps a more pertinent question raised by the film is why people have come to dread – rather than look forward to – the city’s future. The answer is probably <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shown no realistic alternative." [...] The same reviewer observed a message about belonging in Hong Kong: [...] "For example, Extras and Self-Immolator [...] portray mainland immigrants, South Asians and elderly characters without treating them as antagonists or resorting to stereotypes. The latter film even features a mixed-race relationship, advocating the idea that Hong Kong identity should be based on civic, not ethnic, factors." ...|$|E

60|$|I cannot {{understand}} why our {{people were so}} crazy. Even though Nathaniel and I were but lads, with no experience of adventure such as was before us, we could realize that unless a man plants he may not reap, and <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> hungry many a time in London town, we knew full well that when the season <b>had</b> passed there <b>was</b> {{like to be a}} famine among us.|$|R
60|$|The excuse ordinarily {{given for}} this {{practice}} was this--namely, {{that it came}} to us for good; we took it, and it only went as it came; we did not make it, and the like; as if, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> basely cheated by A, we were {{to be allowed to}} cheat B; or that because C had robbed our house, that therefore we might go and rob D.|$|R

60|$|We {{have not}} said much on this latter point hitherto, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> unwilling to {{overwhelm}} the reader with too sudden a disclosure of that marvellous magazine of power which was latent in our band of heroes; but we feel it to be our duty now to state that the negro sang his native melodies with such pathos that he frequently reduced, (perhaps we should say elevated), the unsophisticated Eskimos to floods of tears, and sometimes to convulsions of laughter. As, at Benjy's suggestion, he sometimes changed his moods abruptly, the tears often mingled with the convulsions, so as to produce some vivid illustrations of Eskimo hysteria.|$|E
60|$|This {{is partly}} mere mistake in us; we build brown brick walls, and wear brown coats, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> blunderingly taught to do so, {{and go on}} doing so mechanically. There is, however, also some cause for the change in our own tempers. On the whole, these are much sadder ages than the early ones; not sadder in a noble and deep way, but in a dim wearied way,--the way of ennui, and jaded intellect, and uncomfortableness of soul and body. The Middle Ages had their wars and agonies, but also intense delights. Their gold was dashed with blood; but ours is {{sprinkled}} with dust. Their life was inwoven with white and purple: ours is one seamless stuff of brown. Not that we are without apparent festivity, but festivity more or less forced, mistaken, embittered, incomplete--not of the heart. How wonderfully, since Shakspere's time, have we lost the power of laughing at bad jests! The very finish of our wit belies our gaiety.|$|E

5000|$|After it was {{acquired}} by Almi Pictures, the distributor opened the film in a larger-than-normal number of screens. Then-president Frank Moreno told Fangoria magazine, [...] "Superstition is an unrated horror film that normally only plays 45 to 50 theaters in the area. Why are <b>we</b> playing 70? <b>Because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> able to convince theater owners and other people that yes, there are those basic 50 theaters that will perform well, but we feel we will step over that line with this particular film." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{craft of}} politics," [...] he pointed out, [...] "makes but one inexorable demand upon her followers--the demand for unity. The amazing {{thing is that}} this is not {{generally}} realised. It seems the fashion, nowadays, to dissent from everything, to cultivate the ego in its narrowest sense rather than to try and reach out and grasp the hands of those around. The fault, I think, is in an over-developed theatrical sense, the desire which so many clever men have for individual notoriety. We Democrats have prospered <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> free from it. We have been able to sink our individual prejudices in our cause. That is because our cause has been great enough. We aim so high, we see so clearly, that it is rare indeed to find amongst us those individual differences which have been the ruin of every political party up to to-day. We have no Brown who will not serve with Smith, no Robinson who declines to be associated with Jones. We forget the small things which are repugnant to us in a fellowman, because of the great things which bind us together." ...|$|E
60|$|And so with us English. For {{hundreds}} of years we have been growing more and more free, {{and more and more}} well-governed, simply <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> acting on St. Paul's doctrine--obeying the powers that be, because they are ordained by God. It is the Englishman's respect for law, as a sacred thing, which he dare not break, which has made him, sooner or later, respected and powerful wherever he goes to settle in foreign lands; because foreigners can trust us to be just, and to keep our promises, and to abide by the laws which we have laid down. It is the English respect for law, as a sacred thing, which has made our armies among the bravest and the most successful on earth; because they know how to obey their officers, and are therefore able to fight and to endure as men should do. And as long as we hold to that belief we shall prosper at home and abroad, and become more and more free, and more and more strong; because we shall be united, helping each other, trusting each other, knowing what to expect of each other, because we all honour and obey the same laws.|$|E
60|$|We thus see, {{that the}} {{evidence}} as to variation afforded by animals and plants under domestication strikingly accords with that which we have proved to exist {{in a state of}} nature. And {{it is not at all}} surprising that it should be so, since all the species were in a state of nature when first domesticated or cultivated by man, and whatever variations occur must be due to purely natural causes. Moreover, on comparing the variations which occur in any one generation of domesticated animals with those which we know to occur in wild animals, we find no evidence of greater individual variation in the former than in the latter. The results of man's selection are more striking to us because we have always considered the varieties of each domestic animal to be essentially identical, while those which we observe in a wild state are held to be essentially diverse. The greyhound and the spaniel seem wonderful, as varieties of one animal produced by man's selection; while we think little of the diversities of the fox and the wolf, or the horse and the zebra, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> accustomed to look upon them as radically distinct animals, not as the results of nature's selection of the varieties of a common ancestor.|$|E

5000|$|Dunn's strict {{adherence}} to a single style of painting <b>has</b> <b>been</b> widely criticized, especially from within the Native American community. Celebrated Chiricahua Apache sculptor, Allan Houser said, [...] "she trained us all the same way... Her style lacked originality and creativity."

5000|$|Mike Dailly, {{programmer}} at DMA Design, recounted that [...] "Lemmings 3 was … more to end {{our commitment}} to Psygnosis than actually do a good game.

60|$|The {{train of}} thought we have been {{following}} gives us a key to all these positions, without stepping aside to justify them on their own ground. It is <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> disgusted fifty times with physical squalls and fifty times torn between conflicting impulses, that we teach people this indirect and tactical procedure in life, and to judge by remote consequences instead of the immediate face of things. The very desire to act as our own souls would have us, coupled with a pathetic disbelief in ourselves, moves us to {{follow the example of}} others; perhaps, who knows? they may be on the right track; and the more our patterns are in number, the better seems the chance; until, if we be acting in concert with a whole civilised nation, there are surely a majority of chances that we must be acting right. And again, how true it is that we can never behave as we wish in this tormented sphere, and can only aspire to different and more favourable circumstances, in order to stand out and be ourselves wholly and rightly! And yet once more, if in the hurry and pressure of affairs and passions you tend to nod and become drowsy, here are twenty-four hours of Sunday set apart for you to hold counsel with your soul and look around you on the possibilities of life.|$|E
60|$|The {{woman of}} the house with a smile showed him into Mrs Hurtle's sitting-room, and he at once {{perceived}} that the smile was intended to welcome him as an accepted lover. It was a smile half of congratulation to the lover, half of congratulation to herself as a woman that another man had been caught by the leg and made fast. Who does not know the smile? What man, who has been caught and made sure, has not felt a certain dissatisfaction at being so treated, understanding that the smile is intended to convey to him a sense of his own captivity? It has, however, generally mattered but little to us. If we have felt that something of ridicule was intended, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> regarded as cocks with their spurs cut away, then we also have a pride when we have declared to ourselves that upon the whole we have gained more than we have lost. But with Paul Montague at the present moment there was no satisfaction, no pride,--only a feeling of danger which every hour became deeper, and stronger, with less chance of escape. He was almost tempted at this moment to detain the woman, and tell her the truth,--and bear the immediate consequences. But there would be treason in doing so, and he would not, could not do it.|$|E
60|$|This tenth night seemed {{longer than}} any of the others, and of course it <b>was</b> the hardest, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> accumulating fatigue from the beginning, and had more of it on hand now than at any {{previous}} time. But we were not molested again. When the dull dawn came at last we saw a river before us and we knew it was the Loire; we entered the town of Gien, and knew we were in a friendly land, with the hostiles all behind us.

6000|$|... "I {{would give}} it up," [...] he said to Surajah, [...] "were it not that, in the first place, it would almost break my mother's heart. Her {{conviction}} that my father is still alive has never been shaken. It has supported her all these years, and I believe that, were I to return and tell {{her that it was}} no longer possible to hope, her faith would still be unshaken. She would still think of him as pining in some dungeon, and would consider that I had given up the search from faint heartedness. That is my chief reason. But I own that I am almost as much influenced by my own conviction that he is in Savandroog. I quite admit that I can give no reason whatever why, if there is a prisoner there, it should be my father, and yet I cannot get it out of my mind that it is he. I suppose it is because I have the conviction that I believe in it. Why should I have that impression so strongly, if it were not a true one? I tell myself that it is absurd, that I have no real grounds to go upon, and yet that does not shake my faith in the slightest. It is perhaps <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> so fortunate. Altogether everything has turned out so favourably, that I can't help thinking he is alive, and that I shall find him.|$|E
6000|$|Dear Sir,--I {{thank you}} for the bundle of state-papers which I {{received}} yesterday. I have travelled through the negotiation,--and a sad, founderous road it is. There is a sort of standing jest against my countrymen,--that one of them on his journey having found a piece of pleasant road, he proposed to his companion to go over it again. This proposal, with regard to the worthy traveller's final destination, was certainly a blunder. It was no blunder as to his immediate satisfaction; for the way was pleasant. In the irksome journey of the Regicide negotiations it is otherwise: our [...] "paths are not paths of pleasantness, nor our ways the ways to peace." [...] All our mistakes, (if such they are,) like those of our Hibernian traveller, are mistakes of repetition; and they will be full as far from bringing us to our place of rest as his well-considered project was from forwarding him to his inn. Yet I see we persevere. Fatigued with our former course, too listless to explore a new one, kept in action by inertness, moving only <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in motion, with a sort of plodding perseverance we resolve to measure back again the very same joyless, hopeless, and inglorious track. Backward and forward,--oscillation, space,--the travels of a postilion, miles enough to circle the globe in one short stage,--we have been, and we are yet to be, jolted and rattled over the loose, misplaced stones and the treacherous hollows of this rough, ill-kept, broken-up, treacherous French causeway! ...|$|E
6000|$|That {{evening the}} first mate said to Stephen: “The captain {{has been telling}} us about that bag of money you got hold of, Steve, and we all think that your offer to treat {{it as if it}} were prize-money is a very kind one, but we agree with him that it would be a mistake. In the first place, the money wouldn’t go far. In any matter of that sort the ship, that is to say the owners, take a large share to begin with, the {{officers}} take some shares, and the men’s shares would not come to a pound a head. A pound a head would only suffice for them to have a drunken spree on shore, but they are just as well without that, and, as the captain says, it is astonishing what little things upset sailors’ minds. They might take it into their head that as you got two hundred pounds in that hut there might be a lot more, and they would be wanting to land and to turn the village upside down, and there would be bloodshed and all sorts of trouble. The old saying, ‘Least said, soonest mended’, comes in here strongly. We have, so far, got on very well with the natives this voyage, and I hope that we shall continue to do so to the end. I quite allow that we should all of us be glad to give a sharp lesson to that village ashore. They have been plundering, and I have no doubt murdering, the crew of some ship. Still, we have no evidence of that, and we can’t attack the village on mere supposition. They have been friendly enough with us, partly <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> here before, and the captain gets on well with them, but more because they are perfectly well aware that we are always on guard, and that there is no chance whatever of their catching us asleep. In nine cases out of ten it is the carelessness and over-confidence of sailors that tempt the natives to take advantage of it; they would never have shown you these things if they had had any idea of attacking us.” ...|$|E
