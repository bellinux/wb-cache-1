25|$|When a tooth {{is picked}} up, it {{should always be}} grasped by the enamel on the crown. Finger {{pressure}} on the tooth root cells will cause cell crushing. Any attempt to clean off any debris should be avoided. Debris should always be washed off gently with, at the very least, a physiologic saline. Even {{with the use of}} a physiologic saline, the “scrubbing” of the tooth root to remove debris must be avoided. When placed in a physiologic solution, the tooth should be gently agitated to permit the cleansing of the tooth root. At the same time that this agitation occurs, the bumping of the tooth root against a hard surface such as glass, plastic or even cardboard must also be avoided. For the same reasons, the method in which the knocked-out teeth are transported must be carefully selected. Placing the knocked-out teeth in transporting vehicles such as tissues and handkerchiefs can be damaging and transporting them in glass or cardboard containers can also be potentially damaging to the cells. In addition to the potential damage that the hard surface can cause, glass containers have the added possibility of breakage or leakage of the physiologic storage fluid. If the glass container does not have a tightly fitting top, then during the transportation, the physiologic storage solution can spill out and the teeth can fall, once again, on the floor and, at the same time, <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> physiologic environment.|$|E
2500|$|Carey {{attributed}} his subdued {{reaction to}} the perfect bid by saying, [...] "Everybody thought someone had cheated. We'd just fired Roger Dobkowitz, and all the fan groups were upset about it. ... I remember asking, 'Are we ever going to air this?' And nobody could see how we could. So I thought the show {{was never going to}} air. I thought somebody had cheated us, and I thought the whole show was over. I {{thought they were going to}} shut us down, and I thought I was going to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> job." [...] Kniess later defended his actions, claiming that he never cheated, and in the end, was awarded his prizes. (His feat can be comparable to the actions of Michael Larson, who appeared on the CBS 1980s game show Press Your Luck, and won $110,237 by memorizing the board sequence.) ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{tours of}} Australia it was usual for state teams to be {{reinforced}} with potential Australian players to provide stronger opposition, allow the selectors to judge their ability and {{to entertain the}} crowd. Paul Sheahan of Victorian was brought over after his failures {{in the first two}} Tests, but he did not get to bat as the second and third days of the three day game were rained off. On the first day Geoff Boycott (74) and Colin Cowdrey (64) added 98 for the first wicket and the tourists reached 184/4 from 47 overs. Manager David Clark told his team that if they continued to play as they did they would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> job in fives years and 'pointed the slow-scoring bone at both captains' Ray Illingworth and Bill Lawry. Frank Tyson agreed, writing [...] "Wake up and entertain, or you could be drawing unemployment benefits next week".|$|E

60|$|I looked, too, at the seamen {{with the}} skiff--big brown fellows, some in shirts, some with jackets, some with {{coloured}} handkerchiefs about their throats, {{one with a}} brace of pistols stuck into his pockets, two or three with knotty bludgeons, and all with their case-knives.

60|$|Neither has he so far {{forgotten}} a poor inhabitant of his suburbs, whose best prospect is on {{the garden}} of Leicester House, but that more than once he has been offering him his patronage, to reconcile him to a world, of which his misfortunes have made him weary[3]. There is another Sidney still remaining, though there can never be another Spenser to deserve the favour. But one Sidney gave his patronage to the applications of a poet; the other offered it unasked.

She was very angry,--angry even with her mother; and she was half broken-hearted, truly believing that such a letter as that which she was desired to write would estrange her lover from her for ever. So they sat, and for a few minutes no word was spoken between them.|$|E

But {{there was a man}} among them, a small farmer named Jonathan Dicksey, who thought otherwise. This Jonathan, who held his land under Christopher, had been forced to this business of the defence of Cranwell Towers somewhat against his will, namely, by the pressure of Christopher's largest tenant, to whose daughter he was affianced. He was a sly young man, and even during the siege, by means that need not be described, he had contrived to convey a message to the Abbot of Blossholme, telling him that had it been in his power he would gladly be in any other place. Therefore, as he knew well, whatever had happened to others, his farm remained unharried. Now he determined to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bad business as soon as he might, for Jonathan {{was one of those who}} liked to stand upon the winning side.|$|E

No; the casual labourer is here because he is wanted here. He is here in answer to a perfectly well-defined demand. He is here as the result of economic causes which have been too long unregulated. He is not the natural product, he is an article manufactured, called into being, to suit the requirements, in the Prime Minister's telling phrase, of all industries at particular times and of particular industries at all times.|$|E

[...] She was herself very prettily dressed, and though she looked thin, and at times gave a deep, dismal cough, she was so bright and gay that it was impossible not to feel hopeful about her. She became very confidential with Mrs. Sewell, whom she apparently brevetted Lemuel's best friend, and obliged to a greater show of interest in him than she had ever felt. She told her the whole history of her love affair, and of how much 'Manda Grier had done to help it on at first, and then how she had wanted her to break off with Lemuel.

6000|$|There is {{a little}} old Genoese lady comes to sell us pins, needles, thread, tape, and the like roba, whom I regard as leading quite an ideal life in some respects. Her traffic {{is limited to a}} certain number of {{families}} who speak more or less Italian; and her days, so far as they are concerned, must be passed in an atmosphere of sympathy and kindliness. The truth is, we Northern and New World folk cannot help but cast a little romance about whoever comes to us from Italy, whether we have actually known the beauty and charm of that land or not. Then this old lady is in herself a very gentle and lovable kind of person, with a tender mother- face, which is also the face of a child. A smile plays always upon her wrinkled visage, and her quick and restless eyes are full of friendliness. There is never much stuff in her basket, however, and it is something of a mystery how she manages to live from it. None but an Italian could, I am sure; and her experience must test the full virtue of the national genius for cheap salads and much-extenuated soup-meat. I do not know whether it is native in her, or whether it is a grace acquired from long dealing with those kindly-hearted customers of hers in Charlesbridge, but she is of a most munificent spirit, and returns every smallest benefit with some present from her basket. She makes me ashamed of things I have written about the sordidness of her race, but I shall vainly seek to atone for them by open-handedness to her. She will give favor for favor; she will not even count the money she receives; our bargaining is a contest of the courtliest civilities, ending in many an [...] "Adieu!" [...] "To meet again!" [...] "Remain well!" [...] and [...] "Finally!" [...] not surpassed if rivaled in any Italian street. In her ineffectual way, she brings us news of her different customers, breaking up their stout Saxon names into tinkling polysyllables which suggest them only to the practiced sense, and is perfectly patient and contented if we mistake one for another. She loves them all, but she pities them as living in a terrible climate; and doubtless in her heart she purposes one day to go back to Italy, there to die. In the mean time she is very cheerful; she, too, has had her troubles,--what troubles I do not remember, but those that come by sickness and by death, and that really seem no sorrows until they come to us,--yet she never complains. It is hard to make a living, and the house-rent alone is six dollars a month; but still one lives, and does not fare so ill either. As {{it does not seem to}} be in her to dislike any one, it must <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> harmless guile, felt to be comforting to servant-ridden householders, that she always speaks of [...] "those Irish," [...] her neighbors, with a bated breath, a shaken head, a hand lifted to the cheek, and an averted countenance.|$|E
