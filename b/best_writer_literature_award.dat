60|$|That was {{the feeling}} {{in the heart of}} many a {{promising}} young southern or northern poet in midcentury, just as it was in 1776, when our <b>best</b> <b>writers</b> neglected <b>literature</b> for political satires against Whigs or Tories. Yet of the thousand works which the antislavery agitation inspired we can think of only one, Mrs. Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, which lives with power to our own day; and there is something of universal human nature in that famous book, written not from knowledge or experience but from the imagination, which appeals broadly to our human sympathy, and which makes it welcome in countries where slavery as a political or a moral issue has long since been forgotten.|$|R
500|$|At {{the time}} of her death, Eberhardt's {{possessions}} included several of her unpublished manuscripts. Lyautey instructed his soldiers to search for all of her papers {{in the aftermath of the}} flood, and posted those that could be found to Barrucand. After reconstructing them, substituting his own words where the originals were missing or too damaged to decipher, he began to publish her work. Some of what he published is considered to be more his work than Eberhardt's. Barrucand also received criticism for listing himself as the co-author of many of the publications, and for not clarifying which portions of text were his own. The first posthumous story, [...] "Dans l'Ombre Chaude de l'Islam" [...] (In the Warm Shadow of Islam) received critical acclaim when it was published in 1906. The book's success drew great attention to Eberhardt's writing and established her as among the <b>best</b> <b>writers</b> of <b>literature</b> inspired by Africa. A street was named after Eberhardt in Béchar and another in Algiers. The street in Algiers is in the outskirts; one writer at the time commented there was a sad symbolism in the fact the street [...] "begins in an inhabited quarter and peters out into a wasteland". She was posthumously seen as an advocate of feminism and decolonisation; according to Hedi Abdel-Jaouad in Yale French Studies, her work may have begun the decolonisation of North Africa. However, Eberhardt's relationship with Lyautey has triggered discussion by modern historians about her complicity in colonialism.|$|R
