5|$|The {{squadron}} {{received its}} fifth KC-30 on 3December 2012, and achieved {{initial operating capability}} in February 2013. It expected to reach final operating capability, with both boom and probe-and-drogue delivery systems, in 2014. On 14September that year, the Federal government committed to deploying one of the squadron's KC-30s to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, {{as part of a}} coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. The aircraft was only cleared for operations with the probe-and-drogue system, as by this stage the <b>boom</b> <b>system</b> was not ready. The KC-30 began flying missions in Iraq on 1October 2014. The first successful contact using the <b>boom</b> <b>system</b> (in concert with another RAAF KC-30) took place near Amberley on 13May 2015. In July, the Federal government announced the purchase of two more KC-30s for delivery in 2018, taking No.33 Squadron's fleet to seven aircraft; the airframes were to be ex-Qantas A330-200 passenger liners, converted by Airbus Defence and Space at Getafe, near Madrid. The KC-30 deployed to Iraq undertook the first operational use of the <b>boom</b> <b>system</b> in late October 2015, refuelling an RAAF E-7 Wedgetail. In March 2016, No.33 Squadron was awarded the Duke of Gloucester Cup as the RAAF's most proficient squadron of the previous year, as well as the RAAF Maintenance Trophy.|$|E

In this research project, we compared runoff from plots irrigated with typical in line sprinklers on a linear move irrigation system with those irrigated with off set <b>boom</b> <b>systems.</b> In line drops consistently generated greater runoff than ‘the <b>boom</b> <b>systems</b> {{in all of the}} irrigation events. Differences in runoff between the drop types were significantly different for the second, third, fourth and fifth irrigation events.

40|$|Center pivot and linear move {{irrigation}} systems’ {{design and}} operation are primarily limited by soil infiltration rates. Surface runoff {{can be a}} problem on some soils whose in-take rates are low. Additional design and management factors must be considered to prevent runoff in these <b>systems.</b> <b>Boom</b> <b>systems</b> have been suggested to decrease runoff by reducing the water application rate of center pivots and linear move systems. In this study, runoff from plots irrigated with typical in-line sprinklers was compared to runoff from plots irrigated with off-set <b>boom</b> <b>systems.</b> Both inline sprinkler drops and the <b>boom</b> <b>systems</b> were fitted on the same linear move system. Sprinkler nozzle type and size was the same for both in-line drops and the off-set boom drops. Runoff was measured for five irrigation events applied on bare soil during three weeks in October 2013. Differences in runoff between the drop types were significant for the second, third, fourth, and fifth irrigation events. In-line drops generated between 3 % and 24 % more runoff than the <b>boom</b> <b>systems</b> during the test period. Runoff as a percentage of irrigation water applied increased with each irrigation event for both drop types. The increase however was higher for the in-line drops than for the <b>boom</b> <b>systems.</b> Increase in runoff with increase in sprinkler irrigation events was mainly attributed to soil surface sealing which resulted from sprinkler drop impact...|$|R

25|$|Flight testing {{began in}} May 1948 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, {{and was so}} {{successful}} that in June orders went out to equip all new B-50s and subsequent bombers with receiving equipment. Two dedicated air refueling units were formed on June 30, 1948: the 43d Air Refueling Squadron at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, and the 509th Air Refueling Squadron at Walker Air Force Base, New Mexico. The first ARS aircraft used FRL's looped-hose refueling system, but testing with a <b>boom</b> <b>system</b> followed quickly {{in the autumn of}} 1948.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{retirement}} of the Boeing 707, No.33 Squadron relocated to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, on 1July 2008. It was presented with a Squadron Standard by Queensland Governor Penelope Wensley on 2June 2010, to commemorate [...] "25 years of faithful and outstanding service". Having been without aircraft for three years, the squadron began re-equipping with the first of five Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports on 1June 2011. The KC-30 could carry one-and-a-half times as much fuel as the 707 and was configured with both probe-and-drogue and boom delivery systems. These aircraft had originally been scheduled to enter service late in 2008, and the RAAF had to lease tankers from the United States Air Force and Omega Air to meet its aerial refuelling needs while Airbus rectified problems with the <b>boom</b> <b>system</b> and completed essential technical documentation. In March 2012, one of the KC-30s set a record {{for the number of}} passengers carried on an RAAF aircraft, 220 cadets from the Australian Defence Force Academy.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, General Curtis LeMay, {{commander}} of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), asked Boeing to develop a refueling system that could transfer fuel {{at a higher rate}} than had been possible with earlier systems using flexible hoses, resulting in the flying <b>boom</b> <b>system.</b> [...] The B-29 was the first to employ the boom, and between 1950 and 1951, 116 original B-29s, designated KB-29Ps, were converted at the Boeing plant at Renton, Washington. Boeing went on to develop the world’s first production aerial tanker, the KC-97 Stratofreighter, a piston-engined Boeing Stratocruiser (USAF designation C-97 Stratofreighter) with a Boeing-developed flying boom and extra kerosene (jet fuel) tanks feeding the boom. [...] The Stratocruiser airliner itself was developed from the B-29 bomber after World War II. In the KC-97, the mixed gasoline/kerosene fuel system was clearly not desirable and it was obvious that a jet-powered tanker aircraft would be the next development, having a single type of fuel for both its own engines and for passing to receiver aircraft. The 230mph (370km/h) cruise speed of the slower, piston-engined KC-97 was also a serious issue, as using it as an aerial tanker forced the newer jet-powered military aircraft to slow down to mate with the tanker's boom, a highly serious issue with the newer supersonic aircraft coming into service at that time, which could force such receiving aircraft in some situations to slow down enough to approach their stall speed during the approach to the tanker. It was no surprise that, after the KC-97, Boeing began receiving contracts from the USAF to build jet tankers based on the Boeing 367-80 (Dash-80) airframe. [...] The result was the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, of which 732 were built.|$|E

50|$|The {{other common}} type of furling system is for the {{mainsail}}. The mainsail may be furled into the mast or the boom, with <b>boom</b> furling <b>systems</b> being simpler and more common. The simplest <b>boom</b> furling <b>system</b> consists of a boom that can rotate along its axis, with a latch to lock it in place. Provision {{must be made to}} allow the mainsail to wrap around the boom without interfering with the mainsheet, such as end-boom sheeting or a bridle. To furl the mainsail, the boom is unlocked, and then rotated to take up the desired amount of mainsail, and then locked in place. More advanced <b>boom</b> furling <b>systems</b> will wrap the furling mechanism in a slotted cover, so the sail furls inside the cover; this also makes sheeting easier, since the sheet may be attached to the outer portion of the <b>boom.</b> These <b>systems</b> use either a line, a hand operated crank, or a hydraulic or electric powered furler.|$|R
