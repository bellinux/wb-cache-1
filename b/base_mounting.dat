Because turning the aircraft would put too much stress on the unsupported wing, Janisse put the aircraft down in a bean field. After the roadway was closed to traffic, Janisse drove the otherwise undamaged aircraft back to the airport.|$|E
5000|$|Older {{telescopic}} sights {{often did}} not offer windage and elevation adjustments in the scope, but rather used adjustable mounts to provide adjustment. Some modern mounts also allow for adjustment, but it is generally intended to supplement the scope adjustments. For example, some situations require fairly extreme elevation adjustments, such as very short range shooting common with airguns, or very long range shooting, where the bullet drop becomes very significant. Also, loose manufacturing tolerances may result in <b>base</b> <b>mounting</b> holes being less than perfectly aligned with the bore. In this case, rather than adjusting the scope to the extremes of its elevation adjustment, the scope mount can be adjusted. This allows the scope to operate {{near the center of}} its adjustment range, which puts less stress on the internals. Some companies offer adjustable bases, while others offer tapered bases with a given amount of elevation built in (commonly listed in MOA). The adjustable bases are more flexible, but the fixed bases are far more durable, as adjustable bases may loosen and shift under recoil. [...] Also, adjustable bases are considerably more expensive, as well.|$|E

Examination revealed an overload region preceding the progressive slow crack propagation zone. From the analysis, it appears most probable that a crack was generated at the fillet of the base due to sudden inadvertent load. The crack thus produced acted as a notch for fatigue crack initiation and propagation under the fluctuating load resulting in failure of the antenna. No mechanical/material defects {{were responsible for the}} fatigue crack initiation...|$|E
40|$|Al-Li alloy and {{aluminum}} honeycomb panel (AHP) are both excellent materials for aeronautical structures. In this paper, a plate-type aeronautical structure (PAS), {{which is a}} <b>base</b> <b>mounting</b> structure for 172 [*]kg functional devices, is selected for comparative analysis with different materials. To compare system-level performance under multidisciplinary constraints, mathematical models for optimization are established and then structural optimization is carried out using Altair OptiStruct. For AHP, its honeycomb core is regarded as orthotropic material and its mechanical properties are calculated by Allen’s model {{in order to establish}} finite element model (FEM). The heights of facing sheet and honeycomb core are selected as design variables for size optimization. For Al-Li alloy plate, topology optimization is carried out to obtain its most efficient load path; and then a reconstruction process is executed for practical manufacturing consideration; to obtain its final configuration, accurate size optimization is also used for reconstructed model of Al-Li alloy plate. Finally, the optimized mass and performance of two PASs are compared. Results show that AHP is slightly superior to Al-Li alloy...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE. The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the changes in {{retentive}} force of stud attachments for implant overdentures by in vitro 2 -year–wear simulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Three commercially available attachment systems were investigated: Kerator blue, O-ring red, and EZ lock. Two implant fixtures were embedded in parallel in each custom <b>base</b> <b>mounting.</b> Five pairs of each attachment system were tested. A universal testing machine was used to measure the retentive force during 2500 insertion and removal cycles. Surface changes on the components were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by Pairwise comparison, was used to compare the retentive force between the groups, and to determine groups that were significantly different (α. 05). After 2500 insertion and removal cycles, the highest retention loss was recorded for O-ring, and no significant difference between Kerator and EZ lock (P>. 05). Also, Kerator showed the highest retentive force, followed by EZ lock and O-ring, after 2500 cycles (P<. 05). Based on SEM analysis, the polymeric components in O-ring and Kerator were observed to exhibit surface wear and deformation. CONCLUSION. After 2500 insertion and removal cycles, all attachments exhibited significant loss in retention. Mechanism of retention loss can only be partially explained by surface changes.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} was {{observed}} performances of developed three degrees of freedom (dof) parallel mechanism named 3 -URU spherical parallel mechanism. The mechanism is composed of three identical limbs mounted symmetrically to base (fixed link) and platform (output link). The limb is constructed by universal-revolute and universal joints. The kinematic constants of mechanism consisting of link lengths, radius of platform, radius of <b>base,</b> <b>mounting</b> angle of limb and platform to base and platform were determined with consideration of velocity transmission and force constraint indices. To evaluate performance of mechanism, it was manufactured a prototype of mechanism designed base on these two mentioned indices. There are three steps proposed to realize the mechanism, (i) kinematic synthesis to determine of kinematic constants, (ii) design of mechanical components to define shape and dimension of links and joints by considering collision in wokingspace and static analysis, (iii) evaluation of mechanism performances consisting of workingspace, controllability of platform motion and static payload. Based on obtained results, it can be clarified that, the mechanism can produce spherical motion of platform which rotates on steady point recognized as center of platform rotation. The platform can achieve maximum inclination angle, 80 degree and at this posture occurs translational error, 0. 0102 mm. On the other hand, the mechanism can support payload ten times of weight of moving parts...|$|E

40|$|Robotic {{systems are}} {{expected}} to play an increasingly important role in future space activities, such as repairing, upgrading, refuelling, and re-orbiting spacecraft. These technologies could potentially {{extend the life of}} satellites, enhance the capability of space systems, reduce the operation costs, and clean up the increasing space debris. Recent proposals for missions involving the use of space manipulators and/or automated transfer vehicles are presented as a solution for a lot of problems which now affect the procedures and the performance of the in-orbit space systems. Other projects involving space manipulators have been developed by DARPA aiming to demonstrate several satellite servicing operations and technologies including rendez-vous, proximity operations and station-keeping, capture, docking, fluid transfer (specifically, “hydrazine”), and ORU (Orbit Replaceable Unit) transfer. Of course the dynamic coupling between the manipulator and its <b>base</b> <b>mounting</b> flexible solar arrays is very difficult to model. Furthermore the motion planning of a space robots is usually much more complicated than the motion planning of fixed-base manipulators. In this paper first of all the authors present a mixed NE/EL formulation suitable for synthesizing optimal control strategies during the deploying manoeuvres of robotic arms mounted on flexible orbiting platform (i. e. the chaser). Then two new control strategies able compensate the flexibility excitations of the chaser satellite solar panels during the capturing of a flexible target spacecraft with the use of two robotic arms are presented and applied to a grasping manoeuver. The mission is here divided into three main phases: the approaching, the docking and the post-grasping phase. Several numerical examples will complete the work...|$|E

50|$|The <b>base</b> <b>mount</b> is the {{connection}} between the tripod head and the tripod legs. Often the head will have a fairly large, flat base that sits on top of the tripod, and uses cork or rubber to increase the friction between the two, to prevent the head from unscrewing during use.

A common standard for <b>base</b> <b>mounts</b> on photographic tripod equipment is a 3/8-16 screw on the tripod (a screw that is 3/8 inches in diameter, with 16 threads per inch) and a matching receptacle on the tripod head.
