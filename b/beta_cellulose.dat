40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the potential use of pulp mill wastewater sludge as substrate in ethanol production. The simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process was conducted by using Saccharomyces cerevisiae TISTR 5339 under optimum proportion of cellulase and pulp mill wastewater sludge. The ethanol production from cellulosic materials in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation needs cooperation between cellulase and yeast. The cellulase hydrolyzes cellulose to sugar while yeast utilizes sugar to produce ethanol. The pulp mill wastewater sludge has an average content of 73. 3 % hemi cellulose, 67. 1 % alpha cellulose, 4. 7 % <b>beta</b> <b>cellulose</b> and 1. 4 % gramma cellulose. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} volume of the ethanol tend to increase with time, providing the maximum ethanol yield of 0. 69 g/g on the 7 th day, {{the last day of the}} experiment. The ethanol production was scaled up in 5 L fermentor under optimum proportion and increased the fermentation period. It was found that the ethanol production gave the maximum ethanol yield of 1. 14 g/g on the 9 th day of the totally 13 days experimentation. These results showed that the cellulose from pulp mill wastewater sludge was as effective substrate for ethanol production and alternative energy for the future...|$|E
40|$|The study {{focuses on}} the effect of {{alkaline}} and silane treatment of hemp fibers on mechanical and thermal conductivity. Hemp fibers were treated with sodium hydroxide solutions at different concentration, and then analysed by infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, the X-ray diffraction, mechanical tensile test; and a scanning electron microscope. The alkali fibers were subsequently treated with silane solutions and then analysed by the same techniques. Analysis results showed that the most changes caused by this treatment are, the elimination of a certain amount of lignin, wax and oils spanning the cell wall of the fibers and the transformation of some quantity of alpha to <b>beta</b> <b>cellulose.</b> These changes are at the origin of improvement on tensile strength and young's modulus of about 39 % and 23 % respectively when the concentration of treatment reaches 8 %. This modification revealed a strong increase in the Interfacial adhesion of the fibers-polyurethane composite from 1. 26  MPa for untreated fibers up to 3. 18 for the alkali fibers and 5. 16 for silane fibers. Moreover, the measurement of the thermal conductivity has proved that the chemical treatment increase the fibers thermal conductivity from 42. 22  mW/m°K for untreated fibers to 47, 92  mW/m°K for the alkali fiber at 8 %...|$|E
40|$|High quality antique {{sheets of}} paper have been {{characterized}} by H- 1 NMR relaxation, C- 13 CP MAS spectra, and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Paper {{can be regarded as}} a bi-component material made by cellulose and water plus a small amount of organic and inorganic additives and impurities. Semi-crystalline fibrous cellulose, rich in water, is present as polymorphs I alpha and I <b>beta.</b> Amorphous <b>cellulose,</b> with a lower water content, presents a higher amount of paramagnetic impurities and is characterized by quite short H- 1 spin-lattice relaxation times and by C- 13 resonances with noticeable chemical shifts. ''Ad hoc'' tailored sequences are able to produce C- 13 CP MAS spectra in which the amorphous content of cellulose in paper is quite well observable. The nature of water as fully bound to the cellulose lattice has also been proved. Low-temperature EPR spectra have shown the presence of measurable amounts of different inorganic paramagnetic impurities, such as Fe 3 +, Mn 2 +, Cu 2 + often found in different stereochemical environments. The spectra are all, qualitatively, closely similar. However, quantitative data have shown that in paper the state of conservation does not depend on the amount of pseudo-octahedral iron, but is strongly correlated to the concentration of this metal ion in a rhombic stereochemistry and to the presence of even very small amounts of copper...|$|R
40|$|Commercial-scale biofuel {{production}} requires a {{deep understanding of}} the structure and dynamics of its principal target: cellulose. However, an accurate description and modeling of this carbohydrate structure at the mesoscale remains elusive, particularly because of its overwhelming length scale and configurational complexity. We have derived a set of MARTINI coarse-grained force field parameters for the simulation of crystalline cellulose fibers. The model is adapted to reproduce different physicochemical and mechanical properties of native <b>cellulose</b> I <b>beta.</b> The model is able not only to handle a transition from <b>cellulose</b> I <b>beta</b> to another <b>cellulose</b> allomorph, cellulose IIII, but also to capture the physical response to temperature and mechanical bending of longer cellulose nanofibers. By developing the MARTINI model of a solid cellulose crystalline fiber from {{the building blocks of}} a soluble cellobiose coarse-grained model, we have provided a systematic way to build MARTINI models for other crystalline biopolymers...|$|R
40|$|The NSP in {{cereal grains}} are {{composed}} predominantly of arabinoxylans (pentosans), <b>beta</b> glucans and <b>cellulose.</b> The main soluble NSP in these grains are arabinoxylans, while in barley and oats the are betaglucans. In this experiment {{we want to}} establish the influence of NSPs and NSPi from barley on nutritive and bioproductive indices at broiler chickens. The experiment was carried out on 120 broiler chickens divided in four experimental groups (CL, EL 1, EL 2 and EL 3). The difference between the experimental groups was the different percentage of barley {{in the structure of}} combined forage and it was between 0 and 30 % in the growth period from eclosion to 21 days and between 0 and 40 % from 22 till 42 days of age. On the entire growth period the smallest forage consumption was registered by the control group, which had no barley in the structure of combined forage and registered the smallest values of NSPs and NSPi. The body weight at experimental groups was smaller with 3. 25 % but the differences were not statistical significant. In the growth period from 0 - 6 weeks in the experimental group EL 1 the specific consumption is greater with 5. 63 % comparatively with the control group CL...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteJ. Scott SmithIn {{the past}} 50 {{years or so}} dietary fiber has become an {{increasingly}} significant area of nutritional focus, debate, and research. Advances in food production practices have resulted {{in more and more}} refined foods being available and consumed throughout the world and particularly in developed nations such as the United States. While refined foods are typically more palatable to consumers, the content of dietary fiber is greatly reduced. Currently many diseases are believed to be associated with a lack of dietary fiber intake, and furthermore significant health benefits are thought possible via increased consumption of many dietary fibers. These issues are discussed in Chapter 2 - Dietary Fiber and Disease. There is not a well accepted definition for dietary fiber, but most reference the human inability to fully digest fibers, fibers being made up of various monomer units of variable length, and some mention plant origin. In many ways the definition of dietary fiber is connected to the analytical methods used to quantify it, which there are many, several of which are detailed in Chapter 5 - Analytical Techniques for Dietary Fiber. Newer ingredients that are not quantified by typical fiber analysis methods have created the need for additional assays. Dietary fiber is subject to all sorts of labeling regulations and a few nutritional claims. This has resulted in many manufacturers taking an interest in increasing the fiber content of their products while maintaining product quality and label friendliness. There are many raw materials/ingredients that can increase the fiber content in foods, each with its own set of functional and sensory characteristics. These are detailed in Chapter 7 and include acacia gum, <b>beta</b> glucan, <b>cellulose,</b> chitin/chitosan, corn bran, corn fiber, inulin, oat Bran/oat fiber, pea fiber, pectin, polydextrose, psyllium, resistant starch, rice bran, soy fibers, wheat bran, and wheat fiber. These fibers are unique in their functional capability and effect on flavor and texture. Discussion of the product development considerations includes these functional characteristics as well as cost, ingredient labeling requirements, usage levels, other sensory characteristics, storage stability, and effect on water activity...|$|R
