25|$|When {{the board}} has no {{embedded}} components it is more correctly called a printed wiring board (PWB) or etched wiring board. However, the term printed wiring board has fallen into disuse. A PCB populated with electronic components is called a printed circuit assembly (PCA), printed circuit <b>board</b> <b>assembly</b> or PCB assembly (PCBA). The IPC preferred term for assembled boards is circuit card assembly (CCA), and for assembled backplanes it is backplane assemblies. The term PCB is used informally both for bare and assembled boards.|$|E

40|$|Packaging and {{interconnection}} {{are driving}} forces behind the miniaturization of electronics. Since miniaturization means less {{use of resources}} this trend seems inherently environmentally benign. Adverse effects may overlay this simple truth. The investments for new production facilities rise, the complexity and closeness of non-separable compounds in electronic products increase and the amount and applications of electronic goods multiply. The goal must be to influence new technology developments {{as early as possible}} to ensure that the balance of the listed effects remains positive for the environment.
