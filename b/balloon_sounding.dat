Conversely, the highest ozone concentrations were measured during early afternoon at heights of 100 - 600 m above ground level. Notably, these high ozone concentrations were normally accompanied by relatively higher concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide, but not carbon monoxide.

40|$|The {{vertical}} distribution of ozone {{in the lower}} troposphere over the Swiss Plateau is investigated in detail for two episodes in early spring (February 1998 and March 1999).

Additionally, the effect of in situ photochemistry was estimated {{for one of the}} episodes employing the Metphomod Eulerian photochemical model. Although the meteorological situations were completely different, both cases had elevated layers with high ozone concentrations, which is not untypical for late winter and early spring. In the February episode, the highest ozone concentrations of 55 to 60 ppb, which were found at around 1100 m asl, were partly advected from Southern France, but a considerable contribution of in situ photochemistry is also predicted by the model. Below that elevation, the local chemical sinks and surface deposition probably overcompensated chemical production, and the vertical ozone distribution was governed by boundary-layer dynamics.

Changes in LST between two periods (before and after construction of the wind turbines) and between wind farm pixels and nearby non-wind-farm pixels are quantified. An areal mean increase in LST by 0. 18 – 0. 39 °C is observed at nighttime over the wind farms, with the geographic distribution of this warming effect generally spatially coupled with {{the layout of the}} wind turbines (referred to as the spatial coupling), while there is no apparent impact on daytime LST. The nighttime LST warming effect varies with seasons, with the strongest warming in winter months of December-February, and the tightest spatial coupling in summer months of June-August. Analysis of seasonal variations in wind speed and direction from weather <b>balloon</b> <b>sounding</b> data and Automated Surface Observing System hourly observations from nearby stations suggest stronger winds correspond to seasons with greater warming and larger downwind impacts. The early morning soundings in Illinois are representative of the nighttime boundary layer and exhibit strong temperature inversions across all seasons. The strong and relatively shallow inversion in summer leaves warm air readily available to be mixed down and spatially well coupled with the turbine. Although the warming effect is strongest in winter, the spatial coupling is more erratic and spread out than in summer. These results suggest that the observed warming signal at nighttime is likely due to the net downward transport of heat from warmer air aloft to the surface, caused by the turbulent mixing in the wakes of the spinning turbine rotor blades...|$|E

In both years, distinct layers of enhanced aerosol backscatter in the lower stratosphere and the tropopause region have been observed on subsequent days coinciding with a significant increase in aerosol optical depth (measured with sun photometer) compared to the mean values from 2004 2007. Two case studies some weeks after the eruptions are compared: 1 September 2008 and 13 July 2009. Both days show the lowest layer of enhanced aerosol just above the tropopause with a backscatter ratio of 2 - 4. Calculations of the lidar ratio as well as the estimation of microphysical parameters of the aerosol particles were performed for these aerosol layers identifying significant differences between the two events. The Kasatochi aerosol showed a much higher lidar ratio indicating a higher index of refraction and hence a higher fraction of absorbing material. Furthermore, on 13 July 2009, the temperature profile obtained with a VAISALA RS 98 <b>balloon</b> <b>sounding</b> shows a negative correlation with layers of enhanced backscatter within the stratosphere, which could not be confirmed for 1 September 2008.
