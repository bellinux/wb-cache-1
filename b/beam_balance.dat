50|$|The Roberval {{balance is}} arguably less {{accurate}} {{and more difficult}} to manufacture than a <b>beam</b> <b>balance</b> with suspended plates. The <b>beam</b> <b>balance,</b> however, has the significant disadvantage of requiring suspensory strings, chains, or rods. For over three hundred years the Roberval balance has instead been popular for applications requiring convenience and only moderate accuracy, notably in retail trade.|$|E

5000|$|Triple <b>beam</b> <b>balance</b> is an {{instrument}} {{used to measure}} mass very precisely. The device has reading error of +/- 0.05 gram. The name refers to the three beams including the middle beam {{which is the largest}} size, the front beam which is the medium size, and the far beam which is the smallest size [...] The difference in size of the beams indicate the difference in weights and reading scale that each beam carry. The reading scale can be enumerated that the middle beam reads in 100 gram increments, the front beam can read from 0 to 10 grams, and the far beam can read in 10 gram increments. The triple <b>beam</b> <b>balance</b> can be used to measure mass directly from the objects, find mass by difference for liquid, and measure out a substance. The parts of triple <b>beam</b> <b>balance</b> are identified as the following.|$|E
5000|$|Riders are {{the sliding}} {{pointers}} used to indicate mass in grams {{of the mass}} on the pan. Before using triple <b>beam</b> <b>balance,</b> the scale pointer should be at zero.|$|E

5000|$|Zero {{adjustment}} knob is used {{only when the}} triple <b>beam</b> <b>balance</b> is not zero {{at the beginning of}} the lab to adjust the scale pointer to align with zero.|$|E
50|$|Because it {{has more}} moving joints which add friction, the Roberval balance is {{consistently}} less accurate than the traditional <b>beam</b> <b>balance,</b> but for many purposes this is compensated for by its usability.|$|E
5000|$|The scales (specifically, a two-pan, <b>beam</b> <b>balance)</b> {{are one of}} the {{traditional}} symbols of justice, as wielded by statues of Lady Justice. This corresponds to the use in metaphor of matters being [...] "held in the balance". It has its origins in ancient Egypt.|$|E
50|$|In about 1750, {{while still}} a student, Black {{developed}} the analytical balance {{based on a}} light-weight <b>beam</b> <b>balanced</b> on a wedge-shaped fulcrum. Each arm carried a pan on which the sample or standard weights was placed. It far exceeded the accuracy of any other balance {{of the time and}} became an important scientific instrument in most chemistry laboratories.|$|R

50|$|In 1810 {{he founded}} a {{mechanical}} workshop in Pforzheim and {{among other things}} manufactured precision <b>beam</b> <b>balances</b> and physical and hydrostatic equipment for laboratories and universities, as well as musical instruments. In 1820 the Grand Duchy of Baden appointed him official gold inspector. In 1829 he developed a safe oxyhydrogen equipment for soldering, and was at this time also operating a liquor distillery.|$|R
50|$|In 2014 {{a concept}} of hybrid scale has been introduced, the elastically {{deformable}} arm scale, which is a combination between a spring scale and a <b>beam</b> <b>balance,</b> exploiting simultaneously both principles of equilibrium and deformation. In this scale, the rigid arms of a classical <b>beam</b> <b>balance</b> (for example a steelyard) are replaced with a flexible elastic rod in an inclined frictionless sliding sleeve. The rod can reach a unique free of sliding equilibrium when two vertical dead loads (or masses) are applied at its edges. Equilibrium, which would be impossible with rigid arms, is guaranteed because configurational forces develop at the two edges of the sleeve {{as a consequence of}} both the free sliding condition and the nonlinear kinematics of the elastic rod. This weight measuring device can also work without a counterweight.|$|E

5000|$|In July 2015 an {{aerospace}} {{research group}} at the Dresden University of Technology (TUD) under Martin Tajmar reported results for an evaluation of an RF resonant tapered cavity similar to the EmDrive. Testing was performed first on a knife-edge <b>beam</b> <b>balance</b> able to detect force at the micronewton level, atop an antivibration granite table at ambient air pressure; then on a torsion pendulum with a force resolution of 0.1 mN, inside a vacuum chamber at ambient air pressure and in a hard vacuum at [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{form of a}} balance consisted of a beam with a fulcrum at its center. For highest accuracy, the fulcrum would consist of a sharp V-shaped pivot seated in a shallower V-shaped bearing. To determine {{the mass of the}} object, a combination of reference masses was hung {{on one end of the}} beam while the object of unknown mass was hung on the other end (see balance and steelyard balance). For high precision work, such as empirical chemistry, the center <b>beam</b> <b>balance</b> is still one of the most accurate technologies available, and is commonly used for calibrating test weights.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between stimulus and perception is logarithmic. This logarithmic relationship {{means that if}} a stimulus varies as a geometric progression (i.e., multiplied by a fixed factor), the corresponding perception is altered in an arithmetic progression (i.e., in additive constant amounts). For example, if a stimulus is tripled in strength (i.e., 3 x 1), the corresponding perception may be two times as strong as its original value (i.e., 1 + 1). If the stimulus is again tripled in strength (i.e., 3 x 3 x 3), the corresponding perception will be three times as strong as its original value (i.e., 1 + 1 + 1). Hence, for multiplications in stimulus strength, the strength of perception only adds. The mathematical derivations of the torques on a simple <b>beam</b> <b>balance</b> produce a description that is strictly compatible with Weber's law.|$|E
5000|$|Carey {{made her}} elite debut at the American Classic held at Karolyi Ranch on July 7, 2017. She only competed on vault, floor, and <b>balance</b> <b>beam</b> but placed first {{on each of}} those events. [...] Later that month she competed at the 2017 U.S. Classic and once again only competed on vault, floor, and <b>balance</b> <b>beam.</b> She won on vault and floor and placed fourth on <b>balance</b> <b>beam.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Roberval {{balances}} {{are frequently}} depicted with the [...] "pan" [...] as a plate or peg {{protruding from the}} center of each vertical column— this is so that the balance can have a center of gravity that is in the actual center of the parallelogram and so that adding weights to these plates does not change that center of gravity. This produces the somewhat odd result that a correctly balanced Roberval balance, unlike a <b>beam</b> <b>balance,</b> can be [...] "balanced" [...] in any arm position: so long as the masses of the objects on both sides are equal or the pans are empty, it will balance with the right arm up and the left arm down, as well as the left up and the right down, as well as any position in between, and all of these positions will be [...] "correctly balanced." ...|$|E
50|$|Sixteen is {{the fourth}} power of two. For this reason, 16 was used in {{weighing}} light objects in several cultures. The British have 16 ounces in one pound; the Chinese used to have 16 liangs in one jin. In old days, weighing was done with a <b>beam</b> <b>balance</b> to make equal splits. It {{would be easier to}} split a heap of grains into sixteen equal parts through successive divisions than to split into ten parts. Chinese Taoists did finger computation on the trigrams and hexagrams by counting the finger tips and joints of the fingers with the tip of the thumb. Each hand can count up to 16 in such manner. The Chinese abacus uses two upper beads to represent the 5s and 5 lower beads to represent the 1s, the 7 beads can represent a hexadecimal digit from 0 to 15 in each column.|$|E
5000|$|The balance (also balance scale, <b>beam</b> <b>balance</b> and {{laboratory}} balance) {{was the first}} mass measuring instrument invented. In its traditional form, it consists of a pivoted horizontal lever with arms of equal lengththe beamand a weighing pan suspended from each arm (hence the plural name [...] "scales for a weighing instrument). The unknown mass is placed in one pan and standard masses of known weight {{are added to the}} other pan until the beam is as close to equilibrium as possible. In precision balances, a more accurate determination of the mass is given by the position of a sliding mass moved along a graduated scale. Technically, a balance compares weight rather than mass, but, in a given gravitational field (such as Earth's gravity), the weight of an object is proportional to its mass, so the standard [...] "weights" [...] used with balances are usually labeled in units of mass (g, kg, etc.).|$|E
25|$|A <b>balance</b> <b>beam</b> is {{the long}} arm {{projecting}} from the landward {{side of the}} gate over the towpath. As well as providing leverage to open and close the heavy gate, the <b>beam</b> also <b>balances</b> the (non-floating) weight of the gate in its socket, and so allows the gate to swing more freely.|$|R
5000|$|Kui {{went on to}} win two bronze {{medals at}} the 1997 World Championships, with her team and on the <b>balance</b> <b>beam.</b> The <b>balance</b> <b>beam</b> result was controversial: Kui {{performed}} the most difficult routine of all the competitors in the final—including a full-twisting back layout, as well as three split leaps to a back handspring and two layout step-outs—but finished [...]012 behind Romania's Gina Gogean. She lost the silver medal to Svetlana Khorkina of Russia in a tie-breaker. The results prompted the president of the International Federation of Gymnastics to publicly chastise the judges.|$|R
50|$|Ezhova was a {{mainstay}} of the Russian team from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s. She also represented Russia at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing where she competed only <b>balance</b> <b>beam.</b> She was particularly noted for her work on <b>balance</b> <b>beam</b> where she was a four (4) time world and European medalist, including a gold medal. Her <b>balance</b> <b>beam</b> routines were characterized by {{a wide array of}} difficult acrobatic skills connected in immediate, unusual sequencing.|$|R
