40|$|Assuming an {{exponential}} decay model (EDM) for pH decline {{as a function}} of temperature, ideal shortening (i. e. neither hot nor cold shortening) for an individual carcase occurs if and only if that carcase's model parameters fall within a specific sub-region of three dimensional space. This paper demonstrates that simply fitting EDMs to a sample <b>of</b> <b>carcases</b> and using the proportion <b>of</b> sampled <b>carcases</b> with estimated parameters within the specific sub-region can lead to seriously biassed estimates for the proportion <b>of</b> <b>carcases</b> ideally shortened. This is particularly so if the EDMs are fitted separately to each sampled carcase but also remains the case, to a lesser extent, if the models are fitted jointly using random effects modelling. A preferred estimate is based on the probability that an independently selected carcase has model parameters within the specific region, based on the distribution of the EMD parameters.

A major multi-breed study reported that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly faster than popular British breeds, and marginally faster than other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being faster than Limousins. Limousins are especially favoured for crossbreeding with cattle such as Angus, Hereford and Shorthorn because of their ability to contribute hybrid vigour, and improve the yield and feed conversion efficiency of these British breeds, which produce higher levels of fat and marbled meat.|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The NSW poultry {{processing}} industry {{has gone through}} an evolution of regulatory change over the past 100 years from an inspection system through to a HACCP-based food safety system audited by the NSW Food Safety Authority (FSA). This required the restructuring of legislation {{and an understanding of}} the appropriate microbiological standards by which the FSA could judge the effectiveness of the operator’s processing operation. This microbiological standard was developed following two surveys of the vast majority of registered poultry processors in NSW. These surveys demonstrated the microbiological outcomes that could be achieved by the processors. From this knowledge, a new standard for the levels of Escherichia coli (E. coli) on product were established that were to be used by the operator and the regulator to judge the effectiveness of the operator’s program. Studies into the carriage of Salmonella species on raw poultry in the plant and on the reliability of the microbiological tests being used within the survey and by industry were carried out. They found {{that there had been a}} significant reduction in carriage of Salmonella species on raw poultry from 48. 6 % to 34. 2 % over two years. The test method utilised in the survey and one utilised by the Australian industry were shown to be able to detect Salmonella Typhimurium at 1 - 3 CFU per ml <b>of</b> <b>carcase</b> rinse fluid. An examination of E. coli by PCR to determine the likelihood that E. coli carried by NSW poultry were capable of inducing Haemorrhagic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) found no evidence of shigatoxin producing genes (stx 1 or stx 2) or enterohaemorrhagic E. coli specific plasmid (ehxA). The attachment factor, intimin (eaeA) was found in E. coli from 93 <b>of</b> 430 <b>carcases</b> (21. 6 %). Campylobacter species were found on 94 % <b>of</b> all <b>carcases</b> in the first survey. A count of Campylobacter species on a series <b>of</b> <b>carcases</b> from one plant found an average of 163 CFU per cm 2 on the broiler chickens tested. Because raw poultry carry pathogens from the processing plant into the wider community, the use of two post-chill sanitisers was examined. This study found that it is possible to significantly reduce the number of pathogens being carried by raw poultry. The use of post-chill sanitisers provides a potential means of reducing the risk of foodborne illness arising from the handling of raw poultry and eating undercooked poultry meat...|$|R

40|$|Surveys {{have shown}} that {{about a quarter of}} UK pigs are {{carrying}} Salmonella at slaughter. In advance of the introduction of official controls, the British pig industry is working pro-actively on reducing Salmonella infection in pigs.

40|$|The European beef grading systems <b>of</b> EUROP and <b>Carcase</b> Fatness {{are used}} to {{determine}} carcase value throughout Europe. We investigated the relationship between EUROP class and eating quality. Six cuts (the Striploin, Outside, Rump, Tenderloin, Oyster blade and the Topside) from 18 French cattle were grilled, medium or rare. In total, 540 untrained French consumers rated the steaks for Tenderness, Flavour, Juiciness and Overall Liking, according to MSA protocols, and these scores were combined on a weighted basis (0. 3, 0. 3, 0. 1, 0. 3 respectively) to make a fifth term called Meat Quality score (MQ 4). During processing the cattle were graded using the European ‘EUROP’ and ‘Carcase Fatness’ systems. The sensory scores were analysed using a mixed linear model with cut, age and EUROP score included as fixed effects, and animal ID as a random term. Due to the low numbers <b>of</b> animals, <b>Carcase</b> Fatness scores were selected from the limited range of 3 -, 3 = and 3 + and hence do not significantly influence eating quality. In all cases, the sensory scores differed between the EUROP classes. However, these differences followed no clear linear trend across EIJROP classes within any of the cuts tested. Thus, while the EUROP system may adequately describe carcase muscling characteristics, it does not predict eating quality. The industry should consider using a system more related to eating quality to determine the monetary value <b>of</b> <b>carcases,</b> rewarding those producers supplying the meat most preferred by consumers...|$|R

However, this study highlighted the significant increases in time required to fabricate more value-added cuts and to breakdown heavier carcases. Furthermore, this study demonstrated the changes to the saleable meat yield as the degree of fabrication increased, such that the average product prices increased ($ 20. 64 /kg for mid value added and $ 28. 72 /kg for extreme value added) compared to traditional retail cuts ($ 15 /kg) to offset the increased labour of fabricating value-added cuts...|$|R
