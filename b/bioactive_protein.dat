Accordingly, appropriate pharmaceutical development is needed to maximize absorption of the protein fraction in the gastrointestinal tract. In vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo stability assays were performed to study {{the stability of the}} <b>bioactive</b> <b>protein</b> fraction in gastric conditions. The <b>bioactive</b> <b>protein</b> fraction DLBS 1033 was found to be unstable at low pH and in gastric fluid. The “enteric coating” formulation showed no leakage in gastric fluid–like medium and possessed a good release profile in simulated intestinal medium. DLBS 1033 was absorbed through the small intestine in an intact protein form, confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) analysis. This result confirmed that an enteric coating formula using methacrylic acid copolymer could protect DLBS 1033 from the acidic condition of the stomach by preventing the release of DLBS 1033 in the stomach, while promoting its release when reaching the intestine. From the blood concentration–versus-time curve, 99 mTc-DLBS 1033 showed a circulation half-life of 70 minutes. This relatively long biological half-life supports its function as a thrombolytic protein. Thus, an enteric delivery system is considered the best approach for DLBS 1033 as an oral thrombolytic agent.

40|$|Red {{kidney bean}} seeds (Phaseolus vulgaris) contain {{a variety of}} <b>bioactive</b> <b>proteins</b> {{including}} lectins, enzyme inhibitors, hydrolytic enzymes and antifungal proteins. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate activities of selected low pH and heat-stable <b>bioactive</b> <b>proteins</b> extracted from different parts of red kidney bean seed, seedling and pod as well as seed and root exudates. Crude red kidney bean seed extracts inhibited growth of Alternaria alternata as well as its protease activity, but not its amylase activity. A protein with inhibitory activity against growth of A. alternata was purified from extracts of the red kidney bean cotyledons and embryonic axis. This purified bean protein was devoid of chitinase and β- 1, 3 - glucanase activities. Also, it did not inhibit porcine pancreatic α-amylase, bovine trypsin, amylase and protease of A. alternata suggesting that the antifungal activity of the protein is not related to these activities. Proteinaceous extracts of red kidney bean cotyledons induced melanin and conidia formation in mycelium of A. alternata. A protein responsible for this conidiation inducing effect was shown {{for the first time to}} be a mannose-binding lectin which is also known as PvFRIL (Phaseolus vulgaris fetal liver tyrosine kinase 3 -receptor interacting lectin). An unexpected finding was that extracts of the embryonic axis stimulated rather than inhibited porcine α-amylase activity. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA-L in particular), co-extracted with α-amylase inhibitor from red kidney bean seeds, was implicated as an α-amylase stimulator with the potential of greatly assisting digestion of starch. In cotyledonary extracts, amylase stimulatory activity was masked by amylase inhibitory activity that was inactivated when the extracts were boiled for 10 min. An in-gel non-denaturing electrophoretic method was used to show presence of porcine α-amylase isoinhibitors in extracts of the cotyledons and embryonic axis. All other seedling parts as well as seed and root exudates had amylase stimulatory activity. Another improved non-denaturing electrophoretic method with immobilized azoalbumin was developed for in-gel detection of isoinhibitors of bovine trypsin in seed parts. It eliminates the need for both time-consuming and labourious staining, destaining or renaturation steps used in other methods. Accumulation of most of the selected <b>bioactive</b> <b>proteins</b> during seed development in different seed parts appeared to start at 20 days after flower abscission. The activities of these proteins decreased to lower levels after 11 days of germination. Besides these observed developmental changes, under abiotic (UV-C irradiation) and biotic (seedlings co-cultured with A. alternata) stress, increased activity of some of the selected <b>bioactive</b> <b>proteins</b> were detected.

MethodsProteins and other constituents in striatin were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two dimension electrophoresis, immunoblotting assay, spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography. The wound healing activity of striatin was studied in vitro using 3 T 3 fibroblast cells and in vivo using wound-induced animal model. Various parameters related to wound healing process were evaluated. ResultsStriatin contained four major bioactive proteins with approximate molecular weight of 8. 3, 10. 9, 15. 4 and 16. 7  kDa. In addition to proteins, striatin also contained amino acids (10 essential and 7 non essential amino acids), fatty acids (palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid), vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin B 6) {{and other nutrients}} (carbohydrate, dietary fiber, biotin, choline, inositol, l-carnitine, selenium) which are potential for wound healing and increasing serum albumin level. Treatment with striatin both in vitro and in vivo indicated that striatin enhanced cell proliferation. Wound-induced animal model treated with striatin showed significantly faster wound healing process, as confirmed by wound size and faster serum albumin level recovery. Although striatin does not contain albumin, this <b>bioactive</b> <b>protein</b> fraction may lead to enhanced albumin synthesis in the liver thereby maintaining the blood albumin level.

The ethanolic extract from G. australe strain KUM 60813 was selected for further protein purification {{on the basis of}} intense antibacterial activity compared to proteins from other strains tested. The protein was further isolated using ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration on Sephacryl S- 100 and Superdex 75 HR column. This resulted in a purification of a protein with a molecular weight of 16. 6 kDa, visualized on Tricine SDS PAGE. The purified protein was assessed for its antibacterial activity using microtitre broth dilution method. The protein showed inhibitory activity towards Salmonella typhi and Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 with IC 50 of 5. 21 mg/ml and 4. 04 mg/ml, respectively. It also inhibited HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase with an IC 50 of 1. 08 mg/ml and deoxyribonuclease activity towards herring sperm DNA.
