5|$|On 6 September 2012, the ECB {{announced}} to offer additional financial {{support in the}} form of some yield-lowering bond purchases (OMT), for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout program from EFSF/ESM. A eurozone country can benefit from the program if -and for as long as- it is found to suffer from stressed <b>bond</b> <b>yields</b> at excessive levels; but only at the point of time where the country possesses/regains a complete market access -and only if the country still complies with all terms in the signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreement. Countries receiving a precautionary programme rather than a sovereign bailout will, by definition, have complete market access and thus qualify for OMT support if also suffering from stressed interest rates on its government bonds. In regards of countries receiving a sovereign bailout (Ireland, Portugal and Greece), they will on the other hand not qualify for OMT support before they have regained complete market access, which will normally only happen after having received the last scheduled bailout disbursement. Despite none OMT programmes were ready to start in September/October, the financial markets straight away took notice of the additionally planned OMT packages from ECB, and started slowly to price-in a decline of both short-term and long-term interest rates in all European countries previously suffering from stressed and elevated interest levels (as OMTs were regarded as an extra potential back-stop to counter the frozen liquidity and highly stressed rates; and just the knowledge about their potential existence {{in the very near future}} helped to calm the markets).|$|E

The finding of near-unit-root effects highlights the need for careful econometric specification. Thus we formulate sovereign <b>bond</b> <b>yield</b> spreads, for eleven EMU countries against the Bund for the period 1992 : 1 - 2009 : 12, as AR(1) processes, while allowing for regime switching effects, {{along the lines of}} a Markovian probabilistic specification. Specifically, by taking into account regime switching effects we examine, rather than assume, that monetary unification affected sovereign <b>bond</b> <b>yield</b> spreads, allowing for states of higher and lower interactions to be revealed. Next, we examine the effects of several exogenous explanatory variables. Our results indicate that European sovereign bonds achieved only partial integration even before the recent financial crisis, while financial integration and financial stability are found to be interconnected. Specifically, we find evidence of different effects exercised by the same deterministic factors on sovereign <b>bond</b> <b>yield</b> spreads even before the recent crisis. Additionally, it appears that a negative relation exists between low-volatility conditions and the magnitude of effects exercised by idiosyncratic risk factors on <b>bond</b> <b>yield</b> spreads. financial integration; sovereign bond spreads; near unit root; regime shifts...|$|R

2500|$|The example {{given in}} {{the table at the}} right is known as a LIBOR curve because it is {{constructed}} using either LIBOR rates or swap rates.

[...] If one substitutes the LIBOR and swap rates with government <b>bond</b> <b>yields,</b> one arrives at what is known as a government curve, usually considered the risk free interest rate curve for the underlying currency. [...] The spread between the LIBOR or swap rate and the government bond yield, usually positive, meaning private borrowing is at a premium above government borrowing, of similar maturity is a measure of risk tolerance of the lenders.

Because of the term premium, long-term <b>bond</b> <b>yields</b> tend to be higher than short-term yields and the yield curve slopes upward.
