5|$|By Day 6 (7 October) {{first of}} the <b>bulkheads</b> {{and most of the}} middle deck beams were in place.|$|E
5|$|Corrosion, {{due to a}} lack of maintenance, {{affected}} the seals of the hatch covers and the strength of the <b>bulkheads</b> which separate holds. The corrosion is difficult to detect due to the immense size of the surfaces involved.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{watertight}} <b>bulkheads</b> extended {{well above}} the water line, they were not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling {{across the top of}} an ice cube tray. This was what happened to Titanic, which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No.6 boiler room, a total of five compartments. Titanic was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, but it could remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open to the ocean. With five compartments, the tops of the <b>bulkheads</b> would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Rock Bottom", <b>Bulkhead</b> and Arcee {{investigate}} an old Decepticon energon {{mine that}} mysteriously went back online. Miko {{runs into the}} mine, forcing <b>Bulkhead</b> to go after her. When Megatron caves in the mine, <b>Bulkhead</b> has {{to hold up the}} ceiling to save Miko. His legs start to give way eventually, and Starscream arrives to capture and deliver <b>Bulkhead</b> to Megatron. But thanks to Arcee, <b>Bulkhead</b> is saved, and Starscream is the one forced to hold up the ceiling.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bulkhead</b> is {{the name}} of an Autobot who {{transforms}} into a helicopter. According to Quickstrike's bio, he and <b>Bulkhead</b> are cousins. According to Aaron Archer, <b>Bulkhead's</b> goggles-and-mustache look was inspired by Paul Teutul Sr. from American Chopper.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the deformation and buckling characteristics of a composite, oblate <b>bulkhead</b> that has an inverted geometry and is subjected to pressure-only loading is presented for three <b>bulkhead</b> geometries and thicknesses. The effects of a stiffening support ring at the <b>bulkhead</b> to cylinder interface are also evaluated. Buckling analyses conducted using the axisymmetric shell code BOSOR 4 are discussed for several <b>bulkhead</b> configurations. These results are analytically verified using results from the Structural Analysis of General Shells (STAGS) code for a selected <b>bulkhead</b> configuration...|$|R
5|$|The Océan-class ironclads were {{designed}} by Henri Dupuy de Lôme as an improved version of the s. The ships were central battery ironclads with the armament concentrated amidships. For {{the first time in}} a French ironclad three watertight iron <b>bulkheads</b> were fitted in the hull. Like most ironclads of their era they were equipped with a metal-reinforced ram.|$|E
5|$|The s were {{designed}} as improved {{versions of the}} armored corvette , suited for foreign deployments. Unlike their predecessor, the Alma-class ships were true central battery ironclads as they were fitted with armored transverse <b>bulkheads.</b> Like most ironclads of their era, they were equipped with a metal-reinforced ram.|$|E

5000|$|In [...] "Deus ex Machina", <b>Bulkhead's</b> old nemesis Breakdown {{makes his}} {{presence}} {{known to the}} Autobots. When asked about his feud with Breakdown, <b>Bulkhead</b> only replies angrily, [...] "We have a history." [...] <b>Bulkhead</b> is defeated twice by Breakdown in the episode, but eventually subdues his nemesis with Knock Out's electric prod. <b>Bulkhead</b> doesn't have to wait long to engage his enemy again; he and Bumblebee fought and defeated Breakdown in Speed Metal, and <b>Bulkhead</b> later fought Breakdown to a stalemate with Arcee in Out of his Head.|$|R
5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with three rudders, and the armored {{pilothouse}} was mounted {{on top of}} the gun turret. The officers' staterooms were built on deck out of light pine, and a hurricane deck was positioned between the turret and the deckhouse, between the two funnels. The hull was subdivided by three transverse and three longitudinal watertight <b>bulkheads.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{rangefinder}} {{was installed}} on the bridge and her fore and aft holds were refitted as magazines. Half-inch (12.7mm) steel plating was added to protect her steering gear and her interior cabin <b>bulkheads</b> and glass ventilators were removed to reduce damage from splinters. Her furniture was removed {{to make room for}} the mess decks needed to feed large numbers of troops and sailors and an operating room and sickbay were installed amidships.|$|E
5|$|As a fleet flagship, her {{complement}} was 115 {{officers and}} 1,860 men in 1947. Air conditioning was provided {{for many of}} the ship's control spaces, and asbestos insulation was provided on exposed areas of the ship's sides, decks and <b>bulkheads.</b> Steam heating was provided for her armament, instruments, look-out positions and other equipment to make Vanguard suitable for operations in the Arctic. An Action Information Centre was fitted below the main armour deck with facilities to track aircraft and ships around Vanguard.|$|E
500|$|The ships {{would have}} had an {{internal}} torpedo bulge to provide protection against underwater explosions. This was backed by a torpedo <b>bulkhead</b> also made up of three [...] layers of HTS and angled outwards to meet {{the base of the}} waterline belt. It connected to a [...] splinter <b>bulkhead</b> on the lower deck behind the waterline belt. Behind the torpedo bulge and the splinter <b>bulkhead</b> was another splinter <b>bulkhead</b> 12.7–19mm thick.|$|R

5000|$|Hardshell is {{the fiercest}} of the Insecticons who first appears in [...] "Toxicity." [...] When Megatron asks the Insecticons {{which of them}} is the strongest of them, Hardshell states that the Insecticons are equal but he is the fiercest. Hardshell is ordered by Megatron to find the fourth and final {{artifact}} from the Iacon Vault, and leads some Insecticons to the Equator to locate the artifact. <b>Bulkhead</b> encounters and fights Hardshell, who knows the Wreckers due to killing some of its members. Hardshell proves to be a match for <b>Bulkhead</b> until he is knocked down, but leaves <b>Bulkhead</b> leaking Energon. Hardshell recovers and states that <b>Bulkhead</b> leaving him alive will be the last mistake he'll ever make. When <b>Bulkhead</b> finds the Iacon artifact, which {{turns out to be a}} cache of Tox-En (a type of deadly and poisonous Energon), Hardshell catches up and one of the Insecticons with him ends up killed by a combination of <b>Bulkhead's</b> grenade and some Tox-En. Hardshell reports to Megatron that they are after the Tox-En in the artifact and then goes after <b>Bulkhead</b> by following his leaked Energon trail. When Hardshell learns that <b>Bulkhead's</b> trail is fake and confronts the Autobot on the volcano summit, demanding the severely weakened <b>Bulkhead</b> to let them put him out of his misery. <b>Bulkhead</b> managed to expose Hardshell and his remaining Insecticons to Tox-En, weakening them, and Hardshell is knocked down a volcano shaft with the Tox-En, but survives and soon emerges to fire on <b>Bulkhead</b> as he heads into the Ground Bridge.|$|R
5|$|Captain Salmond rushed on {{deck and}} ordered the anchor to be dropped, the quarter-boats to be lowered, and a turn astern to be given by the engines. However, as the ship backed off the rock, the sea rushed into the large hole made by the {{collision}} and the ship struck again, buckling the plates of the forward bilge and ripping open the <b>bulkheads.</b> Shortly, the forward compartments and the engine rooms were flooded, and over 100 soldiers were drowned in their berths.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{returned}} to active service after the United States {{declared war on}} Germany on 6 April 1917, entering World War I. She was assigned to Division 4 of the Battleship Force, based at Tangier Sound in Chesapeake Bay. She spent the war as a training ship for gunners and engine room personnel. During this time, Vice Admiral Albert W. Grant, the commander of Battleship Force 1, instituted a program to reinforce the <b>bulkheads</b> of the ships under his command. This improved their ability to absorb underwater damage and remain afloat. On 29 September 1918, while cruising off Fenwick Island with the destroyer , she struck a naval mine that had been laid by the U-boat U-117, which inflicted serious damage but caused no casualties. The explosion tore a gaping hole in the hull from frame 5 to frame 16, and from the keel to the bottom edge of the armor belt. The bow flooded, but the repaired <b>bulkheads</b> prevented the flooding from spreading. Reduced to a speed of , Minnesota {{made it back to}} the Philadelphia Navy Yard where repairs were effected. The work lasted for five months, by which time Germany had signed the Armistice that ended the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{fuselage}} contained {{two major}} <b>bulkheads,</b> with the cockpit {{at the front}} of the first bulkhead. The nose was fitted with a rotating machine gun mount, offset to allow the pilot a better field of forward vision. The cockpit was fully glazed, with the exception of the lower right section, which acted as a platform for the bombardier-gunner. The commonly-used Lotfernrohr-series bombsight penetrated through the cockpit floor into a protective housing on the external side of the cockpit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bulkhead</b> is {{the name}} of four fictional {{characters}} from the Transformers franchise. All incarnations of <b>Bulkhead</b> are Autobots and are green in color. He was introduced in Transformers: Energon and later redebuted in Transformers: Animated as a completely new character. The Animated <b>Bulkhead</b> became so popular that he was adapted to reappear in Transformers: Prime. Whereas he was a minor character in Energon, the Animated/Prime <b>Bulkhead</b> appears as a main character in both series.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Bulkhead,</b> a 300 ft granite cliff, juts out on {{the east}} end of Ragged Mountain. A seldom-used rock {{climbing}} destination, The <b>Bulkhead</b> is also the last place peregrine falcons have nested in the Sunapee-Kearsarge region of New Hampshire. The <b>Bulkhead</b> can be reached from The <b>Bulkhead</b> Trail at the headwaters of Mitchell Brook on Proctor Academy's campus. From the Andover town green, the hike takes roughly an hour and twenty minutes.|$|R
50|$|The ships {{would have}} had an {{internal}} torpedo bulge to provide protection against underwater explosions. This was backed by a torpedo <b>bulkhead</b> also made up of three 25 mm layers of HTS and angled outwards to meet {{the base of the}} waterline belt. It connected to a 12.7 - 32 mm splinter <b>bulkhead</b> on the lower deck behind the waterline belt. Behind the torpedo bulge and the splinter <b>bulkhead</b> was another splinter <b>bulkhead</b> 12.7-19 mm thick.|$|R
5|$|The main conning {{tower was}} {{protected}} by 12 inches of armour on its sides {{and it had a}} 4-inch roof. The aft conning tower (sometimes called the torpedo control tower) had 9-inch sides and a 3-inch roof. The communications tube down from each position was 6 inches thick above the upper deck and 2 inches thick below it. Each magazine {{was protected by}} two armour plates on each side as torpedo <b>bulkheads,</b> the first one an inch thick and the second one and a half inches thick.|$|E
5|$|The {{new rules}} {{adopted in the}} 1997 annexes to the SOLAS {{convention}} focused on problems such as reinforcing <b>bulkheads</b> and the longitudinal frame, more stringent inspections (with a particular focus on corrosion) and routine in-port inspections. The 1997 additions also required bulkers with restrictions (for instance, forbidden from carrying certain types of cargoes) to mark their hulls with large, easy-to-see triangles.|$|E
5|$|These {{analyses}} are conducted when traveling empty, loading and unloading, when partially and fully loaded, and {{under conditions of}} temporary overloading. Places subject to the largest stresses are studied carefully, such as hold-bottoms, hatch-covers, <b>bulkheads</b> between holds, and the bottoms of ballast tanks. Great Lakes bulkers also must be designed to withstand springing, or developing resonance with the waves, which can cause fatigue fractures.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the deformation and buckling characteristics of a composite, oblate <b>bulkhead</b> that has an inverted geometry and is subjected to pressure-only loading is presented for three <b>bulkhead</b> geometries and thicknesses. The effects of a stiffening support ring at the <b>bulkhead</b> to cylinder interface are also evaluated. Buckling analyses conducted using the axisymmetric shell code BOSOR 4 are discussed for several <b>bulkhead</b> configurations. These results are analytically verified using results from the Structural Analysis of General Shells (STAGS) code for a selected <b>bulkhead</b> configuration. The buckling characterization of an inverted, oblate <b>bulkhead</b> requires careful attention as small changes in <b>bulkhead</b> parameters can {{have a significant effect}} on the critical buckling load. Comparison of BOSOR 4 and STAGS results provided a very good correlation between the two analysis methods. In addition, the analysis code BOSOR 4 was found to be an efficient sizing tool that is useful during the preliminary design stage of a practical shell structure. Together, these two aspects should give the design engineer confidence in sizing these stability critical structures. Additional characterization is warranted, especially for a composite tank structure, since only one <b>bulkhead</b> configuration was examined closely...|$|R
50|$|<b>Bulkhead</b> first {{appears in}} the pilot episode where he {{responds}} too late to a call for help from Cliffjumper, who is taken by the Decepticon and killed. Later when Arcee is attacked by the Decepticons <b>Bulkhead</b> and Bumblebee come to her aid and the Decepticons run away. <b>Bulkhead</b> later goes to rescue Agent Fowler, the Autobots' government liaison, from Starscream, only for Miko, Raf, and Jack to follow him and be put in danger. Optimus later scolded <b>Bulkhead</b> for endangering the humans, but it is revealed in the next episode that <b>Bulkhead's</b> damage to the Decepticons' ship stopped Megatron from locking onto Cybertron with his Space Bridge.|$|R
50|$|According to some, Lugnut is a Decepticon {{version of}} <b>Bulkhead,</b> minus <b>Bulkhead's</b> kind nature and heart of gold, and an undying loyalty to Megatron.|$|R
5|$|Titanics lower decks {{were divided}} into sixteen {{compartment}}s. Each compartment was separated from its neighbour by a bulkhead running {{the width of the}} ship; there were fifteen <b>bulkheads</b> in all. Each bulkhead extended at least to the underside of E Deck, nominally one deck, or about , above the waterline. The two nearest the bow and the six nearest the stern went one deck further up.|$|E
5|$|Early on 8 July, U-255 caught another {{ship from}} Convoy PQ 17, the 6,069 ton American {{merchant}} ship Olopana, loaded with 6,000 tons of explosives, gasoline, and trucks as deck cargo. A single torpedo hit the ship, blowing {{out all the}} <b>bulkheads,</b> and killing seven of the crew. The surviving crewmen abandoned ship on four rafts, as U-255 surfaced and fired 20 shells at the ship, which sank after 20 minutes. U-255 questioned the survivors, gave them a course to land, {{and asked if they}} had enough food and water before leaving. The survivors landed at Moller Bay, Novaya Zemlya, two days later.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 {{documentary}} , {{directed by}} James Cameron and filmed in May–June 2002 using {{smaller and more}} agile Mir submersibles, reconstructed the events leading to the sinking. These provided the first interior shots. His findings were {{that there was not}} enough damage below the waterline to confirm that she had been sunk rather than scuttled. Close inspection of the wreckage confirmed that none of the torpedoes or shells had penetrated the second layer of the inner hull. Using small ROVs to examine the interior, Cameron discovered that the torpedo blasts had failed to shatter the torpedo <b>bulkheads.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Darkness Rising: Part 3", Arcee {{went out}} on patrol, after Optimus {{told her she was}} in charge of the base while he was with Ratchet, because she didn't want to babysit the kids. She took Bumblebee with her, leaving <b>Bulkhead</b> in charge of the kids. Arcee and Bumblebee drove around, before being {{contacted}} by <b>Bulkhead.</b> She was forced to go to <b>Bulkhead's</b> location after she found out the Decepticons had captured Agent Fowler (and that Miko had sneaked along with <b>Bulkhead).</b>|$|R
500|$|The O-class {{ships were}} to be {{protected}} by Krupp Wotan steel armor. The main armored belt was [...] thick in the most critical areas of the ship, including the machinery spaces and ammunition magazines, and [...] in other less important areas; the armor tapered to zero at the stern and bow of the ship. A torpedo <b>bulkhead</b> {{ran the length of}} the hull; the <b>bulkhead</b> was [...] thick for the majority of its length. A second <b>bulkhead</b> was placed in the central portion of the ship. The <b>bulkhead</b> was [...] thick but increased to [...] in the more important portions of the ship. Critical areas were further protected by 80mm-thick shields set back from the torpedo <b>bulkhead.</b> All of the lateral armor protection was Wotan Hart steel, {{with the exception of the}} torpedo <b>bulkhead,</b> which was Wotan Weich.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Operation: Breakdown", {{following}} his defeat in another clash against Breakdown, his nemesis is captured by human terrorist group MECH. <b>Bulkhead</b> stubbornly refuses {{to help his}} nemesis, explaining to Miko that their history goes a long time back, and that he simply cannot forgive Breakdown for the things he's done. Miko convinces {{him that if he}} doesn't go after Breakdown he has no chance to avenge his earlier defeat. <b>Bulkhead</b> eventually fights his way to Breakdown and together they fight their way out of MECH's lair, and fight back to back to fend off the hordes of MECH troops. During the battle, much to <b>Bulkhead's</b> surprise, Breakdown pushes him out of the way from a paralyzing blast from MECH. Starscream arrives, and urges Breakdown to kill <b>Bulkhead</b> regardless of their teamwork, and Breakdown nearly does so, but <b>Bulkhead</b> single-handedly defeats most of the Decepticons present. Optimus commends <b>Bulkhead</b> for [...] "rising above himself" [...] to save Breakdown, but <b>Bulkhead</b> was more happy he defeated all the Decepticons present so swiftly.|$|R
