5|$|Author Michael Bradley {{and friend}} Deanna Theilmann-Beann searched for Mussie in the Nepenthe, a boat with sonar technology. With their sonar, they found two creatures they {{hypothesized}} could be two marine mammals, three metres long. Bradley concluded {{that at least}} one creature compatible with Mussie's description lived in the lake, though he did not investigate the creatures further. Scientists have also surveyed the area and found nothing, though the definitive nonexistence of a Mussie-like creature is difficult to establish <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trenches in Muskrat Lake extend to over 60 metres.|$|E
5|$|That same year, J.J. Thomson {{conducted}} {{an experiment in}} which he channeled a stream of neon ions through magnetic and electric fields, striking a photographic plate at the other end. He observed two glowing patches on the plate, which suggested two different deflection trajectories. Thomson concluded this was <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neon ions had a different mass. The nature of this differing mass would later {{be explained by the}} discovery of neutrons in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Despite these precautions, {{pollution}} {{from the power}} stations was still a factor. In 1954, consideration was given to scrapping the plan to build the Union Hall housing estate in Lemington because of probable {{pollution from}} nearby power stations. This was mainly <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> houses were as high as, if not higher than, the power stations' chimneys. At times, this meant the estate being exposed {{to as much as}} 1.25 parts per million of sulphur dioxide. However the estate was still built, as these peak conditions were thought unlikely to occur on more than 18 days in a year.|$|E
50|$|Interestingly, Mr.Patil has one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longest {{affidavits}} {{submitted to}} <b>the</b> Election Commission <b>of</b> India <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aforementioned cases {{which are still}} pending in various courts.|$|R
50|$|His {{writings}} are now lost, {{though there}} is a (probably fictitious) work occasionally attributed to him titled De peregrinis regionibus. This is likely <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> confusion over his identity.|$|R
5000|$|Because bencoded files contain binary data, and <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intricacies {{involved}} in the way binary strings are typically stored, it is often not safe to edit bencode files in text editors.|$|R
5|$|On 30 August, Furious left Belfast with {{a load of}} 49 Hurricanes, {{carrying}} three Fulmars of 800 Squadron {{and four}} Sea Hurricane IBs of 880A Squadron for self-defence, and nine Swordfish of 812 Squadron for Ark Royal. She arrived in Gibraltar on 6 September and transferred 40 Hurricanes to the other carrier the next day. Ark Royal sailed for the departure point the following day, but could only fly off 14 Hurricanes <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bristol Blenheim bombers used to guide the fighters to Malta failed to make their rendezvous. When Ark Royal returned, she transferred the six Swordfish of 810 Squadron to Furious and both carriers departed that same day to deliver the Hurricanes. This was Furiouss last ferry mission as she was sent to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for a lengthy refit. She arrived on 7 October and {{did not return to}} the United Kingdom until April 1942.|$|E
5|$|American {{scientists}} {{thought the}} missing {{body to be}} Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, {{that they would have}} expected to find in the seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga. However, the heights of the skeletons had to be estimated <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing. Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of the skeletons, the Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave because none of the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists.|$|E
5|$|List of United States {{business}} school rankings is a tabular listing {{of some of}} the {{business school}}s and their affiliated universities located in the United States that are included in {{one or more of the}} rankings of full-time Master of Business Administration programs. Rankings are typically published by magazines or websites. This list is not a comprehensive list of business schools in the United States. These rankings are a subset of college and university rankings. Business schools are university-level institutions generally affiliated with a university or college that produces students who attain business administration degrees. Most of the schools listed in the rankings below are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Some of the publications shown here have related rankings for undergraduate, part-time and executive curricula. There is currently some controversy among faculty and administrators in American institutions of higher education regarding the request by the surveyors to have college presidents give their subjective opinion of other colleges <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> methodologies are deemed misleading and a disservice. This has resulted in a movement surrounding the President's letter.|$|E
50|$|This {{amplitude}} modulation (and vestigial SSB modulation) energy-saving mode was devised {{in the late}} 1930s. DCC was not implemented in transmitter designs until <b>the</b> 1980s, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complexities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control circuit.|$|R

50|$|The {{book was}} met with {{controversy}} <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revelations it contains.

5|$|On 12November 1945, at {{the first}} general meeting of army leadership, General Sudirman– {{the leader of the}} Fifth Division in Purwokerto, who had two years {{military}} experience and was 23 years younger than Oerip– was elected leader of the army following two deadlocked votes. In the third round, Oerip had 21votes to Sudirman's 22. Divisional commanders from Sumatra, who had voted unanimously, swayed the vote in Sudirman's favour; Oerip had lost votes <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> division leaders distrusted his history with the KNIL and the oath he had taken to the Dutch motherland upon graduation. Although Sudirman was surprised at his selection and offered to surrender the leadership position to Oerip, the meeting did not allow it; Oerip himself was glad to no longer {{be in charge of the}} army. Sudirman kept Oerip, by then a lieutenant general, to serve as chief of staff under him. While Sudirman remained unconfirmed, Oerip remained de jure leader; however, the Indonesian journalist Salim Said writes that Oerip's orders were at times unintelligible owing to the leader's poor command of Indonesian and often ignored unless approved by Sudirman.|$|E

50|$|A {{biography}} of Güney, Halkın Sanatçısı, Halkın Savaşçısı: Yılmaz Güney, {{was published by}} Dönüşüm Publishing in 1992, and reprinted in 2000. Its publisher was fined in 2001 <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book's content, although this was overturned in 2003 when the relevant law was repealed.|$|R
25|$|However, criticisms {{have been}} raised, for {{instance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phonological-loop component, <b>because</b> <b>some</b> details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> findings {{are not easily}} explained by the original Baddeley & Hitch model.|$|R
25|$|In 2016, a case {{involving}} a family of 5 in Australia made headlines when they abruptly fled their home and traveled more than 1,600 km <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family had become convinced someone was out to kill and rob them. No such evidence was found by the police.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{addressed}} {{whether the}} Rhode Island Supreme Court erred in holding that Petitioner {{did not have}} standing to claim a regulatory taking because he acquired the property after the enactment of regulations, and that Petitioner did not endure a total taking <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parcel remains economically usable.|$|E
25|$|However {{this will}} not work <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{programs}} p tested will not terminate, e.g. if they contain infinite loops.

50|$|It is {{also argued}} that many {{juvenile}} jurisdictions are no longer taking a rehabilitative approach to juvenile delinquents, and are instead {{becoming more and more}} punitive, and that <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modifications within the juvenile justice system (e.g. required to waive access to a jury of peers) these defendants are losing out on chances for better advocacy and they are not receiving all their rights as a trial defendant.|$|R

25|$|The pitch {{itself had}} become slower and slower. Some {{observers}} {{said that it}} was useless to bowlers and batsmen alike.

25|$|For {{several years}} {{following}} the eruption, {{it was reported that}} the moon appeared to be blue and sometimes green. This was <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ash clouds were filled with particles about 1µm wide—the right size to strongly scatter red light, while allowing other colors to pass. White moonbeams shining through the clouds emerged blue, and sometimes green.|$|E
25|$|Because the Roma are {{traditionally}} a private {{people with a}} culture based on oral history, less is known about their experience during the Holocaust than {{that of any other}} group. Bauer writes that this {{can be attributed to the}} Roma's distrust and suspicion, and to their humiliation, <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> taboos in Romani culture regarding hygiene and sex were violated at Auschwitz.|$|E
50|$|However, Raymond Lauchengco, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} five lead actors, {{said the}} film {{will not be}} done at all <b>because</b> <b>some</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cast {{no longer had the}} appetite to see it through.|$|R
50|$|As for Ghani Khan, he was {{initially}} influenced by his father’s political struggles and thus worked for <b>the</b> independence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pashtuns ruled by British India. However, he later came {{to disagree with}} his father’s ideologies (he stopped supporting <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> non-violent resistance, seeing {{that it was not}} beneficial to the Pashtuns). He says, in an interview, that he left his father’s political movement of non-violence, called “Khudai Khidmatgar” (“God’s Soldiers”) <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movement’s motives that he disagreed with.|$|R
50|$|When Chen {{informed}} violentacrez {{about the}} impending exposé, he pleaded with Chen {{not to publish}} {{it because he was}} concerned about the potential impact on his employment and finances, noting that his wife was disabled and he had a mortgage to pay.

25|$|Hydrogen can be {{generated}} from energy supplied {{in the form of}} heat and electricity through high-temperature electrolysis (HTE). <b>Because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy in HTE is supplied in the form of heat, less of the energy must be converted twice (from heat to electricity, and then to chemical form), and so potentially far less energy is required per kilogram of hydrogen produced.|$|E
25|$|Most {{sanitation}} {{systems have}} been designed with the five aspects in mind, but in practice they are failing far too often <b>because</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> criteria are not met.

25|$|In {{areas where}} it has been {{introduced}} outside of its native range, V. rotundifolia has proven to be an invasive species. This plant dominates dune ecosystems leading to a reduction in the prevalence of native species.
