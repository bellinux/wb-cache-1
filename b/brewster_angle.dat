25|$|Note {{that this}} {{principle}} only holds strictly for light reflected at normal incidence. For instance, right circularly polarized light reflected from a dielectric surface at grazing incidence (an angle beyond the <b>Brewster</b> <b>angle)</b> will still emerge as right handed, but elliptically, polarized. Light reflected by a metal at non-normal incidence will generally have its ellipticity changed as well. Such situations may {{be solved by}} decomposing the incident circular (or other) polarization into components of linear polarization parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, commonly denoted p and s respectively. The reflected components in the p and s linear polarizations are found by applying the Fresnel coefficients of reflection, which are generally different for those two linear polarizations. Only in the special case of normal incidence, {{where there is no}} distinction between p and s, are the Fresnel coefficients for the two components identical, leading to the above property.|$|E
2500|$|Any light {{striking}} a surface {{at a special}} angle of incidence known as Brewster's angle, where the reflection coefficient for p polarization is zero, will be reflected with only the s-polarization remaining. This principle is employed in the so-called [...] "pile of plates polarizer" [...] (see figure) in which part of the s polarization is removed by reflection at each <b>Brewster</b> <b>angle</b> surface, leaving only the p polarization after transmission through many such surfaces. The generally smaller reflection coefficient of the p polarization is also the basis of polarized sunglasses; by blocking the s (horizontal) polarization, most of the glare due to reflection from a wet street, for instance, is removed.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is used as}} an {{infrared}} optical material with a remarkably wide transmission wavelength range (0.45µm to 21.5µm). The refractive index is about 2.67 at 550nm (green), and about 2.40 at 10.6µm (LWIR). Similar to zinc sulfide, ZnSe is produced as microcrystalline sheets by synthesis from hydrogen selenide gas and zinc vapour. Another method of producing is a growth from melt under excessive pressure of inert gas (Ar usually). When free of absorption and inclusions it is ideally suited for CO2 laser optics at 10.6µm wavelength. It is thus a very important IR material. In daily life, {{it can be found}} as the entrance optic in the new range of [...] "in-ear" [...] clinical thermometers, seen as a small yellow window. Zinc selenide can slowly react with atmospheric moisture if poorly polished, but this is not generally a serious problem.

50|$|A <b>Brewster</b> <b>angle</b> {{microscope}} (BAM) is {{a microscope}} for studying thin films on liquid surfaces, most typically Langmuir films. In a <b>Brewster</b> <b>angle</b> microscope, both the microscope and a polarized light source are aimed towards a liquid surface at that liquid's <b>Brewster</b> <b>angle,</b> {{in such a}} way for the microscope to catch an image of any light reflected from the light source via the liquid surface. Because there is no p-polarized reflection from the pure liquid when both are angled towards it at the <b>Brewster</b> <b>angle,</b> light is only reflected when some other phenomenon such as a surface film affects the liquid surface. The technique was first introduced in 1991.|$|E
