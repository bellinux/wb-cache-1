Above the blower is a thick piece of steel that covers the blower and seals the top section of the air box. On a turbocharged engine an intercooler and sometimes a by-pass housing is present with the intercooler housing.

40|$|AbstractIn a Metal-to-Metal Contact (MMC) <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joint {{the stress}} of sealing {{surfaces}} is constant. It canwithstand higherbolt load. So, under the operating conditions of high temperature, high pressure or their fluctuations, the sealing effect of MMC <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints is better than of floating (FLT) <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints. According to the structure characteristics of MMC <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints, a new tightening method (SH-Method) was recommended in this work. The bolt forces during the tightening process of a MMC <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joint with SH-Method were calculated and analyzed with the finite element analysis Software ANSYS.

It is said that lubricant on the screw of the bolts and the nut-seating surface can minimize the variability of axial force acting on <b>flange</b> <b>bolts,</b> while this process might {{make it harder to}} tight the bolts uniformly especially for small bore low rating flanges.

40|$|Bolted {{flanged joints}} {{comprise}} an assembly {{of a number}} of important individual components, which are required to perform well together in service. The ideal requirement for a <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joint is a 'zero-leak' condition. However, whilst recommended design procedures for <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints are available in international codes and standards, leakage problems are still faced by industry. These are common in both normal operating (internal pressure loading) and critical event conditions. The drive is, therefore, to find a flange joint assembly, which provides 'zero-leak condition' and requires little or no maintenance and handling. Considerable investigation in the area of optimised bolted joints has been in progress for the past 10 years comparing traditional gasketed joints and 'compact non-gasketed' joints, using both analytical and experimental approaches. In this present study, two-dimensional non-linear finite element studies have been performed for both gasketed and non-gasketed <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> pipe joints.

40|$|The {{failure of}} sealing {{system of the}} <b>bolt</b> <b>flange</b> {{connections}} is the primary failure mode of the nuclear reactor pressure vessel (RPV). For the safety and integrity of RPV, {{it is important to}} predict the sealing behaviour of the <b>bolt</b> <b>flange</b> connections under various loading conditions. Based on the finite element (FE) method for coupled thermal elastoplastic contact problems, a three-dimensional (3 D) transient sealing analysis program of nuclear reactor pressure vessels is developed with the consideration of the non-linearity from both surface and material, transient heat transfer and multiple coupled effects.

40|$|<b>Bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints form {{a part of}} {{pressure}} vessels and piping components, and are used extensively in the chemical, petrochemical and nuclear power industries. They are simple structures and offer the possibility of disassembly, making them attractive for connecting pressurized equipment and piping. In addition of being prone to leakage, they often require maintenance while in operation, {{in which case the}} bolts are either retightened, as in hot torquing, or untightened for replacement. Although such maintenance work prevents costly shutdowns, it can nevertheless expose the operator to a potential risk because altering the bolt load can produce a gasket load unbalance, which results in a local gasket contact stress drop below a critical value, causing a major leak, and putting the operator’s life at risk. This proposal addresses flange deflection variation as it investigates the flange contact stress level unbalance around the <b>flange</b> when the <b>bolts</b> are subjected to a load alteration during operation. This study may serve to help limit the degree of load increase in hot torquing or the maximum number of bolts to be replaced at a time, and to identify the <b>flanges</b> whose <b>bolts</b> cannot be replaced while they are in operation. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine a theoretical approach for identifying and analyzing the effects of initial bolt-up and pressurization on the <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints, in order to obtain a solution for bolt spacing calculation, according to different gasket contact stress variation levels. Our research breaks down into three parts.

Finite element model of symmetry <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints is created for use in evaluating the analysis.

40|$|After a {{comparatively}} short half century, PolyVinyl Chloride (PVC) has invaded almost all applications of traditional materials, such as clay, cast iron, steel and asbestos cement, and becomes the premier pipe material. PVC is {{popular due to}} its advantages of immunity to corrosion and biological resistance. Convenient installation and handling are also two contributing factors to its popularity. PVC Piping systems {{have been widely used}} for fluids conveyance in industrial and building sites and household. <b>Bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints are important components of piping systems. They are mainly used as dismountable connections between pressure equipment ensuring structural integrity and leakage tightness. Meanwhile, the flange is a recommended mean to connect equipment of different materials. As other plastic materials, PVC also experience creep over time, the rate of which is influenced by load and temperature. Polyvinyl Chloride <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints undergo relaxation under compression for which the creep properties are different from those under tension. The sealing performance of a flange connection is impacted by its capacity to resist relaxation. For the purpose of improving the load currying capability and reduce leakage failures of PVC flange joints, it is important to properly understand and predict their creep-relaxation behavior. The first objective of this work is to develop a PVC creep model based on creep test data obtained at various compressive loads and temperatures.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{high-rise}} latticed tower structures {{are made of}} steel tubular members. To facilitate the construction, the tower legs are constructed by connecting the steel tubular members with <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints. Under the wind load, the <b>bolts</b> of the <b>flange</b> joints may loosen; and this may endanger {{the safety of the}} tower if the bolt looseness and its locations cannot be detected and repaired timely. This paper proposes a new method for identifying the damage locations of bolt looseness of <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints at tower legs based on the abrupt changes of the structural responses of the towers to the wind load. The bolt looseness is reflected by the reduction of the bending rigidity of elements in the stiffness matrix of the beam element model which is equivalent to the refined solid finite element model of the flange joints. A vector composed of the standardized mean square deviations of the wind-induced longitudinal strain responses at flange joints in a damaged state of the tower related to those in its undamaged state is used as a damage index. It has been shown that the damage index is sensitive to the damage locations but independent of the wind load. Hence. the damage index can be used to identify the damage locations of the bolt looseness at the flange joints. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a latticed steel tubular tower, which shows that the proposed method can accurately identify the damage locations of bolt looseness.
