5|$|In the {{entertainment}} sector various ploys {{were used to}} attract tourists. In 1920 an annual <b>beauty</b> <b>contest,</b> named the Pageant of Pulchritude (also known as the Miss Universe contest) in 1926, was started in Galveston by C.E. Barfield, manager of a local amusement park owned by the Maceos. The contest was part of Splash Day, the kick-off of the summer tourist season each year, {{and became the first}} international <b>beauty</b> <b>contest,</b> attracting participants from England, Russia, Turkey, and many other nations until its demise in 1932. This contest is said to have served {{as a model for the}} modern Miss America pageant and others. At its height the pageant tripled the island's population the weekend it ran. Even after the international contest's closing, Splash Day was revived in various forms and continued to attract tourists. Other annual events included an extravagant Mardi Gras celebration in spring. The grand Buccaneer Hotel was constructed in 1929 creating an additional hotel landmark to compete with the Galvez (in addition to many other smaller hotel venues).|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode, Leslie (Amy Poehler) proudly announces to the parks and recreation staff that she will be judging the Miss Pawnee beauty pageant, a job she takes very seriously. Tom (Aziz Ansari), excited at the prospective of judging women {{on the basis of their}} looks, pulls some strings to get a spot on the judging panel along with Leslie. April (Aubrey Plaza) enters the contest in order to win the $600 prize, despite being disgusted with the concept of a <b>beauty</b> <b>contest.</b> She tries, unsuccessfully, to gain an advantage by sucking up to Leslie. Later, Pawnee police officer Dave Sanderson (Louis C.K.) visits Leslie at work to ask her out on a date. She initially accepts, but when Dave mistakes a photo of Madeleine Albright for Leslie's grandmother, Leslie becomes reluctant.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Eric Morley {{organized}} the Festival Bikini Contest, a <b>beauty</b> <b>contest</b> and swimwear advertising opportunity at that year's Festival of Britain. The press, welcoming the spectacle, {{referred to it}} as Miss World, a name Morley registered as a trademark. The winner was Kiki Håkansson of Sweden, who was crowned in a bikini. After the crowning, Håkansson was condemned by Pope Pius XII, while Spain and Ireland threatened to withdraw from the pageant. In 1952, bikinis were banned from the pageant and replaced by evening gowns. As a result of the controversy, the bikini was explicitly banned from many other beauty pageants worldwide. Though some regarded the bikini and beauty contests as bringing freedom to women, they were opposed by some feminists as well as religious and cultural groups who objected to the degree of exposure of the female body.|$|E
5|$|The ao dai is {{featured}} in {{an array of}} Vietnam-themed or related movies. In Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), Robin Williams's character is wowed by ao dai-clad women when he first arrives in Saigon. The 1992 films Indochine and The Lover inspired several international fashion houses to design ao dai collections, including Prada's SS08 collection and a Georgio Armani collection. In the Vietnamese film The White Silk Dress (2007), an ao dai is the sole legacy that the mother of a poverty-stricken family has to pass on to her daughters. The Hanoi City Complex, a 65-story building now under construction, will have an ao dai-inspired design. Vietnamese designers created ao dai for the contestants in the Miss Universe <b>beauty</b> <b>contest,</b> which was held July 2008 in Nha Trang, Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Her {{aspiration}} for fame commenced after she met Angel Anden and {{was asked to}} be a cover girl of the Valentine issue of the magazine (printed on Feb 15, 1953) called This Week (now, Chronical Magazine), where Anden was the editor. Imelda {{was not able to}} get an approval and acquire a sponsorship to participate in the Miss Manila contest from her cousins (Danieling, Eduardo, and Loreto), but, with the help of Adoracion, gained a sponsorship from Philippine Women's University after a meeting {{with the president of the}} university, Mrs. Francisca Benitez. The controversial Miss Manila beauty pageant dawned on Mar 1, 1953, when Imelda and the Reyes spouses were in great despair after hearing news that Norma Jimenez became the candidate of Miss Philippines and the winner of Miss Manila, and sought to meet the mayor of Manila, Aresenio Lacson, who revoked the decision and made Imelda Romualdez the winner of Miss Manila. The mayor announced that there were violations of rules by the International Fair Board, and it is the mayor's authority to nominate the candidate of the City of Manila for the <b>beauty</b> <b>contest.</b> It turned out that Imelda won 655 points whereas Norma Jimenez acquired 453 points. Both Imelda and Norma participated in Miss Philippines; however, the winner of Miss Philippines was Cristina Galang (Caedo, now) from Tarlac, who became one of the members of Imelda's band of women campaigners, Blue Ladies.|$|E

40|$|McMillan's (1995) 'flexibility' {{proposition}} {{suggests a}} testable hypothesis about <b>beauty</b> <b>contests</b> spectrum assignments. Such flexibility purportedly allows regulators to pursue social welfare (network deployment) goals. A separate {{argument is that}} more competitive <b>beauty</b> <b>contests</b> enhance the probability of assignment. The study concludes that regulators do indeed focus on societal (network deployment) welfare goals. Initially, consideration is given in the immediate term where licenses are awarded based on operator aftermarket commitments. Subsequently, spectrum package attributes and financial performance obligations, specified in the tender documents, come into play to support the networks spread more widely through the population in a timely manner. Finally, the econometric results suggest that more competitive <b>beauty</b> <b>contests</b> enhance the probability of assignment...|$|R

25|$|<b>Beauty</b> <b>contests</b> {{have been}} criticised for {{reinforcing}} {{the idea that}} girls and women should be valued primarily for their physical appearance.

40|$|I {{study the}} {{allocation}} of licenses to operate an oligopolistic market characterized by high demand uncertainty. The model is motivated by recent experiences of spectrum licensing for new telecommunication technologies. Demand is uncertain {{at the time of}} investment (roll-out). Firms rely on credit both to invest and to acquire the license. Under symmetry, and {{as a consequence of the}} possibility of default, firms investment is decreasing in the debt inherited from the licenseassignment stage. We compare auctions and <b>beauty</b> <b>contests.</b> Auctions extract a higher license price, and then lower investment. From a planner s point of view, <b>beauty</b> <b>contests</b> dominate auctions when the revenue motive is unimportant and influence activities are not too wasteful. Auctions, licenses, <b>beauty</b> <b>contests,</b> limited liability. ...|$|R
