5|$|The note {{appears to}} have {{originally}} been signed, but the name was torn off or burned off so that her <b>body</b> <b>could</b> not be identified. When the announcement was printed in the local newspaper, The Cambrian, therefore, it did not refer to Imlay specifically.|$|E
5|$|The {{reality was}} very different. Lody's body {{was buried in}} an unmarked common grave in the East London Cemetery in Plaistow along with {{seventeen}} other men– ten executed spies and seven prisoners who died of ill-health or accidents. It was not until 1924 that the grave received a marker, at the instigation of the German Embassy. Lody's relatives were visiting it once a year and enquired whether his <b>body</b> <b>could</b> be exhumed and buried in a private grave. The War Office agreed, providing that the <b>body</b> <b>could</b> be identified, but the Foreign Office was more reluctant and pointed out that a licence for exhumation {{would have to be}} authorised by the Home Office. The Lody family placed a white headstone and kerb on the grave some time around 1934.|$|E
5|$|As {{public concern}} over the {{accident}} grew while information and education was limited, misconceptions arose {{about the nature of}} radiation hazards. Residents near a Buddhist temple protested and prevented the cremation of one of the victims, believing that the <b>body</b> <b>could</b> spread radiation, despite assurances by the OAEP to the contrary.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 the Westray Wife, a lozenge-shaped figurine that is {{believed}} to be the earliest representation of a human face found in Scotland, was discovered at the site of a Neolithic village at Links of Noltland near Grobust Bay on the north coast of Westray. The figurine's face has two dots for eyes, heavy brows and an oblong nose and a pattern of hatches on the <b>body</b> <b>could</b> represent clothing. Two figurines were subsequently found at the site in 2010 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{relations}} between the Assembly and the Council and the competencies of each were {{for the most part}} not explicitly defined. Each <b>body</b> <b>could</b> deal with any matter within the sphere of competence of the League or affecting peace in the world. Particular questions or tasks might be referred to either.|$|E
5|$|Even before Neptune's discovery, some {{speculated that}} one planet alone {{was not enough}} to explain the discrepancy. On 17 November 1834, the British amateur {{astronomer}} the Reverend Thomas John Hussey reported a conversation he had had with French astronomer Alexis Bouvard to George Biddell Airy, the British Astronomer Royal. Hussey reported that when he suggested to Bouvard that the unusual motion of Uranus might be due to the gravitational influence of an undiscovered planet, Bouvard replied that the idea had occurred to him, and that he had corresponded with Peter Andreas Hansen, director of the Seeberg Observatory in Gotha, about the subject. Hansen's opinion was that a single <b>body</b> <b>could</b> not adequately explain the motion of Uranus, and postulated that two planets lay beyond Uranus.|$|E
25|$|However, the Nigerian AAIB {{claimed that}} not every bodies were {{identified}}. At least 3 <b>bodies</b> <b>could</b> not be identified by forensic team.|$|R
50|$|Certain <b>bodies</b> <b>could</b> {{not be part}} of a LINk, {{these include}} National Health Service trusts, NHS {{foundation}} trusts, NHS primary care trusts and strategic health authorities.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} but few went out, {{for the general}} feeling was, that the <b>bodies</b> <b>could</b> not be {{discovered}} until the thaw came, and at present it was freezing sharply.|$|R
5|$|However, Osborn had {{no control}} over his Super-Adaptoid abilities; he would {{automatically}} absorb the powers of any superhuman he touched, even if he did not consciously want to. He was also limited in how many powers his <b>body</b> <b>could</b> hold, as the A.I.M. scientists warned him that absorbing too many powers at once could overload his systems. In the end, he inadvertently absorbed the abilities of all the Avengers and New Avengers when they all touched him at once, and the unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage to his body chemistry, resulting in him going into a coma. After he regained consciousness, these powers were apparently burnt out, returning him to his Goblin-level strength instead.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board {{concluded}} that the severity of Frank's injuries and the numerous particulates found embedded in his <b>body</b> <b>could</b> only be attributed to his proximity to an explosion. Furthermore, the chemical compounds detected {{in the area around}} the explosion's point of origin were consistent with those generated by a dynamite explosion. The manganese dioxide samples collected from the seats near the focal point and from Frank's body indicated that a dry cell battery was located very near to the explosive. The CAB determined that, based on the blast pattern, a dynamite charge had been placed underneath the window seat of row 7.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 2 passed {{closer to}} Enceladus (87,010km) on August 26, 1981, {{allowing}} higher-resolution images to be obtained. These images showed a young surface. They also revealed a surface with different regions with vastly different surface ages, with a heavily cratered mid- to high-northern latitude region, and a lightly cratered region {{closer to the}} equator. This geologic diversity contrasts with the ancient, heavily cratered surface of Mimas, another moon of Saturn slightly smaller than Enceladus. The geologically youthful terrains came as a great surprise to the scientific community, because no theory was then able to predict that such a small (and cold, compared to Jupiter's highly active moon Io) celestial <b>body</b> <b>could</b> bear signs of such activity.|$|E
50|$|The G8 also {{frequently}} issues public statements as to exchange rates. In the past {{due to the}} Plaza Accord, its predecessor <b>bodies</b> <b>could</b> directly manipulate rates to reverse large trade deficits.|$|R
50|$|Under Martin Abrams' direction, {{the company}} shifted its {{production}} to action figures with interchangeable <b>bodies.</b> Generic <b>bodies</b> <b>could</b> be mass-produced and different figures created by interposing different heads and costumes on them.|$|R
60|$|In {{half an hour}} {{they were}} able to say with {{tolerable}} certainty that no human beings had been burned, for the <b>bodies</b> <b>could</b> not have been wholly consumed in such a speedy conflagration.|$|R
5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a foetal position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the <b>body</b> <b>could</b> feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Tillman accused {{his junior}} {{colleague}} from South Carolina, John L. McLaurin, {{of corruption in}} a speech to the Senate. McLaurin, who had been a Tillmanite before breaking from him after being elected to the Senate, called him a liar, whereupon Tillman rushed across the Senate floor and punched McLaurin in the face. McLaurin reciprocated, giving Tillman a bloody nose before the Sergeant at Arms and senators intervened. The body immediately went into closed session, and held both men in contempt. The Senate considered suspending them, but Tillman argued that it was unfair to deprive South Carolina of her representation, though the <b>body</b> <b>could</b> certainly expel the two men—knowing he had enough Democratic votes to prevent it. In the end, both men were censured, and later that year, Tillman arranged for McLaurin, whose term ended in 1903, to not be re-elected.|$|E

5000|$|The grave goods found {{along with}} the <b>bodies</b> <b>could</b> be {{interpreted}} as a form of respect to the family of the dead (Barretto 2002). The family's grief was another probable explanation for high-valued goods.(Macdonald 2001) ...|$|R
50|$|This {{memorial}} commemorates over 250 troops {{killed in}} action in British Malaya whose graves, whilst known, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission were unable to maintain and whose <b>bodies</b> <b>could</b> not be moved due to religious conviction.|$|R
50|$|A {{meeting was}} called by {{officials}} of the S.A.A.& H.S. for Saturday 27 April 1844 to resolve the situation that, even if the two <b>bodies</b> <b>could</b> coexist, the similarity of their titles would be confusing to the public.|$|R
25|$|Because people {{believed}} that the quantity of humors in the <b>body</b> <b>could</b> not be replenished, there were folk-medical beliefs {{that the loss of}} fluids was a form of death.|$|E
25|$|It {{also can}} be {{referred}} to as the radial distance from a given axis at which the mass of a <b>body</b> <b>could</b> be concentrated without altering the rotational inertia of the body about that axis.|$|E
25|$|The tomb is {{carved from}} the solid {{limestone}} bedrock. Within are six kokhim, or burial shafts and two arcosolia, or arched shelves where a <b>body</b> <b>could</b> be {{laid out for}} entombment. The ossuaries were found within the shafts.|$|E
50|$|Men or {{employers}} who objected to an individual's call-up {{could apply to}} a local Military Service Tribunal. These <b>bodies</b> <b>could</b> grant exemption from service, usually conditional or temporary. There was right of appeal to a County Appeal Tribunal.|$|R
50|$|The {{manufacturing}} process {{was not yet}} fully understood. On 14 July 1847 a serious explosion killed 18 staff, only 10 of whose <b>bodies</b> <b>could</b> be identified. As {{a result of the}} blast, the factory owners shut the plant.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the extreme}} heat of the fire, only a few <b>bodies</b> <b>could</b> be {{positively}} identified. Thirty-nine unidentified victims were buried in a ceremony at Brockton's Melrose Cemetery three days later. The disaster's 58th victim, Hiram Pierce, died on April 15.|$|R
25|$|In 2004, Browne {{said that}} Ryan Katcher, a 19-year-old who had {{disappeared}} in 2000, had been murdered, and his <b>body</b> <b>could</b> {{be found in}} a metal shaft. In 2006, Katcher's body was found in his truck {{at the bottom of a}} pond, where he had drowned.|$|E
25|$|Always whole-hearted and {{sometimes}} inspired, he left Somerset after a richly deserved benefit season in 1994 {{to return to}} Northamptonshire. But {{the length of time}} between injuries became ever shorter, and the <b>body</b> <b>could</b> clearly take no more. He called it a day in 1996 with 937 first-class wickets, and nearly 5,000 runs.|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s most {{organs of}} the <b>body</b> <b>could</b> be visualized using nuclear {{medicine}} procedures. In 1971, American Medical Association officially recognized nuclear medicine {{as a medical}} specialty. In 1972, the American Board of Nuclear Medicine was established, and in 1974, the American Osteopathic Board of Nuclear Medicine was established, cementing nuclear medicine as a stand-alone medical specialty.|$|E
50|$|Medical {{services}} included {{first aid}} parties who provided {{on the spot}} medical assistance. More serious injuries were passed to first aid posts by stretcher parties and to local hospitals by ambulance personnel. If required, <b>bodies</b> <b>could</b> be removed to emergency mortuaries.|$|R
50|$|There is some {{discrepancy}} {{over the}} death toll depending upon the source, as this number is claimed to be 35, or 31. The discrepancy likely arose because four <b>bodies</b> <b>could</b> not be recovered. All of the fatalities were among the passengers.|$|R
25|$|The hull of {{the ship}} was {{gradually}} opened and the bodies of all but three of the 118 personnel on board were recovered. Those three were so badly destroyed by the blast and fire that their <b>bodies</b> <b>could</b> not be identified or recovered.|$|R
