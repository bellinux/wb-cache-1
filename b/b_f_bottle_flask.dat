We define formally what a structure is, and then show that the set F n of n-layers <b>B</b> <b>F</b> N structures can be expressed as the direct sum of the set A n of n-layers <b>B</b> <b>F</b> N architectures and the set D n of n-layers <b>B</b> <b>F</b> N dimensions.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we discuss the problem of {{approximating}} a belief function (<b>b.</b> <b>f.)</b> with a necessity measure or “consonant belief function” (co. <b>b.</b> <b>f.)</b> from a geometric point of view. We focus in particular on outer consonant approximations, i. e. co. <b>b.</b> <b>f.</b> s less committed than the original <b>b.</b> <b>f.</b> in terms of degrees of belief. We show that for each maximal chain of focal elements the set of outer consonant approximation is a polytope. We describe the vertices of such polytope, and characterize the geometry of maximal outer approximations. ...|$|R

25|$|The Near East has, since Roman times, been {{recognized}} as a center of quality glassware and crystal. 9th century finds from Samarra show styles similar to Sassanian forms. The types of objects made were <b>bottles,</b> <b>flasks,</b> vases, and cups utilized for domestic use. Decorations on these domestic items include molded flutes, honeycomb patters, and inscriptions. Other styles seen {{that may not have}} come from the Sassanians were stamped items. These were typically round stamps, such as medallions or disks with animals, birds, or Kufic inscriptions. Colored lead glass, typically blue or green, have been found in Nishapur, along with prismatic perfume bottles. Finally, cut glass may have been the high point of Abbasid glass-working, decorated with floral and animal designs.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new class}} of dynamic multi layer perceptrons, called Block Feedback Neural Networks (<b>B</b> <b>F</b> N). <b>B</b> <b>F</b> N have been developed to provide a systematic way to build networks of high complexity, including networks with coupled loops, nested loops and so on. <b>B</b> <b>F</b> Ns are specified using a block notation. Any <b>B</b> <b>F</b> N {{can be seen as a}} block and connected to other <b>B</b> <b>F</b> Ns using a fixed number of elementary connections. The result of such a connection can also be considered as a block, and connected to other blocks, in a recursive fashion. We develop a cost-minimizing supervised training algorithm for this model. The algorithm is a gradient-descent type, and is tailored on the block structure of the model. Finally, we present some experiments of use of <b>B</b> <b>F</b> Ns. 1 Introduction The interest in dynamic neural networks has been steadily growing in the past few years, and a number of models have been proposed [...] such as Williams and Zipser's Forward Propagation network (Williams and Z [...] ...|$|R
