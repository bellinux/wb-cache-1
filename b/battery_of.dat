5|$|Benchmark tests {{conducted}} by SlashGear {{concluded that the}} SoC of the fourth-generation iPad is able to perform CPU-reliant tasks {{more than twice as}} fast as that of the third-generation iPad. A series of benchmark tests conducted on the graphics performance of the fourth-generation iPad by Anandtech resulted in the device achieving the highest score compared to other consumer mobile devices, including the Samsung Galaxy S III, Nexus 10 and third-generation iPad. The performance increase of the fourth-generation iPad varies between tests, however an increase is nonetheless evident. Furthermore, battery longevity tests {{conducted by}} the same organization suggests that the <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> the fourth-generation iPad is able to last longer than its predecessor. However, the <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> the updated iPad 2 is able to outlast the fourth-generation iPad.|$|E
