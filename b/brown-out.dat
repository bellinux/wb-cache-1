CEL had also been constructing a new power station, Bulimba B, which opened the following year, and it together with the Tennyson station which opened in 1955 significantly eased the post-war power shortages that had seen frequent <b>brown-outs,</b> load shedding by industries and staggered work hours introduced to alleviate that situation.In the far north of the state, expansion of electricity generation capacity in the Cairns region was determined to be more economically achieved by hydro-electric schemes, as the cost of shipping coal to Cairns was significant. The Kareeya Hydro Power Station was commissioned in 1957, and the Barron Gorge power station was significantly expanded in 1963. At Mt Isa, the first stage of the Mica Creek Power Station was commissioned in 1960, coal being transported there as a 'back load' in wagons used to haul metal ingots from the smelter to Townsville that would otherwise be empty on the return journey. This continued until the station converted to burn gas in 2000.|$|R
40|$|The world {{summit on}} {{sustainable}} development in Johannesburg concluded that changing unsustainable patterns of energy {{use is a}} key area for global action to ensure survival of our planet. Demand response in the residential sector can {{play a key role}} in ensuring a secured and sustainable electricity supply by reducing future investments in generation and interconnection capacity and hence reducing the growth of electricity price and the development impacts on land and CO 2 emissions. Further, demand response capability would increase the resilience of the power supply system to shortages, thus improving the security of supply and energy services. Demand side management has been used successfully over several decades to manage base-load demand growth, and to shift loads from peak to off-peak times. Demand response to reduce consumption at peak times on the network has been largely aimed at large industrial and commercial users. Information barriers and the lack of understanding of residential consumer behavior in responding to price signals has impeded development of effective response strategies and new enabling technologies in the residential sector. In this paper, we discuss some of the key social and behavioral issues that are being explored in order to achieve effective demand response. The research objective of the present work is to explore the peak hours demand response elasticity to price, environmental impacts (CO 2 intensity of generation), and social factors (risk of <b>brown-outs</b> and black-outs). These three elasticities are being measured by surveys of different residential households using a survey designed for the purpose. The project aim is to use this information, plus modelling of household activities and energy services to develop concepts for innovative engineering solutions to demand response through targeted communication of information about the supply system...|$|R
