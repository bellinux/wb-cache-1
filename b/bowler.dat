5|$|A batting all-rounder, Loxton {{played as}} a {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast medium <b>bowler</b> who reinforced the frontline pace attack of Lindwall, Miller and Bill Johnston. When fit, the trio all bowled before Loxton in the Tests. With medium pacer Ernie Toshack and off spinner Ian Johnson also {{playing in the}} Third and Fourth Tests, Loxton was the sixth <b>bowler.</b> In the Fifth Test, Johnson was replaced by leg spinner Ring and the injured Toshack {{was replaced by a}} batsman, so Loxton became the fifth <b>bowler.</b> Of the seven regular bowlers, Loxton {{was the only one who}} was not a frontline <b>bowler,</b> and as such he had the worst average, the second-worst economy rate and the third-worst strike rate. Loxton ended the Test series with 144 runs at 48.00 and three wickets at 49.33, having bowled 63 overs. Loxton batted at No.6 or No.7 during the Tests, and was the last batsman in the batting order before the wicket-keeper and the bowlers.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the career history of {{low back pain}} (LBP) in current elite female cricket fast <b>bowlers</b> and then compare measures of lumbar spine and hip range of motion (ROM) and trunk extensor endurance between those <b>bowlers</b> with and without a history of LBP. Measures for the female <b>bowlers</b> were also compared to {{a small sample of}} male fast <b>bowlers.</b> Participants: Twenty-six elite female fast <b>bowlers</b> and eight male fast <b>bowlers</b> of similar age and bowling experience. Main outcome measures: The career history of LBP was determined by a self-administered questionnaire and by accessing medical records. Range of motion measures for the lumbar spine and hips were obtained using inclinometry or goniometry. Trunk extensor endurance was assessed using a modified Sorensen test. Results: Fourteen female fast <b>bowlers</b> had a history of LBP. There was a significant difference in lumbar lateral flexion ROM to the bowling arm side between those female fast <b>bowlers</b> with and without a history of LBP (p≤ 0. 05). The female fast <b>bowlers</b> had significantly more bilateral hip extension ROM (p≤ 0. 05) compared to the male fast <b>bowlers.</b> Conclusions: This information should be useful for practitioners involved in the conditioning and rehabilitation of cricketers. Future prospective studies should investigate potential predictors of LBP in female fast <b>bowlers...</b>|$|R

5|$|Muralitharan {{has taken}} ten or more wickets per match on more {{occasions}} {{than any other}} <b>bowler</b> in Test cricket. He has performed this feat 22 times, {{more than double the}} number of the <b>bowler</b> ranking second—Shane Warne, who has achieved this on 10 occasions.|$|E
5|$|A hat-trick in cricket {{is when a}} <b>bowler</b> {{takes three}} wickets from {{consecutive}} deliveries. It is a relatively rare feat, and has occurred eighteen times {{in the history of}} women's international cricket. The first hat-trick was taken in a Test match between Australia and England in February 1958, by Australia's Betty Wilson. The most recent <b>bowler</b> to achieve the feat was the New Zealand off spiner, Anna Peterson, against Australia during a Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) in February 2017.|$|E

2500|$|The West Indies {{generally}} play fast <b>bowlers</b> {{more so than}} spin <b>bowlers.</b> The West Indian team at any {{one time}} will generally consist of four fast <b>bowlers</b> (as opposed to a mixture of fast and spin <b>bowlers).</b> They have on occasion played spin <b>bowlers</b> however, they tend to be batting All-Rounders.

25|$|While a <b>bowler's</b> action {{does not}} affect their bowling speed, it can limit the style of balls that they can bowl. Although {{this is not a}} hard and fast rule, side-on <b>bowlers</b> {{generally}} bowl outswingers, and chest-on <b>bowlers</b> generally bowl inswingers.|$|R
5|$|A {{player has}} taken two hat-tricks {{in the same}} Test match only once. Playing for Australia against South Africa in the first match of the 1912 Triangular Tournament at Old Trafford, Manchester, England, leg spinner Jimmy Matthews took a hat-trick in South Africa's first and second innings, both taken on 28 May 1912. He {{completed}} both hat-tricks by dismissing South Africa's Tommy Ward. Only three other cricketers have taken more than one Test hat-trick: Australian off spinner Hugh Trumble (two years apart, between the same teams at the same ground), Pakistani fast <b>bowler</b> Wasim Akram (just over a week apart, in consecutive matches between the same teams) and English fast <b>bowler</b> Stuart Broad. Three players have taken a hat-trick on their Test debut: English medium pace <b>bowler</b> Maurice Allom in 1930, New Zealand off-spinner Peter Petherick in 1976, and Australian pace <b>bowler</b> Damien Fleming in 1994. Geoff Griffin took the fewest total Test wickets of any player who recorded a hat-trick, taking only eight wickets in his entire Test career. During the match in which he took his hat-trick, Griffin was repeatedly called for throwing by the umpires and never bowled again in a Test match. Australian Peter Siddle is the only <b>bowler</b> to take a hat-trick on his birthday, and Bangladeshi off spinner Sohag Gazi is the only player to score a century and take a hat-trick in the same Test match.|$|E
5|$|Although {{his poor}} batting meant his form as an all-rounder was disappointing, {{he had a}} very good season as a <b>bowler.</b> Nevertheless, his {{selection}} to tour Australia that winter with the MCC team surprised commentators.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the <b>bowler.</b> A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the <b>bowler,</b> putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
25|$|In most cricketing countries, fast <b>bowlers</b> are {{considered}} to be the mainstay of a team's bowling attack, with slower <b>bowlers</b> in support roles. On the Indian subcontinent, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, the reverse is often true, with fast <b>bowlers</b> serving mainly to soften the ball up for the spinners. This is largely due to the condition of the pitches used in those countries which gives more help to spinners than to fast <b>bowlers,</b> but at international level it is also a reflection of the outstanding skills of their spinners compared to their pace <b>bowlers.</b> Pakistan, however, is an exception in the subcontinent with a rich history of producing high quality fast <b>bowlers.</b>|$|R

5|$|Davidson {{originally}} bowled {{left arm}} unorthodox spin, {{but when his}} uncle's team was missing a fast <b>bowler</b> in a country match, Davidson stepped in, remaining a fast <b>bowler</b> permanently. In 1948–49, he moved to Sydney and joined the Northern Districts grade club. A talented rugby league player in his youth, he trained with the Western Districts Football Club in the off season to maintain his fitness.|$|E
5|$|He {{also played}} cricket at University, {{initially}} {{for the second}} team, and he {{was considered to be}} as good a cricketer as he was at rugby. He was a slow-pace <b>bowler,</b> and at one time, he was the most successful <b>bowler</b> at the University. He played in two matches against Melbourne University: in 1903, he took two wickets for 22 runs in the first innings, and six wickets for 20 in the second; in 1904, he took four for 70 and three for 69.|$|E

5|$|In the Manchester Test of 1956, England spin <b>bowler</b> Jim Laker took 19 wickets for 90 runs (19–90) {{which set}} {{not only the}} Test record for best match figures but also the {{first-class}} one. In taking 10–53 in the second innings {{he became the first}} <b>bowler</b> to capture all ten wickets in a Test match innings, and his analysis remains the best innings figures. Indian Leg-spinner Anil Kumble is the only other <b>bowler</b> to have taken 10 wickets in an innings, claiming 10–74 against Pakistan in 1999. West Indies batsman Brian Lara has the highest individual score in Test cricket: he scored 400 not out against England in 2004 to surpass the innings of 380 by Matthew Hayden six months earlier. Lara had held the record before Hayden, with a score of 375 against England 10 years earlier. Pakistan's Misbah-ul-Haq holds the record of the fastest test half century scoring 50 runs from 21 balls. The record for the fastest test century is held by New Zealand's Brendon McCullum who scored 100 runs from 54 balls in his final test match.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{retrospectively}} calculated by the International Cricket Council's LG Ratings {{that he was}} the best <b>bowler</b> in the world for much of his career.|$|E
5|$|Johnston was a left-arm <b>bowler</b> {{who engaged}} in fast bowling when the ball was new and conducive to pacemen, before {{reverting}} to orthodox spin when the ball became old. He was Australia's third fast <b>bowler</b> in the Tests, reinforcing the new ball attack of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall, who were {{regarded as one of}} the finest pace pairings of all time. Bradman typically used Miller and Lindwall in short bursts against the English batsmen with the new ball. The hosts had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, more frequently than usual. This allowed the Australian pacemen more frequent use of a shiny ball that swung at high pace. Johnston typically delivered pace after the Lindwall and Miller had first use of the new ball, before resorting to spin later in the innings. In order to keep Lindwall and Miller fresh, Bradman had Johnston deliver the most overs by any <b>bowler.</b>|$|E

50|$|However, as {{a general}} rule the {{different}} types of <b>bowlers</b> use similar approaches to each other. For example, Spin <b>bowlers</b> tend to have very short run-ups, some even approach the bowling crease at a walking pace. Medium <b>bowlers</b> tend to run up off a short run-up of about 10 paces or so. Fast <b>bowlers</b> tend to have long, rhythmical run-ups to allow them to develop momentum which adds to their ability to bowl the ball at high speeds.|$|R

5|$|Lindwall {{was only}} in the Third XI of St. George at the time, but by December, he was in the First XI along with future Invincibles {{teammate}} Arthur Morris. The senior team was captained by Bill O'Reilly, a leg spin <b>bowler</b> who represented Australia in Tests and was regarded as the best <b>bowler</b> in the world. O'Reilly was a firm man and came to be a father figure for Lindwall. Lindwall came into the team seeing himself as an into-the-wind swing <b>bowler.</b> O'Reilly felt that pace bowlers were only useful for a few overs with new ball, so he instructed Lindwall to lengthen his run-up and bowl as fast as possible. O’Reilly also decided that the team needed more bowlers. He placed Lindwall low in the batting order, where he often did not get an opportunity to bat. Lindwall did not bother protesting, realising that dissent against the autocratic O’Reilly would be futile. O'Reilly also reversed Morris from a <b>bowler</b> into a batsman. Both Morris and Lindwall became world-leading players in the fields that O’Reilly chose for them. By the end of the 1938–39 season, Lindwall had not yet established himself as a cricketer. Former Test batsman Charlie Macartney lamented what he perceived as a lack of talent and substance at St. George. Lindwall returned to school, attempting to obtain his Leaving Certificate while also playing third-grade rugby. In July, Lindwall's father died, leaving him and his four siblings orphaned.|$|E
