40|$|Cdh 1 is a {{coactivator}} of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) {{and contributes}} to mitotic exit and G 1 maintenance by facilitating the polyubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis of specific substrates. Here, we report that budding yeast Cdh 1 is a component of a cell cycle-regulated complex that includes the 14 - 3 - 3 homologs Bmh 1 and Bmh 2 and a previously uncharacterized protein, which we name Acm 1 (APC/CCdh 1 modulator 1). Association of Cdh 1 with Bmh 1 and Bmh 2 requires Acm 1, and the Acm 1 protein is cell cycle regulated, appearing late in G 1 and disappearing in late M. In acm 1 Δ strains, Cdh 1 localization to the bud neck and association with two substrates, Clb 2 and Hsl 1, were strongly enhanced. Several lines of evidence suggest that Acm 1 can suppress APC/CCdh 1 -mediated proteolysis of mitotic cyclins. First, overexpression of Acm 1 fully restored viability to cells expressing toxic levels of Cdh 1 or a constitutively active Cdh 1 mutant lacking inhibitory phosphorylation sites. Second, overexpression of Acm 1 was toxic in sic 1 Δ cells. Third, ACM 1 deletion exacerbated a low-penetrance elongated-bud phenotype caused by modest overexpression of Cdh 1. This <b>bud</b> <b>elongation</b> was independent of the morphogenesis checkpoint, and the combination of acm 1 Δ and hsl 1 Δ resulted in a dramatic enhancement of <b>bud</b> <b>elongation</b> and G 2 /M delay. Effects on <b>bud</b> <b>elongation</b> were attenuated when Cdh 1 was replaced with a mutant lacking the C-terminal IR dipeptide, suggesting that APC/C-dependent proteolysis is required for this phenotype.

30|$|Although {{the huge}} numbers of shoot buds were induced, the {{elongation}} of these newly induced buds was a real problem and few of them had elongated {{at a time in}} presence of cytokinin only.

30|$|The {{stage of}} callus {{differentiation}} {{is a key}} to establishing a regeneration system. Organ differentiation was mainly determined by the balance of hormones, which is changed by adjusting appropriate exogenous cytokinin and auxin levels (Shirin and Rana 2007). A high concentration of BA might cause plant growth inhibition or have toxic effects on bamboo growth. A low concentration of KT played an active role in differentiation, whereas a high concentration could cause bud browning and unhealthy plants (Nadgir et al. 1984; Chambers et al. 1991).

40|$|AbstractDuring chick liver development, {{the liver}} bud {{arises from the}} foregut, invaginates into the septum transversum, and elongates along and envelops the ductus venosus. However, the {{mechanism}} of liver bud migration is only poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that a GDNF family ligand involved in neuronal outgrowth and migration, neurturin (NRTN), and its receptor, GFRα 2, are essential for liver bud migration. In the chick embryo, we found that GFRα 2 was expressed in the liver bud and that NRTN was expressed in the endothelial cells of the ductus venosus. Inhibition of GFRα 2 signaling suppressed liver <b>bud</b> <b>elongation</b> along the ductus venous without affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis. Moreover, ectopic expression of NRTN perturbed the directional migration along the ductus venosus, leading to splitting or ectopic branching of the liver. We showed that liver buds selectively migrated toward an NRTN-soaked bead in vitro. These data represent a new model for liver bud migration: NRTN secreted from endothelial cells functions as a chemoattractant to direct the migration of the GFRα 2 -expressing liver bud in early liver development...|$|E

40|$|Apical {{dominance}} {{appears to}} have minimal direct involvement in daughter bulb formation in the bulbous Iris cultivar Ideal. Daughter bulb number and growth relate to the size and reproductive state of the mother bulb and are not markedly influenced by meristem destruction. In contrast, destruction or removal of the apical meristem promotes lateral bud sprouting in intact bulbs, and lateral <b>bud</b> <b>elongation</b> in Iris meristem explants. These results show that, in contrast to certain other bulbous plants, apical dominance does not direcdy limit daughter bulb number in bulbous Iris, but does prevent lateral bud sprouting. Key words: Apical dominance — Bulbous Iris — Daughter bulbs — Shoot growth. Commercial flower bulb propagation sometimes involves artificial removal of apical dominance. For example, with hyacinth, daughter bulb formation is pro-moted by wounding of the basal plate and bulb meristem (i. e. "scouring " or "cross cutting " 17), and a specific heat treatment, "blindstoken, " is said to cause increased daughter bulb yields in tulip by killing the reproductive apex and releasing the lateral buds from correlative inhibition (16, 17, 20, 21) ...|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} cell interactions during induction of skin appendages, {{we studied}} {{the roles of}} adhesion molecules N-CAM, tenascin, integrin, and fibronectin during feather development. Tenascin appeared in a periodic pattern on epithelia and was so far the earliest molecule detected in placodes. Three placode domains were identified: the anterior was positive for tenascin, the distal positive for N-CAM, and the posterior lacking both. Integrin appeared in dermalepidermal junctions of placodes. In feather buds, sagittal sections revealed a transient anterior-posterior asymmetry with tenascin and N-CAM enriched in the anterior mesoderm. Tangential sections revealed a lateral-medial asymmetry with tenascin distributed in a ring shape and N-CAM in an “X ” shape. Integrin was diffusely distributed within buds. Later tenascin and N-CAM were enriched in dermal papilla, the inducer of skin appendages. Perturbation of embryonic skin explant cultures with antibodies showed that anti-integrin fi 1 and anti-fibronectin blocked epithelial-mesenchyma 1 interaction, anti-N-CAM caused uneven segregation of mesenchymal condensation, and anti-tenascin inhibited feather <b>bud</b> <b>elongation.</b> Dose-response curves showed gradual effects by these antibodies.

The only reported additional source of variation in anther height derives from differences in growth of filaments, where anthers are attached to the corolla. Faivre ([2000]) observed slightly longer filaments in the short-styled (thrum) forms of P. chiapenis and P. poeppigiana, but specifically not in B. ternifolia. Thus both growth patterns for anthers are found within the family Rubiaceae, although in H. caerulea, filament length did not affect anther height. Riveros et al.

IAA, in combination with kinetin, also inhibits kinetin-induced bud prophyll (outermost leaf of the axillary <b>bud)</b> <b>elongation.</b> The IAA oxidase cofactor p-coumaric acid stimulates lateral bud release; the auxin transport inhibitor 2, 3, 5 -triiodo-benzoic acid and the antiauxin α (p-chlorophenoxy) -isobutyric acid inhibit IAA-induced adventitious root formation. Gibberellic acid is synergistic with kinetin in the elongation of the bud prophyll. In intact oat plants, tiller release is induced by shoot decapitation, geostimulation, or the emergence of the inflorescence.

The ratio of buds becoming floral was independent of watering treatment, and the enhanced rate of floral bud production in the previously-stressed treatments was due to higher rates of total bud differentiation which persisted {{for up to six}} weeks after rewatering. Survival of floral buds was reduced by previous stress, but number of flowers per inflorescence, pod setting, seed number per pod and 100 -seed weight were independent of treatment. Seed production was controlled by inflorescence density. Rate of seed production was independent of treatment during water deficit and four weeks subsequently, and was then enhanced by 46 and 54 per cent relative to the control in the - 0. 7 and - 1. 0 MPa treatments respectively...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The ephrin {{receptor}} (Eph) tyrosine kinases {{and their}} ephrin ligands {{are involved in}} morphogenesis during organ formation. We studied their role in feather morphogenesis, focusing on ephrin-B 1 and its receptor EphB 3. Early in feather development, ephrin-B 1 mRNA and protein {{were found to be}} expressed in the dermal condensation, but not in the inter-bud mesenchyme. Later, in feather buds, expression was found in both the epithelium and mesenchyme. In the feather follicle, ephrin-B 1 protein expression was found to be enriched in the feather filament epithelium and in the marginal plate which sets the boundary between the barb ridges. EphB 3 mRNA was also expressed in epithelia. In the feather bud, its expression was restricted to the posterior bud. In the follicle, its expression formed a circle at the bud base which may set the boundary between bud and inter-bud domains. Perturbation with ephrin-B 1 /Fc altered feather primordia segregation and feather <b>bud</b> <b>elongation.</b> Analyses revealed that ephrin-B 1 /Fc caused three types of changes: blurred placode boundaries with loose dermal condensations, incomplete follicle invagination with less compact dermal papillae, and aberrant barb ridge patterning in feather filament morphogenesis. Thus, while ephrin-B 1 suppression does not inhibit the initial emergence of a new epithelial domain, Eph/ephrin-B 1 interaction is required for its proper completion. Consequently, we propose that interaction between ephrin-B 1 and its receptor is involved in boundary stabilization during feather morphogenesis.

40|$|In many organisms, polo kinases {{appear to}} play {{multiple}} roles during M-phase progression. To provide {{new insights into}} the function of budding yeast polo kinase Cdc 5 p, we generated novel temperature-sensitive cdc 5 mutants by mutagenizing the C-terminal domain. Here we show that, at a semipermissive temperature, the cdc 5 - 3 mutant exhibited a synergistic <b>bud</b> <b>elongation</b> and growth defect with loss of HSL 1, a component important for normal G(2) /M transition. Loss of SWE 1, which phosphorylates and inactivates the budding yeast Cdk 1 homolog Cdc 28 p, suppressed the cdc 5 - 3 hsl 1 Delta defect, suggesting that Cdc 5 p functions at a point upstream of Swe 1 p. In addition, the cdc 5 - 4 and cdc 5 - 7 mutants exhibited chained cell morphologies with shared cytoplasms between the connected cell bodies, indicating a cytokinetic defect. Close examination of these mutants revealed delayed septin assembly at the incipient bud site and loosely organized septin rings at the mother-bud neck. Components in the mitotic exit network (MEN) play important roles in normal cytokinesis. However, loss of BFA 1 or BUB 2, negative regulators of the MEN, failed to remedy the cytokinetic defect of these mutants, indicating that Cdc 5 p promotes cytokinesis independently of Bfa 1 p and Bub 2 p. Thus, Cdc 5 p contributes to the activation of the Swe 1 p-dependent Cdc 28 p/Clb pathway, normal septin function, and cytokinesis...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the late}} 1990 's, crown dieback of young (approximately 5 to 10 years old) birch (Betula pendula and B. pubescens) has been causing concern at over 20 planted sites in Scotland. Preliminary {{studies showed that}} the endemic fungus Anisogramma virgultorum is {{pathogenic}} on birch and a suspected causal agent ofcrown dieback at affected sites. A survey conducted at nine Scottish Woodland Grant Scheme sites in 2004 and 2006 showed that disease incidence and severity was greater on B. pubescens than B. pendula (n= 900) over all sites and over both survey years. Crown dieback was significantly greater on infected than uninfected B. pubescens. Anisogramma virgultorum was also present on trees surveyed at two (Dunkeld and Domoch) ofthe six birch provenanc(trials located in Scotland with 17. 3 % (n= 2, 741) and 3. 7 % (n= 830) disease incidence, respectively. At the Dunkeld trial site, the presence of A. virgultorum contributed significantly to crown dieback. During a survey of 90 site-natural birch stands across Scotland (n= 8, 492) A. virgultorum was only present at 13 sites. Incidence ofdisease at each site was generally low (::; 5 %) except for three sites where 12, 21 and 52 % incidence of A. virgultorum were recorded. An ascospore release experiment conducted over a 94 -week period showed a strong periodicity with main spore release events occurring in spring (from April to June) of 2006 and 2007. This coincided with flushing of the vegetative <b>buds</b> and <b>elongation</b> of young birch shoots. Natural infection and artificial inoculation experiments showed that young birch seedlings are susceptible to infection with Ã‚Â·A. virgultorum from flushing of the vegetative <b>buds</b> through shoot <b>elongation.</b> In a histopathological study of A. virgultorum cankers different stages of canker development on birch shoots are described. Fully developed cankers with living perithecia were observed four to five months from initial infection. In a shoot dieback study, four branch systems of B. pubescens trees and four intact birch seedlings were monitored regularly over a two-year period. The majority of shoots with A. virgultorum cankers died back within {{one or two years}} after initial infection. A phylogenetic analysis of LSD sequences of A. virgultorum and the closely related A. anomala was conducted with 57 representative taxa of the order Diaporthales. The two fungi formed a well-supported monophyletic clade outside the Gnomoniaceae sensu strictu and were unrelated to the remaining eight families outlined in the Diaporthales.

40|$|Page(s) : 12 (2), 293 - 308, 25 Ref. A {{rapid and}} {{improved}} procedure of micropropagation of jasmine (Jasminum azoricum L.) was studied. Different types of tissue explants were cultured on MS salt mix containing different concentrations of {{naphthalene acetic acid}} (NAA), benzyl- aminopurine (BAP) and kinetin. The explants culture was conducted at different times {{in order to assess}} time effects on <b>bud</b> proliferation, <b>elongation</b> and root formation and to obtain proper clones after acclimatization. The results showed that kinetin (0. 5 mg/L) on the MS medium gave the best result with regard to bud proliferation and multiplication. However, addition of NAA of different concentrations was inhibitory. The response of base and intermediate cuttings was better than terminal ones. The best time for bud proliferation in primary explants culture on MS medium supplemented with 0. 5 mg/L kinetin was February and for bud multiplication February and March. Using 1. 5 mg/L IBA in in vitro rooting medium, gave 97 % rooted plantlets, while ex vitro rooting of plantlets on agricultural media after soaking their bases in a solution containing 20 mg/L IBA increased rooting percentage up to 99 %. In addition, the ex vitro rooting resulted in successful hardening of 94 % of the plantlets and reduced time, costs and efforts required for rooting and hardening. Khartoum University Pres...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{influence}} of four agar-type polysaccharides on the <b>budding</b> and the <b>elongation</b> of five clones of Thuja plicata was tested. The polysac-charides {{were used as}} solidifying agents for culture media and differed in their sulfate content (0. 14 to 10. 95 % W/W). Budding was reduced on the most highly sulfated polysaccharide, and the differences observed between clones in elonga-tion were as important as those observed between agar types. In order to understand factors determining the gel "quality " of agar, we have investigated the chemical composition, mechanical properties and thermal sta-bility of the gel samples. The results of this investigation show that the main factors that control the mechanical properties of gels are: the sulfate content, added nutrient medium, and autoclaving. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on May 8, 2016 jbc. sagepub. comDownloaded from 33...|$|R
