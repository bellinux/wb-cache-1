5|$|After the Test series ended, Miller captained a Commonwealth XI {{that played}} against a touring England team in Colombo, Ceylon. England had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{tour of the}} Indian subcontinent. Miller scored 106 as the Commonwealth {{compiled}} 517. Miller took three wickets in the first innings and led his team to a victory by an innings and 259runs.|$|E
5|$|As it {{had been}} two decades since much silver was {{regularly}} deposited for striking into coins, {{the fact that the}} United States had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bimetallic standard since 1792 was often forgotten. The gold standard was seen as the only possible choice, and many people assumed that the United States was on that standard, which had been adopted by strong nations like the United Kingdom (1816) and the German Empire (1871).|$|E
5|$|Early in this film, Denham {{shoots a}} scene for his film in which Ann, in-character, proclaims she's never <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> ship before, and Bruce Baxter improvises lines proclaiming annoyance. The {{dialogue}} they exchange is taken verbatim from early scenes between Ann and Jack Driscoll in the 1933 film. Ironically, in this film, Jack Driscoll expresses disapproval of such words toward Ann.|$|E

5|$|In the 2011–12 season, Barcelona {{lost the}} semi-finals of the Champions League against Chelsea. Right afterward, coach Guardiola, who had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rolling {{contract}} and had faced criticism over his recent tactics and squad selections, {{announced that he}} would step down as manager on 30 June and be succeeded by assistant Tito Vilanova. Guardiola finished his tenure with Barça winning the Copa del Rey final 3–0, bringing the tally to 14 trophies that Barça had won under his coaching.|$|E

He was entrusted with supervising the task, sewing bits of oakum and wool into an old sail, which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into {{the hole in the}} hull. The effort succeeded and soon very little water was entering, allowing the crew to stop two of the three pumps.|$|E

5|$|A year later, in September 1911, Italy {{declared}} war on the Ottoman Empire. The two battleships and the ancient central battery ironclad —which had {{been built in the}} mid-1870s—had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> summer training cruise since July, and so were prepared for the conflict. On 1 October, shortly after the outbreak of war, Barbaros Hayreddin {{and the rest of the}} Ottoman fleet was moored at Beirut. The following day, the fleet departed for Constantinople for repairs in preparation to engage the Italian fleet. Nevertheless, the bulk of the Ottoman fleet, including Barbaros Hayreddin, remained in port for the duration of the war. By the end of the war, Barbaros Hayreddin and her sister were in very poor condition. Their rangefinders and the ammunition hoists for their main battery guns had been removed, their telephones did not work, and the pipes for their pumps were badly rusted. Most of the watertight doors could not close, and the condensers remained problematic.|$|E
5|$|Before he {{left for}} Cranfield Braham was {{involved}} in another car accident which removed him from duty. He was injured when the Austin 7 {{in which he was}} travelling left the road at speed. He had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> night out celebrating his success. The five passengers (three officers and two girls) were all wounded, but one of the women later died in hospital. Once recovered Bob survived two scares on duty at Cranfield. On 13 March a Beaufighter's engines cut out forcing him to make an emergency landing, and on the same day, his second flight ended with the aircraft's engines catching fire. Braham managed to conduct a safe landing.|$|E

One of the old buildings still remains, visibly lower than the new trackbed.|$|R
5|$|Catastrophic {{injuries}} have <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{steady decline}} since the 1960s, {{due in part}} to rules banning dangerous forms of contact such as spearing, face tackling and butt blocking. However, catastrophic injuries are still caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, as well when players hit their heads against an opposing player's knee or the ground. Returning to play after sustaining a head injury earlier in the game also places players at risk for an even more severe injury. Many states are requiring teams to prevent players who have shown any signs of a concussion from returning to a game, while other steps such as more aggressive enforcement of safety rules and better condition of the neck muscles have been suggested. Additionally, coaches are being urged to train players to block with their shoulders instead of their heads.|$|E
5|$|First {{inhabited}} by native people, Cooper was founded around 1870, {{at the same}} time that Delta County was established. Cooper grew rapidly and it quickly became the center of local events. The city's economy relied primarily on agricultural farming and the shipping of local goods. In the mid-1890s, a railroad line was built through the city, assisting in Cooper's growth. The city continued to grow through the 1910s, and into the early 1920s. In 1926, however, the region's cotton crop failed, devastating the local economy. Many businesses were forced to close, including the railroad, and the city's population plummeted. Although Cooper began to recover during the mid-1930s, many people who left did not return, and the city never fully recovered. The local economy continued to rely on the growing of cotton as the main economy into the 1960s, until it began to shift to wheat growing in the early 1970s. The population of Cooper has <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> slow decline since the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Fowler {{began the}} 2001–02 season controversially, after being {{dropped by the}} then manager Gérard Houllier from the Liverpool squad for the 2001 Charity Shield match {{following}} a training ground confrontation with assistant manager Phil Thompson. He made an appearance in Liverpool's 3–2 European Super Cup victory over Bayern Munich, but starts were intermittent. In October 2001, he scored his first league hat-trick for three years, helping Liverpool beat Leicester City 4–1, but was dropped for the following league match. Though Fowler had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> contract extension from 1999 (unlike Steve McManaman – who exercised his Bosman entitlement the very same year), Fowler was linked to Lazio, Arsenal and Leeds, and Liverpool's management as well as fans and the media constantly reported that what happened with McManaman (regarded as a huge financial loss) would never be repeated and thus the club never rejected those bids without consideration. This meant that coupled with Fowler's relationship with Houllier, speculation over Fowler's future persisted for most of Houllier's tenure and became an issue that divided Liverpool fans. His last appearance for Liverpool was against Sunderland, {{in which he was}} substituted at half-time.|$|E
40|$|Avian erythroblastosis {{virus has}} transduced two {{cellular}} genes, c-erb-A and c-erb-B. Using fractionated chicken chromosomes, {{we found that}} the two genes <b>are</b> located <b>on</b> different chromosomes in the chicken genome: c-erb-A <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> microchromosome, and c-erb-B <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> large chromosome. The locations of two other cellular oncogenes (c-fps and c-myb) were also determined: c-fps <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> microchromosome, and c-myb <b>is</b> <b>on</b> chromosome of <b>an</b> intermediate size. Our results suggest that avian erythroblastosis virus had transduced the two cellular genes independently, conforming to previous indications that cellular oncogenes are dispersed among multiple chromosomes in every species that has been examined...|$|R

5|$|From {{the early}} 1990s to the mid-2000s, Winnipeg had a {{significant}} auto-theft problem, with the rate peaking at 2,165.0 per 100,000 residents in 2006 compared to 487 auto-thefts per 100,000 residents for Canada as a whole. To combat auto theft, Manitoba Public Insurance established financial incentives for motor vehicle owners to install ignition immobilizers in their vehicles, and now requires owners of high-risk vehicles to install immobilizers. The auto-theft rate has <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> constant drop since 2006. Other types of property crime have also decreased, but rates are still fairly high.|$|E
5|$|Howard Browne, who had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{leave of}} absence from Ziff-Davis to write fiction, took over as editor and began by {{throwing}} away 300,000 words of inventory that Palmer had acquired before he left. Browne had ambitions of moving Amazing upmarket, and his argument was strengthened by Street & Smith, one of the longest established and most respected publishers, who shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, {{largely as a result of}} the success of pocketbooks, and Street & Smith decided to concentrate on their slick magazines. Some pulps struggled on for a few more years, but Browne was able to persuade Ziff and Davis that the future was in the slicks, and they raised his fiction budget from one cent to a ceiling of five cents per word. Browne managed to get promises of new stories from many well-known authors, including Isaac Asimov and Theodore Sturgeon. He produced a dummy issue in April 1950, and planned to launch the new incarnation of Amazing in April 1951, the 25th anniversary of the first issue. However, the economic impact of the Korean War, which broke out in June 1950, led to budget cuts. The plans were cancelled, and Ziff-Davis never revived the idea.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1912 Lasker {{entered into}} {{negotiations}} {{for a world}} title match with Akiba Rubinstein, whose tournament record for the previous few years had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> par with Lasker's and {{a little ahead of}} Capablanca's. The two players agreed to play a match if Rubinstein could raise the funds, but Rubinstein had few rich friends to back him and the match was never played. This situation demonstrated some of the flaws inherent in the championship system then being used. The start of World War I in summer 1914 put an end to hopes that Lasker would play either Rubinstein or Capablanca for the World Championship in the near future.|$|E

5|$|Midfielder Michael Collins joined on a one-month {{loan from}} Oxford, as {{cover for the}} injured Nolan and Summerfield. Michael Coulson scored with a low shot to give York a 50th-minute lead at home to Cambridge United, and John McCombe scored four minutes later with a curling shot to make the score 2–0. However, Mark Roberts and Barry Corr scored for Cambridge in the last 19 minutes, and the match {{finished}} a 2–2 draw. York knocked League One team Doncaster Rovers out of the Football League Trophy {{in the second round}} with a 2–0 home win. Oliver gave York an early lead with a header into the bottom corner from an Anthony Straker cross, and he doubled the lead early into the second half; after dispossessing Aaron Taylor-Sinclair he lifted the ball over the advancing goalkeeper, Thorsten Stuckmann, before hitting the ball into an empty net. York ended Luton Town's four-match winning streak with a 1–1 away draw; Lowe scored late into the first half with a shot into the top of the goal, before Luton equalised in the second half from a Cameron McGeehan penalty. Turner's loan was extended for a second month. York were beaten 3–1 away by Barnet, who had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> three-match losing streak. After going behind to John Akinde's goal, Coulson equalised for York in the 80th minute with a drilled shot, but goals in the last 10 minutes from Michael Gash and Josh Clarke secured a win for the home team.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{then joined}} Celtic in 1997 {{as a youth}} player, and made his {{professional}} league debut against Dundee United on 21 May 2000.

During his time at Celtic Park, he had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> six-month loan spell with Danish football club AGF Aarhus during the 2001–02 season, making 18 appearances without scoring a goal. They considered signing him permanently for £300,000.|$|E
