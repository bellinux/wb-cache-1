40|$|This paper studies {{a unique}} network feature, Ethernet bridge, in the Linux kernel and conducts an {{extensive}} experiment to measure its performance {{as defined in}} RFC- 2544. The result shows that Linux bridge yields satisfactory performance if the system occupancy is less than 56 % where its latency and throughput are comparable to Cisco Catalyst 2950 switch. The performance is considered acceptable until system occupancy reaches 85 %. We also compared the performance between Linux bridge and Linux router, {{and the results are}} almost the same as measured by latency and throughput. The contributions of this study are summarized as follows: 1. With its open source, Linux bridge is like programmable switch for education and research. We are encouraged by the performance results of this study, and plan for more advanced research on Linux bridge in load balancing and high availability. 2. The performance result shows that Linux can be deployed as an effective network device if its occupancy is properly engineered for targeted applications. One example is network firewall where the Wide Area Network (WAN) link is usually than 10 M. 3. Our experiment of <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>router</b> configuration can be used for classroom demo and lab exercise on data network education. The use of RFC- 2544 serves as a useful guide to learn network benchmark testing and performance measurements. 3 / 29 / 2004 2 1...|$|E

Emulation of <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> <b>routers</b> that link networks together may provide valuable information regarding network congestion, network storms and the like before putting expensive hardware into place. Such an emulation also enables students taking a networking course to develop their own client-server applications and to visualize the basic functioning of the UDP/IP and RIP protocols. This thesis builds on the emulated local area network, Metanet, created by a previous graduate student. It adds the capability of attaching <b>routers</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridges</b> to multiple local and non-local emulated networks so that data may be transferred between two hosts on different segments of the same LAN (via an emulated bridge) or two different networks altogether (via an emulated router).

40|$|In {{the current}} {{recommendations}} on Internetworking over Non Broadcasting Medium Access and Multi-Protocol Over ATM, {{the issues of}} ATM bandwidth allocation and flow control for best effort external LAN flows, forwarded to ATM connections, have not been adequately addressed. In this paper, we integrate the above features in the Access Units (i. e., <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> <b>routers)</b> to smooth the bursty aggregate LAN traffic, to minimize losses due to congestion and consequently to achieve high end-to-end performance. The proposed flow control mechanism {{is based on the}} knowledge of the bandwidth available in the backbone network. Bandwidth advertising and explicit congestion notification mechanisms are provided by several network technologies such as Frame Relay and ATM. In the latter case the corresponding transfer capability is the Available Bit Rate (ABR). The proposed flow control mechanism, counts the frame delay in the Access Unit, and sends explicit feedback (backpressure) to neighboring legacy LAN sources. Explicit feedback partially absorbs the self-similar features of the LAN traffic and can extend the ABR flow control to the non-ATM legacy LAN stations. The shaping performed by the AU can be considered independent to the specific bandwidth advertising mechanism of the backbone network; in our case the ABR. In the performance results, the mechanism is shown to be efficient and adaptive to changes in the ATM available bandwidth and to a variety of LAN traffic characteristics. It is also shown that the flow control mechanism can be easily integrated in the protocol stacks currently met by today's LANs...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} high speed {{communication}} networks created {{new opportunities for}} real-time applications. The support of these applications require the development of adequate communication protocols. Several {{issues related to the}} transport of multimedia communications are currently being reassessed. Among these issues, the problem of congestion and flow control in packet switched networks is seeing renewed interest. The task of flow and congestion control is to regulate the amount of data admitted to the network {{in such a way that}} resources such as logical channels, buffers, transmission bandwidth, and processor time are efficiently utilized and user performance requirements are met. Congestion in an internet environment, consisting of numerous local and wide area networks connected by <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> <b>routers,</b> is particularly challenging. The current trend at the network design level specify a new channel abstraction to efficiently support guaranteed levels of performance for a variety of applications. In such an environment congestion control may seem to be easier to exercise. However, the characteristics of the real time applications vary dramatically, and are anticipated to stress correspondingly different designs issues on congestion control protocols. Furthermore, the presence of the "best effort" traffic will still require some form of network control. Consequently, solution falling outside the traditional datagram and virtual circuit paradigms must be provided. We propose a hybrid, adaptive congestion control mechanism based on a feedback control to regulate traffic with different requirements. Based on the requirements specified by the application, the scheme allows the network to selectively throttle the channels with the less stringent real-time requirements in order to alleviate congestion...|$|R
