25|$|Boric acid in {{equilibrium}} {{with its}} conjugate base the borate ion {{is widely used}} (in the concentration range 50 - 100ppm boron equivalents) as a primary or adjunct pH buffer system in swimming pools. Boric acid is a weak acid, with pKa (the pH at which buffering is strongest because the free acid and borate ion are in equal concentrations) of 9.24 in pure water at 25°C. But apparent pKa is substantially lower in swimming pool or ocean waters because of interactions with various other molecules in solution. It will be around 9.0 in a salt-water pool. No matter which form of soluble boron is added, within the acceptable range of pH and <b>boron</b> <b>concentration</b> for swimming pools, boric acid is the predominant form in aqueous solution, {{as shown in the}} accompanying figure. The boric acid - borate system can be useful as a primary buffer system (substituting for the bicarbonate system with pKa1 = 6.0 and pKa2 = 9.4 under typical salt-water pool conditions) in pools with salt-water chlorine generators that tend to show upward drift in pH from a working range of pH 7.5 - 8.2. Buffer capacity is greater against rising pH (towards the pKa around 9.0), as illustrated in the accompanying graph. The use of boric acid in this concentration range does not allow any reduction in free HOCl concentration needed for pool sanitation, but it may add marginally to the photo-protective effects of cyanuric acid and confer other benefits through anti-corrosive activity or perceived water softness, depending on overall pool solute composition.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundBoron is a {{metalloid}} {{found at}} highly varying concentrations in soil and water. Experimental {{data indicate that}} boron is a developmental toxicant, but the few human toxicity data available concern mostly male reproduction. ObjectivesTo evaluate potential effects of boron exposure through drinking water on pregnancy outcomes. MethodsIn a mother-child cohort in northern Argentina (n= 194), 1 – 3 samples of serum, whole blood and urine were collected per woman during pregnancy and analyzed for boron and other elements to which exposure occurred, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Infant weight, length and head circumference were measured at birth. ResultsDrinking water boron ranged 377 – 10, 929 μg/L. The serum <b>boron</b> <b>concentrations</b> during pregnancy ranged 0. 73 – 605 μg/L (median 133 μg/L) and correlated strongly with whole-blood and urinary boron, and, to a lesser extent, with water boron. In multivariable-adjusted linear spline regression analysis (non-linear association), we found that serum <b>boron</b> <b>concentrations</b> above 80 μg/L were inversely associated with birth length (B− 0. 69 cm, 95 % CI − 1. 4; − 0. 024, p= 0. 043, per 100 μg/L increase in serum boron). The impact of boron appeared stronger when we restricted the exposure to the third trimester, when the serum <b>boron</b> <b>concentrations</b> were the highest (0. 73 – 447 μg/L). An increase in serum boron of 100 μg/L in the third trimester corresponded to 0. 9 cm shorter and 120 g lighter newborns (p= 0. 001 and 0. 021, respectively). ConclusionsConsidering that elevated <b>boron</b> <b>concentrations</b> in drinking water are common {{in many areas of}} the world, although more screening is warranted, our novel findings warrant additional research on early-life exposure in other populations...|$|R

40|$|Phytoremediation is a {{promising}} technology to tackle boron toxicity, which restricts agricultural activities in many arid and semi-arid areas. Puccinellia frigida is a perennial grass that {{was reported to}} hyperaccumulate boron in extremely boron-contaminated sites. To further investigate its potential for phytoremediation, we determined its response to boron stress under controlled conditions (hydroponic culture). Also, {{as a first step}} towards understanding the mechanisms underlying its extreme tolerance, we evaluated the presence and expression of genes related with boron tolerance. We found that P. frigida grew normally even at highly toxic <b>boron</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the medium (500 mg/L), and within its tissues (> 5000 mg/kg DW). We postulate that the strategies conferring this extreme tolerance involve both restricting boron accumulation and an internal tolerance mechanism; {{this is consistent with the}} identification of putative genes involved in both mechanisms, including the expression of a possible boron efflux transporter. We also found that P. frigida hyperaccumulated boron over a wide range of <b>boron</b> <b>concentrations.</b> We propose that P. frigida could be used for boron phytoremediation strategies in places with different soil characteristics and <b>boron</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Further studies should pave the way for the development of clean and low-cost solutions to boron toxicity problems.

50|$|Soluble poisons, {{also called}} {{chemical}} shim, produce a spatially uniform neutron absorption when dissolved {{in the water}} coolant. The most common soluble poison in commercial pressurized water reactors (PWR) is boric acid, which {{is often referred to}} as soluble boron. The boric acid in the coolant decreases the thermal utilization factor, causing a decrease in reactivity. By varying the concentration of boric acid in the coolant, a process referred to as boration and dilution, the reactivity of the core can be easily varied. If the <b>boron</b> <b>concentration</b> is increased, the coolant/moderator absorbs more neutrons, adding negative reactivity. If the <b>boron</b> <b>concentration</b> is reduced (dilution), positive reactivity is added. The changing of <b>boron</b> <b>concentration</b> in a PWR is a slow process and is used primarily to compensate for fuel burnout or poison buildup. The variation in <b>boron</b> <b>concentration</b> allows control rod use to be minimized, which results in a flatter flux profile over the core than can be produced by rod insertion. The flatter flux profile occurs because there are no regions of depressed flux like those that would be produced in the vicinity of inserted control rods. This system is not in widespread use because the chemicals make the moderator temperature reactivity coefficient less negative. All commercial PWR types operating in the US (Westinghouse, Combustion Engineering, and Babcock & Wilcox) employ soluble boron to control excess reactivity. US Navy reactors and Boiling Water Reactors do not.|$|E
