5|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge for}} this series was achieving ground clearance for the wing-mounted engine. This {{was overcome by}} reducing the intake fan diameter and relocating the gearbox and other accessories from beneath the engine to the sides.

5|$|Bulker hulls {{are made}} of steel, usually mild steel. Some {{manufacturers}} have preferred high-tensile steel recently {{in order to reduce}} the tare weight. However, the use of high-tensile steel for longitudinal and transverse reinforcements can reduce the hull's rigidity and resistance to corrosion. Forged steel is used for some ship parts, such as the propeller shaft support. Transverse partitions {{are made of}} corrugated iron, reinforced at the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> at connections. The construction of bulker hulls using a concrete-steel sandwich has been investigated.|$|E

5|$|It is Christmas in Bikini <b>Bottom</b> <b>and</b> Plankton is {{miserable and}} angry for {{committing}} so many naughty deeds, {{that he always}} gets on Santa's naughty list, making him unable to receive his Christmas wishthe Krusty Krab's Krabby Patty secret formula. However, he discovers Jerktonium, a dangerous chemical element {{which serves as a}} trap for the citizens of Bikini <b>Bottom</b> <b>and</b> is capable of turning anyone into a jerk. He cooks it into fruitcakes that he intends to feed to all the Bikini Bottomites and turn them into jerks. In order to test it, Plankton gives SpongeBob a slice, but nothing seems to work on SpongeBob, who is immune to Jerktonium because of the combination of his small brain and his very big heart. Increasingly infuriated that his plan has seemingly failed completely to suffice, Plankton gives his fruitcake dispenser to SpongeBob, who promptly distributes the fruitcakes to all of Bikini <b>Bottom</b> <b>and</b> transforms all the residents into jerks. After realizing that the element works only on other people in Bikini Bottom instead and that SpongeBob is so full of Christmas spirit that he is immune to jerktonium, Plankton is forced to send out an evil wind-up robot version of SpongeBob to commit troublesome deeds to frame the real SpongeBob.|$|E

To match {{the look and}} texture of the original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in Knoxville, Tennessee, from which the first batch of stone had been harvested.

The marble was cut into three-inch-thick panels and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks at the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> lighter blocks on top.|$|E

5|$|Mating is {{initiated}} when {{up to five}} males follow closely {{behind a}} female and bite at her fins and body, possibly cued by pheromones indicating the female's readiness. Each male attempts to seize the female by engulfing one of her pectoral fins; at times two males might grasp a female on both sides simultaneously. Once engaged, the sharks sink to the bottom, whereupon the male (or males) rotates one of his claspers forward, inflates the associated siphon sac (a subcutaneous abdominal organ that takes in seawater {{that is used to}} flush sperm into the female), and attempts to make contact with the female's vent. In many cases, the female resists by pressing her belly against the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> arching her tail; this may reflect mate choice on her part. The male has a limited time in which to achieve copulation, as while he is holding the female's pectoral fin in his mouth he is being deprived of oxygen. On the other hand, if the female is willing, the pair settles side-by-side with their heads pressed against the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> their bodies at an upward angle.|$|E
5|$|To {{visually}} {{enhance the}} size of this set, the camera was equipped with a 40mm Panavision wide-angle lens and mounted {{at the opposite end of}} the stage, giving Crosby the ability to frame the scenes in his camera with extra space at the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> at either side. These areas were filled in later by printing-in process extensions of the set, doubling its size onscreen.|$|E
5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the <b>bottom,</b> <b>and</b> then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him out of the water. This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. A diving stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows the divers to rest during the ascent. It also allows the divers to be relatively safely and conveniently lifted {{out of the water and}} returned to the deck or quayside.|$|E

5|$|A {{downline}} {{used for}} open ocean diving {{is much the}} same as a shotline, but does not reach {{all the way to the}} bottom. An open-ocean downline is weighted at the <b>bottom,</b> <b>and</b> attached to a substantial float at the surface, which may be tethered to the boat. It may be marked at intervals by knots or loops, and may be attached to decompression trapeze system. In some cases a sea anchor may be used to limit wind drift, particularly if attached to a boat with significant windage.|$|E
5|$|A later {{branch of}} the Yamashiro tradition, was the Hasebe school which {{was active in the}} Nanboku-chō period and early Muromachi period. It was founded by Hasebe Kunishige who {{originally}} came from Yamato Province. He travelled to Sagami Province where {{he became one of the}} ten great students of Masamune (Masamune juttetsu), and eventually went to Kyoto to found the Hasebe school. The sugata is characterized by a wide mihaba, thin kasane and shallow sori. The jihada is fine itame-hada mixed with masame-hada, chikei and abundant ji-nie. The hamon is of irregular width, narrow and small-patterned at the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> wide and large-patterned at the top of the blade. There are many tobiyaki and hitatsura as well as rough nie.|$|E
5|$|Directly after commissioning, König {{conducted}} sea trials, {{which were}} completed by 23 November 1914. Her crew consisted of 41 officers and 1,095 enlisted men. Afterward, {{the ship was}} attached to the V Division of the IIIBattle Squadron of the German High Seas Fleet, where she would later be joined by her sister ships. On 9 December, König ran aground in the Wilhelmshaven roadstead. Her sister ship Grosser Kurfürst, following right behind, rammed her stern and caused some minor damage. König was then freed from the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> taken back to Wilhelmshaven; repair work lasted until 2 January 1915.|$|E

5|$|Division forms two polyps {{that each}} become {{as large as}} the original. Longitudinal {{division}} begins when a polyp broadens and then divides its coelenteron (body), effectively splitting along its length. The mouth divides and new tentacles form. The two polyps thus created then generate their missing body parts and exoskeleton. Transversal division occurs when polyps and the exoskeleton divide transversally into two parts. This means one has the basal disc (<b>bottom)</b> <b>and</b> the other has the oral disc (top); the new polyps must separately generate the missing pieces.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} half of the 17th century, Swedish {{warships}} were built in the Dutch manner, with a flat, rectangular bottom with a small draft. This shipbuilding style was adapted mainly for smaller ships in the shallow coastal waters of the Netherlands, and allowed for quick construction, but these less sturdy vessels were generally unsuitable as warships and somewhat unstable in rough seas. When Kronan was built, the English approach to building had prevailed, giving hulls a more rounded <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> greater draft, as well as a sturdier frame and increased stability. The stern was more streamlined below the waterline, which lessened resistance.|$|E
5|$|During the floods, {{flow through}} the narrow Wallula Gap was {{restricted}} such that water pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis, which formed in the lowlands of the Columbia Plateau. Lake Lewis backflooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River valleys. This flooding lasted {{for a period of}} 4–7 days. In the relatively calm arms of the lake, the slack waters were thick with suspended materials eroded from the scablands above. Some of the suspended materials settled out, creating thick Touchet Formation layers, or rhythmites, which are found throughout these valleys. The larger clasts settled out first, followed by the finer ones. This resulted in layers with graded bedding, or bedding in which the larger particles are at the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> the smaller ones are at the top.|$|E
