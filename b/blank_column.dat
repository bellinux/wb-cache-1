5000|$|One {{might begin}} making a debt {{repayment}} plan by categorizing secured and unsecured debt, including {{the name of}} the creditor, the total amount owed, when the amount will be paid off, and the current monthly payment. For each debt one would list the current balance, finance charge per month, the minimum payment per month, and include a <b>blank</b> <b>column</b> for the [...] "actual" [...] payment. The amount of the actual payment would be determined from one's spending plan, after subtracting necessary expenses and the amount of money required to support a reasonable quality of life. This amount would then be divided up among the creditors. Ideally, the payment to each creditor is proportional (based on the amount of money owed to the creditor divided by the total liabilities). Creditors should not be given special treatment because they harass a debtor with greater frequency than other creditors. One may, however, give preference to creditors charging higher interest rates, threatening legal action, or who are friends or family members.|$|E
50|$|Like EGA, VGA {{supports}} having up to 512 different simultaneous {{characters on}} screen, albeit in only 8 foreground colors, by rededicating one color bit {{as the highest}} bit of the character number. The glyphs on 80×25 mode are normally made of 9×16 pixels. Users may define their own character set by loading a custom font onto the card. As character data is only eight bits wide on VGA, just as on all of its predecessors, there is usually a blank pixel column between any two horizontally adjacent glyphs. However, some characters are normally made nine bits wide by repeating their last column instead of inserting a <b>blank</b> <b>column,</b> especially those defining horizontally connected IBM box-drawing characters. This functionality is hard-wired to the character numbers C0hex to DFhex, where all horizontally connecting characters are found in code page 437 and its most common derivatives. The same column-repeating trick was already used on the older MDA hardware with its 9×14 pixel glyphs, but on VGA it can be turned off when loading a font in which those character numbers do not represent box drawing characters.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the impact of biological oxygen demand (BOD) on soil and drinking water in West Bank. This study will give us a conclusion about ground water contamination from solid waste and sewage water. The study was performed on two soil samples brought from Jericho and Talkarem. The physical and chemical properties of the two soil samples were analyzed. The experiment was studied using physical simulation by using different soil column techniques and making some estimation using the amount of rainfall each year and the dimensions of those columns. The study was conducted between April and May, 2009. The concentration of BOD in the leachate was found to increase with time in both types of soil, in April the BOD concentration was higher in the leachate from Jericho soil than Talkarem soil, but in May the BOD concentration was higher in Talkarem soil than Jericho soil. The concentration of BOD in the leachate collected from <b>blank</b> <b>column</b> was decreasing with time, the dissolved oxygen (DO) was decreasing with increasing BOD concentration in both soils. The total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration in the leachate was decreasing in both soils with time. The BOD concentration was increasing in the soil layers from top to the bottom in both soils (Talkarem and Jericho), but BOD was higher in Talkarem soil in each layer compared with that in Jericho soil layers. The TDS level in Talkarem soil layers was higher than in Jericho soil layers. The total nitrogen (TN) concentration in soil layers increases with depth and with time during water addition in the <b>blank</b> <b>column</b> but decreases in the soil layers in the columns where BOD was added...|$|E

40|$|Adverse drug reactions, {{including}} severe patient bleeding, {{may occur}} following {{the administration of}} anticoagulant drugs. Bivalirudin is a synthetic anticoagulant drug sometimes employed {{as a substitute for}} heparin, a commonly used anticoagulant that can cause a condition called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Although bivalrudin has the advantage of not causing HIT, a major concern is lack of an antidote for this drug. In contrast, medical professionals can quickly reverse the effects of heparin using protamine. This report details the selection of an aptamer to bivalirudin that functions as an antidote in buffer. This was accomplished by immobilizing the drug on a monolithic column to partition binding sequences from nonbinding sequences using a low-pressure chromatography system and salt gradient elution. The elution profile of binding sequences was compared to that of a <b>blank</b> <b>column</b> (no drug), and fractions with a chromatographic difference were analyzed via real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and used for further selection. Sequences were identified by 454 sequencing and demonstrated low micromolar dissociation constants through fluorescence anisotropy after only two rounds of selection.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the master thesis project is to {{investigate}} the influence of selected serine protease inhibitors (SPI) on the catalytic action of the serine proteases chymotrypsin and trypsin, in a conjugated and non-conjugated state. The inhibitors included {{for this study were}} extracted from Solanum tuberosum, i. e. common potato. The purification method included in this study consist of crude extraction by mixer, followed by a salt-out procedure with ammonium sulphate. Further purification steps were cation exchange chromatography and, finally, gel filtration to obtain SPI of high purity. The purified sample was then characterized by SDS-page and kinetic activity measurement of trypsin and chymotrypsin action on synthetic substrate derivate, N-Benzoyl-DL-arginine- 4 -nitroanilide hydrochloride (BAPA) and N-Succinyl-L-phenylalanine-p-nitroaniline (SFpNA) respectively. The characterization showed inhibitory inactivation of both pancreatic proteases. This would indicate successful extraction of SPI. To investigate inhibitory action in a conjugated state, either enzyme or inhibitor was immobilized onto aluminium oxide membranes. Then two different experimental setups were tested, called experiment 1 and 2. In experiment 1, the inhibitor was immobilized and the interaction was monitored from a retention shift of enzyme flow-through compared to a <b>blank</b> <b>column,</b> using detection at 280 nm of the enzyme. In experiment 2 the enzyme was instead immobilized and a mixture of inhibitor and substrate was circulated with monitoring of the catalytic activity. The main goal was thus to measure the effects on the kinetics in the conjugated state compared to enzyme and inhibitor in the free state. The result from both experiment 1 and 2 did not yield consistent and reliable result so the discussed method should be regarded as preliminary results. The study also includes investigation of inhibitor-enzyme interaction as revealed by molecular mass data to determine complex formation. This part was conducted with static light scattering analysis to determine the stoichiometry for the interaction between pancreas proteases and the inhibitor. Results from light scattering showed promising indication of many-to-one interaction between enzyme and inhibitor, which have been seen by previous studies. It should be considered a preliminary result as complex formation does not exclude aggregation of enzymes or inhibitor in the solution...|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Industrial wastewaters often {{consist of}} a complex {{chemical}} cocktail with treatment of target contaminants complicated by adverse chemical reactions. The impact of metal ions on the removal of fluoride by natural zeolite and calcite was investigated {{in the present study}} via laboratory batch reactor kinetics and column tests. In order to better understand the kinetics, the intra-particle diffusion (IPD), pseudo-second order (PSO) and Hill (Hill 4 and Hill 5) models were applied on the basis of kinetics test results. As these models have different numbers of parameters, model fitting was compared using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Schwarz Bayseian Information Criterion (BIC) methods capable of comparing models having different numbers of parameters. The Hill models (Hill 4 and Hill 5) were found to be superior in describing the fluoride removal processes which reflects the process of chemisorption during fluoride removal. Results indicate that the presence of Mn (100 mg. L - 1) and Cd (100 mg. L - 1) respectively increase the rate of fluoride sorption by zeolite by a factor of ~ 28. 3 and ~ 10. 9, with the maximum sorption capacity increased by a factor ~ 2. 2 and ~ 1. 7. The presence of Ba (100 mg. L - 1) in the zeolite sample initially inhibited fluoride removal and very poor fits were obtained for all models. Fitting was best described with a biphasic sigmoidal model with the degree of inhibition decreasing with increasing temperature suggesting at least two processes are involved with fluoride sorption onto natural zeolite in the presence of Ba. With calcite, results reveal that the presence of Co 2 + adversely affects the process of defluoridation resulting in a lowest amount of fluoride removal in the order Co 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 +. Calculation of reaction half-lives (t 0. 5), a measure of the length of time required to remove 50 % of the initial fluoride mass, showed that t 0. 5 increased in the order Ba 2 + ≈ stonedust 2 + 2 + 2 +, with Mn 2 + and Co 2 + requiring ~ 95 and ~ 140 minutes more to achieve half their respective predicted fluoride removal. Column tests studying the effect of metal ions on fluoride transport in the presence of calcite or zeolite showed that the defluoridation efficiencies of zeolite and calcite are much lower than those in the batch tests, being only ~ 49 % and ~ 20 % respectively. This is attributed {{to the fact that the}} contact between sorbent and sorbate are temporal and spatial in column tests with the residence time much less than experienced during kinetics tests. The addition of Ba 2 + and Cd 2 + in the zeolite column sample respectively decreases the fluoride removal by ~ 13 % and ~ 10 % after four pore volumes had passed through the column while in the calcite sample, Cd 2 + has similar defluoridation amount with the blank (no metals) and the presence of Ba 2 + lowered the amount by ~ 8 % at 4. 5 PV. CXTFIT a program to model 1 D transport processes was used to fit the tracer (Br -) data from each column test. This allows the column characteristics such as the effective porosity, Darcy velocity, and dispersity to be calculated and used to assess the retardation of fluoride. PHREEQC geochemical modelling was also applied to both the kinetics data and the column experimental results. Modelling of the column tests using calcite required the addition of a hypothetical phase with a different solubility than calcite. By varying log k, calcite solubility can be changed with an increasing log k indicating an enhanced calcite dissolution. It is found that the best match achieved between the observed and modelled calcite column data when log k is 1. 1, 0. 75, 1. 2 for the blank, Ba 2 + and Cd 2 + samples respectively. This implies that calcite dissolution is suppressed by the presence of Ba 2 +, which is inconsistent with the findings in the batch reactor kinetics tests. As for the zeolite columns, the log k of LinearF - which defines the phases and the associated hypothetical reactions with F - is altered by trial and error until the best fit is obtained. The log k of LinearF - used in the zeolite <b>blank</b> <b>column</b> is - 100. 05, while it changes to - 100. 22 in the presence of Ba 2 + and Cd 2 +. Results show good fits with the observed data. Geochemical modelling of the kinetics data however was more problematic with the initial instantaneous sorption part of the model curves closely matching the observed data, however the final part of the model curves over predicted fluoride removal. The initial development of the PHREEQ geochemical model presented here shows potential in being able to be used as a predictive tool for the design of fluoride remediation strategies such as permeable reactive barriers...|$|E

Many digital watermarking algorithms were proposed in recent literature. One of the highly addressed issues within the watermarking literature is robustness against attacks.

It firstly splits the watermark (which is a binary logo) into multiple pieces and then embeds each piece in a separate image, hence, this technique is termed 'Multiple Images Watermarking'. The binary logo is generated by extracting unique features from all the images which have to be watermarked. This watermark is first permuted and then embedded using SILE algorithm [7]. Permutation is important step to uniformly distribute the unique characteristics acquired from multiple logos.

In control studies, serum antibodies against the ganglioside GQ 1 b from another neuropathy patient were not depleted by monolithic GM 2 mimic columns. Fluorescence microscopy with FITC-conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin antibodies showed that the immobilized ganglioside mimics were evenly distributed along the column. The columns were able to capture 95 % of the anti-GM 2 antibodies of patients after only 2 min of incubation. A monolithic column of 4. 4 µL can deplete 28. 2 µL of undiluted serum. These columns are potential diagnostic and therapeutic tools for neuropathies related to anti-ganglioside antibodies...|$|R
40|$|A new {{affinity}} {{method for}} quantification of glycated albumin by an enzyme-linked boronate-immunoassay (ELBIA) has been established, {{based on the}} interaction between boronic acids and the cis-diols of glycated human serum albumin (HSA) trapped by anti-HSA antibody. To evaluate the ELBIA, we first examined {{the accuracy of the}} conventional boronate affinity chromatographic (BAC) method. In the BAC method, 8. 1 – 18. 9 % of nonglycated albumin calibrator nonspecifically bound to the boronate affinity column, values that were regarded as the <b>column</b> <b>blank.</b> In the modified BAC method, therefore, we subtracted the <b>column</b> <b>blank</b> value from the measured glycated albumin value to obtain the true value. Because glycated albumin values measured by ELBIA were exactly the same as reported by the modified BAC method, we suggest that the ELBIA results reflect the real status of albumin glycation. We have also developed a fully automated ELBIA system, allowing multiple, rapid, and precise measurements of glycated albumin. The plasma concentration of glycated albumin reflects short-term control of hyperglycemia in diabetes [1]. Affinity-chromatographic methods based on specific interaction of boronic acids with the cis-diols of glycated proteins have been developed [2 – 4] and are widely used for measuring glycated proteins [5]. The affinity-chromatographic method has also been applied to determine serum concentrations of glycated albumin [6]. The shorte...|$|R
50|$|Sandstone {{quarrying}} {{began on}} Newcastle Island in 1869 when Joseph Emery from the United States Mint in San Francisco {{went looking for}} good quality sandstone for their new building. Finding the stone on Newcastle to be exactly {{what he had been}} looking for, he signed a five-year lease with the Vancouver Coal Mining and Land Company to cut stone for the building. Many Americans were angry that their mint would not be built of American stone and this resulted in the Newcastle Island stone being subjected to a battery of tests, all of which it passed with flying colours. It was an appealing white-grey colour; it was easy to remove large blocks because its joints and fractures were few and far between; and it was strong and held up well against weathering because of its unusually high number of quartz grains. The first shipment to San Francisco occurred in the mid-1870s and continued throughout the five years to make the grand total 8000 tons of sandstone removed from Newcastle Island. This stone made up the six <b>blank</b> <b>columns</b> that were 27 ft long and 3 ft in diameter. The San Francisco Mint has survived two major earthquakes. During one earthquake, surrounding fires got hot enough to melt the windows, but the building's interior stayed intact. The San Francisco Mint is no longer in use and is now a national landmark that can still be seen today.Originally, there were to be eight columns for the U.S. Mint, but two of them were on the Zephyr on the night that it was shipwrecked. The Zephyr was a three-masted barque that was built in Medford, Massachusetts in 1855. It arrived at Newcastle Island on January 31, 1872, to take two of the eight sandstone pillars to the U.S. Mint in San Francisco. In stormy weather it left from Departure Bay at 10:00 a.m. on February 12, but on that Monday at 3:30 in the morning, it hit bottom at Mayne Island. Captain Hepson and crewmate James Stewart drowned {{but the rest of the}} crew made it ashore safely. The Zephyr today is commemorated on Newcastle Island with an exhibit about the ship including one of the pillars that had been rescued from the sunken Zephyr.After the success of the Mint, many other companies wanted leases to cut stone. It was used until 1932 for places such as the BC Penitentiary, the Nanaimo Post Office, the Nanaimo Court House, the Bank of Montreal, the British North American Bank of Vancouver, the St. John's Church in Victoria, and the Oddfellows Hall in Victoria.|$|R
40|$|Plasma catecholamines were fluorometrically {{determined}} by a modifica-tion of the standard alumina-trihydroxyindole method in which radioac-tive tracer catecholamines are used to follow the chromatographic behavior of the endogenous catecholamines on alumina. This modification permits appropriate fluorometry of {{that portion of the}} eluate with the highest concentration of catecholamines, because incomplete elution of the total endogenous catecholamines can be corrected by use of the isotope recovery data.

30|$|Catalyst {{evaluation}} {{was carried}} out in a fixed-bed stainless steel reactor at atmospheric pressure. In each run, about 1  g of catalyst (18 / 25 mesh size) diluted with equal amount of quartz beads, was suspended between two quartz wool plugs at the centre of the reactor. Prior to reaction, the catalyst was pretreated in He flow (30  ml/min) at 500  °C for 1  h. C 2 H 6, CO 2 (or O 2) and He were fed into the reactor at a volumetric ratio of 15 / 15 / 30 using mass flow controllers (Alborg, USA). The effluent gas stream was analyzed by an on-line Nucon 5765 GC equipped with TCD using Molecular Sieve 5 A and Porapak Q <b>columns.</b> <b>Blank</b> runs (in the absence of catalyst) with quartz wool revealed no conversion of C 2 H 6 in the studied temperature range 550 – 650  °C.|$|R
