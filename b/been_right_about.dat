5|$|After hearing Sunny on the radio, Robin Hester {{turns up}} in Ramsay Street {{to try to}} get close to her. Sunny {{believes}} he is just being friendly. Robin climbs through Sunny's bedroom window and takes a photo of her. He locks Zeke in Pirate Net's storeroom, so he can spend some time with Sunny alone. Sunny and Robin go to Pirate Net to see if Zeke is there and Robin pretends to find the storeroom key and unlocks the door. Zeke tells Sunny that Robin locked him in the storeroom, but she refuses to believe him. Zeke violently attacks Robin in front of Sunny, scaring her. Zeke apologises and Sunny eventually realises that Zeke had <b>been</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> Robin. Sunny meets Robin at Charlie's and tells him that she and Zeke have broken up. Robin confesses to locking Zeke in the storeroom and tries to kiss Sunny, but Zeke appears and tells Robin to stay away them.|$|E
25|$|By early 1918, the {{government}} in Iași was experiencing a major military crisis. The October Revolution and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk took Russia out of the war, and Ferdinand eventually appointed Marghiloman Premier, allowing him to sign Romania's disadvantageous peace with Germany. Carp, together with the Germanophile diplomat Ioan C. Filitti, also attempted {{to take part in}} brokering this deal, but found the treaty to be very unfair toward his defeated country. Meanwhile, in March, the Bessarabian Moldavian Democratic Republic entered a union with Romania, which, to his contemporaries, seemed to confirm that Carp had <b>been</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> the outcome of war.|$|E
25|$|Billy {{decides to}} head to Molly Ferguson's ranch, believing {{she is the only}} one who will accept his innocence. As Ray tracks Billy to the ranch, he meets a group of Texas Rangers who tell him they are about to attack the ranch because Mr. Ferguson is a rustler. Ray helps them, chasing Billy into the fields, and {{shooting}} him. Billy falls from a mountain into a nearby river. However, at that moment, Ray hears screaming coming from the ranch. He returns to find the Rangers were in fact bandits, who have killed most of the occupants of the house and taken Molly captive. Ray races after them, but they reach the river before he can catch them. In despair, he breaks down, questioning if he has <b>been</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> anything, asking if God has abandoned him, and determining to try to redeem himself by saving Molly.|$|E

25|$|After Nash {{was unable}} to {{convince}} Hogan to re–hire Hall and Waltman and failed to secure a meeting with Eric Bischoff, he {{set his sights on}} renewing his feud with Jeff Jarrett, who claimed that Nash had tried to hurt TNA by bringing Hall and Waltman in. On the August 5 episode of Impact!, Sting, who had feuded with Jarrett prior to his 30-day suspension, returned to TNA and, together with Nash, beat down Jarrett, Bischoff and Hogan. On the August 26 episode of Impact!, Nash defeated Jarrett in a singles match, after an interference from Sting. The following week Nash helped Sting defeat Jarrett. After the match Samoa Joe aligned himself with Jarrett and Hogan and drove Nash and Sting away. At No Surrender Jarrett and Joe defeated Nash and Sting in a tag team match, after Jarrett hit Sting with a baseball bat. On the September 16 episode of Reaction, Nash and Sting were joined by D'Angelo Dinero, who claimed to have gotten inside information from Bischoff's secretary Miss Tessmacher, that would suggest that Nash and Sting were right about Hogan and Bischoff being up to something. At Bound for Glory Nash, Sting and Dinero faced Jeff Jarrett and Samoa Joe in a handicap match, after Hulk Hogan, who was scheduled to team with Jarrett and Joe, was forced to pull out due to back surgery. At the end of the match Jarrett abandoned Joe and left him to be pinned by Nash. At the end of the event it was revealed that Nash and Sting had <b>been</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> Hogan and Bischoff all along, as they aligned themselves with Jarrett, Abyss and Jeff Hardy. On October 13, 2010, Nash's contract with TNA expired and he announced his retirement from professional wrestling. His last TNA appearance was a taped broadcast on October 14, 2010, when Nash and Sting both announced they were walking away from TNA rather than being a part of Hogan and Bischoff's regime. In January 2011 Nash signed a new contract with TNA, but was granted a release before reappearing on television, after being contacted by WWE.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} stages of the war between AAA and La Sociedad, Cibernético was one of the top técnicos {{fighting}} for AAA. On October 1, 2010, at Héroes Inmortales IV, he was scheduled to team up Heavy Metal, La Parka and Octagón against a team of La Sociedad representatives, but prior to the match Konnan announced that Cibernético had decided to turn his back on AAA and join his team instead. AAA bought Konnan's claim and replaced Cibernético and Octagón, who was injured in a backstage assault by someone resembling Cibernético, in the match with Dark Ozz and Dark Cuervo. However, in the end Cibernético interfered in the match and helped AAA pick up the win. Afterwards, Cibernético, upset with AAA and in particular his friend La Parka for believing he had turned on the company, decided to re–form his old group Los Bizarros with Amadeus, Escoria, Nygma and Taboo. Cibernético made clear that even though Los Bizarros were no longer with AAA, they were not part of La Sociedad either, solidifying the group's status as tweeners. He also tried to recruit his friend El Mesías to join the group, but he decided to stay out of the war of words between his two friends. On November 22, the feud between Cibernético and La Parka turned physical, when Los Bizarros ran out to save El Mesías from a beatdown at the hands of La Sociedad, without making the save for La Parka and Jack Evans. When Parka confronted Cibernético, he was laid out with a stunner, after which Los Bizarros beat him down and Cibernético ripped his mask off his face. The first major battle between Cibernético and La Parka took place on December 5, 2010, at Guerra de Titanes, where Parka teamed up with Dark Espíritu, Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans to defeat Cibernético, Escoria, Nygma and Taboo. After the match, Los Bizarros once again beat down La Parka, after which Cibernético admitted that while Super Fly had been outed as the man who had attacked Octagón prior to Héroes Inmortales IV, he was in fact the one who had orchestrated the attack, meaning that Parka had <b>been</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> him all along. He then introduced the returning Charly Manson, who had most recently worked for rival promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), as the newest member of Los Bizarros. The group's lineup would be finalized a couple of months later with the addition of Billy el Malo, who jumped to Los Bizarros from La Sociedad. Cibernético and La Parka continued their heated rivalry the following months during which it was implied that Cibernético had assaulted and hospitalized Parka's three-year-old son, his own godson, with a broken leg and even provided X-rays, which he used to taunt Parka with. At March's Rey de Reyes, Los Bizarros, represented by Cibernético, Billy el Malo, Escoria and Nygma defeated La Parka, Jack Evans, Joe Líder and Nicho el Millonario, after which Cibernético threatened to light Parka on fire, before being driven out of the ring by Nicho. In May, La Parka formed his own group El Inframundo ("The Underworld") with Dark Ozz, Dark Cuervo, Dark Espíritu and the recently debuted Drago to counteract Los Bizarros. On May 13, La Parka challenged Cibernético to a battle of the groups at Triplemanía XIX, which he accepted. It was later revealed that for the event Parka's team would be joined by Octagón, looking for revenge for what happened to him nine months earlier. During the event, Octagón would also become the fifth inductee into the AAA Hall of Fame, following in the footsteps of Antonio Peña, Rey Mysterio Jr., Eddie Guerrero and Pepe Casas.|$|E
500|$|In a 2010 Oprah interview, Presley {{admitted}} that they spent {{four years after the}} divorce [...] "getting back together and breaking up", until she felt she [...] "had to push it away." [...] She described the parallels between the lives of Jackson and her father Elvis, and said Jackson constantly asked her about the details of Elvis' death because he felt that he was [...] "going to end up the same way." [...] She had described such a conversation in a blog post the day after Jackson died, wherein she shared her feelings about his death. According to Presley, the last [...] "coherently good conversation" [...] she had with Jackson was in 2005. She said Jackson told her she had <b>been</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> certain people around him, whom she called [...] "vampires." [...] She replied that she was indifferent when he asked if she still loved him. [...] But Presley also said his death made her realize he loved her. She acknowledged his efforts in the relationship, saying, [...] "He honestly tried so hard and went through so much with me", but [...] "I didn’t appreciate it then and I wish I did." [...] At the end of the conversation, he reportedly told her [...] "he felt that someone {{was going to try to}} kill him to get a hold of his catalog and his estate" [...] and named some names she didn't want to say in the interview.|$|E

[...] Hogan subsequently {{turned his back on}} the fans and joined Hall and Nash to form the New World Order (nWo). Despite no longer being a fan favorite, Heenan continued to bash Hogan on commentary by gloating that he had <b>been</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> him all along, continuing a rivalry that dated back to their time in AWA.|$|E

2500|$|After assaulting Jarrett {{from behind}} on the June 24 edition of Impact!, TNA {{president}} Dixie Carter suspended Sting for 30 days without pay the following week. Sting returned from his suspension on the August 5 edition of Impact!, wearing his nWo Wolfpac red face paint, and helping Kevin Nash, who had backed him up during his suspension, beat down Jarrett, Eric Bischoff and Hulk Hogan. On the September 2 edition of Impact! Sting defeated Jarrett in a singles match, after an interference from Nash. After the match Samoa Joe aligned himself with Jarrett and Hogan and drove Sting and Nash away. At No Surrender Joe and Jarrett defeated Sting and Nash in a tag team match, after Jarrett hit Sting with his own baseball bat. On the September 16 edition of Reaction, Sting and Nash were joined by D'Angelo Dinero, {{who claimed to have}} gotten inside information from Bischoff's secretary Miss Tessmacher, that would suggest that Sting and Nash were right about Hogan and Bischoff being up to something.

At the end of the match Jarrett abandoned Joe, and Sting, Nash, and Dinero tried to tell Joe this was what they were saying all along. Joe fought them anyway and ended up pinned by Nash. At the end of the event it was revealed that Sting had <b>been</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> Hogan and Bischoff all along, as they turned heel with Jarrett and Jeff Hardy as Abyss's [...] "they", and in the process turned Sting, Nash and Dinero back to being faces. On the following edition of Impact!, Sting and Nash refused to join Hogan, Bischoff and their new group, Immortal, and walked out on TNA and Dixie Carter, noting that they had tried to warn her that Hogan and Bischoff would try to take over the company for their own gain, but she hadn't listened, meaning Sting was never a true villain his entire heel run. After Impact!, Sting took hiatus from TNA television, as Borden's TNA contract had expired at the end of 2010.|$|E

6000|$|There was no {{particular}} reason why I should be irritated, since time {{in those days was}} of no great account in Zululand, and it did not much matter to me whether I trekked in the morning or the afternoon.

During the noon hour no one thought of going on deck unless it was absolutely necessary. Refreshments of any kind were at a premium, and when a society known as the Colonial Dames sent {{on a number of}} boxes of oranges and lemons for distribution, the jackies could hardly contain themselves for joy.

6000|$|I {{perceived}} that {{my friend was}} a capitalist, and I suspected him {{of being one of}} the directors of the penny-chair company. But perhaps he thought me a capitalist, too, and fancied that I would like to have him decry the unemployed. Still he may have <b>been</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> the blackmailing; one must live, and the innocent courage of open-air courtship in London offers occasions of wilful misconstruction. In a great city, the sense of being probably unnoted and unknown among its myriads must eventuate in much indifference to one's surroundings. How should a young couple on an omnibus-top imagine that a stranger in the seat opposite could not help overhearing the tender dialogue in which they renewed their love after some previous falling out? ...|$|E
