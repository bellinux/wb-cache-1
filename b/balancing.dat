5000|$|In some situations, {{terms on}} either side of the global <b>balance</b> {{equations}} cancel. The global <b>balance</b> equations can then be partitioned to give a set of local <b>balance</b> equations (also known as partial <b>balance</b> equations, independent <b>balance</b> equations or individual <b>balance</b> equations). These <b>balance</b> equations were first considered by Peter Whittle. The resulting equations are somewhere between detailed <b>balance</b> and global <b>balance</b> equations. Any solution [...] to the local <b>balance</b> equations is always a solution to the global <b>balance</b> equations (we can recover the global <b>balance</b> equations by summing the relevant local <b>balance</b> equations), but the converse is not always true. Often, constructing local <b>balance</b> equations is equivalent to removing the outer summations in the global <b>balance</b> equations for certain terms.|$|R

5|$|Some {{forms of}} <b>balancing</b> {{selection}} do {{not result in}} fixation, but maintain an allele at intermediate frequencies in a population. This can occur in diploid species (with pairs of chromosomes) when heterozygous individuals (with just one copy of the allele) have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals (with two copies). This is called heterozygote advantage or over-dominance, of which the best-known example is the resistance to malaria in humans heterozygous for sickle-cell anaemia. Maintenance of allelic variation can also occur through disruptive or diversifying selection, which favours genotypes that depart from the average in either direction (that is, the opposite of over-dominance), and {{can result in a}} bimodal distribution of trait values. Finally, <b>balancing</b> selection can occur through frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of one particular phenotype depends on the distribution of other phenotypes in the population. The principles of game theory have been applied to understand the fitness distributions in these situations, particularly in the study of kin selection and the evolution of reciprocal altruism.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between <b>balance</b> lost on <b>balance</b> beam during the series performed by women gymnasts at International Bosphorus Gymnastics Tournament with anthropometric characteristics and static-dynamic <b>balance</b> test scores. 19 female gymnasts (ages 14, 53 ± 2, 20, training years 9, 0 ± 3) participated in this research voluntarily. Before the competition, the static and dynamic <b>balance</b> score and anthropometrics values were taken by experienced researchers. In order to analyze <b>balance</b> loss on <b>balance</b> beam routines were evaluated by four international judges. The relationship between <b>balance</b> lost on <b>balance</b> beam and <b>balance</b> abilities were tested by “Pearson Correlation Analysis”. As a result although there were a negative relationship between dynamic <b>balance</b> parameters with age, training experience, some anthropometric features (p 0, 05). There were high negative relationship between final score and <b>balance</b> lost in <b>balance</b> beam series (p 0, 05). Artistic gymnastics training contribute positively to the improvement of <b>balance</b> skills, which may have enabled the gymnasts to preserve their <b>balances</b> perfectly, even under difficult circumstances. It can be summarized that the ability of the gymnasts in preserving their <b>balances</b> in similar degree, both during competition and during the tests given under laboratory conditions, can be an outcome of their improved <b>balance</b> skills acquired through exercise...|$|R
