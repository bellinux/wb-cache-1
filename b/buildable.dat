5|$|The {{major areas}} that are highly {{productive}} and <b>buildable</b> are basically in Tablas and Sibuyan. These include Odiongan, San Andres, Looc and Santa Fe in Tablas Island. All three municipalities in Sibuyan Island, on the other hand, have substantial level to gently sloping lands. Overall, good developable lands represent about 13 percent of the province’s total area.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} demands of the arrivals, ships bearing goods from around the world came to San Francisco as well. Ships' captains found that their crews deserted to go to the goldfields. The wharves and docks of San Francisco became a forest of masts, as {{hundreds}} of ships were abandoned. Enterprising San Franciscans turned the abandoned ships into warehouses, stores, taverns, hotels, and one into a jail. Many of these ships were later destroyed and used for landfill to create more <b>buildable</b> land in the boomtown.|$|E
5|$|The Halo {{franchise}} {{has produced}} numerous merchandising partnerships, {{and the characters}} of Halo have likewise been featured {{in a variety of}} products. The Master Chief, being the symbol of the franchise, has appeared on everything from soda to T-shirts and mugs. At one point, marketers for Halo 3 were planning on producing Cortana-themed lingerie. There have also been several series of licensed action figures produced, with the Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2 collectibles being produced by Joyride Studios in several series. For Halo 3, the responsibility of designing the action figures was given to McFarlane Toys; a total of eight series have been announced, with ninth series devoted to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the franchise by re-issuing a few of the earlier figurines along with pieces to construct a <b>buildable</b> plaque of the Legendary icon used in the game for the hardest skill level. Kotobukiya produced high-end figurines. Besides general figures like Covenant Elites and Spartans, figurines produced include the Master Chief, Cortana, Arbiter, Prophet of Regret, Tartarus, and Sergeant Johnson.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} bridge design, a cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge, was {{put forward}} by the Jasmax architectural firm, which noted that the 'Anzac Centenary Bridge' would be <b>buildable</b> {{in time for the}} 100-year memorial of the Gallipoli landings in 1915.|$|E
25|$|Lego Atlantis was {{a product}} range of the {{construction}} toy Lego, themed around the underwater world of Atlantis. The range was announced in 2009, for launch in early 2010, and was discontinued {{by the end of}} 2011. Sets included models of <b>buildable</b> underwater vehicles, as well as 'heroic diver' and 'shark warrior' minifigures. A ride based on the range was operated at Legoland Windsor.|$|E
25|$|Before its {{transformation}} into <b>buildable</b> land by a 19th-century filling project, the Back Bay was literally a bay, {{west of the}} Shawmut Peninsula (on the far side from Boston Harbor) between Boston and Cambridge, the Charles River entering from the west. This bay was tidal: the water rose and fell several feet {{over the course of}} each day, and at low tide much of the bay's bed was exposed as a marshy flat.|$|E
25|$|In the city, the {{population}} was spread out with 29.7% {{under the age of}} 18, 7.2% from 18 to 24, 33.1% from 25 to 44, 24.4% from 45 to 64, and 5.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females there were 95.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.4 males. For several years, the city's population was among the fastest growing in Minnesota, but it has virtually exhausted the amount of additional <b>buildable</b> land within city limits, and so its growth has slowed considerably since 1990.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 19th century, Jamaica Plain's housing stock grew with the {{commercial}} development, providing homes for workers in local businesses and commuters as well. Sumner Hill, {{based on the}} old Greenough estate, became home to business owners and managers. In the 1880s, the Parley Vale estate and Robinwood Avenue were developed to serve the same market. Ten years later, Moss Hill Road and Woodland Road were laid out on land owned by the Bowditch family, creating the most exclusive neighborhood in Jamaica Plain until this day. At the same time, the land off South Street was being developed into streets and filled with houses for the working-class population, especially the Irish. By the early 20th century, the streets of Jamaica Plain were filled in, and houses or businesses were on most <b>buildable</b> plots. The entire housing stock of Jamaica Plain had been owned, divided, financed, built and sold largely by Jamaica Plain residents.|$|E
25|$|To {{mitigate}} {{the impact on}} landowners who lost the right to build on their property due to the view shed restrictions, the county adopted an unusual transfer of development rights ordinance. It allows {{the owner of a}} property that cannot be developed to transfer that right to another piece of land where building is permitted. To take advantage of the transfer, the owner must dedicate a permanent, irrevocable scenic easement to the county that prohibits residential and commercial use of the property. To encourage adoption of the land use policy, the county offered landowners a two-for-one transfer ratio. Planners recognize that a view of the ocean is worth twice an inland view. For each <b>buildable</b> parcel given up by an owner, they receive the right to transfer their credit to two locations, as long as the usage meets the land use policy restrictions such as density. , eight impacted parcels have been leveraged into 16 transfer rights, and nine of those have been used since the program was implemented in 1988.|$|E
500|$|Assembly Square (set number: 10255) is {{the twelfth}} {{set in the}} Modular Building line. It was {{released}} on 1st January, 2017. This set contains the most pieces of any previous modular set at 4002 pieces. The Assembly Square ground level features a bakery with counter, cash register, shelves, opening oven, wedding cake and assorted <b>buildable</b> pastries and treats; a florist’s shop with counter, cash register, garden tools, flower arrangements, bouquets and a blue and yellow macaw parrot element; and a café with espresso machine, counter, bench seating and pie elements. [...] The middle level features a music store with a <b>buildable</b> drum set, two guitars and saxophone element; photo studio with <b>buildable</b> classic camera and adjustable tripod; and a dental office with <b>buildable</b> reclining chair, waiting area, telephone and a sink. The upper level features a dance studio with <b>buildable</b> piano and reflective mirror element; an apartment with <b>buildable</b> foldout sofa bed, detailed kitchen, toilet, micro LEGO® train, modular buildings and Eiffel Tower, and access to a rooftop terrace with <b>buildable</b> barbecue, table and a neglected plant. [...] This set marks the 10th Anniversary of the Modular building sets.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to its primary functions, the building is slated to include {{a significant amount of}} retail as well as a wide variety of other unique amenities with the intention that it functions as a nearly self-sustaining entity, approaching the concept of a [...] "vertical city". The building's design has been applauded as simplistic and <b>buildable,</b> yet bold, brilliantly sculpted, and high-tech, with AS + GG describing it as [...] "an elegant, cost-efficient and highly constructible design." [...] The estimated construction cost of US$1.23 billion, which is less than that of the Burj Khalifa (US$1.5 billion), can be attributed to cheap labor in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia, and that three shifts will work around the clock to expedite the process. Construction costs have also declined since the global financial crisis.|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s, Democratic Senator Jennings Randolph of West Virginia led a {{group of}} lawmakers calling for a federal peace institute. [...] USIP was {{established}} by Congress in 1984 and for many years rented office space in various buildings in downtown Washington, the last being 1200 17th Street NW. [...] In 1996, Congress approved a site on the National Mall for USIP. [...] The site chosen for a new headquarters, the first permanent home for the USIP, was {{on the corner of}} 23rd Street and Constitution Avenue NW in Foggy Bottom. [...] It was previously a parking lot for Bureau of Medicine and Surgery employees at the adjacent Old Naval Observatory. [...] The land was transferred to the USIP without charge with an agreement that underground parking spaces would be built for the Navy employees. [...] The site is on the northwest corner and last <b>buildable</b> site available on the National Mall, overlooking the Lincoln Memorial, and {{across the street from the}} historic American Institute of Pharmacy Building.|$|E
500|$|In July 2011, {{a report}} by {{consultancy}} EC Harris found that Saudi Arabia is the cheapest country in the Middle East to build in, half as expensive as Bahrain, and 34% cheaper than the United Arab Emirates, where Burj Khalifa is located. The future towers' site is located in very close proximity to King Abdulaziz (Jeddah) International Airport, whose runways nearly align with the towers' site, which will {{have an effect on}} the airspace. While skyscraper experts have stated that towers well over one kilometre, even two kilometres (6,562 feet) high, are technically <b>buildable,</b> physical sustainability and practicality issues come into play in towers of this height. From a real estate perspective, it is considered virtually impossible to create enough demand to justify such a tower, but that at some point someone with a great excess of money will likely do it anyway. As for physical restraints, Bart Leclercq, head of structures for WSP Middle East recently said, [...] "I truly believe that 1 mile—1.6 kilometres—is within range. Over that, it may be possible if there are improvements in concrete quality. But 2km is too big a figure –it's just a step too far at the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|The central ship of the player's fleet is the mothership, a large base {{which can}} {{construct}} other ships; unlike other spacecraft, in the single-player campaign the mothership {{is unable to}} move. Present in each level are stationary rocks or dust clouds, which can be mined by specialized harvesting ships which then empty their loads at the mothership {{in the form of}} [...] "resources", the game's only currency. Resources can be spent by the player on building new ships, which are constructed by the mothership. <b>Buildable</b> ships {{come in a variety of}} types, which are discovered over the course of the game. They include resource harvester ships, small fighter ships, frigates, destroyers, and heavy cruisers, as well as specialized ships such as research vessels and repair corvettes. Fighter ships need to return to the mothership periodically to refuel, while salvage corvettes can capture enemy ships and tow them to the mothership to become part of the player's fleet. In some levels, new ship types can be unlocked by capturing an enemy ship of that type, through research performed at the research vessel, or through plot elements. At the beginning of the campaign, the player may select between controlling the [...] "Kushan" [...] or [...] "Taiidan" [...] fleet; this affects the designs of the ships and changes some of the specialized ship options, but has no effect on the plot or gameplay.|$|E

Each lot had an area of between 200 and 300 tsubo (about 660 to 990m2), and the total <b>buildable</b> area of the settlement, subtracting the roads, amounted to 49,645 tsubo (about 16.4 hectares) as of 1885.|$|E
2500|$|Sun's {{goal was}} to replace the parts that remain {{proprietary}} and closed-source with alternative implementations and make the class library completely free and open source. In the meantime, a third-party project called IcedTea created a completely free and highly usable JDK by replacing encumbered code with either stubs or code from GNU Classpath. However OpenJDK has since become <b>buildable</b> without the encumbered parts (from OpenJDK 6 b10) and has become the default runtime environment for most Linux distributions.|$|E
2500|$|All Chrome {{channels}} are automatically distributed {{according to their}} respective release cycles. The mechanism differs by platform. On Windows, it uses Google Update, and auto-update can be controlled via Group Policy. Alternatively, users may download a standalone installer of a version of Chrome that does not auto-update. On OS X, it uses Google Update Service, and auto-update can be controlled via the OS X [...] "defaults" [...] system. On Linux, it lets the system's normal package management system supply the updates. This auto-updating behavior is a key difference from Chromium, the non-branded open source browser which forms the core of Google Chrome. Because Chromium also serves as the pre-release development trunk for Chrome, its revisions are provided as source code and <b>buildable</b> snapshots are produced continuously with each new commit, requiring users to manage their own browser updates.|$|E
2500|$|The {{weight of}} a truss member depends {{directly}} on its cross section—that weight partially determines how strong {{the other members of}} the truss need to be. Giving one member a larger cross section than on a previous iteration requires giving other members a larger cross section as well, to hold the greater weight of the first member—one needs to go through another iteration to find exactly how much greater the other members need to be. Sometimes the designer goes through several iterations of the design process to converge on the [...] "right" [...] cross section for each member. On the other hand, reducing the size of one member from the previous iteration merely makes the other members have a larger (and more expensive) safety factor than is technically necessary, but doesn't require another iteration to find a <b>buildable</b> truss.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the video}} game Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, the player can {{construct}} a city improvement called an [...] "Orbital Power Transmitter" [...] which, while expensive, provides energy to all other cities. Constructing many of these results in huge bonuses to energy production for all cities the player owns. In the novel [...] "Skyfall" [...] (1976) by Harry Harrison an attempt to launch the core of powersat from Cape Canaveral ends in disaster when the launch vehicle fails trapping the payload in a decaying orbit. Several SimCity games have featured space-microwave power plants as <b>buildable</b> options for municipal energy, along with (unrealistic) disaster scenarios where the beam strays off the collector and sets fire to nearby areas. In the manga and anime Mobile Suit Gundam 00, an orbital ring containing multiple solar collectors and microwave transmitters, along with power stations and space elevators for carrying power back down to Earth's surface, are {{the primary source of}} electricity for the Earth in the 24th century.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first wave}} of Bionicle sets were {{initially}} launched in December 2000 in Europe and Australasia as a [...] "test market" [...] to predict how well the sets would sell in North America.

After a positive reception, Bionicle premiered in mid-2001 to North America where generating massive success and earned the Lego Group £100 million in its first year. New sets were released every six months and ranged from <b>buildable</b> action figures to constructive play sets and vehicles while also increasing in size and flexibility. A number of collectibles were also incorporated into the set waves, such as weapon ammo and the [...] "Kanohi" [...] masks that certain characters wore, some of which became rare and valuable and withheld secret codes that when entered onto the official Bionicle website provided the user with [...] "Kanoka Points", enabling them to access exclusive membership material.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gateway to}} Waiheke, where the main {{pedestrian}} ferry lands over 1 million passengers per year, is a valley and harbour called Matiatia. In 2000 it {{was purchased by}} three investors in Waitemata Infrastructure Ltd (WIL). In 2002 WIL proposed to change the Operative District Plan rules for their land to build a major shopping and hotel complex with [...] of gross floor area on <b>buildable</b> land of approximately 3 hectares. This united {{the residents of the}} island in opposition. Over 1,500 adult residents of the island (out of perhaps 3,000) joined together in an incorporated society, the Community and People of Waiheke Island (CAPOW), to oppose the private plan change in court. Church Bay resident and former newsreader John Hawkesby became [...] "the voice of the campaign" [...] that included a showdown with then mayor, John Banks, when Hawkesby made a deputation to the city council hours after the press revealed that Banks was in business with two (of three) directors of WIL.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, due to {{the volume}} of adverse {{possession}} and boundary dispute cases throughout New York City, the New York State Legislature amended and limited the ability of land to be acquired by adverse possession. [...] Prior to the 2008 amendment, to acquire property by adverse possession, all that was required was a showing that the possession constituted an actual invasion of or infringement upon the owner’s rights. Approximately eight (8) years after the 2008 amendment, on June 30, 2016, the New York State Appellate Division, First Department (i.e., the appellate court covering the territory of Manhattan) determined the legal questions concerning the scope of rights acquired by adverse possession and how the First Department would treat claims of adverse possession where title had vested prior to 2008. [...] The Court specifically held that title to the adversely possessed property vested when the plaintiff [...] "atisfie the requirement of the statute in effect at the relevant time." [...] In other words, if title had vested at some time [...] "after" [...] the 2008 amendment, a plaintiff would have to satisfy the adverse possession standards amended by the New York State Legislature in 2008; however, if title vested at some time [...] "before" [...] the 2008 amendment, a plaintiff would have lawfully acquired title to the disputed area by satisfying the pre-amendment standard for adverse possession. [...] Hudson Square Hotel also resolved two often highly litigated issues in adverse possession cases where the air rights are more valuable than the underlying land itself: (a) [...] "where" [...] (i.e., in three-dimensional physical space) is an encroachment required in order for such encroachment to have any relevant operative effect or consequences under the law of adverse possession, and (b) [...] "what" [...] property rights are acquired {{as a result of}} title to the ground floor area (i.e., the land) vesting with the plaintiff. [...] In Hudson Square Hotel the defendant argued that the plaintiff had only acquired title to the underlying land, but not the air rights, because the plaintiff never encroached above the two-story building. [...] This argument was motivated, in part, {{by the fact that the}} zoning laws at the time permitted the owner of the land to build (i.e., develop) up to six (6) times the square footage of the ground floor area. [...] For example, if the disputed area was 1,000 square feet, there would be 6,000 square feet of <b>buildable</b> square footage to potentially be won or lost by adverse possession. [...] The Court clarified, [...] "It is the encroachment on the land ... that allows title to pass to the adverse possessor." [...] In other words, the plaintiff did not need to encroach upon all six stories in order to adversely possess the air rights above the land. [...] The Court also held, [...] "With title to land come air rights." [...] In other words, by acquiring title to the land (i.e., ground floor area), the plaintiff also acquired ownership of the more valuable air rights that were derivative of title to the underlying land.|$|E
