5|$|The {{conclave}} {{began on}} February 15, 1769. Initially only 27 cardinals participated. Zelanti, {{taking advantage of}} the small number of the electors and the absence of the French and Spanish cardinals, tried to achieve a quick election of Cardinal Flavio Chigi. In one ballot he was only two votes short of being elected. The efforts of Zelanti met with strong protests from the ambassadors of France and Spain, <b>but,</b> <b>fortunately</b> for them, Cardinal Orsini, protector of the Kingdom of Naples and the only crown-cardinal present in the early ballots, was able to join some neutral cardinals to block Chigi’s candidature.|$|E
5|$|As soon as Gibraltar was captured, the Alliance {{set about}} {{preparing}} for a Bourbon counter-attack. The Alliance fleet sailed a short distance across the strait to Tetuan in Morocco, where it took on fresh water. On 22 August, a French fleet was sighted in the strait but began to withdraw after being spotted. Rooke {{caught up with the}} French off Málaga on 24 August and attacked, in a bid to prevent the French from slipping past him and attacking Gibraltar. The two fleets were evenly matched but the French ships were faster and had more ammunition than the confederates. They did not manage to make this advantage count, however, and the Battle of Vélez-Málaga was effectively fought to a draw. No ships were sunk but both fleets took very heavy casualties with around 3,000 killed or wounded on each side, including the French commander. The Anglo-Dutch fleet was hampered by a shortage of shot and gunpowder, much of which had already been used in bombarding Gibraltar during the operation to capture it, and Sir George Byng's squadron was forced to pull back when it ran out of ammunition. The rest of the fleet was dangerously low on ammunition <b>but</b> <b>fortunately</b> for the confederates, the French withdrew the following day, leaving the Anglo-Dutch fleet to limp back to Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{expected}} Italy (with its African possessions) {{to join the}} war on Germany's side {{as soon as it}} began, <b>but</b> <b>fortunately</b> for the Allies this did not immediately occur. No.1 Squadron SRAF was already in northern Kenya, having been posted to the Italian East African frontier at Britain's request in late August. The first Southern Rhodesian ground forces to be deployed abroad during World War II were 50Territorial troops under Captain TG Standing, who were posted to Nyasaland in September {{at the request of the}} colonial authorities there to guard against a possible uprising by German expatriates. They returned home after a month having seen little action. White Rhodesian officers and non-commissioned officers left the colony in September and October 1939 to command units of black Africans in the west and east of the continent, with most joining the Royal West African Frontier Force (RWAFF) in Nigeria, the Gold Coast and neighbouring colonies. The deployment of white Rhodesian officers and NCOs to command black troops from elsewhere in Africa met with favour from the military leadership and became very prevalent.|$|E

5|$|The {{family was}} clearly in some {{financial}} difficulty for, in 1604, Mercator's library of some 1000 books was {{sold at a}} public auction in Leyden (Netherlands). The only known copy of the sale catalogue perished in the war <b>but</b> <b>fortunately</b> a manuscript copy {{had been made by}} Van Raemdonck in 1891 and this was rediscovered in 1987. Of the titles identified there are 193 on theology (both Catholic and Lutheran), 217 on history and geography, 202 on mathematics (in its widest sense), 32 on medicine and over 100 simply classified (by Basson) as rare books. The contents of the library provide an insight into Mercator's intellectual studies but the mathematics books are the only ones to have been subjected to scholarly analysis: they cover arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry, surveying, architecture, fortification, astronomy, astrology, time measurement, calendar calculation, scientific instruments, cartography and applications. Only one of his own copies has been found—a first edition of Copernicus's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium annotated in Mercator's hand: this is held by Glasgow University.|$|E
5|$|With Cooke dead, Cumby assumed command. Bellerophons decks {{had largely}} been cleared by French fire, and {{boarding}} parties {{began to make}} their way onto the ship. Several French sailors climbed out onto Bellerophons spritsail yard, but a Bellerophon crewman released the brace holding the yard, causing them to fall into the sea. French sailors holding onto Bellerophons rails had their hands beaten until they were forced to let go. Bellerophons ensign had been shot away three times, so infuriating her yeoman of signals, Christopher Beaty, that he took the largest Union Jack he could find and climbed up into the mizzen rigging and hoisted it across the shrouds. The French riflemen on Aigle reportedly held their fire as he did this, in admiration of his bravery. The two ships were so close together that gun crews on their lower decks were fighting hand to hand at the gunports, while grenades lobbed through the ports caused heavy casualties. One grenade thrown into Bellerophon exploded in the gunner's storeroom, blowing open the door <b>but</b> <b>fortunately</b> blowing closed the door of the magazine. The resulting fire was quickly extinguished, preventing a catastrophic explosion.|$|E
5|$|LeMond {{had planned}} to defend his title in the 1987 Tour de France with La Vie Claire, but {{he was unable to}} participate. Earlier that year, while riding in the Tirreno–Adriatico spring tune-up race, LeMond fell and {{fractured}} his left wrist. He returned to the United States to recover from the injury. The week before returning to Europe, he went turkey hunting on a ranch co-owned by his father in Lincoln, California – in the Sacramento Valley of Northern California. LeMond was with Rodney Barber and Patrick Blades, his uncle and brother-in-law. The trio had become separated when Blades, who heard movement behind him, turned and fired through a bush. The movement had come from LeMond, who was hit in his back and right side with a devastating blast of approximately 60 No. 2-sized pellets. LeMond's injuries were life-threatening, <b>but</b> <b>fortunately,</b> a police helicopter was already airborne near the scene and transported LeMond on a 15-minute air medical flight to the Medical Center at University of California-Davis. LeMond was taken for emergency surgery. He had suffered a pneumothorax to his right lung and extensive bleeding, having lost some 65 percent of his blood volume. A physician informed LeMond later that he had been within 20 minutes of bleeding to death. The operation saved his life, but four months later he developed a small bowel obstruction due to adhesions that had formed following the shooting. He underwent another surgery to relieve the obstruction and take down the adhesions. Concerned that his team would drop him if they knew the shooting accident required a second surgery, LeMond asked the surgeons to remove his appendix at the same time. He then informed his team that he had had his appendix removed, {{but the rest of the}} story was left somewhat vague. The events effectively ended his 1987 season, and in October he announced he would return to serious competition the following February, with the Dutch PDM team.|$|E

25|$|None of the {{aforementioned}} films were box office successes, <b>but</b> <b>fortunately</b> Morricone was also commissioned for more successful motion pictures such as In the Line of Fire (1993) by Wolfgang Petersen, starring Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich, the horror film Wolf (1994, Mike Nichols), which featured Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer in the lead roles, and Bulworth by Warren Beatty.|$|E
25|$|The graphic (right) shows many {{important}} laser/aviation safety concepts. For example, {{it shows that}} the areas of most concern—eye damage, flash blindness and glare—occur relatively close to the aircraft. The distraction risk covers the longest hazard distance, <b>but</b> <b>fortunately</b> also presents the least concern. The photos in the graphic also give an idea of what the visual effect looks like to the pilot, at various distances.|$|E
25|$|The {{horse was}} badly hurt and the waggonette smashed. Mr Simpson of Langslie Farm, {{conveyed}} the ladies {{home in his}} machine and they were afterwards attended by Dr Milroy and Nurse Cooper. Miss Cochrane-Patrick was almost unconscious from bruises and shock and Miss Harriet Cochrane-Patrick was also bruised, <b>but</b> <b>fortunately</b> no bones were broken. Both ladies were very popular for their charitable work in the Kilbirnie and Beith districts.|$|E

25|$|Singapore's {{bilateral}} post-independence {{relationship with}} Malaysia {{is complex and}} rocky at times. Despite their differences, Malaysia remains an important, albeit partial, economic hinterland and a regional ally, especially due to both their memberships in ASEAN. This importance becomes especially apparent when considering that much of Singapore's water supply comes from Malaysia. Both countries {{have been known to}} chide or even issue threats to the other due to differences in paths taken after independence, <b>but</b> <b>fortunately</b> this has never become serious enough to develop into embargo or hostility.|$|E
25|$|The car was {{unveiled}} in 1996 at the IMSA GT Championship, {{with the team}} Canaska Southwind, which competed in the GTS-1 class, the highest for GTS classes. Its first race was at the 24 Hours of Daytona and managed to finish 29th position, <b>but</b> <b>fortunately</b> the team would improve greatly, finishing 12th position in the 12 Hours of Sebring. The car wasn't able to reach much further however, which meant the team had to switch to GTS-2. Oreca had planned for racing in the 24 Hours of Le Mans with their own GTS-R.|$|E
25|$|In January 1807 Commander Thomas Thrush took {{command and}} sailed Avon to Jamaica on 16 April. (He had been {{appointed}} to her in September 1806 but had had to await her return.) During her time on the Jamaica station lightning struck Avon, damaging her badly, <b>but</b> <b>fortunately</b> causing no deaths. Thrush also {{had the opportunity to}} take Avon to Cartagena to pick up a freight of dollars; his commission on the transport when he delivered it to Britain was £2,056. On 1 May 1809 he was promoted to post-captain and removed to Garland.|$|E

25|$|Biloxi put to sea on 13 January and, {{after joining}} Task Group (TG) 53.5 in Hawaii, sailed for the Marshall Islands. In company with Louisville, Mobile, , and six destroyers, the light cruiser {{approached}} Wotje {{early in the}} morning on 30 January. After launching her Kingfisher spotter aircraft, she carried out a neutralizing bombardment of the Japanese air base on Wotje from dawn until noon. Enemy shore batteries fired back intermittently, one of which straddled Biloxi. A later ricochet hit the superstructure above the signal bridge <b>but</b> <b>fortunately</b> did not explode.|$|E
25|$|Vn.Shankar Narayan {{suggests}} that the origin of vegetarianism in India developed from the idea that balance needed to be restored. He claims, “Along with the development in civilisation, savagery also increased {{and those who were}} helpless and voiceless among both humans and non-human animals were more and more exploited and killed to satiate human needs and greed thus disturbing the balance of nature. <b>But</b> <b>fortunately,</b> there were many serious attempts to bring back the humanity to sanity and restore balance from time to time.” He also says that the idea of living in harmony with nature became central to the leaders.|$|E

60|$|That cut it short. They retired precipitately {{from the}} weather gangway abaft the main shrouds, and sought refuge in a sequestered nook near the companion-hatch, which was, in name {{as well as}} in every other way, much more suited to their circumstances.

25|$|Ferdinando, despite {{no longer}} being a cardinal, {{exercised}} much influence at successive Papal conclaves; elections which chose the Pope, {{the head of the}} Catholic Church. In 1605, Ferdinando succeeded in getting his candidate, Alessandro de' Medici, elected as Pope Leo XI. Leo XI died less than a month later, <b>but</b> <b>fortunately</b> for the Medici his successor Pope Paul V was also pro-Medici. Ferdinando's pro-Papal foreign policy, however, had drawbacks. Tuscany was overcome with religious orders, all of whom were not obliged to pay taxes. Ferdinando died in 1609, leaving an affluent realm; however, his inaction in international affairs drew Tuscany into the provincial yolk of politics.|$|E
25|$|The {{figure on}} the right shows an example. A {{boundary}} layer flow was created {{on both sides of}} a thin rigid flat plate which terminated with a square trailing edge. Note the nearly pure tone at 2000Hz with a Strouhal number of 0.21 protruding above the turbulent sound spectrum. Once again the magic number of Strouhal appears. The characteristic speed was the mean speed of the jet, U and the characteristic dimension was chosen as the trailing edge thickness t. The better characteristic dimension would have been the boundary layer thickness, <b>but</b> <b>fortunately</b> the two dimensions were almost the same. The measured sound field was clearly dipole-like (modified slightly by the plate presence).|$|E
25|$|Upon {{excitation}} of {{the sample}} with a radio frequency (60–1000MHz) pulse, a nuclear magnetic resonance response - a free induction decay (FID) - is obtained. It is a very weak signal, and requires sensitive radio receivers to pick up. A Fourier transform is carried out to extract the frequency-domain spectrum from the raw time-domain FID. A spectrum from a single FID has a low signal-to-noise ratio, <b>but</b> <b>fortunately</b> it improves readily with averaging of repeated acquisitions. Good 1H NMR spectra can be acquired with 16 repeats, which takes only minutes. However, for elements heavier than hydrogen, the relaxation time is rather long, e.g. around 8 seconds for 13C. Thus, acquisition of quantitative heavy-element spectra can be time-consuming, taking tens of minutes to hours.|$|E
