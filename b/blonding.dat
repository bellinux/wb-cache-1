5000|$|<b>Blond</b> (male), blonde (female), or fair hair, is a {{hair color}} {{characterized}} by {{low levels of}} the dark pigment eumelanin. The resultant visible hue depends on various factors, but always has some sort of yellowish color. The color can be from the very pale <b>blond</b> (caused by a patchy, scarce distribution of pigment) to reddish [...] "strawberry" [...] <b>blond</b> or golden-brownish ("sandy") <b>blond</b> colors (the latter with more eumelanin). On the Fischer-Saller scale, <b>blond</b> color ranges from A (light <b>blond)</b> to O (dark <b>blond).</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Blond</b> (or blonde for women) hair {{ranges from}} nearly white (platinum <b>blond,</b> tow-haired) {{to a dark}} golden blonde. Strawberry <b>blond,</b> a mixture of <b>blond</b> and red hair, is a much rarer type {{containing}} the most pheomelanin.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blond</b> hair {{can have}} almost any {{proportion}} of pheomelanin and eumelanin, but has only {{small amounts of}} both. More pheomelanin creates a more golden or strawberry <b>blond</b> color, and more eumelanin creates an ash or sandy <b>blond</b> color. Many children born with <b>blond</b> hair develop darker hair as they age, {{with the majority of}} natural <b>blonds</b> developing a hair color of a dark <b>blond</b> hue by the time they reach middle age. Pregnancy hormones hasten this process. Natural light <b>blond</b> hair is rare in adulthood, with claims of the world's population ranging from 2% naturally <b>blond</b> to 16 percent in the US. <b>Blond</b> hair is most commonly found in Northern and Western Europeans and their descendants but can be found spread around most of Europe. Studies in 2012 showed that naturally <b>blond</b> hair of Melanesians is caused by a recessive mutation in tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1). In the Solomon Islands, 26% of the population carry the gene; however, it is absent outside of Oceania.|$|R
50|$|Reported to {{have given}} the first chance to some 70 writers, <b>Blond</b> was {{particularly}} close to the novelist Simon Raven. <b>Blond</b> set up various publishing firms over the years, including <b>Blond</b> Educational in 1962, which he sold in 1969 to CBS, and he went into partnership with Desmond Briggs as <b>Blond</b> & Briggs in 1960, an informal arrangement that lasted until 1979 when Briggs retired and Harlech Television bought the company in 1979, retaining <b>Blond</b> as an advisor. In a management buyout <b>Blond</b> regained control after two years, and established his last partnership, <b>Blond,</b> Muller and White. Century Hutchinson absorbed this firm in 1987.|$|R

50|$|The Fischer-Saller scale, {{named after}} Eugen Fischer and , {{is used in}} {{physical}} anthropology and medicine to determine the shades of hair color. The scale uses the following designations: A (very light <b>blond),</b> B to E (light <b>blond),</b> F to L (<b>blond),</b> M to O (dark <b>blond),</b> P to T (light brown to brown), U to Y (dark brown/black) and Roman numerals I to IV (red) and V to VI (red <b>blond).</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Blond</b> hair is {{most common}} in light-skinned infants and children, {{so much so that}} the term [...] "baby blond" [...] is often used for very light colored hair. Babies may be born with <b>blond</b> hair even among groups where adults rarely have <b>blond</b> hair, {{although}} such natural hair usually falls out quickly. <b>Blond</b> hair tends to turn darker with age, and many children's <b>blond</b> hair turns light, medium, dark brown or black before or during their adult years.|$|R

50|$|<b>Blond</b> hair {{occurs in}} 10% of the {{population}} in the islands. After years of questions, studies have resulted in the better understanding of the <b>blond</b> gene. The findings show that the <b>blond</b> hair trait is due to an amino acid change of protein TYRP1. This accounts for the highest occurrence of <b>blond</b> hair outside of European influence in the world. While 10% of Solomon Island's people display the <b>blond</b> phenotype about 26% {{of the population}} carry the recessive trait for it as well.|$|R

40|$|Black blotching of {{the skin}} in red tilapia is {{undesired}} by tilapia producers since it affects their marketability. This study was carried out with the aims of mapping the <b>blond</b> locus and testing whether the homozygous recessive <b>blond</b> gene reduces or removes blotching in red tilapia by studying {{the interaction between the}} red and <b>blond</b> genes. Two types of mapping families (two intraspecific and one interspecific) were used for the mapping of the <b>blond</b> locus. Genome-wide mapping using microsatellites was first carried out to identify molecular markers that were linked to the <b>blond</b> locus. The locus was mapped in linkage group (LG) 5 in an interval that varied between 7. 5 and 20. 8 cM, depending on the tested family. In the intraspecific families the <b>blond</b> locus was closely linked to the microsatellites UNH 309, UNH 169 and GM 017 (P < 10 - 11), while in the interspecific family microsatellite GM 636 (P < 10 - 8) was also found to be significantly associated, in addition to the above three microsatellites. Linked markers were used to identify the genotype of individual fish for the <b>blond</b> and red loci from the specifically designed crosses so the effect of recessive <b>blond</b> gene on blotched fish could be assessed. The underlying <b>blond</b> trait did not significantly reduce the area of blotching but did reduce the saturation (paler blotching) and enhanced the redness of body colour in the homozygous <b>blond</b> fish compared to the heterozygous (wild type) group...|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{parameters}} {{were estimated}} for stillbirth, calving ease and gestation length in three endangered Austrian <b>blond</b> cattle breeds, Carinthian <b>Blond,</b> Murboden and Waldviertel <b>Blond.</b> REML analysis {{based on an}} animal model including direct and maternal genetic effects was applied. Direct heritability estimates for calving ease, stillbirth and gestation length varied from 0. 003 to 0. 111, 0. 006 to 0. 044 and 0. 235 to 0. 512, respectively, while maternal heritabilities ranged from 0. 001 to 0. 007 for calving ease, 0. 005 to 0. 014 for stillbirth, and 0. 002 to 0. 063 for gestation length. All pairwise genetic correlations for direct traits were generally moderate to high except for stillbirth-calving ease (− 0. 077, Carinthian <b>Blond).</b> The genetic correlations of all pairs of the 3 direct traits were positive for Murboden (0. 520 to 0. 700) and Waldviertel <b>Blond</b> (0. 253 to 0. 707) while negative genetic correlations were detected for Carinthian <b>Blond</b> (− 0. 077 to − 0. 943). Close positive genetic correlations were found between direct stillbirth and calving ease of Murboden (0. 700) and between direct calving ease and gestation length of Waldviertel <b>Blond</b> (0. 707), while a close negative genetic correlation was found between direct calving ease and gestation length of Carinthian <b>Blond</b> (− 0. 943) ...|$|R
