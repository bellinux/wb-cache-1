5000|$|Mercenaries in {{this setting}} are unique, because there is an {{international}} Mercenaries’ Guild, {{and part of the}} Code of the Mercenaries’ Guild is that both parties must follow a contract to the letter - if the person doing the hiring violates the contract, he or she is fined by the Guild, and cannot hire a <b>bonded</b> <b>Company</b> for a period of at least one year. If the hired Company violates the contract, the Guild takes it out of their hide and out of the bond they were paid by their employer, for the violation of contracted. Additionally, if a <b>bonded</b> <b>Company</b> or a <b>bonded</b> individual hired in a war surrenders, they are allowed to leave the zone of battle unmolested and report to a neutral zone, where they will “get ransomed,” by the Guild (meaning saved in some context), and this is stated as the reason that a bonded Mercenary (one who actually has a membership with the Mercenaries’ Guild) pays their dues. Additionally, as part of the Code, a <b>bonded</b> <b>Company</b> will not fight for a suicide cause, will not switch sides midway through a conflict, will not follow a mutiny against their employer, and will do all in their power to ensure safe extraction for that employer, if things “go south.” For this reason, <b>bonded</b> <b>Companies</b> are more expensive to hire than either a free-lance Company or spontaneously assembled <b>Company,</b> because <b>bonded</b> <b>Companies</b> are of a correspondingly higher caliber.|$|R
