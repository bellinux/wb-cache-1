40|$|The uplift {{response}} of symmetrical <b>anchor</b> <b>plates</b> {{with and without}} geogrid reinforcement layers has been evaluated in model tests and numerical simulations using PLAXIS. Many parameters of the reinforcement layers were used to reinforce the sandy soil over circular, square, and rectangular symmetrical <b>anchor</b> <b>plates</b> of various sizes. In the current research, different parameters, such as relative density of sand and embedment ratios, in conjunction with geogrid reinforcement layer parameters including size, number of layers, and {{the proximity of the}} layer to the circular <b>anchor</b> <b>plate,</b> were investigated in a scale model. The failure mechanism and the associated rupture surface were observed and evaluated. Test results showed that using geogrid reinforcement layers significantly improves the uplift capacity of symmetrical <b>anchor</b> <b>plates.</b> It was found that inclusion of one geogrid layer resting directly on top of the symmetrical <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> was more effective in enhancing the symmetrical anchor capacity than the layer itself. It was also found that the inclusion of one geogrid layer on the symmetrical <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> improved the uplift capacity more than the same symmetrical <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> embedded without a reinforcement layer. The single geogrid layer was also more effective in enhancing the uplift capacity compared to the multiple geogrid layer reinforcement approach. In general, the results show that the uplift capacity of symmetrical <b>anchor</b> <b>plates</b> in loose and dense sand can be significantly increased by the inclusion of geogrid layers. It was also observed that the inclusion of geogrid layers reduces the requirement for a higher L/D ratio to achieve the required uplift capacity.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of tie rod <b>anchor</b> <b>plates</b> is {{at present}} not well established, and the criteria suggested {{do not seem}} to have consistent theoretical basis. This paper suggests a theoretical approach to determine the load-carrying capacity of stiff <b>anchor</b> <b>plates</b> acting on a masonry wall. According to this approach the punching strength is the lower of two values. The first value follows from the hypothesis that collapse occurs because of the slippage of the units on the mortar bed, whereas the second comes from the alternative hypothesis that punching creates a solid consisting of a truncated cone in which the outer face is the surface of the <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> (units break whereas the mortar does not crumble). When doing so it is supposed that the <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> is so stiff that pressure it applies on the masonry wall is almost constant.

40|$|Background: The fixable suture <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> is a {{new device}} that has been {{designed}} {{with the intention of}} improving anchorage-to-bone strength during tendon-to-bone repair in patients with compromised bone quality. In this in vitro study we compare the load-to-failure and mode-of-failure results of a fixable suture <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> to that of other devices that are commonly used during rotator cuff repair surgery, including: a buttress <b>plate,</b> metal suture <b>anchors,</b> bioabsorbable suture anchors, and suture through simple tunnels without any augmenting device. We hypothesized that the fixable suture <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> would provide higher load-to-failure measurements compared to the other devices. Methods: Each device was implanted into solid rigid polyurethane foam blocks with densities representing varying degrees of osteoporosis, and then tested to failure. ANOVA and post-hoc analysis tests were used to determine statistical significance. Results: The average load to failure for the fixable suture <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> was significantly greater in low and medium density blocks compared to the other devices tested (p≤ 0. 01). The greatest difference in magnitude was seen in low density blocks (5 pcf), where the fixable suture <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> failed at 278 ± 53 N (mean ± standard deviation), about double the value of the next highest failure at 133 ± 11 N for the buttress plate.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study the load bearing {{capacity}} of <b>anchor</b> <b>plates,</b> used for anchorage to concrete located at nuclear facilities. Two different type of <b>anchor</b> <b>plates</b> were examined, which together constitute {{the majority of the}} <b>anchor</b> <b>plates</b> used at Forsmark nuclear facility in Sweden. The first is a cast-in-place <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> with headed studs and the second is a post-installed <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> which uses sleevetype expansion anchors. Hence, anchors with both a mechanical or a frictional interlock to the concrete were examined. The main analysis tool was the finite element method, through the use of the two commercially available software packages ABAQUS and ADINA and their non-linear material models for concrete and steel. As a first step, the numerical methods were verified against experimental results from the literature. However, these only concern single anchors. The results from the verifications were then used to build the finite element models of the <b>anchor</b> <b>plates.</b> These were then subjected to different load combinations with the purpose to find the ultimate load capacity. Failure loads from the finite element analyses were then compared to the corresponding loads calculated according to the new European technical specification SIS-CEN/TS 1992 - 4 (2009). Most of the failure loads from the numerical analyses were higher than the loads obtained from the technical specification, although in some cases the numerical results were lower than the technical specification value. However, many conservative assumptions regarding the finite element models were made, hence there might still be an overcapacity present. All analyses that underestimate the failure load were limited to large and slender <b>anchor</b> <b>plates,</b> which exhibit an extensive bending of the steel plate. The bending of the steel plate induce shear forces on the anchors, which leads to a lower tensile capacity. In design codes, which assume rigid steel plates, this phenomenon is neglected. The failure loads from all different load combinations analysed were then used to develop failure envelopes as a demonstration of a useful technique, which can be utilised in the design process of complex load cases...|$|R

This is an innovative system due to the special shape and the penetration into soils. Two sizes of irregular-shaped anchors, 159 and 297 mm, were used. The non-symmetry anchor employed in the system contributes to its good performance and high pullout load capacity.

An important innovation of this system is the installation method, where it does not require excavation and grouting. The main objective of this research is to validate the break-out factors and the ultimate uplift capacity load of the irregular-shaped anchor with the existing researches related to <b>anchor</b> <b>plates.</b> The experimental research was performed on the models in a chamber box. For the 159 mm-width irregular-shaped anchor, an embedment ratio L/D between 1 and 7 and for the 297 mm-width embedment ratio L/D between 1 and 4 were employed.

Two different sand layers were considered above the anchor with different combinations of their internal friction angles. For several embedment ratios (H/B), the variations of the pullout factors F-gamma and F-q due to the components of soil unit weight and surcharge, respectively, were computed as a function of H-dense/H for different cases; here, H and H-dense imply (1) the depth of the <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> from ground surface and (2) the thickness of the dense sand layer, respectively. The pullout resistance increased continuously with an increase in H-dense/H.

New specific solutions with only one headed anchor are investigated in this paper: a more classic solution made with a single stud welded in the centre of the steel plate, and a more innovative one made with a piece of an IPE profile, welded in the centre of the steel plate. An experimental campaign was carried out by adapting existing European protocols for the assessment of post-installed anchors under seismic action. Static tests, pulsating tension load tests and tests with constant tension load and varying crack width were carried out in unconfined condition and in cracked concrete under different load conditions. Capacity reduction after cyclic tests is evaluated and compared with Concrete Capacity Design method (CCD) to prove its applicability as design method to these innovative solutions...|$|R
