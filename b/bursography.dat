40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} trochanteric anatomy with {{magnetic resonance}} (MR) imaging, <b>bursography,</b> MR <b>bursography,</b> and anatomic analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: T 1 -weighted and fat-saturated T 2 -weighted (transverse, sagittal, coronal, and coronal oblique planes) MR imaging {{of the greater}} trochanter was performed in 10 cadaveric hips and 12 hips of asymptomatic volunteers. Three bursae comprising the trochanteric bursa complex were injected, and conventional radiography and MR imaging were performed. The specimens were sectioned for anatomic analysis, corresponding to the MR imaging planes. Tendon attachments and bursal localization {{were related to the}} facets of the greater trochanter. RESULTS: The bony surface of the greater trochanter consists of four facets: anterior, lateral, posterior, and superoposterior. The gluteus medius muscle attaches to the superoposterior and lateral facets. The gluteus minimus muscle attaches to the anterior facet. The trochanteric bursa covered the posterior facet and the lateral insertion of the gluteus medius muscle. The subgluteus medius bursa was located in the superior part of the lateral facet, underneath the gluteus medius tendon. The subgluteus minimus bursa lies {{in the area of the}} anterior facet, underneath the gluteus minimus tendon, medial and cranial to its insertion, and extends medially covering the distal anterior part of the hip joint capsule. The trochanteric bursa is delineated with fat on both sides and can be seen on transverse nonenhanced T 1 -weighted images as a fine line curving around the posterior part of the trochanter. CONCLUSION: MR imaging and <b>bursography</b> provide detailed information about the anatomy of tendinous attachments of the abductor muscles and the bursal complex of the greater trochanter...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT:Impingement of the {{rotator cuff}} be neath the coracoacromial arch without {{associated}} rup ture of the cuff or reactive bone {{changes on the}} under-surface of the acromion is a well established clinical diagnosis. The value of subacromial <b>bursography</b> {{in the assessment of}} this condition was investigated in an anatomical study of fifteen cadavera and a clinical study of thirty-one patients. The subacromial bursa is situated like a cap over the rotator cuff and can be demonstrated roentgeno-graphically by the injection of contrast material in shoulders from cadavera and living subjects. This bursa is composed of subacromial and subdeltoid portions as well as a subcoracoid extension in some in dividuals. However, it is the anterior portion of th...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{delineate}} the normal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging {{anatomy of the}} lesser metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints in a cadaveric model and compare the MR arthrographic and MR bursographic findings with the standard MR imaging findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: T 1 -weighted spin-echo MR imaging of 48 lesser MTP joints of 12 cadaveric feet was performed. The specimens were subsequently evaluated with MR arthrography, MR <b>bursography,</b> or both examinations. Musculoskeletal radiologists evaluated standard MR images to determine the normal appearances of the joint structures, especially the fibrous capsule, plantar plate, and collateral ligament complex (CLC). Signal intensity, morphology, joint thickness, relationships with adjacent structures, and best plane for analysis were analyzed. The contrast material-enhanced (ie, arthrographic and bursographic) MR imaging findings were compared with the standard MR imaging findings. RESULTS: The coronal plane was best for simultaneous depiction of the fibrous capsule, plantar plate, and collateral ligament complex and for assessment {{of the relationship between}} the CLC and the plantar plate. The sagittal plane was best for analysis of the bone attachments of the plantar plate and the transverse plane for evaluation of the CLC attachment sites in the phalanges. MR arthrography enabled identification of the bare areas and recesses of the joints, better delineation of the plantar plate articular surface, and better evaluation of the integrity of the soft-tissue components of the joints. Compared with the other examinations, MR <b>bursography</b> did not help improve these evaluations. CONCLUSION: MR imaging is an excellent examination for delineating the anatomy of the lesser MTP joints. Compared with standard MR imaging, only MR arthrography helps improve visualization of the fibrous capsule, plantar plate, and CLC of the lesser MTP joints...|$|E
