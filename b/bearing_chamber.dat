A flow rig that can accommodate various sump designs has been built. A new advanced sump has been built with features to address various issues with the old standard sump design.

One of the main task of the <b>bearing</b> <b>chambers</b> is, beside an efficient scavenging of the lubricating oil, the cooling of the hot compartments. A very complex two-phase air-oil flow takes usually place in these <b>bearing</b> <b>chambers</b> consisting of oil droplet-laden air flows and shear-driven liquid wall films. The interaction of the droplets with the wall films is significantly influencing the wall heat transfer and the cooling performance of these systems. For this reason, a detailed characterization and modelling of the mass and momentum exchange between droplets and wall films for the unique impingement parameter range in <b>bearing</b> <b>chambers</b> is inevitable. This scientific report investigates the oil droplet impact dynamics for typical impingement regimes relevant to aero-engine <b>bearing</b> <b>chambers.</b> The application of a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) technique based on the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method and coupled with a gradient-based adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique allowed to characterize the drop impact dynamics during various single micro- and millimeter drop impacts onto thin and thick films. With {{the help of a}} special numerical treatment, a self-perturbing mechanism is installed that leads to the correct resolution of the crown disintegration process. The numerical methodology was thoroughly validated using the experimental results of millimeter sized drop impacts onto deep liquid pools. These results were developed with an enhanced back-illuminated high-speed imaging and Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) technique.

A roller bearing consists of an inner race, an outer race and a cage constraining a number of rolling elements. In the aeroengine application, oil is introduced into the <b>bearing</b> <b>chamber</b> via the inner race regions of the bearing into the rolling elements interstices. This provides lubrication for the roller bearings. The source of heat in the <b>bearing</b> <b>chamber</b> is mainly from rolling contact friction and the high temperature of combustion.

40|$|In {{a typical}} aero engine <b>bearing</b> <b>chamber,</b> oil is {{introduced}} to lubricate and cool the bearings {{as well as}} the <b>bearing</b> <b>chamber</b> wall. The flow of the oil in the <b>bearing</b> <b>chamber</b> is very complex due to the presence of various forces: gravity, windage, capillary, etc. These pose a great challenge for designers, in particular on how to effectively and efficiently scavenge the hot oil out of the <b>bearing</b> <b>chamber.</b> The University of Nottingham Technology Centre in Gas Turbine Transmission Systems is conducting an ongoing experimental program on liquid and gas flow behavior in the highly rotating environment typically found in a <b>bearing</b> <b>chamber.</b> This paper presents results from a study of the thin film on the wall of a generic <b>bearing</b> <b>chamber</b> consisting of an inner rotating shaft and outer stationary cylindrical wall.

40|$|In aeroengines {{the shafts}} are {{supported}} on bearings that carry the radial and axial loads. A ball bearing {{is made up}} of an inner-race, an outer-race and a cage which contains the balls, these together comprise the bearing elements. The bearings require oil for lubrication and cooling. The design of the bearing studied in this work is such that the oil is fed to the bearing through holes/slots in the inner race. At each axial feed location the oil is fed through a number of equispaced feedholes/slots but there is a different number of holes at each location. Once the oil has passed through the bearing it sheds outwards from both sides into compartments known as the <b>bearing</b> <b>chambers.</b> A number of studies have been carried out on the dynamics of bearings. Most of the analyses consider the contributions of fluid forces as small relative to the interaction of the bearing elements. One of the most sophisticated models for a cage-raceway analysis is {{based on the work of}} Ashmore et al. [1], where the cage-raceway is considered to be a short journal bearing divided into sectors by the oil feeds. It is further assumed that the oil exits from the holes and forms a continuous block of oil that exits outwards on both sides of the cage-raceway. In the model, the Reynolds equation is used to estimate the oil dynamics. Of interest in this current work is the behaviour of the oil and air within the space bounded by the cage and inner race. The aim is to determine whether oil feed to the bearing can be modelled as coming from a continuous slot or if the discrete entry points must be modelled. A Volume of Fluid Computational Fluid Dynamics approach is applied. A sector of a ball bearing is modelled with a fine mesh and the detailed simulations show the flow behaviour for different oil splits to the three feed locations of the bearing thus providing information useful to understanding oil shedding into the <b>bearing</b> <b>chambers.</b> The work shows that different flow behaviour is predicted by models where the oil inlets through a continuous slot compared to discrete entry holes. The form and speed of oil shedding from the bearing is found to depend strongly on shaft speed with the shedding speed being slightly higher than the cage linear speed. The break-up pattern of oil on the cage inner surface suggests smaller droplets will be shed at higher shaft speed...|$|R

40|$|Thin-film flows {{encountered}} in engineering {{systems such as}} aero-engine <b>bearing</b> <b>chambers</b> often exhibit capillary waves and occur within a moderate to high Weber number range. Although the depth-averaged simulation of these thin-film flows is computationally efficient relative to traditional volume-of-fluid (VOF) methods, numerical challenges remain particularly for solutions involving capillary waves and in the higher Weber number, low surface tension range. A depth-averaged approximation of the Navier–Stokes equations {{has been used to}} explore the effect of surface tension, grid resolution, and inertia on thin-film rimming solution accuracy and numerical stability. In shock and pooling solutions where capillary ripples are present, solution stability, and accuracy are shown to be highly sensitive to surface tension. The common practice in analytical studies of enforcing unphysical low Weber number stability constraints is shown to stabilize the solution by artificially damping capillary oscillations. This approach, however, although providing stable solutions is shown to adversely affect solution accuracy. An alternative grid resolution-based stability criterion is demonstrated and used to obtain numerically stable shock and pooling solutions without recourse to unphysical surface tension values. This allows for the accurate simulation of thin-film flows with capillary waves within the constrained parameter space corresponding to physical material and flow properties.

40|$|An aero-engine <b>bearing</b> <b>chamber</b> is a {{structure}} {{that is used to}} contain and collect oil used in lubricating and cooling the bearings supporting the high-speed engine shafts. There are various bearings in an aero-engine. Within the bearing chambers, there are typically the bearings, rotating shafts, seals and gears (in some designs). The walls of the <b>bearing</b> <b>chamber</b> are stationary and there are vents and sumps to take out the oil, via an offtake pipe, and the sealing air. The oil collected via the sump and vents is recycled and used again in the loop. To prevent oil degradation and reduce chance of coking in the chamber, it is desired that all of the oil goes through the recycling loop, with no oil staying longer than necessary in the chamber. The sealing air is used to maintain a positive pressure to keep the oil within the chamber. The flow inside a <b>bearing</b> <b>chamber</b> is highly turbulent and consists of a rotating mixture of oil and air. A smaller amount of the oil, mostly as oil-droplets, exits at the vents and is separated from the air using de-aerators [1]. It is expected that by gravity, most of the oil collects at the sump and can be easily scavenged. This is provided the sump can be large enough. The geometry of a <b>bearing</b> <b>chamber</b> is, however, complex largely because of space limitations. It is very important that oil is not resident longer than necessary to prevent over-heating and therefore deterioration or coking. Experimental observations by Chandra & Simmons [2], have shown that bearing chambers with deep sumps perform better that those with shallow sumps. Since shallow sumps are inevitable, a number of innovative studies have been done to improve <b>bearing</b> <b>chamber</b> designs. The presence of air in the oil (e. g. as bubbles) reduces the efficiency of the scavenging pump. Other factors such as oil momentum and windage can take oil away from the off-take pipe potentially increasing oil residence volume. Chandra & Simmons [2] placed inserts such as grille cover, perforated plate, etc, on a side of the bearing wall and improvements in the residence volume were seen. In this work, we are looking at a detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of one of the inserts that performed well.

40|$|A droplet to film {{interaction}} modelling Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{technique is}} presented in this work. The eventual target application is an aeroengine <b>bearing</b> <b>chamber</b> where oil is used to lubricate and cool the bearings and the <b>bearing</b> <b>chamber</b> walls. Inside the chamber, the oil is found as jets/filaments, film and as droplets in the highly rotational environment. Of particular interest in this work is {{the formation of the}} continuous film from the droplets. Spray-film is another relevant application with droplets forming film as it cools the wall. In this work, the liquid and gas continua are modelled using an enhanced Volume of Fluid (VoF) technique. The droplets in the core-air are tracked using a Lagrangian framework that treats them as discrete particles and are coupled to the Eulerian VoF film upon impact using source terms. In finite volume CFD techniques, a prohibitively large number of computational cells would be required to describe, in details, the droplet-film impact phenomenon. The proposal here is that finer mesh, sufficient to capture the film physics, is used only close to walls or where film is expected to form. Simple droplet train to complex spray-film setups are used to verify and validate for mass, momentum and energy transfer. The technique was also applied to experimental rigs representative of aeroengine bearing chambers; and as with every CFD problems, the choice of boundary conditions determines the final output. A parametric study of the <b>bearing</b> <b>chamber</b> flows shows that film thickness increases with flow rate. The film thickness increases with a reducing shaft speed for same flow rate. The heat transfer coefficient results show that higher flow rates provide better heat transfer at higher shaft speeds...|$|E
40|$|Aeroengine <b>bearing</b> <b>chambers</b> are geometrically complex, {{typically}} containing shafts, bearings, {{seals and}} stationary components. Oil is supplied for lubrication and cooling {{and so the}} chamber contains a highly rotating two-phase (oil/air) flow where the oil is typically present as droplets, ligaments, mist and films. These films may be thick or thin and film speed varies with chamber location. It is desirable to know a priori {{the outcome of a}} droplet-film impact event in terms of mass, momentum and energy transfer. There is a significant body of research on the interaction between droplets and static films. The experimental parameter space has been characterised on the basis of film thickness and impact parameter to predict the outcome of an impingement. The impingement of droplets on moving films has only begun to be investigated over the last decade and consequently models have not yet been developed and the parameter space has barely begun to be characterised. Within this paper results are presented from an experimental study in which water droplets of 3 mm and 3. 8 mm at 20 °C falling under the influence of gravity impinged onto water films flowing down an inclined plane. Film temperature was 30 °C and film thicknesses were between 2. 3 mm and 4. 2 mm. High speed imaging was used to determine the impingement outcomes and cavity morphology. A high speed infrared camera was used {{to determine the extent of}} the thermally affected region and its temperature behaviour. We find that by using the resultant droplet velocity (combining droplet and film velocities) the film impingement outcomes can be characterised into regions very similar to those for static films. The data is presented as a function of splashing parameter and non-dimensional film thickness. It was observed that for these impacts on supercritical films (Fr > 1) there is less propensity for secondary droplet formation through jet breakup than on static and subcritical films (Fr < 1). Data was obtained for extent of the thermally affected region. It was found that the cooler droplet liquid spreads over the inside of the crater before heating up to film temperature. Development of crater shape and size was also studied and data compared to established models for droplet impact on deep static films. During the initial stages of an impact crater area increases similarly to that for static films although the crater shape itself is less similar and is asymmetrical due to the film motion...|$|R
