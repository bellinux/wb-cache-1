5|$|While MacDougall {{believed}} {{the results from}} his experiment showed the human soul might have weight, his report, which was not published until 1907, stated the experiment would have to <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> many times before any conclusion could be obtained.|$|E
5|$|As {{the morning}} progressed {{and the light}} changed he would switch to {{sequentially}} later canvas settings, sometimes working on as many as ten or twelve paintings a day, each one depicting a slightly different aspect of light. The process would <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> {{over the course of}} days, weeks, or months, depending on the weather and the progress of the paintings until they were completed. As the seasons changed the process was renewed.|$|E
5|$|Dr. No also {{establishes}} the oft-repeated association (in this case, Project Mercury) between the Bond series and the US manned space programme—which would <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> with Project Gemini in You Only Live Twice, Project Apollo in Diamonds Are Forever, {{and the space}} shuttle in Moonraker (not to mention several outer space sequences involving fictional satellite programmes in GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, and Die Another Day).|$|E
25|$|Reduplication can be full (the entire word <b>is</b> <b>repeated),</b> monosyllabic (only one {{syllable}} of {{the word}} <b>is</b> <b>repeated),</b> or bisyllabic (two syllables {{of the word}} <b>are</b> <b>repeated).</b>|$|R
50|$|Eldorado <b>was</b> <b>repeated</b> on UK Gold between 1995 and 1996. It <b>was</b> <b>repeated</b> {{again in}} 2002, and has {{occasionally}} <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> in late night slots since then.|$|R

5|$|During the Middle Ages, {{the monastic}} traditions of both Western and Eastern Christianity moved beyond vocal prayer to Christian meditation. These progressions {{resulted}} in two distinct and different meditative practices: Lectio Divina in the West and hesychasm in the East. Hesychasm involves {{the repetition of}} the Jesus Prayer, but Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages at different times and although a passage may <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 the {{guidelines}} were changed to allow individual conventions to create additional categories, which was codified as {{up to two}} categories for that year. These additional awards were officially designated as Hugo Awards, but {{were not required to}} <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> by future conventions. This was later adjusted to only allow one additional category; while these extra Hugo Awards have been given out in several categories, only a few were ever awarded for more than one year.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in September 1954. No alpha decay was seen from mendelevium atoms; thus, Ghiorso suggested that the mendelevium had all decayed by electron capture to fermium and that the experiment should <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> to search instead for spontaneous fission events. The repetition of the experiment happened in February 1955.|$|E
5000|$|The {{series has}} not <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> on Australian {{television}} {{since the early}} 1980s. (The UK original Are You Being Served? had <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> by ABC Television in Australia several times. By 1978 it had <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> by Channel Seven in Australia to even larger audiences.) ...|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{the last}} two lines of every verse <b>were</b> <b>repeated.</b> It <b>was</b> later changed so that only the last line <b>is</b> <b>repeated.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Although {{originally}} {{made for}} the BBC the series has subsequently <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> on ITV3. The show has also <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> on Gold, Drama and Yesterday.|$|R
5|$|Operations Southeast Croatia and Ozren were early {{opportunities}} for the Germans to learn lessons about the challenges their poorly equipped and often substandard occupation troops faced fighting in the difficult terrain and weather conditions of Bosnia. However, these lessons were to <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> many more times in the following years as German commanders persisted with their encirclement tactics and unreasonable expectations {{of what could be}} achieved in a given time and space.|$|E
5|$|The Siamese {{success at}} {{repelling}} the Burmese would not <b>be</b> <b>repeated.</b> This first ever invasion gave the Burmese an important experience on fighting with Siamese. The next invasion would {{be conducted by}} Bayinnaung, a man accustomed to fighting against Siamese soldiers and familiar with marching through Siamese terrain. The unrest in Burma delayed that next invasion for fifteen years, until the War of 1563 or the War of the White Elephants.|$|E
5|$|The call of {{the great}} spotted {{woodpecker}} is a sharp kik, which may <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> as a wooden rattling krrarraarr if the bird is disturbed. The courtship call, gwig, is mostly given in the display flight. The great spotted woodpecker drums on dead trees and branches, and sometimes suitable man-made structures, to maintain contact between paired adults and to advertise ownership of territory.|$|E
50|$|NOTE: Since its {{original}} broadcast, Series 1 has not <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> since. Series 2 and 3 have <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> {{on and off}} occasions since February 2007 on the CITV channel. Series 1 has <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> (in a single, omnibus, edition) by STV and as a Christmas 'special' on STV Glasgow in 2014 and 2015.|$|R
30|$|The {{circularity}} {{may have}} a different form, namely that all steps <b>are</b> <b>repeated</b> many times, or steps 4 to 6 <b>are</b> <b>repeated</b> in a circular way.|$|R
50|$|Episodes 1-5 <b>were</b> <b>repeated</b> on BBC1 on Thursdays from 26 June to 24 July 1986. Episode 6 <b>was</b> <b>repeated</b> on BBC2 on Thursday 31 July 1986.|$|R
5|$|The {{game was}} a rematch {{of an early}} regular-season contest, but even though Georgia Tech won that game, there were {{questions}} about whether the victory would <b>be</b> <b>repeated.</b> Twice before, the two teams matched in the ACC Championship Game had played earlier that season. Both times, the loser of the first matchup won the second. There also were questions about each team's quality because of their losses in rivalry games against Southeastern Conference foes.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} can <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> if necessary, {{but this}} is generally taken as a clue that additional treatments {{may be required to}} control the symptoms and preserve vision. Repeated lumbar punctures are regarded as unpleasant by patients, and they present a danger of introducing spinal infections if done too often. Repeated lumbar punctures are sometimes needed to control the ICP urgently if the patient's vision deteriorates rapidly.|$|E
5|$|While chrism is {{used only}} for the three sacraments that cannot <b>be</b> <b>repeated,</b> a {{different}} oil is used by a priest or bishop to bless a Catholic who, because of illness or old age, {{has begun to be}} in danger of death. This sacrament, known as Anointing of the Sick, is believed to give comfort, peace, courage and, if the sick person is unable to make a confession, even forgiveness of sins.|$|E
50|$|Hippies {{has never}} <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> on any {{terrestrial}} BBC channels, {{although it has}} <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> on Paramount Comedy 2, the now defunct Play UK, and Gold.|$|R
50|$|With new {{estimates}} for ai and the θis, the expectation step <b>is</b> <b>repeated</b> to recompute new membership values. The entire procedure <b>is</b> <b>repeated</b> until model parameters converge.|$|R
5000|$|There <b>are</b> two {{different}} <b>repeat</b> modes. In the single block repeat mode, the previous block <b>is</b> <b>repeated</b> a specified number of times. In the two block repeat mode, {{the previous two}} blocks <b>are</b> <b>repeated</b> a specified number of times.|$|R
5|$|While {{the area}} around Bath and the Bay of Quinte would remain a major {{agricultural}} region, the pattern of redirecting Kingston-Toronto traffic further inland which started with construction of the Kingston Road (1817) would <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> with the Grand Trunk Railway (1856) and ultimately Highway401 (1964).|$|E
5|$|A Jack Russell named Bothy {{made history}} in 1982 {{as part of}} the Transglobe Expedition. Owned by explorers Ranulph and Ginny Fiennes, he became the first dog to travel to both the north and south poles. This feat is {{unlikely}} to <b>be</b> <b>repeated,</b> as all dogs have been banned from Antarctica by the Antarctic Treaty nations since 1994, due to fears that they could transmit diseases to the native seal population. Ranulph Fiennes and Charles Burton actually made the trip to the north pole by powered sledges before signalling to the base camp that they had arrived. To celebrate their achievement, a plane was sent out to take the two men champagne, along with Bothy.|$|E
5|$|A second method {{involves}} artificially inseminating {{an elephant}} egg cell with sperm cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring {{would be an}} elephant–mammoth hybrid, and the process would have to <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> so more hybrids {{could be used in}} breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a hindrance to this method. In one case, an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects at less than two weeks old.|$|E
50|$|Series 1 <b>was</b> <b>repeated</b> on ITV on Friday afternoons, commencing 8 September 1978; series 2 <b>was</b> <b>repeated</b> on Friday afternoons, commencing 7 December 1979, {{and running}} into January 1980.|$|R
50|$|The {{series has}} since <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> on {{neighbouring}} ITV station, ITV Border and Sky3. In 2016, it <b>was</b> <b>repeated</b> on STV's local TV stations, STV Edinburgh and STV Glasgow.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, {{the show}} <b>was</b> <b>repeated</b> {{for the first}} time on the CITV channel since 2003. It <b>was</b> <b>repeated</b> for a one-off repeat one day in the Easter {{holidays}} (as an 'Easter Surprise!'). Then in the summer holidays from late July to the end of August. Over a year later in December 2008, it <b>was</b> <b>repeated</b> again throughout the Christmas holidays till January 2009.|$|R
5|$|After Hōshō was commissioned, {{experienced}} aircrews requested changes, and {{the ship}} was modified by the Yokosuka Navy Arsenal from 6 June to 20 August 1924. The island, tripod mast, and aircraft crane were removed since they partially obstructed the flight deck and obscured pilot visibility. The forward part of the flight deck was made horizontal, and the 8cm AA guns were moved forward, close {{to the position of}} the former island and {{out of the way of}} landing operations. After the island was removed, the carrier's flight operations were controlled from a platform extending from the side of the flight deck, a design that would <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> in subsequent Japanese aircraft carriers. The ship was then assigned to the 1st Fleet until 15 November 1924.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{critical}} buzz surrounding the show, BBC1 Controller, Michael Grade, quickly announced that the series would <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> on BBC1, stating, “I think it will reach a wider audience and it deserves it”, and so Edge of Darkness was duly shown, in double episodes, over three consecutive nights between 19 December and 21 December 1985, the fastest time between original broadcast and repeat in the BBC's history. These repeats were accompanied by a disclaimer that the GAIA organisation depicted in the programme was not connected with the Gaia publishing company supported by Prince Philip. It was a move that paid off – Edge of Darkness doubled its audience on BBC1 to 8 million viewers.|$|E
5|$|Blood free {{thyroxine}} and TSH {{levels are}} monitored {{to help determine}} whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4–8 weeks {{after the start of}} treatment or a change in levothyroxine dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the tests can <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> after 6 and then 12 months, unless there is a change in symptoms. In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level. Levothyroxine is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food, as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine. There is no direct way of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland.|$|E
50|$|In 2010 TV3 {{started to}} repeat its morning and daytime shows to the channel as <b>repeats.</b> Ireland AM <b>is</b> <b>repeated</b> on 3e each morning at 10:15, The Morning Show <b>is</b> <b>repeated</b> the {{following}} morning on 3e at 09:25 and Midday <b>is</b> <b>repeated</b> {{the following morning}} on 3e at 08:35.
