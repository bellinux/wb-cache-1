40|$|An {{evidence-based}} {{reassessment of}} the phylogenetic relationships of conodonts {{shows that they}} are not “stem” gnathostomes, nor vertebrates, and not even craniates. A significant group of conodont workers have proposed or accepted a craniate designation for the conodont animal, an interpretation that is increasingly becoming established as accepted “fact”. Against this prevailing trend, our conclusion is based on a revised analysis of traditional morphological features of both discrete conodont elements and apparatuses, histological investigation and a revised cladistic analysis modifying that used in the keystone publication promoted as proof of the hypothesis that conodonts are vertebrates. Our study suggests that conodonts possibly were not even chordates but demonstration of this {{is beyond the scope of}} this paper. To summarize, in conodonts there is low cephalization; presence of simple V-shaped trunk musculature and unique large-crystal albid material in the elements; lack of a dermal skeleton including characteristic vertebrate hard tissues of bone, dentine and enamel; lack of odontodes with <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> and a unique pulp system; lack of segmentally-arranged paraxial elements and dermal elements in median fins, all of which supports neither a vertebrate nor a craniate relationship for conodonts...|$|E
40|$|The {{numerous}} cushion-shaped tooth-bearing plates {{attributed to}} the stem-group osteichthyan Lophosteus superbus, which are argued here to represent the ancient form of inner dental arcade, display a unique and presumably primitive way of tooth shedding by basal hard tissue resorption. They carry regularly spaced, recumbent, gently recurved teeth arranged in transverse tooth files that diverge towards the lingual margin of the cushion. Three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction from propagation phase contrast synchrotron microtomography (PPC-SRμCT) reveals remnants of the first-generation teeth embedded in the basal plate {{that have never been}} discerned in any taxa. These teeth were shed by semi-basal resorption with the periphery of their bases retained as dentine rings. The rings are highly overlapped, which evidences tooth shedding prior to adding the next first-generation tooth. Later teeth at the same sites underwent cyclical replacing and shedding through basal resorption, producing stacks of buried resorption surfaces separated by <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment.</b> The number and spatial arrangement of resorption surfaces elucidates that basal resorption of replacement teeth had taken place at the older tooth sites before the addition of the youngest first-generation teeth at the lingual margin. Thus the replacement tooth buds cannot have been generated by a single permanent dental lamina, but must have arisen either from successional dental laminae associated with the predecessor teeth, or directly from the dental epithelium of these teeth. The virtual histological dissection of these Late Silurian microfossils broadens our understanding of the development of the gnathostome dental systems and the acquisition of the osteichthyan-type of tooth replacement. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} and function of the pharyngeal jaw apparatus (PJA) and postpharyngeal alimentary tract of Arrhamphus sclerolepis krefftii, an herbivorous hemiramphid, were investigated by dissection, light and scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray analysis of live specimens. A simple model of PJA operation is proposed, consisting of an adductive power stroke of the third pharyngobranchial that draws it posteriorly while the fifth ceratobranchial is adducted, and a return stroke in which the third pharyngobranchial bone is drawn anteriorly during abduction of the fifth ceratobranchial. Teeth in the posteromedial region of the PJA are eroded into an occlusion zone where {{the teeth of the}} third pharyngobranchial are spatulate incisiform and face posteriorly in opposition to the rostrally oriented spatulate incisiform teeth in the wear zone of the fifth ceratobranchial. The shape of the teeth and their pedestals (<b>bone</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment)</b> is consistent with the model and with the forces likely to operate on the elements of the PJA during mastication. The role of pharyngeal tooth replacement in maintaining the occlusal surfaces in the PJA during growth is described. The postpharyngeal alimentary tract of A. sclerolepis krefftii comprises a stomachless cylinder that attenuates gradually as it passes straight to the anus, interrupted only by a rectal valve. The ratio of gut length to standard length is about 0. 5. Despite superficial similarities to the cichlid PJA (Stiassny and Jensen [1987] Bull Mus Comp Zool 151 : 269 - 319), the hemiramphid PJA differs in the fusion of the third pharyngobranchial bones, teeth in the second pharyngobranchials and the fifth ceratobranchial face anteriorly, the presence of a slide-like diarthroses between the heads of the fourth epibranchials and the third pharyngobranchial, the occlusion zone of constantly wearing teeth, and the unusual form of the muscularis craniopharyngobranchialis. The functional relationship between these structures is explained and the consequence for the fish of a complex PJA and a simple gut is discussed. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E

50|$|The first {{evidence}} of periodontal disease damage becomes apparent in radiographs as the crestal <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> the jaw begins to become blunted, slanted, or scooped out in appearance. This destruction occurs {{as a result}} of the effect of bacterial endotoxins on bone tissue. Because the bone is alive, it contains cells in it that build bone, known as osteoblasts, and cells that break down bone, called osteoclasts. Usually these work at the same speed and keep each other in balance. In periodontitis, however, the chemical mediators, or by-products, of chronic inflammation stimulate the osteoclasts, causing them to work more rapidly than the cells that build bone. The net result is that bone is lost, and the loss <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> and <b>attachment</b> tissues is called periodontal disease.|$|R
25|$|This {{theory is}} based on the fact that, during galloping, the absence <b>of</b> any <b>bone</b> <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> the forelegs to the spine in the horse causes the {{shoulder}} to compress the cranial rib cage. The compression of the chest initiates a pressure wave of compression and expansion which spreads outwards. However, due to the shape of the lung and reflections off the chest wall, the wave of expansion and compression becomes focussed and amplified in the dorso-caudal lung. The alternate expansion and compression at the microscopic level in adjacent areas of lung tissue creates shear stress and capillary disruption. The theory predicts that hemorrhage would be more severe on hard track surfaces, but it does not explain why EIPH can occur in horses during swimming exercise.|$|R

Trypsin was therefore added to four groups <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> cells with addition of TGF-β 3, HCl, HCl/BSA solutions and additional flask as control.

40|$|Background: In frontotemporal decompressive {{craniectomy}} {{and subsequent}} cranioplasty, temporal muscle damage is frequently observed {{as a result}} of surgical manipulation, lack <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> <b>attachment,</b> and prolonged muscle inactivity. We investigated the use of a double dural patch in decompressive craniectomy to favor the safe surgical dissection of the temporal muscle in the subsequent cranioplasty and reduce temporal muscle damage. Methods: In 11 patients submitted to a decompressive craniectomy and duraplasty, a second (external) dural sheet was positioned to separate the inner dural patch from the temporal muscle. Results: When bone repositioning was performed, the detachment of the deep temporal muscle surface, covered by the external dural sheet, was easy and fast, with reduced blood loss. All the muscle fibers were preserved. Conclusion: The technique described in this article reduces the damage to the temporal muscle and can improve the functional and cosmetic results after decompressive craniectomy and cranioplasty. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The most widely used method of mobility assessment is to tap the tooth between two extreme positions. The study was designed to evaluate the association of Periotest values (PTV) with the amount <b>of</b> <b>bone,</b> clinical <b>attachment</b> loss, and various clinical indices. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the association between bone loss and Periotest values. Also we evaluated the effects <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> loss and tooth position on the Periotest values. Materials and Methods: A total number of 60 patients between the age group of 18 and 55 years were divided into subjects with healthy periodontium (Group A), and those with Chronic Generalized Periodontitis (Group B), having a generalized pocket probing depth of 3 - 8 mm, respectively. With the help of the Periotest, Florida probe, and radiographs the assessment was carried out. The data was statistically analyzed using the Student′s unpaired t-test. Results: It was found that the values were highly significant in the incisor, premolar, and molar areas. However, the value was found to be insignificant in the canine region. The anterior teeth showed higher PTV compared to the posterior teeth; and the mandibular teeth showed higher PTV compared to the maxillary teeth.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this paper is: (a) to present a rating scale {{for the evaluation of}} the musculoskeletal stress markers; (b) to analyze the medieval population from Cedynia in terms of the degree of expression and frequency of the musculoskeletal stress markers. The presented rating scale was developed based on the variability of the morphology <b>of</b> muscle <b>attachment</b> sites, observed in the skeletal material from Cedynia (102 males and 99 females). The scale encompasses 10 musculoskeletal stress markers located on the scapula, humerus, radius, femur and tibia. The system reflects three degrees (1, 2, 3) of complexity <b>of</b> the muscle <b>attachment</b> sites morphology. The analysis of asymmetry and sexual dimorphism of the musculoskeletal stress markers was made based on the c² (Pearson) statistics or c² statistics for 2 ´ 2 tables. Moderate degree (2) <b>of</b> muscle <b>attachment</b> site complexity is the most frequent degree of musculoskeletal stress markers development in the population from Cedynia. Low (1) and high (3) complexity <b>of</b> muscle <b>attachment</b> site are the most seldom observed categories. No statistically significant differences between the frequencies of the musculoskeletal stress markers on the <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> the right and left side of the skeleton were noted in females. Also in males the differences found were not statistically significant.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{delineate}} the normal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging {{anatomy of the}} lesser metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints in a cadaveric model and compare the MR arthrographic and MR bursographic findings with the standard MR imaging findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: T 1 -weighted spin-echo MR imaging of 48 lesser MTP joints of 12 cadaveric feet was performed. The specimens were subsequently evaluated with MR arthrography, MR bursography, or both examinations. Musculoskeletal radiologists evaluated standard MR images to determine the normal appearances of the joint structures, especially the fibrous capsule, plantar plate, and collateral ligament complex (CLC). Signal intensity, morphology, joint thickness, relationships with adjacent structures, and best plane for analysis were analyzed. The contrast material-enhanced (ie, arthrographic and bursographic) MR imaging findings were compared with the standard MR imaging findings. RESULTS: The coronal plane was best for simultaneous depiction of the fibrous capsule, plantar plate, and collateral ligament complex and for assessment {{of the relationship between}} the CLC and the plantar plate. The sagittal plane was best for analysis <b>of</b> the <b>bone</b> <b>attachments</b> <b>of</b> the plantar plate and the transverse plane for evaluation <b>of</b> the CLC <b>attachment</b> sites in the phalanges. MR arthrography enabled identification of the bare areas and recesses of the joints, better delineation of the plantar plate articular surface, and better evaluation of the integrity of the soft-tissue components of the joints. Compared with the other examinations, MR bursography did not help improve these evaluations. CONCLUSION: MR imaging is an excellent examination for delineating the anatomy of the lesser MTP joints.
