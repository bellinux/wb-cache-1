The starting order for Leg 1 was [...] "Priority 1" [...] (P1) and P2 WRC drivers in the order of the final classification of the 2006 season, followed by all other drivers as decided by the ACM. Loeb, the previous season's champion, set off first, followed by Grönholm, then Mikko Hirvonen. Loeb and Grönholm were the favourites to win; Loeb had won the Monte Carlo three times in a row between 2003 and 2005, and Grönholm had won in 2006. Nevertheless, there were worries that Loeb would not be physically fit enough to win. Four months earlier he had broken his left shoulder in a mountain-biking accident, and there was a chance he might not even compete {{in the first part of}} the season.

This loan was provided by three New York hedge funds: Citadel, Och-Ziff Capital Management and Perry Capital. The total amount was £660million, on which interest payments came to £62million a year. The club stated, [...] "The value of Manchester United has increased in the last year, which is why lenders want to invest in the club... This move represents good housekeeping and it ensures that Sir Alex Ferguson will be provided with sufficient funds to compete in the transfer market." [...] The Manchester United Supporters Trust responded, [...] "'The amount of money needed to be repaid overall is huge... The interest payment is one thing <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> the actual £660million? It is difficult to see how these sums can be reached without significant increases in ticket prices, which, as we always suspected, means the fans will effectively be paying for someone to borrow money to own their club." [...] Under the terms of the Glazers' refinancing, as they were unable to repay bondholders by 16 August 2010, the overall interest rate on the loans rose from 14.25% to 16.25%, resulting in annual payments of around £38million.|$|E

2500|$|Whether {{the company}} had done work on land owned by the federal {{government}} was a critical issue, because in 1930 the Supreme Court had held in Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook, 281 U.S. 647 (1930), that private personal property on federal land cannot be taxed by the state. Citing numerous Court precedents, Hughes noted that title to the river bed lay with the state even though the Constitution granted the federal government the power to use the river bed [...] "for any structure which the interest of navigation, in its judgment, may require." [...] <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> the land adjacent to the river bed which had been acquired {{by the federal government}}? Article 1, Section 8, Clause 17 of the U.S. Constitution gave Congress exclusive legislation power over such places so long as the state legislature concurred. Hughes, however, noted that the state had not granted exclusive jurisdiction to the federal government. Clause 17 also required that the construction on [...] "exclusive" [...] land be [...] "needful buildings". [...] Were dams and locks needful buildings? [...] Hughes concluded they were, citing several lower court rulings as well as the West Virginia law allowing the United States to purchase the land. [...] The defendant had argued that West Virginia had ceded exclusive jurisdiction to the federal government, but in a lengthy review of the legislative language Hughes argued for an interpretation which found that only concurrent jurisdiction had been granted. As to private property leased by the company in order to carry out its federal contract, Hughes perfunctorily dismissed any challenge to the jurisdiction of the state over this area.|$|E
