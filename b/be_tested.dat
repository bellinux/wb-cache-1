5|$|Because {{there would}} be only one chance {{to carry out the}} test correctly, Bainbridge decided that a {{rehearsal}} should be carried out to allow the plans and procedures to be verified, and the instrumentation to <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> and calibrated.

It was the first supernova to be detected through its neutrino emission {{and the first to}} be observed across every band of the electromagnetic spectrum. The relative proximity of this supernova has allowed detailed observation, and it provided the first opportunity for modern theories of supernova formation to <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> against observations.|$|E
