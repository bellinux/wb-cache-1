50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> was {{introduced}} by M. M. Kessler of MIT in a paper published in 1963, and has been embraced {{in the work of}} the information scientist Eugene Garfield. It is one of the earliest citation analysis methods for document similarity computation and some have questioned its usefulness, pointing out that two works may reference completely unrelated subject matter in the third. Furthermore, <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> is a retrospective similarity measure, meaning the information used to establish the similarity relationship between documents lies in the past and is static, i.e. <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> strength cannot change over time, since outgoing citation counts are fixed.|$|E
40|$|A Renovação Carismática Católica tem uma presença marcante no catolicismo brasileiro durante o século XX. Trata-se de um movimento eclesial que provocou diversos desdobramentos na configuração do catolicismo depois do Concílio Vaticano II. A RCC se tornou espaço de elaboração e de encontro da identidade religiosa para muitos católicos. Esta pesquisa procura entender como se processou esse fenômeno a partir do conceito tipológico de Convertido proposto por Danièle Hervieu-Léger. Neste percurso abordam-se questões concernentes à RCC, passando pelo seu embate inicial com a pluralidade do catolicismo transformador esboçado pelas CEBs, além do catolicismo institucional, e com o catolicismo devocional muito forte no Brasil, pelo seu surgimento e expansão, com destaque para a significação do advento das Novas Comunidades no {{interior}} da RCC, bem como da relação entre as características de elaboração da identidade religiosa, cultivada na RCC e a modernidade. A metodologia usada é preponderantemente bibliográfica, conjugada com o manuseio de questionários que foram aplicados entre membros da RCC. The Catholic Charismatic Renewal has {{an outstanding}} {{presence in the}} Brazilian Catholicism during the century XX. It is an ecclesial movement that led to several deployments in {{the configuration of the}} Catholicism after the Council Vatican II. RCC became elaboration space and of encounter of the religious identity for many Catholic. This research seeks to understand how this phenomenon takes place from the typological concept of "Convert" proposed by Danièle Hervieu-Léger. In this course concerning subjects are approached RCC, going by his/her initial shock with the plurality of the Catholicism transformer sketched by CEBs, besides the institutional Catholicism, and with the Catholicism very strong devocional in Brazil, for his/her appearance and expansion, with prominence for the significance of the coming of the New Communities inside RCC, {{as well as of the}} relationship among the characteristics of elaboration of the religious identity, cultivated in RCC and the modernity.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the role of standard‐setting bodies and rating agencies which compete for authority in Islamic finance. It does so through a consideration of a recent debate over the permissibility of sukuk financing. Design/methodology/approach – The methods used are a combination of archival and <b>bibliographic</b> research, <b>coupled</b> with the author's previous research on Islamic banking and finance. Findings – While the debate over sukuk hinged on whether the structures are shari'a compliant in form only, not in substance, the role of sukuk in neoliberal reform and the privatization of state resources reveal a deeper potential conflict between Islamic standard‐setting bodies and global neoliberal projects more broadly. Research limitations/implications – The implications are significant for other Islamic finance contractual forms and modes of finance. They are also significant in light of the global financial crisis, and the recent debt crisis in Dubai. The research limitations have to do with the fact that this is a fast‐moving field and the global financial crisis has destabilized many institutions – both conventional and Islamic – in structured finance. Originality/value – Few scholars have considered sukuk's legitimacy, or the competition between Islamic standard‐setting bodies and non‐Islamic global rating agencies...|$|R

50|$|Co-citation {{analysis}} {{provides a}} forward-looking assessment on document similarity {{in contrast to}} <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>Coupling,</b> which is retrospective. The citations a paper receives in the future depend {{on the evolution of}} an academic field, thus co-citation frequencies can still change. In the adjacent diagram, for example, Doc A and Doc B may still be co-cited by future documents, say Doc F and Doc G. This characteristic of co-citation allows for a dynamic document classification system when compared to <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>Coupling.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1972 Robert Amsler {{published}} a paper describing a measure for determining subject similarity between two documents by fusing <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> and co-citation analysis.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{documents}} are bibliographically coupled if they both cite {{one or more}} documents in common. The [...] "coupling strength" [...] of two given documents is higher the more citations to other documents they share. The figure to the right illustrates the concept of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling.</b> In the figure, documents A and B both cite documents C, D and E. Thus, documents A and B have a <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> strength of 3 - the number of elements in the intersection of their two reference lists.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> can {{be useful}} {{in a wide variety of}} fields, since it helps {{researchers}} find related research done in the past. On the other hand, two documents are co-cited if they are both independently cited by one or more documents.|$|E
50|$|The co-citation {{analysis}} approach {{introduced by}} Henry Small {{and published in}} 1973 addressed this shortcoming of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> by considering a document's incoming citations to assess similarity, a measure that can change over time. Additionally, the co-citation measure reflects the opinion of many authors and thus represents a better indicator of subject similarity.|$|E
5000|$|These {{approaches}} are primarily based on using bibliographical references to organize networks of papers, mainly by <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> (introduced by Kessler 1963) or co-citation analysis ( [...] independently suggested by Marshakova 1973 and Small 1973). In recent {{years it has}} become a popular activity to construe bibliometric maps as structures of research fields.|$|E
50|$|In 1981 Howard White and Belver Griffith {{introduced}} author co-citation analysis (ACA). Not until 2008 did Dangzhi Zhao and Andreas Strotmann combine {{their work}} and that of M. M. Kessler to define author <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> analysis (ABCA), noting {{that as long as}} authors are active this metric is not static and that it is particularly useful when combined with ACA.|$|E
50|$|Co-citation, like <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>Coupling,</b> is a {{semantic}} similarity measure for documents that {{makes use of}} citation relationships. Co-citation {{is defined as the}} frequency with which two documents are cited together by other documents. If at least one other document cites two documents in common these documents are said to be co-cited. The more co-citations two documents receive, the higher their co-citation strength, and {{the more likely they are}} semantically related.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of the CPA approach compared to other citation and co-citation analysis approaches is an improvement in precision. Other widely used citation analysis approaches, such as <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>Coupling,</b> Co-Citation or the Amsler measure, do {{not take into account}} the location or proximity of citations within documents. The CPA approach allows a more granular automatic classification of documents and can also be used to identify not only related documents, but the specific sections within texts that are most related.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, two {{authors are}} bibliographically coupled if the {{cumulative}} reference lists {{of their respective}} oeuvres each contain {{a reference to a}} common document, and their coupling strength also increases with the citations to other documents that their share. If the cumulative reference list of an author's oeuvre is determined as the multiset union of the documents that the author has co-authored, then the author <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> strength of two authors (or more precisely, of their oeuvres) is defined as the size of the multiset intersection of their cumulative reference lists, however.|$|E
5000|$|Documents can be {{associated}} with many other features in addition to citations, such as authors, publishers, journals as well as their actual texts. The general analysis of collections of documents is known as bibliometrics and citation analysis is a key part of that field. For example, <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> and co-citation are association measures based on citation analysis (shared citations or shared references). The citations in a collection of documents can also be represented in forms such as a citation graph, as pointed out by Derek J. de Solla Price in his 1965 article [...] "Networks of Scientific Papers". [...] This means that citation analysis draws on aspects of social network analysis and network science.|$|E
5000|$|In a 1965 paper, Derek J. de Solla Price {{described}} the inherent linking {{characteristic of the}} SCI as [...] "Networks of Scientific Papers". The links between citing and cited papers became dynamic when the SCI began to be published online. The Social Sciences Citation Index {{became one of the}} first databases to be mounted on the Dialog system in 1972. With the advent of the CD-ROM edition, linking became even easier and enabled the use of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> for finding related records. In 1973, Henry Small published his classic work on Co-Citation analysis which became a self-organizing classification system that led to document clustering experiments and eventually an [...] "Atlas of Science" [...] later called [...] "Research Reviews".|$|E
30|$|Second, <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> {{counts the}} number of {{references}} that two (or more) documents share in their bibliographies (Kessler 1963). As opposed to co-citation analysis, which is conducted {{at the level of}} cited references, <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> is an attribute of citing documents: two documents are coupled when they have at least one reference in common. Since <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> is independent of {{the number of}} received citations, the method has a focus on the present and covers more recent works than co-citation analysis. The procedure is ‘static’, because the reference lists do not change once the documents are published. Hence, the degree to which documents are coupled is definite at the time of publication.|$|E
40|$|There {{is general}} {{consensus}} that the field of nanotechnology will be very important in the future. An open question is, however, which technological approaches or paradigms will be important in the field. The paper assumes that the carbon nanotube will be {{a key element of}} an emerging technological paradigm in nanotechnology. This study employs a bibliometric method — <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> — to identify important nanotubes-related ‘leitbilder’ — a concept meaning ‘guiding images’ that provide a basis for different professions and disciplines to work in the same direction. Until recently, <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> has been applied rarely for purposes of research evaluation, not to mention technology foresight. Our case study seems to suggest that <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> is particularly suitable for anticipating technological breakthroughs. <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> analysis of recent nanotube-related patents focused our attention to recent patents owned by Nantero Inc. Nantero’s main focus is the development of NRAM — a high-density nonvolatile random access memory. The NRAM leitbild seems to be an important emerging leitbild.

40|$|In 1965, Derek de Solla Price foresaw the {{day when}} a citation-based {{taxonomy}} {{of science and technology}} would be delineated and correspondingly used for science policy. A taxonomy needs to be comprehensive and accurate {{if it is to be}} useful for policy making, especially now that policy makers are utilizing citation-based indicators to evaluate people, institutions and laboratories. Determining the accuracy of a taxonomy, however, remains a challenge. Previous work on the accuracy of partition solutions is sparse, and the results of those studies, while useful, have not been definitive. In this study we compare the accuracies of topic-level taxonomies based on the clustering of documents using direct citation, <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling,</b> and co-citation. Using a set of new gold standards - articles with at least 100 references - we find that direct citation is better at concentrating references than either <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> or co-citation. Using the assumption that higher concentrations of references denote more accurate clusters, direct citation thus provides a more accurate representation of the taxonomy of scientific and technical knowledge than either <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> or co-citation. We also find that discipline-level taxonomies based on journal schema are highly inaccurate compared to topic-level taxonomies, and recommend against their use.

We identify several clusters that can be aggregated to two broad streams of work—one ‘neo-evolutionary’, the other ‘neo-institutional’ in nature. We make this observation both for <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> and co-citation analyses which we take as indication of an emerging differentiation of the field. Our content analysis underlines this observation about the ‘two faces’ of the TH. We conclude this paper with a discussion of future opportunities for research.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of bibliometric networks, such as co-authorship, <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling,</b> and co-citation networks, {{has received a}} considerable amount of attention. Much less {{attention has been paid to}} the construction of these networks. We point out that different approaches can be taken to construct a bibliometric network. Normally the full counting approach is used, but we propose an alternative fractional counting approach. The basic idea of the fractional counting approach is that each action, such as co-authoring or citing a publication, should have equal weight, regardless of for instance the number of authors, citations, or references of a publication. We present two empirical analyses in which the full and fractional counting approaches yield very different results. These analyses deal with co-authorship networks of universities and <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> networks of journals. Based on theoretical considerations and on the empirical analyses, we conclude that for many purposes the fractional counting approach is preferable over the full counting one...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} a novel method of science mapping is {{presented}} which combines <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling,</b> {{as a measure}} of document-document similarity, with an agglomerative hierarchical cluster method. The focus in this study is on the mapping of so called ‘core documents’, a concept presented first in 1995 by Glänzel and Czerwon. The term ‘core document’ denote documents that have a central position in the research front in terms of many and strong <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> links. The identification and mapping of core documents usually requires a large multidisciplinary research setting and in this study the 2003 volume of the Science Citation Index was applied. From this database, a sub-set of core documents reporting on the outbreak of SARS in 2002 was chosen for the demonstration of the application of this mapping method. It was demonstrated that the method, in this case, successfully identified interpretable research themes and that iterative clustering on two subsequent levels of cluster agglomeration may provide with useful and current information...|$|E
40|$|While interdisciplinarity {{continues}} to increase in popularity among funders and other scientific organizations, its potential to promote scientific advances remains under-examined.

We then compare how readily those <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> clusters account for the structuring of topics covered within the field as it evolves over two decades. These comparisons challenge one-dimensional and/or cross-sectional approaches to interdisciplinarity.

30|$|Due {{to these}} differences, co-citation {{analysis}} and <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> produce different yet complementary results. However, {{the structure of}} the aggregated data is the same: the raw data are reorganized in symmetric matrices with documents as column and row headers and number of co-occurrences as values. This structure of the data corresponds to the structure of networks: in the case of co-citation analysis, the column and row headers (i.e., network nodes) are cited documents and the values (i.e., network ties) are co-citations of each pair of documents. In contrast, the method of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> results in network data with citing documents as nodes and the number of couplings as ties. Accordingly, we used these matrices as inputs to a network analysis with UCINET Version 6.581. For the detection of subgroups within the networks, we applied the Girvan–Newman clustering procedure (Girvan and Newman 2002) as well as categorical core/periphery partition (Borgatti and Everett 1999). The network graphs were created with a spring embedding algorithm as provided by the NetDraw software version 2.153.|$|E

In this paper we evaluate different processing options of noun phrases extracted from abstracts using natural language processing to improve the measurement of the lexical component.

Some scenarios show no improvement compared with the previously used single term lexical approach used so far. But when all single term shingles are removed from the dataset the lexical network has properties which are comparable with those from a <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> based network. Next, hybrid networks are built based on weighted combination of the two types of similarities with seven different weights.

40|$|Objective - This paper {{investigated}} the intellectual {{structure of the}} cited journals by science doctoral students in the University of Ibadan, Nigeria through field-mapping mechanism namely co-citation analysis. The study also explored the relationship and its strength between the science disciplines in terms of journals that were co-referenced through <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> analysis. The deployment of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> techniques with co-citation analysis was adopted to model the pattern of scientific communications among scientists and scholarly journals. Methods - The scholarly citation {{data were collected from}} science doctoral theses submitted between 2006 and 2013 across ten disciplines in the Faculty of Science, University of Ibadan. Variety of data techniques were deployed such co-citation analysis, factor analysis, and <b>bibliographic</b> <b>coupling</b> to identify the characteristics of the citation network, the subgroups that constituted the intellectual structure of the cited journals by science doctoral students, most influential journals, and degree of relation between science disciplines. Results - The bibliometric citation network analysis of science doctoral students revealed that 1, 290 journals were co-cited and 40. 62 % journals were co-referenced within two or more disciplines. Factor analysis revealed seven subgroups and network diagram largely matches the first subgroup which constitutes 88 % of the journals with total variance explained of 51. 21 % while other subgroups were beclouded. Conclusion - The analysis provide insights about citation network structure, the influence of some journals and the fair rate of indices of cross disciplinary journals, which is a good harbinger of relationship among science disciplines, though degree of association with each other differs. Meanwhile, explicit identification of specialties (subgroups) from factor analysis is still subjected to further investigations perhaps using authors as a unit of analysis.
