50|$|Starting {{with a line}} of Initial Binary cards laid {{perpendicular}} to two facing players, {{the object of the}} game is {{to be the first to}} complete a logical pyramid whose final output equals that of the rightmost Initial <b>Binary</b> <b>card</b> facing that player.|$|E
50|$|The Easycoder {{assembler}} generated {{an object}} file as a <b>binary</b> <b>card</b> deck {{that could be}} punched to cards or written to magnetic tape instead. The object file began with a bootstrapping routine so that each program could be loaded into memory, from card reader or magnetic tape, using a boot command from the console.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to broaden the scope of a {{previous}} paper and show applications of a varied nature using the binary table to generate data on which mathematical investigations can be based. Elementary applications considered are the “coins problem”, a <b>binary</b> <b>card</b> trick, Killer Sudoku, and expressing integers in terms of others in specified ways...|$|E

5000|$|Four players {{may play}} {{individually}} or as facing teams by arranging a cross of Initial <b>Binary</b> <b>cards,</b> where four logic pyramids extend like compass points in four directions ...|$|R
50|$|The NOT {{cards are}} played against {{any of the}} Initial <b>Binary</b> <b>cards</b> in play, causing that card to be rotated 180 degrees, {{literally}} “flipping” the value of that card from 0 to 1 or vice versa.|$|R
50|$|Since both players' pyramids {{share the}} Initial <b>Binary</b> <b>cards</b> as a base, “flipping” an Initial Binary {{has an effect}} on both players' pyramids. A {{principal}} strategy during game play is to invalidate gate cards in the opponent's logic pyramid while rendering as little damage to one’s own pyramid in the process.|$|R
5000|$|As a prank, in <b>binary</b> mode, <b>cards</b> {{could be}} punched where every {{possible}} punch position had a hole. Such [...] "lace cards" [...] lacked structural strength, and would frequently buckle and jam inside the machine.|$|R
5000|$|IBM 1442 was a {{combination}} IBM card reader and card punch. It read and punched 80-column IBM-format punched cards and was used on the IBM 1440, the IBM 1130, the IBM 1800 and System/360 and was an option on the IBM System/3. The 1442 could read up to 400 cards per minute. Cards were read and punched one column {{at a time and}} <b>binary</b> <b>cards</b> were permitted. Cards were read using photocells, illuminated by fiber optics, unlike the IBM 1402, which still used wire brushes to read cards. It was even possible to create (but not read) [...] "IBM Doilies," [...] cards with every possible hole punched. Few other pieces of IBM equipment could do this without sustaining damage.|$|R
50|$|The 1402 uses IBM 80-column {{punched card}} format, {{although}} an option {{was available to}} process 51-column <b>cards.</b> A column <b>Binary</b> option allowed <b>cards</b> with any combination of holes to be read and punched.|$|R
5000|$|For some {{computer}} applications, binary formats were used, {{where each}} hole represented a single binary digit (or [...] "bit"), every column (or row) {{is treated as}} a simple bitfield, and every combination of holes is permitted. For example, the IBM 711 card reader used with the 704/709/7090/7094 series scientific computers treated every row as two 36-bit words, ignoring 8 columns. (The specific 72 columns used were selectable using a plugboard control panel, which is almost always wired to select columns 1-72.) Sometimes the ignored columns (usually 73-80) were used to contain a sequence number for each card, so the card deck could be sorted to the correct order in case it was dropped. An alternative format, used by the IBM 704's IBM 714 native card reader, {{is referred to as}} Column Binary or Chinese Binary, and used 3 columns for each 36-bit word. [...] Later computers, such as the IBM 1130 or System/360, used every column. The IBM 1401's card reader could be used in Column Binary mode, which stored two characters in every column, or one 36-bit word in three columns when used as input device for other computers. However, most of the older card punches were not intended to punch more than 3 holes in a column. The multipunch key is used to produce <b>binary</b> <b>cards,</b> or other characters not on the keyboard.|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{construct}} in NoteCards is {{a semantic}} network composed of notecards connected by typed links. Each notecard contains an arbitrary {{amount of information}} embodied in text, graphics, images, or some other editable substance. Links are used to represent <b>binary</b> connections between <b>cards.</b> NoteCards provides two specialized types of cards, Browsers and FileBoxes, that help the user to manage networks of cards and links.

40|$|Attracting {{students}} into STEM disciplines {{is a necessary}} task. Of course demonstrations in physics or chemistry produce interaction and with people and engage them with science. Mathematics, despite its résumé ? summary 84 inner beauty, is {{far away from the}} main public but mathematical magic performances as the main skeleton of recreational mathematics activities has been proved useful. In this talk we discuss and introduce mathematical ideas by means of magic tricks, all of them with a mathematical background. In that sense we will deal with binary numbers, bipartition method, divisibility, logical decisions, probability, geometrical dissections and topology. So, abstract concepts are brought to general public in a more attractive way. There are deep mathematics in card shuffling and cards have been used to model different concepts. Using red/black properties it is easy dealing with even/odd numbers. Moreover, the position where a card arrives when a 'perfect' shuffle is made is related to <b>binary</b> numbers. <b>Cards</b> are also good for introducing coding systems. Finally, the movement on the stage and magician's presentation techniques are also good for communicating science and getting people attracted to these fields of knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Online {{credit card}} fraud {{presents}} a significant {{challenge in the}} field of eCommerce. In 2012 alone, the total loss due to credit card fraud in the US amounted to $ 54 billion. Especially online games merchants have difficulties applying standard fraud detection algorithms to achieve timely and accurate detection. This paper describes the special constrains of this domain and highlights the reasons why conventional algorithms are not quite effective to deal with this problem. Our suggested solution for the problem originates from the fields of feature construction joined with the field of temporal sequence data mining. We present feature construction techniques, which are able to create discriminative features based on a sequence of transaction and are able to incorporate the time into the classification process. In addition to that, a framework is presented that allows for an automated and adaptive change of features in case the underlying pattern is changing.
