5|$|Several {{organisms are}} capable of rolling locomotion; however, true wheels and propellers—despite their utility in human vehicles—do not appear to play a {{significant}} role in the movement of living things (with the exception of certain flagella, which function like corkscrews). <b>Biologists</b> <b>have</b> expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in speculative fiction.|$|E
5|$|Characteristically, Sebrights {{are only}} {{one of a few}} chicken breeds in which the roosters are hen feathered, meaning they have none of the long, sickleshaped {{feathers}} common in most roosters that appear in the tail, neck and saddle. Due to the unique characteristic hen feathering, molecular <b>biologists</b> <b>have</b> found the Sebright bantam a useful model organism in the study of sex hormones. This is because they carry a mutation that causes the tissues of their skin to convert an unusually large amount of male sex hormones (androgens) into female sex hormones (estrogens).|$|E

5|$|Generally {{grown as}} a hardy annual, lettuce is easily cultivated, {{although}} it requires relatively low temperatures {{to prevent it}} from flowering quickly. It can be plagued by numerous nutrient deficiencies, as well as insect and mammal pests, and fungal and bacterial diseases.

5|$|Another {{reason for}} DNA testing was to {{determine}} the rates of hybridization between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. The southern populations have more hybrids than are found in the middle sections of the Missouri River basin, while the northernmost populations have had few reports of hybrids. Hybrids are most common in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, and DNA sequencing in these hybrids showed a genetic distinction from pallid sturgeon, but based on the genetic markers assessed, they were genetically indistinguishable from shovelnose sturgeon. Because of this ability of two species to hybridize, some <b>biologists</b> <b>have</b> expressed concern that it is a violation of the Endangered Species Act to protect one species that may not be genetically isolated from another. It is not known if the hybrids are able to reproduce or not, although they appear {{to be the result of}} pallid sturgeon eggs being fertilized by shovelnose sturgeon males.|$|E

5|$|The {{question}} of whether selection of signals works {{at the level of}} the individual organism or gene, or {{at the level of the}} group, has been debated by biologists such as Richard Dawkins, arguing that individuals evolve to signal and to receive signals better, including resisting manipulation. Amotz Zahavi suggested that cheating could be controlled by the handicap principle, where the best horse in a handicap race is the one carrying the largest handicap weight. According to Zahavi's theory, signallers such as male peacocks have 'tails' that are genuinely handicaps, being costly to produce. The system is evolutionarily stable as the large showy tails are honest signals. <b>Biologists</b> <b>have</b> attempted to verify the handicap principle, but with inconsistent results. The mathematical biologist Ronald Fisher analysed the contribution that having two copies of each gene (diploidy) would make to honest signalling, demonstrating that a runaway effect could occur in sexual selection. The evolutionary equilibrium depends sensitively on the balance of costs and benefits.|$|E
5|$|Some animals, notably insects such as {{the honey}} bee, are {{sensitive}} to the polarisation of light. Honey bees can use polarized light on overcast days to estimate the position of the sun in the sky, relative to the compass direction they intend to travel. Karl von Frisch's work established that bees can accurately identify the direction and range from the hive to a food source (typically a patch of nectar-bearing flowers). A worker bee returns to the hive and signals to other workers the range and direction relative to the sun of the food source by means of a waggle dance. The observing bees are then able to locate the food by flying the implied distance in the given direction, though other <b>biologists</b> <b>have</b> questioned whether they necessarily do so, or are simply stimulated to go and search for food. However, bees are certainly able to remember the location of food, and to navigate back to it accurately, whether the weather is sunny (in which case navigation may be by the sun or remembered visual landmarks) or largely overcast (when polarised light may be used).|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} mockingbird is {{a species that}} is found in both urban and rural habitats. There are now more {{northern mockingbird}}s living in urban habitats than non-urban environments, so they are consequently known as an urban-positive species. <b>Biologists</b> <b>have</b> long questioned how northern mockingbirds adapt to a novel environment in cities, and whether they fall into the typical ecological traps that are common for urban-dwelling birds. A comparative study between an urban dwelling population and a rural dwelling one shows that the apparent survival is higher for individuals in the urban habitats. Lower food availability and travel costs {{may account for the}} higher mortality rate in rural habitats. Urban birds are more likely to return to the nest where they had successfully bred the previous year and avoid those where breeding success was low. One explanation for this phenomenon is that urban environments are more predictable than non-urban ones, as the site fidelity among urban birds prevents them from ecological traps. Mockingbirds are also able to utilize artificial lighting in order to feed nestlings in urban areas such as residential neighborhoods into the night in contrast to those that do not nest near those areas. The adaptation of mockingbirds in urban habitats has led it to become more susceptible to lead poisoning in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. populations.|$|E
