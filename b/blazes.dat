5|$|Through the 18thand19thcenturies, {{chestnut}} {{in various}} shades was the prevailing colour of Finnish horses, making up about 40-50percent of the breed, and bays, blacks and greys existed in much greater numbers than today: 34percent were bay, 16percent black, {{and the remaining}} 3percent were grey, palomino or spotted. Wide <b>blazes</b> and high leg markings were rare, unlike today; bold markings became common only in the 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Historian David Detzer {{has argued}} that the fame that {{surrounds}} the 11th New York is misplaced. During its time in service, the 11th New York Regiment saw little fighting compared to other well-known regiments such as the 69th New York, 20th Maine, and 28th Massachusetts. The 11th New York was often overshadowed by the 73rd New York, also known as the Second Fire Zouaves, which fought at Antietam, Gettysburg, and Appomattox. In addition, Ellsworth failed to consider that the New York City fire companies from which his troops were drawn often competed against each other at <b>blazes.</b> The cohesion he sought in firefighters did not exist and would not be created when they joined the regiment. In that respect, 11th New York was no different than many regiments, North and South.|$|E
5|$|W5 {{is found}} in Thoroughbreds {{descending}} from Puchilingui, a 1984 stallion with sabino-like white spotting and roaning. Horses with the W5 allele exhibit a huge range in white phenotype: a few have been pure white or near-white, while others have sabino-like spotting limited to high, irregular stockings and <b>blazes</b> that covered the face. Twenty-two members of this family were studied, and the 12 {{with some degree of}} dominant white spotting were found to have a deletion in exon 15 (p.T732QfsX9), {{in the form of a}} frameshift mutation. A later study found that the members of this family with the greatest depigmentation were compound heterozygotes who also carried the W20 allele.|$|E

After several adventures, Roxanne and <b>Blaze</b> were reunited, and after <b>Blaze</b> was cured of being the Ghost Rider the two married and had two children.

Now free of his curse, <b>Blaze</b> goes off to live with Roxanne. <b>Blaze</b> occasionally appeared in the subsequent 1990-1998 series, Ghost Rider, which starred a related character, Daniel Ketch.

5|$|To the south, HMS Bellerophon was {{in serious}} trouble as the huge {{broadside}} of Orient pounded the ship. At 19:50 the mizzenmast and main mast both collapsed and fires broke out simultaneously at several points. Although the <b>blazes</b> were extinguished, the ship had suffered more than 200 casualties. Captain Darby recognised that his position was untenable and ordered the anchor cables cut at 20:20. The battered ship drifted away from the battle under continued fire from Tonnant as the foremast collapsed as well. Orient had also suffered significant damage and Admiral Brueys had been struck in the midriff by a cannonball that almost cut him in half. He died fifteen minutes later, remaining on deck and refusing to be carried below. Orients captain, Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca, was also wounded, struck in the face by flying debris and knocked unconscious, while his twelve-year-old son had a leg torn off by a cannonball as he stood beside his father. The most southerly British ship, Majestic, had become briefly entangled with the 80-gun Tonnant, and in the resulting battle, suffered heavy casualties. Captain George Blagdon Westcott was among the dead, killed by French musket fire. Lieutenant Robert Cuthbert assumed command and successfully disentangled his ship, allowing the badly damaged Majestic to drift further southwards so that by 20:30 it was stationed between Tonnant and the next in line, Heureux, engaging both. To support the centre, Captain Thompson of Leander abandoned the futile efforts to drag the stranded Culloden off the shoal and sailed down the embattled French line, entering the gap created by the drifting Peuple Souverain and opening a fierce raking fire on Franklin and Orient.|$|E
25|$|On {{the week}} end of 9 and 10 December, 3,000 firefighters fought the <b>blazes.</b> Settlements at Gaffneys Creek, A1 Mine Settlement, Burns Bridge, Mount Beauty, Bright, Wandiligong and Tawonga were {{threatened}} with the fires. On 11 December 4,000 firefighters fought 13 <b>blazes.</b> The fire has destroyed Craig's Hut, an alpine hut that {{featured in the}} film The Man from Snowy River. In Gippsland on 14 December, eighteen homes were destroyed in the Heyfield–Walhalla area in <b>blazes</b> {{believed to have been}} deliberately lit. A 48-year-old man was killed falling off the back of a trailer while fighting the Gippsland fires.|$|E

25|$|Some {{of these}} firestorms are {{believed}} {{to be the result of}} arson while others were merely the result of negligence.
