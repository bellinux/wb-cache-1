The duplex bearing is radially supported by a housing, and a shaft extends through the inner race, the shaft radially and axially supported by the inner race. A first retainer is connected to the housing and engages the first axial surface of a bearing race, the movement of which race in a first direction along the axis being constrained by the first retainer. A second, resilient retainer is connected to the housing or the shaft and is deflected through engagement with the second axial face of a bearing race, the movement of which race in a second direction along the axis, opposite to the first direction, being constrained by the deflected second retainer. The bearing is preloaded by its being clamped {{between the first and second}} retainers, and the second retainer forms at least a portion of a spring having the characteristic of a substantially constant force value correlating to a range of various deflection values, whereby the preload of the bearing is substantially unaffected by variations in the deflection of the second retainer...|$|E

(some col.) This research investigated bearing failures in {{a spur gear}} cutter bar used in the agricultural equipment sector for cutting forage crops. The cutter bar is under consideration by Case-New Holland (CNH) for use in their equipment. The primary focus {{of this investigation was}} to develop and test a real time monitoring system to monitor the health of the bearings during operation and alert the operator of the location of a pending bearing failure. This system uses temperature as the monitoring parameter and does not estimate the remaining useful life after the initial failure mode has been detected. The temperature profile of interest is that just before catastrophic failure and based on that is used to alert the operator. Causes of bearing failure within the cutter bar are also investigated theoretically to determine the effect that they would have on bearing life. Both cutter bar bending and bearing misalignment were analyzed from a theoretical perspective. Bending of the cutter bar was determined to not have a detrimental effect on the contact stresses within the bearings and thus no shortening of bearing life. Bearing alignment is a critical factor in bearing condition as excessive misalignment creates high contact stresses reducing the useful life. The gear train and bearings are retained between two steel halves creating a case, and to prevent excessive misalignment the case halves cannot shift by more than 0. 47 ± 0. 04 mm relative to the vertical axis of each <b>bearing</b> <b>mount.</b> Additional testing determined that operating the cutter bar on a hill has no effect on bearing life and that oil temperature can be used to monitor the correct amount of oil in the cutter bar...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Active {{magnetic}} bearing (AMB) systems present an elegant solution to many {{problems associated with}} high-speed machinery design and operation. However, AMBs are deficient in that it allows only for contact-free suspension of rotors. Conventional rolling bearings, named backup bearings, are usually installed between the {{magnetic bearing}}s and the rotor {{in order to avoid}} machine damage in the case of suspension failure. Given the critical function fulfilled by backup bearings with respect to system safety, adequacy assessment of these bearings is vital. However, literature on the subject reveals that no established procedures exist in this regard. This need is addressed in the present study by creating computer simulation models which are capable of predicting backup bearing loads during delevitation. This provides a basis on which stress-related failure safety of the backup bearings may be evaluated. The first simulation model which is developed assumes planar dynamics of the rotor and other components. Development of this model mainly serves to resolve computer implementation issues which are relevant to the intended full model. Following development of the first model, a more detailed model is created by major expansion and modification of the developed code. The detailed model accounts for all major effects present during rotor delevitation. These include a rigid rotor model capable of accounting for three-dimensional unconstrained motion, a model of rotor-bearing contact stiffness and a model of the <b>bearing</b> <b>mount</b> stiffness. In order to ensure accurate computer implementation of the models, both are extensively verified by testing against manually obtainable solutions. Following verification, the models are also subjected to a validation process to ascertain {{the extent to which the}} models are representative of real-world behaviour. This is done by comparison of model predictions with experimental observations of a practical AMB system. Many unforeseen problems are encountered during the validation process, hindering detailed validation of the models. Notwithstanding these problems, valuable lessons are learnt which can contribute significantly to improvement of future validation attempts—a greatly lacking aspect of research in the field of rotor delevitation analysis.

40|$|Emphasis on soil {{conservation}} {{in recent times}} has been {{brought about by the}} degradation of soils due to intensive tillage operations. A relatively new tillage philosophy, coined “conservation tillage”, has opened up a new realm of tillage equipment design. The Rotary Tine Aerator (RTA) is new tillage tool that is starting to see commercial applications within the agriculture industry. Being a new tillage tool, very little information has been gathered about the RTA and especially the variables that affect tool loading. For the purpose of improving the design of the soil engaging components of the RTA, an experiment was carried out investigating the effect various settings have on tool loading. A factorial experiment was set up with three factors and two levels. The variables examined were depth, velocity of the tool carriage and tine, and the tine gang angle, with soil density and moisture content maintained constant. Draft and vertical forces on the frame were seen to increase with depth. Side loading on the bearing mounts was seen to be primarily affected by the angle of the tine gang, increasing as the gang angle increased. Tool shape was seen to affect the side loading of the bearing mounts causing the force to change directions when the tool was working and 20 cm depth and the tine gang was set a 0 º. Forward velocity was not seen to be a significant factor affecting forces on the frame. The loading in the X, Y and Z direction on the tine increased as depth increased from 10 cm to 20 cm. A decrease in force on the tine in the X, Y and Z direction was seen with increasing tine velocity. It is suggested that an overlap in soil failure zones could be the cause of this relationship. Opening the gang angle from 0 º to 10 º increased the force in the Z direction and decreased the force in the X direction. Tool shape was also seen to affect the direction of the load on the tine in the Z direction when the tine was tilling at a depth 20 cm with a tine gang of 0 º. From the information gathered in this experiment, statistical models were developed for the loading on the tine and frame. The all possible regressors approach was used to formulate the statistical models. As each regressor was added, the new equation’s fit was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R 2) and the sum of squared error (SSE). If there was a discrepancy as to whether an added regressor significantly contributed to the fit of the equation, a hypothesis test using the F-statistic was used to justify the regressors addition or removal. The models were then compared against the original data. The models developed for the tine loading showed sufficient accuracy. The models for side loading of the bearing mounts and draft loading of the tool frame contained only one significant regressor. The lowest coefficient of correlation was R= 0. 63 for the model of side loading of the <b>bearing</b> <b>mount.</b> The statistical model for the vertical loading correlated well with the test data with a coefficient of correlation of R= 0. 95...|$|E

The test rotor is a double overhung configuration with rolling element ball <b>bearings</b> <b>mounted</b> in uncentered squeeze-film oil dampers.

The dynamic performance of the test rig with the originally installed dampers with an effective damper length of length 0. 23 -inch was unacceptable. The design speed of 40, 000 RPM could not be safely achieved as nonsynchronous whirling at the overhung seal test disk and high amplitude critical speed response at the drive spline section occurred at 32, 000 RPM. In addition to the self excited stability and critical speed problems, it was later seen from FFT data analysis, that a region of supersynchronous dead band whirling occurs between 10, 000 to 15, 000 RPM which can lead to bearing distress and wear. The system was analyzed using both linear and nonlinear techniques. The extended length damper design resulting from the analysis eliminated the rotor subsynchronous whirling, high amplitude critical speed, and the dead band whirling region allowing the system to achieve a speed of 45, 000 RPM. However, nonlinear analysis shows that damper lockup could occur with high rotor unbalance at 33, 000 RPM, even with the extended squeeze-film dampers. The control of damper lockup will be addressed in a future paper...|$|R

Results from the model are compared with previous literature data, as well as with tests done on a specially-developed friction torque rig. The comparison with the literature results was done for two specific cases: (i) when only one out of the two contact lines in the four-point contact bearing is active (effectively creating a two-point contact bearing); and (ii) where both contact lines in the four-point contact bearing are active. Further, the comparison was done with a custom-built friction torque rig with FAG QJ 309 bearings, again for two cases: (i) <b>bearings</b> <b>mounted</b> with a specific clearance (two-point contact); and (ii) <b>bearings</b> <b>mounted</b> with larger size balls to obtain interference (four-point contact).
