25|$|Only a {{fraction}} of the permafrost zone consists of actual ground ice. The remainder (dry permafrost) is simply soil or rock at subfreezing temperatures. The ice volume is generally greatest in the uppermost permafrost layers and mainly comprises pore and segregated ice in Earth material. Measurements of <b>bore-hole</b> temperatures in permafrost can be used as indicators of net changes in temperature regime. Gold and Lachenbruch (1973) infer a 2-4nbsp&°C warming over 75 to 100 years at Cape Thompson, Alaska, where the upper 25% of the 400-m thick permafrost is unstable with respect to an equilibrium profile of temperature with depth (for the present mean annual surface temperature of -5nbsp&°C). Maritime influences may have biased this estimate, however. At Prudhoe Bay similar data imply a 1.8nbsp&°C warming over the last 100 years (Lachenbruch et al. 1982). Further complications may be introduced by changes in snow-cover depths and the natural or artificial disturbance of the surface vegetation.|$|E

40|$|Scarcity {{of water}} within and around Northern Nigeria {{is no longer}} a wieldy issue. There is an over {{reliance}} on groundwater, and this has led to {{an increase in the number}} of <b>bore-holes</b> drilled in order to augment the water needs within the study area. Unfortunately the failure of many installed <b>bore-holes</b> has been rampant in this area. This is due to absence of or improper groundwater investigation and interpretation of site suitability. In this study, a remote sensing approach was employed to delineate and classify groundwater potentials of the Sokoto basin. GIS-based groundwater potential map of Sokoto Basin was modelled by producing and subsequently combining thematic maps. The data set includes; drainage, lineament, soil, lithology, elevation, slope and rainfall. Thematic maps of each data set were produced as distinct layers first before combining them together. For each layer, weighting for different classes was performed. The ground water potential map was then reclassified into five classes; very good, good, moderate to good, moderate and poor class. Results from the maps produced show that areas mapped indicating zones of very-good groundwater potential covers approximately 2. 2 % (1432. 66 km 2); zones mapped indicating good groundwater potential covers approximately 7. 79 % (5071. 5237 km 2); zones mapped indicating moderate to good groundwater potential covers approximately 27. 5 % (17577. 8 Km 2); zones mapped indicating moderate groundwater potential covers approximate 49. 2 % (32030. 676 km 2) and zones mapped indicating poor groundwater potential covers approximately 13. 1 % (8528. 493 Km 2) of the study area.
