The entire transaction had netted Leavitt a tidy profit, which he invested in other ventures.|$|E

25|$|In {{his next}} large transactions, the 25-year-old Leavitt again {{demonstrated}} his business acumen. The government of Colombia, facing a conflict at home, had paid {{a group of}} New York merchants to build a warship and equip it with armaments {{for use by the}} South American nation. Ultimately, those building the vessel were unable to complete the transaction, and Leavitt stepped in, paying for the ship's construction, and assuring that the United States government would help arm it with munitions. Leavitt then took command of the vessel, sailing it to South America, where the Colombian government paid him $100,000 in Colombian currency, and an additional $100,000 in a London <b>bank</b> <b>draft.</b>|$|E

50|$|In Canada, <b>bank</b> <b>drafts</b> do {{not carry}} any {{different}} legal weight {{as opposed to}} a standard check, but are provided as a service to clients as a payment instrument with guaranteed funds. Drafts (or money orders depending on the issuing institution) usually have better security features than standard checks, and as such are often preferred when the receiver is concerned about receiving fraudulent payment instruments. However, <b>bank</b> <b>drafts</b> can also be subject to counterfeiting, and as such can be held or verified by depositing institutions in accordance with their hold funds policy, prior to providing access to the funds.|$|R
