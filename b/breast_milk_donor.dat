40|$|Human milk is {{the optimal}} food for human infants, {{including}} infants born prematurely. In {{the event that}} a mother of a hospitalized infant cannot provide <b>breast</b> <b>milk,</b> <b>donor</b> milk is considered an acceptable alternative. It is known that the macronutrient composition of donor milk is different than human milk, with variable fat content and protein content. However, much less {{is known about the}} micronutrient content of donor milk, including nutritional antioxidants. Samples of breast milk from 12 mothers of infants hospitalized in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit until were collected and analyzed for concentrations of nutritional antioxidants, including α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein + zeaxanthin, retinol, and α-tocopherol. Additionally, a homogenized sample of donor milk available from a commercial milk bank and samples of infant formulas were also analyzed. Concentrations of nutritional antioxidants were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Compared to breast milk collected from mothers of hospitalized infants, commercially available donor milk had 18 %– 53 % of the nutritional antioxidant content of maternal breast milk. As donor milk is becoming a common nutritional intervention for the high risk preterm infant, the nutritional antioxidant status of donor milk–fed premature infants and outcomes related to oxidative stress may merit further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{importance}} of breast milk for infants ’ growth, development and overall health is widely recognized.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{importance}} of breast milk for infants' growth, development and overall health is widely recognized. In situations {{where women are}} not able to provide their infants with sufficient amounts of their own <b>breast</b> <b>milk,</b> <b>donor</b> breast milk is the next preferred option. Although there is considerable research on the safety and scientific aspects of donor milk, and the motivations and experiences of donors, there is limited research addressing the attitudes and experiences of the women and families whose infants receive this milk. This study therefore examined attitudes towards donated breast milk among mothers, families and healthcare providers of potential recipient infants.

The qualitative data was derived from eight focus group discussions which included four groups with mothers; one with male partners; and one with grandmothers, investigating attitudes towards receiving donated breast milk for infants. There was also one group each with nurses and doctors about their attitudes towards donated breast milk and its use in the hospital. The focus groups were conducted in September and October 2009 and each group had between four and eleven participants, leading to a total of 48 participants. Results Although breast milk was seen as important to child health there were concerns about undermining of breast milk because of concerns about HIV and marketing and promotion of formula milks. In addition there were concerns about the safety of donor breast milk and discomfort about using another mother's milk. Participants believed that education on the {{importance of}} breast milk and transparency on the processes involved in sourcing and preparing donor milk would improve the acceptability. Conclusions This study has shown that there are obstacles to the acceptability of donor milk, mainly stemming from lack of awareness/familiarity with the processes around donor breast milk and that these could be readily addressed through education. Even the more psychological concerns would also likely be reduced over time as these educational efforts progress. With government and health care worker endorsement and commitment, breast milk donation could have a promising role in improving child health. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The role of {{bacterial}} pathogens in lactational mastitis remains unclear. The {{objective of this}} study was to compare bacterial species in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> of women with mastitis and of healthy <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> <b>donors</b> and to evaluate the use of antibiotic therapy, the symptoms of mastitis, number of health care contacts, occurrence of breast abscess, damaged nipples and recurrent symptoms in relation to bacterial counts. Methods In this descriptive study, <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> from 192 women with mastitis (referred to as cases) and 466 <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> <b>donors</b> (referred to as controls) was examined bacteriologically and compared using analytical statistics. Statistical analyses were also carried out to test for relationships between bacteriological content and clinical symptoms as measured on scales, prescription of antibiotics, the number of care contacts, occurrence of breast abscess and recurring symptoms. Results Five main bacterial species were found in both cases and controls: coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS), viridans streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Group B streptococci (GBS) and Enterococcus faecalis. More women with mastitis had S. aureus and GBS in their <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> than those without symptoms, although 31 % of healthy women harboured S. aureus and 10 % had GBS. There were no significant correlations between bacterial counts and the symptoms of mastitis as measured on scales. There were no differences in bacterial counts between those prescribed and not prescribed antibiotics or those with and without breast abscess. GBS in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> was associated with increased health care contacts (p = 0. 02). Women with ≥ 10 7 cfu/L CNS or viridans streptococci in their <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> had increased odds for damaged nipples (p = 0. 003). Conclusion Many healthy breastfeeding women have potentially pathogenic bacteria in their <b>breast</b> <b>milk.</b> Increasing bacterial counts did not affect the clinical manifestation of mastitis; thus bacterial counts in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> may be of limited value in the decision to treat with antibiotics as results from bacterial culture of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> may be difficult to interpret. These results suggest that the division of mastitis into infective or non-infective forms may not be practically feasible.

50|$|<b>Milk</b> <b>donors</b> are {{new mothers}} who are in good health, whose infants are growing, thriving, and under six months old when they begin (Arnold, 1997). Some milk banks accept milk from mothers whose baby is {{up to a year}} old. Women who have given their baby up for adoption, acted as a surrogate, or are a {{bereaved}} mother may also donate. Because there is some risk of passing infections and viruses to babies through <b>breast</b> <b>milk,</b> <b>donors</b> must undergo a medical screening and a blood test to rule out infectious diseases such as HIV-1 and-2, hepatitis B and C and syphilis (Arnold, 1997).

40|$|Background: <b>Breast</b> <b>milk</b> {{has many}} good qualities and {{recommendations}} declare that <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> alone {{is the most}} favorable choice for newborn babies {{up to six months}} of age. When the mother can´t provide her own <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> for her baby, <b>donor</b> <b>milk</b> is a valuable source. Unfortunately the demand is often higher than the supply and thereby milk banks suffer from shortages. Aim: Highlighting women's experiences of being <b>milk</b> <b>donors.</b> Method: The study has been conducted as a literature review in which existing research has been used. Results: A common reason why women donate <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> is that they have a surplus of <b>breast</b> <b>milk.</b> <b>Milk</b> <b>donors</b> are empathetic and have an altruistic attitude toward milk donation. Women who donate breastmilk value good support from both family and professionals. Knowledge about milk donation and need of breastmilk is motivating for women. Some women who encountered difficulties chose to donate directly to needy families instead of to the milk bank. Conclusion: Lack of information and knowledge are barriers to donation. Nurses should have a good knowledge of the donation process from the woman's perspective and experiences, in order to meet women's needs for information, counseling, care and support. Strive should be to as far as possible facilitate the woman during the donation...|$|R
40|$|Background. Today, in Russia {{there is}} no {{practice}} of using <b>donor</b> <b>milk</b> in hospitals, while abroad {{it is a common}} technique of caring for premature and low-weight infants. Objective : Our aim was to study the milk donation awareness of parents of {{children under the age of}} 1, health workers and lactation consultants. Methods. A sample survey was carried out. Results. The study involved 2, 332 respondents from 13 medical institutions in 11 cities and towns located in 6 federal districts of the Russian Federation, including 1, 134 mothers,  413 fathers, 692 health workers, and 93 lactation consultants. 1, 007 (65. 1 %) parents (mothers and fathers) and 541 (68. 9 %) specialists (health workers and lactation consultants) believe that feeding of a sick newborn with <b>donor</b> <b>milk</b> is useful in the absence of <b>breast</b> <b>milk.</b>  Only 609 (39. 4 %) parents and 363 (46. 2 %) professionals would agree to use <b>donor</b> <b>milk</b> for their children in the absence or lack of mother’s milk. Only 1 / 3 of the respondents — 560 (36. 2 %) parents and 259 (33. 0 %) professionals — believe that <b>donor</b> <b>milk</b> is safe.   565 (36. 5 %) parents and 475 (60. 5 %) professionals have heard something about <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> banks and 1, 013 (65. 5 %) parents and 449  (57. 2 %) professionals believe that the establishment of such banks is reasonable.

The authors hereby present the experiences and the objective lessons obtained through operating a nationwide human milk bank {{over a period of}} 2 years. Methods : The characteristics of the donors and the recipients and the amounts of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> donated, processed, and received at the East-West Neo Medical Center Human Milk Bank were investigated from August 2007 to August 2009. Results : The donor pool consisted of 131 first-time donors and 39 repeat donors who made 341 and 127 donations, respectively. Seventy-nine percent of the donors resided in the Seoul-Kyunggi area, and 60 &# 37; of the donors were in their 30 s. Most information and motivation came from the Internet (66 &# 37;) or television (14 &# 37;). A total of 2, 736 L of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> was collected, and 1, 979 L were processed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: When {{sufficient}} maternal <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> is not available, {{the alternative}} sources of enteral nutrition for preterm or low birth weight infants are <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> or artificial formula milk. Feeding preterm or low birth weight infants with formula milk might increase nutrient input and growth rates. However, since feeding with formula milk {{may be associated with}} a higher incidence of feeding intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis, this may adversely affect growth and development. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of formula <b>milk</b> compared with <b>donor</b> human <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> on growth and development in preterm or low birth weight infants. SEARCH STRATEGY: The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 - May 2007), EMBASE (1980 - May 2007), CINAHL (1982 - May 2007), conference proceedings, and previous reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing feeding with formula <b>milk</b> versus <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> in preterm or low birth weight infants. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by two reviewer authors, and synthesis of data using relative risk, risk difference and weighted mean difference. MAIN RESULTS: Eight trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Only one trial used nutrient-fortified <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk.</b> Enteral feeding with formula <b>milk</b> compared with <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> resulted in higher rates of growth in the short term. There was no evidence of an effect on long-term growth rates or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Meta-analysis of data from five trials demonstrated a statistically significantly higher incidence of necrotising enterocolitis in the formula fed group: typical relative risk 2. 5 (95 % confidence interval 1. 2, 5. 1); typical risk difference: 0. 03 (95 % confidence interval 0. 01, 0. 06; number needed to harm: 33 (95 % confidence interval 17, 100). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In preterm and low birth weight infants, feeding with formula <b>milk</b> compared with <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> results in a higher rate of short-term growth but also a higher risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis. There are only limited data on the comparison of feeding with formula <b>milk</b> versus nutrient-fortified <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk.</b> This limits the applicability of the findings as nutrient fortification of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> is now a common practice in neonatal care. Future trials may compare growth, development and adverse outcomes in infants who receive formula <b>milk</b> versus nutrient-fortified <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> given as a supplement to maternal expressed <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> or as a sole diet...|$|R

These diets were compared as sole enteral feeds or as supplements to the mother's expressed <b>breast</b> <b>milk.</b> No differences in outcome at 18 months were seen {{between the two}} diet groups despite the low nutrient content of <b>donor</b> <b>milk</b> {{in relation to the}} preterm formula and to the estimated needs of preterm infants. These results contrast with those reported from our parallel two centre study that compared infants randomly assigned a standard term formula or the preterm formula during their early weeks; those fed standard formula, now regarded as nutritionally insufficient for preterm infants, were substantially disadvantaged in PDI and MDI at 18 months post-term. It is shown here that infants from that study fed solely on standard formula had significantly lower developmental scores at 18 months than those fed on <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> in the present study; yet the standard formula had a higher nutrient content than the <b>donor</b> <b>milk.</b> Thus, <b>donor</b> <b>milk</b> feeding was associated with advantages for later development that may have offset any potentially deleterious effects of its low nutrient content for preterm infants.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Modeling adverse {{outcomes}} in very {{low birth weight}} infants based on an infant diet of mother’s <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> and <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> Objective: This study evaluated the dose and threshold effects of mother’s <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> (MBM), <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> (DBM), and preterm formula (PTF) fed to very low birth weight (VLBW) infants on specific adverse health outcomes measured from birth to discharge from the hospital. This study contributes {{to the understanding of}} how much MBM is necessary during a premature infant’ hospitalization to improve health outcomes. It also provides information on the effects of DBM and PTF upon premature infant health outcomes. Methods: The current study is a retrospective analysis of VLBW infants who received MBM and/or DBM from birth to 1, 800 grams. When MBM was not available, infants were fed PTF after 1, 800 grams until discharge from the hospital. Any VLBW infant born at the University of Washington Medical Center Seattle, WA, after the initiation of the center’s DBM program was included in this study. Infants were excluded if any major congenital anomalies existed. The DBM program included infants born at 32 weeks or less gestational age or weighing {{less than or equal to}} 1, 800 grams. VLBW infants were eligible for DBM until 33 weeks gestational age and weight was greater than 1, 800 grams. Once an infant was no longer eligible for DBM, the infant was transitioned to preterm formula (PTF) if there was not enough MBM. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize quantitative variables. Dosage and threshold effects of MBM, DBM, and PTF for VLBW infants were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis, and mortality were analyzed using logistic regression models. Predictor variables included the percentage of MBM, DBM, and PTF in the infants’ total diet of all milk types from birth to discharge. Length of stay, weight gain, and total days on ventilator were regressed upon the percentage of MBM, DBM, and PTF in the infant’s total diet. Covariates included birthweight, gestational age, gender, Apgar scores at both 1 and 5 minutes, exposure to prenatal and postnatal steroids. Outcomes: The outcomes for this study included the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis, mortality, length of hospital stay, weight gain, and total days on ventilator for VLBW infants who were fed MBM, DMB, and PTF. Results: A total of 302 low birth weight infants were included in this study. The mean gestational age was 28. 65 ± 3. 08 weeks and mean birthweight is 1. 02 kg ± 0. 30 kg. The sample is 53. 3 % male and 46. 7 % female infants. The mean length of stay is 67. 37 ± 37. 01 days with the mean discharge weight of 2. 92 kg ± 1. 09 kg. Among the participants, 55. 6 % had bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 27. 2 % experienced medical necrotizing enterocolitis, 27. 2 % had late-onset sepsis, and 18. 5 % died. Logistic regression analyses showed that the percentage of MBM significantly predicted a decrease in BPD but not medical necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis, or mortality. The increased percentage of MBM contributed to a reduction in length of stay and total days ventilated. The percentage of DBM yielded comparable results for these outcomes. ROC analysis showed that a diet composed of greater than 65. 5 % of MBM (odds ratio = 0. 56, p = 0. 050) was associated with survival, whereas a diet with greater than 31. 5 % of PTF (odds ratio = 1. 94, p = 0. 029) was associated with mortality...|$|R
40|$|Preterm infants {{have higher}} {{nutrient}} requirements than term infants. Enteral tube feeding {{is the preferred}} route to feed preterm infants because premature infants are unable to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing. There are two common tube feeding methods: intermittent (bolus) or continuous infusion. Minimal enteral nutrition or trophic feeding has many advantages for preterms and should be started {{as soon as possible}} if an infant is clinically stable. Mother’s own milk is the best food for preterm infants. It also has many important non-nutrient advantages for preterm infants. However, <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> alone may not meet their special nutritional needs. For this reason, it is common clinical practice to fortify human milk. Fortified human milk is an appropriate nutritional source for preterm infants compared to preterm formula and unfortified human milk.

We found that centrifugation of EV down into density gradients largely improved density-based separation and isolation of EV, compared to floatation up into gradients after high-force pelleting of EV. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we identified different subpopulations of human <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> EV and a not previously described population of lipid tubules. Additionally, the impact of cold storage on <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> EV was investigated. We determined that storing unprocessed <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> at − 80 °C or 4 °C caused death of cells present in <b>breast</b> <b>milk,</b> leading to contamination of the <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> EV population with storage-induced EV. Here, an alternative method is proposed to store <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> samples for EV analysis at later time points. The proposed adaptations to the <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> storage and EV isolation procedures can be applied for EV-based biomarker profiling of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> and functional analysis of the role of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> EV in the development of the neonatal immune system...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In {{addition}} to meeting nutritional requirements, <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> plays {{important roles in}} biodefense for nursing in-fants. Dioxins have been detected at high concentrations in <b>breast</b> <b>milk,</b> raising concerns about disorders in nursing infants caused by <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> containing dioxins in Japan. We analyzed dioxin levels in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> and maternal blood samples from 35 pregnant women in Japan. We also measured immunoglobulin (Ig) A concentrations in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> and investigated cor-relations with dioxin concentrations. In addition, 18 of the 35 women took Chlorella pyrenoidosa (Chlorella) supplements during pregnancy, and the effects on dioxin and IgA concentrations in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> were investigated. Toxic equivalents were significantly lower in the <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> of women taking Chlorella tablets than in the Control group (P. 003). These results suggest that Chlorella supplementation by the mother may reduce transfer of dioxins to the child through <b>breast</b> <b>milk.</b> No sig-nificant correlation was identified between dioxin and IgA concentrations in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> in the Control group. It is unlikely that normal levels of dioxin exposure via food have a remarkable influence on IgA in <b>breast</b> <b>milk.</b> IgA concentrations in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> in the Chlorella group {{were significantly higher than}} in the Control group (P. 03). Increasing IgA levels in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> is considered to be effective for reducing the risk of infection in nursing infants. The present results suggest that Chlorella supplementation not only reduces dioxin levels in <b>breast</b> <b>milk,</b> but may also have beneficial effects on nursing infants by in-creasing IgA levels in <b>breast</b> <b>milk.</b> KEY WORDS: • Chlorella pyrenoidosa • co-planar polychlorinated biphenyls • maternal blood • polychlorinate...|$|R

Most HIV-infected infants acquire HIV through breastfeeding. Paradoxically, most infants breastfed by HIV-positive women do not become infected. This is potentially attributed to anti-HIV factors in <b>breast</b> <b>milk.</b> <b>Breast</b> <b>milk</b> of HIV-negative women can inhibit HIV infection. However, the HIV-inhibitory activity of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> fromHIV-positive mothers has not been evaluated.

40|$|Objective: {{postnatal}} HIV- 1 {{mother-to-child transmission}} (MTCT) occurs {{in spite of}} antiretroviral therapy. Co-infections in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) are associated with increased HIV- 1 shedding in this compartment. We investigated CMV levels and EBV detection in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> as potential risk factors for MTCT of HIV- 1 via breastfeeding. Methods: cell-free HIV- 1 RNA, cell-associated HIV- 1 DNA, CMV and EBV DNA were quantified in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> from 62 HIV-infected mothers and proven postnatal MTCT of HIV- 1 via breastfeeding. Controls were 62 HIV-positive mothers with HIV-uninfected infants. Results: median (interquartile range) CMV DNA viral load was significantly higher in cases [88 ? 044 (18 ? 586 – 233 ? 904) ] than in controls [11 ? 167 (3221 – 31 ? 152) ]?copies/ 106 <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> cells (P?<? 0. 001). <b>Breast</b> <b>milk</b> CMV DNA level correlated positively with <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> HIV- 1 RNA level in cases and controls. EBV DNA was detectable in {{a higher proportion of}} <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> samples of cases (37. 1 %) than controls (16. 1 %; P?=? 0. 009). HIV- 1 MTCT was strongly associated with HIV- 1 RNA shedding in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> and plasma. In multivariable analysis, every 1 log 10 increase in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> CMV DNA was associated with a significant 2. 5 -fold greater odds of MTCT of HIV- 1, independent of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> and plasma HIV- 1 levels; the nearly three-fold increased risk of HIV- 1 MTCT with <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> EBV DNA detection did not reach significance. Conclusion: we provide the first evidence of an independent association between CMV in <b>breast</b> <b>milk,</b> and postnatal MTCT of HIV- 1.

40|$|BACKGROUND: When {{sufficient}} maternal <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> is not available, {{alternative sources}} of enteral nutrition for preterm or low birth weight infants are <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> or artificial formula. <b>Donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> may retain some of the non-nutritive benefits of maternal <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> for preterm or low birth weight infants. However, feeding with artificial formula may ensure more consistent delivery of optimal levels of nutrients. Uncertainty exists about the balance of {{risks and benefits of}} feeding formula versus <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> for preterm or low birth weight infants. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of feeding with formula compared with <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> on growth and development in preterm or low birth weight infants. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2014), EMBASE (1980 to March 2014), CINAHL (1982 to March 2014), conference proceedings and previous reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing feeding with formula versus <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> in preterm or low birth weight infants. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Group, with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by two review authors. MAIN RESULTS: Nine trials, in which 1070 infants participated, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Four trials compared standard term formula versus <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> and five compared nutrient-enriched preterm formula versus <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk.</b> Only the two most recent trials used nutrient-fortified <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk.</b> The trials contain various methodological quality weaknesses, specifically uncertainty about adequate allocation concealment methods in three trials and lack of blinding in most of the trials. Formula-fed infants had higher in hospital rates of increase in weight [mean difference (MD) : 2. 58 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 98 to 3. 71) g/kg/day], length [MD 1. 93 (95 % CI 1. 23 to 2. 62) mm/week] and head circumference [MD 1. 59 (95 % CI 0. 95 to 2. 24) mm/week]. We did not find evidence of an effect on post-discharge growth rates or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Formula feeding increased the risk of necrotising enterocolitis: typical risk ratio 2. 77 (95 % CI 1. 40 to 5. 46); risk difference 0. 04 (95 % CI 0. 02 to 0. 07). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In preterm and low birth weight infants, feeding with formula compared with <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> results in a higher rate of short-term growth but also a higher risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis. Limited data on the comparison of feeding with formula versus nutrient-fortified <b>donor</b> <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> are available. This limits the applicability of the findings of this review as nutrient fortification of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> is now a common practice in neonatal care.

The influence of dietary and <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> fatty acids on <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> immune factors is poorly defined. We determined the fatty acid composition and immune factor concentrations of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> from women residing in river & lake, coastal, and inland regions of China, which differ in their consumption of lean fish and oily fish. <b>Breast</b> <b>milk</b> samples were collected on days 3 to 5 (colostrum), 14 and 28 post-partum and analysed for soluble CD 14 (sCD 14), transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1, TGF-β 2, secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and fatty acids. The fatty acid composition of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> differed between regions and with time post-partum. The concentrations of all four immune factors in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> decreased over time, with sCD 14, sIgA and TGF-β 1 being highest in colostrum in the river & lake region. <b>Breast</b> <b>milk</b> DHA and arachidonic acid (AA) were positively associated, and γ-linolenic acid and EPA negatively associated, with the concentrations {{of each of the}} four immune factors.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Breast</b> <b>milk</b> {{is a major}} {{route of}} infant HIV infection, yet the {{majority}} of breast-fed, HIV-exposed infants escape infection by unknown mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate the role of HIV-specific <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> cells in preventing infant HIV infection. DESIGN: A prospective {{study was designed to}} measure associations between maternal <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> HIV-specific interferon-γ (IFN-γ) responses and infant HIV- 1 detection at 1 month of age. METHODS: In a Kenyan cohort of HIV-infected mothers, blood and <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> HIV-gag IFN-γ ELISpot responses were measured. Logistic regression was used to measure associations between <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> IFN-γ responses and infant HIV infection at 1 month of age. RESULTS: IFN-γ responses were detected in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> from 117 of 170 (69 %) women. IFN-γ responses were associated with <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> viral load, levels of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 1 α, MIP- 1 β, regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed, and secreted and stromal-cell derived factor 1 and subclinical mastitis. Univariate factors associated with infant HIV infection at 1 month postpartum included both detection and breadth of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> IFN-γ response (P = 0. 08, P = 0. 04, respectively), <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> MIP- 1 β detection (P = 0. 05), and plasma (P = 0. 004) and <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> (P = 0. 004) viral load. In multivariate analyses adjusting for <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> viral load and MIP- 1 β, <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> IFN-γ responses were associated with an approximately 70 % reduction in infant HIV infection [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0. 29, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 092 - 0. 91], and each additional peptide pool targeted was associated with an approximately 35 % reduction in infant HIV (aOR 0. 65, 95 % CI 0. 44 - 0. 97). CONCLUSION: These data show <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> HIV-gag-specific IFN-γ cellular immune responses are prevalent and may contribute to protection from early HIV transmission. More broadly, these data suggest <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> cellular responses are potentially influential in decreasing mother-to-child transmission of viruses...|$|R
40|$|Context: Breastfed infants rely on {{adequate}} maternal dietary iodine intake. Objective: Our {{objective was}} to measure <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> iodine and perchlorate, an inhibitor of iodide transport into the thyroid and potentially into <b>breast</b> <b>milk,</b> in Boston-area women. Participants: The study included 57 lactating healthy volunteers in the Boston area. Measurements: <b>Breast</b> <b>milk</b> iodine and perchlorate concentrations and urine iodine, perchlorate, and cotinine concentrations were measured. For comparison, iodine and perchlorate levels in infant formulae were also measured. Results: Median <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> iodine content in 57 samples was 155 μg/liter (range, 2. 7 - 1968 μg/liter). Median urine iodine was 114 μg/liter (range, 25 - 920 μg/liter). Perchlorate was detectable in all 49 <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> samples (range, 1. 3 - 411 μg/liter), all 56 urine samples (range, 0. 37 - 127 μg/liter), and all 17 infant formula samples (range, 0. 22 - 4. 1 μg/liter) measured. <b>Breast</b> <b>milk</b> iodine content was significantly correlated with urinary iodine per gram creatinine and urinary cotinine but was not significantly correlated with <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> or urinary perchlorate. Conclusions: Perchlorate exposure was not significantly correlated with <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> iodine concentrations.

The predominant RNA variant in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> and blood was however the same for the third mother. Unexpectedly, the pattern of free virus variants in <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> of three mothers did not correspond to that of the proviral form, suggesting that free viruses do not derive from infected cells in <b>breast</b> <b>milk.</b> The observation of a compartmentalization of HIV- 1 between peripheral blood and <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> emphasizes that postnatal transmission of HIV occurs with variants that may not be predicted from the analysis of circulating viral populations...|$|R
