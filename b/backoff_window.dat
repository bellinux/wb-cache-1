40|$|Communicating over a {{wireless}} channel poses many unique challenges {{not found in}} wired communication because of the special characteristics of the wireless channel. The capacity in {{a wireless}} network is typically scarce {{as a result of}} the limited bandwidth and many distinct phenomenons, like attenuation and interference, that work destructively on the received signals. The Medium Access Control (MAC) layer is responsible for sharing this limited resource among the users. This allocation problem should be handled by considering the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of each user as to maximize the utility. Efficient MAC algorithms are crucial in minimizing collisions between transmissions and thus achieving high utilization of the channel. This thesis focuses on conflict resolution and service differentiation algorithms for wireless local area networks, where there is no central control of the channel and each sender independently contends for access. In part I, we study three approaches to improve the IEEE 802. 11 (e) standards with focus on QoS. In the first approach, utility functions are considered, that model application preferences, to achieve service differentiation and maximize the aggregated utility. We provide algorithms for two subsidiary problems that arise from the maximization problem, and show that a near [...] optimal solution is found. In the second approach a collision detection algorithm for multicast transmissions is proposed, that increases the reliability for multicast compared to the protected unicast traffic. The third approach is an improved MAC algorithm for the QoS standard IEEE 802. 11 e. The improved algorithm outperforms the standard and achieves close to optimal performance for large number of scenarios, which significantly reduces the need of adjusting the contention parameters. In part II, we focus on channel bursting protocols that use noise bursts to resolve channel conflicts. These protocols is capable of achieving very low collision probability. We propose two new bursting protocols, that achieve very high channel utilization, and show that the bursting technique has good fairness properties and provides efficient support for service differentiation. We also show that it is possible to reduce the number of bursts without loosing performance. In part III, the optimal backoff distribution that minimizes the collision probability is derived. We then propose a heuristic backoff distribution with similar properties that yields high channel utilization.

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes two {{schemes to}} improve the TCP {{performance}} over 802. 11 WLAN access protocol. In the standard 802. 11 and TCP protocols, a TCP data segment is acknowledged twice, once at the MAC layer, and once at the TCP layer. By a simple cross-layer design, a TCP ACK agent is installed at the WLAN AP. When a MAC acknowledgment is received by the AP, the AP generates a TCP ACK {{on behalf of the}} WLAN stations. Together with the TCP ACK agent scheme, an auto-zoom backoff algorithm is proposed to further improve the access performance. In the auto-zoom <b>backoff,</b> the contention <b>windows</b> can be progressively reduced to a very low value in case of light or asymmetric traffic, and return to normal quickly when collision occurs.

40|$|Applications {{in mobile}} ad-hoc {{networks}} can suffer from poor link quality and degraded network services.

To address this problem, we leverage a well-known concept of dynamic TCP proxies but propose to dynamically install these proxies along a routing path based on the quality of the links comprising the path. By enclosing poor quality path segments between a pair of TCP proxies, we isolate the effect of these segments on the rest of the network and improve the overall performance. We further utilize cross-layer optimization to select proxy locations without a separate signaling protocol, by leveraging existing messages in the underlying routing protocol. We demonstrate the potential benefits of this dynamic TCP proxies mechanism, and illustrate the relevance of host mobility level on this design choice. 1...|$|R

30|$|In CAP, each node {{performs}} the CSMA/CA algorithm before transmitting data packet or control frame. Each node maintains three parameters: {{the number of}} <b>backoffs</b> (NB), contention <b>window</b> (CW), and <b>backoff</b> exponent (BE). The initial values of NB, CW, and BE are equal to 0, 2, and macMinBE, respectively, where macMinBE is equal to 3. In the located boundary of the next backoff period, a node takes delay for random backoff between 0 and 2 BE - 1 (2 BE minus 1) unit backoff period (UBP), where UBP is equal to 20 symbols (or 80 bits). A node performs clear channel assessment (CCA) to make sure whether the channel is idle or busy, {{when the number of}} random backoff periods is decreased to 0. The value of CW will be decreased by one if the channel is idle; and the second CCA will be performed if the value of CW is not equal to 0.

However, if the CCA is busy, the value of CW will be reset to 2; the value of NB is increased by 1; and the value of BE is increased by 1 up to the maximum BE (macMaxBE), where the value macMaxBE is equal to 5. The node will repeatedly take random delay if the value of NB is less than the value of macMaxCSMABackoff, where the value of macMaxCSMABackoff is equal to 4; and the transmission attempt fails if the value of NB is greater than the value of macMaxCSMABackoff.|$|R
40|$|Backoff {{strategies}} have typically been analyzed by making statistical assumptions {{on the distribution}} of problem inputs. Although these analyses have provided valuable insights into the efficacy of various backoff strategies, they leave open the question as to which backoff algorithms perform best in the worst case or on inputs, such as bursty inputs, that are not covered by the statistical models. This paper analyzes randomized backoff strategies using worst-case assumptions on the inputs. Specifically, we analyze algorithms for simple multiple-access channels, where the only feedback from each attempt to send a packet is a single bit indicating whether the transmission succeeded or the packet collided with another packet. We analyze a class of strategies, called window strategies, where each packet partitions time into a sequence (W₁, W₂, [...] .) of windows. Within each window, the packet makes an access attempt during a single randomly selected slot. If its transmission is unsuccessful, it waits for its slot in the next window before retrying. We use delay-sequence arguments to show that for the batch problem, in which n packets all arrive at time 0, if every window has size W = Θ(n), then with high probability, all packets successfully transmit with makespan n lg lg n ± O(n). We use this result to analyze <b>window</b> <b>backoff</b> strategies with varying window sizes. Specifically, we show that the familiar binary exponential backoff algorithm, where Wk = Θ(2 k), has makespan Θ(n lg n), and that more generally, for any constant r > 1, the r-exponential backoff algorithm in which Wk = Θ(rk) has makespan Θ(n lglg rn). We also show that for any constant r > 1, the r-polynomial backoff algorithm, in which Wk = Θ(kr), has makespan Θ((n/lg n) ¹⁺¹/r). All of these batch strategies are monotonic, {{in the sense that the}} window size monotonically increases over time. We exhibit a monotonic backoff algorithm that achieves makespan Θ(n lg lg n/lg lg lg n). We prove that this algorithm, whose backoff is superpolynomial and subexponential, is optimal over all monotonic backoff schemes. In addition, we exhibit a simple backoff/backon algorithm, having window sizes that vary nonmonotonically according to a "sawtooth" pattern, that achieves the optimal makespan of Θ(n). We study the online setting using an adversarial queueing model. We define a (λ,T) -stream to be an input stream of packets in which at most n = λT packets arrive during any time interval of size T. In this model, to evaluate a given backoff algorithm (which does not know λ or T), we analyze the worst-case behavior of the algorithm over the class of (λ,T) -streams. Our results for the online setting focus on exponential backoff. We show that for any arrival rate λ, there exists a sufficiently large interval size T such that the throughput goes to 0 for some (λ,T) -stream. Moreover, there exists a sufficiently large constant c such that for any interval size T, if λ â¥ c lg lg n/lg n, the system is unstable in the sense that the arrival rate exceeds the throughput in the worst case. If, on the other hand, we have λ â¤ c/lg n for a sufficiently small constant c, then the system is stable. Surprisingly, the algorithms that guarantee smaller makespans in the batch setting require lower arrival rates to achieve stability than does exponential backoff, but when they are stable, they have better response times.
