5|$|Basil cultivars are {{cultivated}} {{varieties of}} basil. They {{are used in}} a variety of ways: as culinary herbs, landscape plants, healing herbs, teas, and worship implements. All true <b>basils</b> are species of the genus Ocimum. The genus is particularly diverse, and includes annuals, non-woody perennials and shrubs native to Africa and other tropical and subtropical regions of the Old and New World. Although it is estimated that there are 50 to 150 species of basil, most, but not all, culinary <b>basils</b> are cultivars of O. basilicum, or sweet basil. Some are cultivars of other basil species, and others are hybrids. It is particularly challenging to determine which species a basil belongs to. This is because basil cross-breeds easily, and drawing boundaries between species is particularly difficult. In fact, recent studies have led to reclassification of some portions of the genus.|$|E
25|$|Several other <b>basils,</b> {{including}} some other Ocimum species, are grown {{in many regions}} of Asia. Most of the Asian <b>basils</b> have a clove-like flavor that is, in general, stronger than the Mediterranean <b>basils.</b> The most notable is the holy basil or tulsi, a revered home-grown plant in India and Nepal.|$|E
25|$|Most commercially {{available}} <b>basils</b> are cultivars of sweet basil. There are over 160 named cultivars available, with new ones appearing every year. There {{are also a}} number of species sold. Here are some <b>basils</b> commonly sold in the US.|$|E

25|$|Most culinary and {{ornamental}} <b>basils</b> are cultivars of {{the species}} Ocimum basilicum, but other species are also grown {{and there are many}} hybrids between species. Traditionally a green plant, some varieties, such as 'Purple Delight' have leaves that appear purple.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{varieties}} of Ocimum basilicum, {{as well as}} several related species or species hybrids also called <b>basil.</b> The type used in Italian food is typically called sweet <b>basil</b> (or Genovese <b>basil),</b> as opposed to Thai <b>basil</b> (O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora), lemon <b>basil</b> (O. × citriodorum), and holy <b>basil</b> (Ocimum tenuiflorum), which are used in Asia. While most common varieties of <b>basil</b> are treated as annuals, some are perennial in warm, tropical climates, including holy <b>basil</b> and a cultivar known as [...] "African blue basil".|$|R
2500|$|The most {{commonly}} used Mediterranean basil cultivars are [...] "Genovese", [...] "Purple Ruffles", [...] "Mammoth", [...] "Cinnamon", [...] "Lemon", [...] "Globe", and [...] "African Blue". The Chinese also use fresh or dried <b>basils</b> in soups and other foods. In Taiwan, people add fresh basil leaves to thick soups. They also eat fried chicken with deep-fried basil leaves. Basil ({{most commonly}} Thai basil) is commonly steeped in cream or milk to create an interesting flavor in ice cream or chocolates (such as truffles). The leaves {{are not the only}} part of basil used in culinary applications, the flower buds have a more subtle flavor and they are edible.|$|E
2500|$|The various <b>basils</b> {{have such}} {{different}} scents because the herb {{has a number}} of different essential oils that come together in different proportions for various breeds. The strong clove scent of sweet basil is derived from eugenol, the same chemical as actual cloves. The citrus scent of lemon basil and lime basil reflects their higher portion of citral, which causes this effect in several plants including lemon mint, and of limonene, which gives actual lemon peel its scent. African blue basil has a strong camphor smell because it contains camphor and camphene in higher proportions. Licorice basil contains anethole, the same chemical that makes anise smell like licorice, and in fact is sometimes called [...] "anise basil." ...|$|E

50|$|Three {{types of}} <b>basil</b> are {{commonly}} used in Thai cuisine. First, Thai <b>basil,</b> or horapha (โหระพา), is widely used throughout Southeast Asia and plays {{a prominent role in}} Vietnamese cuisine. It is also the cultivar most often used for Asian cooking in Western kitchens. Second, holy <b>basil</b> (O. tenuiflorum), or kaphrao (กะเพรา), which has a spicy, peppery, clove-like taste, may be the <b>basil</b> Thai people love most. Holy <b>basil</b> is also known as Thai holy <b>basil</b> or by its Indian name, tulasi or tulsi; it is widely used in India for culinary, medicinal, and religious purposes. Finally, lemon <b>basil</b> (O. × citriodorum), or maenglak (แมงลัก), as its name implies, has undertones of lemon in both scent and taste. Lemon <b>basil</b> is the least commonly used type of <b>basil</b> in Thailand. It is also known as Thai lemon <b>basil,</b> in contradistinction to Mrs. Burns lemon <b>basil,</b> another cultivar of <b>basil.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... [5] [...] "I {{was unable}} to resist the weight of {{historical}} evidence, that within the same period most of the loading doctrines of Popery were already introduced in theory and practice; nor was my conclusion absurd, that miracles are the test of truth, and that the Church must be orthodox and pure, which was so often approved by the visible interposition of the Deity. The marvellous tales which are so boldly attested by the <b>Basils</b> and Chrysostoms, the Austins and Jeroms, compelled me to embrace the superior merits of celibacy, {{the institution of the}} monastic life, the use of the sign of the cross, of holy oil, and even of images, the invocation of saints, the worship of relics, the rudiments of purgatory in prayers for the dead, and the tremendous mystery of the sacrifice of the body and blood of Christ, which insensibly swelled into the prodigy of transubstantiation. In these dispositions, and already more than half a convert, I formed an unlucky intimacy with a young gentleman of our college, whose name I shall spare. With a character less resolute, Mr. ---- had imbibed the same religious opinions; and some Popish books, I know not through what channel, were conveyed into his possession. I read, I applauded, I believed; the English translations of two famous works of Bossuet, Bishop of Meaux, the 'Exposition of the Catholic Doctrine,' and the 'History of the Protestant Variations,' achieved my conversion; and I surely fell by a noble hand. I have since examined the originals with a more discerning eye, and shall not hesitate to pronounce, that Bossuet is indeed a master of all the weapons of controversy. In the 'Exposition,' a specious apology, the orator assumes, with consummate art, the tone of candour and simplicity; and the ten-horned monster is transformed, at his magic touch, into the milk-white Hind, who must be loved as soon as she is seen. In the 'History,' a bold and well-aimed attack, he displays, with a happy mixture of narrative and argument, the faults and follies, the changes and contradictions of our first reformers: whose variations (as he dexterously contends) are the mark of historical error, while the perpetual unity of the Catholic Church is the sign and test of infallible truth. To my present feelings, it seems incredible, that I should ever believe that I believed in transubstantiation. But my conqueror oppressed me with the sacramental words, 'Hoc est corpus meum,' and dashed against each other the figurative half-meanings of the Protestant sects; every objection was resolved into omnipotence; and, after repeating at St. Mary's the Athanasian creed, I humbly acquiesced in the mystery of the real presence.|$|E
