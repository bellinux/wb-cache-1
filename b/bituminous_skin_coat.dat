60|$|He heard {{steps in}} the passage and looked up with some {{surprise}} as two men entered his office. Their bronzed faces and their cheap <b>skin</b> <b>coats</b> suggested that they worked upon the land, {{but there was something}} in the expression and bearing of the taller man that contradicted this. Davies was a judge of character, and he read that something as a sense of power.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy {{fastened}} his <b>skin</b> <b>coat,</b> {{and going}} {{to the door of the}} section-man's hut, looked up the track. The railroad and an angry river occupied the bottom of the gorge, but the water was low and a rapid throbbed on a dull note. Jimmy knew its slack beat was ominous; the frost had stopped the streams that not long since leaped out from the glaciers.|$|R
60|$|It {{was some}} time before Captain Smith could make him {{understand}} {{that it was a}} great honor which was being done him, but when he did get it through his head, he took off his old moccasins and brought from the hut his raccoon <b>skin</b> <b>coat,</b> with orders that my master and Captain Newport send them all to King James in London, as a present from the great Powhatan of Virginia.|$|R

40|$|Hot-spot and {{puncture}} ignition of fuel vapors by simulated lightning discharges was studied experimentally. The {{influences of}} <b>skin</b> <b>coating,</b> <b>skin</b> structure, discharge polarity, skin thickness, discharge current level, and current duration were measured and interpreted. Ignition thresholds are reported for titanium alloy constructed as sheets, sheets coated with sealants, and sandwich skins. Results {{indicated that the}} ignition threshold charge transfer for coated sheets, honeycomb, and truss skins is respectively about 200 %, 400 %, 800 % that of bare alloy sheet of. 102 cm (. 040 in.) -thickness. It was found that hot-spot ignition can occur well after termination of the arc, and that sandwich materials allow ignition only if punctured...|$|R

60|$|Sproatly took {{a bundle}} of papers {{out of his pocket}} and laid them on the table.

He wore a traditional Booka - a kangaroo <b>skin</b> <b>coat</b> with feathers from a red-tailed black cockatoo, signifying a leadership role in Noongar culture. The cloak had been presented to him by Noongar elders. He made his maiden speech to the Parliament on 29 September and received a standing ovation from both the government and opposition benches {{as well as from the}} public galleries.|$|R

60|$|By and bye Sproatly took {{a bundle}} of papers {{out of his pocket}} and laid them on the table. There had been a {{remarkable}} change in his appearance of late, for he now wore store clothes, and the <b>skin</b> <b>coat</b> he had taken off when he came in was, as his hostess had noticed, a new one. It occurred to her that there was a certain significance in this, though Sproatly had changed his occupation some little time ago, and now drove about the prairie on behalf of certain makers of agricultural implements.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the sun was high, and, {{fastening}} the <b>skin</b> <b>coat</b> round my shoulders {{with a piece of}} string, I trudged on, rejoicing in the first warmth and brightness I had so far found in Canada. But it had its disadvantages, for the snow became unpleasantly soft, and {{it was a relief to}} find that the breeze had stripped the much thinner covering from the first of the swelling rises that rolled back toward the north. Here I halted a few minutes and surveyed my adopted country.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop and {{investigate}} the effect of application of indigenous <b>skin</b> <b>coating</b> materials for kinnow fruit, which surely would have superior effect on shelf stability and an attractive alternate for inedible coatings. Economical and underutilized sources were explored for this purpose. Eight different formulations were developed to check their suitability through various physico-chemical analyses. It was concluded that edible coating prepared from corn starch, stearic acid, jojoba oil and monoglycerides (T 8) was observed best in terms of physico-chemical properties of fruits and significantly increased the shelf life...|$|R

60|$|So I saddled {{the next}} best horse, donned my warmest <b>skin</b> <b>coat,</b> and started for a cold ride across the prairie. The snow was thin and fairly hard--it seldom lies deep about Fairmead; but {{in view of the}} return journey I did not urge the horse, and our sleigh had lost a runner. So when perhaps half the {{distance}} had been traversed a beat of hoofs grew louder behind me, and four horsemen, riding hard, came up. By the jingle of accouterments I knew they were the wardens of the prairie, and half expected what was to follow.|$|R
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, Agatha, who said that she {{must have had a}} cold drive, was {{regarding}} the new arrival with a curiosity she had not expected to feel when she first came in. Miss Creighton, she admitted, was comely, though she was clearly somewhat primitive and crude. The long <b>skin</b> <b>coat</b> she wore hid her figure, but her pose was too virile, and there was a look which puzzled Agatha in her eyes. It was almost openly hostile, and there was a suggestion of triumph in it. Agatha, who could find no possible reason for this, resented it.|$|R
60|$|The shack {{was built}} of logs, notched where they crossed {{at the corners}} and caulked with moss. There was a stone chimney, and a big wood fire snapped on the hearth. Jim sat close to the blaze in a deerhide chair, with his old <b>skin</b> <b>coat</b> hung over the back to keep off the {{stinging}} draughts. He could see the telegraph instrument. His and his comrade's duty was to watch it day and night, because theirs was a bad section and accidents happened. Jake had gone hunting and since the gale outside was freshening Jim wondered why he stopped so long.|$|R
