5000|$|After his son {{graduated}} from Doland's high school, Hubert Humphrey Sr. left Doland {{and opened a}} new drugstore in the larger town of Huron, South Dakota, (population 11,000), where he hoped to improve his fortunes. Because of the family's financial struggles, Humphrey {{had to leave the}} University of Minnesota after just one year. He earned a pharmacist's license from the Capitol College of Pharmacy in Denver, Colorado (completing a two-year licensure program in just six months), and spent the years from 1931 to 1937 helping his father run the family drugstore. Both father and son were innovative businessmen in finding ways to attract customers: [...] "to supplement their business, the Humphreys had become manufacturers...of patent medicines for both hogs and humans. A sign featuring a wooden pig was hung over the drugstore to tell the public about this unusual service. Farmers got the message, and it was Humphrey's that became known as the farmer's drugstore." [...] One biographer noted that [...] "while Hubert Jr. minded the store and stirred the concoctions in the basement, Hubert Sr. went on the road selling 'Humphrey's BTV' (<b>Body</b> <b>Tone</b> Veterinary), a mineral supplement and dewormer for hogs, and 'Humphrey's Chest Oil' and 'Humphrey's Sniffles' for two-legged sufferers." [...] Humphrey himself later wrote that [...] "we made [...] "Humphrey's Sniffles", a substitute for Vick's Nose Drops. I felt ours were better. Vick's used mineral oil, which is not absorbent, and we used a vegetable-oil base, which was. I added benzocaine, a local anesthetic, so that even if the sniffles didn't get better, you felt it less." [...] The various [...] "Humphrey cures...worked well enough and constituted {{an important part of the}} family income...the farmers that bought the medicines were good customers." [...] Over time [...] "Humphrey's Drug Store" [...] became a profitable enterprise and the family again prospered. While living in Huron, Humphrey regularly attended Huron's largest Methodist church and became the scoutmaster of the church's Boy Scout group, Troop 6. He [...] "started basketball games in the church basement...although his scouts had no money for camp in 1931, Hubert found a way in the worst of that summer's dust-storm grit, grasshoppers, and depression to lead an overnight outing." ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To examine {{relationships}} between exercise behaviour, eating-disordered behaviour {{and quality of}} life in a community sample of women. Method: Self-report measures of frequency of exercise, obligatoriness of exercise and motivation for exercise, and of eating disorder psychopathology {{and quality of life}}, were completed by 169 women aged 18 - 45 who engaged in regular exercise. Results: Exercising to improve appearance or <b>body</b> <b>tone,</b> and feelings of guilt following the postponement of exercise, were the exercise variables most strongly associated with elevated levels of eating disorder psychopathology and, in turn, reduced quality of life. There was no association between exercise behaviour and quality of life independent of the effects of eating disorder psychopathology. Conclusions: Operational definitions of excessive exercise might usefully include reference to the use of exercise to improve appearance or <b>body</b> <b>tone</b> and the experience of guilt following postponement of exercise. Inclusion of such information in prevention programmes for eating disorders may also be of benefit.

40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{was conducted}} on the accuracy of predictions of various objective outcomes in the areas of social and clinical psychology from short observations of expressive behavior (under 5 min). The overall effect size (/) for the accuracy of predictions for 38 different results was. 39. Studies using longer periods of behavioral observation did not yield greater predictive accuracy; predictions based on observations under Vi min in length did not differ significantly from predic-tions based on 4 - and 5 -min observations. The type of behavioral channel (such as the face, speech, the <b>body,</b> <b>tone</b> of voice) on which the ratings were based was not related to the accuracy of predic-tions. Accuracy did not vary significantly between behaviors manipulated in a laboratory and more naturally occurring behavior.

The way in which people move, talk, and gesture—their fa-cial expressions, posture, and speech—all contribute to the for-mation of impressions about them.

Three age groups (250 pre-high school students, 109 high school students, and 81 college students) were examined cross-sectionally, and 48 children 11 - 14 years old were examined longitudinally. Decoding of four types of nonverbal cues (face, <b>body,</b> <b>tone,</b> discrepancies) arranged from the most controllable channel to the least controllable (most "leaky") channel, was examined. The analysis of variance and the appropriate contrast (the Linear Trend in Age X Linear Trend in Channel) showed that as age increased, females lost {{more and more of}} their advantage for the more leaky or more covert channels but that they gained more and more of their advantage for the less leaky channels (/> =. 0022).

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} plant extract (EB 1493) obtained from Ipomoea alba, Convolvulaceae over general activity and over toxicity of central nervous system, autonomous nervous system, sensorial and psychomotor systems in mice and in rats. Methods: Acute toxicity assay was done with animals that received different doses of EB 1493, intraperitonealy. For each dose, more than 25 parameters related to central and autonomous nervous systems, sensorial and psychomotor systems were evaluated, as well as LD 50 was determined A multi-dose assay (MDTA) was also performed, in which the animals topically received EB 1493 three times/day in the mouth mucosa, for 11 days, and were evaluated for the same parameters considered in the first assay at day 1, day 2, day 5 and day 11. Results: LD 50 is 2. 19 g/kg, considered harmful.

40|$|Purpose: To {{design and}} develop an {{accommodating}} intraocular lens (IOL) for endocapsular fixation with extended accommodative range {{that can be}} adapted to current standard extracapsular phacoemulsification technique. Methods: Ray tracing analysis and lens design; finite element modeling of biomechanical properties; cadaver eye implantation; initial clinical evaluation. Results: Ray tracing analysis indicated that a dual-optic design with a high plus-power front optic coupled to an optically compensatory minus posterior optic produced greater change in conjugation power of the eye compared to that produced by axial movement of a single-optic IOL, and that magnification effects were unlikely to account for improved near vision. Finite element modeling indicated that the two optics can be linked by spring-loaded haptics that allow anterior and posterior axial displacement of the front optic in response to changes in ciliary <b>body</b> <b>tone</b> and capsular tension. A dual-optic single-piece foldable silicone lens was constructed based on these principles. Subsequent initial clinical evaluation in 24 human eyes after phacoemulsification for cataract indicated mean 3. 22 diopters of accommodation (range, 1 to 5 D) based on defocus curve measurement. Accommodative amplitude evaluation at 1 - and 6 -month follow-up in all eyes indicated that the accommodative range was maintained and that the lens was well tolerated. Conclusions: A dual-optic design increases the accommodative effect of axial optic displacement, with minimal magnification effect. Initial clinical trials suggest that IOLs designed on this principle might provide true pseudophakic accommodation following cataract extraction and lens implantation.

40|$|Abstract only availableExercise as a {{means to}} control weight is common among {{individuals}} with eating disorders. This study will examine the connection between exercise and eating disorder status by comparing a sample of active versus recovered eating disordered patients on various aspects of exercise. All current (n = 46 and former (n = 263 eating disorder patients of the University of Missouri Adolescent Clinic have been contacted for participation, and the current project reports on the preliminary data from 20 study participants. Eating disorder status will be determined based on a diagnostic interview, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Diagnosis (SCID). Exercise data will be collected related to motivations for exercise (Reasons for Exercise Inventory, including motivations of: weight control, fitness, improvement of <b>body</b> <b>tone,</b> health, improvement of overall physical attractiveness, enjoyment, and improvement of mood), typical exercise patterns (amount and intensity), the extent to which guilt is experienced after the postponement of exercise, and cognitions related to exercise. Regarding motivation, we expect that those in the active eating disorder group will score higher on exercise motives related to appearance and weight and lower on the reasons for exercise related to enjoyment and mood improvement. In addition, those in the active group who engage in exercise are hypothesized to report greater guilt after postponement of exercise and greater obsessive thoughts about exercise. Results will be discussed in the context of how reasons for exercise may change as part of recovery from eating disorders, with possible clinical implications for treatment programs explicitly addressing exercise.
