5|$|The {{hierarchy}} of Merina andriana sub-classes {{established in the}} 16th century under Andriamanelo was revised by Andrianampoinimerina, as it had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> Andriamasinavalona. He decreed new rights and responsibilities for the andriana, including the privilege of placing sculptures or images of the voromahery (black kite) on their homes to indicate their noble status.|$|E
5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was that the work that had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath {{also contributed to the}} paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E
5|$|Hibs enjoyed {{great success}} in the period {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} the Second World War, winning three league championships between 1948 and 1952. The club's participation in the (inaugural) 1955–56 European Cup meant that Easter Road became the first British ground to host European Cup football. A record attendance of 65,860 was set by an Edinburgh derby against Hearts played on 2 January 1950. This is also a record for any football match played in Edinburgh. As the fans had been tightly packed on the terraces to achieve this record attendance, the size of the East Terrace was increased further. The club even drew up plans to expand the overall capacity to nearly 100,000. This would have <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> raising each end terrace to the same height as the east side, but these plans were never realised.|$|E

5|$|NY240 {{was first}} {{designated}} in the renumbering of state highways in New York in 1930 from NY39 in Springville to NY18 near downtown Buffalo. The portion between Springville and Ashford was {{a section of}} NY62 and Harlem Road was unnumbered. The section south of CR16 in West Valley was a portion of NY242. NY240 instead used Abbott Road and South Park Avenue to get to Buffalo, which got extended to NY5 in the 1930s. NY240 was realigned south to Ellicottville in the mid-1960s, after numerous bypasses and realignments had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> the State of New York Department of Public Works. NY240 was realigned onto Harlem Road c. 1962. The former alignment to Buffalo is now designated as NY950M, a reference route.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{software}} {{states are}} vulnerable to rowhammer attacks. An attacker thus needs to find right target states in order to utilize rowhammer errors. In practice, {{one of the main}} challenges is in identifying target states. Such typically have <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> domain experts. The mainstream fault tolerance community responded to rowhammer attacks with a systematic methodology which can be used to identify, validate, and evaluate rowhammer attack target states and their exploitability. That work is based on the well-established fault injection-based experimental methodology, and generalized attack target states and found a few practical target states that were previously unknown.|$|E

5|$|Some {{authors have}} dealt with {{comparative}} studies between Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as J.J.M. de Groot, among others. The comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth has <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> several authors such as Martin Aronson, and Toropov & Hansen (2002), who {{believe that they have}} parallels that should not be ignored. In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Taoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang, have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of these religions are similar.|$|E
5|$|The {{infrastructure}} of the town was heavily damaged when the SLA took control of it. Most of the houses were badly damaged and a large water tank had been destroyed, which the SLA accused had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> the LTTE using explosives. According to a senior commander of the SLA, the LTTE had damaged the town's infrastructure to obstruct the advance of the Sri Lankan military. Power supply lines in Kilinochchi had also been damaged.

5|$|Various beetles in the Bostrichoidea {{superfamily}} {{attack the}} dry, seasoned wood used as structural timber in houses {{and to make}} furniture. In most cases, it is the larvae that do the damage; these are invisible from {{the outside of the}} timber, but are chewing away at the wood in the interior of the item. Examples of these are the powderpost beetles, which attack the sapwood of hardwoods, and the furniture beetles, which attacks softwoods, including plywood. The damage has already <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> the time the adult beetles bore their way out, leaving neat round holes behind them. The first that a householder knows about the beetle damage is often when a chair leg breaks off or a piece of structural timber caves in. Prevention is through chemical treatment of the timber prior to its use in construction or in furniture manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Baird {{was criticized}} in late 1999 {{for refusing to}} cancel a five-year {{contract}} that had been signed between his department and the Bermuda-based private firm Andersen Consulting (later Accenture), worth up to $180 million. The contract, signed when Janet Ecker was Community and Social Services minister, entrusted Andersen with providing technological upgrades to the province's welfare management system. The arrangement was criticized by Auditor General Erik Peters, who observed {{that there was nothing}} in the contract to prevent Andersen from increasing its hourly rates. A published report in early 2000 indicated that Andersen was charging an average of $257 per hour for work that had previously <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> ministry staff at $51 per hour. Another report indicated that the firm had charged a total of $55 million to find roughly $66 million worth of savings. In response to opposition questions, Baird said that he would not terminate the contract but would endeavour to negotiate a lower rate. Baird opposed the Harris government's plan to amalgamate the city of Ottawa with neighboring municipalities, which was approved by the legislature in 1999.|$|E
5|$|On 21 May 1956, a B-52B (52-0013) {{dropped a}} Mk-15 nuclear bomb over the Bikini Atoll {{in a test}} code-named Cherokee. It was the first air-dropped {{thermonuclear}} weapon. From 24 to 25 November 1956, four B-52Bs of the 93rd BW and four B-52Cs of the 42nd BW flew nonstop {{around the perimeter of}} North America in Operation Quick Kick, which covered 15,530miles (13,500nmi, 25,000km) in 31 hours, 30 minutes. SAC noted the flight time could have been reduced by 5 to 6 hours had the four inflight refuelings <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> fast jet-powered tanker aircraft rather than propeller-driven Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighters. In a demonstration of the B-52's global reach, from 16 to 18 January 1957, three B-52Bs made a non-stop flight around the world during Operation Power Flite, during which 24,325miles (21,145nmi, 39,165km) was covered in 45 hours 19 minutes (536.8 smph) with several in-flight refuelings by KC-97s.|$|E

5|$|There were {{numerous}} reports in southern Mississippi of embedded tornadoes that exacerbated the hurricane's effects. Reports in Gulfport indicated that three schools actively {{being used as}} hurricane shelters were struck and damaged by tornadoes. At one location, almost 400 people being housed in a school had to rush to safety before part of its roof collapsed. Another apparent tornado sideswiped a senior citizens' center, endangering nearly 200 people in a structure that sustained damage to windows, doors, and part of its roof; about 20 people required rescue by paramedics. Only minor injuries occurred {{in association with the}} possible tornadoes. Teams of experts tasked with reviewing the validity of tornado reports were largely unable to prove that {{a significant portion of the}} damage in southern Mississippi had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> tornadoes. As a result, few tornadoes were confirmed, and it is likely that most of the damage in the region resulted from squall-like winds that are part of an intense hurricane's nature, or potentially localized microbursts. Any unconfirmed tornadoes would have been no stronger than the hurricane's synoptic winds.|$|E
5|$|They {{pitched a}} number of live-action ideas to Kanbar and {{proposed}} that he invest in a development division of their company, paying them and covering their rent {{in exchange for a}} significant portion of the rights to any scripts that they might sell. Kanbar however, was interested in a more direct approach, and preferred to focus on trying to produce a single film. He had always been a great admirer of animation and was impressed after being shown a direct-to-DVD computer-animated short film that Cory had made called Wobots. He suggested the possibility of producing an animated feature with them that would tell a familiar story with a twist, and gave them a month to come up with a story idea. Kanbar had expressed interest in Cinderella or Pinocchio, but the Edwards brothers did not like these ideas as they had already <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> Walt Disney. A few days after the brothers' initial meeting with Kanbar, Todd found inspiration in non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon, Pulp Fiction, Run Lola Run, and Memento and came up with the idea of telling the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood as a police investigation, using multiple points of view.|$|E
5|$|For the {{technical}} crew members, the film's human characters posed a difficult set of challenges. Bird's story {{was filled with}} elements that were difficult to animate with CGI back then. Humans are widely {{considered to be the}} most difficult things to execute in animation. Pixar's animators filmed themselves walking to better grasp proper human motion. Creating an all-human cast required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Although {{the technical}} team had some experience with hair and cloth in Monsters, Inc. (2001), the amount of hair and cloth required for The Incredibles had never <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> Pixar until this point. Moreover, Bird would tolerate no compromises for the sake of technical simplicity. Where the technical team on Monsters, Inc. had persuaded director Pete Docter to accept pigtails on Boo to make her hair easier to animate, the character of Violet had to have long hair that obscured her face; it was integral to her character. Violet's long hair, which was extremely difficult to animate, was only successfully animated toward the end of production. In addition, animators had to adapt to having hair underwater and blowing through the wind. Disney was initially reluctant to make the film because of these issues, feeling a live-action film would be preferable, though Lasseter vetoed this.|$|E
