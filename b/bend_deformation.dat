40|$|Curved crystal, {{focusing}} monochromators featuring cubed-root thickness profiles typically employ side-clamped cooling {{to reduce}} thermally induced overall <b>bend</b> <b>deformation</b> of the crystal. While performance is improved, residual <b>bend</b> <b>deformation</b> {{is often an}} important limiting factor in the monochromator performance. A slightly asymmetric “I-beam ” crystal cross section with cubed-root flange profiles has been developed to further reduce this effect. Physical motivation, finite-element modeling evaluation and performance characteristics of this design are discussed. Reduction of high mounting stress at the fixed end of the crystal required the soldering of an Invar support fixture to the crystal.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to character skinning where divergence-free vector fields induced by skeletal motion, describe the velocity of skin deformation. The joint transformations for a pose relative to a rest pose create a <b>bend</b> <b>deformation</b> field, resulting in pose-dependent or kinematic skin deformations, varying smoothly across joints. The <b>bend</b> <b>deformation</b> parameters are interactively controlled to capture the varying deformability of bone and other anatomic tissue within an overall fold-over free and volume-preserving skin deformation. Subsequently, we represent the dynamics of skeletal motion, tissue elasticity, muscular tension and the environment as forces that are mapped to vortices at tissue interfaces. A simplified Biot-Savart law in the context of elastic deformation recovers a divergence-free velocity field from the vorticity. Finally, we apply a new stable technique to efficiently integrate points along their deformation trajectories. Adding these dynamic forces over a window of time prior to a given pose provides a continuum of user controllable kinodynamic skinning. A comprehensive implementation using a typical animator workflow in Maya shows our approach to be effective for complex character skinning...|$|E

The maximum torque-induced <b>bending</b> <b>deformation</b> in ball screw systems with certain parameters is solved by modeling the ball screw as a simple Euler–Bernoulli beam. On {{the basis of the}} model, the general expression of maximum deformation of ball screw systems in terms of uncertain parameters is derived based on the second-order Taylor series expansion. Then the problem of determining bounds of the maximum deformation of uncertain systems is transformed into a series of box constrained quadratic programming problems. Box constrained quadratic programming problems are solved by difference of convex functions algorithm. The effectiveness of the analysis is validated by Monte Carlo simulation method. Through demonstration, the conclusion can be drawn that the torque-induced <b>bending</b> <b>deformation</b> in ball screw systems with uncertain-but-bounded parameters can be analyzed explicitly by the numerical method combined second-order Taylor series expansion with difference of convex functions algorithm, which offers a new approach for estimating the torque-induced <b>bending</b> <b>deformation</b> in ball screw systems...|$|R

Here, {{in the framework of}} a second-virial density functional theory, we have developed a general approach, relaxing the usual assumption that the angular distribution of particles with respect to their local director is unaffected by the deformation. We show that, for particles with polar symmetry, a new contribution to the splay and <b>bend</b> <b>deformation</b> free energy arises, associated with the onset of polar order. Calculations for conical and bent-shaped particles reveal dramatic softening of the splay and the bend mode, respectively, which eventually may lead to spontaneous deformation...|$|E

Because of the unusually small twist elastic modulus of the nematic phase of LCLCs, droplets of this phase exhibit a twisted bipolar configuration with remarkably large chiral symmetry breaking. Further, the hexagonal ordering of columns and the resultant strong suppression of twist and splay but not <b>bend</b> <b>deformation</b> in the columnar phase, cause droplets of this phase to adopt a concentric director configuration around a central bend disclination line and, at sufficiently high mesogen concentration, to exhibit surface faceting.

We find spontaneous chirality: despite the achiral nature of nematics the director configuration show a handedness if the toroid is thick enough. In the chiral state the director field displays a double twist, {{whereas in the}} achiral state there is only <b>bend</b> <b>deformation.</b> The critical thickness increases as {{the difference between the}} twist and saddle-splay moduli grows. A positive saddle-splay modulus prefers alignment along the short circle of the bounding torus, and hence stimulates promotes a chiral configuration. The chiral-achiral transition mimics the order-disorder transition of the mean-field Ising model. The role of the magnetisation in the Ising model is played by the degree of twist. The role of the temperature is played by the aspect ratio of the torus. Remarkably, an external field does not break the chiral symmetry explicitly, but shifts the transition.
