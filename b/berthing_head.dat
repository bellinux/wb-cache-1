5000|$|Woodman then {{launched}} a program affiliation on the Internet called [...] "Spider-Cash", to distribute its {{films in the}} form of video sequences, after <b>Berth</b> Milton, <b>head</b> of Private, asked Woodman to return to work for him in 2005.|$|R
60|$|Lister went, {{and soon}} after a porter helped him into his <b>berth.</b> His <b>head</b> hurt and he felt very dull and slack, but he slept and when he woke bright {{sunshine}} streamed into the standing car {{and he saw the}} train had stopped at Winnipeg. Soon afterwards the conductor and one of the station officials put him into an automobile.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} and {{as mentioned}} earlier, {{there were some}} single engine variants offered by Corvette Cruisers in the 1980s but these are very rare. There is also one Corvette which has a retro-fitted extended bulbous bow, presumably to extend the waterline length to help efficiency. Some owners have also made very large changes to the accommodation, including one where the whole forward <b>berth</b> and <b>heads</b> were converted to form a galley and the saloon then extended to form more seating.|$|R
50|$|A Walkaround boat is a {{cross between}} a center console and a cuddy boat or express. Like a center console boat, it is mostly used for fishing and has a full length primary deck or cockpit but also has a small cabin (cuddy) for <b>berths</b> and a <b>head</b> {{in the center of the}} boat in front of the console.|$|R
6000|$|Aileen {{therefore}} {{remained on}} deck {{for some time}} with her father, but poor Miss Pritty, on the first intimation that more pirates were in sight, got up hastily, staggered with a face expressive of the utmost horror into the cabin, flung herself into the captain's <b>berth,</b> thrust her <b>head</b> under the pillow, piled the clothes over that, and lay there-- quaking! ...|$|R
50|$|In 2001, the {{original}} Blitz {{was owned by}} Casey Wasserman, owner of the Arena Football League (AFL) team the Los Angeles Avengers. He owned and managed the team for two seasons. During their Inaugural season the team captured a Western Division title and a playoff <b>berth.</b> The <b>head</b> coach for the team was announced on December 7, 2001. Head coach James Fuller originally came out of Portland State into the NFL where he played for the 1992-1994 San Diego Chargers and the Philadelphia Eagles in 1996-97 as a defensive back. He was {{head coach of the}} Bakersfield Blitz during their 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons. He went on from his time with the Blitz to become the head coach for the AFL team Philadelphia Soul owned by Jon Bon Jovi.|$|R
50|$|He was {{the head}} coach of the Cardinals in 1996 and succeeded Buddy Ryan again. His one winning season and playoff <b>berth</b> as a <b>head</b> coach came in 1998 where the club posted a 9-7 record. He then coached the Cardinals to their first playoff win in 50 years during the 1998 season by {{defeating}} the 3rd-seeded Dallas Cowboys. The team lost the next week to the 1st-seeded Minnesota Vikings. After 7 games into the 2000 season, Tobin was fired after posting a 2-5 record. His record in Arizona was 28-43, with a 1-1 post season record.|$|R
60|$|He {{was always}} in a brown study; {{sometimes}} sitting on the quarter-deck with arms folded, and head hanging upon his chest. Then he would rise, and gaze out to windward, {{as if he had}} suddenly discovered a friend. But looking disappointed, would retire slowly into his state-room, where you could see him through the little window, in an irregular sitting position, with the back part of him inserted into his <b>berth,</b> and his <b>head,</b> arms, and legs hanging out, buried in profound meditation, with his fore-finger aside of his nose. He never was seen reading; never took a hand at cards; never smoked; never drank wine; never conversed; and never staid to the dessert at dinner-time.|$|R
50|$|MTV Networks Europe {{announced}} {{the introduction of}} a non-stop music channel in January 2011. As the main MTV brand has deviated from its original purpose and increased competition from other music channels and online services, MTV addressed this issue by launching a new music channel MTV Music. The channel launched on 1 February 2011 in both the United Kingdom and Ireland. The channel replaced MTV Shows. On the date of MTV Shows' closure and MTV Music's launch, MTV moved up the Sky programme guide from its long-held <b>berth</b> at the <b>head</b> of the Music section to the Entertainment guide; in return the MTV Shows broadcast capacity moved down from the Entertainment section {{to take the place of}} MTV in the Music guide, becoming MTV Music.|$|R
6000|$|The noise increased. Little Belfast seemed, in {{the heavy}} heat of the forecastle, to boil with facetious fury. His eyes danced; in the crimson of his face, comical as a mask, the mouth yawned black, with strange grimaces. Facing him, a half-undressed man held his sides, and, {{throwing}} his head back, laughed with wet eyelashes. Others stared with amazed eyes. Men sitting doubled up in the upper bunks smoked short pipes, swinging bare brown feet above the heads of those who, sprawling below on sea-chests, listened, smiling stupidly or scornfully. Over the white rims of <b>berths</b> stuck out <b>heads</b> with blinking eyes; but the bodies {{were lost in the}} gloom of those places, that resembled narrow niches for coffins in a whitewashed and lighted mortuary. Voices buzzed louder. Archie, with compressed lips, drew himself in, seemed to shrink into a smaller space, and sewed steadily, industrious and dumb. Belfast shrieked like an inspired Dervish:--"... So I seez to him, boys, seez I, 'Beggin' yer pardon, sorr,' seez I to that second mate of that steamer--'beggin' your-r-r pardon, sorr, the Board of Trade must 'ave been drunk when they granted you your certificate!' 'What do you say, you------!' seez he, comin' at me like a mad bull... all in his white clothes; and I up with my tar-pot and capsizes it all over his blamed lovely face and his lovely jacket.... 'Take that!' seez I. 'I am a sailor, anyhow, you nosing, skipper-licking, useless, sooperfloos bridge-stanchion, you! That's the kind of man I am!' shouts I.... You should have seed him skip, boys! Drowned, blind with tar, he was! So..." ...|$|R
