500|$|After {{the debut}} of the first {{stretched}} 767s, Boeing sought to address airline requests for greater capacity by proposing larger models, including a partial double-deck version informally named the [...] "Hunchback of Mukilteo" [...] (from a town near Boeing's Everett factory) with a 757 <b>body</b> <b>section</b> mounted over the aft main fuselage. In 1986, Boeing proposed the 767-X, a revised model with extended wings and a wider cabin, but received little interest. By 1988, the 767-X had evolved into an all-new twinjet, which revived the 777 designation. Until the 777's 1995 debut, the 767-300 and 767-300ER remained Boeing's second-largest wide-bodies behind the 747.|$|E

2500|$|Don Yenko, who {{had been}} racing Corvettes, could not compete {{successfully}} against the Carroll Shelby Mustangs after they arrived on the scene; he therefore decided to race modified Corvairs, beginning with the 1966 model. As the stock Corvair did not fit {{into any of the}} SCCA categories, Yenko had to modify four-carburetor Corsas into [...] "sports cars" [...] by removing the back seat; in the process he introduced various performance improvements. As the SCCA required 100 cars to be manufactured to homologate the model for production racing, Yenko completed 100 Stingers in one month in 1965. Although all were white, as the SCCA required for American cars at the time, [...] {{there was a great deal}} of variety between individual cars; some had exterior modifications including fiberglass engine covers with spoilers, some did not; some received engine upgrades developing 160, 190, 220, or 240hp (119, 142, 164, or 179kW). All were equipped by the Chevrolet factory with heavy duty suspension, four speed transmission, quicker steering ratio, [...] "positraction" [...] limited-slip differentials (50 with 3.89 gears, and 50 with 3.55 when Chevrolet dropped the 3.89) and dual brake master cylinders (the first application of this by Chevrolet, to become stock equipment the next year).
