5000|$|Balsam of Peru {{contains}} 25 or {{so different}} substances, including cinnamein, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl <b>cinnamate,</b> <b>benzyl</b> benzoate, benzoic acid, and vanillin. [...] It also contains cinnamic acid alcohol and aldehyde, farnesol, and nerolidol. A minority of it, approximately 30-40%, contains resins or esters of unknown composition.|$|R
40|$|What is Balsam of Peru {{and where}} is it found? Balsam of Peru is a sticky {{aromatic}} liquid that comes from cutting the bark of the tree Myroxolon balsamum, a tree that is native to El Salvador. The "Peru " part of Balsam of Peru originates from {{when it was first}} named, El Salvador then being part of a Peruvian colony. Balsam of Peru smells of vanilla and cinnamon because it contains 60 - 70 % cinnamein (a combination of cinnamic acid, cinnamyl <b>cinnamate,</b> <b>benzyl</b> benzoate, benzoic acid and vanillin). The other 30 - 40 % contains resins of unknown composition. It also contains essential oils similar to those in citrus fruit peel. These are all potential allergens. Balsam of Peru is not only used for its aromatic and fixative (i. e. delays evaporation) properties but also for its mild antibacterial, antifungal and antiparasitic attributes. It has 3 main uses: fragrance in perfumes and toiletries; flavouring in food and drink; healing properties in medicinal products. The table below lists some of the products that may contain Balsam of Peru and/or chemically related substances...|$|R
50|$|<b>Benzyl</b> <b>cinnamate</b> can be {{prepared}} by heating benzyl chloride and excess sodium cinnamate in water to 100-115 °C or by heating sodium cinnamate with an excess of benzyl chloride {{in the presence of}} diethylamine.|$|E
50|$|Various {{antibacterial}} chemical {{extracts from}} various {{species of the}} Sweetgum tree, (genus Liquidambar) have been investigated for their activity in inhibiting MRSA. Specifically these are: cinnamic acid, cinnamyl cinnamate, ethyl cinnamate, <b>benzyl</b> <b>cinnamate,</b> styrene, vanillin, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-phenylpropyl alcohol, 3-phenylpropyl cinnamate, and vanillin.|$|E
50|$|It is tapped {{from the}} living trunks of Myroxylon balsamum (see Myroxylon). It is a brownish, sticky, semisolid mass. An {{essential}} oil is also distilled from the balsam. The balsam contains a fairly large amount of benzyl and cinnamyl esters of benzoic and cinnamic acid (benzyl benzoate, <b>benzyl</b> <b>cinnamate).</b>|$|E
50|$|Purified storax {{contains}} circa 33 to 50% storesin, {{an alcoholic}} resin, both free and as cinnamic esters. Contains 5 to 15% cinnamic acid, 5 to 15% cinnamyl cinnamate, circa 10% phenylpropyl cinnamate; {{small amounts of}} ethyl cinnamate, <b>benzyl</b> <b>cinnamate,</b> and styrene, Some may contain traces of vanillin. Some sources report a resin containing triterpenic acids (oleanolic and 3-epioleanolic acids).|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{chemical}} composition of fatty acids and unsaponifiable fraction of leaves, stems and roots of Arbutus unedo L. were determined using gas chromatography and gas chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. Then fatty acid fractions of the leaves, stems and roots contained 38. 5 %, 31. 32 % and 14. 1 % palmitic acid respectively, {{along with other}} long chain fatty acids (up to C 22). The {{chemical composition}} of the unsaponifiable fractions differed: the leaf and stem fractions contained high levels of aliphatic (32. 1 % and 62. 6 %, respectively) and terpenic compounds (49. 6 % and 25. 7 %, respectively), and the root fraction mainly contained esters, of which the most aboundant was <b>benzyl</b> <b>cinnamate</b> (36. 6 %). The antimicrobial activities of the unsaponifiable fractions against nine species of microorganismes were assessed. The unsaponifiable leaf and stem extracts inhibited the growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enteroccocus faecalis and Candida albicans...|$|E
40|$|The {{removal and}} {{transformation}} of 15 common fragrance allergens and two polycyclic musks in water samples were studied using UV irradiation and chlorination treatments. The {{monitoring of the}} reaction {{was carried out by}} a HS-SPME method coupled to GC-MS analysis. Different behaviours were observed depending on the compound and the treatment applied. Elimination experiments showed that all target compounds were affected by {{at least one of the}} two treatments. A total of 15 UV transformation products were detected and chemical structures were proposed for five of them. In the chlorination experiments, only galaxolide and <b>benzyl</b> <b>cinnamate</b> transformation products were observedA.

40|$|The European {{legislation}} {{on cosmetic products}} has recently required the declaration of 26 compounds (24 volatile chemicals and 2 natural extracts) on the label of final products when exceeding a stipulated cut-off level. In this work a rapid reliable and specific RP-HPLC method coupled with diode array detector (DAD) has been developed for the simultaneous determination and quantification of the 24 volatile chemicals: amyl cinnamal, benzyl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol, citral, eugenol, hydroxy-citronellal, isoeugenol, amylcinnamyl alcohol, benzyl salicylate, cinnamal, coumarin, geraniol, Lyral (hydroxy-methylpentylcyclohexene carboxaldehyde), anisyl alcohol, <b>benzyl</b> <b>cinnamate,</b> farnesol, Lilial (2 -(4 -tert-butylbenzyl) propionaldehyde) linalool, benzyl benzoate, citronellol, hexyl cinnamal, limonene, methylheptin carbonate, alpha-isomethyl ionone (3 -methyl- 4 -(2, 6, 6 -trimethyl- 2 -cyclohexen- 1 -yl) - 3 -buten- 2 -one). The 24 analytes were appropriately separated over a running time of 40 min, on a C 18 column using a simple gradient elution (acetonitrile/water) with flow rate from 0. 7 to 1. 0 ml/min and UV acquisition at 210, 254 and 280 nm. All calibration curves showed good linearity (r 2 > 0. 99) within test ranges. The method was successfully applied to the qualitative and quantitative determination of the potential allergens in four commercial scented products, with satisfactory accuracy and precision. The results indicated that this simple and efficient method {{can be used for}} quality assessment of complex matrices such us cosmetic scented products...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{novel and}} {{efficient}} method based on headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME), followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), {{was developed for}} the analysis of propolis volatile compounds. The HS-SPME procedure, whose experimental parameters were properly optimized, was carried out using a 100. μm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber. The GC-MS analyses were performed on a HP- 5 MS cross-linked 5 % diphenyl- 95 % dimethyl polysiloxane capillary column (30 m × 0. 25 mm I. D., 1. 00 μm film thickness), under programmed-temperature elution. Ninety-nine constituents were identified using this technique in the samples of raw propolis collected from different Italian regions. The main compounds detected include benzoic acid (0. 87 - 30. 13 %) and its esters, such as benzyl benzoate (0. 16 - 13. 05 %), benzyl salicylate (0. 34 - 1. 90 %) and <b>benzyl</b> <b>cinnamate</b> (0. 34 - 3. 20 %). Vanillin was detected in most of the samples analyzed in this study (0. 07 - 5. 44 %). Another relevant class of volatile constituents is represented by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, such as δ-cadinene (1. 29 - 13. 31 %), γ-cadinene (1. 36 - 8. 85 %) and α-muurolene (0. 78 - 6. 59 %), and oxygenated sesquiterpenes, such as β-eudesmol (2. 33 - 12. 83 %), T-cadinol (2. 73 - 9. 95 %) and α-cadinol (4. 84 - 9. 74 %). Regarding monoterpene hydrocarbons, they were found to be present at low level in the samples analyzed in this study, {{with the exception of one}} sample from Southern Italy, where α-pinene was the most abundant constituent (13. 19 %). The results obtained by HS-SPME-GC-MS were also compared with those of hydrodistillation (HD) coupled with GC-MS. The HS-SPME-GC-MS method developed in this study allowed us to determine the chemical fingerprint of propolis volatile constituents, thus providing a new and reliable tool for the complete characterization of this biologically active apiary product...|$|E
