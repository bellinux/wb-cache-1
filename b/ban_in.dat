5|$|In Multani v. Marguerite-Bourgeoys (Commission scolaire) (2006), {{the issue}} was whether a <b>ban</b> <b>in</b> a public school on Sikh {{students}} carrying kirpans (ceremonial daggers) for religious purposes was justifiable.

5|$|Buddhist discontent erupted {{following}} a <b>ban</b> <b>in</b> early May on flying the Buddhist flag in Huế on Vesak, {{the birthday of}} Gautama Buddha.

A large crowd of Buddhists protested the ban, defying the government by flying Buddhist flags on the Buddhist holy day of Vesak and marching on the government broadcasting station. Government forces fired into the crowd of protesters, killing nine people. Diệm's refusal to take responsibility — he blamed the Viet Cong for the deaths — led to further Buddhist protests and calls for religious equality.

In meetings prior to the negotiations, Kennedy informed Harriman that he would be willing to make concessions on the Berlin question.|$|E
