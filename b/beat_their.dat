He also played in the second leg the following week and assisted Patrick Cutrone's goal from the set piece as Milan <b>beat</b> <b>their</b> opponent 2–0. Rodríguez made his Serie A debut in a 3–0 home victory against Crotone on 21 August, and his first league goal came from a penalty kick in a 2–0 win against SPAL at the San Siro on 20 September.|$|E
5|$|Teams {{representing}} England {{have played}} international matches at St Andrew's, though not at senior level. In 1957, England B defeated Scotland B under floodlights {{in front of}} nearly 40,000 spectators. England's junior sides have played there on several occasions, at under-23, under-21– the 4–0 defeat to Spain in 2001 was the England under-21 team's worst home defeat– and youth levels. Before competitive football resumed after the First World War, a Scottish Football League XI <b>beat</b> <b>their</b> English counterparts, including Birmingham players Frank Womack and Billy Morgan, 3–1 at St Andrew's.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} various {{methods of}} serving and returning the ball, designed for players to <b>beat</b> <b>their</b> opponent. Players can {{compete against the}} game's artificial intelligence, while the game's multiplayer mode lets two players compete in matches, either through local multiplayer or online. Initially developed specifically for the Xbox 360 console, the development team {{took advantage of the}} hardware's graphical power, allowing the game to play at a faster pace than with previous hardware. The game was the first to be developed using Rockstar's proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine, later used in games such as Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemption.|$|E

5|$|After {{experiencing}} {{chest pains}} following the team's 27–17 {{victory over the}} New Orleans Saints on December 13, Reeves underwent quadruple bypass surgery. The team was coached by defensive coordinator Rich Brooks for the final two regular season games. Reeves was {{able to return to}} the team in time for their first playoff game, in which the Falcons <b>beat</b> <b>their</b> division rival, the San Francisco 49ers, to clinch a spot in the Conference Championship. Despite an impressive season, they were not expected to match up well against the Vikings, who had beaten teams by an average of 23.22 points at home that year and were installed as 11-point favorites for the Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|Bees <b>beat</b> <b>their</b> wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not {{contract}} on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second. These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and {{are found in}} the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera. Bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures. Bumblebees have been known to reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30°C (86°F) using this method.|$|E
5|$|Mooney was {{recalled}} {{from his}} loan at Alfreton {{as a result}} of the one-match suspension Olejnik received for his red card. Winfield scored a 73rd-minute header from a Summerfield corner as York <b>beat</b> <b>their</b> relegation rivals Cheltenham 1–0 at home. York moved six points of the relegation zone after drawing 0–0 away to Oxford. Winfield was sent off in the first half of York's 1–0 home win over relegation-threatened Hartlepool, Summerfield scoring the winning goal during the second half with a deflected 30-yard shot. York ensured their safety from relegation after beating Morecambe 2–1 at home, moving 11 points clear of the relegation zone in 18th-place. Morecambe took the lead through Paul Mullin before Zubar converted Summerfield's corner with a far post header, and Penn scored the winning goal with a long-range strike into the top left-hand corner.|$|E

5|$|Shearer did not {{score in}} England's opening 3–2 defeat against Portugal, but did so as England {{defeated}} Germany 1–0 in Charleroi, ensuring that England <b>beat</b> <b>their</b> European neighbours {{for the first}} time since the 1966 World Cup Final. To remain in the tournament, England only required a draw against Romania in the final group match, and Shearer scored a penalty as England went in at half-time 2–1 up, but Romania ultimately won 3–2. England's tournament was over, and so was Shearer's international career. From his 63 caps, he captained the team 34 times and scored thirtygoals; joint-fifth in the England all-time goalscorers list with Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney. Shearer remained in international retirement despite speculation of a return during the 2002 World Cup and 2004 European Championship campaigns, and further declined an offer to be assistant manager to Steve McClaren after the 2006 World Cup – a position ultimately filled by Terry Venables.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 US Open Men's singles final was the {{championship}} tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2010 US Open. It pitted then-world No. 1 Rafael Nadal against then-world No. 3 Novak Djokovic in a Major final {{for the first}} time, having previously met four times at this level (one quarter-final and three semi-finals, all won by Nadal). This was the first US Open final reached by Nadal, having previously fallen in the semi-finals in the previous two years, while for Djokovic, {{this was the first}} Major final he reached since winning his then-only Major title at the 2008 Australian Open. To reach the final, both players had to <b>beat</b> <b>their</b> semi-final opponents in contrasting circumstances: Nadal easily defeated Mikhail Youzhny in straight sets, while Djokovic saved several match points in the fifth set to overcome Roger Federer in five sets, thus denying what would have been the first ever Federer-Nadal final at Flushing Meadows.|$|E
5|$|Variation of {{the wing}} beat may also occur, not just amongst {{different}} species, but even among individuals at different times. In general, the frequency is dependent upon the ratio between the power {{of the wing}} muscles and the resistance of the load. Large-winged, light-bodied butterflies may have a wing beat frequency of 4–20 per second whereas small-winged, heavy-bodied flies and bees <b>beat</b> <b>their</b> wings more than 100 times a second and mosquitoes can beat up to 988–1046 times a second. The same goes for flight; though it is generally difficult to estimate the speed of insects in flight, most insects can probably fly faster in nature than they do in controlled experiments.|$|E

5|$|Hitting a {{consistent}} goalscoring form during mid-season, Villa scored against Deportivo La Coruña, {{although he was}} sent off during the match after his second yellow card, received due to a foul on Daniel Aranzubia; as a result, he missed Valencia's next match against Real Valladolid, a game Valencia lost 2–1 at home. Ready to return from suspension, Villa suffered from an inflammation in the joint in his left knee due to a partial dislocation and would be ruled out for the next 15 days, missing games against Numancia, Recreativo de Huelva and Racing de Santander. When he finally returned from injury on 5 April 2009, he had no trouble recovering form, netting a brace in a match against Getafe which Valencia won 4–1. On 12 April, Villa was set to return to El Molinón, the home ground of Sporting de Gijón where he started his career. He admitted that the encounter would be very emotional for him but went on to score the second Valencia goal in a 3–2 win and kept a pre-match promise by not celebrating the goal. His goal against Villarreal brought his tally to 26, and he then scored another two against Athletic Bilbao, finishing with 28 goals after the last game of the season, thus equalling records set by the Argentinian Mario Kempes and the Montenegrin Predrag Mijatović, who also scored 28 goals in a Valencia shirt in 1978 and 1996, respectively. Kempes reached his tally of 28 goals in 34 games while Mijatović achieved it in 40, ultimately seeing Villa <b>beat</b> <b>their</b> percentages, as he achieved the 28 goals in 33 games, recording a goal ratio of 0.84 goals per game. That season saw Villa's best goal-scoring season at Valencia.|$|E

25|$|Insects that <b>beat</b> <b>their</b> wings {{less than}} one hundred times a second use {{synchronous}} muscle. A Synchronous muscle {{is a type of}} muscle that contracts once for every nerve impulse, which is more efficient for fast flight. Insects that <b>beat</b> <b>their</b> wings more rapidly, such as the bumblebee, use asynchronous muscle; this is a type of muscle that contracts more than once per nerve impulse. This is achieved by the muscle being stimulated to contract again by a release in tension in the muscle, which can happen more rapidly than through simple nerve stimulation alone.|$|E
