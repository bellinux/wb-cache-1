40|$|Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) is a phase {{contrast}} imaging technique to quantitatively measure the elasticity of tissues. Typically, the oscillating driver {{is placed on}} the surface of objects to generate shear waves. When it is applied to detect tumors in deep location, the depth penetration of the wave is limited by attenuation and the biopsy procedure has to be performed separately. In this study, we describe a method using <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle</b> as the MRE driver to produce shear waves in tissues. We made comparison between the MRE acquisitions obtained with <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle</b> and surface drivers.

40|$|International audienceThis article compares four {{different}} <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle</b> localization algorithms in both 3 D and 4 D situations {{to evaluate their}} accuracy and execution time. The localization algorithms were: Principle component analysis (PCA), random Hough transform (RHT), parallel integral projection (PIP) and ROI-RK (ROI based RANSAC and Kalman filter). To enhance the contrast of the <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle</b> and background tissue, a line filtering pre-processing step was implemented. To make the PCA, RHT and PIP algorithms comparable with the ROI-RK method, a region of interest (ROI) strategy was added. Simulated and ex-vivo data were {{used to evaluate the}} performance of the different <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle</b> localization algorithms. The resolutions of the sectorial and cylindrical volumes were 0. 3 mm × 0. 4 mm × 0. 6 mm and 0. 1 mm × 0. 1 mm × 0. 2 mm (axial × lateral × azimuthal) respectively. In so far as the simulation and experimental results show, the ROI-RK method successfully located and tracked the <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle</b> in both 3 D and 4 D situations. The tip localization error was within 1. 5 mm and the axis accuracy was within 1. 6 mm. To the best of our knowledge, considering both localization accuracy and execution time, the ROI-RK was the most stable and time-saving method. Normally, accuracy comes at the expense of time. However, the ROI-RK method was able to locate the <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle</b> with high accuracy in real time, which makes it a promising method for clinical applications...|$|R

40|$|A {{method and}} an {{apparatus}} for three-dimensional ultrasound imaging of a needle-like instrument, {{such as a}} <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle,</b> inserted in a human body. The instrument is visualized by transmitting ultrasound beams toward the instrument and then detecting the echo signals using a linear array of transducer elements. The problem of ultrasound being reflected from a <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle</b> {{in a direction away}} from the transducer array is solved by steering the transmitted ultrasound beams t increase the angle at which the beams impinge upon the <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle.</b> Ideally the ultrasound beams are perpendicular to the needle. This increases the system 2 ̆ 7 s sensitivity to the needle because the reflections from the needle are directed close to the transducer array. This can be accomplished using either the B mode or the color flow mode of an ultrasound imaging system. The acquired data for multiple two-dimensional image frames is gathered in memory to form a data volume, which is then processed to form a three-dimensional image (by projection) or a two-dimensional slice taken at an angle through the data volume. In particular, a two-dimensional slice which is coplanar with inserted <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle</b> can be imaged...|$|R

50|$|An {{injection}} of methylprednisolone acetate into the lesion helps reduce {{the levels of}} prostaglandin. Prostaglandin is a fatty acid that reduces cyst’s ability to be reabsorbed into the bone. To begin an operation using steroids, <b>biopsy</b> <b>needles</b> are placed into the cyst and the interstitial fluids are drained. The cyst is then filled with radiographic contrast to determine the volume {{and shape of the}} cyst. If the cyst can be filled, it will be injected with methylprednisolone acetate in several intervals for a time span of six to twelve months. Once the level of prostaglandin decreases, the cyst will be reabsorbed into the bone and disappear. Treatments using steroid injections are preferred over curettage, but there are few risks from the method, which are limited to infection, fracture, and reappearance of the cyst.|$|E
50|$|After {{the site}} is prepared, the proceduralist injects local {{anaesthetic}} into the skin, through the subcutaneous tissue and down to and around the kidney. There may be a sharp sting as the local anaesthetic is injected. After a few seconds, the site will be numb and only a sensation of pressure should be felt. A small 1-2 mm incision is made to allow insertion of the biopsy needle. In most cases, real-time imaging {{will be used to}} guide positioning of the local anaesthetic and <b>biopsy</b> <b>needles.</b> In the case of blind biopsy, this will not be used. A loud click may be heard as the spring-loaded biopsy needle is fired into the kidney to obtain a tissue sample.

30|$|As an {{alternative}} to CT-guided lung biopsy, CT fluoroscopy {{can be used to}} target lung lesions.

However, both patient and radiologist experience a higher exposure to radiation, which is a significant disadvantage.

40|$|IntroductionIn this study, we {{examined}} whether {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) mutations were detectable using a polymerase chain reaction-based assay and wash fluid of computed tomography (CT) -guided lung <b>biopsy</b> <b>needles.</b> MethodsDNA was extracted from wash fluid of CT-guided <b>biopsy</b> <b>needles</b> of 53 lung tumors (as diagnosed according {{to the results of}} the CT-guided biopsies). EGFR mutations, specifically exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L 858 R mutations, were examined using a mutant-enriched polymerase chain reaction assay. We also examined the presence of EGFR mutations in 26 surgically resected tumor specimens and compared the results with those obtained for the corresponding wash fluid samples. ResultsThe amount of DNA obtained for the wash fluid of the CT-guided <b>biopsy</b> <b>needles</b> ranged from 35 to 2360 ng. There {{were no significant differences in}} the amount of extracted DNA according to the tumor characteristics, including tumor size and the percentage of ground glass opacity. Thirty-four of the 53 lung tumor samples were histologically diagnosed as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L 858 R mutations in EGFR were detected in 4 (12 %) and 13 (38 %) of 34 NSCLC cases, respectively. No EGFR mutations were found in the non-NSCLC cases. The EGFR mutation status in the wash fluid samples was consistent with those obtained for all 26 corresponding surgical specimens. ConclusionOur results indicate that EGFR mutations can be detected using wash fluid of CT-guided <b>biopsy</b> <b>needles.</b> In this manner, the DNA genotype can be determined even in extremely small clinical specimens using highly sensitive assays...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Using large-core <b>biopsy</b> <b>needles</b> in CT-guided {{percutaneous}} transthoracic needle biopsies (PTNB) may be advantageous {{in terms}} of larger specimens, which facilitate more extensive histopathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular examination of tumor tissue. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the success rate and safety in CT-guided PTNB using 10 G large-core <b>biopsy</b> <b>needles.</b> Methods and Materials 35 patients with intrathoracic lesions suspected of malignancy underwent CT-guided PTNB using dedicated large-core <b>biopsy</b> <b>needles</b> (10 G SpirotomeTM, Medinvents, Hasselt, Belgium). Location, tumor size, number of pleural passes, number of biopsies, histologic result, and complications (pneumothorax, bleeding) were recorded. Results Lesion location varied from pleural to hilar lo-cation. Mean tumor size was 3. 5 cm (range 0. 7 – 9. 2 cm). Only one pleural passage was necessary in all patients. Mean distance from the pleura to the lesion was 2. 6 cm (max 9. 2 cm). Large-core biopsy (10 G) was successful in 88. 6 %. Pneumothorax was found in 40 %. Minor intra-parenchymal bleeding was present in 14 patients. No major complications were recorded. Conclusion Large-core biopsy with 10 G did not show higher complication rates compared to literature. It is technically feasible and safe.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports on}} an {{ultrasonic}} bone <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle,</b> particularly focusing on design guidelines applicable for any slender tuned ultrasonic device component. Ultrasonic surgical devices are routinely used {{to cut a}} range of biological tissues, such as bone. However the realisation of an ultrasonic bone <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle</b> is particularly challenging. This {{is due to the}} requirement to generate sufficient vibrational amplitude capable of penetrating mineralised tissue, while avoiding flexural vibrational responses, which are known to reduce the performance and reliability of slender ultrasonic devices. This investigation uses finite element analysis (FEA) to predict the vibrational behaviour of a resonant needle which has dimensions that match closely to an 8 Gx 4 inch bone marrow <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle.</b> Features of the needle, including changes in material and repeated changes in diameter, have been included and systematically altered to demonstrate that the location of and geometry of these features can significantly affect the resonant frequency of bending and torsional modes of vibration while having a limited effect on the frequency and shape of the tuned longitudinal mode. Experimental modal analysis was used to identify the modal parameters of the selected needle design, validating the FEA model predictions of the longitudinal mode and the close flexural modes. This verifies that modal coupling can be avoided by judicious small geometry modifications. Finally, the tuned needle assembly was driven under typical operational excitation conditions to demonstrate that an ultrasonic <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle</b> can be designed to operate in a purely longitudinal motion...|$|R

The system is designed to insert and steer the needle under Computed Tomography (CT) guidance.

40|$|A {{clinical}} need {{is evident}} in neurosurgery to facilitate portable, real-time image guidance of interventional tools such as <b>biopsy</b> <b>needles.</b> This work presents imaging studies with microultrasound transducers incorporated into neurosurgical <b>biopsy</b> <b>needles.</b> Two design orientations are shown with the intention to provide both a forward and side field of view to a neurosurgeon. To examine the performance of these needle devices, preliminary B-scans were obtained of resected lamb brain with an embedded target whereby the forward facing and side facing needles were mechanically scanned linearly and radially respectively. The results presented images indicating the feasibility of the transducers to identify a target within brain tissue. To further investigate the transducers potential application as a viable neurosurgical tool, real-time M-mode images were generated within ex vivo porcine brain tissue with an embedded target. Assessing the M-mode images produced by the forward and side facing transducers, the devices are seen to {{have the potential to}} offer simple but effective guidance for navigating and positioning the needle within brain tissue close to a target such as a cancerous lesion or in the ventricles...|$|E

40|$|ROI-RK {{method is}} a <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle</b> {{localization}} and tracking method.

In this paper, to adapt the ROI-RK method in real 3 D US volumes, a line-filter enhancement calculation only in the ROI is added to increase the contrast between the needle and background tissue, decreasing the phenomenon of expansion of the <b>biopsy</b> <b>needle</b> due to reverberation of ultrasound in the needle. To make the ROI-RK method more stable, a self-correction system is also implemented. Real data have been acquired on an ex vivo heart of lamb.
