40|$|The phenomenal {{success of}} <b>big</b> <b>technology</b> <b>companies</b> founded {{with a strong}} {{emphasis}} on data, has epitomized the rise of the new "digital economy. " Large traditional organizations, that were not long ago "on top of the world" are now at a crossroads. Their business models seem threatened by newcomers as they face pressure to "transform" and "modernize. " Publicity has reinforced the perception that data can now be exploited and turned into a source of competitive advantage. In this context, data analytics presumably offers a vehicle to hasten this transformation. Who are the individuals leading these transformation efforts? Where do they come from? What are their challenges and perspectives? This thesis attempted to answer these questions and by doing so, uncover the "faces behind the leadership titles. " Interviews of 33 individuals leading data analytics in large traditional organizations and under different capacities, (i. e., at the C-Suite, at the senior leadership level and in middle management) had a few elements in common: They articulated the difficulty of change, and the significant challenges in balancing strategic design with political savviness and cultural awareness. At their core, these are true leadership stories. Change management processes and the "Three Perspectives on Organizations" framework offer mechanisms to better understand the root causes for inhibitors of transformation and provide a path to guide data analytics initiatives. Whether data analytics proves to be a "passing fad" or not, by now, it has served as a catalyst for large traditional organizations to embark on transformation initiatives and reexamine ways to remain relevant. Leadership stories will most certainly abound as these organizations attempt to find ways to survive and prosper in what is now the "digital age. "by Javier Mauricio Canon Moreno. Thesis: M. B.

However at the tactical, or critical, supply chain factor level, the analysis suggests that the high <b>technology</b> <b>companies</b> do have {{a different approach to}} supply chain management.

30|$|Among {{the factors}} {{mentioned}} above, {{intellectual property rights}} may be a real hamper for intersectoral mobility. In technologically developed Western countries, the problem of intellectual property initially was coming up primarily when a researcher left one private <b>technology</b> <b>company</b> {{and went to a}} competing private <b>technology</b> <b>company,</b> or when a researcher in a private <b>technology</b> <b>company</b> left and started his own <b>technology</b> <b>company.</b> Often companies required new employees to sign nondisclosure agreements but enforcing was difficult. Since the 1980 s, the problem has become even more complicated - for example, in USA after the Bayh-Dole act permitted universities to transfer rights to industry. Potentially, mobility from universities can cause lawsuits. One of the consequences of these developments is large legal staffs in universities.|$|R

40|$|Why is London a less {{successful}} entrepreneurial eco-system than the San Francisco Bay Area and arguably Boston? This question {{is discussed in}} the context of access to funding and, more specifically {{the quality and quantity of}} talent pools. This thesis then focuses on the role of the Product manager as a key source of talent in the growth of technology firms, it attempts to understand if the Bay Area/Silicon Valley innovation eco-system has an advantage because it tends to train and retain high quality PMs as it contains either the headquarters of the largest <b>technology</b> <b>companies</b> or the offices where key products are built. It found that the Bay Area contains significantly more PMs who have worked for the <b>biggest,</b> most iconic <b>technology</b> <b>companies</b> and that alumni of these firms constitute a much larger population relative to the number of PMs in firms of 500 people or less in the Bay Area than in London or Boston. The Bay Area also has significantly more Product Directors currently working for the most iconic <b>technology</b> <b>companies.</b> In branch offices there seems to be a perception (amongst junior staff) that PMs gain better experience/or career progression than their peers when based in the Bay Area, but this is disputed by more senior people (as long as the branch office has a certain scale). It is possible that informal advantages accrue to those working in large Bay Area hubs and/or that the most career focused product managers self-select by going to the Bay Area. To gather more quantitative data on this question, an exercise was undertaken to understand if there was a difference in the proportion of big tech product manager alumni founding startups between the three locations, and whether this was correlated with the success of startup fundraising and therefore the innovation eco-system. In the companies sampled, those based in the Bay Area had more than double the proportion of these alumni co-founders than London or Boston, but no substantive evidence was found that this gave the companies an advantage in terms of the amount of follow-on funding raised, but it did point to the possibility that these companies are more successful at raising any funding post Series A. However, more research is needed as due to the quality of data available, effective sample sizes were very small. by Richard Andrew Michael Wieder. Thesis: S.

40|$|Process {{development}} projects should {{meet with the}} customer expectations {{in order to be}} considered as an asset for <b>technology</b> <b>companies</b> and be turned this asset into sellable services. Customers are looking for affordable, but technologically superior process development services to be delivered in shorter lead time from <b>technology</b> <b>companies.</b> However, it is not an easy task to integrate all these features to the {{development projects}} when the tremendous effort, resources and capabilities required behind the project. Therefore, <b>technology</b> <b>companies</b> should assess their business environment, resources and capabilities they have, seek their incompetence and make decisions according to their incompetence to acquire resources, skills or capabilities internally or externally from their business environment to be able to execute such quality projects. This thesis aims to address the execution and delivery of successful process development services through strengthening the networking around <b>technology</b> <b>companies</b> in consideration of their business environment, resources and capabilities. The success behind process development services in this thesis refers to worth buying services which meet the customer expectations. In the literature review, process development projects and the work required behind are introduced with industrial reasons why production companies might need these projects. Thereafter, process development services as being an asset are addressed in terms of business environment, essential resources and key capabilities, and possible decisions to be able to execute projects and deliver the related services to the production companies. Finally, the value-adding activities to enhance the services regarding quality, time and cost saving aspects are discussed. In the own contribution, the thesis studies the networking potential of <b>technology</b> <b>companies</b> in order to achieve successful process development services. More than 150 process developers consisting of <b>technology</b> <b>companies</b> and service developers available in the Western Europe and Canada & USA are investigated to determine the business environment of a <b>technology</b> <b>company.</b> Two different studies are conducted to assess the service capabilities of <b>technology</b> <b>companies</b> and service developers, which are Competitor Analysis of <b>Technology</b> <b>Companies</b> and Service Availability Assessment of Service Providers.
