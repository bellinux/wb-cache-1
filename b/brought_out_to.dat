The episode, with police cars racing down Tennessee and Nevada Streets, featured a number of Ford Island homes and some residents appeared as extras. That year, Peter Berg featured the USS Missouri in the film Battleship. The ship, which was towed off Ford Island for maintenance, was <b>brought</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea between completion of the maintenance and its return to the dock for filming. Michael Carr, president of the Battleship Missouri Memorial, hoped that the film would spike {{the number of visitors}} to the Ford Island museum.|$|E

5|$|Some time later, the Eds {{wake up in}} {{a trailer}} home, where three girls are staring down at them. The boys have already been changed out of their dirty clothes and put into clean robes, which the girls inform them each belong {{to one of their}} three {{respective}} dads. Explaining that they are new to the area, the girls introduce themselves as Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr) and May Kanker (Erin Fitzgerald). The Eds begin to offer their own introductions, but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys' names. As the Kankers head into the kitchen to prepare food for the Eds, Double D anxiously proposes that the three of them leave. However, Eddy stops him, insisting that they stay at least for the free food. Looking around, the boys notice drawings of themselves, each paired with one the Kankers: Ed with May, Double D with Marie, and Eddy with Lee. Although left unsettled by this discovery, they eagerly accept the food that is <b>brought</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> them and begin to relax, as the Kankers slip a movie into the VCR and go upstairs to freshen up.|$|E

25|$|The {{procession}} of Holy Wednesday and Good Friday features close to forty pasos de misterios or carrozas and draws a huge crowd as spectators and participants as heirlooms images and newly commissioned ones are brought out. What sets it {{apart from other}} Semana Santa processions in the province {{is not so much}} the number of carrozas, but the solemnity and decorum on how it is done. The Hermandad de la Sagrada Pasion is the first in the province to have initiated the narration of the passion in dramatized form as the pasos are <b>brought</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the streets. This is a rite that was eventually copied by the rest of the towns in Bulacan.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} {{contestant}} has either answered all five questions or {{run out of}} time, the host reveals {{how many people in}} the survey matched each of his/her answers. The board is then cleared except for the total score, and the second contestant is then <b>brought</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> answer the same five questions. The same rules are followed, but the time limit is extended by five seconds (originally 20, then extended to 25); in addition, if the second contestant duplicates an answer given by the first, a buzzer sounds and he/she must give another answer. If the two contestants reach a combined total of 200 points or more, the family wins the bonus. If not, they are given $5 per point scored as a consolation prize.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1893 Hattie Hansen was <b>brought</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> {{the sound}} through the Duwamish River, which {{at that time}} {{connected}} to Lake Washington. Her new owners, the Hansen family, {{put her on the}} route from Seattle to Dogfish Bay, (or Liberty Bay as local residents prefer.) Capt. J.J. Hansen served as her master. In 1898 she was switched over to the Hood Canal mail route for a time, later returning to the Seattle - Poulsbo route, where she stayed until 1902. Her last master on the Poulsbo run was Capt. Alf Hostmark (1875–1953). J.F. Curtis and Sons bought Hattie Hansen in 1903 and put her on the Everett - Coupeville route, under Capt. A.H. Curtis, where she ran until the ferry Whidby was placed on the route, and she was sold to a Canadian firm.|$|E

25|$|With either two {{or three}} overs {{remaining}} on day five (depending on how fast the overs were bowled) the game looked certain for a draw (as India still had three wickets in hand and were 122 runs behind). But Clarke, in just his second over, took two wickets in consecutive balls {{to be on a}} hat-trick. The first ball of his second over reared after drawing a puff of dust, caught the shoulder of Harbhajan's bat and flew to Hussey at slip, and R. P. Singh padded up to his first ball and was adjudged lbw. There was an extensive delay as the last batsman Sharma took to the field with two right-handed gloves and had to wait for the correct glove to be <b>brought</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> him. This led to suspicion that the Sharma's actions were not accidental but a time-wasting ploy. Clarke took the final wicket, Sharma, in the same over, giving Australia victory. Kumble finished the day unbeaten on 45.|$|E
25|$|One of {{controversial}} they had was in 2006 {{when the team}} toured England for four match Test series. England led the series 2-0 after three matches before coming in the final match. In that match, however, they were bowled out for 173 and Pakistan scored 504. In second innings after the dismissal of Alastair Cook for 83 off the bowling of Umar Gul, with a delivery of reverse swing, resulted in umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove calling a halt to play so a set of used balls could be <b>brought</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the middle.

500|$|Valhalla is {{mentioned}} in euhemerized form {{and as an}} element of remaining Norse pagan belief in Heimskringla. In chapter 8 of Ynglinga saga, the [...] "historical" [...] Odin is described as ordaining burial laws over his country. These laws include that all the dead are to be burned on a pyre on a burial mound with their possessions, and their ashes are to be <b>brought</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea or buried in the earth. The dead would then arrive in Valhalla with everything that one had on their pyre, and whatever one had hidden in the ground. Valhalla is additionally referenced in the phrase [...] "visiting Odin" [...] in a work by the 10th century skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir describing that, upon his death, King Vanlandi went to Valhalla.|$|E
500|$|The protests {{have drawn}} {{criticism}} from some {{observers of the}} Sri Lankan Civil War. In an opinion piece titled [...] "Misguided Tamil protesters" [...] published by the National Post, Martin Collacott, a former High Commissioner of Canada to Sri Lanka, questioned {{the objectives of the}} protesters. In the editorial, he insisted that if the primary concern of the protesters was the safety of Tamil civilians, they would have asked the LTTE to free those trapped in the war zone instead of using them as human shields. However, by asking for a ceasefire, he said, the protesters want to [...] "bring about a situation that would allow the Tigers to preserve their fighting capability and prolong the insurgency." [...] The article goes on to question why children who were born in Canada to native Sri Lankan parents were <b>brought</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> protests among others who were waving the flag of an organisation Canada has labelled a terrorist organization.|$|E

Forbes {{described it as}} [...] "an exquisite birthday present". Many of Crawford's associates worried about him, aware that he lived alone at his cottage in Nursling—with only the company of his elderly housekeeper and cats—and that he lacked either a car or telephone. It was there that he died in his sleep {{on the night of}} 28–29 November 1957. He had arranged for some of his letters and books to be destroyed, while others were to be sent to the Bodleian Library, with the proviso that some of them would not be opened until the year 2000. His body was buried in the church graveyard at Nursling. In accordance with his instructions, the title [...] "Editor of Antiquity" [...] was inscribed on his gravestone, reflecting his desire to be remembered primarily as an archaeologist. On Crawford's death, the editorship of Antiquity was taken on by Daniel.|$|E
