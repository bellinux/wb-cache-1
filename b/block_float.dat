40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{describes}} {{a new technique}} for designing FFTs for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) transmitters and receivers. Using the new technique, signals within the FFT structure are scaled {{so that there is}} an optimum trade-off between saturation and rounding. Conventional FFT designs avoid saturation, either by using fixed scaling factors which ensure that signal levels are always below the saturation level or by using <b>block</b> <b>floating</b> point. For fixed-point arithmetic of a given precision, the new technique results in better signal to noise ratio (SNR). The SNR improvement increases with the size of the FFT. The implementation complexity is significantly less than that of <b>block</b> <b>floating</b> point and equal, or slightly greater than that of conventional fixed scaling, depending on the radix of the FFT. Matlab simulation results are presented which compare the performance of the new technique with conventional designs for a range of FFT sizes. An FFT using the new design has been implemented and tested using the Analog Devices ADSP-BF 533 Processor demonstrating the performance of the new technique in a realtime environment. I...|$|R
50|$|A <b>floating</b> <b>block</b> {{in writing}} and {{publishing}} is any graphic, text, table, or other representation that is unaligned from the main flow of text. Use of <b>floating</b> <b>blocks</b> to present pictures and tables is a typical feature of academic writing and technical writing, including scientific articles and books. <b>Floating</b> <b>blocks</b> are normally labeled with a caption or title that describes its contents and a number {{that is used to}} refer to the figure from the main text. A common system divides <b>floating</b> <b>block</b> into two separately numbered series, labeled figure (for pictures, diagrams, plots, etc.) and table.

50|$|<b>Block</b> <b>Floating</b> Point (BFP) {{algorithms}} are {{a kind of}} algorithm used {{to emulate}} floating point while using a fixed point processor. The algorithm will assign an entire block of data an exponent, rather than single units themselves being assigned an exponent, thus making them a block, rather than a simple <b>floating</b> point. <b>Block</b> floating-point algorithm operations are done through a block using a common exponent, and can be advantageous to limit the space use in the hardware to perform the same functions as floating-point algorithms.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Recently, a block based {{adaptive}} decision feedback equalizer (ADFE) {{is presented}} which first uses an iterative scheme {{to evaluate a}} block of unknown decisions. FFT based block processing is then used on the received input block and the decision block {{to carry out the}} block ADFE operation. A direct floating point (FP) based realization of this scheme, however, pushes up the cost and complexity of processing hugely, as each FP operation involves several additional steps not present in its fixed point (FxP) counterpart. To overcome this problem, a <b>block</b> <b>floating</b> point (BFP) based treatment is presented in this paper for realization of the block ADFE. The proposed scheme, while maintaining FP like high dynamic range, deploys mostly FxP operations and thus reduces the processing cost and complexity substantially. I...|$|R

Whenever two or more lines are cleared simultaneously, the player's side of the pile moves down, [...] "pushing" [...] the opponent's side upwards (The player's side is seen on the top screen, while the bottom screen shows the opponent's side upside-down, since the bottoms of both players' piles push against each other). The goal is to push the pile down so it overlaps the opponent's danger line. Push mode features a Donkey Kong backdrop.|$|R

30|$|An {{efficient}} {{scheme is}} presented for implementing the sign LMS algorithm in <b>block</b> <b>floating</b> point format, which permits {{processing of data}} over a wide dynamic range at a processor complexity and cost as low {{as that of a}} fixed point processor. The proposed scheme adopts appropriate formats for representing the filter coefficients and the data. It also employs a scaled representation for the step-size that has a time-varying mantissa and also a time-varying exponent. Using these and an upper bound on the step-size mantissa, update relations for the filter weight mantissas and exponent are developed, taking care so that neither overflow occurs, nor are quantities which are already very small multiplied directly. Separate update relations are also worked out for the step size mantissa. The proposed scheme employs mostly fixed-point-based operations, and thus achieves considerable speedup over its floating-point-based counterpart.|$|R
50|$|The game is {{basically}} a Breakout clone: the player controls a paddle {{at the bottom and}} deflects a single ball, hitting different colored blocks {{on the top of the}} screen without having the ball fall below the screen. Clearing all the blocks results in completing the level and going to the next. There are 50 levels to complete. Similarly as Arkanoid and MegaBall, there is an inclusion of power-ups other than extra balls. Various power-ups appear when hitting random <b>blocks,</b> <b>floating</b> downwards towards the bottom and can be picked up by touching it with the paddle. If only a single block remains on a level and it continues to be untouched by the bouncing ball for a minute or so, an electricity sound begins to build and eventually the block is blasted away by a lightning.|$|R

As CNN is attributed to the strong endurance to computation errors, employing <b>block</b> <b>floating</b> point (BFP) arithmetics in CNN accelerators could save the hardware cost and data traffics efficiently, while maintaining the classification accuracy. In this paper, we verify the effects of word width definitions in BFP to the CNN performance without retraining. Several typical CNN models, including VGG 16, ResNet- 18, ResNet- 50 and GoogLeNet, were tested in this paper. Experiments revealed that 8 -bit mantissa, including sign bit, in BFP representation merely induced less than 0. 3 % accuracy loss. In addition, we investigate the computational errors in theory and develop the noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) upper bound, which provides the promising guidance for BFP based CNN engine design.

Proposed algorithm along with its generalization to normalization of complex vectors, re-sults in significant reduction in precision requirements on FFT and IFFT as well. It is related to <b>block</b> <b>floating</b> point representation of numbers but overhead due to exponents have been avoided.

One touch from the sharp-edged blocks would have ripped open the side of the bark canoe like a knife, and in the icy cold water, encumbered by floating fragments of ice, even the best swimmer could not have gained the solid ice. The peril was great, and it needed all the strength and activity of the white men and the skill of the paddlers to avoid the danger which momentarily threatened them. So quickly did the <b>blocks</b> <b>float</b> down upon them that Pearson thought it might be impossible to avoid them all.
