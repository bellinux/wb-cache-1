40|$|Retrieval by {{different}} mesh-sized plankton nets is compared, using the abundance and distribution patterns of cyclopoid copepods {{of the genus}} Oithona W. Baird, 1843 as a case study. Mesozooplankton was sampled during spring, summer, and autumn of 2000 - 2002 in the South China Sea. Plankton samples were collected by surface tows (5 - 0 m) and by oblique tows in three different depth layers (0 - 50 m, 0 - 100 m, and 0 - 150 m), with Norpac zooplankton nets of 333 and 100 mu m mesh size. The oithonid density and diversity in the plankton samples collected through a 100 mu m mesh was about one order of magnitude higher than those collected through a 333 mu m mesh. The mean occurrence frequency of Oithona spp. in the plankton samples collected through a 100 mu m <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> was > 85 % and > 60 % through a 333 mu m <b>mesh</b> <b>net,</b> with a mean total density of 45. 86 +/- 206. 97 m(- 3) for the 100 mu m <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> compared to 2. 28 +/- 21. 94 m(- 3) for the 333 mu m <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> [which indicates the enormous patchiness in occurrence of these copepods]. The density of smaller mesozooplankton, as evidenced by Oithona spp., has thus been underestimated by previous researchers using larger <b>meshed</b> <b>nets.</b> Samples collected through a 100 mu m <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> demonstrated the numerical importance of the genus Oithona and its distinct seasonal and interannual patterns of abundance and distribution in the South China Sea...|$|R

25|$|Behavioral {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} that sharks can take visual cues in order to discriminate between different objects. The bull shark is able to discriminate between colors of <b>mesh</b> <b>netting</b> that is present underwater. It was found that bull sharks tended to avoid <b>mesh</b> <b>netting</b> of bright colors rather than colors that blended in with the water. Bright yellow <b>mesh</b> <b>netting</b> {{was found to be}} easily avoided when it was placed {{in the path of the}} bull shark. This was found to be the reason that sharks are attracted to bright yellow survival gear rather than ones that were painted black. This is very important because it gives an insight into how bull sharks are able to pick up certain visual keys underwater that might give them an advantage when seeking out certain prey.|$|R

40|$|Hammerhead sharks have {{experienced}} a drastic global reduction in abundance, yet limited data exist on their general biology and population structure. We use generalised linear models (GLMs) to analyse historical <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> and drumline catches (1996 - 2006) of Sphyrna lewini from the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP), which covers 10 locations on the north-east coast of Australia. Results show a significant decline in S. lewini female total length over the study period and {{a significant increase in}} annual CPUE on the Gold Coast. Sexual segregation was found in Cairns, where S. lewini males were most abundant. A positive linear relationship was found between maternal total length and litter size. Birth-size embryos were found in most months. However, normal birth size (0. 50 m) embryos were found in pregnant females most often during spring and summer. <b>Mesh</b> <b>nets</b> were more selective for smaller S. lewini than drumlines. It is recognised that species selectivity of other, more potentially dangerous shark species varies between gear types, but replacement of <b>mesh</b> <b>nets</b> with drumlines would reduce the catch of smaller individuals of S. lewini and assist in their conservation.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{temporal and}} spatial abundance patterns of echinoderm larvae in La Parguera, Puerto Rico. For the temporal study, larvae were sampled {{by a series of}} monthly tows taken with a 64 μm <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> between the new and full moon from April 2005 to July 2006, September 2006 and August 2007. In order to measure spatial variation of echinoderm larval bundances, oblique tows were taken with 64 and 202 μm <b>mesh</b> <b>nets</b> at seven different sites within the shelf, at the shelf-edge, and at a nearby oceanic stations during August 2007. Overall, Echinoidea (sea urchin) exhibited the highest abundance with a total of 11 921 larvae, representing 52. 5 % of the total collection. Ophiuroidea (brittle star) ranked second in abundance with 45. 6 % of the total larvae. Holothuroidea (sea cucumber) and Asteroidea larvae (sea star) accounted for less than 2 % of the total echinoderm larval collection. Early larval stages (2 - 8 day old) of Diadema antillarum represented 20 % of the total Echinoidea larvae. There was no marked seasonal trend of echinoderm larval abundance; Echinoidea and Ophiuroidea larvae were present in all monthly samples indicating that reproduction occurs year-round. Peak abundances of later-stage Echinoidea larvae were observed during January, July and October and of later-stage Ophiuroidea larvae during June, August and October. The observed peaks of later-stage larval abundances may be indicative of higher recruitment activity during these months. There was a significant difference of echinoderm larval abundance between spatial stations, with higher abundances collected at the shelf-edge. Later-stage (~ 24 day old) D. antillarum larvae were mostly collected at shelf-edge and oceanic locations. In addition, the 64 mm <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> was more efficient for collection of echinoderm larvae than the 202 mm <b>mesh</b> <b>net.</b> Rev. Biol. Trop. 58 (Suppl. 3) : 81 - 88.

40|$|In the {{following}} thesis a procedure is developed {{to determine the}} engineering performance of an inshore trawling system from {{an analysis of the}} forces acting on the towing warps and bridle system. Equilibrium force balance equations are derived for each warp and solved using a fourth-order Runge kutta numerical analysis method. The procedure is then applied to an inshore trawl and the results are used in the comparison of vessel power and gear drag. [...] In addition towing tank drag measurements were made on small polyethylene nets. The effect of the development of turbulent flow around the net on the drag of the net is investigated. Empirical drag coefficients are also derived for polyethylene netting from these measurements. The coefficients are then used in empirical trawl net drag calculations using methods developed by Dickson, Kowalski and Fridman. In addition the relationship between the orientation of a mesh and the drag of the net is investigated. It is shown how mesh orientation can explain the reduced drag of a square <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> as compared to a diamond <b>mesh</b> <b>net...</b>|$|R
