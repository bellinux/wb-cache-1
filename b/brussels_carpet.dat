2500|$|<b>Brussels</b> <b>carpet</b> have {{a smooth}} {{slightly}} ribbed surface and their patterning is well defined, a characteristic {{feature of the}} carpet. Closeness of pile rather than height contributes to their neat appearance and hard wearing properties, although they do not simulate the luxury of cut-pile carpets. Brussels Wilton Carpets were initially produced on 27inch(3/4) [...] looms and were sewn together by hand. The looms could incorporate up to 5 frames all with different colours thus enabling figured or pattern carpets to be manufactured. With judicial [...] and very skilful planting of colours in the frames the number of colours could [...] be increased to about twenty thus enabling very complex designs to be produced. Due to the additional costs in labour these carpets were normally only produced for the bespoke market.|$|E

60|$|Well, it was {{a joyous}} and bustling day when, after one of those {{domestic}} whirlwinds which the women are fond of denominating house-cleaning, the new <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpet</b> was at length brought in and nailed down, and its beauty praised from mouth to mouth.

60|$|Japan {{is a great}} people. Her masons {{play with}} stone, her {{carpenters}} with wood, her smiths with iron, and her artists with life, death, and all the eye can take in. Mercifully she has been denied the last touch of firmness in her character which would enable her {{to play with the}} whole round world.

50|$|Up {{until the}} Victorian era {{it was a}} hamlet a {{kilometre}} downstream of Crayford where no more than sixteen homes were clustered. A calico-printing works drew water power from the culverted River Wansunt in early Victorian times, being later adapted for the manufacture of rubber goods, then felt and finally <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpets.</b> This carpet mill was demolished by 1890 and Barnes Cray House, the next largest building, was cleared by 1933, ending its days as a nursing home.|$|R
5000|$|On September 9, 1880, the richly {{appointed}} Grand Hotel was opened, {{adorned with}} fine oil paintings, thick <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpets,</b> toilet stands, elegant chandeliers, silk-covered furniture, walnut furniture, and a kitchen with {{hot and cold}} running water. At {{the height of the}} silver mining boom, when the population was about 10,000, the city was host to Kelly's Wine House, featuring 26 varieties of wine imported from Europe, a beer imported from Colorado named [...] "Coors", cigars, a bowling alley, and many other amenities common to large cities.|$|R
25|$|The {{town was}} less than a year old and its {{population}} had exploded from about 100 residents in March 1879 when it consisted mostly of wooden shacks and tents. By the fall of 1879 more than a thousand hardy miners and merchants lived in a canvas and matchstick camp built on top of the richest silver strike in the United States.

60|$|She watched them, dry-eyed, as {{they carried}} it away. It {{seemed like a}} coffin. Only Mammy Easter guessed at the pain in Virginia's breast, and that was {{because there was a}} pain in her own. They took the {{rosewood}} what-not, but Virginia snatched the songs before the men could touch them, and held them in her arms. They seized the mahogany velvet-bottomed chairs, her uncle's wedding present to her mother; and, last of all, they ruthlessly tore up the <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpet,</b> beginning near the spot where Clarence had spilled ice-cream at one of her children's parties.|$|E
60|$|Alas! she had {{fastened}} on {{a flaw in}} my education. This was {{a problem}} absolutely new to me. I thought of my father, of Mr Waggett, Dr Grose, Dr Phelps, the old farmer in the railway train, of Sir Walter Pollacke, my bishop, Heathcliff, Mr Bowater, Mr Clodd, even Henry--or rather all these male phantoms went whisking {{across the back of}} my mind, calling up every other two-legged creature of the same gender within sight or hearing. Meanwhile, Mrs Bowater stood like Patience on her <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpet,</b> or rather like Thomas de Torquemada, watching these intellectual contortions.|$|E
60|$|The drawing-room at the Hotel de la Fleur {{was a small}} room, with {{a cottage}} piano, and a suite of {{mahogany}} furniture, covered in stamped velvet, neatly arranged around the walls. On round tables were photograph albums, and on the walls enlarged photographs of Tiare and her first husband, Captain Johnson. Still, though Tiare was old and fat, on occasion we rolled back the <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpet,</b> brought in the maids {{and one or two}} friends of Tiare's, and danced, though now to the wheezy music of a gramaphone. On the verandah the air was scented with the heavy perfume of the tiare, and overhead the Southern Cross shone in a cloudless sky.|$|E
500|$|Another {{factor in}} the decline was the change in Dawson City, which had {{developed}} throughout 1898, metamorphosing from a ramshackle, if wealthy, boom town into a more sedate, conservative municipality. Modern luxuries were introduced, including the [...] "zinc bath tubs and pianos, billiard tables, <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpets</b> in the hotel dining rooms, menus printed in French and invitational balls" [...] noted by historian Kathryn Winslow. The visiting Senator Jerry Lynch likened the newly paved streets with their smartly dressed inhabitants to the Strand in London. It was no longer as attractive a location for many prospectors, used to a wilder way of living. Even the formerly lawless town of Skagway had become a stable and respectable community by 1899.|$|R
5000|$|The carpet bag {{was invented}} {{as a type}} of baggage light enough for a {{passenger}} to carry, like a duffel bag, as opposed to a wooden or metal trunk, which required the assistance of porters. It was a good traveling companion: in 1886, the Scientific American described it as old-fashioned and reliable: the carpet bag [...] "is still unsurpassed by any, where rough wear is the principal thing to be studied. Such a bag, if constructed of good <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpeting</b> and unquestionable workmanship, will last a lifetime, provided always that a substantial frame is used." [...] Its use implied self-sufficiency: in Jules Verne's 1873 novel Around the World in Eighty Days, Phileas Fogg and Passepartout bring only a carpet bag as luggage, which holds a few items of clothing {{and a great deal of}} cash.|$|R
5000|$|The station {{initially}} {{had just}} one platform on the landward side with a loop line closer to the sea, but a second platform was added to serve the loop line on 1 May 1858. The original wooden station and train shed was burnt down on 14 August 1873. [...] The South Devon Railway built a new station with the platforms connected by an iron bridge, roofed with glass. The principal buildings were constructed adjoining Station Road, and the booking office was fitted with pitch pine cornice and fittings. Star gas pendent lights were installed, and a lift for taking up luggage to the platform levels. The first-class waiting rooms were furnished with <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpets</b> and polished oak furniture. The contractor was Blatchford and Son of Tavistock and the cost was £4,000 (...) [...] The new station was re-opened on 12 April 1875 ...|$|R
60|$|If Mrs. Gaylord had dimly {{imagined}} {{that she should}} see something more of him, having him so near at hand, she really saw less: there was no weather, by day or night, in which he could not go to his office, now. He went no more than his wife into the village society; {{she might have been}} glad now and then of a little glimpse of the world, but she never said so, and her social life had ceased, like her religious life. Their house was richly furnished according to the local taste of the time; the parlor had a <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpet,</b> and heavy chairs of mahogany and hair-cloth; Marcia had a piano there, and since she had come home from school they had made company, as Mrs. Gaylord called it, two or three times for her; but they had held aloof from the festivity, the Squire in his office, and Mrs. Gaylord in the family room where they now sat in unwonted companionship.|$|E
60|$|Because of {{his many}} wants there is but one hotel for the Englishman in Osaka, and they call it Juter's. Here the views of two civilisations collide {{and the result is}} awful. The {{building}} is altogether Japanese; wood and tile and sliding screen from top to bottom; but the fitments are mixed. My room, for instance, held a tokonoma, made of the polished black stem of a palm and delicate woodwork, framing a scroll picture representing storks. But on the floor over the white mats lay a <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpet</b> that made the indignant toes tingle. From the back verandah one overhung the river which ran straight as an arrow between two lines of houses. They have cabinet-makers in Japan to fit the rivers to the towns. From my verandah I could see three bridges--one a hideous lattice-girder arrangement--and part of a fourth. We were on an island and owned a watergate if we wanted to take a boat.|$|E
6000|$|Although {{the palace}} has not {{attained}} anything like its full growth, yet what exists is quite {{big enough for}} the monarch of such a little country; and Versailles or Windsor has not apartments more nobly proportioned. The Queen resides in the Ajuda, a building of much less pretensions, of which the yellow walls and beautiful gardens are seen between Belem and the city. The Necessidades are only used for grand galas, receptions of ambassadors, and ceremonies of state. In the throne-room is a huge throne, surmounted by an enormous gilt crown, than which I {{have never seen anything}} larger in the finest pantomime at Drury Lane; but the effect of this splendid piece is lessened by a shabby old <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpet,</b> almost the only other article of furniture in the apartment, and not quite large enough to cover its spacious floor. The looms of Kidderminster have supplied the web which ornaments the [...] "Ambassadors' Waiting-Room," [...] and the ceilings are painted with huge allegories in distemper, which pretty well correspond with the other furniture. Of all the undignified objects in the world, a palace out at elbows is surely the meanest. Such places ought not to be seen in adversity,--splendour is their decency,--and when no longer able to maintain it, they should sink to the level of their means, calmly subside into manufactories, or go shabby in seclusion.|$|E
5000|$|The two-story Greek Revival {{house was}} {{designed}} by Thomas Whaley himself and construction began on May 6, 1856. Completed in 1857, {{the cost of the}} house was more than $10,000. It was made from bricks created in Whaley's brickyard on Conde Street. The house was {{the first of its kind}} in San Diego. [...] "My new house, when completed, will be the handsomest, most comfortable and convenient place in town or within 150 miles of here." [...] Thomas Whaley [...] Whaley's new house was known as the finest in Southern California. The house was furnished with mahogany and rosewood furniture, <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpets,</b> and damask drapes and was considered a mansion for its time and place. The residence became the gathering place for San Diego. Besides being the Whaley family home, it was also San Diego's first commercial theater, the county courthouse, and a general store.|$|R
5000|$|When {{he looked}} at the houses in which his {{subscribers}} lived, their drab hideousness made him sick. When he went inside and contemplated the lambrequins, the gilded cattails, the Rogers groups, the wax fruit under glass domes, the emblazoned seashells from Asbury Park, the family Bible on the marble-topped center-table, the crayon enlargements of Uncle Richard and Aunt Sue, the square pianos, the <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpets,</b> the grained woodwork—when his eyes alighted upon such things, his soul revolted, and at once his moral enthusiasm incited him to attempt a reform. The result was a long series of Ladies’ Home Journal crusades against the hideousness of the national scene [...] - [...] in domestic architecture, in house furnishing, in dress, in town buildings, in advertising. Bok flung himself headlong into his campaigns, and practically every one of them succeeded. ... If there were gratitude in the land, there would be a monument to him in every town in the Republic.

25|$|After {{the first}} World War the carpets {{started to be}} {{produced}} for the general market using popular designs and colourways but they always remained at the luxury end of the general market. The growing middle class {{of the twentieth century}} aspired to acquire a Wilton carpet for their 'best' room. Despite the impact of industrialization, the areas where <b>Brussels</b> Wilton <b>carpets</b> were produced remained centred mainly in the Midlands around the towns of Wilton and Kidderminster and in West Yorkshire where the firm of John Crossley and Sons in Halifax became synonymous with carpet manufacture. There were smaller areas of manufacture in Scotland and Durham. With the development of different manufacturing methods and looms capable of the mass production of carpets, the public began change their décor, including carpets, on a regular basis, which increased the demand for carpets. The last quarter of the 20th century saw the rapid decline of the labour-intensive <b>Brussels</b> Wilton <b>carpets.</b> Very few of the original ¾ Wilton looms still exist and the few that do are either in museums or used by small manufacturers that continue to produce bespoke (custom-made) luxury carpets for the elite and to replace carpets in historic buildings in the UK and abroad.|$|R

Because the room which they call a front parlor is made {{expressly}} so that you never shall know. They sit in a back room,--work, talk, read, perhaps. After the servant has let you in and opened a crack of the shutters, and while you sit waiting for them to change their dress and come in, you speculate as to what they may be doing. From some distant region, the laugh of a child, the song of a canary-bird reaches you, and then a door claps hastily to. Do they love plants? Do they write letters, sew, embroider, crochet? Do they ever romp and frolic? What books do they read? Do they sketch or paint? Of all these possibilities the mute and muffled room says nothing. A sofa and six chairs, two ottomans fresh from the upholsterer's, a <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpet,</b> a centre-table with four gilt Books of Beauty on it, a mantel-clock from Paris, and two bronze vases,--all those tell you only in frigid tones, 'This is the best room,'--only that, and nothing more,--and soon she trips in in her best clothes, and apologizes for keeping you waiting, asks how your mother is, and you remark that it is a pleasant day, and thus the acquaintance progresses from year to year. One hour in the back room, where the plants and canary-bird and children are, might have made you fast friends for life; but, little as it is, you care no more for them than for the gilt clock on the mantel.|$|E
60|$|I {{went down}} to the Marie Celeste that evening, and looked over my berth, which was {{extremely}} comfortable considering the small size of the vessel. Mr. Goring, whom I had seen in the morning, was to have the one next mine. Opposite was the captain's cabin and a small berth for Mr. John Harton, a gentleman who was going out {{in the interests of the}} firm. These little rooms were arranged on each side of the passage which led from the main-deck to the saloon. The latter was a comfortable room, the panelling tastefully done in oak and mahogany, with a rich <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpet</b> and luxurious settees. I was very much pleased with the accommodation, and also with Tibbs the captain, a bluff, sailor-like fellow, with a loud voice and hearty manner, who welcomed me to the ship with effusion, and insisted upon our splitting a bottle of wine in his cabin. He told me that he intended to take his wife and youngest child with him on the voyage, and that he hoped with good luck to make Lisbon in three weeks. We had a pleasant chat and parted the best of friends, he warning me to make the last of my preparations next morning, as he intended to make a start by the midday tide, having now shipped all his cargo. I went back to my hotel, where I found a letter from my wife awaiting me, and, after a refreshing night's sleep, returned to the boat in the morning. From this point I am able to quote from the journal which I kept in order to vary the monotony of the long sea-voyage. If it is somewhat bald in places I can at least rely upon its accuracy in details, as it was written conscientiously from day to day.|$|E
60|$|I {{believe that}} the masses, during the early middle age, were very well off; quite as well off as they deserved; that is, earned for themselves. They lived in a rough way, certainly: but {{roughness}} is not discomfort, where the taste has not been educated. A Red Indian sleeps as well in a wigwam as we in a spring bed; and the Irish babies thrive as well among the peat ashes as on a <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpet.</b> Man is a very well constructed being, and can live and multiply anywhere, provided he can keep warm, and get pure water and enough to eat. Indeed, our Teutonic fathers must have been comfortably off, or {{they could not have}} multiplied as they did. Even though their numbers may have been overstated, the fact is patent, that howsoever they were slaughtered down, by the Romans or by each other, they rose again as out of the soil, more numerous than ever. Again and again you read of a tribe being all but exterminated by the Romans, and in a few years find it bursting over the Pfalzgrab or the Danube, more numerous and terrible than before. Never believe that a people deprest by cold, ill-feeding, and ill-training, could have conquered Europe in the face of centuries of destructive war. Those very wars, again, may have helped in the long run the increase of population, and for a reason simple enough, though often overlooked. War throws land out of cultivation; and when peace returns, the new settlers find the land fallow, and more or less restored to its original fertility; and so begins a period of rapid and prosperous increase. In no other way can I explain the rate at which nations after the most desolating wars spring up, young and strong again, like the phoenix, from their own funeral pile. They begin afresh as the tillers of a virgin soil, fattened too often with the ashes of burnt homesteads, and the blood of the slain.|$|E
50|$|The {{fifth and}} {{youngest}} son, Francis, {{was sent to}} school at Halifax; while still a schoolboy his pocket money was made dependent on his own work. A loom was set up for him in his father's mill, on which he spent the time not spent at school. The carpet manufactory at Dean Clough was commenced by John Crossley in a small way, but it became, under the management of John Crossley, jun., Joseph Crossley, and Francis Crossley, who constituted the firm of J. Crossley & Sons, the largest concern {{of its kind in}} the world. Its buildings covered an area of 20 acre, and the firm gave employment to between five and six thousand persons. Its rapid growth was by application of steam power and machinery to the production of carpets. The Crossley firm acquired patents and then devised and patented improvements which placed them in advance of the rest of the trade. One loom, the patent of which became their property, was found capable of weaving about six times as much as could be produced by the old hand loom. Manufacturers of tapestry and <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpets</b> applied to Messrs. Crossley for licences to work their patents, and large sums accrued to them from royalties alone.|$|R
6000|$|She {{had been}} at Portland several times with her father; but he stopped at a second-class hotel where he had always [...] "put up" [...] when alone, and she was new to the vastness of hotel mirrors and chandeliers, the glossy paint, the frescoing, the fluted pillars, the {{tessellated}} marble pavements upon which she stepped {{when she left the}} <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpeting</b> of the parlors. She clung to Bartley's arm, silently praying that she might not do anything to mortify him, and admiring everything he did with all her soul. He made a halt as they entered the glittering dining-room, and stood frowning till the head-waiter ran respectfully up to them, and ushered them with sweeping bows to a table, which they had to themselves. Bartley ordered their dinner with nonchalant ease, beginning with soup and going to black coffee with dazzling intelligence. While their waiter was gone with their order, he beckoned with one finger to another, and sent him out for a paper, which he unfolded and spread on the table, taking a toothpick into his mouth, and running the sheet over with his eyes. [...] "I just want to see what's going on to-night," [...] he said, without looking at Marcia.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said I, [...] "and, what is more, the <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpets</b> of England are woven on looms {{invented by}} an American, and bought of him. Our countryman, Bigelow, went to England to study carpet-weaving in the English looms, supposing that all arts were generously {{open for the}} {{instruction}} of learners. He was denied the opportunity of studying the machinery and watching the processes by a shortsighted jealousy. He immediately sat down with a yard of carpeting, and, patiently unraveling it thread by thread, combined and calculated till he invented the machinery on which the best carpets of the Old and the New World are woven. No pains which such ingenuity and energy can render effective are spared to make our fabrics equal those of the British market, and we need only to be disabused of the old prejudice, and {{to keep up with}} the movement of our own country, and find out our own resources. The fact is, every year improves our fabrics. Our mechanics, our manufacturers, are working with an energy, a zeal, and a skill that carry things forward faster than anybody dreams of; and nobody can predicate the character of American articles in any department now by their character even five years ago." ...|$|R

Thirty-five years before, Peter Hope, then a young dandy with side whiskers close-cropped and terminating just below the ear; with wavy, brown hair, giving to his fresh-complexioned face an appearance almost girlish; in cut-away blue coat, flowered waistcoat, black silk cravat secured by two gold pins chained together, and tightly strapped grey trouserings, had, aided and abetted by a fragile little lady in crinoline and much-flounced skirt, and bodice somewhat low, with corkscrew curls each movement of her head set ringing, planned and furnished it {{in accordance with the}} sober canons then in vogue, spending thereupon more than they should, as is to be expected from the young to whom the future promises all things.

Only by the help of the round island underneath the massive Empire table, by excursions into untrodden corners, could Peter recollect the rainbow floor his feet had pressed when he was twenty-one. The noble bookcase, surmounted by Minerva's bust. Really it was too expensive. But the nodding curls had been so obstinate. Peter's silly books and papers must be put away in order; the curls did not intend to permit any excuse for untidiness. So, too, the handsome, brass-bound desk; it must be worthy of the beautiful thoughts Peter would pen upon it. The great sideboard, supported by two such angry-looking mahogany lions; it must be strong to support the weight of silver clever Peter would one day purchase to place upon it.

The names 2 ̆ 2 coach lace 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 livery lace 2 ̆ 2 were used consistently throughout its manufacture. The robust looped wool pile created by a supplementary warp, was a variation of velvet similar to <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpeting</b> and makes this trim easily identifiable. This paper examines the manufacturing of American coach lace from the mid- 18 th century until its demise in the 19302 ̆ 7 s. Coach lace is a textile little recognized today.

50|$|Ireland was succeeded at the Golden Cross by Robert Ellis and then, in the 1840s, by the {{brothers}} James and William Creech. In 1849, James Creech got into financial difficulties and, after borrowing money against {{the contents of}} the pub, all the property’s goods were seized and sold by the Sheriff of Sussex to pay Creech's creditors. Thanks to the subsequent debt collector's record, we have {{a detailed description of the}} inn's interior and furnishings in 1849. The 20-room inn offered drink, food, lodgings and recreations to gentlemen of comfortable means. On the top floor were four bedrooms, furnished with Japanned (black lacquered) and mahogany bedsteads, dressing tables, wash stands and chests of drawers; white dimity, leather-covered armchairs; and Kidderminster or <b>Brussels</b> <b>carpets.</b> On the second floor were three slightly bigger rooms, with four-poster beds. On the first floor were four comfortable sitting rooms, with open fires, velvet-covered oak chairs and mahogany tables. The third sitting room had a piano in a mahogany case. The first floor also had a ballroom (where the current theatre is). Its fittings included a mahogany board for the game of Racehorse Balls and 20 brown ware spittoons. The ground floor featured the bar, plus a parlour (with 20 iron spittoons) and a coffee room, with a writing desk. The bar featured an 18 x 3 ft counter and a spirit fountain with eight brass taps. The kitchen was well equipped, with numerous pans, fish steamers and a five-foot kitchen range.|$|R
