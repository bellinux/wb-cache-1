5000|$|A {{classical}} rotating {{air surveillance}} radar system detects target echoes against a <b>background</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise.</b> It reports these detections (known as [...] "plots") in polar coordinates representing {{the range and}} bearing of the target. In addition, noise in the radar receiver will occasionally exceed the detection threshold of the radar's Constant false alarm rate detector and be incorrectly reported as targets (known as false alarms). The role of the radar tracker is to monitor consecutive updates from the radar system (which typically occur once every few seconds, as the antenna rotates) and to determine those sequences of plots belonging to the same target, whilst rejecting any plots believed to be false alarms. In addition, the radar tracker is {{able to use the}} sequence of plots to estimate the current speed and heading of the target. When several targets are present, the radar tracker aims to provide one track for each target, with the track history often being used to indicate where the target has come from.|$|E
50|$|Amblyaudia is {{a deficit}} in {{binaural}} integration of environmental information entering the auditory system. It is a disorder related to brain organization and function {{rather than what}} is typically considered a “hearing loss” (damage to the cochlea). It may be genetic or developmentally acquired or both. When animals are temporarily deprived of hearing from an early age, profound changes occur in the brain. Specifically, cell sizes in brainstem nuclei are reduced, the configuration of brainstem dendrites are altered and neurons respond in different ways to sounds presented to both the deprived and non-deprived ears (in cases of asymmetric deprivation). This last point is particularly important for listening tasks that require inputs from two ears to perform well. There are multiple auditory functions that rely on the computation of well calibrated inputs from the two ears. Chief among these {{is the ability to}} localize sound sources and separate what {{we want to hear from}} a <b>background</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise.</b> In the brainstem, the auditory system compares the timing and levels of sounds between the two ears to encode the location of sound sources (sounds that originate from our right as opposed to left side are louder and arrive earlier in our right ear). This ability to separate sound sources not only helps us locate the trajectories of moving objects, but also to separate different sound sources in noisy environments.|$|E

30|$|To {{modulate}} signals, transmitters couple {{the base}} band signal with sine wave carriers, pulse trains, repeating spreading, hoping sequences, or cyclic prefixes which result in built-in periodicity. Thus, a modulated signal is characterized as cyclostationary since its statistics, mean and autocorrelation, exhibit periodicity. This feature can be extracted and analyzed using Fourier analysis. In communications, this periodicity is introduced intentionally {{so that a}} receiver can estimate several parameters such as carrier phase, pulse timing, or direction of arrival[22 – 24]. In CR networks, this periodicity is the feature for detecting a random signal with a particular modulation type in a <b>background</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> and other modulated signals[25].|$|E

As we can see from Fig. 2 b, the maximum peaks of the characteristic frequencies are clearly distinguished on the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise.</b> The most intensive are the peaks at frequencies 0.88 and 1.7  Hz which correspond to the frequencies of the most notable changes in the optical characteristics of the solution. The steady component is not shown on the graph {{in order to improve}} the perception. The comparison of the obtained data with the theoretical and experimental studies [13 – 16, 18, 19] shows that the results are in the range of the characteristic frequencies of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) electrolyte mixing. The maximum of 1.7  Hz is much lower than the first one of 0.88  Hz and perhaps is the second harmonic. The second harmonic in this case can be generated due to nonuniformity of the rotational motion of electrolyte and to the nonlinearity of the camera CCD matrix.|$|E
