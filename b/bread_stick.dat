40|$|The aim was {{to compare}} the {{movements}} of the mandible during chewing different food types. We hypothesized that the mandibular movements would vary significantly between the food types. For each participant, we built and affixed the dental appliances and attached infra red emitting diodes to record the mandibular movements using a 3 D motion capture device (Optotrak). Participants chewed on four test foods that varied in texture: Italian <b>bread</b> <b>stick,</b> dried beef stick, carrot and cheese. Results indicated greater amplitude of the lateral displacement of the mandibular movements when chewing cheese. The velocity of the lateral displacement was greater for soft foods such as cheese. The velocity of the horizontal displacement increased during beef chewing. Furthermore, we found shorter movement cycle duration while chewing carrot. We concluded that {{the movements of the}} mandible vary significantly during chewing different food types...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to apply the {{protocol}} for the shelf life prediction of bakery products proposed by Calligaris and others (2007 a) on <b>bread</b> <b>sticks.</b> The methodology comprises 4 steps: (1) evaluation of the physical properties of fat; (2) performing the accelerated shelf life test, (3) evaluation of sensory acceptance limit and the relevant chemical index limit; (4) setting up the shelf life, prediction model. The results allow validating the shelf life prediction methodology proposed. In fact, the peroxide number was found to be a representative index of the quality depletion of <b>bread</b> <b>sticks</b> during their shelf life. In addition, once again by accounting for the changes in the fat physical state, it is possible to set up a modified Arrhenius equation able to describe the temperature dependence of peroxide formation.

40|$|Fried <b>bread</b> <b>sticks</b> (FBS) {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely {{consumed}} deep fried food products in China. Understanding the fat and moisture content in FBS will help consumers make healthy food choices as well as assist food processors to provide FBS with desirable quality. Rapid Fourier transform near-infrared methods (FT-NIR) were developed for determining fat and moisture content in FBS collected from 123 different vendors in Shanghai, China. FBS samples with minimum sample preparation (either finely or coarsely ground) were used for NIR analyses. Spectra of FBS were treated with different mathematic pretreatments before being used to build models between the spectral information and fat (7. 71 %– 30. 89 %) or moisture (17. 39 %– 32. 65 %) content in FBS. Finely ground samples may lead to slightly more robust PLS models, but the particle sizes of ground FBS samples did not seriously affect the predictability of the models with appropriate mathematical treatments. The fat and moisture content in FBS predicted by FT-NIR methods had very good correlation with their values determined via traditional methods (fat, R 2 = 0. 965; moisture, R 2 = 0. 983), which clearly indicated that FT-NIR methods could be used as an effective tool for rapid determination of fat and moisture content in FBS...|$|R
