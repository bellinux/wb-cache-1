6000|$|We {{have thus}} {{completed}} {{the list of}} the materials of architectural decoration, and the reader may be assured that no effort has ever been successful to draw elements of beauty from any other sources than these. Such an effort was once resolutely made. It was contrary to the religion of the Arab to introduce any animal form into his ornament; but although all the radiance of color, all the refinements of proportion, and all the intricacies of geometrical design were open to him, he could not produce any noble work without an abstraction of the forms of leafage, to be used in his capitals, and made the ground plan of his chased ornament. But I have above noted that coloring is an entirely distinct and independent art; and in the [...] "Seven Lamps" [...] we saw that this art had most power when practised in arrangements of simple geometrical form: the Arab, therefore, lay under no disadvantage in coloring, and he had all the noble elements of constructive and proportional beauty at his command: he might not imitate the sea-shell, but he could build the dome. The imitation of radiance by the variegated voussoir, the expression of the sweep of the desert by the <b>barred</b> <b>red</b> lines upon the wall, the starred inshedding of light through his vaulted roof, and all the endless fantasy of abstract line,[69] were still in the power of his ardent and fantastic spirit. Much he achieved; and yet in the effort of his overtaxed invention, restrained from its proper food, he made his architecture a glittering vacillation of undisciplined enchantment, and left the lustre of its edifices to wither like a startling dream, whose beauty we may indeed feel, and whose instruction we may receive, but must smile at its inconsistency, and mourn over its evanescence.|$|E

40|$|In 3 experiments, pigeons {{acquired}} a discrimination between patterns comprising the same features. Thus vertical green <b>bars</b> beside horizontal <b>red</b> <b>bars</b> might have signaled food, and horizontal green <b>bars</b> beside vertical <b>red</b> <b>bars</b> might have signaled no food. The solution of this discrimination {{can be explained}} by assuming each pattern is represented either by a template or by structural features that are sensitive to combinations of color and line orientation. The 1 st explanation predicts subjects should react to a training pattern rotated 90 ° {{in the same way as}} the pattern on which it is based. The 2 nd explanation predicts these patterns should be treated as if they signal opposing outcomes. The experiments confirmed the 2 nd of these predictions.
