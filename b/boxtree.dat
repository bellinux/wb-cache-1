40|$|A {{new class}} of data {{structures}} called “bumptrees ” is described. These structures are useful for efficiently implementing a number of neural network related operations. An empirical comparison with radial basis functions is presented on a robot arm mapping learning task. Applica-tions to density estimation, classification, and constraint representation and learning are also outlined. 1 WHAT IS A BUMPTREE? A bumptree is a new geometric data structure which is useful for efficiently learning, rep-resenting, and evaluating geometric relationships {{in a variety of}} contexts. They are a natural generalization of several hierarchical geometric data structures including oct-trees, k-d trees, balltrees and <b>boxtrees.</b> They are useful for many geometric learning tasks including approximating functions, constraint surfaces, classification regions, and probability densi-ties from samples. In the function approximation case, the approach is related to radial basis function neural networks, but supports faster construction, faster access, and more flexibl...|$|R

Presented as if written {{around the year}} 2260, the time {{when most of the}} Babylon 5 series takes place, the book contains many recipes for the various foods mentioned and seen throughout the series. Included are recipes for Narn-style spoo and Centauri-style spoo, both using currently available ingredients, with sea scallops taking the place of spoo. Straczynski claims that while dining in a restaurant prior to the 1996 Hugo award ceremony, [...] "a fan had the waiter bring over a tray of food, christened spoo".|$|E
40|$|A box-tree is a bounding-box {{hierarchy}} {{that uses}} axis-aligned boxes as bounding volumes. The stabbing number of a box-tree {{with respect to}} a given type of query is the maximum number of nodes visited when answering such a query. We describe several new algorithms to construct box-trees with small stabbing number with respect to queries with axisparallel boxes and with points. We also prove lower bounds on the worst-case stabbing number for <b>boxtrees,</b> which show that our results are optimal or close to optimal. Finally, we present algorithms to convert box-trees to R-trees, resulting in R-trees with (almost) optimal stabbing number. 1 Introduction Motivation and problem statement.

2500|$|During the early-to-mid-1990s, Dark Horse Comics {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the Shadow from Condé Nast. It published the Shadow [...] miniseries The Shadow: In the Coils of Leviathan (four issues) in 1993, and The Shadow: Hell's Heat Wave (three issues) in 1995. In the Coils of Leviathan was later collected by Dark Horse in 1994 as a trade paperback. Both series were written by Joel Goss and Michael Kaluta, and drawn by Gary Gianni. A one-shot Shadow issue The Shadow and the Mysterious Three was also published by Dark Horse in 1994, again written by Joel Goss and Michael Kaluta, with Stan Manoukian and Vince Roucher taking over the illustration duties but working from Kaluta's layouts. A comics adaptation of the 1994 film The Shadow was published in two issues by Dark Horse as part of the movie's merchandising campaign. The script was by Goss and Kaluta and drawn by Kaluta. It was collected and published in England by <b>Boxtree</b> as a graphic novel tie-in for the film's British release. Emulating DC's earlier team-up, Dark Horse also published a two-issue mini-series in 1995 called The Shadow and Doc Savage: The Case of the Shrieking Skeletons. It was written by Steve Vance, and illustrated by Manoukian and Roucher. Both issues' covers were drawn by Rocketeer creator Dave Stevens. A final Dark Horse Shadow team-up was published in 1995: the single issue Ghost and the Shadow, written by Doug Moench, pencilled by H. M. Baker, and inked by Bernard Kolle.|$|E
