5|$|Banquo is in a {{third of}} the play's scenes, as both a human and a ghost. As {{significant}} as he is to the plot, he has fewer lines than the relatively insignificant Ross, a Scottish nobleman who survives the play. In the second scene of the play, King Duncan describes the manner in which Macbeth, Thane of Glamis, and Banquo, Thane of Lochaber, bravely led his army against invaders, fighting side <b>by</b> <b>side.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> next scene, Banquo and Macbeth, returning from the battle together, encounter the Three Witches, who predict that Macbeth will become Thane of Cawdor, and then king. Banquo, sceptical of the witches, challenges them to predict his own future, and they foretell that Banquo will never himself take the throne, but will beget a line of kings. Banquo remains sceptical after the encounter, wondering aloud if evil can ever speak the truth. He warns Macbeth that evil will offer men a small, hopeful truth only to catch them in a deadly trap.|$|E

25|$|The Ship 1 {{prototype}} registration NX41860 had an open cockpit, {{an enclosed}} fuselage for the Franklin piston engine, and fixed three-wheel landing gear. The engine drove a two-bladed main rotor and a two-bladed anti-torque tail rotor. The prototype crashed in September 1943 and was subsequently modified with several improvements, including an enclosed cabin {{for the pilot}} and passenger, who sat side <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cockpit. With all the lessons learned, the third prototype {{became the basis for}} the production model, the Bell Model 47. The Model 30 Ship 1A, Genevieve, is now on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.|$|E
25|$|The T3M {{was a large}} single-engined biplane {{capable of}} being fitted with either a {{conventional}} tailwheel undercarriage or floats. The fuselage was constructed of welded steel tube {{in place of the}} riveted steel frame of the CS/SC, with the pilot and bombardier seated side <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front cockpit situated forward of the wing, with the bombardier having a position under the nose for aiming the aircraft's bombs or torpedoes, while the gunner had a cockpit well aft of the wing, with a radiator slung under the top wing between the cockpits. Power was from a 575hp (429kW) Wright T-3B V-12 engine. 24 T3M-1s were built.|$|E
25|$|The Whitley had {{a crew of}} five: a pilot, co-pilot/navigator, a bomb aimer, a {{wireless}} operator, and a rear gunner. The pilot and second pilot/navigator sat side <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cockpit, with the wireless operator further back. The navigator rotated to use the chart table behind him. The bomb aimer position was in the nose with a gun turret located directly above. The fuselage aft of the wireless operator was divided horizontally by the bomb bay; behind the bomb bay was the main entrance and aft of that the rear turret. The offensive armaments were stowed in two separate bomb bays housed within the fuselage, along with a further 14 smaller cells contained within the wing area. Bomb racks capable of holding larger bombs were installed on the Whitley Mk III variant.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, since racing cars {{were no longer}} {{required}} to carry a mechanic, Alfa Romeo built the first single seater race car. As a first attempt, the 1931 Monoposto Tipo A used a pair of 6-cylinder engines fitted side <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chassis. As the resulting car was too heavy and complex, Jano designed a more suitable and successful racer called Monoposto Tipo B (aka P3) for the 1932 Grand Prix season. The Tipo B proved itself the winning car of its era, winning straight from its first outing at the 1932 Italian Grand Prix, and was powered with an enlarged version of the 8C engine now at 2,665cc, fed through a pair of superchargers instead of a single one.|$|E

500|$|During {{spawning}} season, the fins and {{underside of}} male bowfin often {{change in color}} to a bright lime green. The courtship/spawning sequence lasts one to three hours, and can repeat up to five times. Courtship begins when a female approaches the nest. [...] The ritual consists of intermittent nose bites, nudges, and chasing behavior by the male until the female becomes receptive, at which time the pair lie side <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nest. [...] She deposits her eggs while he shakes his fins in a vibratory movement, and releases his milt for fertilization to occur. A male often has eggs {{from more than one}} female in his nest, and a single female often spawns in several nests.|$|E

500|$|Smilodon started {{developing}} its adult saber-teeth when the animal turned one-and-a-half years of age, {{shortly after the}} completion of the eruption of the cat's baby teeth. Both baby and adult canines would be present side <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouth for an 11-month period, and the muscles used in making the powerful bite were developed at about one-and-a-half years old as well, eight months earlier than in a modern lion. After Smilodon turned around 20 months of age, the infant teeth were shed while the adult canines grew at an average growth rate of [...] per month during a 12-month period. They reached their full size at around 3 years of age, later than for modern species of big cat. Juvenile and adolescent Smilodon specimens are extremely rare at Rancho La Brea, where the study was performed, indicating that they remained hidden or at denning sites during hunts, and depended on parental care while their canines were developing.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-20th century, the {{originality}} of {{the approach}} of the architectural historian Colin Rowe had the effect of re-situating the assessment of modern architecture within history and acknowledged the Palladian architecture as an active influence. In the later 20th century, when Rowe's influence had spread worldwide, this approach had become a key element in the process of architectural and urban design. If [...] "the presence of the past" [...] was evident in the work of many architects in the late 20th century, from James Stirling to Aldo Rossi, Robert Venturi, Oswald Matthias Ungers, Peter Eisenman, Michael Graves and others, this was largely due to the influence of Rowe. Colin Rowe's unorthodox and non-chronological view of history then made it possible for him to develop theoretical formulations such as his famous essay [...] "The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa" [...] (1947) in which he theorised that there were compositional [...] "rules" [...] in Palladio’s villas that could be demonstrated to correspond to similar [...] "rules" [...] in Le Corbusier’s villas at Poissy and Garches. This approach enabled Rowe to elaborate an astonishingly fresh and provocative trans-historical assessment of both Palladio and Le Corbusier, in which the architecture of both was assessed not in chronological time, but side <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present moment.|$|E
500|$|To mix the tracks, a Sony Oxford Console was used. Audio {{engineer}} Mick Guzauski {{explained to}} SoundByte {{that he used}} the console's [...] "Automated EQ feature" [...] on the tracks. He {{said that he could}} [...] "tailor the frequency responses and dynamics within each song with optimum equalizer at every pitch and level." [...] For the Afanasieff tracks, the background vocals and overdubs were accomplished on the Oxford console at his Wally World StudioB, at San Rafael, California. Simpson's label-mate and Latin singer Marc Anthony is featured as a guest vocalist on the ballad [...] "There You Were". Simpson met Anthony at the taping of the TV special A Christmas in Washington in 2000. They talked to each other, and proposed recording a song on both of their next albums. They sang the song side <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio and the whole song was completed within six hours. [...] "Forever in Your Eyes" [...] {{was one of the first}} songs to be recorded for the album, and was produced by Rhett Lawrence. It was recorded at Sony Music Studios within two hours. Rodney Jerkins, who was acquainted with Mottola, produced two cuts on Irresistible. In an interview with Sony Music Japan, Simpson said that she never met Jerkins in person. He produced and recorded the songs' music and sent the tape to Columbia, from which [...] "Imagination" [...] and [...] "I Never" [...] were selected. Cory Rooney produced Simpson's vocals and Tony Maserati mixed the vocals. Initially, Simpson did not want to record [...] "What's It Gonna Be" [...] as she felt the line [...] "Are you gonna be a dog or a gentleman" [...] was a little awkward. However, due to her record label's persuasion, she recorded the song and ultimately became fond of it. In order to record the title track, Simpson traveled to Murlyn Music Studios, in Sweden. [...] "A Little Bit" [...] was produced by Ric Wake; although he produced many songs for the album, only [...] "A Little Bit" [...] made the final cut. The Japanese version of the album contains a bonus track—the Hex Hector remix of [...] "Irresistible"—for which Simpson re-recorded her vocals.|$|E
