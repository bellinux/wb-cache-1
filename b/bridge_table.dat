25|$|For years Kaplan {{served on}} (and chaired) regional, {{national}} and international bridge organizations in a largely successful effort to publicize the nature of ethical bridge play and {{to bring it to}} the <b>bridge</b> <b>table.</b> He chaired the ACBL’s National Laws Commission for many years and was an ACBL delegate to the World Bridge Federation, often chairing its Appeals Committee.|$|E

25|$|In Canton, Price met Doctor Sun Yat-sen, {{who later}} became the first President of the Republic of China. They became good friends and often {{discussed}} politics over the <b>bridge</b> <b>table.</b> Their friendship continued even after Price was reassigned to Fuzhou where he served as United States consul. Sun Yat-sen personally invited both Price and his wife to his inauguration ceremony staged by the Nationalist government. The United States did not recognize the Nationalist government, choosing instead to retain official ties with the rival government in Peking. Therefore, Price could not attend a Nationalist-sponsored ceremony. Mrs. Price, however, was not a Government official so she did attend, and her detailed report of the event was passed to the United States Department of State in a formal dispatch.|$|E
500|$|Laurens Hammond {{graduated}} from Cornell University with a mechanical engineering degree in 1916. By {{the start of}} the 1920s, he had designed a spring-driven clock, which provided enough sales for him to start his own business, the Hammond Clock Company, in 1928. As well as clocks, his early inventions included three-dimensional glasses and an automatic <b>bridge</b> <b>table</b> shuffler. However, as the Great Depression continued into the 1930s, sales of the <b>bridge</b> <b>table</b> declined and he decided to look elsewhere for a commercially successful product. Hammond was inspired to create the tonewheel or [...] "phonic wheel" [...] by listening to the moving gears of his electric clocks and the tones produced by them. He gathered pieces from a second-hand piano he had purchased for $15 and combined it with a tonewheel generator in a similar form to the telharmonium, albeit much shorter and more compact. Since Hammond was not a musician, he asked the company's assistant treasurer, W. L. Lahey, to help him achieve the desired organ sound. To cut costs, Hammond made a pedalboard with only 25 notes, instead of the standard 32 on church organs, and it quickly became a de facto standard.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{characters}} of Reese and Schapiro were very different. At the <b>bridge</b> <b>table</b> Reese was the cold calculating machine, driven by logic, but witty and good-natured away from it, though with an acerbic phrase when needed. Schapiro was the player of flair; excitable, {{always on the}} move, irascible {{at the table and}} often grumpy away from it. He did not mellow with old age. At the 1999 European Senior Teams, opponents who called the referee in a vain attempt to protect Schapiro's partner from verbal abuse were told there were special dispensations in standards of behaviour for any competitor over the age of 90." ...|$|E

60|$|Ennison {{thought so}} too {{half an hour}} later, when having cut out {{from one of the}} <b>bridge</b> <b>tables</b> he settled down for a chat with Annabel.

2500|$|For example, {{although}} the magazine’s focus is contract bridge, discussions of other {{topics such as}} the subjunctive mood and the Battle of Waterloo {{found their way into}} its pages under Kaplan’s editorship. Issues of grammar, including gender and punctuation, arose because readers, accustomed to viewing TBW as what one termed a “haven of careful prose,” would write to complain about what they perceived as some misuse of English. These readers received a usually friendly, but occasionally testy, tutorial in the finer points of grammar and diction. (The topic of Waterloo arose in a lengthy, cogent and fascinating discussion of the difference between “subsequent” and “consequent,” as applied to results at the <b>bridge</b> <b>table.)</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|The group's alibi {{of playing}} bridge all evening is ruined when the Inspector notices a playing card {{on the floor}} across the room from the <b>bridge</b> <b>table.</b> A full deck of cards is needed to {{properly}} play bridge. Therefore, the Inspector knows the group {{could not have been}} playing several consecutive hands of bridge that evening. This is similar to an attempted alibi in the short story [...] "King of Clubs," [...] which appears in 'Poirot's Early Cases'. A family claims that they have been playing bridge all night and therefore cannot be involved in a murder that has occurred in their neighbour's house. Poirot sees through this lie after he discovers a card (the King of Clubs) is missing from the pack on the table. This discovery proves the family's alibi of playing bridge was false and they have lied about their whereabouts that evening.|$|E
2500|$|The {{problem of}} a weak case against Ethel Rosenberg was solved just 10 days {{before the start of}} the trial when David and Ruth Greenglass were reinterviewed. They were persuaded to change their {{original}} stories. David had said that he'd passed the atomic data he'd collected to Julius on a New York street corner. Now he stated that he'd given this information to Julius in the living room of the Rosenberg's New York apartment and that Ethel, at Julius's request, had taken his notes and [...] "typed them up." [...] In her re-interview Ruth expanded on her husband's version: [...] "Julius then took the info into the bathroom and read it and when he came out he called Ethel and told her she had to type this info immediately... Ethel then sat down at the typewriter which she placed on a <b>bridge</b> <b>table</b> in the living room and proceeded to type the info which David had given to Julius." [...] As a result of this new testimony, all charges against Ruth were dropped.|$|E
60|$|They all drifted {{presently}} {{back to the}} <b>bridge</b> <b>tables.</b> Norgate, however, excused himself. He {{had some}} letters to write, he declared, and presently he withdrew to the little drawing-room. In {{about a quarter of}} an hour, as he had expected, the door opened, and Selingman entered. He crossed the room at once to where Norgate was writing and laid his hand upon his shoulder.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Rheinholdt's reception, {{notwithstanding}} the temporary absence of its presiding spirit, was without doubt an unqualified success. In {{one of the}} distant rooms the younger people were dancing. There were <b>bridge</b> <b>tables,</b> {{all of which were}} occupied, and for those who preferred the more old-fashioned pastime of conversation amongst luxurious surroundings, there was still ample space and opportunity. Philip Rheinholdt, with a pretty young débutante upon his arm, came out from the dancing room and looked around amongst the little knots of people.|$|R
2500|$|In 1997 Phillip and Robert King {{published}} {{a collection of}} bridge-related short stories entitled Your Deal, Mr. Bond was published by B. T. Batsford (...) [...] The title piece is a short story featuring James Bond, who is assigned by M to defeat a villain named Saladin who is threatening to explode nuclear bombs in several major cities. Bond impersonates real-life bridge expert Zia Mahmood in order to combat Saladin at the <b>bridge</b> <b>table.</b> The short story includes bridge game charts {{in a similar fashion}} to that used by Ian Fleming in Moonraker, in which Bond similarly plays a high-stakes game of bridge against that novel's villain. The book, despite being issued by a major publisher and containing undisguised references to the Bond characters, contains no reference to Ian Fleming Publications, suggesting the use of Bond, M and Miss Moneypenny is unofficial, and rendering this story likely apocryphal. Its placement in the Bond canon, therefore, is unknown. The story contains a cultural reference to Star Trek, however, which sets it outside of Fleming's timeline. It {{should not be confused with}} the 1987 John Gardner Bond novel, No Deals, Mr. Bond.|$|E

60|$|After dinner, Dominey's guests passed {{naturally}} {{enough to}} the relaxations which each preferred. There were two <b>bridge</b> <b>tables,</b> Terniloff and the Cabinet Minister played billiards, and Seaman, with a touch which amazed every one, drew strange music from the yellow keys of the old-fashioned grand piano in the drawing-room. Stephanie and her host made a slow progress through the hall and picture gallery. For some time their conversation was engaged solely with the objects to which Dominey drew his companion's attention. When they had passed out of possible hearing, however, {{of any of the}} other guests, Stephanie's fingers tightened upon her companion's arm.|$|R

60|$|Grantham, who {{had been}} unusually silent {{throughout}} the service of dinner, slipped away from the room {{a few minutes before}} the other men. He found Letitia arranging a <b>bridge</b> <b>table,</b> and drew her a little on one side.|$|E
60|$|She talked {{more than}} usual at dinner-time, but {{afterwards}} she spoke of a headache, {{and sat on the}} window-seat of the library, a cigarette between her lips, her eyes half closed. When the <b>bridge</b> <b>table</b> was laid out, she turned her head languidly.|$|E
50|$|A {{submersible}} bridge {{is a type}} of movable bridge that lowers the bridge deck below the water level to permit waterborne traffic to use the waterway. This differs from a lift <b>bridge</b> or <b>table</b> <b>bridge,</b> which operate by raising the roadway. Two {{submersible bridge}}s exist across the Corinth Canal, one at each end, in Isthmia and Corinth. They lower the centre span to 8 metres below water level when they give way to ships crossing the channel.|$|R

60|$|We sat a {{long time}} over dinner. Eve was between a cousin of mine--who {{was a member of}} Parliament, a master of foxhounds, and in his way quite a {{distinguished}} person--and the old Earl of Enterdean, my godfather; and they were both of them obviously her abject slaves. No one seemed in the least inclined to move and it was nearly eleven o'clock before we passed into the private room I had engaged, where coffee and some <b>bridge</b> <b>tables</b> awaited us. We broke up there into little groups. I left Eve talking to my sister and {{was on my way to}} try to get near her father when the Countess of Enterdean, a perfectly charming old lady who had known me from boyhood, intercepted me.|$|R
50|$|The {{submersible}} bridge's primary {{advantage over}} the similar lift bridge {{is that there is}} no structure above the shipping channel and thus no height limitation on ship traffic. This is particularly important for sailing vessels. Additionally, the lack of an above-deck structure is considered aesthetically pleasing, a similarity shared with the Chicago-style bascule <b>bridge</b> and the <b>table</b> <b>bridge.</b> However, the presence of the submerged bridge structure limits the draft of vessels in the waterway.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>table</b> <b>bridge</b> is a {{moveable}} bridge {{in which the}} deck moves along the vertical axis. Hydraulic pillars under the bridge raise the bridge deck to allow barge traffic to pass beneath it. In contrast to a lift bridge, where the deck is pulled upwards along towers, {{the deck of a}} <b>table</b> <b>bridge</b> is pushed upwards by otherwise hidden pillars. The name originates from the fact that when open it resembles a table.|$|R
