5|$|Gone to Coney Island and <b>Booming</b> Business are two 1910 American silent short comedy {{productions}} by the Thanhouser Company. Both {{were released}} {{together on a}} single film reel on July 5, 1910. Gone to Coney Island is a comedy that features Coney Island, which the mere subject would make for a successful film. <b>Booming</b> Business {{may have been the}} very type of slapstick comedy that Edwin Thanhouser specifically said the Thanhouser Company would not produce. The productions of both films have no credits for the cast or crew, but possible candidates for these roles exist. Reviews of the films favored Gone to Coney Island, but some reviewers specifically refused to explain the plot because Coney Island subjects were deemed self-explanatory. <b>Booming</b> Business received one detailed review in The New York Dramatic Mirror which was negative. The films are presumed lost.|$|E

Yet such rains reduce temperatures and can replenish groundwater tables, rivers.|$|E

In April, he learned of the success of Nintendo's Donkey Kong video game and sent Robert Hadl, vice president of legislative matters, to investigate. Hadl's analysis was that Donkey Kongs storyline was based on that of King Kong and was thus an infringement of Universal's rights to that film's characters and scenario.|$|E

5|$|Jabba the Hutt only speaks Huttese on film, but {{his lines}} are subtitled in English. His voice and Huttese-language {{dialogue}} were performed by voice actor Larry Ward, {{whose work is}} not listed in the end credits. A heavy, <b>booming</b> quality was given to Ward's voice by pitching it an octave lower than normal and processing it through a subharmonic generator. A soundtrack of wet, slimy sound effects was recorded to accompany {{the movement of the}} puppet's limbs and mouth.|$|E

5|$|The Rock Island Railroad {{built the}} first {{railroad}} bridge across the Mississippi River in 1856. It connected Davenport to Rock Island, Illinois. This railway connection resulted in significant improvements to transportation and commerce with Chicago, a <b>booming</b> 19th-century city. The addition of new railroad lines to Muscatine and Iowa City, and the acquisition of other lines by the Rock Island Railroad, resulted in Davenport becoming a commercial railroad hub.|$|E

5|$|The {{first few}} years of the {{federation}} were characterised by a relatively peaceful political atmosphere and a <b>booming</b> economy. The government's coffers were kept full through revenue from Northern Rhodesia's copper mines, and overseas investment saw the rapid expansion of the cities of Salisbury, Bulawayo and Lusaka. High-standard tar roads replaced dirt tracks and the railway system was expanded. Welensky credited the high rate of development to the astute management of the federal Minister of Finance, Donald Macintyre.|$|E
5|$|The {{most popular}} {{subjects}} {{of this type}} include the Flight into Egypt and the plight of hermits such as Saints Jerome and Anthony. As well as connecting the style to the later Age of Discovery, the role of Antwerp as a <b>booming</b> centre both of world trade and cartography, and the wealthy town-dweller's view of the countryside, art historians have explored the paintings as religious metaphors for the pilgrimage of life.|$|E

The <b>boom</b> is designed to mount on the bed of a pick-up truck and elevate the radiometer system 8 meters above the ground and 4 meters away from the truck.

5|$|A workhouse {{was built}} in Lurgan and opened in 1841 under the stipulations of the Poor Law which stated that each Poor Law Union would build a workhouse to give relief to the {{increasing}} numbers of destitute poor. In 1821 the population of Lurgan was 2,715, this increased to 4,677 by 1841. There {{were a couple of}} reasons for this large growth in population. Firstly the opportunities provided by the <b>booming</b> linen industry led many to abandon their meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan in the hope of gaining employment. Secondly the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in the construction of new buildings such as Brownlow House.|$|E
5|$|After the Revolution, Boone resettled in Limestone (renamed Maysville, Kentucky in 1786), then a <b>booming</b> Ohio River port. In 1787, he {{was elected}} to the Virginia state {{assembly}} as a representative from Bourbon County. In Maysville, he kept a tavern and worked as a surveyor, horse trader, and land speculator. He was initially prosperous, owning seven slaves by 1787, a relatively large number for Kentucky at the time. Boone became a celebrity while living in Maysville. In 1784, on his 50th birthday, historian John Filson published The Discovery, Settlement And present State of Kentucke, a book which included a chronicle of Boone's adventures.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the States Reorganisation Act (1956), Mangalore (part of the Madras Presidency until this time) was {{incorporated}} into the dominion of the newly created Mysore State (now called Karnataka). Mangalore is the fourth largest city of Karnataka in terms of population, and eighth largest port of India, providing Karnataka with access to the Arabian Sea coastline. Mangalore experienced significant growth in the decades 1970–80, with the opening of New Mangalore Port in 1974 and commissioning of Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers Limited in 1976. Today, the Mangalore region is a nationally known higher education hub with a flourishing service sector, particularly in medical services, a small but growing IT regional hub, and a <b>booming</b> real estate and banking industry.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{summarize}} the most recent sonic <b>boom</b> laboratory studies performed at NASA-LaRC using the Sonic <b>Boom</b> Simulator. The first used synthesized idealized outdoor <b>boom</b> shapes which were filtered to represent <b>booms</b> heard inside a house. The test explored the efficacy of various metrics in assessing both loudness and annoyance responses to these <b>booms.</b> The second test investigated the effects of adding single reflections to idealized <b>boom</b> signatures, and the third compared <b>booms</b> recorded from real aircraft with idealized <b>boom</b> signatures to determine if subjects rated the real <b>booms</b> differently. In these studies, as in previous studies performed at NASA-LaRC, there was a continuing effort to evaluate metrics for predicting the subjective effects of sonic <b>booms...</b>|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the city}} of Galveston was a <b>booming</b> {{metropolis}} with a population of 37,000. Its position on the natural harbor of Galveston Bay along the Gulf of Mexico made it the center of trade in Texas, and one of the largest cotton ports in the nation, in competition with New Orleans. Between 1838 and 1842, 18 newspapers were started to serve the island's rapidly growing population (The Galveston County Daily News is the sole survivor). A causeway linking the island with the mainland was finished in 1860, which paved the way for railroad expansion.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the cotton {{industry}} was <b>booming.</b> The crop made up 69% of the agricultural business in the region. Livestock production was <b>booming,</b> as was poultry production, especially chicken. In addition, the shipping of agricultural goods and livestock was the other main business in Cooper. The First National Bank was rebuilt in 1909 and became an important factor in Cooper's economy. In the 1910s, potatoes become {{an important part of the}} economy due to the sudden drop in the livestock business. In 1926, the cotton crop failed and Cooper's economy plummeted. Many of Cooper's inhabitants became deep in debt as the price of crops plummeted. The lumber businesses had exhausted the regions resources, forcing most of them to go out of business. Many people moved away to find new work. The local economy stabilized in the mid-1930s, and cotton, potato, and corn production began to rise. The growing of oats, however, had ended. In addition, the railroad going through Cooper had failed a few years before, so the shipping industry in Cooper was struggling. Cotton and alfalfa carried Cooper's economy through the 1950s and 1960s, until the shift to the growing of wheat in the 1970s. Cooper reported 60 businesses in the 1970s, more than half of which were dairies. During the 1980s and 1990s, Cooper's economy shifted to the manufacturing and shipping of local goods, and in 1991, Cooper had 70 businesses.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, Kraków had 120 officially {{registered}} synagogues {{and prayer}} houses that spanned across the old city. Much of Jewish intellectual life {{had moved to}} new centres like Podgórze. This in turn, led to the redevelopment and renovation of much of Kazimierz {{and the development of}} new districts in Kraków. Most historic buildings in central Kazimierz today are preserved in their original form. Some old buildings however, were not repaired after the devastation brought by the Second World War, and have remained empty. Most recent efforts at restoring the historic neighborhoods gained new impetus around 1993. Kazimierz is now a well-visited area, seeing a <b>booming</b> growth in Jewish-themed restaurants, bars, bookstores and souvenir shops.|$|E
