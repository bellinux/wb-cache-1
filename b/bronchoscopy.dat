5|$|Several {{treatments}} can {{be administered}} via <b>bronchoscopy</b> {{for the management}} of airway obstruction or bleeding. If an airway becomes obstructed by cancer growth, options include rigid <b>bronchoscopy,</b> balloon bronchoplasty, stenting, and microdebridement.

5|$|Rapid {{diagnosis}} and treatment are important {{in the care of}} TBI; if the injury is not diagnosed shortly after the injury, the risk of complications is higher. <b>Bronchoscopy</b> is the most effective method to diagnose, locate, and determine the severity of TBI, and it is usually the only method that allows a definitive diagnosis. Diagnosis with a flexible bronchoscope, which allows the injury to be visualized directly, is the fastest and most reliable technique.

40|$|In 2009, {{a lethal}} case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), {{acquired}} by a US soldier in Afghanistan, was treated at a {{medical center in}} Germany and resulted in nosocomial transmission to 2 health care providers (HCPs). After his arrival at the medical center (day 6 of illness) by aeromedical evacuation, the patient required repetitive <b>bronchoscopies</b> to control severe pulmonary hemorrhage and renal and hepatic dialysis for hepatorenal failure. After showing clinical improvement, the patient died suddenly on day 11 of illness from cerebellar tonsil herniation caused by cerebral/cerebellar edema. The 2 infected HCPs were among 16 HCPs who received ribavirin postexposure prophylaxis. The infected HCPs had mild or no CCHF symptoms. Transmission may have occurred during bag-valve-mask ventilation, breaches in personal protective equipment during resuscitations, or <b>bronchoscopies</b> generating infectious aerosols.

5|$|Performing a chest {{radiograph}} {{is one of}} {{the first}} investigative steps if a person reports symptoms that may suggest lung cancer. This may reveal an obvious mass, widening of the mediastinum (suggestive of spread to lymph nodes there), atelectasis (collapse), consolidation (pneumonia) or pleural effusion. CT imaging is typically used to provide more information about the type and extent of disease. <b>Bronchoscopy</b> or CT-guided biopsy is often used to sample the tumor for histopathology.|$|E
5|$|TBI is {{frequently}} difficult to diagnose and treat. Early diagnosis {{is important to}} prevent complications, which include stenosis (narrowing) of the airway, respiratory tract infection, and damage to the lung tissue. Diagnosis involves procedures such as <b>bronchoscopy,</b> radiography, and x-ray computed tomography to visualize the tracheobronchial tree. Signs and symptoms vary based on the location and severity of the injury; they commonly include dyspnea (difficulty breathing), dysphonia (a condition where the voice can be hoarse, weak, or excessively breathy), coughing, and abnormal breath sounds. In the emergency setting, tracheal intubation {{can be used to}} ensure that the airway remains open. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair a TBI.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} (85%) {{of cases of}} lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 10–15% of cases occur in {{people who have never}} smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by <b>bronchoscopy</b> or CT-guidance.|$|E

5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} in {{the emergency}} setting can be difficult with the fiberoptic bronchoscope due to blood, vomit, or secretions in the airway and poor patient cooperation. Because of this, patients with massive facial injury, complete upper airway obstruction, severely diminished ventilation, or profuse upper airway bleeding are poor candidates for fiberoptic intubation. Fiberoptic intubation under general anesthesia typically requires two skilled individuals. Success rates of only 83–87% have been reported using fiberoptic techniques {{in the emergency}} department, with significant nasal bleeding occurring in up to 22% of patients. These drawbacks limit the use of fiberoptic <b>bronchoscopy</b> somewhat in urgent and emergency situations.|$|E
5|$|Certain medical {{procedures}} can also injure the airways; these include tracheal intubation, <b>bronchoscopy,</b> and tracheotomy. The {{back of the}} trachea may be damaged during tracheotomy. TBI resulting from tracheal intubation (insertion of a tube into the trachea) is rare, and the mechanism by which it occurs is unclear. However, one likely mechanism involves an endotracheal tube catching in a fold of membrane and tearing it as it is advanced downward through the airway. When an endotracheal tube tears the trachea, it typically does so at the posterior (back) membranous wall. Unlike TBI that results from blunt trauma, most iatrogenic injuries to the airway involve longitudinal tears {{to the back of}} the trachea or tears on the side that pull the membranous part of the trachea away from the cartilage. Excessive pressure from the cuff of an endotracheal tube can reduce blood supply to the tissues of the trachea, leading to ischemia and potentially causing it to become ulcerated, infected, and, later, narrowed.|$|E
5|$|Chest x-ray is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical emphysema, air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and subcutaneous emphysema. If subcutaneous emphysema occurs and the hyoid bone appears in an X-ray to be sitting unusually high in the throat, {{it may be an}} indication that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an endotracheal tube appears in an X-ray to be out of place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn all the way around, the lung may collapse outward toward the chest wall (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds it toward the center. In a person lying face-up, the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is pathognomonic of TBI (that is, it is diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on chest X-ray. CT scanning detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for <b>bronchoscopy.</b>|$|E
40|$|Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) {{pneumonia}} {{is associated}} with very high mortality. Though surgical evacuation of necrotic tissue is desirable in patients unresponsive to antimicrobial therapy, most patients are acutely ill precluding surgical intervention. We utilized a combination of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with frequent toilet <b>bronchoscopies</b> to salvage an unaffected right lung from spillage of necrotic pus from left lung cavitary CA-MRSA pneumonia in a 22 -year-old patient. Our patient while on ECMO and after decannulation was positioned with the right lung up at all times with 1 - 2 toilet <b>bronchoscopies</b> every day for almost 30 days. This time was utilized for ventilator weaning and optimizing the nutritional status prior to extrapleural left pneumonectomy. Prevention of soilage of the unaffected right lung and mitigating volutrauma with ECMO support combined with the subsequent surgical evacuation of necrotic left lung tissue led to a favorable outcome in this case. This strategy could be of value in similar presentations of unilateral suppurative pneumonia, where the progressive disease occurs despite optimal medical therapy...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Nocturnal airway {{narrowing}} is {{a common}} problem for patients with asthma but the role of inflammation in its pathogenesis is unclear. Overnight changes in airway inflammatory cell populations were studied in patients with nocturnal asthma and in control normal subjects. METHODS [...] <b>Bronchoscopies</b> were performed at 0400 hours and 1600 hours in eight healthy subjects and in 10 patients with nocturnal asthma (> 15 % overnight fall in peak flow plus at least one awakening/week with asthma). The two <b>bronchoscopies</b> were separated by at least five days, and both the order of <b>bronchoscopies</b> and site of bronchoalveolar lavage (middle lobe or lingula with contralateral lower lobe bronchial biopsy) were randomised. RESULTS [...] In the normal subjects {{there was no difference}} in cell numbers and differential cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid between 0400 and 1600 hours, but in the nocturnal asthmatic subjects both eosinophil counts (median 0. 11 x 10 (5) cells/ml at 0400 hours, 0. 05 x 10 (5) cells/ml at 1600 hours) and lymphocyte numbers (0. 06 x 10 (5) cells/ml at 0400 hours, 0. 03 x 10 (5) cells/ml at 1600 hours) increased at 0400 hours, along with an increase in eosinophil cationic protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (3. 0 micrograms/ml at 0400 hours, 2. 0 micrograms/l at 1600 hours). There were no changes in cell populations in the bronchial biopsies or in alveolar macrophage production of hydrogen peroxide, GM-CSF, or TNF alpha in either normal or asthmatic subjects at 0400 and 1600 hours. There was no correlation between changes in overnight airway function and changes in cell populations in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. CONCLUSIONS [...] This study confirms that there are increases in inflammatory cell populations in the airway fluid at night in asthmatic but not in normal subjects. The results have also shown a nocturnal increase in eosinophil cationic protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, but these findings do not prove that these inflammatory changes cause nocturnal airway narrowing...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Non {{invasive}} {{respiratory support}} {{has been used in}} a wide variety of settings. This case report illustrates the benefit of such support in a complex multi-trauma patient. Case presentation: A 42 year-old male restrained driver was brought to the trauma bay with multiple injuries. These included: aortic transection, frontal lobe hemorrhages, bilateral pneumothoraces, multiple rib fractures, diaphragmatic rupture, C 7 fracture, and pubic rami fractures. After surgical repair, the patient was transferred to the Kessler Burn Trauma ICU sedated and ventilated. Serial <b>bronchoscopies</b> were performed to improve aeration of his left lung over the next week. The patient was extubated on POD # 9 but required reintubation the following day due to lung collapse. A regimen of non invasive positive pressure ventilation was initiated to avoid reintubation for repeated <b>bronchoscopies.</b> The therapy was successful and the patient progressed to room air after one week. Conclusion: Studies have strongly supported the use non invasive respiratory support for reducing morbidity and mortality of specific groups of patients in acute respiratory failure. In this case report it was used successfully in an acute multi-trauma patient. Non invasive respiratory support should be considered for the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory failure in even the most complex patients...|$|R
