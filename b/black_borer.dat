40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2010. Includes bibliographical references. The {{potential}} {{damage caused by}} the invasion of exotic ambrosia beetles to Hawaiʻi {{is one of the}} biggest concerns for the coffee, forestry and ornamental plant industries. Most of these invasive beetles are from temperate areas and find a suitable environment for reproduction and survival in Hawaii, which is favored by climatic conditions, presence of alternate hosts and the lack of natural enemies. The <b>black</b> twig <b>borer,</b> Xylosandrus compactus (Eichhoff), is an important coffee pest and native forests in Hawaiʻi. This ambrosia beetle is highly polyphagous, reported from > 200 hosts, including native plants such as the valuable timber species Acacia koa. This dissertation addressed the response of X. compactus to semiochemicals which were used to determine the beetle flight seasonality, phenology of the <b>black</b> twig <b>borer</b> in coffee plantations, and development of a sequential sampling plan for management decision making. It was demonstrated that Japanese beetle traps baited with ethanol can serve as monitoring tool for the <b>black</b> twig <b>borer,</b> and ethyl alcohol baits yielded higher capture rates than eugenol and α-pinene. It was also demonstrated that the repellents verbenone and limonene, significantly reduced trap catches of <b>black</b> twig <b>borer.</b> Ethanol baited Japanese beetle tras were used to assess the seasonal fluctuation of <b>black</b> twig <b>borer</b> throughout the year. Data obtained from trapping demonstrated the peak beetle flight periods, which were used as an predictor of damage levels for accurate timing of control measures. Elevation and season were significantly related with the number of beetles captured and level of infestation. Taylor's Power Law analysis showed an aggregated infestation of X. compactus in coffee fields. The density of infested branches per sampled unit can be estimated using the sampling plan and compared with the action threshold level to make a management decision. Enumerative sampling allows estimation of the <b>black</b> twig <b>borer</b> abundance with specified precision, providing researchers with a valid tool for the study of this pest in coffee. Three species of scolytines were detected attacking coffee berries in Hawaiʻi, Xylosandrus compactus, Hypothenemus obscurus and H. hampei. The biology, behavior and management of these three species are discussed...|$|R
50|$|These trees {{can reach}} 11 m tall. Their leaves are each {{made up of}} oval-shaped, asymmetrical, net-veined {{leaflets}}. Variety auwahiensis has leaflets with rusty-red undersides. The fruits contain a seed with a bright red aril. The arils are sweet-tasting and were food for native Hawaiians. The seeds also attract rats, whose consumption of them prevents the plants of this endangered species from reproducing.

40|$|Field corn, genetically {{engineered}} {{to produce a}} protein derived from Bacillus thuringiensis, was evaluated for its effects on larvae of <b>black</b> cutworm, stalk <b>borer,</b> armyworm, and corn earworm. No Btcorn effects were observed on larval survival, pupal weight, or days to adult emergence for black cutworm or stalk borer. Armyworms reared on Bt leaf extract were lighter-weight, delayed in development, and showed diminished survival rates. Corn earworm showed reduced survival and delays in development. In field tests of Bt and non-Bt corn, {{there were no differences}} between the two varieties in damage from <b>black</b> cutworm. Stalk <b>borer</b> caused less leaf damage to Bt corn.

50|$|Although it had {{declined}} {{along with other}} dry and mesic forest plants, many large trees could still be found until the 1970s. At that point, {{the arrival of the}} <b>black</b> twig <b>borer,</b> (Xylosandrus compactus) caused a catastrophic collapse of the species. Today, populations only exist in the northwestern part of Kauai, the Waianae Range on Oahu, the southwestern slopes of Haleakalā on Maui, and the Big Island's Kona coast. Nearly all living individuals exist as basal shoots from older trees where the main trunk has died, or are outplanted saplings. Because of the extreme durability of the wood and its easily recognized fluted pattern, many dead trunks can still be found.|$|R

40|$|Curculionidae Scolytinae), {{a species}} {{recently}} recorded into Italy. Intense trade flows favour the accidental diffusion of alien {{plant and animal}} species harmful to agricultural crops and forest ecosystems {{in many parts of the}} world. Particularly prone to such introductions are lignicolous species of wood-boring beetles that attack living plants and can develop in lumber or crating wood, such as many species belonging to the subfamilies Scolytinae and Platypodinae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Investigations of marked witherings of laurel twigs (Laurus nobilis L.) carried out from autumn 2010 in an area of the Versilia coast (Lucca) revealed that the <b>Black</b> twig <b>borer,</b> Xylosandrus compactus (Eichhoff), was involved in this pathological expression. This species was recently recorded for the first time in Italy on ornamental plants in some localities in the Naples’s province. Here we report its essential external morphological features, with useful characters for its distinction from X. germanus (Blandford), a morphologically similar species, as well as its essential bioecological features, with special reference to what has been observed in the above-mentioned area of Tuscany. This should facilitate the rapid identification and verification of new outbreaks and, where possible, the timely implementation of control strategies...|$|R

50|$|The {{plant is}} very rare today, with fewer than 100 {{individuals}} remaining in the wild, with some estimates at fewer than 50 plants. It does not reproduce very successfully, having {{a low level of}} recruitment. The plant's habitat has been degraded or destroyed by development, agriculture, and fire, and invaded by exotic species of plants and animals. The invasive fountaingrass (Pennisetum setaceum) is particularly harmful to the habitat, covering whole fields and increasing the danger of fire. The seeds are eaten by rats, and cattle and goats graze in the area. An insect, the <b>black</b> coffee twig <b>borer</b> (Xylosandrus compactus), damages the seedlings and saplings. Since the wood is so highly sought after, the trees are still in danger of being harvested. The population on the Big Island grows on the side of Hualālai, a dormant volcano, and so is technically in danger of being extirpated {{in the event of an}} eruption.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Black</b> Coffee Twig <b>Borer,</b> Xyalosandrus compactus (Eichhoff) {{is a new}} but rapidly {{spreading}} pest {{of coffee}} and other plant species. However, knowledge of its pest status, damage and host plant species utilization in Uganda is still limited. To ascertain its spread and impact, a survey was conducted on 250 farms in 25 districts in the 5 major coffee growing regions of Uganda. At farm level, 12 coffee trees were randomly sampled along a diagonal transect and assessed for X. compactus infestation. In addition, host plant utilization by the pest was determined through farmers’ interviews and direct search by researchers. Our data show that the pest is present in all the 5 districts (100 %) sampled in central region viz:- Mukono, Luwero, Mityana, Mubende and Mpigi, and at least 50 % of the districts in southwestern viz:- Bundibugyo, Kasese and Rubirizi. However, the beetle was not observed in northwestern (West Nile), northern and part of eastern (Mt. Elgon) regions. X. compactus prevalence (percentage of infested farms), incidence (percentage of infested trees) and damage (percentage of infested primary branches) were 58. 1, 34. 0 and 3. 8 % respectively in the central region whereas, 22. 1, 7. 7 and 0. 8 % respectively in the southwestern region. At district level, the highest prevalence (100 %) was observed in Mukono and Luwero then Bundibugyo (62. 5 %), Mityana (50. 0 %), Rubirizi (40 %) and Kasese (30 %). Similarly, high incidence rates of 91. 7, 73. 3 and 44. 8 % were observed in Mukono, Luwero and Bundibugyo respectively. Likewise, high damage rates of 13. 6, 5. 2 and 4. 8 % were observed in Mukono, Luwero and Bundibugyo districts respectively. Further, our study identified and documented more than 30 plant species in 17 families as potential hosts for X. compactus. These include important commercial and food crops, forest, fruit and shade trees and shrubs. In conclusion, this study confirms earlier surveys and reports that the <b>black</b> coffee twig <b>borer</b> is fast and rapidly spreading away from its initial occurrence (southwestern Uganda) and epicenter (central Uganda) to new infestation areas, posing a big threat to coffee production in the country. Therefore, there is an urgent need {{to put in place}} comprehensive mitigation measures in order to prevent the pest from spreading to new areas and also to minimize its impact on coffee production within the already affected areas.

40|$|<b>Black</b> coffee twig <b>borer</b> {{is a new}} but rapidly {{spreading}} {{insect pest}} of coffee in Uganda. Female beetles bore into primary branches/twigs and cultivate an ambrosia fungus for feeding their larvae. Thus, controlling the fungus means depriving the brood a source of food. Three fungicides, chlorothalonil (Glider), tebuconazole (Orius 25 EW) and dimethomorph + mancozeb (Volar) were evaluated in vitro for their effectiveness in inhibiting mycelial growth of ambrosia fungus associated with the beetle. The pathogen was exposed to four concentrations (1. 5 x, 1. 25 x, 1. 0 x and 0. 5 x times the manufacturer recommended rate) incorporated into potato dextrose agar using inhibition and food poisoning techniques. The three fungicides inhibited fungal growth to some extent, even at the lowest concentration (0. 5 x) and percentage inhibition was significantly different (P≤ 0. 05) from each other. Tebucozanole caused 100 % growth inhibition irrespective of concentration and technique used while chlorothalonil and dimethomorph + mancozeb caused less than 40 % inhibition for both techniques. Therefore, research should determine effectiveness of tebucozanole for suppressing fungal growth under field conditions for diminishing beetle incidence and fungal pathogenic effects in infested branches. This will pave way for integration of use of tebucozanole into overall Integrated Pest Management package (IPM) for the beetle in Uganda. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the species}} of banana <b>borers,</b> <b>black</b> weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus) {{is the most}} {{economically}} important pest in Costa Rica and worldwide. The control of C. sordidus in intensive production systems is mainly based on application of insecticides; therefore the search for biological alternatives, {{such as the use}} of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN), is needed. The susceptibility of Cosmopolites sordidus to Heterorhabditis atacamensis CIANE 07 was evaluated. The effect of inoculating H. atacamensis on larvae and adults of C. sordidus, in vitro and in artificially infected corms, was evaluated. Larvae inoculated with EPN had a mortality of 88 % on the second day and 100 % on the third day; no mortality was observed in adults. The treatments of 100, 500 and 1000 IJ. larvae- 1 showed statistically significant differences from the control and theLD 50 was 52 IJ. larvae- 1. When the larvae were placed within the corms the LD 50 increased to 375 IJ. larvae- 1. The results indicate that the strain H. atacamensis CIA-NE 07 is capable of locating and infecting weevil larvae within the banana corm and reach infection levels over 80 %, 10 days after inoculation at doses of 1000 and 2000 IJ. larvae- 1.

40|$|The <b>Black</b> Coffee Twig <b>Borer</b> (BCTB), (Xylosandrus compactus (Eichhoff)) is {{a devastating}} pest on robusta coffee in Uganda. The coffee in Uganda grows mostly in {{agroforestry}} systems where trees and crops are combined {{and interact with}} each other. Farmers believe they have to cut down other trees {{in order to reduce}} the problem of the BCTB, because they think the trees increase the risk of receiving the pest on their farm. This is against the vision of Vi Agroforestry, who plant and preserve trees in order to increase stability within the farming systems. This study investigated if abundance of the BCTB increases with increased amount of shade on robusta coffee. Another aim of the study was to investigate if the knowledge level and opinion about BCTB and shade for coffee, vary between farmers, officers and researchers. The study was mostly conducted in Kalungu and in Bukomansimbi districts in the central region of Uganda. This included the observational field study as well as interviews with the farmers and officers working in these districts. Other interviews with researchers and officers working with the whole country were conducted in the surroundings of the capital, Kampala. We measured amount of shade in relation to degree of infestation by the BCTB by counting their entrance/exit holes on coffee trees in each farmer’s coffee plantation. The opinions and knowledge between the three groups of people (farmers, officers and researchers) differed in some questions. One question that resulted in various answers, especially among the officers and researchers, was if shaded or sun-exposed coffee is most affected by the BCTB. Most of the farmers said it is the shaded coffee that is most affected by the BCTB. Our observational study showed a significant (P< 0. 05) increase of infestation by the BCTB between two categories of shade, from 0 - 20...|$|R
