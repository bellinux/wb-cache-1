5|$|At a {{literary}} salon in January 1909, Pound met the novelist Olivia Shakespear {{and her daughter}} Dorothy, who became his wife in 1914. Through Olivia Shakespear he was introduced to her former lover W. B. Yeats, in Pound's view the greatest living poet. Pound had sent Yeats a copy of A Lume Spento the previous year, <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> Venice, and Yeats had apparently found it charming. The men became close friends, although Yeats was older by 20 years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> Cranfield Braham was {{involved}} in another car accident which removed him from duty. He was injured when the Austin 7 {{in which he was}} travelling left the road at speed. He had been on a night out celebrating his success. The five passengers (three officers and two girls) were all wounded, but one of the women later died in hospital. Once recovered Bob survived two scares on duty at Cranfield. On 13 March a Beaufighter's engines cut out forcing him to make an emergency landing, and on the same day, his second flight ended with the aircraft's engines catching fire. Braham managed to conduct a safe landing.|$|E
5|$|For three seasons, City {{finished}} in mid-table in Division Three {{and the new}} Division Two, when the leagues were renamed following {{the formation of the}} Premier League. In January 1994, Geoffrey Richmond took over as chairman. He cleared the debts, loaned the club £2.3million, and promised the fans he would take the club to the Premier League within five years. In his first season as chairman, the club {{finished in}} seventh place with Frank Stapleton as manager. Stapleton was sacked and was replaced by Lennie Lawrence. Lawrence could only finish 14th in his first season, <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> Luton Town in November 1995 to be replaced by his assistant Chris Kamara.|$|E

5|$|In 1570, El Greco {{moved to}} Rome, where he {{executed}} {{a series of}} works strongly marked by his Venetian apprenticeship. It is unknown how long he remained in Rome, though he may have returned to Venice (c. 1575–76) <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> Spain. In Rome, {{on the recommendation of}} Giulio Clovio, El Greco was received as a guest at the Palazzo Farnese, which Cardinal Alessandro Farnese had made a center of the artistic and intellectual life of the city. There he came into contact with the intellectual elite of the city, including the Roman scholar Fulvio Orsini, whose collection would later include seven paintings by the artist (View of Mt. Sinai and a portrait of Clovio are among them).|$|E
5|$|Like Maradona, Ronaldo only {{stayed a}} short time <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> Internazionale. However, new heroes emerged, such as Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Luis Enrique and Rivaldo, and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its centenari, winning the Primera División title, and Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this {{domestic}} success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and Núñez resigning in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Between 1895 and 1914, {{he lived}} in Switzerland (except for one year in Prague, 1911–12), where he {{received}} his academic diploma from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in 1900. He later taught there at the same institute {{as a professor of}} theoretical physics between 1912 and 1914 <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> Berlin. In 1901, after being stateless for more than five years, Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1905, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich. The same year, his annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.|$|E

5|$|However, a major rift {{of opinion}} {{existed between the}} Japanese {{government}} and its two field armies, the SEA and 10th Army, which as of November were both nominally {{under the control of}} the Central China Area Army led by SEA commander Matsui. Matsui made clear to his superiors even <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> Shanghai that he wanted to march on Nanking. He was convinced that the conquest of the Chinese capital city of Nanking would provoke the fall of the entire Nationalist Government of China and thus hand Japan a quick and complete victory in its war on China. Yanagawa was likewise eager to conquer Nanking and both men chafed under the operation restriction line that had been imposed on them by the Army General Staff.|$|E
5|$|Orr {{was born}} in the town of Parry Sound on the shores of Georgian Bay in Ontario, Canada. His grandfather, Robert Orr, was a top-tier soccer pro player who emigrated from Ballymena, Northern Ireland to Parry Sound early in the 20th century. Orr's father, Doug Orr, had once been a hockey {{prospect}} and was invited to join the Atlantic City Seagulls in 1942 but turned down the offer. Doug Orr instead joined the Royal Canadian Navy, serving during the Second World War. He returned after the war to Parry Sound and Arva Steele, whom he had married <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> war, and to a job in the CIL dynamite factory. Doug and Arva had five children together: Patricia, Ronnie, Bobby, Penny and Doug Jr. Bobby was born on March 20, 1948 at St. Joseph's Hospital, where his grandmother Elsie Orr was a nurse. Bobby was a sick baby at birth and his survival was tenuous.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{arrived in}} New York on 20 October 1953 to {{undertake}} another tour of poetry-reading and talks, organised by Brinnin. Although he complained of chest trouble and gout {{while still in}} Britain, {{there is no record}} that he received medical treatment for either condition. He was in a melancholy mood about the trip and his health was poor; he relied on an inhaler to aid his breathing and there were reports that he was suffering from blackouts. His visit to say goodbye to BBC producer Philip Burton, a few days <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> New York, was interrupted by a blackout. On his last night in London he had another in the company of his fellow poet Louis MacNeice. The next day he visited a doctor for a smallpox-vaccination certificate.|$|E

5|$|The {{screenplay}} for The Brute Man {{was written by}} George Bricker and M. Coates Webster based on a story by Dwight V. Babcock. An author of pulp fiction stories and novels, Babock started writing for Universal Pictures in 1943, where he worked primarily on horror films. The Brute Man marked the last of nine films Babcock wrote for Universal <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> a job at Columbia Pictures. Bricker wrote several screenplays {{in a variety of}} genres, from horror films and mysteries to comedies, and worked primarily as a freelancer jumping from studio to studio. Babcock and Brister previously worked together on several low-budget horror films, including The Devil Bat (1940), House of Dracula (1945), Pillow of Death (1945), She-Wolf of London (1946) and House of Horrors (1946).

25|$|Cook's {{journals}} {{were published}} upon his return, {{and he became}} something of a hero among the scientific community.

Cook's son George was born five days <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> his second voyage.|$|E

Sabu took the victory {{in each of these}} matches, usually gaining the pinfall over Diamond after Saturn left the match to defend his companion. His final appearance for the WWA came in their last PPV, The Reckoning, in New Zealand. During this tour he first fought Shane Douglas but due to injury he did not face him at the PPV. Instead Douglas came to the ring and eventually allowed Joe E Legend to face Sabu instead. Sabu won this match, his second and last WWA match ever.
