Research of cast data matrix symbols has been limited and expected symbol performance unknown. To develop knowledge of cast data matrix symbol performance, the investigation initially focused on feasibility of casting data matrix symbol. Results of a feasibility experiment led to further investigation of cast symbol design expected performance. Bump marks were evaluated initially due to the inherent ease of production and use in previous cast data matrix applications. The results indicate <b>Bump</b> <b>mark</b> geometry is problematic, due to the inherent nature of shadow formation {{as a means to}} create contrast marks. Using design inspiration from Dot Peen data matrix symbols, an alternative cast data matrix design was pursued and analyzed. The results of this modified Dimple mark geometry proved to be superior to the Bump contrast symbol geometry in side by side analysis. A deeper analysis at the module level was also pursued to determine the effect on Print Growth and Symbol Contrast for an array of mark diameters, spacing and surface roughness values. Also, an optimal light angle was selected based on the ANOVA analysis and Print Growthm and Symbol Contrast averages. An applicable design was presented {{with the use of a}} heuristic to select ideal symbol factors, which indicated the physical size for aluminum cast data matrix symbols with ten and 50 character capacities were determined to be 1. 75 and 3. 00 inches, respectively. Using the same methodology for ferrous cast data matrix symbols with ten and 50 character capacities, the physical symbol size was determined to be 2. 19 and 3. 75 inches, respectively...|$|E
25|$|As {{a way of}} {{visualizing}} {{the choice}} of a gauge, consider whether it is possible to tell if a cylinder has been twisted. If the cylinder has no <b>bumps,</b> <b>marks,</b> or scratches on it, we cannot tell. We could, however, draw an arbitrary curve along the cylinder, defined by some function θ(x), where x measures distance along the axis of the cylinder. Once this arbitrary choice (the choice of gauge) has been made, it becomes possible to detect it if someone later twists the cylinder.|$|R

He could not help but admit that she had tricked him neatly, and that it must have taken nerve to do the thing she did and to set out armed only with a pistol through the trackless waste that lay between them and the railway and beyond into the hills where Wilhelmstal lies.|$|R

50|$|Pennaceous {{feathers}} on the forelimb or wing {{are often}} attached strongly due to stresses related to flight or other activities. This strong attachment {{is accomplished by}} ligaments under the skin, which in some birds and feathered dinosaurs results in raised <b>bumps</b> or <b>marks</b> along the rear forelimb bone (ulna). These bumps, called quill knobs (ulnar papillae), are often used as an indirect indication of strongly-attached forelimb feathers in fossil species, and can also indirectly indicate the number of secondary remiges in a given specimen.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a method for}} measuring the number and durations of processing stages from the electroencephalographic signal {{and apply it to}} the study of associative recognition. Using an extension of past research that combines multivariate pattern analysis with hidden semi-Markov models, the approach identifies on a trial-by-trial basis where brief sinusoidal peaks (called bumps) are added to the ongoing electroencephalographic signal. We propose that these <b>bumps</b> <b>mark</b> the onset of critical cognitive stages in processing. The results of the analysis can be used to guide the development of detailed process models. Applied to the associative recognition task, the hidden semi-Markov models multivariate pattern analysis method indicates that the effects of associative strength and probe type are localized to a memory retrieval stage and a decision stage. This is in line with a previously developed the adaptive control of thought-rational process model, called ACT-R, of the task. As a test of the generalization of our method we also apply it to a data set on the Sternberg working memory task collected by Jacobs, Hwang, Curran, and Kahana (2006). The analysis generalizes robustly, and localizes the typical set size effect in a late comparison/decision stage. In addition to providing information about the number and durations of stages in associative recognition, our analysis sheds light on the event-related potential components implicated in the study of recognition memory.

50|$|The {{presiding}} {{judge was}} Hiller B. Zobel. The prosecution, led by Assistant District Attorney Gerald Leone, along with Assistant District Attorney Martha Coakly, presented eight physicians involved in Matthew's care, including a neurosurgeon, an ophthalmologist, a radiologist, two pathologists {{and an expert}} in child abuse, who testified to their belief that his injuries had occurred {{as a result of}} violent shaking and from his head impacting with a hard surface. The defense challenged this, among other things, on the grounds that there were no neck injuries to him - injuries that they claimed would have been expected if he had been violently shaken. The prosecution had also claimed initially that his impact injuries were the equivalent of having been thrown from a two-story building, but they equivocated over this claim as the trial progressed. The defense presented expert medical testimony that his injury may have occurred three weeks before the date of death, implying that his parents, Sunil and Deborah Eappen, both of whom were doctors, might be implicated in negligence or abuse of the child. There were old wrist injuries to him that may have been incurred before Woodward even arrived at the house. She, however, claimed under cross-examination that she never noticed any slight <b>bumps,</b> <b>marks</b> or any unusual behavior by him at any time prior to the night he was taken to the hospital.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the course}} of their college lives, Aica {{graduated}} as a Mathematics Major in Ateneo and Zoe graduated as a Neuro Science Major in Princeton both Suma Cum Laudes. Before returning to the Philippines, Zoe undergoes Plastic Surgery and becomes insanely beautiful losing all her weight, so does Aica, who now looks attractive. Both are now models and when both of them learns each other's success, it angers them both leading to Zoe <b>bumping</b> on <b>Mark,</b> now a literate and American graduate. Angering Zoe, she plots another revenge on Aica and shows everybody the animated video version of Aica defecating to the reunion that took place a few days later. Aica follows Zoe to her house and as she enters, a booby trap almost kills Aica [...] After several minutes of Zoe trying to kill Aica, Zoe finally gives up after Aica almost drowns her. The two made up when suddenly, Zoe reveals it was just an act and points a gun at Aica. Aica runs for her life only to <b>bump</b> into <b>Mark,</b> who shielded Aica from the blow, wounding his face. Mark is admitted to the hospital while Aica asks Zoey to apologise. She initially does not feel guilty but is given a picture of wounded Mark and she realises her mistake. Aica and Mark get married the day that Zoe plans to leave in an aircraft. She sets a booby trap in their hotel which leads to a childhood picture of the girls. Zoey apologises in a note and boards the aircraft.|$|R

40|$|The {{accretion}} disk {{is an attractive}} model for BL Lac objects because of its preferred axis and high efficiency. While the smooth continuum spectra of BL Lacs do not show large UV <b>bumps,</b> in <b>marked</b> contrast to quasars, high quality simultaneous data do reveal deviations from smoothness. Using detailed calculations of cool {{accretion disk}} spectra, the best measured ultraviolet and soft x ray spectra of the BL Lac object PKS 2155 - 304 are fitted. The mass and accretion rate required are determined. A hot disk or corona could comptonize soft photons from the cool disk and produce the observed power law spectrum in the 1 to 10 keV range. The dynamic time scales in the disk regions that contribute most of the observed ultraviolet and soft x ray photons {{are consistent with the}} respective time scales for intensity variations. The mass derived from fitting the continuum spectrum is consistent with the limit derived from the fastest hard x ray variability...|$|R

Driving the new Honda HRX Indy V-8s, Bobby Rahal and Mike Groff were the two slowest cars in the field, and risked being bumped. If Rahal were to be <b>bumped,</b> it would <b>mark</b> {{the second year in}} a row. Through a sponsorship connection, Roger Penske offered Rahal and Groff the use of two 1993 PC-22/Ilmor V-8 machines (2.65L). Rahal received an Ilmor D engine, while Groff received an Ilmor C+ engine. They were not the Mercedes-Benz 209I power plants, however they were competitive enough to comfortably make the field if needed. Paul Tracy shook down the cars before handing them over to the Rahal team.|$|R

Also, it was a great opportunity to experience the music industry from the inside. Unfortunately, I discovered all too quickly why the other band members had left and cut off contact with Martin and, to a lesser extent, Mark. As Martin was very ill -something I knew absolutely nothing about until the day he turned up at the airport when we flew to LA - after we did the US TV shows, I didn't hear anything from either of them again although I was kept on the payroll for another four months. I was unceremoniously dumped when I was no longer useful. I understand that business is ruthless but {{we were supposed to be}} mates. They'd known me since the age of 14.

50|$|Reminiscence is the remembering {{again of}} the {{forgotten}} without re-learning, a gradual process of improvement in the capacity to revive past experiences. Simply put, it is the act of remembering information on a later test {{that could not be}} remembered on an earlier test. Ballard coined the term reminiscence in 1913 when he conducted a study asking young school children to memorize poetry. He found that over successive recalls, the children would often recall new lines of poetry that they failed to recall previously. The concept of reminiscence can be applied in treatment settings for patients with memory impairment. Reminiscence therapy involves the discussion of past activities and experiences with another person, utilizing tangible aids such as photographs to cue recall. This is normally used to assist dementia patients suffering from extreme memory loss. Reminiscence is also associated with one's own autobiographical memory, which is not evenly distributed through the lifespan. When left to recall their own self-memories, people over the age of forty experience a reminiscence <b>bump,</b> having a <b>marked</b> increase of memories from the period between ages fifteen and thirty. Reminiscence is required for the phenomenon of hypermnesia (an overall improvement in performance across tests) but hypermnesia is not required for reminiscence.|$|R
40|$|Esta tese toma por objeto a teleficção brasileira, mais especificamente as minisséries produzidas pela Rede Globo de Televisão entre 1982 e 1992. A análise aborda aspectos centrais para a produção desses programas: as determinantes sociais e políticas mais gerais, os sentidos atribuídos pelos produtores, as lógicas de distribuição das principais propriedades sociais, os mecanismos de recrutamento, os princípios de hierarquização vigentes na indústria televisiva, as convenções e os conteúdos ideológicos dos produtos. Sob a conjuntura de efervescência social e política que marca esse período, o conglomerado mais dinâmico da indústria {{cultural}} no Brasil iniciou a diversificação dos seus formatos teleficcionais, visando predominantemente a obtenção de rendimentos simbólicos. Oferecendo ao público ampliado programas sofisticados, a Rede Globo angaria para si uma respeitabilidade pública que lhe permite neutralizar um amplo arco de acusações, mas, sobretudo, a plataforma pela democratização dos meios de comunicação defendida por movimentos sociais e partidos de esquerda. Do ponto de vista interno, todavia, as minisséries são muito valorizadas. Idealizada como via de aprimoramento das telenovelas, essa produção também abre margem para experimentação no próprio âmbito da arte comercial, razão pela qual se prestam melhor às pretensões autorais de roteiristas e diretores propensos a expressar suas perspectivas pessoais sobre o mundo e a teleficção, expondo de modo mais explícito o viés pedagógico subjacente às tramas, aos diálogos e à visão de mundo típica da indústria cultural brasileira. A análise detida de uma amostra de minisséries que abrange as principais linhas temáticas exploradas pela Rede Globo naquele interregno cuida de discernir as tomadas de posição mediante às quais o aparelho ideológico estabelece significações e hierarquiza valores acerca de questões fulcrais na experiência social brasileira, mas também as estratégias acionadas pelos produtores nos limites da margem de que dispõem para incutir nos programas traços pessoais que reforçam, atenuam ou mesmo contrariam o sentido geral imperante. O conteúdo das minisséries delineia um gradiente que parte da abordagem explícita de tópicos interditados seja por racionalidade política, seja pela lógica comercial, até o apelo em graus mais ou menos atenuados a estratégias alusivas. Não por acaso, os assuntos que põem em funcionamento as estruturas de contenção da indústria cultural repercutem os solavancos a pontuar a modernização em marcha forçada da sociedade brasileira: a desagregação do patriarcado, o preconceito racial, o autoritarismo político e, permeando todos eles, o papel despenhado pela própria mídia em diversos registros. This dissertation {{studies the}} Brazilian television drama, more specifically the serials produced by Globo Network Television between 1982 and 1992. The analyses approaches {{features that are}} central to the production of these programs: broader social and political determinants, the meanings attributed by the producers, the logics of distribution of the main social properties, the mechanisms of hiring, the hierarchizing principles that are valid in the television industry, the conventions and the ideological content of the products. Under the conjuncture of social and political changes that marks this period, the most dynamic conglomerate of Brazilian cultural industry initiated the diversification of its drama formats, aiming mainly to gain symbolical profit. By offering sophisticated programs to the amplified public, Globo Network Television attracts to itself a public respectability that allows it to neutralize a broad spectrum of accusations, especially the platform of democratizing media communication system defended by social movements and left wing parties. From an internal point of view, though, the serials are too much valorized. Idealized as a way of improving the telenovelas, the production of serials also opens space for experimentation in the commercialś art own dominion, reason why they are better suited to the authorial pretensions of the writers and directors that are willing to express their personal perspectives about the world and the television drama, explicitly exposing the pedagogical bias of underlying the plots, the dialogues and the world view typically of the Brazilian cultural industry. An attentive analyses of a serial sample that encompasses the main thematic lines explored by Globo Network Television at the period allows specifying the positions by which the ideological apparatus establishes meanings and hierarchizes values regarding fundamental issues of the Brazilian social experience, and also visualizing the strategies used by the producers within the limits of the boundaries that they have to put inside the programs personal features that reinforces, attenuate or even contradict the general ruling direction. The serial contend outlines a gradient that goes from direct approach of topics that are interdicted by either the political rationality and the commercial logic, to invocation in more or less attenuated degrees of the allusion strategies. Not accidentally, topics that make the contention structures of the cultural industry reverberate the <b>bumps</b> that <b>mark</b> the ongoing forced modernization of the Brazilian society: the decadence of the patriarchate, the racial prejudice, the political authoritarianism and, permeating them all, the role played by the media itself in a couple of registries...|$|R
