Eli Lilly, grandson {{of the company}} founder, introduced a method for <b>blueprinting</b> manufacturing tickets in 1909. This process, which created multiples copies of a drug formula, helped eliminate manufacturing and transcription errors. In the 1920s Eli introduced the new concept of straight-line production, where raw materials entered {{at one end of}} the facility and the finished product came out the other end, in the company’s manufacturing process. Under Eli’s supervision, the design for Building 22, a new 5-floor plant that opened in Indianapolis in 1926, implemented the straight-line concept to improve production efficiency and lower production costs. One historian noted, [...] "It was probably the most sophisticated production system in the American pharmaceutical industry." [...] This more efficient manufacturing process also allowed the company to hire a regular workforce. Instead of recalling workers at peak times and laying them off when production demand fell, Lilly's regular workforce produced less-costly medicines in off-peak times using the same manufacturing facilities.|$|E
2500|$|Roy's work in Kaon physics {{during his}} {{doctoral}} studies at Stanford University {{was based on}} the applications of algebra in the discipline and his thesis was subsequently published by the university under the title, Current-algebra Applications in Kaon Physics. Later, he worked on scale invariance and deep inelastic scattering while at CERN, Geneva and his research thereafter has covered several aspects of high energy physics. He has developed a new sum rule in two-photon processes which is related to the collision of two real polarized photons and the equation is now known as Roy's Sum Rule. Further, he proposed a solution for U(n)-symmetric Thirring model which has been detailed in two of his articles published in 1975. Later, shifting his focus to supersymmetry and supergravity, he suggested new τ -number violating signals for R-parity breaking and estimated an upper bound on the gaugino-gravitino mass ratio. Deep inelastic lepton-hadron-photon processes with regard to their phenomenological aspects have been another area of his studies. He has also done extensive studies on neutrinos and Higgs mesons which covered the detection of heavy neutrinos, ultralight neutrinos in super-symmetry, oscillations and flavours, and his studies on neutrino detection helped India-based Neutrino Observatory in <b>blueprinting</b> the proposed detector at the observatory.|$|E

40|$|When {{the rate}} at which any given <b>blueprint</b> can be {{replicated}} is subject to decreasing returns, it is optimal to replicate high-quality <b>blueprints</b> more quickly than low-quality <b>blueprints.</b> The cost of introducing high-quality “start-up” <b>blueprints</b> will also rise with {{the rate at}} which they are introduced, and so low-quality <b>blueprints</b> will continue to enter the population. This naturally leads to persistent heterogeneity in <b>blueprint</b> quality. If quality begets quality and firms are identified with collections of <b>blueprints</b> derived from the same initial <b>blueprint,</b> then firms grow at a constant mean rate along the balanced growth path. A firm size distribution with the thick right tail observed in the data can then arise only when the number of <b>blueprints</b> in the economy grows over time. When calibrated to match the firm entry rate and the right tail of the size distribution, a homogeneous quality version of this model implies that the median age among firms with more than 10, 000 employees is about 750 years. If the relative quality of a firm’s <b>blueprints</b> depreciates over time, then firm growth rates are not constant but slow down with age. If the successful replication of new <b>blueprints</b> is rapid but noisy, and high relative quality is sufficiently persistent, this version of the model can explain high observed entry rates, the thick-tailed size distribution, and the relatively young age of large U.

50|$|Because {{few have}} the {{capability}} to actually blueprint, and because of the monetary incentive of claiming one has performed the work, many people have come to believe <b>blueprinting</b> only means that all the specifications are double-checked. Serious efforts at <b>blueprinting</b> result in better-than-factory tolerances, possibly with custom specifications appropriate for the application. Common goals include engine re-manufacturing to achieve the rated power for its manufacturer's design (because not all mass-production engines put out the rated power), and to rebuild the engine to make more power from a given design than otherwise intended (because custom engines can often be redesigned to different specifications). Blueprinted components allow for a more exact balancing of reciprocating parts and rotating assemblies so that less power is lost through excessive engine vibrations and other mechanical inefficiencies.|$|E
