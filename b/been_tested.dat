While niobium dust is an eye and skin irritant {{and a potential}} fire hazard, elemental niobium {{on a larger scale}} is physiologically inert (and thus hypoallergenic) and harmless. It is frequently used in jewelry and has <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> for use in some medical implants.|$|E

5|$|The ease of {{maintaining}} these birds in captivity {{has made them}} popular for studying behavior and physiology. Feeding behavior can be predicted by the optimal foraging theory, where animals minimize time and energy spent to maximize food intake.

5|$|The olive sea snake, Aipysurus laevis, {{has been}} found to have photoreceptors in the skin of its tail, {{allowing}} it to detect light and presumably ensuring it is completely hidden, including its tail, inside coral holes during the day. While other species have not <b>been</b> <b>tested,</b> Aipysurus laevis possibly is not unique among sea snakes in this respect.|$|E
5|$|All eight {{aircraft}} were complete by 1 November and had <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> {{to ensure}} their readiness {{to participate in the}} parade. They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13. It was considered too risky to fly the aircraft from Gorky to Moscow and their wings could not be dismounted which meant that they could not be railed to Moscow either. Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to Moscow, but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Ju 87 A-0, the B-1s were {{returned}} discreetly to the Reich. The {{experience of the}} Spanish Civil War proved invaluable - air and ground crews perfected their skills, and equipment was evaluated under combat conditions. The Ju 87 had not <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> against numerous and well-coordinated fighter opposition; this lesson was learned later at great cost to the Stuka crews.|$|E

5|$|Chemical {{compounds}} {{can bind to}} troponin C to act as troponin activators (calcium sensitizers) or troponin inhibitors (calcium desensitizers). There {{are already}} multiple troponin activators that bind to fast skeletal troponin C, of which tirasemtiv has <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> in multiple clinical trials. In contrast, there are no known compounds that bind with high affinity to cardiac troponin C. The calcium sensitizer, levosimendan, is purported to bind to troponin C, but only weak or inconsistent binding has been detected, precluding any structure determination. In contrast, levosimendan inhibits type 3 phosphodiesterase with nanomolar affinity, so its biological target is controversial.|$|E
5|$|Describing {{the choice}} of {{developing}} a game based on the existing White Wolf property over creating their own, Boyarsky said that although an original property lacked the constraints of an existing one, the downside was {{that it had not}} <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> and could be rejected by its potential audience; an existing property was proven. Troika tried to stay {{as close as possible to}} the White Wolf rules, while reducing the number of abilities and disciplines to those relevant to Bloodlines gameplay.|$|E
5|$|French mycologist Pierre Bulliard {{described}} this species as Boletus felleus in 1788 {{before it was}} transferred into the new genus Tylopilus. It is the type species of Tylopilus, and {{the only member of}} the genus found in Europe. Tylopilus felleus has been the subject of research into bioactive compounds that have <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> for antitumour and antibiotic properties. Although not poisonous, it is generally considered inedible, due to its overwhelming bitterness.In Vietnam it's considered as a delicacy.This species often found in Phu Quoc island.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} what mental element is {{expected}} in cases of trespass to goods; while trespass to the person requires intent, the requirements for trespass to goods have never <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> in court. The common remedy is damages, which may be awarded regardless of if any actual harm is suffered; where there is damage, the defendant will only be liable {{if he could have}} reasonably foreseen it, as in Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co (No 5). Valid defences are those of statutory authority, consent, where it is necessary to interfere with the goods, or jus tertii.|$|E
5|$|Keir Starmer, {{director}} of the CPS, announced on 24 May 2011 that a summons for manslaughter had been issued against Harwood. He said the CPS had reviewed its decision not to prosecute because new medical evidence had emerged during the inquest, and because the various medical accounts, including that of the first pathologist, had <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> during questioning. The trial opened on 18 June 2012. Harwood entered a plea of not guilty, and was acquitted on 19 July.|$|E

The battery management system <b>tested</b> <b>is</b> a Kalman filter which uses measured cell voltage and current measurements to estimate the state of charge online. The system <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> against a Simulink model of a battery to verify its function in different conditions, and later on, the estimator <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> online with a battery pack consisting of 14 Li-ion cells. The cell balancing and state of power estimation <b>was</b> <b>tested.</b> Finally, a general test procedure to evaluate state of charge accuracy <b>was</b> proposed and <b>tested...</b>|$|R
5|$|Many HIV-positive {{people are}} unaware {{that they are}} {{infected}} with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had <b>been</b> <b>tested,</b> and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E
5|$|Niobium-containing {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, {{but some are}} toxic and should be treated with care. The short- and long-term exposure to niobates and niobium chloride, two chemicals that are water-soluble, have <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> in rats. Rats treated with a single injection of niobium pentachloride or niobates show a median lethal dose (LD50) between 10 and 100mg/kg. For oral administration the toxicity is lower; a study with rats yielded a LD50 after seven days of 940mg/kg.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} death, the UK's Health Protection Agency (HPA) said tests had {{established}} that Litvinenko had {{significant amounts of}} the radionuclide polonium-210 (210Po) in his body. British and US government officials said the use of 210Po as a poison had never been documented before, and {{it was probably the}} first time anyone had <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> for the presence of 210Po in their body. The poison was in Litvinenko's cup of tea. Those who had contact with Litvinenko may also have been exposed to radiation.|$|E

5|$|The {{suggested}} subspecies {{were never}} widely used or validated by field biologists; the described morphological differences were small {{enough that they}} could have resulted from simple variation in nonrepresentative samples. Genetic analyses have tested the existence of three of these putative subspecies. A study examining mitochondrial DNA from skin biopsies taken from 13 sampling locations, considered genetic diversity and structure among hippo populations across the continent. The authors found low, but significant, genetic differentiation among H. a. amphibius, H. a. capensis, and H. a. kiboko. Neither H. a. tschadensis nor H. a. constrictus has <b>been</b> <b>tested.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} methods had <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> by the Australians {{in a local}} counter-attack at the Battle of Hamel on 4 July. The German {{defenders of}} Hamel were deeply dug in, and their position commanded a very wide field of fire. Similar positions had resisted capture for two months in the Battle of the Somme. The Australians had used surprise rather than weight at Hamel. The artillery had opened fire only {{at the moment the}} infantry and tanks advanced, and the Germans were rapidly overrun.|$|E
5|$|The three ironclad ships {{selected}} differed {{substantially in}} design and degree of risk. Monitor was the most innovative design {{by virtue of its}} low freeboard, shallow-draft iron hull, and total dependence on steam power. The riskiest element of its design was its rotating gun turret, something that had not previously <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> by any navy. Ericsson's guarantee of delivery in 100 days proved to be decisive in choosing his design despite the risk involved.|$|E
