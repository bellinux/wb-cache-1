40|$|The {{constantly}} increasing market {{requirements of}} high-quality vehicles compel automotive manufacturers to perform lifetime testing {{to verify the}} reliability levels of new products. A common problem is {{that only a small}} number of samples of a system 2 ̆ 7 s component can be tested. In automotive applications, mechanical components subjected to cyclic loading have to be designed against fatigue. In this paper, the Bayesian estimation of lognormal distribution parameters (usually used to define the fatigue lifetime of rubber components) is studied to improve the accuracy of estimation while incorporating the available knowledge on the product. In particular, the finite element results and experts 2 ̆ 7 opinions are considered prior knowledge. For lifetime prediction by Finite Element Method (FEM), a model based on the Brown-Miller law was developed for the rubberlike <b>boot</b> <b>seal</b> material...|$|E
25|$|Dry {{suits are}} better thermal {{protection}} than most wetsuits, and isolate the diver {{from the environment}} more effectively than other exposure suits. When diving in contaminated water, a drysuit with integral <b>boots,</b> <b>sealed</b> dry gloves and a helmet sealed directly to the suit provides the best environmental isolation. The suit material must be selected to be compatible with the expected contaminants. Thermal undersuits can be matched to the expected water temperature.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a Common Criteria protection profile for high assurance security kernels (HASK-PP) {{based on the}} results and experiences of several (international) projects on design and implementation of trustworthy platforms. Our HASK-PP was motivated by the fact that currently no protection profile is available that appropriately covers trusted computing features such as trusted <b>boot,</b> <b>sealing,</b> and trusted channels (secure channels with inherent attestation). In particular, we show how trusted computing features are modeled in the HASK protection profile without depending on any concrete implementation for these features. Instead, this is left to the definition of the security targets of a an IT product which claims conformance to the HASK-PP. Our HASK protection profile was evaluated and certified at evaluation assurance level five (EAL 5) by the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). ...|$|R
40|$|Golder Associates Inc. (Golder) has {{prepared}} this letter presenting {{the results of}} subgrade sampling to characterize the extent of potential soil impacts beneath the liner of the compost area high-flow pond at Recology Hay Road (RHR). The subgrade sampling was carried out {{as described in the}} Subgrade Sampling Plan dated September 16, 2010. 1 In addition, the subgrade below the adjacent low-flow pond was sampled. Background Earlier this year, RHR personnel noted that a gas bubble had formed under the base of the compost area high-flow pond liner. Inspection of the liner revealed holes below the water level along the northeastern side-slope geomembrane liner and several holes that appeared {{to be associated with the}} anchor penetrations for the pond aerators. The <b>boot</b> <b>seals</b> were observed to be torn at locations along the northeastern side slope and along the southern corner side slope. A report on the cause of the gas formation under the compost pond liner was submitted to the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) by letter dated June 4, 2010. The cause of ga...|$|R

5000|$|Sealed {{ball joints}} {{do not require}} {{lubrication}} as they are [...] "lubed for life". Formerly most ball joints had grease fitting (sometimes called a grease zerk) and were designed for periodic addition of a lubricant, however almost all modern cars use sealed ball joints to minimise maintenance requirements. The lubricant was usually a very high-viscosity lubricant. It is commonly believed that standard ball joints will outlive sealed ones because eventually the seal will break, causing the joint to dry out and rust. [...] Additionally, the act of adding new lubricant pushes out old and dry lubricant, extending {{the life of the}} joint. This was supposed to be done at intervals of 1000 to 2000 miles on many vehicles, which is incompatible with the service interval on modern cars, often 12000 miles or more, and in any case was rarely attended to by owners, resulting in severe wear and possible ball joint failure, which can result in serious accidents. For this reason, almost all ball joints on modern European or Far Eastern cars are the sealed for life type. New technology especially applied to the internal bearing design has allowed ball joints to meet these longer service intervals. The special design's incorporate sintered metal bearings which replace OEM sealed polymer/plastic version and improved dust <b>boot</b> <b>seal's</b> that work much better at retaining the grease.|$|R
25|$|Seal skins {{have been}} used by {{aboriginal}} people for millennia to make waterproof jackets and <b>boots,</b> and <b>seal</b> fur to make fur coats. Pelts account for over half the processed value of a seal, selling at over C$100 each as of 2006. According to Paul Christian Rieber, of GC Rieber AS, the difficult ice conditions and low quotas in 2006 resulted in less access to seal pelts, which caused the commodity price to be pushed up. One high-end fashion designer, Donatella Versace, has begun to use seal pelts, while others, such as Calvin Klein, Stella McCartney, Tommy Hilfiger, and Ralph Lauren, refrain from using any kind of fur.|$|R

2500|$|The English word kuspuk {{adapted from}} the Yup'ik word qaspeq (a {{lightweight}} parka cover or overshirt worn by both Yup'ik and Iñupiaq Alaskan Eskimo women and men). Also, the word mukluk (Eskimo boot, a soft knee-high <b>boot</b> of <b>seal</b> or caribou skin) which {{is derived from the}} Yup'ik word maklak meaning bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus). That the word maklak has been borrowed into English as mukluk as the name for Eskimo skin boots (kamguk, kameksak, piluguk, etc., in Yup’ik), probably because bearded-seal skin is used for the soles of skin boots. The village of Kotlik derives its Yup’ik name Qerrulliik (dual form of qerrullik [...] "a pair of pants, trousers"), from its location, where the Yukon River splits apart nearby like the legs on a pair of trousers.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, the Atlantic Coast Hockey League {{was formed}} with Orlando hosting {{one of the}} charter franchises, the Orlando Seals, which won their Commissioner's Cup in 2003; this made Orlando the only Florida city with two hockey championships. The Seals moved to the World Hockey Association 2 in 2003, then the Southern Professional Hockey League in 2004. The City of Orlando revoked their lease for the present Amway Arena, however, forcing them to sit out the 2004-05 season. They moved to Kissimmee and became the Florida Seals in November 2004. The team resumed play in the 2005-2006 season, playing home games at the Silver Spurs Arena, {{making it to the}} President's Cup Finals before losing to Knoxville. Then on January 4, 2007, the Silver Spurs Arena {{abruptly}} <b>booted</b> the <b>Seals</b> due to unpaid rent, forcing the franchise to fold.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{branches}} of the US military use modified, enhanced tests of the regular tests of physical stamina and performance as minimum requirements for applicants to special or elite programs. Some of these programs are SEAL, SWCC, Navy Diver, EOD, and other Special Operations Forces. These tests usually include extra components so that running, swimming, and pullups are all assessed in addition to situps, pushups, and the cardiovascular portion. In some cases pushups techniques and swim strokes may be particular to a certain group, including [...] "diver (triceps) pushups", [...] "combat sidestroke" [...] swim strokes done in full uniform with <b>boots</b> by <b>SEAL</b> and SWCC applicants, and strictly monitored pull-up technique.Within these communities enhanced tests may be given {{in place of the}} regular tests, deriving and reporting the data needed for the minimum requirements of the service and maintaining additional data such as swim and pullup data to meet the requirements of their special program.|$|R
50|$|In the {{few months}} of summer, the people moved camp to the estuaries, because there {{it was easier to}} catch the favoured Arctic char, e.g. by using {{artificial}} weirs, and the eggs of seabirds. For the inland Inuit, the caribou was the most important resource; it provided meat, a hide for clothing, and sinew for rope. The coastal Inuit hunted mostly seals and walruses and, depending on the region, narwhals and belugas; of course also the occasional caribou. The seals were used for food for men and dogs. Their oil was used for the kudliks, and their skin and sinews for <b>seal</b> <b>boots</b> (kamik), kayak coverings, ropes (also drag ropes for dog sleds) and dog whips.|$|R
25|$|Shoes were {{narrow and}} often emphasized. They had a pointed toe and a medium height heel. Buttons, patent leather, and laced {{models of the}} shoe were also {{manufactured}} and readily available. Similarly, there were shoes for every occasion; oxfords for a tailored costume, slippers with straps for festive occasions or pumps with pearl buckles, and finally, boots which were often edged in fur {{to stave off the}} winter chill when riding in a carriage in the winter. At the beginning of 1900s shoes still maintained the same design of the Victorian era. Shoes were commonly made with seal skin or Moroccan leather. Having <b>boots</b> made of <b>seal</b> skin was most common for people in a higher social class. <b>Seal</b> skin <b>boots</b> were known to be extremely durable and could be worn during every season. Boots made from Moroccan leather were more uncomfortable and stiff. World War I caused this opulent era to tone down due to the increased sanctions on the trade of leather and other fabrics, and shoes were starting to incorporate a fabric topping.|$|R
40|$|This study {{registers}} {{a finite}} element analysis of a <b>seal</b> <b>boot</b> used in constant velocity driveshafts, that was performed in the MSC/NASTRAN software for Windows NT 4. 0 in a Personal Computer. By this analysis the structure’s behavior was studied in its work life before construction of the actual prototype. Analysis was made in existing <b>seal</b> rubber <b>boot,</b> showing good accuracy level when compared with actual part displacement test results. At first, critical joint motions were selected to identify the constrains and symmetric plans. The hyperelastic material was approached to an elastic material in this first step to apply in a plate element model of the part. Then the results of general part behavior, like displacements, and contacts were examined and contrasted with laboratory test reports of the real part. Prototype development time can be saved in the design phase since the part can be improved by this theoretical prediction tool. Failure points can be predicted by the analysis saving resources such as developing production tools, making prototypes and testing them to finally detect the items {{that have to be}} improved. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} finite element {{simulations}} are conducted {{based on the}} micro structure of polymers in order to transfer the information of the micro level to the macro level. The micro structure of polymers is characterized by chain-like macromolecules linked together at certain points. In this way an irregular three-dimensional network is formed. Many authors use the tool of statistical mechanics to describe the deformation behaviour of the entire network. Most of these concepts can be reformulated as traditional continuum mechanical formulations. They are, however, restricted to affine deformation, regular chain arrangements and purely elastic material behaviour. For this reason, in the present contribution, we propose a new finite element-based simulation method for polymer networks which enables us to include non-affinity and arbitrary chain configurations. It can be easily extended to include chain breakage and reconnection. The polymer structure to be investigated, e. g. a rubber <b>boot</b> or a <b>seal,</b> is discretized by means of tetrahedral elements. To each edge of a tetrahedral element one truss element is attached which models the force–stretch behaviour of a bundle of polymer chains. Each of these tetrahedral unit cells represents the micro mechanical material behaviour in a certain point of the network. The proposed method provides the possibility to observe how changes at the microscopic level influence the macroscopic material behaviour. Such information is especially valuable for the polymer industry...|$|R
