As a result of the detections it has been found that exports to the EU countries are more profitable and the entry to the market is easier than to the US.

40|$|LL. D. The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading in South African law is {{the theme}} of this study. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading in its {{traditional}} paper form is examined. The aim of the first part of the study is to reconcile the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading that is based on English law with the principles of South African law, especially regarding concepts such as possession and ownership. A plea is made for the application of South African law to <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading rather than English law exclusively. Even though English law undoubtedly forms the basis of the law governing <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading, such law should be applied in a way that is consistent with the general principles of South African law. The functions <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading are considered in detail, particularly the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading as a document of title. A submission is made of five characteristics of a document of title. The conclusion is that the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading, though based on English law concepts, can be integrated into South African law without difficulty. The subsequent examination of the transfer of contractual rights and the imposition of liabilities will show that there is a dire need for new legislation in South Africa to replace an English Act of 1855. The current proposals for such legislation are, however, in need of extensive revision. The fact that the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading only arrives at the port of destination after the goods, leads to a multitude of problems. The carrier may only deliver the goods in exchange for a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Letters of indemnity are therefore used to protect the carrier that delivers the goods without receiving a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Such indemnities will be enforceable in South African law if the carrier has no reason to suspect that the receiver of the goods is not entitled to delivery. The consideration of the nature and functions <b>of</b> the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading, enables the study to progress to an examination <b>of</b> an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. The use <b>of</b> an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading means that many problems facing the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading can be avoided. The continuing evolution <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading will be examined against the background of electronic commerce. Writing and signature requirements should not inhibit the development <b>of</b> an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. The difficulty facing the dematerialisation <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is providing for negotiability in an electronic environment, and ensuring that an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is the equivalent of an original and unique paper <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. It is possible to create an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading that performs all the functions <b>of</b> a traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading, and there are examples of the use <b>of</b> such electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading in practice. Delivery of the goods can take place by way of attomment rather than the usual symbolical delivery following the transfer <b>of</b> a paper <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. It is submitted that there is currently no need for legislative intervention to provide for electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|The Atlantic Container Line, being a {{maritime}} carrier of goods, {{introduced a new}} transportation document, which needs some explanations and a juridical analysis. The new document consists of two seperate documents: in the port <b>of</b> <b>loading</b> the shipper <b>of</b> the goods receives a freight receipt, in which all particulars concerning the goods and its transport are duly given. The shipper has a choice: instead of such a freight receipt he may ask for a normal <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. But the conditions of carriage are the same both according to the freight receipt as well as according to the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. There is only one major difference: the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading may be delivered {{to the order of}} the shipper or to the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading holder, whereas the freight receipt must bear the exact name of the consignee. In consequence the freight receipt is not a document which entitles its holder to dispose of the cargo. The freight receipt is delivered to the shipper and remains in his hands. The freight receipt is being drawn up by the carrier or his agent in the port <b>of</b> <b>loading</b> on a telex apparatus, which has a connection with the carrier's agent apparatus at the port of discharge. There, at the same time, a „notice of arrival" is being written by the telex receiver apparatus. This notice of arrival (of the cargo) is being delivered to the consignee, who with that document in hand may take delivery of the cargo. The whole terminology is a new one. Maritime law does not know a freight receipt (it knows merely a mate's receipt which has other functions) nor a notice of arrival of the cargo in form of a document of title. And therefore the legal status of these two documents, considered together as one document of transport, must be found. According to Polish civil law the two mentioned documents together may be identified with a freight bill, a document which is being met with in other branches of the transportation industry. The prefix „telex" should denote that the document is not transferred in its material form (as a piece of paper) but on„wires" with the aid of electronic apparatus. At the port of discharge the document is being drawn up once more. This facilitates enormously maritime trade if and when a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is not needed. And a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is not needed when the partners of the selling contract are in constant contact and have a full confidence that the contract will be fulfilled in the agreed manner and time. Such a situation may be found in relations between enterprises of socialist countries. Therefore the maritime telex freight bills could be successfully used in these countries.
