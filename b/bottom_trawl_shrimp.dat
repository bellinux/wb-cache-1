40|$|In Kenya, {{like other}} {{tropical}} countries, coastal artisanal fishery is multispecies, multigear and multifleet in nature with many management challenges. The Malindi-Ungwana Bay in particular, supports both the artisanal fishery and the semi-industrial <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery presenting a management challenge. Recent stock assessment surveys have identified catch {{composition of the}} semi-industrial bottom trawl fishery in the bay but artisanal catches remain barely described. This study describes, the artisanal fish catch composition (total number of species caught, sizes and trophic levels), and catch per-unit-effort (CPUE) {{for each of the}} most popular propulsion-gear categories used in the bay. We make a case that the use of specific propulsion-gear categories can be dynamically managed to encourage the recovery of selected fish groups and thus support fisheries management. A total of 4 269 finfish belonging to 177 species and 66 families were sampled by the 5 most popular propulsion-gear categories between 2009 and 2011. The total number of species caught was highest for canoe-gillnet, mashua -gillnet and foot-seine net, and lowest for foot-handline and mashua -handline. Significant differences in catch composition existed between the different propulsion-gear categories. The CPUE was not significantly different between propulsion-gear, although this was on the average highest for canoe-gillnet and mashua-gillnet, and lowest for the foot-handline. The highest trophic level of 4. 0 was recorded for mashua -gillnet and the lowest 3. 4 and 3. 2 for canoe-gillnet and foot-seine net respectively. The use of specific combinations of propulsion-gear categories, give an alternative approach in management recommendation of the coastal artisanal fisheries in the tropics, from the traditional gear-based management initiative. This study, singled out the mashua -gillnet, canoe-gillnet and foot-seine net as suitable units for monitoring the artisanal fisheries in Malindi Ungwana Bay since mashua -gillnet lands the highest mean trophic level and largest sized individuals, and canoe-gillnet and foot-seine net land the highest number of species caught and smallest sized individuals...|$|E

40|$|Trawl net is a bag-shaped gear towed through water, {{the mouth}} of which is kept open either by a frame or beam or otter boards and floats or kites and sinkers or weight.

Second, the difficulty with which floats are inserted on the float rope of the nets when they are used near the surface. Floats are inserted to replace damaged or lost floats, {{or they may be}} removed if it is desired that the nets be used in deeper waters. Floats may thus be poorly fixed to the cables and lost.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consolidate}} information presented to the Scientific Council of NAFO during 1993 – 95 on northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) on Flemish Cap. Also included are sections on oceanography of the area, general biology of the spe-cies and by-catch of fish in the commercial fishery for shrimp. Oceanographic data describe the habitat in relation to bathymetry, temperature, salin-ity and circulation. Shrimp distribution, determined from research surveys, commercial fishery data and stomach contents of cod (Gadus morhua), occurred within depths of 200 – 600 m where temperatures and salinities were approximately 4. 0 ° C and 34. 0 PSU, respec-tively. An anticyclonic gyre over the centre of the Cap dominated the circulation, provid-ing a mechanism for the retention of shrimp larvae in the area. The <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery for <b>shrimp,</b> which began in 1993, increased rapidly through the participation of vessels from several nations. Catches decreased from about 28 000 tons in 1993 to 24 000 in 1994 but increased to 33 000 in 1995.

40|$|The ivory tree coral, Oculina varicosa, {{is known}} to form reefs only in deep water (80 - 100 meters) off the central Atlantic coast of Florida. These unique reefs support high levels of biodiversity, and provide {{important}} spawning habitat for commercially important fish species such as snappers and groupers. The fragile, slow-growing Oculina reefs are easily destroyed by <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls,</b> {{and other types of}} bottom fishing gear. In 1984 the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council established the Oculina Habitat Area of Particular Concern (HAPC), banning all <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> in a portion of the reef system. The protected area was expanded in 1994 to include most of the Oculina reefs. However, recent surveys showed that about 90 % of the reefs have been destroyed, mainly by <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> for rock <b>shrimp.</b> This project is an analysis of why the Oculina reefs are almost gone despite many years of protection, and what could be done to improve enforcement and protection of the Oculina HAPC. Information was collected from literature research, and conversations with several stakeholders and experts on issues relevant to the Oculina HAPC. Four main policy problems emerged: a historical lack of enforcement in the rock shrimp fishery, continuing lack of enforcement in the snapper grouper fishery, insufficient penalties for violations of the HAPC regulations, and a lack of funding for research, enforcement, education, and outreach. The pros and cons of six potential solutions to address these problems are discussed: (1) require VMS in the snapper grouper fishery; (2) establish acoustic monitoring systems in the OECA; (3) increase penalties for violations of the Oculina HAPC; (4) increase funding for research, enforcement, education, and outreach; (5) expand the Oculina HAPC; and (6) establish part or all of the Oculina HAPC as a National Marine Sanctuary. It is important to establish effective protections for the Oculina HAPC, not only to conserve the remaining Oculina reef ecosystems, but to learn how to prevent such widespread destruction of other deep-sea coral ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) {{are widely used}} to protect exploited fish species {{as well as to}} conserve marine habitats and their biodiversity. They have also become a popular management tool for <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries, a common fishing technique on continental shelves worldwide. The effects of <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> go far beyond the impact on target species, as trawls also affect other components of the benthic ecosystem and the seabed itself. This means that for <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries, MPAs can potentially be used not only to conserve target species but also to reduce impact of these side effects of the fishery. However, predicting the protective effects of MPAs is complicated because the side effects of trawling potentially alter the food-web interactions between target and non-target species. These changes in predatory and competitive interactions among fish and benthic invertebrates may have important ramifications for MPAs as tools to manage or mitigate the effects of <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling.</b> Yet, in current theory regarding the functioning of MPAs in relation to <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries, such predatory and competitive interactions between species are generally not taken into account.
