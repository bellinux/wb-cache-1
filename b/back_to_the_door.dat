2500|$|After {{burning the}} Crandall house down, {{he returns to}} the burial ground with his wife's corpse, {{thinking}} that if he buries the body faster than he did Gage's there will be a different result.

60|$|Without {{waiting to}} be answered, she turned <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and left us.|$|E
60|$|Elsie, {{who stood}} at the window with her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> turned quickly round.|$|E
60|$|Once more {{opening his}} mouth and {{shutting}} his eyes, and laughing like a stentor, Kit gradually <b>backed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and roared himself out.|$|R
60|$|Drummond <b>backed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> with <b>the</b> red iron a {{few inches}} from his face, and when he had gone <b>the</b> smith signed <b>to</b> Driscoll.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good Lord, ma'am, don't say that! We {{can never}} rest in our beds if such things are to happen," [...] gasped Bedford, <b>backing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|Groves, who was sorely perplexed, {{stood with}} his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> which Monsieur Louis had approached.|$|E
60|$|HECTOR. Alfred! [He runs <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{and calls}} into the garden]. Randall, Mangan's Christian name is Alfred.|$|E
60|$|Acting on this idea, {{he changed}} his position, turning {{his face to the}} window and his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, sir," [...] said I, <b>backing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{and opening}} it; [...] "you {{can be as}} abusive as you like. But there is a limit. You shall not assault me." ...|$|R
60|$|Helen {{could only}} gaze {{at him as}} he <b>backed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and she thrilled and shuddered at what seemed his loyalty to her, his love for Bo, and that which was {{inevitable}} in himself.|$|R
60|$|Thus admonished to {{do their}} duty, two of the negroes took up their muskets and stood with their <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> with their {{eyes fixed on the}} {{prisoner}} with such earnestness that Vincent could not suppress a smile. The negroes grinned responsively.|$|R
60|$|Gomez {{said nothing}} for a moment. Then he drew Paul <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and pointed out into the darkness.|$|E
60|$|Miss Wilkinson was {{standing}} at the dressing-table with her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and she turned round quickly when she heard it open.|$|E

6000|$|... "What? Me! Mind her!" [...] {{burst out}} Kathleen, hotly, {{as she got}} up to go. [...] "Well, I guess not!" [...] Kathleen <b>backed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and opened it. Then making a frightful face at Lenore, most {{expressive}} of ridicule and revenge, she darted up-stairs.|$|R
60|$|Bertrade <b>backed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{commanding}} <b>the</b> {{old woman}} <b>to</b> remain where she was, on pain of death, and quickly dropped the mighty bars into place. Scarcely {{had the last}} great bolt been slipped than Peter of Colfax, with a dozen servants and men-at-arms, were pounding loudly upon the outside.|$|R
6000|$|That speech {{absolutely}} {{cleared the}} field of Harold and Dermot both.

60|$|She {{stood with}} her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> her arms outstretched like a cross. Her cheeks were livid. Her eyes seemed {{starting}} from her head.|$|E
60|$|A large man, seated {{with his}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> turned as he entered, and Owen {{recognized}} the well-remembered features of Mr Prosser, the literary loaf-slinger.|$|E
60|$|The smith walked away, and {{had only}} gone a few steps {{when he heard the}} whirr of the mill again. He went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|Now {{we should}} have been in the Sanctuary, and in the full blaze of those awful columns of living fire. But they were out, or we had strayed elsewhere; at least the {{darkness}} was intense. We tried to work our way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> again, but could not. We were lost.|$|R
60|$|I dashed <b>back,</b> leaped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> arbor, {{my hand on}} my gun.|$|R
60|$|Bennet has entered. Newte is at fireplace. The {{old ladies}} have their <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Dr. Freemantle, who is pouring out tea, is <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> see him. He {{puts down the}} teapot, staring. The old ladies look round. A silence. Newte turns. Bennet is again the perfect butler. Yesterday {{would seem to have}} been wiped out of his memory.|$|R
60|$|He {{took the}} candle and escorted his visitor <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> He {{waited on the}} landing, taper in hand, while Chauvelin descended the narrow, winding stairs.|$|E

60|$|They {{entered the}} house, and the Duke quitted the family group. About an hour afterwards, he sauntered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> music-room. As he opened <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> his eyes lighted upon May Dacre and her cousin. They were {{standing}} before the fire, with their <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> His arm was wound carelessly round her waist, and {{with his other hand}} he supported, with her, a miniature, at which she was looking.|$|R
6000|$|Bob Pillin {{took it out}} in desperation, and, {{sitting down}} at the bureau, wrote a cheque similar to that which he had torn and burned. A warm kiss lighted on his eyebrow, his head was pressed {{for a moment to}} a furry bosom; a hand took the cheque; a voice said: [...] "How delightful!"

6000|$|... 'They are not asleep yet,' muttered {{the witch}} to herself; {{and she walked}} {{up and down in the}} passage, and then came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and said: ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{that they}} were armed the Rovers and Spouter felt much safer, and they lost no time in getting <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> which they had just closed.|$|E
60|$|Maccario looked round, {{and laughed}} softly {{as he saw}} the American {{standing}} grim in face with his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and a pistol glinting in his hand.|$|E
60|$|The boys {{then went}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> barn, and, <b>to</b> their {{surprise}} and alarm, found that fastened too.|$|R
6000|$|... [TIBBY, never {{taking her}} eyes off MRS. BRADMERE, or the pipe [...] from her mouth, has <b>backed</b> stolidly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and vanished.] ...|$|R
60|$|And before M. Durand {{could prevent}} him--which {{undoubtedly}} {{he would have}} done--Achille had gone <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> study <b>door</b> and loudly knocked thereat.|$|R
