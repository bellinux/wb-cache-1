60|$|That {{the first}} of these is true may be {{gathered}} from this, That Heat is a property of a body arising from the motion or agitation of its parts; and therefore whatever body is thereby toucht must necessarily receive some part of that motion, whereby its parts will be shaken and agitated, and so by degrees free and extricate themselves from one another, and each part so moved does by that motion exert a conatus of protruding and displacing all the adjacent Particles. Thus Air included in a vessel, by being heated will burst it to pieces. Thus have I broke a Bladder held over the fire in my hand, with such a violence and noise, that it almost made me deaf for the present, and much surpassed the noise of a Musket: The like have I done by throwing into the fire small glass Bubbles hermetically sealed, with a little drop of Water included in them. Thus Water also, or any other Liquor, included in a convenient vessel, by being warmed, manifestly expands it self with a very great violence, so as to break the strongest vessel, if when heated it be narrowly imprisoned in it. This is very manifest by the Sealed Thermometers, which I have, by several tryals, at last brought to a great certainty and tenderness: for I have made some with stems above four foot long, in which the expanding Liquor would so far vary, as to be very neer the very top in the heat of Summer, and prety neer the bottom at the coldest time of the Winter. The Stems I use for them are very thick, straight, and even Pipes of Glass, with a very small perforation, and both the head and body I have made on purpose at the Glass-house, of the same metal whereof the Pipes are drawn: these I can easily in the flame of a Lamp, urged with the blast of a pair of <b>Bellows,</b> <b>seal</b> and close together, so as to remain very firm, close and even; by this means I joyn on the body first, and then fill both it and a part of the stem, proportionate to the length of the stem and the warmth of the season I fill it in with the best rectified Spirit of Wine highly ting'd with the lovely colour of Cocheneel, which I deepen the more by pouring some drops of common Spirit of Urine, which must not be too well rectified, because it will be apt to make the Liquor to curdle and stick in the small perforation of the stem. This Liquor I have upon tryal found the most tender of any spirituous Liquor, and those are much more sensibly affected with the variations of heat and cold then other more flegmatick and ponderous Liquors, and as capable of receiving a deep tincture, and keeping it, as any Liquor whatsoever; and (which makes it yet more acceptable) is not subject to be frozen by any cold yet known. When I have thus filled it, I can very easily in the forementioned flame of a Lamp seal and joyn on the head of it.|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 23 Metal <b>bellows</b> <b>seals,</b> {{originally}} {{developed for the}} aerospace/defense industry, are now widely accepted in the petrochemical, chemical, and general industrial markets. Metal <b>bellows</b> <b>seals</b> offer enhanced dynamic tracking of the seal rings because they eliminate dynamic secondary seals. They are ideally suited for difficult high temperature applications, {{like those in the}} petrochemical industry that demand enhanced seal reliability. An effective means of ensuring seal reliability is by controlling face distortion, which directly affects the operating conditions at the sealing surface. When designing a seal, it is necessary to consider distortion resulting from pressure, the presence of temperature gradients {{in the area of the}} interface, and stress relaxation of interference fit components. All three of these factors can result in distortion of the face and changes to the lubricating fluid film thickness between the faces. Historically, to reduce stress relaxation of interference fit components in high temperature applications, material selection was limited to materials with a coefficient of thermal expansion similar to that of the seal ring insert. Recently, innovative design and manufacturing technology has made it possible to offer metal <b>bellows</b> <b>seals</b> made of corrosion resistant alloys for high temperature applications (up to 800 degrees F). This design controls face distortion at elevated temperatures. It does this through design rather than material selection, which limits the applicability of the seal.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the iterative process and steps taken {{to build a}} tidal power generator which works efficiently while causing no harm to marine life or habitat. A tidal power generator is a device that converts the mechanical energy from the horizontal tides in the ocean (or any flowing water body) into electrical energy. The design was undertaken as an interdisciplinary capstone project for seniors in mechanical and electrical engineering. The results {{will be used for}} research purposes in determining the efficiency of the specific design used and the overall feasibility of tidal power generation. A preliminary prototype consisting of the mechanical linkages and an airfoil was built and tested in the air to prove the various concepts employed work. Based on the results obtained, a full scale model was built and tested in the wind tunnel. An elliptical airfoil was used in harnessing the mechanical energy from the tidal flow. A deflector mounted on the system was to make the elliptical airfoil work bi-directionally. The mechanical linkage consisted of a belt and four sprockets which enable the generator to only see rotary motion in one direction. Finally, a small electric motor was used as a generator to convert the mechanical energy harnessed into electrical energy. The tests performed show that tidal power generation through airfoils is a viable technology with a lot of potential. Using a bi-symmetric airfoil, 5 mW of power was produced with a small six volt motor in 40 miles/hour wind, with the airfoil moving at over 200 rpm. Rudimentary testing of the same system with an 85 % efficient permanent magnet DC generator shows possibilities of over 50 W. Given more time in the wind tunnel and the water tunnel (which were fully occupied by graduate students and broken respectively), more elaborate tests could have been performed on the tidal generator. Some improvements which can be made to the system include using lighter <b>bellows</b> <b>seals</b> that can collapse under their own weight, this would decrease the force required to move the airfoil and hence increase the rpm and power generation. Also, an improved design should include a control system that takes into account the flow speed of the water and consequently adjusts the angle of attack of the airfoil. The switching mechanism for the airfoil should also be improved to allow for bi-directional functionality of the system. The system met the majority of its functional requirements and with some minor improvements and more testing {{has the potential to be}} very successful...|$|R

40|$|Historically, {{cryogenic}} pumps {{used for}} propellant loading at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and other NASA Centers have a <b>bellows</b> mechanical <b>seal</b> and oil bath ball bearings, {{both of which}} can be problematic and require high maintenance. Because of the extremely low temperatures, the mechanical seals are made of special materials and design, have wearing surfaces, are subject to improper installation, and commonly are a potential leak path. The ball bearings are non-precision bearings [ABEC- 1 (Annular Bearing Engineering Council) ] and are lubricated using LOX compatible oil. This oil is compatible with the propellant to prevent explosions, but does not have good lubricating properties. Due to the poor lubricity, it has been a goal of the KSC cryogenics community for the last 15 years to develop a magnetically coupled pump, which would eliminate these two potential issues. A number of projects have been attempted, but none of the pumps was a success. An off-the-shelf magnetically coupled pump (typically used with corrosive fluids) was procured that has been used for hypergolic service at KSC. The KSC Cryogenics Test Lab (CTL) operated the pump in cryogenic LN 2 as received to determine a baseline for modifications required. The pump bushing, bearings, and thrust rings failed, and the pump would not flow liquid (this is a typical failure mode that was experienced in the previous attempts). Using the knowledge gained over the years designing and building cryogenic pumps, the CTL determined alternative materials that would be suitable for use under the pump design conditions. The CTL procured alternative materials for the bearings (bronze, aluminum bronze, and glass filled PTFE) and machined new bearing bushings, sleeves, and thrust rings. The designed clearances among the bushings, sleeves, thrust rings, case, and case cover were altered once again using experience gained from previous cryogenic pump rebuilds and designs. The alternative material parts were assembled into the pump, and the pump was successfully operated meeting all expected operating parameters. Unique pump sub-assembly parts were designed and manufactured by the CTL using specialized materials determined to be superior for cryogenic thermal applications under the pump design conditions. This work is a proof-of-concept/proof-of-operation of the pump only. Other known internal design modifications to the pump should be accomplished for the long-term use of the pump. An upscaled version of this pump, which is under development and testing at the CTL, can be used either for current or future vehicle loading or for vehicle replenishment. Scaling of this pump can be easily accomplished...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—The American Thoracic Society (ATS) {{has set the}} {{acceptable}} resistance for spirometers at less than 1. 5 cm H 2 O/l/s over the flow range 0 - 14 l/s and for monitoring devices at less than 2. 5 cm H 2 O/l/s (0 - 14 l/s). The aims {{of this study were}} to determine the resistance characteristics of commonly used spirometers and monitoring devices and the effect of resistance on ventilatory function.  METHODS—The resistance of five spirometers (Vitalograph wedge <b>bellows,</b> Morgan rolling <b>seal,</b> Stead Wells water sealed, Fleisch pneumotachograph, Lilly pneumotachograph) and three monitoring devices (Spiro 1,Ferraris, mini-Wright) was measured from the back pressure developed over a range of known flows (1. 6 - 13. 1 l/s). Peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory flow in one second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and mid forced expiratory flow (FEF 25 - 75 %) were measured on six subjects with normal lung function and 13 subjects with respiratory disorders using a pneumotachograph. Ventilatory function was then repeated with four different sized resistors (approximately 1 - 11 cmH 2 O/l/s) inserted between the mouthpiece and pneumotachograph.  RESULTS—All five diagnostic spirometers and two of the three monitoring devices passed the ATS upper limit for resistance. PEF, FEV 1 and FVC showed significant (p< 0. 05) inverse correlations with added resistance with {{no significant difference between the}} normal and patient groups. At a resistance of 1. 5 cm H 2 O/l/s the mean percentage falls (95 % confidence interval) were: PEF 6. 9 % (5. 4 to 8. 3); FEV 1 1. 9 % (1. 0 to 2. 8), and FVC 1. 5 % (0. 8 to 2. 3).  CONCLUSIONS—The ATS resistance specification for diagnostic spirometers appears to be appropriate. However, the specification for monitoring devices may be too conservative. PEF was found to be the most sensitive index to added resistance. ...|$|R
40|$|The term {{precision}} linear actuator, {{direct drive}} (PLADD) {{refers to a}} robust linear actuator designed {{to be capable of}} repeatedly performing, over a lifetime of the order of 5 to 10 years, positioning maneuvers that include, variously, submicron increments or slews of the order of a centimeter. The PLADD is capable of both long stroke (120 mm) and high resolution (repeatable increments of 20 nm). Unlike precise linear actuators of prior design, the PLADD contains no gears, levers, or hydraulic converters. The PLADD, now at the prototype stage of development, is intended for original use as a coarse-positioning actuator in a spaceborne interferometer. The PLADD could also be adapted to terrestrial applications in which there are requirements for long stroke and high resolution: potential applications include medical imaging and fabrication of semiconductor devices. The PLADD (see figure) includes a commercially available ball-screw actuator driven directly by a commercially available three-phase brushless DC motor. The ball-screw actuator comprises a spring-preloaded ball nut on a ball screw that is restrained against rotation as described below. The motor is coupled directly (that is, without an intervening gear train) to a drive link that, in turn, is coupled to the ball nut. By eliminating the gear train, the direct-drive design eliminates the complexity, backlash, and potential for misalignment associated with a gear train. To prevent inadvertent movement, there is a brake that includes flexured levers compressed against the drive link by preload springs. This is a power-off brake: There are also piezoelectric stacks that can be activated to oppose the springs and push the levers away from the drive link. Hence, power must be applied to the piezoelectric stacks to release the drive link from braking. To help ensure long operational life, all of the mechanical drive components are immersed in an oil bath within hermetically <b>sealed</b> <b>bellows.</b> The outer end of the bellows holds the outer end of the ball screw, thereby preventing rotation of the ball screw. Positioning is controlled by an electronic control system that includes digital and analog subsystems that interact with the motor and brake and with two sensor/encoder units: a Hall-effect-sensor rotation encoder and a linear glass-scale encoder. This system implements a proportional + integral + derivative control algorithm that results in variation of voltage commands to each of the three pairs of windings of the brushless DC motor. In one of two alternative control modes, the voltages are applied to the windings in a trapezoidal commutation scheme on the basis of timing signals obtained from the Hall-effect sensors; this scheme yields relatively coarse positioning - 24 steps per motor revolution. The second control mode involves a sinusoidal commutation scheme in which the output of the linear glass-scale encoder is transposed to rotational increments to yield much finer position feedback - more than 400, 000 steps per revolution...|$|R
