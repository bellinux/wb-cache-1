Though his receiving stats were a low 7 receptions for 41 yards and no touchdowns his game took a turn in a more positive direction as an interior blocker as well as moving to Fullback in place of a suspended and injured Javorskie Lane. His ability to be an effective lead blocker earned great praise and a new role as a blocking full back after the team let last years lead <b>blocking</b> <b>machine</b> Erik Lorig go via free agency. He also was a solid special teams contributor.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{considers}} a production line with continuous loading {{at the first}} automation service station or machine and buffers placed forward the queuers. Each machine operates within an indefinite service time. There is much data available on modeling {{and analysis of the}} transfer lines. However, most of the results are for the steady-state operation. The system under consideration operates within the finite time interval. A method is suggested to study the production line. According to the method, we chart the system operation process; calculate of distribution formula for the remaining durations of time period of the system being in the states marked at the chart. Then we calculate the state indexes. A detailed description of the states allows calculating, for example, <b>blocking</b> <b>machine</b> indexes and machine down time probabilities and durations...|$|E

To improve design efficiency of the gypsum hollow <b>block</b> forming <b>machine,</b> shorten the product design and development cycle, {{meet the needs of}} medium investors and product upgrading, enable enterprises to quickly respond to market demand. According to the structural characteristics and working principle of gypsum <b>block</b> forming <b>machine,</b> threeâ€”dimensional solid model, virtual assembly design and motion simulation of a gypsum <b>block</b> <b>machine</b> were realized by parametric design and motion simulation based on UG 3 D software. It improves design quality, facilitates optimal design of forming machines, and helps to enhance product development capabilities. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we address}} {{issues in the}} specification, simulation, and formal {{verification}} of systems that are characterzed by real-time constraints and a mix of protocol and data computation aspects. We propose a novel specification language and modeling methodology [...] HAAD (Hierarchical Annotated Action Diagrams). In HAAD, the interface behavior or a system is captured as a hierarchy of action diagrams. The internal behavior is modeled by an Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM). A leaf action diagram defines a behavior (a template) over a set of ports. Procedures and predicates are attached to actions in order to describe the functional aspects of the interface. We propose algorithms and methods for the automatic generation of simulation models and response verification scripts from HAAD specifications. These models perform "on-the-fly parsing" of actions received at their I/O ports, sequencing through state transitions based on {{the result of this}} parsing, detecting incorrect, or ill-formed interface operations (bus cycles), verifying that all timing constraints at the input of the model are met, and driving the model outputs with appropriate delays. We formalize the operational semantics of leaf action diagrams under linear timing constraints, based on the concepts of a <b>block</b> <b>machine</b> and causal <b>block</b> <b>machine.</b> We state the realizability of an action diagram in terms of the existence of a causal <b>block</b> <b>machine</b> derived from the action diagram. We examine the problem of the compatability of concurrent, communicating leaf action diagrams described by linear timing constraints and we show the inaccuracies of known methods that address this problem. We define the action diagram compatibility problem in terms of the compatibility of all the possible combinations of causal <b>block</b> <b>machines</b> derived form these action diagrams. We prove that such enumeration is not needed in answering the compatibility question. This leads to an exact and efficient compatibility verification procedure...|$|R

The arrangements for lubrication include a pump which floods the dies, and in many cases also the bottom portions of the blocks run in lubricant.|$|R
