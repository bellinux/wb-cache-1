5|$|Unlike their {{toothed whale}} counterparts, baleen whales {{are hard to}} study because of their immense size. Intelligence tests such as the mirror test cannot be done because their <b>bulk</b> <b>and</b> lack of body {{language}} makes a reaction impossible to be definitive. However, studies on the brains of humpback whales revealed spindle cells, which, in humans, control theory of mind.

5|$|A {{series of}} {{meetings}} involving Wooten, Barbey, Edmund Herring (Wooten's superior as commander of I Corps), Colonel Merian C. Cooper from the Fifth Air Force, and Air Commodore Joe Hewitt from the RAAF, reached agreement, or at least compromise, on many points. Wooten wanted at least 10 days' reserve rations. This meant that some stores {{would have to be}} transported in <b>bulk,</b> <b>and</b> not pre-loaded on trucks as Barbey initially wanted. Loading the stores onto trucks was an inefficient use of shipping space, but permitted quick unloading of the LSTs, as the trucks could simply be driven off. The 9th Division did not have sufficient trucks for this, but 200 trucks earmarked for the US Advanced Base at Lae were borrowed from USASOS. Barbey would not allow loaded vehicles on the tank decks of the LSTs, as this was a fire hazard, so bulk stores were carried there instead.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how ctenophores control their buoyancy, but experiments {{have shown that}} some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities. Their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater. If they enter less dense brackish water, the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its <b>bulk</b> <b>and</b> decrease its density, to avoid sinking. Conversely if they move from brackish to full-strength seawater, the rosettes may pump {{water out of the}} mesoglea to reduce its volume and increase its density.|$|E

5|$|Liquids can {{interact}} with two main types of solid surfaces. Traditionally, solid surfaces have been divided into high-energy solids and low-energy types. The relative {{energy of a}} solid {{has to do with}} the bulk nature of the solid itself. Solids such as metals, glasses, and ceramics are known as 'hard solids' because the chemical bonds that hold them together (e.g., covalent, ionic, or metallic) are very strong. Thus, it takes a large input of energy to break these solids (alternatively large amount of energy is required to cut the <b>bulk</b> <b>and</b> make two separate surfaces so high surface energy), so they are termed “high energy”. Most molecular liquids achieve complete wetting with high-energy surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Milk was an {{important}} source of animal protein for those who could not afford meat. It would mostly come from cows, but milk from goats and sheep was also common. Plain fresh milk was not consumed by adults except the poor or sick, and was usually reserved for the very young or elderly. Poor adults would sometimes drink buttermilk or whey or milk that was soured or watered down. Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products {{because of the lack of}} technology to keep it from spoiling. On occasion it was used in upper-class kitchens in stews, but it was difficult to keep fresh in <b>bulk</b> <b>and</b> almond milk was generally used in its stead.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} study on the effects of size distribution, {{moisture}} content and oil addition on <b>bulk</b> density <b>and</b> angle of repose of coal. The experimental work includes four stages. The first stage is to develop reliable experimental techniques. The results confirm that ASTM cubic foot test is reliable for measurement of <b>bulk</b> density <b>and</b> angle of repose if properly operated, although the latter is better measured in a piling process. Stages 2 and 3 are to investigate the effects of size distribution by using - 3. 55 mm% for stage 2 and mean size do. s for stage 3, water content and oil addition on <b>bulk</b> density <b>and</b> angle of repose of coal. For each of them, empirical equations are formulated to predict <b>bulk</b> density <b>and</b> angle of repose. The results indicate that the fraction - 3. 55 mm cutting size in stage 2 does not affect bulk density significantly, while the increase of do. s decreases bulk density to a minimum and then increases. Particle size distribution does not affect angle of repose much. The increase of moisture content decreases <b>bulk</b> density <b>and</b> increases angle of repose significantly. The increase of oil addition increases bulk density while decreases angle of repose significantly. The correlation between <b>bulk</b> density <b>and</b> angle of repose can also be observed: the higher bulk density, the lower angle of repose. There are other variables affecting <b>bulk</b> density <b>and</b> angle of repose. They include oil type, absorption time discharging height and external loading. Their effects on <b>bulk</b> density <b>and</b> angle of repose are quantified in stage 4. The results suggest that, a higher discharging position or larger external loading increase bulk density significantly. Angle of repose decreases when increase the height of discharging position. Diesel oil performed better than waste oil addition in terms of bulk density enhancement. For most of the cases examined, <b>bulk</b> density <b>and</b> angle of repose become stable after ~ 24 hours oil absorption time...|$|R
5|$|Usually {{found near}} the sea floor, the bowmouth {{guitarfish}} prefers sandy or muddy areas near underwater structures. It is a strong-swimming predator of bony fishes, crustaceans, and molluscs. This species gives live birth to litters {{of two to}} eleven pups, which are nourished during gestation by yolk. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the bowmouth guitarfish as Vulnerable because it is widely caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries for its valuable fins and meat. It {{is viewed as a}} nuisance by trawlers, however, because its <b>bulk</b> <b>and</b> thorny skin cause it to damage netted catches. Habitat degradation and destruction pose an additional, significant challenge to this ray's survival. The bowmouth guitarfish adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquariums.|$|E
5|$|The {{riverside}} façade {{is formed}} by the main residential <b>bulk</b> <b>and</b> the library wing on the west side, which offers a contrast in shape and design, notably through its single, very large window. The {{main part of the}} façade is symmetrically arranged around an avant-corps of four columns with Corinthian capitals. The avant-corps is crowned with a voluminous triangular pediment, again adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan, while the library wing is crowned with a semicircular pediment. That pediment was originally surmounted by two copper statues of angels, now lost. The library wing {{was not part of the}} original 1727 plan but was conceived in 1733, after the cardinal bought up and demolished a row of houses on the current rue de Rohan. The architect, Robert de Cotte, was thus able to distribute the interior spaces of the residential bulk on an even grander and also more practical plan, notably putting the main staircase to the left (east) of the apartment wing instead of the centre.|$|E

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between activated-sludge <b>bulking</b> <b>and</b> levels of specific filamentous bacteria, we developed a statistics-based quantification method for estimating the biomass levels of specific filaments using 16 S rRNA-targeted fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) probes. The results of quantitative FISH for the filament Sphaerotilus natans were similar to the results of quantitative membrane hybridization in a sample from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant. Laboratory-scale reactors were operated under different flow conditions to develop <b>bulking</b> <b>and</b> nonbulking sludge and were bioaugmented with S. natans cells to stimulate bulking. Instead of S. natans, the filament Eikelboom type 1851 became dominant in the reactors. Levels of type 1851 filaments extending out of the flocs correlated strongly with the sludge volume index, and extended filament lengths of approximately 6 × 108 μm ml− 1 resulted in <b>bulking</b> in laboratory-scale <b>and</b> full-scale activated-sludge samples. Quantitative FISH showed that high levels of filaments occurred inside the flocs in nonbulking sludge, supporting the “substrate diffusion limitation” hypothesis for bulking. The approach will allow the monitoring of incremental improvements in <b>bulking</b> control methods <b>and</b> the delineation of the operational conditions that lead to bulking due to specific filaments...|$|R
