5|$|Smoking {{legislation}} in North Korea has tightened in recent years, {{although it is}} still relatively lax and has not had any really meaningful effect on curtailing smoking rates. The rules on where people can or cannot smoke are complex, with smoking prohibited on sidewalks, ferries, airplanes and at stations, in health-care and educational facilities, kindergartens and nurseries, shops, theaters, cinemas, culture halls and conference rooms, historic and battle sites, and hotel lobbies. However, smoking is not prohibited in either private or work vehicles or on-board trains, at bus stops, near entrances to buildings, in universities, government offices, workplaces, restaurants, cafes, <b>bars,</b> <b>or</b> nightclubs.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{repeal of}} Prohibition and {{the passage of}} the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, the ABC issued {{regulations}} that prohibited bars and liquor stores from selling alcohol to a person under 21, which was considered the age of majority at that time. In 1939, it became a criminal offense to sell alcohol to a person under 21, and for a person under 21 to purchase or consume alcohol in a licensed establishment. The state criminalized the underage possession of alcohol in motor vehicles and other public areas in 1957, possibly in response to young New Jerseyans traveling to New York, where the drinking age was 18, and returning home with liquor. For many years laws against underage drinking and the serving of alcohol to minors did not apply on private property, though an adult who supplied a substantial amount of liquor to an underage person could possibly be prosecuted for contributing to the delinquency of a minor Furthermore, arrests and criminal prosecutions for underage drinking in <b>bars</b> <b>or</b> public areas were very uncommon before the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The first event, {{the light}} plane, {{requires}} the player {{to follow a}} guide path of orbs, or to fly through rings of orbs, and then land on the runway. In the second event, skydiving, the player jumps from a helicopter at a high altitude and maneuvers by leaning forward and back, and by rotating on a horizontal axis. The player must fall through rings of orbs in the sky before deploying the parachute, and must then attempt to land in a target area made up of concentric circles, with marks indicating the points awarded. The third event sees the player taking control of a rocket belt, which can be controlled with left and right yaw rotation, leaning forward and back to control speed. High {{and low levels of}} thrust allow high speed and finer control, respectively. The player must take off and fly through a series of rings, <b>bars,</b> <b>or</b> other objects before landing in a target area. The objective of the fourth event, hang gliding, is to catch thermal currents (represented by ascending white dots), reach a specified altitude, and then land {{as close as possible to}} the center of a gray square target.|$|E
50|$|An adult bar/bat mitzvah is a <b>bar</b> <b>or</b> bat mitzvah of {{a person}} older than the {{customary}} age. Traditionally, a <b>bar</b> <b>or</b> bat mitzvah occurs at age 13 and 12 {{for boys and girls}} respectively. But many adult Jews who have never had a <b>bar</b> <b>or</b> bat mitzvah choose to have one later in life, and many who have had one at the traditional age choose to have a second. An adult <b>bar</b> <b>or</b> bat mitzvah can be held at any age after adulthood is reached and can be performed in a variety of ways.|$|R

25|$|Cold Drawing, ProcessDrawing: In this process, the {{material}} being drawn is {{at room temperature}} (i.e. Cold-Drawn). The pointed/reduced end of the <b>bar</b> <b>or</b> coil, which is smaller than the die opening, is passed through the die where it enters a gripping device of the drawing machine. The drawing machine pulls or draws the remaining unreduced section of the <b>bar</b> <b>or</b> coil through the die. The die reduces the {{cross section of the}} original <b>bar</b> <b>or</b> coil, shapes the profile of the product and increases the length of the original product.|$|R

25|$|In {{contrast}} to using traditional <b>bars</b> <b>or</b> coiled wires of all-metal solder and manually applying flux {{to the parts}} being joined, much hand soldering since the mid-20th century has used flux-core solder. This is manufactured as a coiled wire of solder, {{with one or more}} continuous bodies of inorganic acid or rosin flux embedded lengthwise inside it. As the solder melts onto the joint, it frees the flux and releases that on it as well.|$|E

The monkey bar designation was for the resemblance that playing children had to the rambunctious, climbing play of monkeys, though the term nowadays often refers specifically to a single row of overhead bars designed to be swung across.

25|$|The working {{conditions}} from these brothels {{have also been}} criticized by many. During the 1970s and early 1980s, several towns had enacted rules prohibiting local brothel prostitutes from frequenting local <b>bars</b> <b>or</b> casinos or associating with local men outside of work. After a lawsuit was filed in 1984, these regulations had to be abandoned, {{but as a result}} of collaboration between sheriffs and brothel owners, they remain in effect unofficially. For instance, most brothels do not allow the prostitutes to leave the premises during their work shifts of several days to several weeks.|$|E
