40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} statistical mechanical {{analysis of the}} conformational properties of a stiff polyelectrolyte chain with intrachain attractions that are due to counterion correlations. We show that the mean-field solution corresponds to an Euler-like <b>buckling</b> <b>instability.</b> The effect of the conformational fluctuations on the <b>buckling</b> <b>instability</b> is investigated, first, qualitatively, within the harmonic (``semiclassical'') theory, then, systematically, within a 1 /d-expansion, where d denotes the dimension of embedding space. Within the ``semiclassical'' approximation, we predict {{that the effect of}} fluctuations is to renormalize the effective persistence length to smaller values, but not to change the nature of the mean-field (i. e., buckling) behavior. Based on the 1 /d-expansion we are, however, led to conclude that thermal fluctuations are responsible for a change of the buckling behavior which is turned into a polymer collapse. A phase diagram is constructed in which a sequence of collapse transitions terminates at a <b>buckling</b> <b>instability</b> that occurs at a place that varies with the magnitude of the bare persistence length of the polymer chain, {{as well as with the}} strength and range of the attractive potential.

40|$|Oriented block {{copolymers}} {{exhibit a}} <b>buckling</b> <b>instability</b> when {{submitted to a}} tensile test perpendicular to the lamellae direction. In this paper we study this behavior using a coarse grained molecular dynamics simulation approach. Coarse grained models of lamellar copolymers with alternate glassy rubbery layers are generated using the Radical Like Polymerization method, and their mechanical response is studied. For large enough systems, uniaxial tensile tests perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} lamellae reveal the occurrence of the <b>buckling</b> <b>instability</b> at low strain. The results that emerge from molecular simulation are compared to an elastic theory of the <b>buckling</b> <b>instability</b> introduced by Read and coworkers. At high strain rates, significant differences are observed between elastic theory and simulation results for the buckling strain and the buckling wavelength. We explain this difference by the strain rate dependence of the mechanical response. A simple model that takes into account the influence of the strain rate in the mechanical response is presented to rationalize the results at low and moderate strain rates. At very high strain rates, cavitation takes place in the rubbery phase of the sample and limits the validity of the approach...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a suspended elastic rod under longitudinal compression. The compression {{can be used}} to adjust potential energy for transverse displacements from harmonic to double well regime. As compressional strain is increased to the <b>buckling</b> <b>instability,</b> the frequency of fundamental vibrational mode drops continuously to zero (first <b>buckling</b> <b>instability).</b> As one tunes the separation between ends of a rod, the system remains stable beyond the instability and develops a double well potential for transverse motion. The two minima in potential energy curve describe two possible buckled states at a particular strain. From one buckled state it can go over to the other by thermal fluctuations or quantum tunnelling. Using a continuum approach and transition state theory (TST) one can calculate the rate of conversion from one state to other. Saddle point for the change from one state to other is the straight rod configuration. The rate, however, diverges at the second <b>buckling</b> <b>instability.</b> At this point, the straight rod configuration, which was a saddle till then, becomes hill top and two new saddles are generated. The new saddles have bent configurations and as rod goes through further instabilities, they remain stable and the rate calculated according to harmonic approximation around saddle point remains finite. In our earlier paper classical rate calculation including friction has been carried out [J. Comput. Theor. Nanosci. 4 (2007) 1], by assuming that each segment of the rod is coupled to its own collection of harmonic oscillators - our rate expression is well behaved through the second <b>buckling</b> <b>instability.</b> In this paper we have extended our method to calculate quantum rate using the same system plus reservoir model. We find that friction lowers the rate of conversion. Comment: 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Based on the {{theories}} of thermal elasticity mechanics and nonlocal elasticity, an elastic Bernoulli–Euler beam model is developed for thermal-mechanical vibration and <b>buckling</b> <b>instability</b> of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) conveying fluid and resting on an elastic medium.

The effects of temperature change, nonlocal parameter and elastic medium constant on the vibration frequency and <b>buckling</b> <b>instability</b> of SWCNT conveying fluid are investigated. It can be concluded that at low or room temperature, the fundamental natural frequency and critical flow velocity for the SWCNT increase as the temperature change increases.

40|$|The {{structure}} {{and evolution of}} the stellar velocity ellipsoid {{plays an important role}} in shaping galaxies undergoing bar driven secular evolution and the eventual formation of a boxy/peanut bulge such as present in the Milky Way. Using collisionless N-body simulations, we show that during the formation of such a boxy/peanut bulge, the meridional shear stress of stars, which can be measured by the meridional tilt of the velocity ellipsoid, reaches a characteristic peak in its time evolution. It is shown that the onset of a bar <b>buckling</b> <b>instability</b> is closely connected to the maximum meridional tilt of the stellar velocity ellipsoid. Our findings bring new insight to this complex gravitational instability of the bar which complements the <b>buckling</b> <b>instability</b> studies based on orbital models.

40|$|We {{investigate}} buckling of soft elastic capsules under {{negative pressure}} or for reduced capsule volume. Based on nonlinear shell {{theory and the}} assumption of a hyperelastic capsule membrane, shape equations for axisymmetric and initially spherical capsules are derived and solved numerically. A rich bifurcation behavior is found, which is presented in terms of bifurcation diagrams. The energetically preferred stable configuration is deduced from a least-energy principle both for prescribed volume and prescribed pressure. We find that buckled shapes are energetically favorable already at smaller negative pressures and larger critical volumes than predicted by the classical <b>buckling</b> <b>instability.</b> By preventing self-intersection for strongly reduced volume, we obtain a complete picture of the buckling process and can follow the shape from the initial undeformed state through the <b>buckling</b> <b>instability</b> into the fully collapsed state. Interestingly, the sequences of bifurcations and stable capsule shapes differ for prescribed volume and prescribed pressure.

40|$|The fluid-structure {{interaction}} (FSI) for two simple fuel assemblies is {{studied by}} numerical method {{to remedy the}} deficiencies of theoretical and experimental methods. All the rods are considered as cylinders, modeled by Euler-Bernoulli beams, and are free to vibrate in any transverse directions. The FSI is simulated by the explicit partitioned scheme, in which the flow and structure solvers exchange the data within one time step to implement their coupling for FSI. The flow solver is the commercial CFD software Fluent and the structure solver is in-house developed beam solver, which is integrated into Fluent by the user-defined functions. The effects of dimensionless flow velocity and the number of cylinders on the dynamics of the fuel assemblies are investigated in detail. For small dimensionless flow velocity, the strong vibration is damped into weak oscillation induced by turbulence. If the dimensionless flow velocity is large enough, the <b>buckling</b> <b>instability</b> occurs.

In the smectic phase, the topological and geometrical constraints of the spherical shell imposed on the developing 1 D quasi-long-range order create a conflict that triggers a series of <b>buckling</b> <b>instabilities.</b> Two different characteristic defect patterns arise, one driven by the curvature of the shell, the other by the strong nonuniformities in the director field {{in the vicinity of}} the topological defects...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we report on}} an {{investigation}} of an elastic <b>buckling</b> <b>instability</b> as a driving force for the roughening of polystyrene, a model resist, during Ar+ plasma etching. Polystyrene films etched by pure Ar+ plasma with different ion energies were characterized using both atomic force microscopy topography and force curve measurements. By using height-height correlation function in analyzing the AFM measured topography images, we find that surface corrugation of etched polystyrene film surfaces all display a dominant wrinkle wavelength (ë), which {{is a function of}} ion energy. Next, we characterized the mechanical properties of these samples using AFM force curve measurements in an controlled ambient environment. We analyzed the measured force curves using a systematic algorithm based on statistical fitting procedures, and taking into account the adhesive interaction, {{in order to determine the}} effective elastic modulus of the films. We find that the effective elastic modulus (EBL) of the etched samples increases monotonically with increasing ion energy, but the changes are rather subtle as compared to the elastic modulus (EPS) of the unetched one. In order to test the validity of a <b>buckling</b> <b>instability</b> as the mechanism for surface roughening in our polystyrene-Ar plasma system, the elastic modulus of individual layer (i. e. ion-damaged layer plus unmodified foundation) needs to be determined. We present a determination of the damaged layer elastic modulus (EDL) from the effective elastic modulus of the damaged layer/polystyrene bilayer structure (EBL), based upon a finite element method simulation taking into account the thickness and elastic modulus of the damaged layers. We extract the damaged layer elastic modulus versus etching ion energy initially within the approximation of a spherical tip in contact with a flat sample surface. We next extend our model, by considering a periodic corrugated film surface, with its amplitude and wavelength determined by AFM, to take into account the effect of roughness induced by plasma exposure. The damaged layer elastic modulus extracted from these two approximations gives of quantitative agreement, and thus evidence for the correlation between <b>buckling</b> <b>instability</b> and plasma-induced roughening...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe analyze folding {{phenomena}} in finely layered viscoelastic rock. Fine is meant {{in the sense}} that the thickness of each layer is considerably smaller than characteristic structural dimensions. For this purpose we derive constitutive relations and apply a computational simulation scheme (a finite-element based particle advection scheme; see MORESI et al., 2001) suitable for problems involving very large deformations of layered viscous and viscoelastic rocks. An algorithm for the time integration of the governing equations as well as details of the finite-element implementation is also given. We then consider <b>buckling</b> <b>instabilities</b> in a finite, rectangular domain. Embedded within this domain, parallel to the longer dimension we consider a stiff, layered plate. The domain is compressed along the layer axis by prescribing velocities along the sides. First, for the viscous limit we consider the response to a series of harmonic perturbations of the director orientation. The Fourier spectra of the initial folding velocity are compared for different viscosity ratios. Turning to the nonlinear regime we analyze viscoelastic folding histories up to 40 % shortening. The effect of layering manifests itself in that appreciable <b>buckling</b> <b>instabilities</b> are obtained at much lower viscosity ratios (1 : 10) as is required for the buckling of isotropic plates (1 : 500). The wavelength induced by the initial harmonic perturbation of the director orientation seems to be persistent. In the section of the parameter space considered here elasticity seems to delay or inhibit the occurrence of a second, larger wavelength. Finally, in a linear instability analysis we undertake a brief excursion into the potential role of couple stresses on the folding process. The linear instability analysis also provides insight into the expected modes of deformation at the onset of instability, and the different regimes of behavior one might expect to observe...|$|R
