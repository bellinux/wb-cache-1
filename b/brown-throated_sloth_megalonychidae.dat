50|$|The <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> (Bradypus variegatus) is {{a species}} of three-toed sloth found in the neotropical ecozone.|$|R
5000|$|The seven {{recognized}} subspecies of the <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth,</b> {{although these}} are not all readily distinguishable, are: ...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the algae in their fur, <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloths</b> also live commensally with a species of moth, Cryptoses choloepi, which lives in their fur, and lays its eggs in the dung.Jaguars and harpy eagles are among the few natural predators of the <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth.</b> The yellow-headed caracara has been observed to forage for small invertebrates in the fur of the sloths, apparently without the sloth being disturbed by the attention.|$|R
50|$|The pygmy three-toed sloth is {{significantly}} {{smaller than the}} other members of its genus, but otherwise resembles the <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth.</b> According to Anderson and Handley Jr., the head-and-body length is between 48 and 53 cm, and the body mass ranges from 2.5 to 3.5 kg. The <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> is nearly 40% heavier and 15% smaller in head-and-body length than the pygmy three-toed <b>sloth.</b> Moreover, the <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> is lighter on the crown. The face is buff to tan; a dark band runs across the brow, surrounded by an orange patch. The throat is gray to brown, lighter than the underbelly; the dark brown back is spotted and has a dark stripe along the midline. Facial hair is short, while the long, rough hair on the crown and shoulders forms a hood. The grayish limbs have three claws each. The tail is 4.5 to 6 cm long.|$|R
25|$|The {{representative}} species include white-headed capuchin, {{mantled howler}} and spider monkeys, <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth,</b> paca, kinkajou, coatimundi tayra, Central American otter, puma, collared peccary, white-lipped peccary and red brocket.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brown-throated</b> <b>sloths</b> {{inhabit the}} high canopy of the forest, where they eat young leaves {{from a wide}} range of {{different}} trees. They do not travel far, with home ranges of only around 0.5 to 9 ha, depending on the local environment. Within a typical, 5 ha range, a <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> will visit around 40 trees, and may specialise on one particular species, even spending up to 20% of its time in a single specific tree. Thus, although the species are generalists, individual sloths may feed on a relatively narrow range of leaf types.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The term [...] "Paratheria" [...] was {{proposed}} {{as a result}} of the hypothesis that edentates, such as this <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> (Bradypus variegatus), are distinct from other placental mammals.|$|R
50|$|Terrestrial mammals {{include the}} {{introduced}} white-headed capuchin, <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth,</b> Gorgona spiny rat and the agouti. As well, {{there are over}} a dozen species of bat found on the island.|$|R
40|$|As human population, food consumption, and {{the demand}} for forest {{products}} continue to rise, the pressures of land use change on biodiversity are projected to intensify. In tropical regions, countryside habitats and conventional agricultural practices that retain abundant tree cover and a structurally complex canopy may provide habitats and landscape connectivity for many taxa. This research aimed to assess how the spatial distribution of a dispersal-limited mammal, the <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> (Bradypus variegatus), is shaped by differences in the structure and configuration of countryside habitats in Costa Rica, using a multi-scale framework. I conducted two studies to better understand the spatial ecology of <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloths,</b> and identify specific conservation opportunities for the species. First, data on sloth occurrence was collected from line-transect surveys within countryside habitats (i. e., plantations and mixed-use areas). Subsequently, I developed a density surface map to pinpoint hotspot areas of <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloths.</b> Second, I measured characteristics of the habitat surrounding sloth presence and absence sites at the local scale (tree height, canopy cover, basal area) and at three broader scales (patch area, shape, degree of isolation) using ArcMap 10. 2 and FRAGSTATS 4. 2. At the local scale, results indicated that sloths {{were more likely to be}} present in structurally complex habitats, specifically areas that were heterogeneous in tree height and basal area. Even within a given habitat type, sloths preferred more complex areas over homogenous areas. At the broader scale, sloths appeared to prefer habitats that encompassed high proportions of secondary forest and those that were nearby large tracts of forest (? 10 ha). The <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloths</b> in this study seemed to be able to adapt to the disturbed and fragmented environment by utilizing countryside habitats, specifically riparian forests, tree plantations and mixed-use areas. While there is no substitute for the resources and ecosystem services provided by forests, the management of countryside habitats should also be a priority because of their potential to conserve <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloths,</b> and other taxa throughout the Neotropics. To locally promote the use of countryside habitats by <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloths,</b> property owners should retain patches of secondary forest and incorporate more structurally complex vegetation into their lands...|$|R
50|$|The head is rounded, with a blunt {{nose and}} {{inconspicuous}} ears. As with other <b>sloths,</b> the <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> has no incisor or canine teeth, and the cheek teeth are simple and peg-like. They have no gall bladder, cecum, or appendix.|$|R
50|$|The <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> has grayish-brown to beige-color fur {{over the}} body, with darker brown fur on the throat, {{the sides of}} the face, and the forehead. The face is {{generally}} paler in color, with a stripe of very dark fur running beneath the eyes.|$|R
50|$|Large mammals {{include the}} white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Central American red brocket (Mazama temama), Yucatan brown brocket (Mazama pandora), giant {{anteater}} (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> (Bradypus variegatus), jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor), and ocelot (Leopardus pardalis).|$|R
50|$|Over {{parts of}} its range, the <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> {{overlaps}} {{the range of}} Hoffmann's two-toed sloth. Where this overlap occurs, the three-toed sloth tends to be smaller and more numerous than its relative, being more active in moving through the forest and maintaining more diurnal activity.|$|R
50|$|The {{three-toed sloths}} are tree-living mammals from South and Central America. They {{are the only}} members of the genus Bradypus and the family Bradypodidae. The four living species of three-toed <b>sloths</b> are the <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth,</b> the maned sloth, the pale-throated sloth, and the pygmy three-toed sloth.|$|R
50|$|Like other sloths, the pygmy three-toed sloth {{feeds on}} leaves. It feeds on red {{mangrove}} leaves, which are relatively poor in nutrients and coarser than the tender leaves of Cecropia species eaten by <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloths</b> on the mainland. Details of mating behavior and reproduction {{have not been}} documented.|$|R
50|$|It {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to, and often confused with, the <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth,</b> which has a much wider distribution. Genetic evidence has been interpreted to suggest the two species diverged only around 400,000 years ago, although the most recent evidence indicates the split was closer to 6 million years.|$|R
5000|$|... 149 {{species of}} mammals have been recorded, of which over 80 are bats.Mammals include red-handed howler (Alouatta belzebul), red-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas), <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> (Bradypus variegatus), Linnaeus's two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus) and nine-banded {{armadillo}} (Dasypus novemcinctus).Endangered mammals include white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus), black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis).|$|R

50|$|The park {{is named}} after the Suma√∫ma tree (Ceiba pentandra).It {{contains}} remnants of primary forest, low and high rainforest, grassland and Mauritia flexuosa palms.There are over 80 species of birds, some endemic to the palms.The park is home to various small mammals, including the threatened pied tamarin (Saguinus bicolor).Other species include the <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> (Bradypus variegatus), red-rumped agouti (Dasyprocta leporina) and green iguana (Iguana iguana).|$|R
50|$|In the wild, the {{lifespan}} {{of adult}} <b>brown-throated</b> three-toed <b>sloths</b> is typically between 30 and 40 years.|$|R
50|$|The <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> is {{the most}} {{widespread}} and common of the three-toed sloths. It is found from Honduras in the north, through Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama into Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and eastern Peru. It is probably not found north of the Amazon Rainforest or east of the Rio Negro, although its similarity to the pale-throated sloth found in these regions has led to some confusion in the past.|$|R
50|$|Studies of the <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> {{indicate}} that mating is most common between January and March {{in at least}} the northern parts of its range, but this may vary elsewhere. Gestation lasts at least seven months, and the single young is born fully furred and clawed. Young sloths cling to the mother's underside for five months or more, {{even though they are}} fully weaned after just four to five weeks.|$|R
50|$|Fauna in {{the forest}} include jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor), brocket deer (Mazama genus), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), {{collared}} peccary (Pecari tajacu), mantled howler (Alouatta palliata), black-headed spider monkey (Ateles fusciceps), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> (Bradypus variegatus), lowland paca (Cuniculus paca) and Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata).There are many reptiles and amphibians. There are about 380 species of birds in all strata of the forest, {{a very high level}} of diversity.|$|R
50|$|The {{documented}} fauna of {{the region}} includes 39 species of mammals, 377 species of birds and 126 species of reptiles and amphibians.

50|$|<b>Brown-throated</b> <b>sloths</b> sleep 15 to 18 {{hours every}} day and are active {{for only a few}} brief periods, which may be during either the day or night. Although they can walk along the ground, and even swim, they spend most of their lives in the high {{branches}} of trees, descending once every eight days or so to defecate in the soil. Adult animals are solitary, except when raising young, and males have been observed to fight one another using their fore claws.|$|R
50|$|Large mammals include silky {{anteater}} (Cyclopes didactylus), southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> (Bradypus variegatus), jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor), red brocket (Mazama americana), gray brocket (Mazama gouazoubira) and South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris).Species local to the Southwestern Amazon Moist Forests include the short-eared dog (Atelocynus microtis), Linnaeus's two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus), pygmy marmoset (Cebuella pygmaea), brown-mantled tamarin (Saguinus fuscicollis) and Goeldi's marmoset (Callimico goeldii).Endangered mammals include Peruvian spider monkey (Ateles chamek) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis).|$|R
50|$|The <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> is {{of similar}} size and build to most {{other species of}} three-toed sloths, with {{both males and females}} being 42 to 80 cm in total body length. The tail is {{relatively}} short, only 2.5 to 9 cm long. Adults weigh from 2.25 to 6.3 kg, with no significant size difference between males and females. Each foot has three fingers, ending in long, curved claws, which are 7 to 8 cm long on the fore feet, and 5 to 5.5 cm on the hind feet.|$|R
5000|$|... 338 {{species of}} birds have been identified, of which 20 are {{threatened}} to some extent, such as the white-eared parakeet (Pyrrhura leucotis).There are 51 species of mammals of which 8 are threatened.The fruit bat morcego-fruteiro-claro is vulnerable to extinction in Brazil.Threatened species include collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> (Bradypus variegatus), southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla), channel-billed toucan (Ramphastos vitellinus), rusty-margined guan (Penelope superciliaris), brown-backed parrotlet (Touit melanonotus), boa constrictor (Boa constrictor) and striped worm lizard (Ophiodes striatus).There are 43 species of fish of which 5 are endangered.|$|R
50|$|The body {{is covered}} with coarse guard hairs up to 10 cm long, with a finer undercoat. Green algae live mutualistically between the {{microscopic}} scales {{on the surface of}} the guard hairs, giving the sloth a somewhat greenish appearance that serves as camouflage. Adults are blackish-grey over most of the body, with darker patches distributed over the backs, shoulders, and hips. Males have a bright yellow or orange patch on the back, divided by a central black stripe. Pale-throated sloths are difficult to distinguish from the closely related <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth,</b> but, as their name implies, have a pale yellow patch on the throat.|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown unique {{morphological}} traits of sloths, affecting varied phenotypic traits from skeletal parts to soft tissues. Here we present the first descriptive allometric pattern of mandible form among the <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth</b> Bradypus variegatus (Schinz, 1825), based {{on the study of}} 25 specimens by means of geometric morphometric methods. The results obtained indicate that the species has a non-allometric slope, and therefore shape variation could hardly be explained by size. An established 'lever index', which can characterize the mandibular mechanical advantage, was maintained independently of the mandibular size. This non-geometric scaling of jaw form in sloth represents another uniqueness of this animal taxon...|$|R
