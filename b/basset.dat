5|$|Richard <b>Basset</b> (died between 1135 and 1144) was a royal {{judge and}} sheriff {{during the reign}} of King Henry I of England. His father was also a royal justice. In about 1122 <b>Basset</b> married the {{eventual}} heiress of another other justice; the marriage settlement has survived. In 1129–30 <b>Basset</b> was co-sheriff of eleven counties. <b>Basset</b> and his wife founded a monastic house in 1125 from their lands, which before the donation were equivalent to 15 knight's fees.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{his service}} as a sheriff, <b>Basset</b> {{also served as a}} royal justice, hearing pleas in Leicestershire in 1129 and 1130. Between 1131 and 1133, <b>Basset</b> {{appears to have been a}} {{frequent}} attendee at the royal court, as he witnessed a number of documents. He was present at the councils held at Northampton in 1131 and at Westminster in 1132. <b>Basset</b> witnessed no royal documents after 1133, when King Henry left England for Normandy for the final time.|$|E
5|$|<b>Basset</b> {{witnessed}} a royal charter in 1135 but was dead by 1144, when his lands were {{granted by the}} Empress Matilda and her son Henry to Richard's son Geoffrey Ridel. His other sons were Ralph <b>Basset,</b> who held lands near Drayton, and William <b>Basset,</b> who held lands near Sapcote. William became a royal justice and sheriff like his father. Richard also had two daughters: Sibil, who married Robert de Cauz, and Matilda, who married John de Stuteville. Ralph inherited the ancestral lands in Normandy. The Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis wrote that <b>Basset</b> built a tower on his ancestral lands of Montreuil in Normandy purely to demonstrate his status and wealth.|$|E

50|$|Both Tanner and Hearne {{speak of}} <b>Basset's</b> {{historical}} works as lying in manuscript at the College of Arms, but no distinct mention {{of them is}} made in W. H. Black's catalogue of the chief historical manuscripts which are now preserved there. William Dunn Macray is of opinion that an incomplete history of Henry V's wars in France, written in French, which {{is now in the}} College of Arms, may possibly prove to be one of <b>Basset's</b> compilations. Both Bale and Tanner distinctly state, however, that <b>Basset's</b> history of Henry V was written in English. It is probable that Hall, who was obviously acquainted with <b>Basset's</b> work, made liberal use of it in his well-known chronicle.|$|R
5|$|Ralph <b>Basset</b> (sometimes Bassett; died c. 1127) was {{a medieval}} English royal justice {{during the reign}} of King Henry I of England. He was a native of Normandy, and may have come to Henry's notice while Henry held land in Normandy prior to {{becoming}} king. <b>Basset</b> is first mentioned in documents about 1102, and from then until his death around 1127, he was frequently employed as a royal justice. His son Richard <b>Basset</b> also became a royal judge.|$|E
5|$|The first secure {{mentions}} of <b>Basset</b> are in royal charters {{dating to}} around 1102, where he {{appears as a}} witness. He then appears as a judge in a royal dispute with the sheriff of Yorkshire. <b>Basset</b> is named {{as one of the}} commissioners of the Liber Winton, a survey of the landholdings in the city of Winchester which took place at some point between 1103 and 1115, probably close to 1110. From his Norman lands, <b>Basset</b> is recorded as donating lands to the Abbey of Saint-Evroul in 1113. in 1111 <b>Basset</b> took part in the Michaelmas session of the Exchequer, and he continued to take part in financial affairs and can be considered as an early Baron of the Exchequer.|$|E
5|$|After King Henry's {{death in}} 1135, <b>Basset</b> was not {{employed}} as a royal official, either as a justice or as a sheriff. He appears once as a witness to a charter of King Stephen's in 1136, but the authenticity of this document has been questioned. He had built a castle in Normandy at Montreuil-au-Houlme, but <b>Basset</b> did not have possession of it in 1136, when it was held against Stephen's opponents by William de Montpincon.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of Jean <b>Basset's</b> {{translation of the}} Bible into Chinese on Robert Morrison's translation of the Bible into Chinese is well known. There are four groups of manuscripts for <b>Basset's</b> translation. This research will present an initial consideration of the formation process of these manuscripts, after which the connection with the Morrison translation shall be explored...|$|R
5|$|<b>Basset</b> {{probably}} died in 1127, and {{was certainly}} dead in 1130. He {{is said to}} have taken ill at Northampton, and to have been clothed in a monk's habit while on his deathbed. He was buried in the chapterhouse at Abingdon Abbey, which he left a bequest to. A copy of a charter from Archbishop Theobald of Bec, recorded in a cartulary, records most of Basset's manors. While most of the estates seem to have been held by <b>Basset</b> as a sub-tenant, four of the estates appear to have been held as a tenant-in-chief. These estates were not very valuable, and <b>Basset</b> can not be considered a baron, although his son Richard managed through marriage to {{become a member of the}} barons. He held lands in nine counties, perhaps centred in Berkshire.|$|E
5|$|Basset's lands did {{not form}} a compact estate, {{as they were}} spread over 11 counties. In 1135, Basset's lands totalled 184.25 carucates of land, and were later {{considered}} 15 knight's fees. In Leicestershire, <b>Basset</b> held most of the lands held by Robert de Buci {{at the time of}} the Domesday Survey of 1086. The lands were held by <b>Basset</b> of the king by right of his wife, but how the lands had passed into her family is unclear. In addition, <b>Basset</b> held land in Leicestershire from both King David I of Scotland and from Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester.|$|E
5|$|Basset's {{rewards for}} his royal service {{included}} {{a number of}} manors. <b>Basset</b> was granted the manor of Mixbury by the king, after the family that held {{it at the time}} of Domesday Book died out and it escheated to the king. Other lands held by <b>Basset</b> were probably royal rewards also. One was Quiddenham, which had been held in 1086 by crown. Another was Stoney Stanton, originally held in 1086 by Robert Despenser.|$|E
50|$|Before 1532 however John <b>Basset's</b> {{wardship}} {{and marriage}} had been purchased by his step-father Lord Lisle who wishing to provide her a wealthy husband, married {{him off to}} his daughter, thus <b>Basset's</b> step-sister, Frances Plantagenet. In 1533 Lord Lisle was appointed Lord Deputy of Calais and moved there with Lady Lisle, John's mother, leaving John at Lord Lisle's manor of Soberton in Hampshire from 1533 to 1535.|$|R

5|$|In 1129–30, <b>Basset</b> {{served as}} sheriff of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Norfolk and Suffolk, and Surrey {{together}} with Aubrey de Vere II. The number of shrievalties was unusual, {{and is known}} from the Pipe Roll of 1130. According to the entries in the Pipe Roll, de Vere and <b>Basset</b> did not function as traditional sheriffs, farming the revenues, but were instead responsible for the entire royal revenue in those counties.|$|E
5|$|Most alto {{and bass}} {{clarinets}} {{have an extra}} key to allow a (written) E3. Modern professional-quality bass clarinets generally have additional keywork to written C3. Among the less commonly encountered members of the clarinet family, contra-alto and contrabass clarinets may have keywork to written E3, D3, or C3; the <b>basset</b> clarinet and <b>basset</b> horn generally go to low C3.|$|E
5|$|<b>Basset</b> was {{a native}} of Montreuil-au-Houlme near Domfront in Normandy, and {{possibly}} came to the notice of King Henry while Henry was count of Domfort during the reign of Henry's older brother King William II of England (1087–1100). Either <b>Basset</b> himself or an earlier person with the same name held lands of Robert d'Oilly that were recorded in Domesday Book as in Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire. If the Ralph in Domesday was {{not the same as the}} judge, the Domesday Ralph may have been the judge's father. Other Bassets in the area were also recorded in Domesday, including a Wiliam and a Richard. It is not clear how or if they were related to Ralph. Ralph the judge held lands in Montreuil that in 1150 were considered to be worth two English manors. He held lands in Wallingford and Colston <b>Basset.</b> The lands in Wallingford were worth 16 and a third knight's fees.|$|E
