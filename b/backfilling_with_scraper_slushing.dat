50|$|Roads were {{provided}} and maintained through a committee formed in 1907 by Local Improvement District 15.B.3 around Hanley. The early challenges were the hilly area and creek to the east. Early prairie roads were trails which became so rutted {{that they could}} barely be crossed over. To make roads out of these trails horse drawn blade graders were used to level out hummocks and fill badger holes. Horse drawn <b>slush</b> <b>scrapers</b> filled in sloughs. More advanced fresno <b>scrapers</b> replaced the <b>slush</b> <b>scrapers</b> as they could make longer and wider swaths across the sloughs. By ploughing the prairie soil at the road allowance, and then using road graders to pull in the dirt roads could be made wide enough for the first cars of the area. The rural municipality of Rosedale No. 283 was incorporated December 13, 1909.|$|R
40|$|A {{developmental}} miniature mercury-ion clock has stability {{comparable to}} that of a hydrogen-maser clock. The ion-handling components are housed in a sealed vacuum tube, wherein a getter pump is used to maintain the partial vacuum, and the evacuated tube is <b>backfilled</b> <b>with</b> mercury vapor in a buffer gas. Neon was determined to be the best choice for the buffer gas: The pressure-induced frequency pulling by neon was found to be only about two-fifths of that of helium. Furthermore, because neon diffuses through solids much more slowly than does helium, the operational lifetime of a tube <b>backfilled</b> <b>with</b> neon could be considerably longer than that of a tube <b>backfilled</b> <b>with</b> helium...|$|R

50|$|For {{underground}} mines, rehabilitation is {{not always}} a significant problem or cost. This is because of the higher grade of the ore and lower volumes of waste rock and tailings.

40|$|In this paper, an {{analytical}} expression is derived {{for the total}} dynamic active force from the c- soil <b>backfill</b> <b>with</b> surcharge under seismic loading conditions. The special cases of this new expression result in the expressions given by earlier researchers for different field situations of soil <b>backfills</b> <b>with</b> and without seismic loadings. A graphical presentation is made to {{recognize the importance of}} angle of shearing resistance and cohesion of the soil backfill, surcharge and direction of vertical seismic loadings. As expected, this shows that the total dynamic active force decreases with an increase in the angle of shearing resistance of the soil backfill. Also, for any value of angle of shearing resistance, the presence of cohesion in the backfill decreases the active force, however, the surcharge load increases the active force significantly whether the seismic load acts or not. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the steps for calculation of total dynamic active force...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFluent {{software}} {{was used to}} simulate the heat transfer performance of the U-tube heat exchangers <b>with</b> <b>backfill</b> materials of shape-stabilized phase change materials (PCMs) and crushed stone concrete in this paper. The shape-stabilized PCMs refer to a mixture of decanoic acid and lauric acid that the mass concentration of decanoic acid is 60 % with 10 % silica and 6 % expanded graphite. It makes the shape-stabilized PCM has the {{coefficient of thermal conductivity}} of 1. 528 W/(m•K) and the latent heat of 109. 2 kJ/kg. After the simulation of the time for 12 hours, the heat exchange for unit borehole depth of <b>backfilling</b> <b>with</b> shape-stabilized PCM is 1. 23 times of the heat exchange for unit borehole depth of <b>backfilling</b> <b>with</b> crushed stone concrete. And the influence radius of backfill materials of shape-stabilized PCM is 0. 9 times of the influence radius of backfill materials of crushed stone concrete. So under same area of buried pipes region the shape-stabilized PCM backfill can get heat exchange is 1. 37 times of crushed stone concrete backfill. In addition, the heat conductivity coefficient of PCMs has great influence on heat pump coefficient...|$|R
