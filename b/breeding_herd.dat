Hoofed mammals at the Denver zoo (counter-clockwise from the entrance) include Grevy's zebras, reticulated giraffes, Bactrian and dromedary camels, okapi, Somali wild ass, many species of antelope including bongo and gerenuk as well as Cape buffalo. Denver Zoo is also one of only a few zoos in the world to house a <b>breeding</b> <b>herd</b> of Przewalski's horses. Other species exhibited in the hoofed mammal yards include red kangaroos and emus in an Australian habitat, abyssinian ground hornbills with the gerenuk and secretary birds exhibited with the okapi.|$|E

The most famous of these was Jubilee (1977–2003), so named as {{he was born in}} 1977, the year of the Queen's Silver Jubilee. The zoo has a <b>breeding</b> <b>herd</b> of eight elephants, composed of two males and six females– the breeding male Aung-Bo, ageing female Maya, Thi Hi Way, her daughters Sithami Hi Way and Nandita Hi Way and Sithami's son, Aayu Hi Way who was born in January 2017 and daughter Sundara Hi Way and her daughter Indali Hi Way who was born in December 2016. The elephant house also used to house African elephants, rhinos, hippos and tapirs. Motty, a hybrid African-Asian elephant calf was born in July 1978, but died in infancy.|$|E

500|$|From {{very early}} in her career, Bowling wrote about educating horse breeders on genetic {{diseases}} in purebred animals and {{how to deal with}} these conditions. She performed a number of studies on the Arabian horse breed, including research into one of the genetic diseases that affects Arabians, cerebellar abiotrophy (CA). In 1985, she created a <b>breeding</b> <b>herd</b> at UCD of horses known to carry CA, and this small group provided preliminary DNA data for researchers. Bowling's own studies of CA were unpublished {{at the time of her}} death, but she is credited with demonstrating that the condition had a recessive mode of genetic inheritance and was likely the result of a single mutated allele. [...] A DNA marker test for the condition was developed by her successors at UCD, which became available to the public in 2008. In 2011, the causative mutation for cerebellar abiotrophy was identified, and the condition was conclusively established as an autosomal recessive.|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, the zoo's first director, William T. Hornaday, {{along with}} President Theodore Roosevelt and other conservationalists, created the American Bison Society (ABS) {{in an attempt}} to save the American bison from extinction. The bison had been {{depleted}} from tens-of-millions of animals to only a few hundred {{by the end of the}} 19th century due to westward expansion. The society worked to breed the species in captivity as well as raise public awareness, raise money to create protected reserves, and reintroduce bison back into the wild. On October 11, 1907, the first reintroduction of bison began when the zoo sent six males and nine females, by rail, to the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge in Oklahoma. Seven days later, the animals were successfully reintroduced to the park. By 1935, the society, who had successfully carried out several more reintroductions from bison kept in zoos and ranches, considered their work done and disbanded that year. In 2005, the Wildlife Conservation Society resurrected and re-purposed the ABS to, [...] "help build the social and scientific foundations for the ecological restoration of bison," [...] and, [...] "restore bison ecologically, not just animals in pens but actual functioning animals in the larger landscape," [...] (Keith Aune, WCS Bison Coordinator). According to a study published in 2012, virtually all wild and captive bison in the United States are hybrids with cattle genes, with the exception of the two distinct breeding populations within Yellowstone National Park and their descendants. The cattle genes entered the bison population due to private ranchers hybridizing their bison to make them more docile, with some of these animals being accidentally reintroduced by the ABS. In response, in the fall of 2011, the WCS arranged for a herd of female bison originating from the American Prairie Reserve to be sent to the Colorado State University's Animal Reproduction & Biotechnology Laboratory to be used as surrogates {{in an attempt to}} transfer the fertilized embryos of genetically pure bison. After an ultrasound showed one female to be pregnant, the herd was moved to the zoo where, on June 20, 2012, the calf was born. The herd is kept in an off-exhibit section of the zoo and the goal is to eventually create a <b>breeding</b> <b>herd</b> of genetically pure bison through embryo transfers with the surrogate hybrid bison.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Reproductive {{performance}} {{is a key}} driver of the economics of dairy and beef <b>breeding</b> <b>herds.</b> In the absence of hormonal treatment to induce or stimulate lactation, regular parturition and initiation of lactation are key events directly affecting the average daily milk production of dairy herds, culling decisions and farm gross margins. Thus efficient reproductive management is a critical prerequisite for sustainable dairy production. Economic modelling {{of the performance of}} both southern and northern Australian beef cattle breeding enterprises has demonstrated that cows which recommence cycling and readily conceive in response to the annual seasonal improvement in pasture quality and quantity return the greatest gross margin per hectare. The major factors affecting the weaning rate in beef <b>breeding</b> <b>herds</b> are interval after calving to resumption of normal ovulations, embryo-foetal survival and perinatal survival...|$|R

The annual culling rate for the 84 farms averaged 59. 4 % ± 6. 4 (SEM). The correlation coefficient between boar and sow culling was 0. 52 (p < 0. 0001). Removal was the result of being overweight (47 %), reproductive problems (18 %), leg problems (12 %), death (7 %), and other diseases (4 %). From the annual culling rate, the average breeding life of boars was estimated at 20 months. From this study, we concluded that the annual culling rate for boars in commercial herds was high and related to several different factors...|$|R

40|$|In predator-free large {{herbivore}} populations, where density-dependent feedbacks {{occur at}} the limit where forage resources can no longer support the population, environmental catastrophes may {{play a significant role}} in population regulation. The potential role of fire as a stochastic mass-mortality event limiting these populations is poorly understood, so too the behavioural and physiological responses of the affected animals to this type of large disturbance event. During September 2005, a wildfire resulted in mortality of 29 (18 % population mortality) and injury to 18, African elephants in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa. We examined movement and herd association patterns of six GPS-collared <b>breeding</b> <b>herds,</b> and evaluated population physiological response through faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (stress) levels. We investigated population size, structure and projected growth rates using a simulation model. After an initial flight response post-fire, severely injured <b>breeding</b> <b>herds</b> reduced daily displacement with increased daily variability, reduced home range size, spent more time in non-tourist areas and associated less with other herds. Uninjured, or less severely injured, <b>breeding</b> <b>herds</b> also shifted into non-tourist areas post-fire, but in contrast, increased displacement rate (both mean and variability), did not adjust home range size and formed larger herds post-fire.
