At the end of the film, the announcer says that there would be two sequels: Machete Kills and Machete Kills Again. Soon afterward, Rodriguez confirmed that the financing for the sequels was in place, and that once everyone was free, they could begin shooting.|$|E

5|$|Early {{forecasts}} remarked {{the potential}} to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> threat to Hawaii than Pauline because Rick was further south than Pauline and thus less likely to weaken since Rick was over of warmer sea surface temperatures than Pauline.

While the surf did rise somewhat, the waves were {{significantly lower than the}} heights experienced during Pauline. The U.S. Coast Guard received a report of an overdue sailing vessel en route to the Hawaiian Island group. However, it is unknown if Pauline or Rick affected the boat's course.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, the Giant Schnauzer {{is used as}} {{a police}} dog; is trained for obedience, dog agility, herding, search and rescue, and schutzhund; and is shown in {{conformation}} shows. They are also used for carting. In Europe, the breed is considered to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> working dog than a show dog. The focus in many European Schnauzer clubs is not so much on conformation shows, but on the working ability of the breed. In several countries, including Germany, dogs must achieve a Schutzhund Champion title before they can qualify to be a conformation champion.|$|E
5|$|The {{police force}} {{comprised}} around 200 {{men at the}} start, and Gens appointed Salk Dessler as his deputy commandant. Other chief subordinates included Joseph Muszkat and Meir Levas. Dessler was a Revisionist Zionist, and Muszkat and Levas had been members of the Betar, the youth movement of the Revisionist Zionists. The police force included many other former Betar members, and {{this may have been}} because Gens favored people coming from his own political leanings. This led to a conflict with the Bund, another Jewish political group. The Bund appears to have wanted the police force to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> militia, with Gens and his supporters wishing it to be a more conventional police force. After some initial political wrangling, Gens' faction won, but the Bundists remained strong in the Judenrat.|$|E

The majority of the original townsite was consumed by the excavation of the Lavender Pit mine during the 1950s.

25|$|Despite these problems, one of {{the main}} {{achievements}} of Attlee's government was the maintenance of near full employment. The government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation of materials and manpower, and unemployment rarely rose above 500,000, or 3% of the total workforce. In fact labour shortages proved to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> problem. One area where the government was not quite as successful was in housing, which was also the responsibility of Aneurin Bevan. The government had a target to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built.|$|E

According to Kessler's book, in the summer of 1999, Woodward showed up unexpectedly at the home of Felt's daughter and took him to lunch. Joan Felt, who was taking care of him at her home, told Kessler her father greeted Woodward like an old friend, and their mysterious meeting appeared to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> celebration than an interview.|$|E
25|$|The {{trousers}} worn by Indiana Jones in {{all three}} films were based on original World War II Army and Army Air Corps officer trousers. Although not original Pinks {{they are based on}} the same basic design and do carry a slight pinkish hue. The trousers made for Raiders are said to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> greyish-brown whereas the trousers made for Temple of Doom and Last Crusade were supposedly a purer reddish brown. The trousers were made of a khaki wool-twill, pleated with seven belt loops, two scalloped button flap rear pockets, a button fly and a four-inch military style hem. They were all most likely subcontracted by the costume department and made by famed London based cinema costumers, Angels and Bermans, to be tailored perfectly for Harrison Ford for the production.|$|E
25|$|The 1st Independent Company {{was formed}} in May/June 1941 and was trained at the No. 7 Infantry Training Centre at Tidal River on Wilsons Promontory in Victoria. Originally the company was raised {{to serve in the}} Middle East although, at that time there was {{uncertainty}} about the role that the company would fill there. Indeed, within the Australian Army there was a section that saw no need for the independent companies, believing that they would prove to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> drain on resources than anything else. However, later in 1941, as the threat of war with Imperial Japan loomed, {{the main body of the}} company was sent to Kavieng, New Ireland, to protect Kavieng airfield whilst other sections were sent to Namatanai on New Ireland, Vila in the New Hebrides, Tulagi on Guadalcanal, Buka on Bougainville, and Lorengau on Manus Island to act as observers and provided medical treatment to the inhabitants.|$|E

25|$|With the new ball due six overs {{into the}} fourth day Sri Lankan wickets fell thick and fast, half the team falling before lunch, the last of which being opener Michael Vandort who {{narrowly}} missed out on being the fifth batsmen ever to hold his wicket throughout an entire innings. England took to the crease just before lunch with a very slow run rate that came only from Strauss - Trescothick fell after nine runs, none of them contributed by him. The third man, Alastair Cook held out {{for the rest of}} the innings though achieving 34 not out; during this time Strauss fell to a controversial catch, replays showed it popped off his pads. Pietersen, wanting to end the Test quickly, took the wicket with his usual speed, taking 13 runs off 25 balls his confidence assured by a catch by the tourists' skipper to be called a no ball, and a further two no balls which he took boundaries off. However, his cockiness proved his downfall as he lashed out at a ball from Murali, the only bowler to take wickets in the second innings, and was caught plumb. Collingwood soon fell for 3 and it seemed as if the easy target of 78 was going to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> struggle but Cook, remaining from the second partnership, took two runs and two byes and skipper Flintoff, who done nothing with his first three balls, drove Murali down the ground to long on for four on his fourth ball to win the match, and his third in a row as English skipper.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{signing with}} Arsenal, club manager Wenger likened the player to former club player Patrick Vieira. Wenger {{compared}} the two {{primarily because of}} the similarities between each player's physical appearance and positional preference. While the two are similar in appearance, Diaby has admitted that there are huge differences, stating, [...] "I think maybe I <b>am</b> <b>more</b> attack-minded, a more technical player," [...] and, [...] "Vieira <b>is</b> much <b>more</b> aggressive. He makes <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> physical impact in a game, in midfield. He is amazing. I don’t think I have this quality yet. I think I can develop in that way but he is much stronger." [...] In 2009, Wenger echoed Diaby's sentiments, stating, [...] "I believe Vieira <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> passer <b>of</b> the ball. Diaby <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dribbler, <b>more</b> offensive and makes more penetrating runs. Vieira <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> constructor.
