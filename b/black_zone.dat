50|$|Kretzschmaria deusta, {{commonly}} known as brittle cinder, is a fungus and plant pathogen found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is common {{on a wide range}} of broadleaved trees including beech (Fagus), oak (Quercus), lime (Tilia), and maple (Acer). It causes a soft rot, breaking down both cellulose and lignin, and decays the trunk and/or roots of living trees. The fungus continues to decay wood after the host tree has died, making K. deusta a facultative parasite. The resulting brittle fracture has a ceramic-like fracture surface. <b>Black</b> <b>zone</b> lines can be seen in cross-sections of wood infected with K. deusta.|$|E

50|$|Aspen {{trunk rot}} affects only living aspen and {{occasionally}} {{a variety of}} poplar trees. Trembling Aspen Populus tremuloides and Large-tooth Aspen Populus grandidentata are two major hosts of trunk rot. In all infected species, the most obvious sign of rot is a conk on the stem of the tree. A conk is the woody fruiting body of the fungus that forms a triangular shape. Conks are perennial and can survive for up to twenty years. They form about {{five years after the}} initial infection. As the decay progresses, rot within the heartwood occurs. The rot appears as a yellowish-white spongy material with <b>black</b> <b>zone</b> lines surrounding it. The main body of rot occurs in the trunk and stem but basal rot can occur as well. The decayed wood has a distinct wintergreen aroma that signifies trunk rot. At the initial stages, the decay may appear discolored but continue to be hard and firm while at later stages, the rot may becomes brownish and the tree may lose structural strength and snap due to a wind gust or other damaging factor. Aspen trunk rot affects older (50-60 years) trees more than younger trees. Older trees tend to have more wounds and damage. Phellinus tremulae can maintain a resting state for 20 years, so older trees have a greater chance of being infected. Older trees become diseased and die more quickly than younger trees. Stem wounds also increase the opportunities for infection no matter the age of the tree. In order to diagnose aspen trunk rot, conks are the first sign to look for. Perennial conks with concentric growth rings indicate severe decay because each growth ring signifies a season of disease. It takes many years to build up the concentric rings to indicate severe decay. The conks can appear to have a triangular shape and the lower surface is covered in pores. Knots and stem wounds/scars also indicate decay within the aspen tree while cavities and cracks display the inner decay. Aspen trunk rot is a white rotter because the lignin is broken down within the tree, giving the diseased trunk a white appearance.|$|E

The strength of this approach lies within the identification of relevant variables that make a strong contribution towards a better understanding of accident circumstances and the discerning of descriptive accident patterns from more discriminating accident circumstances to profile black spots and <b>black</b> <b>zones.</b> The use of this data mining algorithm is particularly useful in the context of large datasets on road accidents, since data mining can be described as the extraction of information from large amounts of data.

The mineralization lies within {{the upper part of}} the locally defi ned Gap Well Formation, and in the lower part of the overlying West Creek Formation. These units correlate respectively with the Irregully and lower Kiangi Creek Formations of the Edmund Group. The Abra deposit is characterized by a funnel-shaped brecciated zone, interpreted as a breccia feeder-pipe, overlain by stratabound mineralization made up of the Red Zone, an underlying <b>Black</b> <b>Zone,</b> and a stringer (feeder) zone. The Red Zone is characterized by banded jaspilite, hematite, galena, pyrite, quartz, abundant barite, and siderite. The <b>Black</b> <b>Zone</b> consists of veins and rhythmically banded Pb, Zn, and minor Cu sulfi des, laminated and/or brecciated hematite, magnetite, Fe-rich carbonate, barite, and scheelite. In situ Sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) U–Pb geochronology of detrital zircon, monazite, and xenotime in sandstones from the Abra deposit yields a range of dates from c. 2450 Ma to c. 1675 Ma, consistent with results from previous detrital zircon studies. SHRIMP dating of hydrothermal monazite from the Abra deposit suggests that a mineralization event occurred at c. 1385 Ma. The presence of c. 1465 Ma metamorphic/hydrothermal monazite in sandstones from Abra indicates that the host rocks are older and therefore belong to the Edmund Group. SHRIMP geochronology of xenotime extracted from the Tangadee Rhyolite, which outcrops within the lower Kiangi Creek Formation close to the Abra deposit, yields two main age components corresponding to oscillatory-zoned cores and unzoned rims. The cores are interpreted as magmatic in origin and indicate a possible eruption age of c. 1235 Ma, whereas the rims are interpreted to record a later hydrothermal event at c. 1030 Ma.

50|$|Aspen {{trunk rot}} is a fungal disease that causes stem decay heart rot of living aspen trees. The {{pathogen}} that causes this disease is the fungus Phellinus tremulae. Most {{of the symptoms}} of this disease are internal, with the only external signs of a diseased aspen being fruiting bodies called conks. A single conk found on an aspen can indicate advanced decay of up 82% of the tree volume. Internal decayed wood of freshly cut aspens is spongy, yellow/white colored, surrounded by <b>black</b> <b>zones</b> of discoloration, and contains a distinct wintergreen smell. The fungus is spread via airborne spores released from the fruiting body which can infect through dead branches, branch stubs, or wounds in the tree. Although no direct management control is known, harvesting aspen stands that have been damaged or harvesting stands before decay becomes advanced minimizes tree loss. Aspen wood is white, malleable but strong, and heat tolerant and therefore has many commercial uses including matches, packing paper, lumber, plywood, pulp, and animal beds. Aspen trees diseased with aspen trunk rot decrease the economic value of the lumber.|$|R
40|$|Xynthia was {{a violent}} {{windstorm}} which crossed Western Europe in 2010. Its transit caused {{the death of}} 59 people in Europe. France was the hardest country hit by Xynthia: 47 people were killed, most of them from drowning, and direct losses amounted to more than 2. 5 billion Euros. Strong gusts and waves of several meters of height, associated to high coefficient tides, caused a phenomenon of storm surge in the Atlantic coastal area of France, particularly in the Vendée and Charente-Maritime departments. Sea walls, lacking of maintenance and originally built to defend agricultural land, {{were not able to}} protect houses. Around 10, 000 people were forced to evacuate after the inundation of their properties. Essentially, a restrictive construction policy is supposed to be applied to these areas. In actual practice, mayors are sometimes not able to resist the pressure of property developers and, since 1999, about 100, 000 houses have been built in flood prone areas all over France. During the storm, uncontrolled urbanization was involved in the increase of stakes, as demonstrated by the fact that all the 29 victims in the city of la Faute-sur-Mer were living in houses built after 1980. There is also a very clear link between the type of building and mortality due to marine submersion: three-quarters of the victims died in houses without a second floor, where water reached heights over the ceiling elevation. After Xynthia transit, the government decided to destroy 1510 houses in the affected areas (called <b>black</b> <b>zones).</b> Most of the occupants did not agree with this decision, demanding further investigation, and eventually the government had to gradually revoke the policy for the <b>black</b> <b>zones.</b> We affirm that an attentive governance should include a balanced approach to risk protection, combining the reduction of natural hazard with broader measures of land management, to contemporary diminish vulnerability (e. g. by changing housing standards and building physical protections) and exposure (e. g. by zoning policies). Risk management includes a multitude of actors (national government, local authorities, communities) having different spatial scale and roles, and the difficulties relate to agents myopia, moral hazard problems, and conflicting interests. Moreover real estate market does not appropriately consider risk.
