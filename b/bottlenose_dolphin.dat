5|$|In coastal regions, {{dolphins}} run {{the risk}} of colliding with boats. Researchers of the <b>Bottlenose</b> <b>Dolphin</b> Research Institute first quantified data about solitary <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> diving behavior in the presence and absence of boats. Dolphins responded more to tourist than fishing vessels. Driving behavior, speed, engine type and separation distance all affect dolphin safety.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{studied by}} <b>Bottlenose</b> <b>Dolphin</b> Research Institute researchers {{off the island}} of Sardinia show random social behavior while feeding, and their social behavior {{does not depend on}} feeding activity. In Sardinia, the presence of a floating marine fin-fish farm has been linked to a change in <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> distribution as a result of high fish density around the floating cages in the farming area.|$|E

5|$|On the Penghu Islands in Taiwan, drive fishing of <b>Bottlenose</b> <b>Dolphins</b> was {{practice}}d until 1990, {{when the}} practice was outlawed by the government. Mainly Indian Ocean <b>Bottlenose</b> <b>Dolphins</b> but also common <b>Bottlenose</b> <b>Dolphins</b> were captured in these hunts.|$|R
50|$|Indo-Pacific <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{are very}} similar to common <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> in appearance. Common <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> have a {{reasonably}} strong body, moderate-length beak, and tall, curved dorsal fins; whereas Indo-Pacific <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> have a more slender body build and their beak is longer and more slender. The Indo-Pacific population also tends to have a somewhat lighter blue colour and the cape is generally more distinct, with a light spinal blaze extending to below the dorsal fin. However, although not always present, the most obvious distinction can be made with the presence of black spots or flecks on the bellies of adults of Indo-Pacific <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins,</b> which are very rare in common <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins.</b> Their teeth can number between 23 and 29 in each upper and lower jaw, and are more slender than those of common <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins.</b> Size of Indo-Pacific <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> can vary based on geographic location; however, its average length is 2.6 m long, and it weighs up to 230 kg. The length at birth is between 0.84 and 1.5 m.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> are {{the most}} common captive {{cetaceans}} on a global scale. Prior to 1980, more than 1,500 <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> were collected from the United States, Mexico, and the Bahamas, and more than 550 common and 60 Indo-Pacific <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> were brought into captivity in Japan. By the late 1980s, the United States stopped collecting <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> and the number of captive-born animals in North American aquariums has increased from only 6% in 1976 to about 44% in 1996.|$|R
5|$|Bottlenose dolphins, {{the genus}} Tursiops, {{are the most}} common members of the family Delphinidae, the family of oceanic dolphin. Recent {{molecular}} studies show the genus contains two species, the common <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Tursiops truncatus) and the Indo-Pacific <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Tursiops aduncus), instead of one. Research in 2011 revealed a third species, the Burrunan dolphin (Tursiops australis). Bottlenose dolphins inhabit warm and temperate seas worldwide. They live in all oceans except for the Arctic and Antarctic Circle regions.|$|E
5|$|Nellie, the longest-lived Atlantic <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> {{in human}} care, {{died at age}} 61 on April 30th 2014. Nellie was born on Feb, 27, 1953 at Marineland.|$|E
5|$|The two {{ecotypes}} of {{the common}} <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> within the western North Atlantic are represented by the shallower water or coastal ecotype and the more offshore ecotype. Their ranges overlap, {{but they have been}} shown to be genetically distinct. They are not currently described, however, as separate species or subspecies. In general, genetic variation between populations is significant, even among nearby populations. As a result of this genetic variation, other distinct species currently considered to be populations of common <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> are possible.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{conflict}} with small-scale coastal commercial fisheries in some Mediterranean areas. Common <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> are probably attracted to fishing nets because {{they offer a}} concentrated food source.|$|R
5000|$|North Kessock is {{a famous}} spot for {{watching}} <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins,</b> which are resident in the Moray Firth - indeed {{they are the}} most northerly group of <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> in the world.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> and {{porpoises}} {{can often}} be seen swimming in the bay, as can grey seals from the neighbouring Cardigan Island colony. Cardigan Bay has a resident population of over 100 <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> (some estimates exceed 200), which are most frequently seen off southern Ceredigion between Gwbert and Aberaeron. (This is Europe's largest resident population of <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins,</b> the UK's only other one being in the Moray Firth, Scotland.) ...|$|R
5|$|Scientists {{were long}} aware that Tursiops {{dolphins}} might consist {{of more than}} one species. Molecular genetics allowed much greater insight into this previously intractable problem. The IUCN acknowledges two species, although a third distinct species was described in 2011: the common <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> (T. truncatus) is found in most tropical to temperate oceans, and it has a grey color, with the shade of grey varying among populations, but it can be bluish-grey, brownish-grey, or even nearly black, and is often darker on the back from the rostrum to behind the dorsal fin; the Black Sea <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> (T. t. ponticus), a subspecies of T. truncatus lives in the Black Sea; The Pacific <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> (T. gillii or T. t. gillii), another subspecies of T. truncatus, lives in the Pacific, and has a black line from the eye to the forehead; the Indo-Pacific <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> (T. aduncus) lives in the waters around India, northern Australia, South China, the Red Sea, and the eastern coast of Africa, with the back being dark-grey and the belly being lighter grey or nearly white with grey spots; the Burrunan dolphin (T. australis), found in the Port Phillip and Gippsland Lakes areas of Victoria, Australia, was described in September 2011 after research showed it was distinct from T. truncatus and T. aduncus, but is not considered a separate species by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|Some large shark species, such as {{the tiger}} shark, the dusky shark, the great white shark and the bull shark, prey on the <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin,</b> {{especially}} calves. The <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> is capable of defending itself by charging the predator; dolphin 'mobbing' behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark. Targeting a single adult dolphin can be dangerous for a shark of similar size. Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on bottlenose dolphins, but this seems rare, and other orcas may swim with dolphins. Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better defend themselves against predators. Bottlenose dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to outswim their predators, or mobbing techniques to batter the predator to death or force it to flee.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> has {{a single}} {{blowhole}} located on the dorsal surface of the head consisting of a hole and a muscular flap. The flap is closed during muscle relaxation and opens during contraction. Dolphins are voluntary breathers, who must deliberately surface and open their blowholes to get air. They can store almost twice as much oxygen in proportion to their body weight as a human can: the dolphin can store 36 milliliters (ml) of oxygen per kg of body weight, compared with 20 ml per kg for humans. This is an adaptation to diving. The <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> typically rises to the surface to breathe through its blowhole {{two to three times}} per minute, although it can remain submerged for up to 20 minutes.|$|E
50|$|A small {{population}} of <b>Bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins,</b> also migrate into the lagoon from the sea.

5|$|Sperm {{whales are}} not known for forging bonds with other species, but it was {{observed}} that a <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> with spinal deformity had been accepted into a pod of sperm whales. They are known to swim alongside other cetaceans such as humpback, fin, minke, pilot, and orca whales on occasion.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> {{sometimes}} forms {{mixed species}} groups with other species from the dolphin family, particularly larger species, {{such as the}} short-finned pilot whale, the false killer whale and Risso's dolphin. They also interact with smaller species, such as the Atlantic spotted dolphin and the rough-toothed dolphin. While interactions with smaller species are sometimes affiliative, {{they can also be}} hostile.|$|E
5|$|Tião was a {{well-known}} solitary female <b>Bottlenose</b> <b>Dolphin</b> that was first spotted {{in the town}} of São Sebastião in Brazil around 1994 and frequently allowed humans to interact with her. The dolphin became infamous for killing a swimmer and injuring many others, which later earned her the nickname killer dolphin.|$|E
50|$|Off {{the south}} coast of Ireland, {{humpback}} whales and fin whales are regularly seen on organized whale watching trips between July and February. Species seen all year include minke whales, common <b>dolphins,</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins,</b> Risso's dolphins, Orcas and harbour porpoises. There {{is also a}} resident group of <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> in the Shannon Estuary which attracts tourists all year round.|$|R

5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{can live}} {{for more than}} 40 years. Females typically live 5-10 years longer than males, with some females exceeding 60 years. This extreme age is rare and less than 2% of all Bottlenose dolphins will live longer than 60 years. <b>Bottlenose</b> <b>Dolphin</b> can jump at a height of 6 meters (20 feet) up in the air; they use this to communicate with one another.|$|E
5|$|Other animals, {{including}} {{whales and}} elephants have larger brains than humans. However, when the brain-to-body mass ratio is taken into account, {{the human brain}} is almost {{twice as large as}} that of a <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin,</b> and three times as large as that of a chimpanzee. However, a high ratio does not of itself demonstrate intelligence: very small animals have high ratios and the treeshrew has the largest quotient of any mammal.|$|E
5|$|Other {{television}} appearances by bottlenose dolphins include Wonder Woman, Highway to Heaven, Dolphin Cove, seaQuest DSV, and The Penguins of Madagascar, {{in which}} a dolphin, Doctor Blowhole, is a villain. In the HBO movie Zeus and Roxanne, a female <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> befriends a male dog, and in Bermuda Triangle, a girl named Annie (played by Lisa Jakub) swims with dolphins. Human and dolphin interaction segments shot on location in the Florida Keys with Dolphin Research Center as seen on a Halloween episode of The Simpsons, Treehouse of Horror XI.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums is the <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin,</b> {{as it is}} {{relatively}} easy to train and has a long lifespan in captivity. While trade in dolphins is internationally regulated, other aspects of keeping dolphins in captivity, such as the minimum size and characteristics of pools, vary among countries. Though animal welfare is perceived to have improved significantly over the last few decades, many animal rights groups still consider keeping dolphins captive to be a form of animal abuse.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{have been}} known to hybridize with other dolphin species. Hybrids with Risso's dolphin occur both in the wild and in captivity. The best known is the wolphin, a false killer whale-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wolphin is fertile, and two currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii. The first was born in 1985 to a female bottlenose. Wolphins also exist in the wild. In captivity, a <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> and a rough-toothed dolphin hybridized. A common dolphin-bottlenose dolphin hybrid born in captivity lives at SeaWorld California. Other hybrids live in captivity around the world and in the wild, such as a bottlenose dolphin-Atlantic spotted dolphin hybrid.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{investigations}} of <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphin</b> intelligence have been conducted, examining mimicry, use of artificial language, object categorization, and self-recognition. They can use tools (sponging) and transmit cultural knowledge across generations, and their considerable intelligence has driven interaction with humans. Bottlenose dolphins gained popularity from aquarium shows and television {{programs such as}} Flipper. They have also been trained by militaries to locate sea mines or detect and mark enemy divers. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape. Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins: people hunt them for food, and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a bycatch of tuna fishing and by getting caught in crab traps.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} species of {{dolphins}} at SeaWorld San Diego: common dolphin hybrid, both Atlantic and Pacific <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> and Pacific short-finned pilot whales. The <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> may rotate between Dolphin Amphitheater, Dolphin Point, and Animal Care. There are two Pacific short-finned pilot whales that live at Dolphin Amphitheater.|$|R
500|$|<b>Bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> have {{appeared}} in novels. In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy {{and one of its}} sequels, So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish, the dolphins try to warn humans of Earth's impending destruction, but their behavior was misinterpreted as playful acrobatics. <b>Bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> are central to David Brin's series of Uplift Universe novels, particularly Startide Rising, where they are one of the four Earth species (along with chimpanzees, gorillas, and dogs) to have been 'uplifted' to sentience. <b>Bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> are primary characters in Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series, especially The <b>Dolphins</b> of Pern. <b>Bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> are incorporated into the science fiction video game series Ecco the Dolphin. Delphineus, a dolphin, is featured in the video game , helping the boy, Adam, to find the sea king Cetus (a sperm whale), as well as assisting in cleaning up the underwater environment where he lives. [...] <b>Bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> were mentioned in various Star Trek novels and other materials as serving as navigation specialists on board various Federation starships.|$|R
40|$|A photo-identification study {{carried out}} in Bahía San Antonio (Patagonia Argentina) showed a {{variation}} in external morphology among year-round resident <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins.</b> Out of 63 individually identified <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins,</b> 15 were considered year-round residents of which three show variations in external morphology: they have a more falcate dorsal fin, darker coloration and shorter beak, physical characteristics described for the regional form of <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> present in the more southern province Chubut. The three morphologic distinct individuals, with one associated calf, could be re-identified {{in the study area}} up to 10 times over all the different seasons and up to now, no other <b>bottlenose</b> <b>dolphins</b> with similar characteristics could be observed in the area.
