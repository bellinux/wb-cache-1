5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, Charles Darwin {{formulated}} the scientific {{theory of evolution}} <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> <b>selection,</b> published in his book On the Origin of Species (1859). Evolution <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> is a process demonstrated by the observation that more offspring are produced than can possibly survive, along with three facts about populations: 1) traits vary among individuals with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour (phenotypic variation), 2) different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness), and 3) traits can be passed {{from generation to generation}} (heritability of fitness). Thus, in successive generations members of a population are replaced by progeny of parents better adapted to survive and reproduce in the biophysical environment in which natural selection takes place.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Natural</b> <b>selection</b> {{operated}} {{on the wild}} ancestors of crop plants for millions of years. Many seemingly intelligent design changes that we could make to enzyme structure or gene expression would duplicate (at least in phenotypic effect) variants already rejected <b>by</b> past <b>natural</b> <b>selection.</b> These variants died out because they decreased individual plant survival or reproduction under preagricultural conditions. Many of the variants rejected <b>by</b> past <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> would also reduce crop yield or quality today, {{so it would be}} a waste of time to duplicate them using molecular methods. For example, most changes to rubisco will decrease photosynthesis (and crop yield) under current conditions, just as they would have decreased photosynthesis (and individual plant fitness) under preagricultural conditions. A few of natural selection’s ‘rejects’, however, would be genuine improvements by human criteria. Can we identify these promising rejects? Opportunities for crop genetic improvement that were missed <b>by</b> past <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> are likely to fall into three major categories. First, and most important, conflicts of interest among competing plants, or between plants and their microbial symbionts, can cause trade-offs between individual plant fitness (favoured <b>by</b> past <b>natural</b> <b>selection)</b> and the collective performance of the crop community. Therefore, we can sometimes increase yield by reversing the effects of past <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> for individual competitiveness. Second, changes in climate, soil fertility and pest population...|$|R

5|$|Lamarck {{was largely}} {{ignored by the}} major French {{zoologist}} Cuvier, but he attracted much more interest abroad. The book was read carefully, but its thesis rejected, by nineteenth century scientists including the geologist Charles Lyell and the comparative anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Darwin acknowledged Lamarck as an important zoologist, and his theory a forerunner of Darwin's evolution <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> <b>selection.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rudimentary organs such as {{the human}} tailbone, now much reduced from their {{functional}} state, are readily understood as signs of evolution, the explanation being that they were cut down <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> from functioning organs when their functions were no longer needed, but make {{no sense at all}} if species are considered to be fixed. The tailbone is homologous to the tails of other primates.|$|E
5|$|Saltationism was {{the idea}} that new species arise as a result of large mutations. It was seen as a much faster {{alternative}} to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> <b>selection,</b> and was popular with early geneticists such as Hugo de Vries, William Bateson, and early in his career, Thomas Hunt Morgan. It became the basis of the mutation theory of evolution.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} life on Earth is not well understood, but it {{is known to have}} {{occurred}} at least 3.5billion years ago, during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present. These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared, the process of evolution <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.|$|E
5|$|The single-origin {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} the mechanism of evolution in most cases has been gene duplication followed <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> for adaptive traits. Some of the various adaptations produced by this process include venom more toxic to specific prey in several lineages, proteins that pre-digest prey, and a method to track down prey after a bite. These various adaptations of venom have also led to considerable debate about the definition of venom and venomous snakes.|$|E

5|$|After hatching, the {{offspring}} {{feed on the}} tissue of the cicadas provided by their mother. Males emerge before females and both genders are sexually receptive from emergence in July to early August, when they mate and brood. English naturalist Charles Darwin postulated that the pattern of male emergence before females evolved <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> to improve the chances of the male mating. The timing {{of the emergence of}} females has evolved to correspond with the similar emergence of the cicada species of the area, Tibicen duryi and T.parallela, which they hunt for the provisioning of their nests. Many have yellow markings located on their tergites (dorsal portion), although some have been found only from the first to fifth tergites.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{spent most}} of this time {{exploring}} on land: three years and three months on land, 18 months at sea. Early in the voyage {{he decided that he}} could write a book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> <b>selection.</b>|$|E

5|$|From {{the point}} of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. From {{the point of}} view of chemistry, a spiral can be generated by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Hugo de Vries {{tried to}} link the new {{genetics}} with evolution; building on his work with heredity and hybridization, he proposed a theory of mutationism, which was widely accepted in the early 20th century. Lamarckism also had many adherents. Darwinism was seen as incompatible with the continuously variable traits studied by biometricians, which seemed only partially heritable. In the 1920s and 1930s—following {{the acceptance of the}} Mendelian-chromosome theory— the emergence of the discipline of population genetics, with the work of R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, unified the idea of evolution <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> with Mendelian genetics, producing the modern synthesis. The inheritance of acquired characters was rejected, while mutationism gave way as genetic theories matured.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{evolutionary}} theory continues to develop. Darwin's {{theory of evolution}} <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> <b>selection,</b> with its tree-like model of branching common descent, has become the unifying theory of the life sciences. The theory explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment. It makes sense of the geologic record, biogeography, parallels in embryonic development, biological homologies, vestigiality, cladistics, phylogenetics and other fields, with unrivalled explanatory power; it has also become essential to applied sciences such as medicine and agriculture. Despite the scientific consensus, a religion-based political controversy has developed over how evolution is taught in schools, especially in the United States.|$|E

50|$|For Punnett, none {{of these}} {{observations}} were explained by gradual selectionism. Instead he thought mimicry had arisen from sudden mutational jumps (saltations). Once a mimic was formed <b>by</b> mutation, <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> might play a conservative role.|$|R

5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{will only}} cause evolution {{if there is}} enough genetic variation in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common hypothesis was blending inheritance. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> implausible. The Hardy–Weinberg principle provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. The frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant {{in the absence of}} selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.|$|E
5|$|Objections to {{evolution}} {{have been}} raised since evolutionary ideas came to prominence in the 19th century. When Charles Darwin published his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, his theory of evolution (the idea that species arose through descent with modification from a single common ancestor in a process driven <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> <b>selection)</b> initially met opposition from scientists with different theories, but eventually came to receive overwhelming acceptance in the scientific community. The observation of evolutionary processes occurring (as well as the modern evolutionary synthesis explaining that evidence) has been uncontroversial among mainstream biologists since the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|The Naturalist on the River Amazons, subtitled A Record of the Adventures, Habits of Animals, Sketches of Brazilian and Indian Life, and Aspects of Nature {{under the}} Equator, during Eleven Years of Travel, is an 1863 book by the British naturalist Henry Walter Bates about his {{expedition}} to the Amazon basin. Bates and his friend Alfred Russel Wallace set out to obtain new species and new evidence for evolution <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> <b>selection,</b> as well as exotic specimens to sell. He explored {{thousands of miles of}} the Amazon and its tributaries, and collected over 14,000 species, of which 8,000 were new to science. His observations of the coloration of butterflies led him to discover Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} wheels in nature is {{frequently}} attributed to constraints imposed <b>by</b> biology: <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> constrains the evolutionary paths available to species, and the {{processes by which}} multicellular organisms grow and develop may not permit {{the construction of a}} functioning wheel.|$|R
50|$|Female {{fecundity}}: Males {{benefit from}} a high female fecundity as it means that females can produce more offspring and have a higher potential for reproduction.

60|$|On the whole, we may {{conclude}} that habit, or use and disuse, have, in some cases, played a considerable {{part in the}} modification of the constitution and structure; but that the effects have often been largely combined with, and sometimes overmastered <b>by,</b> the <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> of innate variations.|$|R
