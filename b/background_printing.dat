2500|$|In 2016, {{yet another}} {{security}} feature arose {{in that the}} Backing Paper {{for all of the}} Machin self-adhesive stamps had a [...] Security <b>background</b> <b>printing</b> in Grey of [...] "ROYAL MAIL" [...] repeated (There are 3 types of this SBC of [...] "Security Backing Paper")in yet another attempt a thwarting forgeries, which seems to be an ongoing problem.|$|E
2500|$|The {{security}} features {{also included a}} minute change to the <b>background</b> <b>printing</b> of [...] "ROYAL MAIL" [...] where one letter is replaced to identify {{the source of the}} stamp. [...] For example, instead of [...] "ROYAL MAIL" [...] in one place in the upper right of the stamp is printed [...] "FOYAL MAIL" [...] to indicate that that stamp came from a booklet of four stamps. [...] This feature made it easier to identify the source of an individual, used stamp and track down production problems. The codes evolved further in the year 2010 when a year code was included as well. For instance MBIL/M11L means that the stamp came from a Business Sheet in 2011. The source codes are as follows: MBIL- From Business Sheets, MCIL- From Custom Retail Books with four Machins and two Special or Commemorative Stamps, MFIL- From Books of Four, MPIL- From Prestige Books, MRIL- From Coil Stamps in Rolls, MSIL- From Books of Six, MTIL- From Books of Twelve, and No source codes at all for Machin Stamps from Counter Sheets, though these do carry year codes.|$|E

50|$|After the Unilateral Declaration of Independence by Ian Smith in 1966, the British private {{banknote}} printer Bradbury Wilkinson & Co {{was ordered}} by the British government to cease printing currency for the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia as part of sanctions against the Unilateral declaration of independence. The Rhodesian government {{then went on to}} sign a contract with Giesecke & Devrient, in which the first order of its banknotes was seized by the British Secret service as counterfeit notes at Frankfurt Airport enroute to Harare (then Salisbury). The Reserve Bank of Rhodesia subsequently refused to pay Giesecke & Devrient for the seized notes. This forced Giesecke & Devrient CEO Siegfried Otto to quickly make arrangements to supply some of his old intaglio and <b>background</b> <b>printing</b> lines while he sourced for brand new Super printing lines for his new customer. The equipment was delivered in secrecy to a South African registered proxy company. By the time the British secret service realised of this the printing machines had already been shipped across the border from South Africa into Rhodesia and installed at the Bank Chambers, commonly referred to as the Old Reserve Bank Building along Samora Machel Avenue in Harare. A few months later Siegfried Otto sourced and delivered five new printing lines for Rhodesia from Organisation Giori and because Rhodesia was already recognised as a banknote printing country the British secret service could not interfere with the delivery of the machines. This arrangement further strengthened the position of Lousenthal, a Giesecke & Devrient subsidiary, as a banknote paper supplier to Rhodesia. A contract was then signed with Lousenthal being the banknote paper supplier to Rhodesia and subsequently Zimbabwe after attainment of independence.|$|E

50|$|DOS {{is not a}} {{multitasking}} operating system. DOS did however {{provide a}} Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) function which allowed programs to remain resident in memory. These programs could hook the system timer and/or keyboard interrupts to allow themselves to run tasks in the background or to be invoked at any time preempting the current running program effectively implementing a simple form of multitasking on a program-specific basis. The PRINT command did this to implement <b>background</b> <b>print</b> spooling. Borland Sidekick, a popup personal information manager (PIM), also used this technique.|$|R

40|$|<b>BACKGROUND</b> <b>Print</b> {{media are}} {{a major source of}} health information. OBJECTIVES To analyse press {{coverage}} related to skin cancer prevention. METHODS We conducted a content analysis of print media articles pertaining to skin cancer prevention, solaria and vitamin D published in Germany and Switzerland over a 1 -year period between 2012 and 2013. RESULTS Overall, 2, 103 articles were analysed. Applying sunscreen was by far the most common sun protection recommendation. A considerable number of articles on solaria and vitamin D advocated exposure to ultraviolet radiation to enhance physical appearance and vitamin D photosynthesis, often without mentioning any precaution measures. In total, 26. 8 % of the articles contained misleading or erroneous statements mostly related to sunscreen use and vitamin D issues. CONCLUSIONS Print media can serve as powerful education tools to foster skin cancer prevention. However, misleading or erroneous reports may negatively impact sun-safe behaviour. © 2015 S.
