5|$|SS {{officers}} {{told the}} victims {{they were to}} take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> yelling could still be heard over the engines.|$|E
25|$|Jerome completes his {{composition}} and is briefly ecstatic, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> violence outside brings {{him back to}} full awareness. He realises that to complete his music he has given up {{the chance of a}} reconciliation with his wife and child, and has put them in danger. He is distraught as the curtain closes.|$|E
25|$|In new construction, minimum {{requirements}} are typically more stringent. All smoke detectors must be hooked {{directly to the}} electrical wiring, be interconnected and have a battery backup. In addition, smoke detectors are required either inside or outside every bedroom, depending on local codes. Smoke detectors on the outside will detect fires more quickly, assuming the fire does not begin in the bedroom, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the alarm will be reduced and may not wake some people. Some areas also require smoke detectors in stairways, main hallways and garages.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{beams and}} boards {{breaking}} were so terrifying that {{for several minutes}} after the damage was done none of the crowd dared to move. Each felt as though the next second might be his last.|$|R
60|$|The {{evening was}} spent in feasting and rejoicing among the {{relations}} of <b>the</b> successful warriors; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> grief and wailing were heard from the hills adjacent to the village--the lamentations of women who had lost some relative in the foray.|$|R
2500|$|The {{next few}} nights, {{in an attempt}} to {{recreate}} the incident, local pilots flew prop-planes over the city in a [...] "V" [...] formation, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> their engines were easily heard. The original lights made no sound. Flares were also deployed above Phoenix.|$|R
500|$|As is {{the case}} with most of the {{material}} on their previous two albums, the songs of Deep Purple mix elements of progressive rock, hard rock and psychedelic rock, but this time in a darker and more baroque atmosphere. Perhaps in response to British audiences craving more blues-based rock, the band also incorporated a 12-bar blues structure on the songs [...] "The Painter" [...] and [...] "Why Didn't Rosemary?" [...] "Emmaretta" [...] is a pop rock song written to be a commercial single, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the album is heavier and more guitar-oriented than previous works, similar to how the band sounded live during this period.|$|E
500|$|Fallout 3 {{received}} universal acclaim, {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. 1UP.com's Demian Linn praised its open-ended gameplay and flexible character-leveling system. While the V.A.T.S. system was called [...] "fun", enemy encounters {{were said to}} suffer {{from a lack of}} precision in real-time combat and little variety in enemy types. The review concluded, Fallout 3 is a [...] "hugely ambitious game that doesn't come around very often". IGN editor Erik Brudvig praised the game's [...] "minimalist" [...] sound design, observing, [...] "you might find yourself with nothing <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> wind rustling through decaying trees and blowing dust across the barren plains ... Fallout 3 proves that less can be more". The review noted that the [...] "unusual amount of realism" [...] combined with the [...] "endless conversation permutations" [...] produces [...] "one of the most truly interactive experiences of the generation". In a review of the game for Kotaku, Mike Fahey commented that [...] "While Inon Zur's score is filled with epic goodness, the real stars of Fallout 3s music are the vintage songs from the 1940s".|$|E
500|$|Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} [...] "In {{addition}} to raising the Madonna/whore ante with songs like the title cut, Virgin cradled {{the kind of}} '80s hits ("Dress You Up") built to transcend the Dynasty era." [...] Alfred Soto from Stylus Magazine remembered {{the first time that}} he heard the songs from the album and commented, [...] "Lots of critics think something similar occurred when Madonna followed her eponymous debut with Like a Virgin, helmed by Nile Rodgers with all the fixin's—too calculated next to the 'raw passion' of the debut. This is nonsense; it misses how Madonna conflated notions of spontaneity and calculation. Rodgers is the ideal collaborator." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times said: [...] "With a tough-cookie voice that's both coy and streetwise, Madonna's singing harks back to the rock-and-roll girl-group tradition that preceded the Beatles. But where girl groups, from the Shirelles to the Ronettes, worshipfully extolled their boyfriends' cars, haircuts and rebel poses, Madonna's point of view is decidedly more self-interested. In matters of love, she is a comparison shopper with a shrewd sense of her own market value. The words 'shiny and new' describe not only the way the love-smitten singer feels in the title song <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the album." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{soldiers}} {{continue to}} demand Arturo's execution, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> a herald arriving are heard. He brings letters which are opened by Riccardo and Giorgio. They announce {{that although the}} Royalists have been defeated, Oliver Cromwell has pardoned all prisoners. The ensemble expresses its general and its personal joy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, always. All {{day while}} I am with the Maharanee and her women, and at night, the great silent Indian night {{when all the}} palace is asleep and there is heard nothing <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jungle, the cry of the hyena and the bray of the {{laughing}} jackass, I shall seem to hear your voice." ...|$|R
60|$|I did not answer, <b>but</b> at <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king's voice jackals stirred and slunk away.|$|R
500|$|After {{his return}} from {{military}} service in 1960, Presley continued to perform rock and roll, but the characteristic style was substantially toned down. The reason why the music from this period lacks the drama from his Fifties recordings, critic Dave Marsh writes, is [...] "because what we're hearing is not genius discovering itself <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> genius at work." [...] His first post-Army single, the number one hit [...] "Stuck on You", is typical of this shift. RCA publicity materials referred to its [...] "mild rock beat"; discographer Ernst Jorgensen calls it [...] "upbeat pop". The modern blues/R sound captured so successfully on Elvis Is Back! was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966–67 recordings as [...] "Down in the Alley" [...] and [...] "Hi-Heel Sneakers", though Marsh holds that while he may have recorded few blues songs {{in the early to}} middle Sixties, [...] "blues informs almost everything here." [...] The singer's output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music, often in the form of ballads such as [...] "Are You Lonesome Tonight?", a number one in 1960. While that was a dramatic number, most of what Presley recorded for his film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein. Notable numbers in other genres are the No. 1 hits [...] "It's Now or Never" [...] of 1960, based on the Italian aria [...] "O Sole Mio" [...] and concluding with a [...] "full-voiced operatic cadence," [...] and the 1962 hit [...] "She's Not You" [...] which [...] "integrates the Jordanaires so completely, it's practically doo-wop." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rumbula {{was a small}} {{railroad}} station [...] south of Riga, the capital and major city of Latvia, which was connected with Daugavpils, the second largest city in Latvia, by the rail line along {{the north side of}} the Daugava river. [...] Located on a hill about [...] from the station, the massacre site was a [...] "rather open and accessible place". The view was blocked by vegetation, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> gunfire would have been audible from the station grounds. [...] The area lay between the rail line and the Riga-Daugavpils highway, with the rail line to the north of the highway. Rumbula was part of a forest and swamp area known in Latvian as Vārnu mežs, which means Crow Forest in English. The sounds of gun fire could be and were heard from the highway. The Nazi occupation authorities carried out a number of other massacres on the north bank of the Daugava in the Rumbula vicinity. [...] The soil was sandy and it was easy to dig graves. [...] While the surrounding pine woods were sparse, there was a heavily forested area in the center which became the execution site. The rail line and highway made it easy to move the victims in from Riga (it had to be within walking distance of the Riga Ghetto on the southeast side of the city), as well as transport the murderers and their arms.|$|E
60|$|They ran {{at the top}} {{of their}} speed, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the horses' feet grew louder.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{structure}} <b>but</b> not <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> Jewish cantillation {{influenced the}} composition, particularly of the flute and piccolo melodies [...]|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir?" [...] said Jeeves. He {{had been}} {{clearing}} away <b>the</b> breakfast things, <b>but</b> at <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young master's voice cheesed it courteously.|$|R
60|$|Still {{the doctor}} spoke {{soothing}} words, and still {{he held her}} hand. He knew that his words could not console her; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> his kindness at such desolate moments are, to such minds as hers, some alleviation of grief. She hardly answered him, but sat there staring out before her, leaving her hand passively to him, and swaying her head backwards and forwards as though her grief were too heavy to be borne.|$|R
60|$|The sound became {{louder and}} clearer. The echo was still continuous, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the shots could be {{distinctly}} heard.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I assure you,’ {{said the}} elder gentleman, ‘I not only heard the {{slamming}} of a door, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> very guarded footsteps.’ ...|$|E
60|$|I needed <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> {{his voice}} to be so madly enraged as I never was before, and never have been since.|$|E
50|$|Entrances of RTC {{members were}} {{accompanied}} {{not by the}} standard musical theme <b>but</b> by <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> shrill alarms and buzzers, with an underlying swing jazz beat.|$|R
5000|$|The McGurk {{effect can}} also be {{achieved}} with nonlinguistic stimuli, such as showing someone a video of a basketball bouncing <b>but</b> playing <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a ping-pong ball bouncing.|$|R
60|$|<b>But,</b> now, <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> wheels {{was heard}} again outside the door; and {{somebody}} exclaimed that Gruff and Tackleton was coming back. Speedily that worthy gentleman appeared, looking warm and flustered.|$|R
6000|$|... "I assure you," [...] {{said the}} elder gentleman, [...] "I not only heard the {{slamming}} of a door, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> very guarded footsteps." ...|$|E
60|$|Both heads disappeared, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> {{whispering}} continued. Then {{one of them}} {{rose again}} among the green grasses as a man might rise out of water. It was Ithiel's.|$|E
60|$|Here Lucy leant {{back and}} shut the door behind her, so that Anne and Helen could {{distinguish}} nothing <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> Mrs. Hazleby's loud angry voice raised to its highest pitch.|$|E
6000|$|... "Again this mummery!" [...] said Everard. [...] "I am better armed than I was of late; and <b>but</b> for <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> that voice, <b>the</b> speaker {{had bought}} his trifling dear." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> {{presently}} <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bassoon and the key-bugles burst forth; {{the evening}} hymn, which always opened the service, had begun, {{and every one}} must now enter and take his place.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> at <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> {{his voice}} {{she seemed to}} {{experience}} a shock of fear or horror; started back; lowered her veil with a sudden movement; and fled, without turning, from the square.|$|R
60|$|Jet {{thought it}} {{possible}} he might yet escape, and {{started toward the}} shelter of the trees; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> his footsteps soon told the brute where to look for his prey.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are only}} too glad," [...] replied the mother. [...] "Nothing {{all day long}} <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the sluice—and mists, and rotten leaves. I am thankful to hear a fresh voice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{can get in}} somewhere," [...] {{continued}} Bell. [...] "There {{are plenty}} of lodgings in Guestwick, you know." [...] <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the word lodgings was uncomfortable in Mrs Dale's ears.|$|E
60|$|They {{walked across}} the {{clearing}} to <b>the</b> spot, <b>but</b> although <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> their footsteps must have reached his ear, the man {{did not look up}} until Harold touched him on the shoulder.|$|R
60|$|The Duke had not {{greeted me}} on my entrance, {{and he seemed to}} be asleep in his chair. <b>But</b> at <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{electric}} bell, which announced the opening of the safe, he turned sharply round.|$|R
50|$|Later, {{he is in}} a bar {{having a}} drink with a friend before heading home, and shows him a lion's-tooth charm his wife has given him. Supposedly the tooth will protect him against a lion attack. Alan begins to head home but finds his car won't start. He {{attempts}} to return to <b>the</b> bar <b>but</b> it is locked and he has forgotten his lion's-tooth charm inside. He attempts to use a pay phone, but it's out of order. As Alan walks away, the phone rings. He answers it and hears nothing <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jungle.|$|R
