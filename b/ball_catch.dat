50|$|The monster chases Scooby, {{and soon}} {{afterward}} Shaggy, {{out onto the}} parade route. After running off the spectators and smashing into floats, Scooby knocks it down with the soccer ball from the alley and he and Shaggy rejoin Velma, Fred, and Daphne. The group tries to subdue the monster but it disappears {{in a cloud of}} smoke. The police cordone the area and the kids who lost their soccer <b>ball</b> <b>catch</b> up to Shaggy and Scooby to ask for their autographed missing ball. Velma identifies the monster as a trickster called 'Eshu'. Fred promises the kids they will find the autographed ball and the gang ask Julio Luna, the director of the games, for help. He tells them all the spilled soccer balls on the parade route were taken back to the stadium, including the kids' ball that was mixed in with them.|$|E

30|$|Letter {{originates}} in a now virtually obsolete verb let as in without let or hinderance and the tennis expression let ball (where the <b>ball</b> <b>catches</b> the net) from the Old English lettan meaning “to hinder”. Thus letter meant “someone or something which hindered”. This verb let {{came to be}} homonymous with the more frequent modern English verb let, originally laetan “to permit, allow” after the latter was subject to regular sound change. Obviously a language cannot easily tolerate homonymous antonyms (auto-antonyms), and the verb {{with the sense of}} “hinder” largely disappeared.|$|R

5000|$|Manigault was {{particularly}} {{famous for his}} leaping abilities on the basketball court. However much of his legend is unsupported playground myth, including his signature move - the double dunk. He allegedly would dunk the <b>ball,</b> <b>catch</b> it with his left hand, switch the ball to his right hand, bring it back around {{to the top of}} the basket and jam it through again, all done while still in the air on a single jump, and without hanging on the rim. However this is a story repeatedly told but unconfirmed. It was refuted by Manigault himself in a CNN interview available on YouTube when he called the reports of this feat rubbish, stating not even The Goat could do that. Like other street basketballers of the day such as Jackie Jackson, Earl was reportedly able to touch the top of the backboard to retrieve quarters and dollar bills, part of [...] "elaborate innovations and tricks" [...] elite street players of the era performed before games to help build their reputations. Again, this has never been confirmed. Like the dunking myth,it is always referred to as [...] "reportedly" [...] without a credible source to support it. It is refuted in Todd Gallagher's book [...] " [...] Andy Roddick Beat Me With a Frying Pan." [...] The book dedicates an entire chapter to this myth concluding it was never done by Manigault or anyone else, including NBA stars.Gallagher writes [...] " [...] Earl [...] "The Goat" [...] Manigault is widely regarded as one of the greatest playground basketball players of all time. Although he never played in the NBA and only briefly played in college, the legend of Manigault has spread far and wide and led to his play being glorified in magazines, books, and even a movie starring Don Cheadle called Rebound: The Legend of Earl [...] "The Goat" [...] Manigault. There are a number of tales regarding Manigault's prowess, but the central story that propelled his legend was that he had such extraordinary leaping ability he could pull dollar bills off the top of the backboard and leave change. What made this even more amazing was that Manigault was, depending on who you talk to, somewhere between 5-11 and 6-1. Considering that the top of the backboard is at thirteen feet and the average six-foot-tall man can only touch about eight feet high standing flat-footed, Manigault would have had to jump at least sixty inches to even come close. He was only 6' 1", but attributed his tremendous jumping ability to having in childhood often worn ankle weights during practice. (Such efficacy of ankle weights is doubtful, however.) He once dunked two-handed during a game from near the foul line over two players much taller than himself (Sahil Muliyil 6'8", David Urenda 6'9"). He once reverse dunked 36 times in a row to win a $60 bet.|$|E

40|$|DE 3915862 A UPAB: 19930928 The {{motor vehicle}} is {{provided}} with a centrally controlled locking system for the doors, boot lid, and bonnet. Each lock is actuated by means of two rolling diaphragms (10, 11) installed in chambers (4) and (5) respectively which are mounted side by side. The diagram shows the lock mechanism in the locked position. The lock is released either by actuating an outside lever (24) or an inside lever (25) which set the pump (8) operating. This pump draws air from the chamber (5) so that the rolling diaphragm moves upwards and swings the anti-theft lever (17) upwards. The rod (27) attached to the diaphragm (11) opens the valve (9) so that air is drawn from the second chamber (4) and the second diaphragm moves upwards together with the rod (12) to allow the security lever (14) to move upwards. The mechanism is held in this position by a spring-loaded <b>ball</b> <b>catch</b> (20). USE - Central locking for motor vehicles. 1 /...|$|E

50|$|Imagine a {{baseball}} pitcher throwing one ball every second to a catcher (a frequency of 1 ball per second). Assuming the balls travel {{at a constant}} velocity and the pitcher is stationary, the catcher <b>catches</b> one <b>ball</b> every second. However, if the pitcher is jogging towards the catcher, the catcher <b>catches</b> <b>balls</b> more frequently because the balls are less spaced out (the frequency increases). The inverse is true if the pitcher is {{moving away from the}} man. He <b>catches</b> <b>balls</b> less frequently because of the pitcher's backward motion (the frequency decreases). If the pitcher moves at an angle, but at the same speed, the frequency variation at which the receiver <b>catches</b> <b>balls</b> is less, as the distance between the two changes more slowly.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to improve learning outcomes captured throw the ball through the game sebbol for mental retardation students in the elementary school class II Extraordinary School Slawi, Tegal regency. This study uses action research. In the implementation consists of two cycles. Each cycle consists of four stages, namely : planning, implementation, observation, and reflection.

40|$|Mu rhythm, {{one of the}} EEG alpha components, is {{recorded}} at the central region on the scalp corresponding to the sensorimotor area, and is reduced by activation of the brain motor system. It {{has been reported that}} high-functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorders(ASD) show mu power suppression related to self-performed hand movements but not when observing those performed by others. To clarify whether these phenomena were specific to high-functioning individuals with ASD, we measured mu power for observing and executing movements in 14 non- ASD and 11 ASD children (the age ranged from 6 to 18 years old) with intellectual disabilities. EEG rhythms were recorded on the scalp while subjects were resting with eyes open; watching animated clips of ball throw, <b>ball</b> <b>catch,</b> paper rock (i. e., opening and closing of fist) and bouncing ball; moving their own hand to catch a ball and do paper rock. We focused on the alpha component at the central region contralateral to the dominant hand. In the non-ASD group, alpha power was distinctly suppressed when subjects observed other's paper rock and performed their own, compared with rest and other conditions. We consider that this alpha component was mu rhythm and the power suppression indicated activation of the brain system for simple motor tasks than for complex tasks such as ball handling. Mu suppression for simple actual and observed tasks such as paper rock were less in the ASD group than in the non-ASD group. We suggest that this weak activation of observation and execution system for movement is characteristic of individuals with both ASD and intellectual disabilities but not of non-ASD ones with intellectual disabilities. Furthermore, since there was a little mu suppression for simple tasks in children with ASD, we should investigate a required condition to activate the brain motor system for children with ASD...|$|E
