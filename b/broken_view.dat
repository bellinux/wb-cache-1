His videos on the channel have been viewed over 200,000,000 times. [...] "Wuz Up World? (What's up World?)"—DeStorm's catch phrase—can be heard at the start or end of every video. DeStorm often composes and performs covers or Beatbox covers of well known songs or creates content for major brands such as Pepsi, GE, Yahoo and Nintendo. DeStorm also creates original content based upon subscribers' challenges and suggestions, such as rapping in alphabetical order or name dropping various movie titles in a rap. Power occasionally collaborates with other popular YouTube personalities and recording artists, such as Mystery Guitar Man, Freddie Wong, Ray William Johnson, Nice Peter and Kina Grannis. One of Power's most popular series on the channel is Rap Up, which Power began in 2009. Power also competed in a commercial contest hosted by Heinz Ketchup and was a finalist. Despite {{the success of his}} YouTube channel, Power announced in 2013 that his next major song release will be televised on MTV. In April 2013, Power authored an op-ed on New Media Rockstars, detailing his concerns with the <b>broken</b> <b>view</b> counter on his DeStorm channel. He also won two comedy awards. Destorm was also featured a headliner on the Digitour in the summer of 2010, in which he and other Youtubers traveled around the country performing their songs from YouTube.In 2014, DeStorm Power was listed on New Media Rockstars Top 100 Channels, ranked at #85.|$|E

Patriarchal system, generated by or thriving on sovereign ideology and handed down from one generation to another, is a part of this ideology.

Narrations that legitimize the existing system through concrete representative strategies and the effects they have created play an important role in consolidating and normalizing the social roles of men and women by the gender representations they already possess.

40|$|After booming from 2009 to 2012, the German {{photovoltaic}} (PV) industry {{suffered from}} drastically reduced feed-in tariffs (FITs).

60|$|In {{this case}} the old belief of rudiments having been created to {{complete}} the scheme of nature is so far from holding good, that all ordinary rules are completely <b>broken</b> through. The <b>view</b> which seems the most probable is that some early progenitor of Onitis acquired, like other Lamellicorns, horns {{on the head and}} thorax, and then transferred them, in a rudimentary condition, as with so many existing species, to the female, by whom they have ever since been retained. The subsequent loss of the horns by the male may have resulted through the principle of compensation from the development of the projections on the lower surface, whilst the female has not been thus affected, as she is not furnished with these projections, and consequently has retained the rudiments of the horns on the upper surface. Although this view is supported by the case of Bledius immediately to be given, yet the projections on the lower surface differ greatly in structure and development in the males of the several species of Onitis, and are even rudimentary in some; nevertheless the upper surface in all these species is quite destitute of horns. As secondary sexual characters are so eminently variable, {{it is possible that the}} projections on the lower surface may have been first acquired by some progenitor of Onitis and produced their effect through compensation, and then have been in certain cases almost completely lost.|$|R

40|$|The {{capacities}} of innovation {{have been widely}} recognized as central to the knowledge economy. The notion of interactive innovation based on collective knowledge has <b>broken</b> the traditional <b>view</b> of innovation which is focused on individual firms and industries. There is an increasing trend towards collaboration not only between different academic disciplines, but also between academics, business practitioners and government. Such a trend is manifested in the emerging concept of Triple Helix relations of universitygovernment- industry, which {{has been seen as}} the key driver and strategic model for creating knowledge-basedin novation. However, critically reviewing the literature reveals that the appropriateness and effectiveness of implementing Triple Helix remain problematic. This research aims to examine and evaluate the processes of creating knowledge-based innovation through successful implementation of Triple Helix relations of universitygovernment- industry to generate innovation capacities in the North East of England. The TH in this thesis is regarded as a heuristic model of creating knowledge-based innovation and a guide to innovation policy making. Following the establishment of a theoretical framework for analyzing the process whereby innovation capacities are generated and enhanced, a pilot study was conducted with the involvement of the regional government agency and sub-regional partners. Furthermore, a main study was carried out and data were collected from 48 in-depth semi-structured interviews with senior government officials, business managers from local support organizations, regional firms, technology transfer centres, spin-off companies and academics from universities in the North East of England. The research findings suggest that while recognizing the significance of its strategic thinking, the strategic intention of Triple Helix for knowledge-based innovation has been challenged from a number of perspectives during the process of implementation. First, the cooperative relations of university-government-industry remain fragmented due to diverse self-interests and different perceptions of the roles performed by innovation actors. Second, the loosely coupled partnership relations between university-governmentindustry created confusion at different levels in coordinating and leading projects related to knowledge creation. Furthermore, the Triple Helix is also challenged by the preconditions such as institutional norms and culture gaps between university and industry, originating from the historical context of the region, which have hindered the development of new ideas and innovation. Finally, despite limited evidence of academics, business managers and government officials interacting across institutional boundaries and learning each other's roles, the effectiveness of such interactions for knowledge creation is still strongly affected by their traditional roles and institutional values. Triple Helix, as a heuristic concept emerging from the dynamic knowledge economy, has certainly offered strategic value that reinforces the understanding of the importance of university-government-industry relations in generating knowledge-based innovation. However, empirical evidence from the research indicates that the totality of the Triple Helix concept is facing challenges in practice and needs to be further validated in a much wider context. The distinctiveness of this research lies in contributing to the existing theories of Triple Helix by highlighting the importance of redefining the strategic intentions and roles of key actors in building up knowledge-based innovation. The research findings also have significant implications for government policy makers, business practitioners and university academics when addressing the existing deficiencies in the implementation of knowledge-based innovation strategies in the regions. This may enable innovation actors to think beyond Triple Helix, taking into consideration the preconditions, institutional dynamics and complex networking processes for the success of knowledge-based innovation. Future research is suggested to investigate Triple Helix networks during the implementation of the new knowledge-based initiative - Science City in the North East of England.

6000|$|PROFESSOR STOWE then said, [...] "On {{behalf of}} Mrs. Stowe I will read from her pen the {{response}} to your generous offering: 'It is {{impossible for me to}} express the feelings of my heart at the kind and generous manner in which I have been received upon English shores. Just when I had begun to realize that a whole wide ocean lay between me and all that is dearest to me, I found most unexpectedly a home and friends waiting to receive me here. I have had not an hour in which to know the heart of a stranger. I have been made to feel at home since the first moment of landing, and wherever I have looked I have seen only the faces of friends. It is with deep feeling that I have found myself on ground that has been consecrated and made holy by the prayers and efforts of those who first commenced the struggle for that sacred cause which has proved so successful in England, and which I have a solemn assurance will yet be successful in my own country. It is a touching thought that here so many have given all that they have, and are, in behalf of oppressed humanity. It is touching to remember that one of the noblest men which England has ever produced now lies stricken under the heavy hand of disease, through a last labor of love in this cause. May God grant us all to feel that nothing is too dear or precious to be given in a work for which such men have lived, and labored, and suffered. No great good is ever wrought out for the human race without the suffering of great hearts. They who would serve their fellow-men are ever reminded that the Captain of their salvation was made perfect through suffering. I gratefully accept the offering confided to my care, and trust it may be so employed that the blessing of many [...] "who are ready to perish" [...] will return upon your heads. Let me ask those--those fathers and mothers in Israel--who have lived and prayed many years for this cause, that as they prayed for their own country in the hour of her struggle, so they will pray now for ours. Love and prayer can hurt no one, can offend no one, and prayer is a real power. If the hearts of all the real Christians of England are poured out in prayer, it will be felt through the heart of the whole American church. Let us all look upward, from our own feebleness and darkness, to Him of whom it is said, [...] "He shall not fail nor be discouraged till he have set judgment in the earth." [...] To him, the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.'--These are the words, my friends, which Mrs. Stowe has written, and I cannot forbear to add a few words of my own. It was our intention, as the invitation to visit Great Britain came from Glasgow, to make our first landing there. But it was ordered by Providence that we should land here; and surely there is no place in the kingdom where a landing could be more appropriate, and where the reception could have been more cordial. [Hear, hear!] It was wholly unexpected by us, I can assure you. We know that there were friendly hearts here, for we had received abundant testimonials to that effect from letters which had come to us across the Atlantic--letters wholly unexpected, and which filled our souls with surprise; but we had no thought that there was such a feeling throughout England, and we scarcely know how to conduct ourselves under it, for we are not accustomed to this kind of receptions. In our own country, unhappily, we are very much divided, and the preponderance of feeling expressed is in the other direction, entirely in opposition, and not in favor. [Hear, hear!] We knew that this city had been the scene of some of the greatest, most disinterested, and most powerful efforts in behalf of emancipation. The name of Clarkson was indissolubly associated with this place, for here he came to make his investigations, and here he was in danger of his life, and here he was protected by friends who stood by him through the whole struggle. The names of Cropper, and of Stephen, and of many others in this city, were very familiar to us--[Hear, hear!]--and it was in connection with this city that we received what to our feelings was a most effective testimonial, an unexpected letter from Lord Denman, whom we have always venerated. When I was in England in 1836, there were no two persons whom I more desired to see than the Duke of Wellington and Lord Denman; and soon I sought admission to the House of Lords, where I had the pleasure both of seeing and hearing England's great captain; and I found my way to the Court of Queen's Bench, where I had the pleasure of seeing and hearing England's great judge. But how unexpected was all this to us! When that book was written, in sorrow, and in sadness, and obscurity, and with the heart almost <b>broken</b> in the <b>view</b> of the sufferings which it described, and the still greater sufferings which it dared not describe, there was no expectation of any thing but the prayers of the sufferers and the blessing of God, who has said that the seed which is buried in the earth shall spring up in his own good time; and though it may be long buried, it will still at length come forth and bear fruit. We never could believe that slavery in our land would be a perpetual curse; but we felt, and felt deeply, that there must be a terrible struggle before we could be delivered from it, and that there must be suffering and martyrdom in this cause, as in every other great cause; for a struggle of eighteen years had taught us its strength. And, under God, we rely very much on the Christian public of Great Britain; for every expression of feeling from the wise and good of this land, with whatever petulance it may be met by some, {{goes to the heart of}} the American people. [Hear, hear!] You must not judge of the American people by the expressions which have come across the Atlantic in reference to the subject. Nine tenths of the American people, I think, are, in opinion at least, with you on this great subject; [Hear, hear!] but there is a tremendous pressure brought to bear upon all who are in favor of emancipation. The whole political power, the whole money power, almost the whole ecclesiastical power is wielded in defence of slavery, protecting it from all aggression; and it is as much as a man's reputation is worth to utter a syllable boldly and openly on the other side. Let me say to the ladies who have been active in getting up the address on the subject of slavery, that you have been doing a great and glorious work, and a work most appropriate for you to do; for in slavery it is woman that suffers most intensely, and the suffering woman has a claim upon the sympathy of her sisters in other lands. This address will produce a powerful impression throughout the country. There are ladies already of the highest character in the nation pondering how they shall make a suitable response, and what they shall do in reference to it that will be acceptable to the ladies of the United Kingdom, or will be profitable to the slave; and in due season you will see that the hearts of American women are alive to this matter, as well as the hearts of the women of this country. [Hear, hear!] Such was the mighty influence brought to bear upon every thing that threatened slavery, that had it not been for the decided expression on this side of the Atlantic in reference to the work which has exerted, under God, so much influence, there is every reason to fear that it would have been crushed and put under foot, as many other efforts for the overthrow of slavery have been in the United States. But it is impossible; the unanimous voice of Christendom prohibits it; and it shows that God has a work to accomplish, and that he has just commenced it. There are social evils in England. Undoubtedly there are; but the difference between the social evils in England and this great evil of slavery in the United States is just here: In England, the power of the government and the power of Christian sympathy are exerted for the removal of those evils. Look at the committees of inquiry in Parliament, look at the amount of information collected with regard to the suffering poor in their reports, and see how ready the government of Great Britain is to enter into those inquiries, and to remove those evils. Look at the benevolent institutions of the United Kingdom, and see how active all these are in administering relief; and then see the condition of slavery in the United States, where the whole power of the government is used in the contrary direction, where every influence is brought to bear to prevent any mitigation of the evil, and where every voice that is lifted to plead for a mitigation is drowned in vituperation and abuse from those who are determined that the evil shall not be mitigated. This is the difference: England repents and reforms. America refuses to repent and reform. It is said, 'Let each country take care of itself, and let the ladies of England attend to their own business.' Now I have always found that those who labor at home are those who labor abroad; [Hear, hear!] and those who say, 'Let us do the work at home,' are those who do no work of good either at home or abroad. [Hear, hear!] It was just so when the great missionary effort came up in the United States. They said, 'We have a great territory here. Let us send missionaries to our own territories. Why should we send missionaries across the ocean?' But those who sent missionaries across the ocean were those who sent missionaries in the United States; and those who did not send missionaries across the ocean were those who sent missionaries nowhere. [Hear, hear!] They who say, 'Charity begins at home,' are generally those who have no charity; and when I see a lady whose name is signed to this address, I am sure to find a lady who is exercising her benevolence at home. Let me thank you for all the interest you have manifested and for all the kindness which we have received at your hands, which we shall ever remember, both with gratitude to you and to God our Father." ...|$|R
