500|$|Waddington bowled with control, {{maintaining}} a good length while his action made the ball swing {{away from the}} batsman. For variation, he delivered an off-cutter and when he bowled, the ball seemed to increase its speed after bouncing. He often bowled around the wicket. His curved run-up began from the on side of the wicket, and he ran behind the umpire. He then released the ball {{from the corner of}} the bowling crease, creating a sharp angle for the batsman to face, sometimes using short deliveries with a ring of leg side fielders. Waddington modelled his bowling on that of George Hirst, a fellow left-arm paceman who also acted as a coach and mentor to him in his early career, but Derek Hodgson notes that the two men were very different in personality: Waddington was far more quick-tempered than Hirst. Waddington's bowling action was noted for its excellence and perfection. Neville Cardus, the journalist and cricket writer, described it as [...] "gloriously rhythmical", and [...] "so lovely that one simply cannot deny he is a good bowler." [...] <b>But</b> <b>too</b> <b>often,</b> Cardus suggested, he was [...] "ever raising hopes that real greatness will come from him, only to disappoint again and again".|$|E
500|$|Yardley played schoolboy cricket at St Peter's, York. A highly talented all-round sportsman, {{he went to}} St John's College, Cambridge, and won Blues at cricket, squash, rugby fives {{and field}} hockey. In the {{university}} matches, he scored 90 in his second year, 101 in his third and was captain for his final year. He made his Yorkshire debut in 1936 and played for the county [...] until 1955, when he retired as a player. He made his Test match debut against South Africa in 1939 and after the Second World War was chosen as vice-captain to Wally Hammond on the 1946—47 tour of Australia where he captained England in the fifth Test. He followed Hammond as skipper in 1947, and captained England intermittently until 1950 when his business commitments allowed. In 1948 he succeeded to the Yorkshire leadership when Brian Sellers resigned. Yardley remained in the position until 1955, {{during a time when}} Yorkshire had several difficult players in their dressing room. Under Yardley, Yorkshire were joint champions in 1949 <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> for the liking of supporters, finished second to Surrey in the County Championship. He served as a Test match selector between 1951 and 1954, acting as chairman of selectors in 1952. He was President of Yorkshire C.C.C. from 1981 to 1983, when he resigned after becoming involved in controversy over the decision to release Geoffrey Boycott in 1983. He died after a stroke in 1989.|$|E

500|$|The Guardians Andrew Pulver {{was less}} enthusiastic, calling the film {{a mix of}} [...] "wafer-thin psychodrama" [...] and [...] "plot-generator dialogue". Times Richard Corliss said the action was let down by [...] "inert" [...] drama, {{describing}} the film as [...] "45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome." [...] Justin Chang of Variety criticized it as loud and lacking the nuance and subtlety of del Toro's previous films. The New Yorkers Anthony Lane's verdict read as [...] "It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered—long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant." [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Mike LaSalle reacted extremely negatively by stating [...] "If {{this is the best}} we can do in terms of movies—hoif something like this can speak to the soul of audiences—maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with… Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us Pan's Labyrinth not too many years ago, used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. <b>But</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> he gets lost in his computer…Why go to the movies to look at somebody else's computer after looking at your own all week?… The actors can't make Pacific Rim any better. They can only relieve some of the pain." [...] Slant Magazines Ed Gonzalez, who said the film lacked poignancy, compared it to a video game: [...] "a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle". The Wraps Alonso Duralde criticized the choice to set most battles at night or during the rain, feeling it detracted from the action, and said the comic relief actors—Day, Gorman, and Perlman—stole the film from the less interesting leads. Jordan Hoffman of Film.com identified Hunnam as the weak link in the cast, calling him a [...] "charisma black hole". Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald was particularly critical of the film, awarding the action sequences [...] "five IQ points out of five" [...] as he described the film as an hour and twenty minutes of fight sequences vaguely connected by ten minutes of story.|$|E
2500|$|Galaxy {{reviewer}} Groff Conklin described Legend as [...] "a weird [...] rather slow-moving first novel... a horrid, violent, sometimes exciting <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> overdone tour de force." [...] Anthony Boucher {{praised the}} novel, saying [...] "Matheson {{has added a}} new variant on the Last Man theme... and has given striking vigor to his invention by a forceful style of storytelling which derives from the best hard-boiled crime novels".|$|E
2500|$|... {{provided}} another close finish. The Honda-powered Williams cars of Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell looked untouchable, <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> {{they took}} points from each other, allowing McLaren's Prost {{to stay in}} touch. Although Williams easily won the Constructors' Championship that year, {{it was not until}} the season-ending Grand Prix of Australia that the Drivers' title was decided, Prost making the most of both Williams drivers tyre problems. [...] saw the Williams grow only stronger, with Piquet driving more consistent races to take his 3rd title ahead of Mansell who crashed in Japan in practice forcing him to sit out for the final 2 races.|$|E
6000|$|Oh! it {{is terrible}} {{to think that}} from the Fall till now man has gone on {{continually}} producing and reproducing scenes like this--sometimes, no doubt, unavoidably; <b>but</b> <b>often,</b> <b>too</b> <b>often,</b> because of some trifling error, or insult, {{on the part of}} statesmen, or some paltry dispute about a boundary, or, not infrequently, on grounds so shadowy and complex that succeeding historians have found it almost impossible to convey the meaning thereof to the intellects of average men! ...|$|R

60|$|Lady Loring waited by her in silence.
