5|$|Brain tissue consumes a {{large amount}} of energy in {{proportion}} to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons. Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of <b>basal</b> <b>metabolism</b> to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar), but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic and heptanoic acids), lactate, acetate, and possibly amino acids.|$|E
25|$|Birds {{have both}} REM and NREM sleep, and the EEG {{patterns}} of both have similarities {{to those of}} mammals. Different birds sleep different amounts, but the associations seen in mammals between sleep and variables such as body mass, brain mass, relative brain mass, <b>basal</b> <b>metabolism</b> and other factors (see below) are not found in birds. The only clear explanatory factor for the variations in sleep amounts for birds of different species is that birds who sleep in environments where {{they are exposed to}} predators have less deep sleep than birds sleeping in more protected environments.|$|E
25|$|Modern non-avian {{reptiles}} exhibit {{some form}} of cold-bloodedness (i.e. some mix of poikilothermy, ectothermy, and bradymetabolism) so that they have limited physiological means of keeping the body temperature constant and often rely on external sources of heat. Due to a less stable core temperature than birds and mammals, reptilian biochemistry requires enzymes capable of maintaining efficiency over a greater range of temperatures than in the case for warm-blooded animals. The optimum body temperature range varies with species, but is typically below that of warm-blooded animals; for many lizards, it falls in the 24°–35°C (75°–95°F) range, while extreme heat-adapted species, like the American desert iguana Dipsosaurus dorsalis, can have optimal physiological temperatures in the mammalian range, between 35° and 40°C (95° and 104°F). While the optimum temperature is often encountered when the animal is active, the low <b>basal</b> <b>metabolism</b> makes body temperature drop rapidly when the animal is inactive.|$|E

25|$|As with birds, {{the main}} rule for mammals (with certain exceptions, see below) {{is that they}} have two {{essentially}} different stages of sleep: REM and NREM sleep (see above). Mammals' feeding habits are associated with their sleep length. The daily need for sleep is highest in carnivores, lower in omnivores and lowest in herbivores. Humans sleep less than many other omnivores but otherwise not unusually much or unusually little in comparison with other mammals. Many herbivores, like Ruminantia (such as cattle), spend much of their wake time in a state of drowsiness, which perhaps could partly explain their relatively low need for sleep. In herbivores, an inverse correlation is apparent between body mass and sleep length; big mammals sleep less than smaller ones. This correlation is thought to explain about 25% of the difference in sleep amount between different mammals. Also, the length of a particular sleep cycle is associated with the size of the animal; on average, bigger animals will have sleep cycles of longer durations than smaller animals. Sleep amount is also coupled to factors like <b>basal</b> <b>metabolism,</b> brain mass, and relative brain mass. The duration of sleep among species is also directly related to basal metabolic rate (BMR). Rats, which have a high BMR, sleep for up to 14 hours a day, whereas elephants and giraffes, which have lower BMRs, sleep only 3–4 hours per day.|$|E

Daily energy expenditure (DEE), measured using doubly-labeled water, {{was only slightly}} higher in the chicks from the polar environments, despite the higher levels of <b>basal</b> <b>metabolisms</b> (BMR) and higher costs for thermoregulation.

A simple model indicates that the magnitude of these savings is dictated by the parental time budget (i. e. the minimal foraging time needed to meet age-dependent energy requirements of chick). Basal metabolic rate in chicks of the six available studies increased with latitude. The differences could relate to a higher capacity to produce heat, which is necessary in polar environments. The basal-metabolic-rate levels in adult terms, however, do not match this latitudinal pattern for the growing chicks. Ontogenetic studies over a longer time scale would be required to clarify these discrepancies in latitudinal pattern of BMR, for which a functional explanation is given in terms of differences in migratory biology...|$|R

40|$|Excessive sugar intake might {{increase}} the risk to develop eating disorders via an altered reward circuitry, but it remains unknown whether different sugar sources induce different neural effects and whether these effects are dependent from body weight. Therefore, we compared the effects of three high-fat and isocaloric diets varying only in their carbohydrate sources on brain activity of reward-related regions, and assessed whether brain activity is dependent on insulin sensitivity. Twenty-four minipigs underwent 18 FDG PET brain imaging following 7 -month intake of high-fat diets of which 20 % in dry matter weight (36. 3 % of metabolisable energy) was provided by starch, glucose or fructose (n = 8 per diet). Animals were then subjected to a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp to determine peripheral insulin sensitivity. After a 7 -month diet treatment, all groups had substantial increases in body weight (from 36. 02 ± 0. 85 to 63. 33 ± 0. 81 kg; P< 0. 0001), regardless of the diet. All groups presented similar insulin sensitivity index (ISI = 1. 39 ± 0. 10 mL min- 1 μUI kg).

40|$|AbstractSelenium (Se) {{has been}} implicated as a {{micronutrient}} that decreases adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and may increase diabetes risk by reducing insulin sensitivity.

Male FVB mice were divided into groups receiving either a control diet with minimal IF (low IF) or an HIF diet.

After 5 months, mice receiving SMSC had elevated fasting glucose (P <. 05) and a tendency for glucose intolerance (P =. 08). The increase in dietary IF did not result in improved fasting blood glucose.

The gene expression profiles of human carotids with advanced atherosclerosis obtained at autopsy and at vascular surgery were studied by microarray analysis. Expression analysis was performed both at the single gene (Rosetta, Gene Ontology) and at the pathway level using Ingenuity and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. In addition, mRNA and protein expression levels were validated using quantitative (q) RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry on unrelated advanced carotid lesions from autopsy and surgery. Microarray analysis indicated that the 97. 2 % of genes showed similar expression levels in advanced atherosclerotic lesions from autopsy and surgery. While the expression data revealed no differences in common atherosclerotic related pathways such as lipid metabolism and inflammation, the differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in <b>basal</b> cell <b>metabolism</b> and hypoxia driven pathways. qRT-PCR confirmed the differential expression of hypoxia-driven genes VEGF-A (2. 3 -fold upward arrow), glucose transporter (GLUT) - 1 (2. 5 -fold upward arrow), GLUT 3 (8. 3 -fold upward arrow), and hexokinase 1 (2. 4 -fold upward arrow) in autopsy vs. surgical specimens.

40|$|Published online 26 October 2017 Caspase- 2 {{has been}} shown to be {{involved}} in metabolic homeostasis. Here, we show that caspase- 2 deficiency alters <b>basal</b> energy <b>metabolism</b> by shifting the balance in fuel choice from fatty acid to carbohydrate usage. At 4 weeks of age, whole-body carbohydrate utilisation was increased in Casp 2 -/- mice and was maintained into adulthood. By 17 weeks of age, Casp 2 -/- mice had reduced white adipose mass, smaller white adipocytes decreased fasting blood glucose and plasma triglycerides but maintained normal insulin levels. When placed on a 12 -week high-fat diet (HFD), Casp 2 -/- mice resisted the development of obesity, fatty liver, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. In addition, HFD-fed Casp 2 -/- mice had reduced white adipocyte hypertrophy, apoptosis and expansion of both subcutaneous and visceral adipose depots. Increased expression of UCP 1 and the maintenance of adiponectin levels in white adipose tissue of HFD-fed Casp 2 -/- mice indicated increased browning and adipocyte hyperplasia. We found that while the preference for whole-body carbohydrate utilisation was maintained, HFD-fed Casp 2 -/- mice were not impaired in their ability to switch to utilising fats as a fuel source. Our findings suggest that caspase- 2 impacts <b>basal</b> energy <b>metabolism</b> by regulating adipocyte biology and fat expansion, most likely via a non-apoptotic function. Furthermore, we show that caspase- 2 deficiency shifts the balance in fuel choice towards increased carbohydrate utilisation and propose that this is due to mild energy stress. As a consequence, Casp 2 -/- mice show an adaptive remodelling of adipose tissue that protects from HFD-induced obesity and improves glucose homeostasis while paradoxically increasing their susceptibility to oxidative stress induced damage and premature ageing.
