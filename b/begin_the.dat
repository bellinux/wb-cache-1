5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) (AMW) fought Triple X (Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper) (XXX) in an Elimination Last Team Standing {{match in}} the next encounter.

Daniels pinned Storm following hitting him in the knee with a steel chair to <b>begin</b> <b>the</b> ten count, which Storm failed to make. Daniels was the second to be eliminated, failing to reach the ten count after being pinned following a top rope legdrop by Harris. With the outcome of the match down to the competition between Harris and Skipper, Harris hit Skipper with the Catatonic onto a steel chair. Harris then pinned Skipper to <b>begin</b> <b>the</b> ten count; Skipper did not get to his feet, giving the win to AMW.|$|E
