The pictures also showed a four-cylinder engine with a heat-wrapped turbocharger. Speculation on potential engines for the new coupe ranged from the turbocharged four-cylinder pictured to the Tau V8 that Hyundai had developed for the luxury-oriented Genesis.|$|R
40|$|The typical {{study of}} wage {{differentials}} examines workers at all educational levels and attends {{closely to the}} link between education and wages. Little research has looked at determinants of wage differentials specifically among workers with low educational attainment. This study, using the 1998 - 2002 <b>Bay</b> Area <b>Longitudinal</b> Surveys and the 2001 - 2003 Occupational Information Network, examines which skills and labor market institutions affected wages in jobs for individuals {{with a high school}} education or less and little work experience. The author finds that jobs demanding office/clerical skills, mechanical skills, or the 2 ̆ 2 new basic 2 ̆ 2 skills of reading, math, problem-solving, and communication paid higher wages, on average, than did other low-skill jobs, especially those in which physical skills were relatively important. Also positively associated with wages for these low-skilled workers were union representation and location in an industry containing relatively few low-skill jobs...|$|R
40|$|This study {{argues that}} a multidimensional health benefit offer (i. e., offers of medical, dental, sick leave, or vision benefits) and the hours or tenure {{restrictions}} placed on it {{are affected by the}} relative demand for workers in the local labor market. Using the <b>Bay</b> Area <b>Longitudinal</b> Surveys (BALS), a database of low-skilled jobs, we show that an excess labor demand for workers' skills increases the firm's offer of health benefits and reduces the restrictions on them, while an excess labor supply increases restrictions. These findings suggest that research assessing the correlation between wages, skills, and whether or not a firm offers health insurance might understate the plight of the low-skilled worker since health care access may also be restricted by a failure to receive an array of health benefits and by the restrictions placed on the offer. Furthermore, public policies might place the issues of uninsurance of low-wage workers {{within the context of a}} lack of marketable skills since low-skilled workers might be able to enhance their ability to secure jobs that offer an array of health benefits if they acquire skills in short supply in the local labor market.

40|$|The {{computer}} program POSTOP developed {{to serve as}} an aid in the analysis and sizing of stiffened composite panels that may be loaded in the postbuckling regime, is intended for the preliminary design of metal or composite panels with open-section stiffeners, subjected to multiple combined biaxial compression (or tension), shear and normal pressure load cases. Longitudinal compression, however, is assumed to be the dominant loading. Temperature, initial bow eccentricity and load eccentricity effects are included. The panel geometry is assumed to be repetitive over several <b>bays</b> in the <b>longitudinal</b> (stiffener) direction {{as well as in the}} transverse direction. Analytical routines are included to compute panel stiffnesses, strains, local and panel buckling loads, and skin/stiffener interface stresses. The resulting program is applicable to stiffened panels as commonly used in fuselage, wing, or empennage structures. The capabilities and limitations of the code are described. Instructions required to use the program and several example problems are included...|$|R

Originally, they retained DLR colours and were limited to route U11, but after a further modification programme started in 2005 trains are appearing in a yellow livery and are used on all routes.|$|R
2500|$|The Bodensee, {{designed}} by Paul Jaray, had an innovative hull shape of relatively low fineness ratio, (ratio of length to diameter). This was arrived at after wind-tunnel tests {{conducted at the}} University of Göttingen had shown that this would significantly reduce drag. [...] The framework consisted of eleven 17-sided main transverse frames with a secondary ring frame in each <b>bay,</b> connected by <b>longitudinal</b> girders [...] with a stiffening keel. [...] The forward-mounted control car was combined with the passenger accommodation and was constructed {{as an integral part}} of the hull structure rather than being suspended beneath it. [...] Passenger accommodation consisted of five compartments seating four people and a VIP cabin for one. An additional six passengers could be carried on wicker chairs in the gangway between the compartments. A galley and toilets were also fitted. It was powered by four [...] Maybach Mb.IVa engines, two in a centrally mounted aft gondola driving a single [...] diameter two-bladed pusher propeller, the other two in a pair of amidships engine cars mounted either side of the hull. These drove [...] two-bladed propellers via a reversing gearbox to enable reverse thrust for manoeuvering when landing.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decades, {{there have been}} cases where {{buildings}} {{around the world have}} experienced partial or total collapse under extreme abnormal loading conditions. Although building collapse is a rare event, it may result in significant catastrophes and property loss when it occurs. In particular, the collapse of the World Trade Center in 2001 following the terrorist attacks has triggered increased interest in blast and progressive collapse resistant building design. The upgrading of steel frames building has thus become an important topic for researchers. In this study, progressive collapse response was investigated using the Alternate Path Method (APM) recommended in the United States' General Service Administration (GSA 2003) and Department of Defense (DoD 2005) guidelines. Nonlinear dynamic analysis for progressive collapse is done as a precise tool for evaluation of the progressive collapse potential of building structures. The studied models were 18 typical floors, with 6 <b>bays</b> in the <b>longitudinal</b> direction, 3 <b>bays</b> in the transverse direction, where six cases of removed column scenarios were conducted. The objectives of this study are to 1) investigate the effect of three retrofit strategies (by increasing strength and/or stiffness of the beams) on the response of steel frames for model of span 6 m (reference model) subjected to GSA and DoD loads by studying three parameters (the chord rotation, tie forces and displacement ductility demand), 2) investigate the effect of variation of bay span on the three performance parameters by studying three models of different spans of 5. 0, 7. 5 and 9. 0 m subjected to GSA load, and 3) propose equations for predicting the effect of retrofit strategy and bay span on the three performance indicator...|$|R
40|$|Povodom nedavno dovršenih radova temeljite obnove kora splitske katedrale donose se nedovoljno poznati detalji vezani uz gradnju, arhitektonska analiza i vrednovanje te dugo za nemarene i podcijenjene građevine. Objavljuje se niz starijih kamenih i mramornih ulomaka, pronađenih tijekom sanacije. Od njih su najznačajniji dijel ovi crkvenog namještaja kojima se upotpunjuju saznanja o srednjovjekovnim transformacijama katedrale. Uređenjem unutrašnjosti kora ponovo su došle do punog izražaja vrijednosti te značajne umjetničke cjeline. Pri tome su vraćene korske klupe u položaj koji su imale u 17. stoljeću i tako ponovo usklađene s baroknom arhitekturom koja im je bila prilagođena. The {{main reason}} for the {{construction}} of the choir of Split Cathedral was the lack of room in the ancient building, which had over the course of years become increasingly cramped. The apostolic visitor of 1579 Agostino Valier found that laymen and canons sat squeezed cheek by jowl on the choir stalls in the narrow space before the main altar, and ordered that the church be enlarged. When in 1615 Archbishop Marco Antonio de Dominis finally built a new choir and placed the old stalls in it, he at the same time realised the ancient wish for the expansion of the cathedral and completed the long process of opening up the presbytery, that is, bringing the Eucharistic sacrament closer to the commons in the nave. De Dominis managed with very modest resources to build a new choir, although {{at the beginning of the}} 17 th century the economic state of affairs in the town and in the archdiocese was crippling, the plague epidemic of 1608 having almost wiped out the population. This is a situation that certainly has to be borne in mind when assessing the value of this Baroque building. So far it has usually been repeated that it is modest, unprepossessing, even ugly, and the whole operation described as inconsiderate damage to and uglification of valuable ancient architecture. Here we shall attempt to show that the Baroque choir of Split Cathedral is not only significant in an architectural and artistic sense, but that the builders, in the given circumstances, certainly paid a great deal of attention to the values they found already present. Archbishop Markantun de Dominis had to fit into the new building of his choir the wooden backs of the choir stalls, in the form in which in the 15 th century they had already been set up in the presbytery. The architecture of the Baroque choir was thus adjusted to the old choir stalls, and the lower part of the walls is completely plain and unrelieved, the level of the first stone cornice being determined by the height of the stalls. On the same wooden dais between the two wings of the stalls, in the centre of the eastern wall, very likely during the time of Archbishop Sforza Ponzoni, a wooden throne was set up, the work of a Venetian workshop. The central zone of the walls of the choir is relieved with stone pilasters featuring Ionian capitals, between which flat fields were left for the accommodation of large paintings with scenes from the life and martyrdom of St Domnius [Dujam] painted in 1683 - 1685 by Pietro Ferrari according to a commission by the then archbishop, Stefano Cosmi. In the western bays of the side walls there were balconies supported on stone corbels, as documented in the drawings of V. Andric (1582) and E. Hebrard (1912). The floors of the balconies made of great stone slabs were placed on these corbels, slabs which had been obtained by sawing the architraves in part of the peristyle of Diocletian 2 ̆ 7 s Mausoleum, from which the colonnade had been removed when the choir was built on. On a southern balcony the choir sang on very solemn occasions, and on the northern balcony an organ might have been placed. In the upper part of the choir 2 ̆ 7 s walls were nine oval windows bordered with stone frames that had been carved out of the slabs of the stone coffered ceiling of the peristyle, which is shown from the remains of the shallow moulding visible on 303 the external sides of the windows. The Baroque wooden gilt chandelier is extant, and above it, on a chain, a wooden relief of the dove of the Holy Spirit is affixed to the ceiling. The interior of the choir is as a whole fairly modest, with a simple volume, and relieved with a restrained classical architectural vocabulary. However, while judging the artistic value of the architecture, we nevertheless have to bear in mind the very difficult conditions in which it was created, which meant that it was built entirely of material to hand (stone from parts of the Mausoleum and the houses knocked down where the choir was built). The builder of the choir, within the slender opportunities available to him, coped very well, and thus we can point to the confidently proportioned volume of the whole and individual walls, based on the square and the golden section rectangle. The choir is adeptly fitted into the tissue of the buildings that already stood. Since it was surrounded on all sides with houses, it was raised far enough above them for the oval windows to be opened up in the upper zone of the walls, thus obtaining the necessary daylight. In this manner a large wall surface was left untouched for the placing of paintings, and the typical Baroque lighting from above was obtained. On the northern fa 9 ade, a drawing incised in the plaster is retained, the ground for a painting from the 17 th century that shows a trompe l 2 ̆ 7 oeil architectural composition. After the fire of the old archbishop 2 ̆ 7 s palace in 1924 and its demolition, a view was opened up onto the choir that was not originally provided for and led substantially to its aesthetic downgrading. Archbishops and canons were buried in the choir. The central tomb, facing the archiepiscopal throne, was commissioned by Sforza Ponzoni, the same archbishop that completed the arrangement of the choir. In research at the end of 1998 a coffin was found with a complete skeleton and below it the commingled bones of at least five more archbishops. After that, in archaeological probes of the pavement of the choir, a part of the front side of an antique stone sarcophagus was discovered, with an inscription and a depiction of a dolphin, a fragment of a limestone beam decorated with interwoven arcades of two stranded bands and three marble items of medieval church furnishings- two slabs and one beam of the choir screen. The slabs have characteristic ornamentation of two crosses, each under an arch, flanked with palmettes and rosettes. Because of the absence of any interlacing decoration they can be dated early, to the 81 h and 91 h centuries. The beam has a carved inscription mentioning St John the Baptist, and it can be assumed that it came into the choir from the nearby baptistery. Stone fragments have been found in the walls: a large Corinthian capital from one of the ancient columns of the peristyle, parts of the door and window frames from houses or ruins that stood where the choir now is, and two fragments of stone pre-Romanesque ecclesiastical furnishing- a small roughly worked stylised Corinthian capital of a pilaster and part of the ciborium of an altar with a relief of stylised birds. North east of the choir, on the site of the demolished archbishop 2 ̆ 7 s palace complex, a Roman mosaic has been discovered; in 1968 - 1972 archaeological revision work was carried out. After this the foundations of the choir were not conserved and subsequently gave way because water penetrated behind them, forcing the banked material outwards. This seriously compromised the structural stability of the choir, which was anyway constructed of relatively poor material. The walls 304 of the choir are founded partly on the firm footing of the massive base of the peristyle of the mausoleum, and partially on a substrate of heterogeneous material. All this led to the subsidence of the foundations and the cracking of the walls. In conservation works started in 1999, the foundations of the choir were injected, and then through the dozen metres long horizontal boreholes below the choir, steel rods were inserted to pull the foundation walls together. The walls were grouted with a lime-based mixture, and the most damaged portions were rebuilt. Tie rods were placed at three levels. The dilapidated roof construction was replaced with a new one, and the floor of the attic was made with three layers of boards, providing a brace against earthquakes. The remains of the one-time fresco on the northern wall was made good by mortar filleting and grouting, and the remains of the drawing incised into the plaster, previously hardly visible, were picked out with lime mortar, and now can be seen from a distance. The Baroque gilt wooden chandelier was restored. The restored wooden archiepiscopal throne was put back in the choir, as well as two of the six large paintings by Ferrari. The Gothic crucifix was put back above the throne and thus the composition of the eastern wall of the choir was rounded off. In the western <b>bays</b> of the <b>longitudinal</b> walls, which were empty after the suspended balcony of a recent date had been removed; six Ponzoni 2 ̆ 7 s paintings have been hung. The choir stalls were restored to their 17 th century form. The fragments of medieval church furnishing found during the conservation works were placed on the free part of the northern wall of the choir. Here a kind of little stone collection has been created, bearing witness to the complex history of the cathedral and the many vicissitudes experienced by its interior...|$|R
