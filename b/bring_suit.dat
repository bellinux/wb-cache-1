5|$|In 1962, Mrs. Jill Winkler Rath, {{widow of}} {{publicist}} Otto Winkler, filed a $100,000 {{lawsuit against the}} $2,000,000 estate of Clark Gable in connection with Winkler's death in the plane crash with Carole Lombard. The suit was dismissed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Mrs. Rath, in her action, claimed Gable promised to provide financial aid for her if she would not <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> against the airline involved. Mrs. Rath stated she later learned that Gable settled his claim against the airline for $10. He did so {{because he did not}} want to repeat his grief in court and subsequently provided her no financial aid in his will.|$|E
5|$|When questioned, Patrick Darby {{testified that}} in 1824, Beauchamp had {{solicited}} his services {{in order to}} <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> against Sharp for unspecified charges. During their ensuing conversations, Beauchamp had related the story of Sharp's abandonment of Anna Cooke and her child, swearing that he would kill him one day, {{even if he had}} to come to Frankfort and shoot him down in the street. The combined testimonies of Eliza Sharp and Patrick Darby were sufficient to persuade the city magistrates to hold Beauchamp for trial during the circuit court's next term, which began in March 1826.|$|E
25|$|Justice Scalia concurred {{with the}} majority, but wrote {{separately}} {{to note that}} Ideal's alleged 1962(c) injury was not within the zone of interests protected by the RICO cause of action and so Ideal did not have standing to <b>bring</b> <b>suit.</b>|$|E

25|$|Based on {{replacement}} cost {{of those who}} leave {{as a result of}} being bullied or witnessing bullying, Rayner and Keashly (2004) estimated that for an organization of 1,000 people, the cost would be $1.2 million US. This estimate did not include the cost of litigation should victims <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> against the organization.|$|E
25|$|A complainant's {{right to}} <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is not {{confined}} to charges as to which the EEOC has made a reasonable-cause finding, and the District Court's error in holding to the contrary was not harmless since the issues raised with respect to 703 (a) (1) were not identical to those with respect to 704 (a) and the dismissal of the former charge may have prejudiced respondent's efforts at trial.|$|E
25|$|In April 2002, the Seminole Freedmen's {{suit against}} the {{government}} was dismissed in federal district court; the court ruled the Freedmen could not <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> independently of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, which refused to join. They appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which in June 2004 affirmed that the Seminole Freedmen could not sue {{the federal government for}} inclusion in the settlement without the Seminole Nation joining. As a sovereign nation, they could not be ordered to join the suit.|$|E
50|$|Very little {{case law}} exists in Nevis, which many {{attorneys}} interpret {{to mean that}} creditors are effectively deterred from <b>bringing</b> <b>suit</b> in Nevis.

25|$|Further, Arar filed a claim {{under the}} Torture Victims Protection Act, {{adopted by the}} United States Congress in 1992, which allows a victim of torture by an {{individual}} of a foreign government to <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> against that actor in a US court. Arar's claim under the act against Ashcroft and the INS directors is based upon their complicity in bringing about the torture he suffered. The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.|$|E
25|$|In 1824 the City of New York {{attempted}} to assert a jurisdictional monopoly over the growing steam ferry service in New York Harbor in Gibbons v. Ogden. It was deemed {{by the court}} that interstate transport would be regulated by the federal government. This did not resolve the border issue. In 1830, New Jersey planned to <b>bring</b> <b>suit,</b> but the matter was resolved with a compact between the states ratified by US Congress in 1834 which set the boundary line between them as {{the midpoint of the}} shared waterways. This was later confirmed by the US Supreme Court in a 1908 case which also expounded on the compact.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1930s, the Seminole Freedmen have {{struggled}} with cycles of exclusion from the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma. In 1990, the tribe received {{the majority of}} a $46 million judgement trust by the United States, for seizure of lands in Florida in 1823, and the Freedmen have worked to gain a share of it. In 2004 the US Supreme Court ruled the Seminole Freedmen could not <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> without the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, which refused to join it on the claim issue. In 2000 the Seminole Nation voted to restrict membership to those who could prove descent from a Seminole Indian on the Dawes Rolls of the early 20th century, which excluded about 1,200 Freedmen who were previously included as members. They argue that the Dawes Rolls were inaccurate and often classified persons with both Seminole and African ancestry as only Freedmen.|$|E

40|$|The Supreme Court {{determined}} that a North Carolina statute of repose barred plaintiffs from <b>bringing</b> <b>suit</b> against CTS Corporation for contamination that occurred on land CTS owned 24 years earlier. The Court found that CERCLA preempts state statutes of limitations {{in order to allow}} plaintiffs’ claims to accrue when the injury is caused by contamination that has a long latency period. However, the Court also decided that CERLCA does not preempt state statutes of repose because Congress did not specifically preempt them as they did with statutes of limitations, thus; enforcing statutes of repose was not found to frustrate the purpose of CERCLA. Although plaintiffs did not discover the contamination until 22 years after it occurred, they nonetheless failed to bring their claim within the 10 years required by the North Carolina statute and were barred from <b>bringing</b> <b>suit...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Delaware Supreme Court {{disagreed}} with this standard. The court rejected the good faith standard {{due to the}} danger of <b>bringing</b> <b>suit</b> simply to reveal identity without any intention of pursuing the defamation action to a final decision.

25|$|For {{his playing}} company, Farrant {{combined}} his Windsor {{children with the}} Children of the Chapel Royal, then directed by William Hunnis. On Farrant's death in 1580, Hunnis took on John Newman as a partner and they subleased the property from Farrant's widow, putting up a ₤100 bond on the promise to promptly pay the rent and to make needed repairs. But the venture did not go well financially, which put Farrant's widow in jeopardy of defaulting on the rent to More. In November 1583, Farrant brought suit against Hunnis and Newman for default on the bond. To escape a suit by her or More, Hunnis and Newman transferred their sublease to Henry Evans, a Welsh scrivener and theatrical affectionado. This unauthorised assignment of the sublease gave More an excuse to <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> to retake possession of the property, but Evans used legal delays and finally escaped legal action by selling the sublease to Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, sometime after Michaelmas Term (November) of 1583, who then gave it to his secretary, the writer John Lyly.|$|E

5000|$|The New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, affirmed in 2006 the {{intermediate}} court's decision to deny Langan standing as surviving [...] "spouse", thus blocking Langan from <b>bringing</b> <b>suit</b> against St. Vincent's Hospital.

40|$|In 1998, a U. S. {{district}} {{court held that}} the imposition of the coal excise tax, or black lung excise tax, on coal destined for export was unconstitutional. The process of refunding the tax has been controversial. This is because some coal producers and exporters have attempted to bypass the limitations in the Internal Revenue Code's refund scheme for <b>bringing</b> <b>suit</b> under the Export Clause in the Court of Federal Claims, seeking damages from the United States in the amount of coal excise taxes paid. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals held the court had jurisdiction under the Tucker Act to hear the suits and allowed them {{as an alternative to the}} Code's refund process. However, in a 2008 decision, United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining Co., the Supreme Court unanimously held that taxpayers must comply with the Code's administrative refund process before <b>bringing</b> <b>suit.</b> Meanwhile, H. R. 1762 and S. 373 would provide an alternative method for taxpayers to receive coal excise tax refunds...|$|R
500|$|However, others {{noted that}} if Disney had {{attempted}} to block the film's release, it was unclear on what legal grounds it could be done. Moore took care to avoid direct copyright infringement of songs or films played as part of attractions, and intellectual property law is less clear on the {{other aspects of the}} film. Science fiction writer Cory Doctorow, who distributed his first novel, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, set in a 22nd-century Disney World, under a Creative Commons license, believes there's at most [...] "a possible trademark claim, and I suppose that Disney could conceivabl <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> for violating the park's terms of use, but these are much harder cases to make than copyright." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the second}} hearing, on June 23, the Secretary took the {{position}} that the Nonintercourse Act did apply to the Maine (and the original states), but that it only applied to federally recognized tribes. The Secretary also argued that filing a lawsuit would damage relations between {{the federal government and the}} state of Maine. When Judge Gignoux pointed out that Maine's governor and entire Congressional delegation had called on the Secretary to <b>bring</b> <b>suit,</b> U.S. Attorney for Maine Peter Mills (who was with Wittman at the counsel's table) declared that [...] "he, too, wanted the government to bring suit"causing laughter in the courtroom. After a recess, Judge Gignoux issued a preliminary order requiring the Secretary to file the lawsuit.|$|E
500|$|Third, the Court {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} the federal government could not <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> on behalf of the tribe. Fourth, the Court {{rejected the}} statute limiting the time in which the government could challenge the validity of its land patents, holding that did not apply to suits on behalf of Indians. Fifth, the Court rejected estoppel: [...] "Since these Indians with the implied consent of the government had acquired such rights of occupancy as entitled them to retain possession as against the defendants, no officer or agent of the government had authority to deal with the land upon any other theory." [...] Finally, however, the Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's voiding of the entire patents, holding that only the portions possessed by the Indians should be void.|$|E
5|$|The Seneca Nation {{could not}} have brought the lawsuit until 1845, when the New York {{legislature}} granted the nation the right to <b>bring</b> <b>suits</b> in courts of law and equity.

This petition was ignored by the BIA.|$|R
50|$|The False Claims Act {{provides}} {{incentive to}} relators by granting them between 15% and 25% of any award or settlement amount. In addition, the statute provides an award of the relator's attorneys' fees, making qui tam actions a popular topic for the plaintiff's bar. An individual <b>bringing</b> <b>suit</b> pro se—that is, without {{the representation of}} a lawyer—may not bring a qui tam action under the False Claims Act.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, Baum joined {{members of}} the Green Party, lawyers, a {{journalist}} and a doctor in <b>bringing</b> <b>suits</b> against Germany’s 2009 antiterrorism law before the Federal Constitutional Court, arguing that covert surveillance, particularly in private homes and in the intimacy of bedrooms or bathrooms, could entangle innocent third parties.

500|$|The Sherman Antitrust Act {{was enacted}} in 1890 {{to oppose the}} use of combinations, {{monopolies}} or cartels that harmed free and open trade. [...] It prohibited the restraint of trade. [...] The Clayton Antitrust Act was enacted in 1914 to address shortcomings discovered in the Sherman Act. [...] It specified the prohibited conduct, an enforcement scheme, and remedial measures. [...] The Clayton Act allows for private parties to <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> for treble damages and for injunctive relief. [...] From 1922 (when Federal Baseball Club v.

500|$|On October 17, 2008, in Brunner v. Ohio Republican Party, 07A332, the United States Supreme Court {{overturned}} the 6th Circuit Decision requiring Brunner to provide lists of improperly registered voters to each county election board. [...] The ruling means that Brunner can instruct the 88 county boards of elections to ignore public record requests by the Ohio Republican Party made to challenge registrants with information mismatched between their registration and their driver's license or social security number. [...] The Republican Party {{claimed that the}} ruling {{was based on a}} technicality rather than the merits of the arguments. [...] Bennett said that [...] "The justices did not disagree with our argument that Jennifer Brunner has failed to comply with federal election law. [...] They merely said we don't have a right to bring a private challenge against her under this particular provision." [...] The McCain-Palin campaign said [...] "...the United States Supreme Court does not address violations of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) by Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner. Rather, the Court ruled that Congress had likely not authorized private individuals or political parties to <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> under the section of HAVA requiring voter registration verification through data-matching." [...] Since the ruling did not directly address the issues that the Republicans wanted determined, they filed a similar case in the Ohio Supreme Court. [...] However, they withdrew the case.|$|E
500|$|Their {{relationship}} {{began to}} break down over the question of railroad regulation. [...] The President in 1905 sought legislation to give the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) the power to set freight rates; Foraker considered the proposed law unconstitutional, and introduced a bill by which the railroad would set the rates, and if the ICC found they were excessive, it could ask the Attorney General to <b>bring</b> <b>suit.</b> [...] Foraker spoke repeatedly against the administration-favored bill as it moved through the Senate, {{and was one of}} only three senators (and the only Republican) to oppose the resulting Hepburn Act on final Senate passage. [...] As the Ohio legislature had passed a resolution urging Foraker and Dick to vote for the bill, he faced anger at home; one newspaper wrote that Foraker had extinguished his chances of becoming president with his vote. [...] The following year, Foraker also broke with the administration on the question of statehood for Arizona Territory and New Mexico Territory, feeling that the two territories should not be combined into one state unless a merger was approved in referenda. [...] Foraker's position prevailed in Congress; despite his stance, Roosevelt signed the resulting bill. [...] The two men also differed on issues of patronage, and on a series of treaties requiring Senate ratification that allowed for international agreements without the need for Senate approval. [...] Roosevelt wrote to a friend that Foraker seemed determine to fight him on every point, good or bad.|$|E
50|$|Questions {{of reform}} have {{circulated}} around whether to introduce US style treble damages as added deterrent against competition law violaters. The recent Modernisation Regulation 1/2003 {{has meant that}} the European Commission no longer has a monopoly on enforcement, and that private parties may <b>bring</b> <b>suits</b> in national courts. Hence, there has been debate over the legitimacy of private damages actions in traditions that shy from imposing punitive measures in civil actions.|$|R
5000|$|Criminal {{enforcement}} is largely private in Ancient Rome; unlike today, {{there is no}} public system of enforcement, such as a prosecuting attorney ostensibly bringing a case {{on behalf of the}} community (e.g., People vs. _______, or Crown vs. ________.) For instance, Celer confesses to murder in the gallery, before several witnesses, but the judge states that he has no authority to try Celer unless another citizen <b>brings</b> <b>suit</b> against him.|$|R
25|$|Finally, {{the federal}} {{government}} may <b>bring</b> <b>suits</b> against states {{on behalf of the}} tribes in its guardian capacity, as it historically has. Similarly, tribes may intervene in suits brought by {{the federal government}} (or the federal government may intervene in suits brought by the tribes) against states. This exception is rather narrow, and states may assert sovereign immunity where tribes assert different claims, or ask for different relief, than the federal government.|$|R
