5|$|In 1954 Hamling {{started a}} {{companion}} magazine, Imaginative Tales; in addition, his company Greenleaf Publishing was {{the publisher of}} Rogue, a men's magazine modelled after Playboy. In 1957 the liquidation of American News Company, a major distributor, meant that many magazines had to scramble to find new distributors. Independent distributors often required that the magazines be monthly, and that they be in a larger format than the digest-size common in science fiction magazines. The larger format required higher revenue to be profitable, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> it proved impossible to attract the additional advertising income that would have kept the magazines afloat. By the end of 1958, many titles had disappeared as a result, with Imagination one of the victims; Hamling closed down both Imagination and its sister magazine to invest the money in Rogue instead. The last issue of Imagination was October 1958, the 63rd issue, while Imaginative Tales, retitled Space Travel, ceased with the November 1958 issue. There was no indication in either magazine that the end had come, though the last issue of Imagination omitted its letter, book review and pen-pal columns, all of which had appeared regularly in prior issues.|$|E
5|$|Scuba diving {{fatalities}} have a {{major financial}} impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs. Equipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba, and when {{the cause of death}} is recorded as drowning, it is usually the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events in which drowning is the endpoint because it occurred in water, while the initial cause remains unknown. Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, often as a consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent, occasionally aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research which could improve diver safety.|$|E

25|$|The {{images on}} coins {{initially}} changed rapidly, but increasingly each community {{settled on a}} single image or set of images.

50|$|It is {{well known}} in {{elementary}} geometry that certain geometrical constructions are simpler than certain others. <b>But</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>case</b> {{it turns out that the}} apparent simplicity of a construction does not consist in the practical execution of the construction, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> the brevity of the statement of what has to be done. Can then any objective criterion be laid down by which an estimate may be formed of the relative simplicity of several different constructions for attaining the same end? Lemoine developed the ideas of geometrography to answer this question.|$|R
50|$|Personal infinitive in -r(e). This has {{the same}} endings as the future subjunctive <b>but</b> differs <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> because the {{personal}} infinitive always uses the infinitive stem while the future subjunctive uses the past-tense stem.|$|R

25|$|In this model, {{patients}} {{may still be}} treated at the scene up to the skill level of the attending crew, and subsequently transported to definitive care, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> the reduced skill set of the ambulance crew {{and the needs of}} the patient indicate a shorter interval for transport of the patient than is the case in the Franco-German model.|$|E
25|$|Some {{dynamical}} systems, {{like the}} one-dimensional logistic map defined by x → 4 x (1 – x), are chaotic everywhere, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> chaotic behavior is {{found only in}} a subset of phase space.

25|$|One more {{issue is}} that some complex {{instructions}} are difficult to restart, e.g. following a page fault. In some cases, restarting from the beginning will work (although wasteful), <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> this would give incorrect results. Therefore, the machine needs to have some hidden state to remember which parts went through and what remains to be done.

Workers occasionally will remove both liquid and solid feces, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> the workers will consume the liquid feces but leave behind the solids. Occasionally, workers will feed the liquid to the larvae after drinking up the wastes. Sanitation behaviors are seen at a decreased rate during periods of colony decline.|$|E
25|$|Organisms of {{many species}} are {{specialized}} into {{male and female}} varieties, each known as a sex, with some falling in between being intersex. Sexual reproduction involves the combining and mixing of genetic traits: specialized cells known as gametes combine to form offspring that inherit traits from each parent. Gametes can be identical in form and function (known as isogamy), <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> an asymmetry has evolved such that two sex-specific types of gametes (heterogametes) exist (known as anisogamy).|$|E
25|$|As {{can be seen}} above, many {{of these}} drivers and TSRs could be {{considered}} practically essential to the full-featured operation of the system. <b>But</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> a choice {{had to be made}} by the computer user, to decide whether to be able to run certain standard DOS programs or have all their favorite drivers and TSRs loaded. Loading the entire list shown above is likely either impractical or impossible, if the user also wants to run a standard DOS program as well.|$|E
40|$|The high {{frequency}} of contact allergy to gold {{in patients with}} dermatitis was established after exhaustive skin testing, determining the right test agent, the best concentration, and repeated test readings. Metallic gold in contact with skin is slowly ionized, permitting absorption and haptenisation. Contact allergy to gold is statistically correlated {{to the presence of}} dental gold. <b>But</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>case</b> reports it has also been attributed to wearing gold jewellery, albeit not statistically demonstrated. Epicutaneous testing with gold salts increases the blood gold level, and by intramuscular injection systemic contact dermatitis is provoked in an allergic individual.

25|$|The {{number of}} people {{practicing}} Igbo religion decreased drastically in the 20th century with the influx of Christian missionaries {{under the auspices of}} the British colonial government of Nigeria. In some cases Igbo traditional religion was syncretised with Christianity, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> indigenous rites were demonised by Christian missionaries who pointed out the practice of human sacrifice and some other cultural practices that were illegal under the colonial government. Earlier missionaries referred to many indigenous religious practices as juju.

25|$|Animal {{and human}} studies and {{clinical}} experience {{back up the}} contention that morphine {{is one of the}} most euphoric drugs known, and via all but the IV route heroin and morphine cannot be distinguished according to studies because heroin is a prodrug for the delivery of systemic morphine. Chemical changes to the morphine molecule yield other euphorigenics such as dihydromorphine, hydromorphone (Dilaudid, Hydal), and oxymorphone (Numorphan, Opana), as well as the latter three's methylated equivalents dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone, respectively; in addition to heroin, there are dipropanoylmorphine, diacetyldihydromorphine, and other members of the 3,6 morphine diester category like nicomorphine and other similar semi-synthetic opiates like desomorphine, hydromorphinol, etc. used clinically in many countries of the world <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> also produced illicitly in rare instances.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} what is {{generally considered to be}} a Swedish king appears in Tacitus' work Germania, c. 100 AD (the king of the Suiones). However, due to scant and unreliable sources before the 11th century, lists of succession traditionally start in the 10th century with king Olof Skötkonung, and his father Eric the Victorious, who also were the first Swedish kings to be baptized. There are, however, lists of Swedish pagan monarchs with far older dates, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> these kings appear in sources of disputed historical reliability. These records notably deal with the legendary House of Yngling, and based on the Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus, Eric the Victorious and Olof Skötkonung have often been classified as belonging to the Swedish house of Ynglings, tracing them back to Sigurd Ring and Ragnar Lodbrok (whom Saxo considered to belong to the House of Yngling). However, according to Icelandic sources this line of kings was broken (see Ingjald and Ivar Vidfamne). As {{there is no evidence that}} Eric and Olof ever used the Yngling name themselves, modern historians instead refer to their family as the House of Munsö, the Old Dynasty or the House of Uppsala.|$|E

40|$|Randomness is both {{a useful}} way to model natural systems and {{a useful tool for}} {{engineered}} systems, e. g. in computation, communication and control. Fully random transformations require exponential time for either classical or quantum systems, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>case</b> pseudorandom operations can emulate certain properties of truly random ones. Indeed in the classical realm there is by now a well-developed theory of such pseudorandom operations. However the construction of such objects turns out to be much harder in the quantum case. Here we show that random quantum circuits are a powerful source of quantum pseudorandomness. This gives the {{for the first time a}} polynomialtime construction of quantum unitary designs, which can replace fully random operations in most applications, and shows that generic quantum dynamics cannot be distinguished from truly random processes. We discuss applications of our result to quantum information science, cryptography and to understanding self-equilibration of closed quantum dynamics. Comment: 6 pages, 1 figure.
