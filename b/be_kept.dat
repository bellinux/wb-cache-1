5|$|The museum {{stresses}} that the paintings <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> {{in good condition}} by whoever has them. Museum director, Anne Hawley has stated that the works should <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> in a stable environment of 50% humidity and 70°F. Additionally, they should <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> away from light and stored in acid-free paper. Hawley also noted to avoid rolling the paintings, which will crack the paint. If these guidelines are not followed, the paintings could be damaged and drop in value. More repainting {{would need to be}} done too, which hurts the paintings' integrity.|$|E
