5|$|Marostica, {{regarded}} as a moderate Republican, focused heavily on fiscal issues as a legislator, including transparency and loosening budgetary restrictions, {{and sat on the}} legislature's Joint <b>Budget</b> <b>Committee</b> during the 2009 session. In July 2009, Marostica resigned from the legislature to accept the post of economic development director in the cabinet of Democratic Gov.

5|$|The {{political}} {{positions of}} Paul Ryan, the U.S. Representative from Wisconsin's 1st congressional district since 1999 and currently the 54th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, are generally conservative, {{with a focus}} on fiscal policy.

5|$|For the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Marostica {{was named}} to {{a seat on the}} legislature's Joint <b>Budget</b> <b>Committee,</b> and a seat on the House Appropriations Committee as the ranking Republican member. During hearings before the beginning of the legislative session, Marostica supported withdrawing all state funding from public research universities, a move opposed by university leaders, but which was discussed more seriously after poor economic forecasts. Marostica also helped to lead an effort to allow the state to tap the financial reserves of Pinnacol Assurance, a quasi-governmental worker's compensation insurer, in order to balance the state budget. Following the legislative session, Marostica served on Colorado's Long-Term Fiscal Stability Commission, a panel created by legislation during the 2009 General Assembly to consider changes to constitutional constraints on the state budget.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, Democratic {{governor}} Bill Ritter named Marostica, a Republican, to {{the post}} of {{executive director of the}} Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade, replacing Don Elliman, who Ritter had tapped as Colorado's chief operating officer. Marostica resigned his House seat to take the position, and handed control of his development company to his partner and son in order to avoid conflicts of interest, Marostica named opening Asian markets to Colorado exports as a priority for his time in the new position, in addition to encouraging new venture capital investment and retaining existing major employers despite the late-2000s recession. Marostica was replaced in the House by small business owner Brian DelGrosso, and on the legislature's Joint <b>Budget</b> <b>Committee</b> by the more conservative Rep. Kent Lambert.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Congress assumed {{a more active}} role in the federal budget process with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (CBA), legislation which created the House and Senate <b>Budget</b> <b>Committees.</b> during the first years of the CBA, these committees were effective in establishing the budget process. In 1981, they contributed to a dramatic shift in fiscal policy. Consequently, the budget process assumed a magnitude which was beyond the purview of a single set of committees. The remainder of decade was dominated by large coalitions of budget summits, obscuring the role of the <b>Budget</b> <b>Committees.</b> In the mid- 1980 's, concern over the deficit shifted the focus of the budget process further from the <b>budget</b> <b>Committees.</b> Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislated deficit totals and instituted the sequester to cut spending when Congress could not. The most recent revision of the budget process is the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (BEA), which further displaces the <b>Budget</b> <b>Committees.</b> Past trends suggest the BEA will be superseded by legislation which may further diminish the role of the Budget Committees[URL] United States Nav...|$|R
5|$|Several {{political}} changes preceded {{the passage of}} the settlement act. First, Senator Edmund Muskie (D-ME)who previously seemed supportive of a settlement, but was gaining national prominence on the issue of fiscal responsibility prior to the 1980 Democratic primarygave up his seat as Chairman of the Senate <b>Budget</b> <b>Committee</b> to accept President Carter's nomination for Secretary of State. Second, Governor Brennan's choice to replace Muskie (and thus inherit his predecessor's committee assignments) was George Mitchell (D-ME)who had supported the land claim as U.S. Attorney and possessed legal gravitas due to his tenure as a District Judge. Another factor affecting the final push for the settlement was the fear that, if Ronald Reagan won the 1980 presidential election, he would veto any settlement favorable toward the tribes.|$|E

5000|$|This {{is quite}} surprising, in a sense, given the {{partisan}} {{nature of the}} Congress. It is not necessarily that these partisans have embraced nonpartisanship as a positive end in itself, however. Rather, the <b>Budget</b> <b>Committees</b> (and especially their leadership and staff) have recognized that a weak CBO (one {{that does not have}} a reputation for objective analysis, and whose conclusions are viewed as partisan) is not in their interest. A weak CBO weakens the <b>Budget</b> <b>Committees,</b> and indeed weakens Congress as a whole in its inevitable battles with the executive over budget and economic policy.|$|R
