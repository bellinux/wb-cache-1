Virtually {{identical}} spherical <b>boulders,</b> called Koutu <b>Boulders,</b> are found on the beaches, in the cliffs, and beneath the surface inland of the shore of Hokianga Harbour, North Island, New Zealand, between Koutu and Kauwhare points. Like the Moeraki <b>Boulders,</b> the Koutu <b>Boulders</b> are large, reaching [...] in diameter, and almost spherical.|$|R
30|$|We {{assumed that}} the <b>boulders</b> were transported in rolling mode. However, if the <b>boulders</b> were transported in sliding mode, the {{required}} wave heights to move the <b>boulders</b> would be smaller than those with a return period of 50  years (Table  2). This suggests that the <b>boulders</b> could be moved by the small amplitude waves that have a return period of 50  years or less if the <b>boulders</b> were moved in sliding mode. In any case, the <b>boulders</b> could be transported by the storm waves with a return period of 50  years or less.|$|R

5|$|Bouldering {{can damage}} {{vegetation}} that grows on rocks, such as mosses and lichens. This can {{occur as a}} result of the climber intentionally cleaning the <b>boulder,</b> or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding the <b>boulder</b> can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down crash pads. Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails, or when they unearth small rocks near the <b>boulder</b> in an effort to make the landing zone safer. The repeated use of white climbing chalk can damage the rock surface of boulders and cliffs, particularly sandstone and other porous rock types, and the scrubbing of rocks to remove chalk can also degrade the rock surface. Other environmental concerns include littering, improperly disposed feces, and graffiti. These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering, as was the case in Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in Rocklands, South Africa.|$|E

30|$|Obviously, {{this does}} {{not rule out the}} {{occurrence}} of large paleo-tsunamis having struck Lanyu Island. However, the numerical simulations of the tsunamis generated by Mw 8.7 earthquakes from the Ryukyu Trench could not move most of the <b>boulders.</b> Moreover, storm waves could transport <b>boulders</b> up to 100  m from the shore, and the sizes of these <b>boulders</b> decrease with distance from the shore. Thus, <b>boulders</b> that do not conform to this trend could possibly be <b>boulders</b> transported by tsunamis. Verification of the method of transportation of <b>boulders</b> based on numerical simulations would be useful in areas where the coral reef is not developed and storm waves can reach the shore.|$|R

The ten ton Wallula Stone was discovered in the Columbia River Gorge, and was covered with petroglyphs. It was returned to the Umatilla tribe of Native Americans in Eastern Oregon in 1996. The old elevators inside were replaced again in 1946, and in 1948 a runaway truck destroyed part of the stone railing on the Fifth Avenue side, which was then fixed.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the <b>boulder.</b> Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E
