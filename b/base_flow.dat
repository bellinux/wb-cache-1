5|$|The {{watershed}} can {{be divided}} into two hydrologic areas with different infiltration rates. The northern area, comprising about 40percent of the watershed, consists of the Portland Terraces, and the southern consists of the Boring Hills and the Kelso Slope. Most of the rain that falls on the northern area percolates into the ground, and most of the rain that falls on the southern area runs quickly into the creek or its tributaries. Rain that falls on the north generally has a more gradual, longer-lasting effect, sustaining the <b>base</b> <b>flow</b> of the creek during dry periods.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Merced River basin is at high elevation, {{where an}} alpine climate prevails. The Sierra {{receives}} heavy snowfall in the winter, which melts {{in the spring}} and early summer causing annual flooding. By late autumn the river level has dropped considerably, and some smaller tributaries dry up altogether. Up to 85% of the flow above Happy Isles comes from melting snow. In the dry season, groundwater provides the only <b>base</b> <b>flow</b> to the river. In addition, the river is fed by dozens of high Sierra lakes, the largest of which include Merced Lake, Tenaya Lake, Ostrander Lake, the Chain Lakes, and May Lake. The foothills experience a drier Mediterranean climate, while the San Joaquin Valley floor is dry enough to be considered semi-desert.|$|E

We suggest a new approach for rate <b>based</b> <b>flow</b> control algorithms which may be considered more "optimistic" than traditional approaches. Three variations of the approach are presented and their rate of convergence to an optimal max-min fairness solution is analyzed. Finally, we suggest and analyze approximate rate <b>based</b> <b>flow</b> control algorithms. We show that under certain conditions the approximate algorithms may converge faster. However, in rare configurations we show that the resulting rates may be substantially different than the rates of the max-min vector (this difference is not necessarily bad) ...|$|R

5|$|The Trinity River is a {{predominantly}} rain-fed river, {{with the highest}} flows occurring between December and April and the lowest from August through October. The water level can rise quickly in the winter when large Pacific storms strike California's north coast. Almost no precipitation occurs in summer, when {{the primary source of}} flow is snowmelt from the higher elevations of the Klamath Mountains and groundwater <b>base</b> <b>flow.</b> In addition, diversion of water to the Central Valley has greatly reduced the total flow of the river since the 1960s, though conversely, a required minimum dam release for protection of migrating salmon results in a flow rate during the dry season that is higher than it naturally would be.|$|E
5|$|Spring Brook {{experiences}} noticeable flow loss. As of 2009, it {{has high}} levels of sodium and alkalinity. Pittson Township and the borough of Moosic have permits to discharge stormwater into it. However, the water quality and habitat quality of the stream are relatively unimpacted. The stream has relatively high water quality even where it flows through a concrete channel. In {{a study by the}} Susquehanna River Basin Commission, it was found not to fail any water quality standards either during <b>base</b> <b>flow</b> or storm flow conditions. However, a study from the previous year found concentrations of sodium and alkalinity exceeding the threshold for concern. In the early 1900s, Spring Brook was a clear stream in its upper reaches. However, by the time it reached the property of the Du Pont Powder Company, it was affected by slush pumped into it by the Pennsylvania Coal Company.|$|E
5|$|The river {{flows through}} the South Downs, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and since 2011, a {{designated}} national park. There are two large aquifers in the area, one consisting of chalk, {{to the south of}} the river valley, and the other the Lower Greensand Group, underlying the whole of the river. The aquifers are separated by a Gault Formation, which consists of clay. At {{the western edge of the}} region, both the chalk and the gault turn to the north, creating a scarp slope. The <b>base</b> <b>flow</b> of the river consists of water from the Lower Greensand aquifer, and from springs along the bottom of the chalk scarp slope. These help to maintain the flows in the river during the summer months, although there have been significant periods where flows have been low, notably in the drought of the early 1990s, and again in 1995/96. These led to declines in the populations of the macro-invertebrates which are used to measure the health of a river, but these have subsequently recovered. In order to monitor the hydrology, the Environment Agency has a series of observation boreholes along the valley, and maintains gauging stations at Princes Marsh, close to the source, at Iping Mill, at Halfway Bridge on the River Lod just above its junction with the Rother, and at Hardham, just before the river joins the Arun.|$|E
40|$|The {{migration}} and segregation {{of a minor}} silicone containing additive in a multilayer, organic coating system has been investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The silicone containing additive employed was the most compatible thermally stable, polyester modified poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) flow agent. A polyester/polyurethane (PU) based primer and a poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVdF) based topcoat on an aluminium substrate were used as a model, multilayer, organic coating system. XPS and SIMS characterisation of the PU primer formulation (with and without addition of the PDMS <b>based</b> <b>flow</b> agent), confirmed that the PDMS <b>based</b> <b>flow</b> agent segregated to the PU primers air/coating surface. Characterisation of the PVdF topcoats air/coating surface, after application and curing over the PU primers, revealed {{the presence of the}} PDMS <b>based</b> <b>flow</b> agent at the PVdF air/coating surface when the topcoat was applied to the PU primer containing the PDMS <b>based</b> <b>flow</b> agent. Ultra-low-angle microtomy (ULAM) was employed to produce an ultra-low-angle taper that passes through the entire thickness of the PVdF topcoat (~ 20 µm). XPS linescan analysis along the ULAM taper indicated that the PDMS <b>based</b> <b>flow</b> agent had migrated from the PU primer surface into the bulk of the PVdF topcoat. Analysis of the shape of the silicon concentration profile revealed the existence of a silicon concentration gradient and indicated that the PDMS <b>based</b> <b>flow</b> agent was segregating towards the PVdF topcoats air/coating surface. Such {{migration and}} segregation phenomena have major implications for formulators in the coatings/paint industries...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a number}} of issues and possibilities for more effective ABR (Available Bit Rate) traffic management which arise from a careful consideration of various time scales present in an ATM networking environment. Since the ABR applications use the remaining resources after CBR (Constant Bit Rate) and VBR (Variable Bit Rate) applications have been accommodated, the ABR rate should be controlled through a feedback <b>based</b> <b>flow</b> control scheme to avoid excessive losses. It is well known that the increased propagation delay increases the amount of bandwidth mismatch which may induce cell losses. For this reason, the effectiveness of feedback <b>based</b> <b>flow</b> control schemes reduce with increased propagation delay. But, besides the propagation delay, some other system parameters (network, ABR and VBR time scales) may also have considerable effects on the feedback <b>based</b> <b>flow</b> control schemes. In this paper by considering a tractable analytical model, the impact of these time scales is considered. Also, a proactive feedback <b>based</b> <b>flow</b> control scheme which aims {{to reduce the amount of}} bandwidth mismatch by generating early feedbacks is introduced...|$|R

25|$|The {{remaining}} winter {{flow of the}} Barada {{river is}} not used for drinking water supply in Damascus. However, it plays an important recreational role for the numerous restaurants along its upper course. It also aliments the Ghouta oasis. When it leaves the Barada gorge and enters the plain of Damascus the Barada river splits into five branches. The two Northern branches flow along {{the foot of the}} Qasium mountain towards the East. The central branches, including the Barada proper, flow through the city center alongside the old city {{into the heart of the}} Ghouta. The southernmost branch takes a turn to the West before entering the city, and flows into what is called the Western Ghouta. Historically, much of the summer <b>base</b> <b>flow</b> of these rivers derived from the Fijeh and Barada springs. However, since the springs have been captured the river carries fresh water only during the winter and spring. Downstream of Damascus, it also carries more or less diluted wastewater that is being indirectly reused for irrigation in the Ghouta. Some winter flows also end up in the intermittent Lake Al-Utaybah, the lowest point of the closed Barada basin where the water infiltrates or evaporates.|$|E
