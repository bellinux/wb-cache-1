5|$|On 21 May 1976 several Tamil {{politicians}} (A. Amirthalingam, V. N. Navaratnam, K. P. Ratnam, M. Sivasithamparam and K. Thurairatnam) were delivering leaflets {{when they}} were all arrested on government orders. Sivasithamparam was released <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> were taken to Colombo and tried for sedition. All the defendants were acquitted on 10 February 1977 after a high-profile trial-at-bar case in which around 70 prominent Tamil lawyers, including Chelvanayakam and G. G. Ponnambalam, acted for the defence.|$|E
5|$|On 5 March Major General James Cassels {{took over}} {{command of the}} division. The next action {{involving}} the division was over the night of 2/3April, when units of the Irgun attacked railway installations in the divisional area. While one attack on the Yibna railway station and police post was in progress, a mobile patrol from the 9th Parachute Battalion arrived, detonating a mine while crossing a bridge. Three of the patrol were wounded, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> took off after the saboteurs. Reinforcements arrived from the 5th and 6th Parachute Battalions. In the morning, tracks of around thirty men were discovered leading away from the area. A spotter plane later located the men and directed {{a section of the}} 8th Parachute Battalion to intercept them. After a small battle, fourteen of the saboteurs were wounded and twenty-six prisoners taken.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{tensions}} between Osden and the rest, he is sent alone to do a species survey in the forest. While he is still out alone, Porlock, one of the scientists on the team, is scared by what he believes {{to be a large}} ape in the forest. The other team members investigate for a couple of days, without finding anything, before Osden fails to contact them at a pre-assigned time. Tomiko leads three others to his camp in the forest, where they find him knocked out, apparently by an unknown assailant. They bring him back to camp, where he gradually recovers, and tells the group that he had felt a strong fear response from the forest itself. Tomiko realizes that the assailant must {{have been one of the}} other team members. While Osden is asleep, the fear emanations from the forest drive Porlock to verbally lash out at Osden, and admit to trying to kill him in the forest. Porlock attempts to assault Osden again, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> restrain him and place him under a sedative.|$|E

5|$|In August 1934, the Bassendean Road Board {{applied to}} the Lands Department to change {{the portion of the}} Perth–Guildford road within its {{district}} to Great Eastern Highway. The department refused the request, reasoning that most traffic bound for Midland used The Causeway and travelled {{on the south side of}} the Swan River, and that therefore the Perth–Guildford road should not be part of the main highway. Despite this setback, the Perth Road Board organised a local government conference to consider renaming the road from Perth to Guildford. The issue was considered important, as losing the name to the south side of the river would divert traffic away from the old established centres to the north. The straightening of dangerous bends and the replacement of an old bridge between Bassendean and Guildford were also to be considered. The conference, held on 7 September 1934, was attended by representatives of the Perth, Bayswater, Bassendean, and Guildford road boards, and the Midland Junction Council. Guildford and Midland Junction were still opposed to the renaming, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> were supportive. Motions that passed included submitting a rename proposal to the state government, urging the government to construct a new bridge at Bassendean, and approaching the government to have the road declared a main road.|$|E

25|$|In {{a review}} and {{synthesis}} of experimental evidence regarding interspecific competition, Schoener described six {{specific types of}} mechanisms by which competition occurs, including consumptive, preemptive, overgrowth, chemical, territorial, and encounter.

25|$|Six Aboriginal {{prisoners were}} sent to Rottnest Island in August 1838 under the superintendence of Mr. Welch and a small {{military}} force: Helia, for murder; Buoyeen, for assault; Mollydobbin, Tyoocan, Goordap, and Cogat, for theft. All six escaped shortly after their arrival by stealing Thomson's boat. Helia drowned during the crossing, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> apparently survived.|$|E

25|$|Anthony {{and nearly}} fifty {{other women in}} Rochester {{attempted}} {{to vote in the}} presidential election of 1872. Fifteen of them convinced the election inspectors to allow them to cast ballots, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> were turned back. There had been earlier cases of women attempting to vote, and even some cases of success, but the reaction of the authorities had been muted. When Anthony voted, however, the reaction was different, and her case became a national controversy.|$|E
25|$|The House of Glücksburg {{also held}} a {{significant}} {{interest in the}} succession to the throne. A more junior branch of the royal clan, they were also descendants of Frederick III through the daughter of King Frederick V of Denmark. Lastly, there was yet a more junior agnatic branch that was eligible to succeed in Schleswig-Holstein. There was Christian himself and his three older brothers, the eldest of whom, Karl, was childless, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> had produced children, and male children at that.|$|E

(Stevo's New and Improved Vandals). Escalante has stated that the older members relinquished control of the band's name and rights to him in {{exchange}} for permission to play the show, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> deny this claim and point out that Escalante served an injunction against them during the performance preventing them from further use of the name and music.|$|E

25|$|In the West Indies {{the elected}} {{assemblies}} of Jamaica, Grenada, and Barbados formally declared their sympathies for the American cause {{and called for}} mediation, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> were quite loyal. Britain carefully avoided antagonizing the rich owners of sugar plantations (many of whom lived in London); in turn the planters' greater dependence on slavery made them {{recognize the need for}} British military protection from possible slave revolts. The possibilities for overt action were sharply limited by the overwhelming power of Royal Navy in the islands. During the war there was some opportunistic trading with American ships.|$|E
25|$|The non-separatist Puritans {{constituted}} {{a much larger}} group than the Pilgrims, and they established the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629 with 400 settlers. They sought to reform the Church of England by creating a new, pure church in the New World. By 1640, 20,000 had arrived; many died soon after arrival, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> found a healthy climate and an ample food supply. The Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies together spawned other Puritan colonies in New England, including the New Haven, Saybrook, and Connecticut colonies. During the 17th century, the New Haven and Saybrook colonies were absorbed by Connecticut.|$|E
25|$|In the Fundamento, Zamenhof {{illustrated}} word formation by deriving the equivalents of recuperate, disease, hospital, germ, patient, doctor, medicine, pharmacy, etc. from sana (healthy). Not all of {{the resulting}} words translate well into English, in many cases because they distinguish fine shades of meaning that English lacks: Sano, sana, sane, sani, sanu, saniga, saneco, sanilo, sanigi, saniĝi, sanejo, sanisto, sanulo, malsano, malsana, malsane, malsani, malsanulo, malsaniga, malsaniĝi, malsaneta, malsanema, malsanulejo, malsanulisto, malsanero, malsaneraro, sanigebla, sanigisto, sanigilo, resanigi, resaniĝanto, sanigilejo, sanigejo, malsanemulo, sanilaro, malsanaro, malsanulido, nesana, malsanado, sanulaĵo, malsaneco, malsanemeco, saniginda, sanilujo, sanigilujo, remalsano, remalsaniĝo, malsanulino, sanigista, sanigilista, sanilista, malsanulista.

25|$|In October 1996, two {{developments}} {{occurred that}} affected the Four Horsemen when Jeff Jarrett {{came over to}} WCW from the WWF, and expressed his desire to join the Horsemen as he immediately gained a fan in Ric Flair, much {{to the chagrin of}} the other Horsemen. Flair finally let Jarrett join the group in February 1997, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> did not want him, and in July 1997 was ultimately kicked out of the group by Flair himself, who had enough of the instability Jarrett's presence caused the Horsemen. Flair also feuded with Roddy Piper, Syxx, and his old nemesis Curt Hennig in 1997, after Hennig was offered a spot in The Four Horsemen only to turn on Flair and The Four Horsemen at Fall Brawl in September 1997, in which Hennig punctuated the act by slamming the cage door onto Flair's head.|$|E
25|$|On 17 January {{the crew}} sighted the {{lighthouse}} on Partridge Island {{at the mouth}} of Saint John harbour. However the ship was driven back down the Bay of Fundy by a violent nor'easter and in the early morning of 19 January she struck a rocky headland {{at the north end of}} Grand Manan Island. All three masts were carried away and the Lord Ashburton broke up on the rocks. The captain and most of the crew were drowned but ten men reached the shore alive. Two of them froze to death on the beach, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> survived and were rescued by villagers the following day. Five of the sailors had huddled together on a ledge part way up the cliff, while the remaining three managed to reach the top of the cliff, where they took refuge in an old barn.|$|E
25|$|In some villages under Albanian {{control in}} 1998, militants drove ethnic-Serbs from their homes. Some {{of those who}} {{remained}} are unaccounted for and are presumed to have been abducted by the KLA and killed. The KLA detained an estimated 85 Serbs during its 19 July 1998 attack on Orahovac. 35 of these were subsequently released <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> remained. On 22 July 1998, the KLA briefly {{took control of the}} Belaćevac mine near the town of Obilić. Nine Serb mineworkers were captured that day and they remain on the International Committee of the Red Cross's list of the missing and are presumed to have been killed. In August 1998, 22 Serbian civilians were reportedly killed in the village of Klečka, where the police claimed to have discovered human remains and a kiln used to cremate the bodies. In September 1998, Serbian police collected 34 bodies of people believed to have been seized and murdered by the KLA, among them some ethnic Albanians, at Lake Radonjić near Glođane (Gllogjan) in {{what became known as the}} Lake Radonjić massacre.|$|E
