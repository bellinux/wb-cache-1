5|$|By 1990, 52,000 <b>black</b> <b>families</b> {{had been}} settled on 6.5 million acres. This was {{insufficient}} {{to deal with}} the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts. The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 <b>black</b> <b>families</b> on 13 million acres, which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the lower Hill District, an area {{inhabited}} predominantly {{by people of}} African descent, was completely destroyed. Ninety-five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using eminent domain, forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people (1,239 <b>black</b> <b>families,</b> 312 white), {{to make room for}} a cultural center that included the Civic Arena, which opened in 1961. Other than one apartment building, none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built.|$|E
5|$|Mississippi was {{the poorest}} {{state in the}} U.S. in the 1950s, and the Delta {{counties}} {{were some of the}} poorest in Mississippi. Mamie Carthan was born in Tallahatchie County, where the average income per white household in 1949 was $690 ($ in 2013 dollars). For <b>black</b> <b>families,</b> the figure was $462 ($ in 2013 dollars). In the rural areas, economic opportunities for blacks were almost nonexistent. They were mostly sharecroppers who lived on land owned by whites. Blacks had essentially been disenfranchised and excluded from voting and the political system since 1890, when the white-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that raised barriers to voter registration. Whites had also passed ordinances establishing racial segregation and Jim Crow laws.|$|E

5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some <b>black</b> <b>families</b> in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{researchers}} {{have studied the}} <b>black</b> <b>family</b> in American society. Unfortunately, too few {{have focused on the}} role of the family in the life of the elderly. In this paper it is my intention to focus on the strengths and weaknesses of the <b>black</b> <b>family</b> and, in particular, on the <b>black</b> <b>family</b> member as confidant. Frazier, in a book, The <b>Black</b> <b>Family,</b> edited by Robert Staples, discusses the character of the <b>black</b> <b>family</b> during the various stages of its development. He purports that the <b>black</b> <b>family</b> has been affected by the social isolation of blacks in American society. Frazier believes that it has been the family that has aided the black individual 2 ̆ 7 s survival in the face of this isolation. The family as the focus of survival is an interesting concept when considering the status of the elderly in America. Segregated groups and existing institutions have hardly provided refuge for the white elderly let alone for the black elderly. It is conceivable that the family plays an important role in the lives of the black elderly as they confront the changes and crises of growing old in America...|$|R

When Charly Manson returned to action he sided with Los Vipers instead of the <b>Black</b> <b>Family</b> leading to a match at Guerra de Titanes 2002 where the <b>Black</b> <b>Family</b> defeated Manson, Histeria, Mosco de la Merced, and Psicosis II.

The FBI brought them guard dogs and the police department had to station guards at their home. White politicians, Donald M. Fraser, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale sometimes accompanied Davis. As expected, Stenvig won reelection. Davis won the admiration of many.|$|E
25|$|The ample {{residential}} lots of Richland Farms gave residents {{enough space}} {{to raise a}} family, and food to feed them, along with building a barn, and caring for livestock. The farms attracted the <b>black</b> <b>families</b> who had begun migrating from the rural South in the 1950s, and there they found their 'home away from home' in this small community.

When she finally found a house, the neighbors were not happy. Shots were fired at her windows and she had to contact the police for protection. White families started moving out and <b>black</b> <b>families</b> started moving in. Everything remained the same in her neighborhood except for the skin color of the residents.|$|E

Prospect Township was a common destination for <b>Black</b> <b>families</b> who had been evicted from their residence in White areas. In 1936, this neighbourhood too was aggressively gentrified, razed under the Johannesburg Slums Act of 1934. Most {{of the people in}} Prospect Township were relocated to Orlando, Soweto, but Mashinini's family was able to resettle in Sophiatown.

25|$|Two of {{the most}} violent episodes {{occurred}} in Washington, D.C. and Chicago. In Washington, D.C., white men, many in military uniforms, responded to the rumored arrest of a black man for rape with four days of mob violence, rioting and beatings of random black people on the street. When police refused to intervene, the black population fought back. When the violence ended, ten whites were dead, including two police officers, and 5 blacks. Some 150 people had been the victims of attacks. The rioting in Chicago started on July 27. Chicago's beaches along Lake Michigan were segregated in practice, if not by law. A black youth who drifted into the area customarily reserved for whites was stoned and drowned. Blacks responded violently when the police refused to take action. Violence between mobs and gangs lasted 13 days. The resulting 38 fatalities included 23 blacks and 15 whites. Injuries numbered 537 injured, and 1,000 <b>black</b> <b>families</b> were left homeless. Some 50 people were reported dead. Unofficial numbers were much higher. Hundreds of mostly black homes and businesses on the South Side were destroyed by mobs, and a militia force of several thousand was called in to restore order.|$|E
25|$|Fisher was {{considered}} {{by those who}} met {{her to be a}} strong, witty businesswoman who was not afraid to speak her mind. In 1919, Fisher gave a speech {{at a meeting of the}} National Negro Business League. In her speech, Fisher told those assembled how to make a profit from catering and about her life growing up. She said she was a 57 year old woman who was not afraid to tell her age. In 1907, Fisher divorced her husband William and offered him a little over 100 dollars to not contest the divorce in court. William refused and was awarded nothing by the court system. Fisher said that her marriage wasn't a success and that for her to be successful she had to believe in herself and no one else. Fisher put her daughter Lucille through college and a music conservatory with the profits from her catering business. Fisher's first home was a 16 room house on Park Avenue which stood until 1960. In the 1920s she had a house built along Old Highway 63. During construction, she bought the materials, hired her own workers, and stayed on the property in a tent to oversee construction. Fisher was a celebrated personality in Columbia, with multiple articles written about her in the University Missourian. One particularly interesting article was her suggestions for Thanksgiving dinner. Fisher rented her properties out to <b>black</b> <b>families</b> who couldn't find housing easily in 1913. Annie gave out her recipes freely, but noted that she couldn't teach the common sense needed to cook her food. In a 1927 article in the Springfield Leader, Fisher's estimated net worth was approximately 100,000 dollars. Fisher was buried in a modest grave in 1938 at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Columbia.|$|E
