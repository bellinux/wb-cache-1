25|$|Motivation for the United States {{to engage}} the Soviet Union in a Space Race {{can be traced to}} the then {{on-going}} Cold War. Landing on the Moon was viewed as a national and technological accomplishment that would generate world-wide acclaim. <b>But</b> <b>going</b> to the Moon would be risky and expensive, as exemplified by President John F. Kennedy famously stating in a 1962 speech that the United States chose to go because it was hard.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Gorbachev {{was losing}} further ground to nationalists. October 1990 saw the {{founding}} of DemRossiya, the Russian pro-reform coalition; a few days later, both Ukraine and Russia declared their laws completely sovereign over Soviet laws. The 'war of laws' had become an open battle, with the Supreme Soviet refusing to recognise {{the actions of the}} two republics. Gorbachev would publish the draft of a new union treaty in November, which envisioned a continued union called the Union of Sovereign Soviet Republics, <b>but,</b> <b>going</b> into 1991, Gorbachev's actions were steadily overpowered by secessionism.|$|E

25|$|He was {{regarded}} as flip-flopping between conservative and reformist camps since the election of Mohammad Khatami, supporting reformers in that election, <b>but</b> <b>going</b> back to the conservative camp in the 2000 parliamentary elections {{as a result of}} the reformist party severely criticizing and refusing to accept him as their candidate. Reformists, including Akbar Ganji, accused him of involvement in murdering dissidents and writers during his presidency. In the end, the major differences between the Kargozaran and the reformists party weakened both and eventually resulted in their loss at the presidential elections in 2005. However, Rafsanjani regained close ties with the reformers since he lost the 2005 presidential elections to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.|$|E

Later in the year, he was selected in the Kenyan squad for the 2015 World Twenty20 Qualifier, the final qualification tournament for the 2016 World Twenty20.

25|$|Despite {{their lack}} of graphics, text adventures include a {{physical}} dimension where players move between rooms. Many text adventure games boasted their total number of rooms to indicate how much gameplay they offered. These games are unique in that they may create an illogical space, where going north from area A takes you to area B, <b>but</b> <b>going</b> south from area B did not {{take you back to}} area A. This can create mazes that do not behave as players expect, and thus players must maintain their own map. These illogical spaces are much more rare in today's era of 3D gaming, and the Interactive Fiction community in general decries the use of mazes entirely, claiming that mazes have become arbitrary 'puzzles for the sake of puzzles' and that they can, in the hands of inexperienced designers, become immensely frustrating for players to navigate.|$|E
25|$|At the Madrid Open she was {{defeated}} {{in the first round}} by eventual champion Aravane Rezaï 4–6, 7–5, 6–0. As a result of this loss, Henin dropped out of the top 20 to No. 23. Henin then participated at the French Open, seeded 22nd, the second grand slam of the year where she had won four previous titles. In the 1st round, she defeated Tsvetana Pironkova in 89minutes, 6–4, 6–3. In the second round, Henin faced Klára Zakopalová and defeated her 6–3, 6–3. In the third round, facing former world No. 1 Maria Sharapova, Henin ended her streak of consecutive sets at 40, losing the 2nd set to Sharapova <b>but</b> <b>going</b> on to win 6–2, 3–6, 6–3. She had then tied the number of consecutive sets won at the French Open with Helen Wills Moody. She lost to world No. 7 Samantha Stosur 6–2, 1–6, 4–6 in the fourth round, her first defeat at Roland Garros since 2004.|$|E
25|$|In {{that stage}} thirteen, the {{temperature}} was extremely high. Two riders from the North African team, Marcel Molinès and Abdel-Kader Zaaf, broke away after 15 kilometers, and created a large gap, also because the other cyclists were more occupied with getting drinks. Some 20 kilometers from the finish, Zaaf started to zigzag across the road. A safety official pulled him from the race, afraid for his safety, and Molinès rode through alone. Zaaf {{did not agree with}} the safety official, and mounted his bicycle again. He quickly fell off his bicycle and fell asleep, and spectators moved him into the shade of a tree. When he woke up, he realized that he was in a race, got on his bicycle again and rode away, <b>but</b> <b>going</b> into the wrong direction. An ambulance was called, and Zaaf was taken away. Zaaf claimed that he had received wine from a spectator, and as a Muslim he was not used to the alcohol. Behind the two North-African cyclists, Kübler had attacked, and left his rivals Raphaël Géminiani and Louison Bobet minutes behind. Of the favourites, only Ockers managed to stay with Kübler.|$|E

25|$|In 1887, he {{published}} Omul periculos, a pamphlet attacking the regnant House of Hohenzollern, accusing {{the king of}} abusing his prerogatives and allowing his ministers to ignore the constitution while suggesting he abdicate. Sued for lèse-majesté, {{he was sentenced to}} two years' imprisonment and a fine of 5000 lei. After writing an article to explain he was not fleeing <b>but</b> <b>going</b> into exile, he left for Vienna in May and was returned in absentia to the Assembly the following January, as an opposition member. In February, he was arrested but soon released, having gained parliamentary immunity. A government crisis was going on at the same time, and Panu, both in parliament and in Lupta, bitterly attacked the new government of Theodor Rosetti and the continued influence of Junimea. Later that year, he put forth a program for his party, which touched on subjects such as the peasantry, industrial development, relations between owners and workers, social insurance and universal suffrage. He shared these objectives with the socialists, along with an anti-dynastic outlook and calls for an eight-hour workday and Sundays off. However, his Radicals began to diverge from the socialists during the 1888 crisis: while the former took an active role both in parliament and in the streets, the latter kept its distance in the belief that the situation did not concern them.|$|E
500|$|Director of {{photography}} Ben Davis used Arri Alexa XT cameras for the film, saying, [...] "I’m traditionally a photochemical fan, <b>but</b> <b>going</b> with the digital format {{was the right}} way for this movie... the Alexa [...] the right look for this particular film." [...] During the opening scenes in the 1980s, Davis chose JDC Cooke Xtal (Crystal) Express anamorphic prime lenses because they [...] "had more anamorphic artifacts and aberrations, which [...] felt added something." [...] Davis used spherical Panavision Primos {{for the rest of}} the film. Additionally, Davis worked closely with production designer Charles Wood in order to achieve the correct lighting looks for each scene. Dealing with two fully CGI characters forced Davis to shoot scenes multiple times, usually once with the references for the characters and once without them in the shot.|$|E

500|$|Browne had {{his first}} success at a major {{competition}} {{when he won the}} 10mile at his first Australian Championships in 1953.

Marchant had risen to prominence by winning the 500m time trial at the 1955 Australian Championships for juniors, prompting Browne to select him as his partner based on his raw speed.

[...] Similar to Batman Forever, this primarily included {{the decision to}} add nipples and enlarged codpieces to Batman and Robin suits. Schumacher stated, [...] "I {{had no idea that}} putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines. The bodies of the suits come from ancient Greek statues, which display perfect bodies. They are anatomically correct." [...] Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, felt [...] "it wasn't so much the nipples that bothered me. It was the codpiece.
