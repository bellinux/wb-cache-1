The main parameters of the band spectrum (the band filling with electrons degree and the total effective band width) have been determined. The dependencies of these from contents of substituting elements are discussed. Analyzing the results obtained simultaneously with the tendencies in oxygen content and critical temperature change we have confirmed the conclusion that the oxygen sublattice disordering has a determinant effect on band structure parameters and superconductive properties of YBa 2 Cu 3 O(y).
