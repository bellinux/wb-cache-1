50|$|Sometime after nylon-backed {{neoprene}} appeared, {{the blind}} stitch method was developed. A <b>blindstitch</b> sewing machine uses a curved needle, {{which does not}} {{go all the way}} through the neoprene but just shallowly dips in behind the fabric backing, crosses the glue line, and emerges from the surface on the same side of the neoprene. This is similar to the overlock stitching used for teeshirts and other garments made from knitted fabrics.|$|E
50|$|The curved needle {{allows the}} fabric backing to be sewn {{together}} without punching a hole completely through the neoprene, and thereby eliminating the water-leakage holes along the seam. <b>Blindstitch</b> seams also lay flat, butting up {{the edge of}} one sheet against another, allowing the material to lay flatter {{and closer to the}} skin. For these reasons blindstitching rapidly became the primary method of sewing wetsuits together, with other methods now used mainly for decorative or stylistic purposes.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{the basic}} motion of needles, loopers and bobbins, the {{material}} being sewn must move {{so that each}} cycle of needle motion involves {{a different part of}} the material. This motion is known as feed, and sewing machines have almost as many ways of feeding material as they do of forming stitches. For general categories, there are: drop feed, needle feed, walking foot, puller, and manual. Often, multiple types of feed are used on the same machine. Besides these general categories, there are also uncommon feed mechanisms used in specific applications like edge joining fur, making seams on caps, and <b>blindstitching.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thread weight {{conversion}} tableFor example: 40 weight = 225 denier = Tex 25. A common Tex {{number for}} general sewing thread is Tex 25 or Tex 30. A slightly heavier silk buttonhole thread suitable for bartacking, small leather items, and decorative seams might be Tex 40. A strong, durable upholstery thread, Tex 75. A heavy duty topstitching thread for coats, bags, and shoes, Tex 100. A very strong topstitching thread suitable for luggage and tarpaulins, Tex 265-Tex 290. But a fine serging thread, only Tex 13. For <b>blindstitching</b> and felling machines, an even finer Tex 8.|$|R
5000|$|Hugh Bradner, a University of California, Berkeley {{physicist}} {{invented the}} modern wetsuit in 1952. Wetsuits became {{available in the}} mid-1950s and evolved as the relatively fragile foamed neoprene was first backed, and later sandwiched, with thin sheets of tougher material such as nylon or later Lycra/Spandex. Improvements in the way joints in the wetsuit were made by gluing, taping and <b>blindstitching,</b> helped the suit to remain waterproof and reduce flushing, the replacement of water trapped between suit and body by cold water from the outside. Further improvements in the seals at the neck, wrists, ankles and zippers produced a suit known as a [...] "semi-dry".|$|R
5000|$|As wetsuits {{continued}} to evolve, their use was explored {{in other sports}} such as open-water swimming and triathlons. Although double-backed neoprene is strong, the cloth backing is rough and creates {{a large amount of}} drag in the water, slowing down the swimmer. A single-backed suit meanwhile has a very smooth, slick exterior permitting water to slide easily over the bare neoprene. With the advances of elastic Lycra backings and <b>blindstitching,</b> single-backed neoprene suits could now be made that outperformed the early cousins from the 1970s.Other developments in single-backed wetsuits include the suits designed for free-diving and spearfishing. Single lined neoprene is more flexible than double lined. To achieve flexibility and low bulk for a given warmth of suit, they are unlined inside, and the smooth surface of the neoprene is removed mechanically to reveal a rougher [...] "open cell" [...] surface which adheres closely to the skin and reduces flushing of the suit. The lined outer surface may be printed with camouflage patterns for spearfishing.|$|R
