In 1937, the municipal architect, Rodolfo Martinez, renovated the building, with particular emphasis on stylistic uniformity, expanding its towers and changing its decorative elements. It features a balustrade, a central <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> columns.|$|E

The abbot of the monastery resides in a house located near the gate at the southeastern corner of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|Martin Nyrop {{was one of}} {{the main}} proponents of the National Romantic style. The main aim was to use {{distinctive}} Nordic motifs from the distant past, as is clearly demonstrated in Copenhagen City Hall which was completed in 1905. The City Hall is certainly Copenhagen's most monumental and most original building from the last quarter of the 19th century with its impressive facade, the golden statue of Absalon just above the <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> its tall, slim clock tower. It was inspired by the Siena City Hall.|$|E

Recovering, Michael recaptures Laurie before she can leave and heads back to the house. Loomis again intervenes, but Michael subdues him. Laurie takes Loomis' gun and runs upstairs, but Michael corners her on a <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> charges her head-on, knocking both of them over the railing. Laurie finds herself {{on top of an}} unconscious Michael. Aiming Loomis' gun at his face, she fires just as Michael awakens.|$|E
50|$|Brand {{took the}} basic {{form of a}} Federal-style house and added several cabinets, <b>balconies,</b> <b>and</b> {{galleries}}. The <b>balconies</b> <b>and</b> galleries are more typical of French Louisiana style architecture and were an adaptation necessary because of the warm climate.

The building also houses the magistrates courts and other offices. The Assize court last sat here in October 1970.|$|E

5|$|Built in 1483, it has {{a square}} base, a {{transitional}} segment leading into an octagonal shaft, then a 10 - sided polygon shaft, followed by a cylindrical shaft that consists of 8 brick pillars, each two adjoined by bricks in between. The Minaret of Qaytbay also has three balconies, supported by muqarnas, a form of stalactite vaulting which provide a smooth transition from a flat surface to a curved one (first recorded to {{have been used in}} Egypt in 1085), that adorn the minaret. The first shaft is octagonal is decorated with keel-arched panels on each side, with a cluster of three columns separating each panel. Above this shaft is the second octagonal shaft which is separated from the first by a <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> decorated with plaiting. A second balcony separates this shaft with the final cylindrical shaft, decorated with four arches. Above this is the third balcony, crowned by the finial top of the minaret.|$|E
5|$|Further {{depictions of}} Mary {{are found in}} the church background. They include a statue of the Virgin and Child {{positioned}} between two lit candles in the choir screen behind the main figures, and to the right two angels stand in the choir singing her praises (perhaps singing the hymn inscribed on the frame). Above her is an annunciation relief, and in the recessed bay a relief depicting her coronation; the crucifixion is shown on the rood. Thus, the stages of Mary's life as mother of Jesus are depicted in the painting. A two-column prayer tablet – similar to the one depicted in Rogier van der Weyden's large Seven Sacraments Altarpiece (1445–50) – hangs on a pier to the left. It contains words alluding to and echoing the lines on the original frame. The windows of the clerestory overlook flying buttresses, and cobwebs are visible between the arches of the vault. Several different building phases {{can be seen in the}} arched gallery, while the choral <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> transept are depicted in a more contemporary style than the nave.|$|E

5|$|The Cathedral of San Giovanni Battista in Ragusa Superiore {{was built}} between 1718 and 1778. Its {{principal}} façade is pure Baroque, containing fine carvings and sculptures. The cathedral {{has a high}} Sicilian belfry in the same style. The ornate Baroque interior is separated into three colonnaded aisles (Illustration 3). Ragusa Superiore, the most badly damaged part of the town, was replanned following 1693 around the cathedral and displays an unusual phenomenon of Sicilian Baroque: the palazzi here are peculiar to this town, of only two storeys and long, with the central bay only emphasised by a <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> an arch to the inner garden. This very Portuguese style, probably designed to minimise damage in future earthquakes, {{is very different from}} the palazzi in Ragusa Ibla, which are in true Sicilian style. Unusually, Baroque lingered on here until the early 19th century. The last palazzo built here was in the Baroque form but with columns of Roman Doric and neoclassical balconies.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} is eight minutes long. Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård plays Gaga's boyfriend. The video {{features}} a murderous plot line involving a doomed starlet who is constantly followed by photographers. The video {{opens with a}} shot of a seaside mansion, where Gaga and her boyfriend are shown lying on a bed talking in Swedish. They move to the <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> start making out; however, when hidden photographers start taking pictures of them, Gaga realizes that her boyfriend has set the paparazzi to photograph her and tries to stop him. Her struggles nevertheless remain futile even when she punches him, and in a final frantic attempt at defense, she smashes a nearby bottle of liquor into his face. The enraged boyfriend throws her over the balcony. Gaga lies {{on the ground in}} her own blood as the photographers continue take pictures of her bloody body and tabloid headlines proclaim that her career is over. According to Rolling Stone this scene pays homage to Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a scene of the ocean at night. It then shows a mansion by the water, in which Buena is seen {{standing}} by a balcony. The following scene shows Range entering the mansion as two men open the doors for her. Buena is shown walking {{in the middle of}} a masquerade ball, in which she captures the attention of a man. The Sugababes are shown on a couch, where Buchanan holds a man's hand; they all then walk down the mansion's staircase. Each group member begins to dance with a man at the ball. Buena walks towards a mirror which depicts a reflection of the Sugababes, while Buchanan drops her white mask which subsequently shatters. Towards the end of the video, they are shown leaving the ball before Buchanan jumps off the <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> into the water. All three members are shown collectively in the water, which begins to fade out into the sky. The last scene shows the men that were in the mansion walking away.|$|E

The player character eventually learns that a series of illegal experiments was being undertaken by a clandestine research team under the authority and supervision of biomedical company Umbrella Corporation. The creatures roaming the mansion and its surrounding areas are the results of these experiments, which have exposed the mansion's personnel and various animals and insects to a highly contagious and mutagenic biological agent known as the T-virus.|$|E
5|$|Sue Ellen {{has become}} a {{powerful}} woman in Dallas, leading successful fundraising campaigns and making connections with influential Texans. Her success has led her to run for Governor of Texas, with campaign backers already lining up to support her.

5|$|The {{first floor}} of the {{building}} was built as a grand 1,200-seat auditorium with a proscenium stage, and meeting rooms dedicated to student organizations. The second floor consisted of a U-shaped <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> the Old Council Room, a gathering space for smaller organizations. The Old Council Room was repainted in 1945 as part of a minor renovation of the building that also included the opening of a student eatery called The Hoot on the west side. The ceiling was made from decorated plaster and dentils evoked the exterior neoclassical architectural style. The basement housed several offices and later a bicycle exchange, used bookshop, and student storage space. After the 1973 renovation, dishwashing equipment for the ACDC was housed upstairs, along with staff offices. The 2003 renovation saw the removal of this dishwashing equipment; instead, the second upstairs was repurposed as a multifunctional student space, in line with the original intentions for the building. The second story—called UpC—is now an open space capable of seating 600 people when chairs are added; it also features multimedia equipment and a third-floor mezzanine that, until 2015, housed the UpC Cafe.|$|E
