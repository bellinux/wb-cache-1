500|$|During the trial, Lhermitte {{testified that}} {{her role as}} wife and mother was {{disrupted}} by having the middle-aged Belgian doctor, Michel Schaar, {{living in the same}} house as part of the family. According to Lhermitte, Scharr accompanied her and Moqadem on their honeymoon and stayed in their room. Lhermitte stated, [...] "We [...] had to wait until he fell asleep <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> make love. I found that weird but Bouchaib said he regarded him as his stepfather. I think the doctor loved my husband in a platonic way." ...|$|E
500|$|On a state {{television}} show, Ministry of Interior spokesman Tariq Al-Hassan said that fiftypolice officers had been injured, including two with serious sword wounds and that [...] "one protester drove over police resulting in injuries including cutting-off fingers of a policeman <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> catch him." [...] He also denied policemen prevented ambulances from reaching Pearl Roundabout or attacked any paramedics, but instead: [...] "What {{happened is that}} protesters stole an ambulance car, so we were checking on every ambulance that reaches the roundabout." [...] One doctor working at SMC's ER supported the government's account, accusing protesters of attacking the Under-Secretary-of-State for Health, taking control of all hospital entrances and stealing an ambulance.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} to New York, the New York Dolls played to capacity crowds at venues such as Max's Kansas City and the Mercer Arts Center in what Sylvain called a determined effort to [...] "fake it {{until they could}} make it": [...] "We had to make ourselves feel famous <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> actually become famous. We acted like we were already rock stars. Arthur even called his bass 'Excalibur' after King Arthur. It was crazy." [...] Their performance at the Mercer Arts Center was attended by journalist and Mercury Records publicity director Bud Scoppa, and Paul Nelson, an A executive for the label. Scoppa initially viewed them as an amusing but inferior version of the Rolling Stones: [...] "I split after the first set. Paul stuck around for the second set, though, and after show he called me and said, 'You should have stayed. I think they're really special.' Then, after that, I {{fell in love with}} them anyway." [...] In March 1973, the group signed a two-album deal with a US $25,000 advance from Mercury. According to Sylvain, some of the members' parents had to sign for them because they were not old enough to sign themselves.|$|E

500|$|The band's debut album, Take This to Your Grave, {{was issued}} by Fueled by Ramen in May 2003. Previously, {{one of the}} band's {{earliest}} recordings, Evening Out with Your Girlfriend, had not seen release until shortly before Grave in March 2003, when the band had gained considerable momentum. [...] "Our record was something being rushed out to help generate some interest, but that interest was building <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> even get the record out," [...] said Sean Muttaqi. The band actively tried to stop Uprising from releasing the recordings (as the band's relationship with Muttaqi had grown sour), as the band viewed it as a [...] "giant piece of garbage" [...] recorded before Hurley's involvement that the band members ceased to consider the debut album of the group. Gradually, the band's fanbase grew in size as the label pushed for the album's mainstream success. According to Wentz, shows began to end in a near-riot and the group were banned from several venues because the entire crowd would end up onstage. The band gained positive reviews for subsequent gigs at South by Southwest (SXSW) and various tour appearances. The band joined the Warped Tour for five dates {{in the summer of}} 2004, and on one date the band had only performed three songs when the stage collapsed due to the large crowd. The band appeared {{on the cover of the}} August 2004 edition of Alternative Press, and listening stations at Hot Topic partially helped the album move 2,000-3,000 copies per week by Christmas 2004, at which point the label considered the band [...] "tipping" [...] into mainstream success.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the other}} Beatles {{urged him to}} return, Starr rejoined the group almost two weeks later on 4 September 1968 when he participated in the filming of a promotional video for [...] "Hey Jude". George Harrison covered his drum kit in flowers to welcome him back. [...] During {{a break in the}} filming of the [...] "Hey Jude" [...] video, Marc Sinden (who appears in the film) recalls Lennon playing a song on his {{acoustic}} guitar. [...] "Everyone went 'Wow'... Filming started <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> ask what it was. When it was later released, we realised it was Back in the USSR." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1967 lecture to the Greek Astronomical Society, {{broadcast}} on Athens Radio, Santorinis first publicly revealed {{what had been}} found in his 1947 investigation. [...] "We soon established that they were not missiles. But, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do any more, the Army, after conferring with foreign officials (presumably U.S. Defense Dept.), ordered the investigation stopped. Foreign scientists [...] flew to Greece for secret talks with me". Later Santorinis told UFO researchers such as Raymond Fowler that secrecy was invoked because officials were afraid to admit of a superior technology against which we have [...] "no possibility of defense".|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, Scottish {{researcher}} James Easton {{obtained the}} original witness {{statements made by}} {{those involved in the}} first night’s sightings. One of the witnesses, Ed Cabansag, said in his statement: [...] "We figured the lights were coming from past the forest since nothing was visible when we passed through the woody forest. We would see a glowing near the beacon light, but as we got closer we found it to be a lit-up farmhouse. We got to a vantage point where we could determine that what we were chasing was only a beacon light off in the distance." [...] Another participant, John Burroughs, also stated: [...] "We could see a beacon going around so we went towards it. We followed it for about two miles [...] <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> [...] it was coming from a lighthouse." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the events}} of [...] (1985), the Bene Tleilax have been all but {{eradicated}} by the Honored Matres save for one Master, Scytale; he is a ghola of the original Scytale of Dune Messiah, somehow having ascended from Face Dancer to Master. He tells the Bene Gesserit leader Darwi Odrade that [...] "Descendants of people we sent into the Scattering returned with captive Futars. [...] A mingling of human and cat, as you doubtless know. [...] But they did not reproduce in our tanks. [...] And <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> determine why, the ones brought to us died." [...] Both Odrade and Scytale realize this was a ploy of the descendant Tleilaxu to gain {{the confidence of the}} Masters and yet not divulge their secrets. Held against his will by the Bene Gesserit, Scytale's secret bargaining tool is a hidden nullentropy capsule containing cells carefully and secretly collected by the Tleilaxu for millennia, including the cells of Tleilaxu Masters, Face Dancers, Paul Atreides, Chani, Gurney Halleck, Thufir Hawat and other legendary figures. He intends to not only grow his own life-sustaining ghola, but to resurrect the rest of his order as well. In the meantime, he has given the Bene Gesserit enough of the axlotl technology to grow their own gholas, in particular a replacement for their military genius Miles Teg.|$|E
2500|$|Although MythDevelopers {{worked to}} update The Fallen Lords and Soulblighter to newer {{operating}} systems on both Mac and PC, fix bugs, and create unofficial patches to enhance both the games {{themselves and the}} mapmaking tools, their initial focus was on the bug-ridden release versions of The Wolf Age, which had problems running on both Windows XP and OS X. Upon getting the code for The Wolf Age, they discovered they [...] "couldn't even build a usable app. We had to rewrite the Mac input routines <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> even make an app." [...] They were also given access to the source code for [...] "BurgerLib", a proprietary development library created by Bill Heineman, lead developer on the Mac version of the game. Additionally, they developed their own library, dubbed the Myth Core Library, which provided networking, input routines, and other low-level functions. This enabled MythDevelopers to avoid the necessity of licensing any external libraries, and instead allowed them to develop everything in-house. This was part of their deal with Take-Two, as they couldn't incorporate anything into the games which they {{would be unable to}} give Take-Two the rights to should the company ever ask for the source code back; all modifications remained the intellectual property of Take-Two, who were free to use them in a future commercial version of Myth, if they ever wanted to re-release an upgraded version of {{one or more of the}} games, or incorporate the modifications into the development of a new Myth game.|$|E
