40|$|A history' is an artists’ book (edition of 10) {{made from}} Corrugated card, tissue paper, newsprint, letterpress, <b>binding</b> <b>screw</b> and string. The book {{presents}} repetitions {{of the phrase}} “ 1. the factory, 2. the school, 3. the workhouse, 4. the prison” taken from a note by Humphrey Jennings in his anthology ‘Pandaemonium: The Coming of the Machine As Seen by Contemporary Observers (1660 - 1886) ’. Jennings comments on ‘The History of Derby’ (1817) in which W. Hutton recounts his experiences as a child apprentice at the Derby Silk Mill c. 1730 : “The abstract horror of the image derives {{in part from the}} unspoken acknowledgement of the truth as far as 18 th century poor were concerned: 1. the factory, 2. the school, 3. the workhouse, 4. the prison, were all the same building. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{traditional}} {{wood core}} downhill ski {{can only be}} mounted three times before the cores become compromised by holes in them. Binding plates can be used but require the user to ski high above the ski and can decrease performance by making them harder to maneuver. One way this could be solved is by a removable integrated binding plate in the ski so that it provides lateral support with {{the core of the}} ski, but doesn’t require the user to ski above the top of the ski. The basic system derives from the idea of the <b>binding</b> plate. <b>Screws</b> can be interchangeable in tapped metal but not in wood because the screw will tear the wood and deform the threads more than in metal. A traditional ski has a wood core in which the <b>binding</b> <b>screws</b> are installed with wood glue. Removal of these screws compromises the wood core and makes those holes unusable. Testing will be done spring quarter should show if the ski designed can behave like a traditional ski, hold the same pullout strength on the <b>binding</b> <b>screws,</b> yet be mounted more than three times. In this project, the ski will be totally redesigned, and will require meticulous calculations for user safety...|$|R

The spring on the left pulls on the binding clamps on the right (silver), forcing them towards {{the center of the}} binding. The <b>binding</b> plate, <b>screwed</b> {{to the bottom of the}} boot, is held in place by these clamps. A plate has been {{inserted}} in the upper binding for illustration purposes.|$|R

50|$|Snowboard boot <b>bindings</b> are {{normally}} <b>screwed</b> onto the snowboard in a permanent orientation {{which is almost}} perpendicular to the direction of travel of the snowboard. When a snowboarder reaches {{the bottom of a}} run, the rear boot is typically released from its binding to allow the snowboarder to propel himself forward across relatively flat snow. Because the front foot in the snowboard binding is at an angle to forward motion, the snowboarder experiences discomfort and tension on his leg, knee and foot joint.|$|R
50|$|Mating {{fasteners}} {{are known}} by many different names: sex bolt, <b>binding</b> posts, Chicago <b>screws,</b> interscrews, barrel bolts, barrel nut, partition screws, door closure bolts, furniture screws, panel fasteners, architectural sex bolts, arch series screws, hinge screws, display fasteners, screw nuts, connector bolts, threaded rivets, grommet nuts, post and screw sets, book screws, and stationary screws. Applications vary widely from book binding to installing bathroom partitions. This group of fasteners {{are used to}} assemble fitness apparatus, solar panels, playground equipment, railing systems, furniture, athletic helmets, knives, store fixtures, signs, panic bars, and many other products.|$|R

The general principles of good design for small feeders are enlarged upon, together with issues to look for when trouble shooting these equipment items. The system in question used a screw to dose a moist pelleted talc into a process at a nominal rate which was variable at around 1 t/h and originally suffered from poor flow in the hopper, a variable dosing rate and <b>binding</b> of the <b>screw,</b> thus needing constant attention from the operator to keep it working. Various types of mechanical flow assistance device had been tried, most of which made the problem worse. The Wolfson Centre redesigned the screw and hopper of the unit, and the performance problems were cleared. The problems with the original and intermediate designs serve to illustrate very well the points {{that need to be}} observed, in obtaining good performance from small feeders...|$|R
40|$|Timber end-beams {{represent}} portions {{with high}} risk of degradation due to biotic agents like rot fungi and insect attacks. Different repair techniques are available, with distinctive level of intrusion, but the substitution of the damaged part with a solid wood prosthesis is a methodology well accepted. The connection of the prosthesis to the original member can use <b>screws,</b> <b>binding</b> strips, stirrups and glued-in rods. Despite {{it is possible to}} find different case studies in literature, no study is known for the case of maritime pine beams and pros-thesis connected with glued-in steel rods. This works intends to fill this gap by presenting an experimental campaign aimed to evaluate a technique to repair timber end beams through the use of wood prosthesis connected to the original element by glued-in steel rods. For comparison purposes, the addition of new timber elements connected by screws is also evaluated as its represents a current practice in Portugal. The present work is part of a research project supported by program Quadro de Referência Estratégico Nacional (QREN) from the Agência de Inovação (ADI) through the project Va-le Inovação REPAR - Desenvolvimento de um sistema integrado de reforço alternativo pa-ra construções históricas...|$|R
40|$|Popularity of Cold-Formed Steel (CFS) {{structures}} {{has recently}} increased considerably {{in the last}} years as a consequence of discovered advantages such as lightness of the material, significant energy absorption capacity providing seismic performance against lateral loading, time efficiency and cost effectiveness. CFS structures are composed of shear panels which involve cold-formed steel bare frames coated with different kind of sheathings such as gypsumwallboard (GWB), oriented strand board (OSB), plywood or some infill materials which are connected to the frame. Combination of CFS bare frames and sheathing boards provides the shear panelswith lateral load resistance against seismic actions. There are several factorswhich have a direct influence on the behavior of CFS shear panels such as type of sheathing board, thickness of cold-formed steel, spacing of the <b>screws</b> <b>binding</b> the sheathing board to the bare frame and magnitude of the axial loads. On behalf of observing the impact of these outlined factors upon the behavior of CFS shear panels as well as to attain some experimental data to be utilized in the new Turkish Earthquake Code 2016, a considerable amount of laboratory tests was conducted in Structures Laboratory of Bogazici University on different configurations of CFS shear panels. Posterior to the acquisition of these experimental data, studies upon developing analytical models representing the actual experimental behavior of one of the shear panels have been conducted, thus providing possibilities for 3 -D seismic performance assessment of a representative one-story cold-formed steel structure for the final part of this paper. status: publishe...|$|R
