Ramon began the match by chokeslamming Michaels. Michaels recovered, however, and performed a neckbreaker on Ramon. Michaels then threw Ramon out to the ringside, where Michaels' bodyguard Diesel clotheslined Ramon. Referee Earl Hebner responded by ordering Diesel {{to return to the}} dressing rooms. Ramon pulled up the padding from the concrete floor, but he was later thrown onto it after Michaels reversed Ramon's attempt to perform the Razor's Edge. While Ramon was lying on the floor, Michaels brought the ladder to the ring and used it to hit Ramon in the stomach, chest and back. Michaels tried to retrieve the <b>belts,</b> but Ramon stopped him from climbing the ladder. Michaels then set the ladder up {{in the corner of the}} ring and performed a splash onto Ramon. Ramon recovered and Irish whipped Michaels into the ladder. He then hit Michaels with the ladder several times before both men tried to climb up to get the <b>belts.</b> Ramon suplexed Michaels off the ladder and tried to reach the <b>belts.</b> Michaels dropkicked the ladder, which caused Ramon to fall off.

40|$|A {{total of}} 49 dynamic sled tests were {{performed}} with the Hybrid III 10 YO to examine issues relating to child <b>belt</b> fit. The goals of these tests were to evaluate ATD response to realistic <b>belt</b> geometries and <b>belt</b> fit, develop methods for accurate, repeatable evaluation of restraint conditions for older children, identify dependent measures that differentiate between good and poor restraint performance, and relate ATD performance to static <b>belt</b> fit with children. The first series of tests {{examined the effects of}} lap <b>belt</b> tension, <b>belt</b> configuration, and seating procedure on dynamic responses of the ATD. The second series of tests examined how different designs of booster seat lap <b>belt</b> guides and shoulder <b>belt</b> guides affect performance. In addition, the ATD’s response to different shoulder <b>belt</b> and lap <b>belt</b> geometries was evaluated. With regard to test procedures, use of a lap/shoulder <b>belt</b> with a sliding latchplate produced similar results to using a lap/shoulder <b>belt</b> with fixed anchorages. Use of a production retractor reduced shoulder <b>belt</b> load, as well as head, neck, and chest measures. Reducing lap <b>belt</b> tension to a more realistic 2 lb (rather than 15 lb) did not have a pronounced effect on ATD kinematics with two different booster seats. The UMTRI seating procedure, which produces ATD postures closer to those measured in real children, also prevents the lap <b>belt</b> from being trapped in the gap between the pelvis and the thigh. Use of the UMTRI seating procedure produces more reclined initial postures and more pronounced chin-to-chest contact. A well-designed booster lap <b>belt</b> guide can maintain good <b>belt</b> position dynamically, even with poor lap <b>belt</b> geometry. Shoulder <b>belt</b> guide designs affect ATD kinematics. However, preventing the shoulder <b>belt</b> from coming out of the shoulder <b>belt</b> guide does not necessarily produce better restraint performance, because the <b>belt</b> can still come off of the ATD shoulder during the event, and stiffening booster seats does not necessarily produce better routing of the shoulder <b>belt</b> dynamically. Shoulder <b>belt</b> scores less than 70 mm produce good torso kinematics with the 10 YO ATD, but use of HIC as an injury criterion tends to discourage booster seat designs that produce good <b>belt</b> fit on the 10 YO ATD. Lap <b>belt</b> angle affects torso kinematics, with shallower lap <b>belt</b> angles leading to submarining and more vertical lap <b>belt</b> angles leading to rollout. Wider spacing of lap <b>belt</b> anchorages leads to submarining, while narrowing spacing leads to rollout. Both upper and lower <b>belt</b> anchorage locations have a strong effect on ATD kinematics. Although good booster designs can mitigate the consequences of poor vehicle lap <b>belt</b> geometry, boosters cannot always overcome poor shoulder <b>belt</b> geometry to keep the <b>belt</b> on the ATD shoulder dynamically, even when they are able to create good static <b>belt</b> fit. This finding suggests that more attention should be focused on the effects of the wide variability in vehicle upper anchorage locations on <b>belt</b> restraint performance for children. Also, because HIC scores are decreased when the torso <b>belt</b> fit is degraded, use of HIC as an injury criterion for booster testing may lead to worse rather than better booster designs...|$|R

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study was conducted}} to quantify the effects of belt-positioning boosters on lap and shoulder <b>belt</b> fit. Postures and <b>belt</b> fit were measured for forty-four boys and girls ages 5 to 12 in four highback boosters, one backless booster, and on a vehicle seat without a booster. <b>Belt</b> anchorage locations were varied over a wide range. Seat cushion angle, seat back angle, and seat cushion length were varied in the no-booster conditions. All boosters produced better mean lap <b>belt</b> fit than was observed in the no-booster condition, but the differences among boosters were relatively large. With one midrange <b>belt</b> configuration, the lap <b>belt</b> was not fully below the anterior-superior iliac spine (ASIS) landmark {{on the front of the}} pelvis for 89 % of children in one booster, and 75 % of children failed to achieve that level of <b>belt</b> fit in another. In contrast, the lap <b>belt</b> was fully below the ASIS for all but two children in the best-performing booster. Child body size had a statistically significant but relatively small effect on lap <b>belt</b> fit. The largest children sitting without a booster had approximately the same lap <b>belt</b> fit as the smallest children experienced in the worst-performing booster. Increasing lap <b>belt</b> angle relative to horizontal produced significantly better lap <b>belt</b> fit in the no-booster condition, but the boosters isolated the children from the effects of lap <b>belt</b> angles. Reducing seat cushion length in the no-booster condition improved lap <b>belt</b> fit but changing cushion angle did not. <b>Belt</b> upper anchorage (D-ring) location had a strong effect on shoulder <b>belt</b> fit in conditions without shoulder <b>belt</b> routing from the booster. Unexpectedly, the worst average shoulder <b>belt</b> fit was observed in one highback booster with a poorly positioned shoulder <b>belt</b> routing clip. The shoulder <b>belt</b> was routed more outboard, on average, with a backless booster than without a booster, but raising the child also amplified the effect of D-ring location, such that children were more likely to experience poor shoulder <b>belt</b> fit due to outboard and forward D-ring locations when sitting on the booster. Taller children experienced more-outboard shoulder <b>belt</b> fit in conditions without shoulder <b>belt</b> routing by the booster and in the one booster with poor shoulder <b>belt</b> routing. Adjustable shoulder <b>belt</b> routing on three of the highback boosters effectively eliminated stature effects, providing approximately the same shoulder <b>belt</b> fit for all children. Seat back angle did not have a significant effect on shoulder <b>belt</b> fit. The <b>belt</b> fit was measured in each test condition using the 6 YO and 10 YO Hybrid-III ATDs. ATD <b>belt</b> fit was strongly correlated with child <b>belt</b> fit across test conditions, but offsets between the ATD and child <b>belt</b> fit scores were observed due to anatomical and postural differences between the ATDs and children. The results of this study have broad applicability toward the improvement of occupant restraints for children. The data show substantial effects of booster design on <b>belt</b> fit, particularly the effects of alternative lap and torso <b>belt</b> routing approaches. Regression analyses quantify the critical importance of <b>belt</b> anchorage location for child <b>belt</b> fit, providing an important foundation for efforts to optimize <b>belt</b> geometry for children. The strong correlation between ATD and child <b>belt</b> fit scores means that ATD-based measurements can reliably be used to assess booster and vehicle designs with respect to child <b>belt</b> fit...|$|R
