25|$|The Social Suicide Bomber (Raskopoulos) is an awkward-looking {{man in a}} {{burgundy}} <b>blazer</b> <b>and</b> salmon-pink shirt who is {{summoned by}} people who are stuck in unpleasant social situations - such as an unattractive man flirting with a woman who doesn't want that kind of attention - by pressing a large red button. He drives away the unwanted person with banal comments or bizarre actions, like demonstrating his pterodactyl impersonation. Unfortunately, with that person gone, the Social Suicide Bomber then often turns his sights to the person who called him, creating a situation that was more awkward than the one to begin with.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, {{more women}} were joining the work force, so, {{by the early}} 1980s, working women were no longer {{considered}} unusual. As a way to proclaim themselves as equals in the job market, women started to dress more seriously at work. Popular clothes {{for women in the}} job market include knee-length skirts, wide-legged slacks, a matching <b>blazer,</b> <b>and</b> a blouse of a different color. Kitten-heeled shoes were often worn. Formal shoes became more comfortable during this period in time, with manufacturers adding soles that were more flexible and supportive. The shoes with moderately spiked heels and relatively pointy toes from the very late 1970s remained a fashion trend.|$|E
25|$|On 26 December 1809, <b>Blazer</b> <b>and</b> Paz {{were serving}} {{independently}} blockading the river Ems when Blazer captured an American vessel that {{was attempting to}} breach the blockade. Paz sued {{to share in the}} proceeds on two grounds: first, that the two British vessels were engaged in a joint enterprise, and second, that Paz had been in sight {{at the time of the}} capture. The court ruled that Lord George Stuart, who commanded the station at Heligoland, had sent the two British vessels out with parallel, but not joint orders. It further ruled that there was no independent evidence that Paz had been in sight. The court therefore denied the claim. The case was nevertheless important in that it helped define the meaning of blockade.|$|E

[...] "Characters {{go up and down}} on-stage escalators, and the set spins to show various areas of the lounge and terminal. There is a dissection of a small, white furry animal, a large snake, some allusions to Bond girls and character transformations. The Christians pull guns on the Muslims at a signing ceremony".

A concert version of Rinaldo was given at the 2009 Edinburgh Festival, by the Bach Collegium Japan conducted by Masaaki Suzuki, with the Japanese soprano Maki Mori as Almirena.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, Marshall rejoined Jarrett in the WWF. At the {{beginning}} of her WWF career, known simply as Debra, she played the part of a shrewd businesswoman, wearing business suits.

During the match, Debra hit Goldust over the head with Jarrett's trademark guitar, enabling Jarrett to win. WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels, however, disqualified Jarrett, and Debra had to strip due to the match's stipulations. As she stripped, The Blue <b>Blazer</b> <b>and</b> Jarrett covered her up. Debra, however, began utilizing a new strategy during matches, distracting Jarrett's opponents by unbuttoning her blouse.

A private funeral Mass was held on Saturday, January 26, 2013, at the New Cathedral in St. Louis, televised locally by KTVI and KPLR as well as Fox Sports Midwest on pay-television. New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who in his first episcopal post served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Saint Louis, was the principal celebrant, and Knoxville's Bishop Richard F. Stika, Musial's former parish priest, was the homilist. Bob Costas gave the principal eulogy, calling him [...] "the genuine hero who as the years and decades passed, and disillusionment came from other directions, never once let us down", and quoting fellow Cooperstown honoree Mickey Mantle, who once said that Musial [...] "was a better player than me {{because he was a}} better man than me".|$|E

500|$|Every weekday (except for Wednesday) {{begins with}} a chapel service. School is held on Saturday mornings, with many {{sporting}} fixtures taking place on Saturday afternoons. There is an exeat weekend every term when pupils get respite from Saturday school. The Sunday chapel service is compulsory for boarding pupils. Homework, which is always referred to as [...] "prep", (short for preparatory work) is set for every day {{with the exception of}} Sunday. During weekdays there is a mid-morning coffee break for all pupils when refreshments are provided, a tradition from when many day pupils would arrive at that time from outlying settlements. The school uniform is traditional, including a black <b>blazer</b> <b>and</b> a tie. Merits are given as rewards for outstanding work. Punishments include weekday afternoon detention and Saturday afternoon detention. Corporal punishment had to be phased out by 1987 in line with state schools, as it received public funding. The headmaster is aided in his running of the school by the monitor (prefect) system. As well as the standard subjects, Latin, Classics, Ancient History, Greek, German and Spanish are taught. The school has a strong reputation for sciences. In 2011 the Independent Schools Inspectorate described the school's ethos as [...] "traditionally unpretentious".|$|E

The video consists of Jackson's and Tucker's characters trying to gain a woman's (Kishaya Dudley) affection by subsequently following her around the neighborhood. The video for [...] "You Rock My World" [...] {{was thought to be}} the last music video to feature any participation from Jackson before the video for [...] "One More Chance" [...] was unearthed (his following videos would consist of archive footage of himself and others). The video has been compared to Jackson's previous 1980s music videos for his singles, [...] "Smooth Criminal" [...] (1987), [...] "Bad" [...] (1987), and [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel" [...] (1987), all from his 1987 studio album, Bad.

500|$|On August 10, 2013, two {{snippets of}} the song leaked online. Gaga urged fans to [...] "please take these down as much as possible" [...] and {{provided}} {{instructions on how to}} report information regarding the unauthorized distribution of her song to her label's parent company, Universal Music Group. In response, fans reported websites seen distributing or linking to the snippets of the single, with nearly 2,500 individuals sending a singular link to Universal's takedown page. However, despite such efforts, a leak was eminent. So Gaga released the song a week early onto various radio stations across America. The single was made available in most countries just before midnight (EST) on the iTunes Store, coupled with a pre-order of Artpop. Following day, Gaga was seen in goth costume with clown-like face paint similar to the [...] "Applause" [...] artwork, at various promotional events. The Huffington Post compared the style-shift to Marilyn Manson, saying: [...] "With her black hair slicked back, a face full of white powder and her black <b>blazer</b> <b>and</b> shirt combo, Gaga could have easily been mistaken for Manson if it wasn't for her towering heels." [...] Gaga also premiered a short clip of [...] "Applause" [...] that quoted harsh journalism that attacked her credibility as an artist. In the video, Gaga was seen sitting naked in a white room and wearing a transparent visor. The sound of an audience booing and jeering was heard in the background. Direct quotations from critics and detractors appeared {{at the bottom of the}} video, which included: [...] "Lady Gaga is over"and [...] "Do not buy Lady Gaga's new single 'Applause'". The clip was construed as an attempt at reverse psychology.|$|E
500|$|Austin in turn penned [...] "Creep" [...] {{and thought}} she would be its perfect lead. He wrote the song while {{cruising}} in a Chevrolet <b>Blazer</b> <b>and</b> {{wanted it to be}} written from a female perspective. This experience was said to create [...] "a new mold" [...] of songwriting for him, as he was [...] "talking about stuff guys didn't know girls did." [...] The [...] "female point-of-view" [...] on the track was something the trio appreciated because as a group they have always portrayed themselves as feminists, the song goes along with that mentality. But still, on the 2013 VH1 biopic , the track also appeared to have been also inspired by Austin's infidelity to then-girlfriend, member Rozonda [...] "Chilli" [...] Thomas. Latoya Peterson of Spin observed that feminism was being loudly maligned in music {{at the time of the}} song's release, as a result, more female artists like TLC, Salt-N-Pepa and Tori Amos began to [...] "overtly defend themselves." [...] When asked if they were getting inspired from Radiohead's 1992 track with the same name, the group denied this. Andy Greene from Rolling Stone had pointed out that the group took the term [...] "" [...] in a different direction compared to Radiohead's or Stone Temple Pilots' 1993 single's, in which the trio's song is about getting revenge on a cheating guy by having an affair. The idea, however, was considered to be quite [...] "controversial." [...] According to Thomas, the theme didn't come as much of a shock for them, she stated: [...] "I think when we first came out, it was very bold of us to have a song called 'Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg' with [...] 'Two inches or a yard, rock hard or if it's sagging'. People totally understood what type of group we were. To sing a song like 'Creep' wouldn't be surprising from us." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{is based on}} a {{boarding}} school revolt. The video starts off with flash images of the exterior of an old school building. It then cuts to two separate lines of male and female students, the latter being led by Lisa and Jessica, marching down a school corridor. They were led by a teacher with a whip in her hand while being watched on surveillance cameras. The scene then shifts to the male students walking past a sign that says [...] "no girls beyond this point". The first verse then begins and the students are marching into a classroom and sit at individual tables. When the chorus begins, Lisa and Jessica are standing on a stage in front of their band performing for rows of still students who stare back blankly. When the second verse begins the students are in the classroom while guards patrol its perimeter and the teacher hits a blackboard with a pointing stick. During the second chorus Lisa and Jessica get their band members together in a toilet to start their rebellion at the school. When the bridge starts smash cuts are shown of them taking over the school's PA system, and the students getting up from their chairs in the classrooms and throwing objects at a teacher {{standing in front of a}} blackboard. The video ends with everyone running down stairs out of the school, with Jessica and Lisa leading the way. The scenes are inter cut to scenes of Lisa and Jessica holding each other. They are dressed in tartan skirts with the former wearing a black cardigan and an open collared shirt, and the latter a black <b>blazer</b> <b>and</b> a shirt with a tartan patterned skinny tie. Both the cardigan and blazer have a striped crest with a pink [...] "V" [...] in the middle.|$|E
