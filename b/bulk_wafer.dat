30|$|Graphene, {{a single}} layer of sp 2 -bonded carbon atoms {{arranged}} in a honeycomb lattice, has attracted much attention as a promising material in electronics and photonics. This is mainly due to its giant carrier mobility (200, 000  cm 2 /Vs) [1], high thermal conductivity, and high mechanical strength [2 – 4], {{as well as to}} its adaptability in integrated planar technology.

Among these proposed methods, the EG method is considered preferable in that it not only allows growth of large-area graphene but also yields a well-defined graphene/substrate interface. This is because the method consists entirely of conventional thermal processes and is thus free from transfer of graphene onto substrates, unlike mechanical exfoliation and CVD methods, which sometimes causes the onset of wrinkles in graphene and residual impurities at the interface.

40|$|To {{answer the}} {{challenge}} of less expensive renewable electricity, the photovoltaics community is focusing on producing thinner silicon solar cells. A few years ago, {{in the field of}} silicon-on-nothing structures, micron-thick monocrystalline layers suspended over their parent wafer were produced by high-temperature annealing of specific arrays of macropores. Those macropores reorganise into one single void and leave a thin overlayer on top. Since this method may be an inexpensive way of fabricating high-quality silicon films, this paper investigates its potential for photovoltaic applications. In particular, we investigated if large surfaces can be produced and transferred to foreign substrates with this method. We fabricated basic solar cells, without rear-surface passivation, on 5 cm x 5 cm-large and 1 -mu m-thick films transferred to glass, that showed energy-conversion efficiencies up to 2. 6 %. These cells demonstrate the feasibility of the presented concept as a layer-transfer process for solar-cell application. After formation by annealing, the film is only barely attached to its parent wafer, but can still safely be handled provided that any abrupt gas flow or pumping to vacuum is avoided. After transfer and permanent bonding, the sample can be handled as any <b>bulk</b> <b>wafer.</b> (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|Semiconductor {{nanowires}} are {{now widely}} implemented as active elements in devices for various {{applications such as}} energy harvesting [1, 2], microelectronics [3], or sensors [4, 5]. In order to achieve high performances, high densities of nanowires are required to increase efficiency or sensitivity of devices [6, 7]. In this purpose, top-down etching of a semiconductor wafer is {{the most commonly used}} technique [7 – 9]. However, the requirement of a <b>bulk</b> <b>wafer</b> prevents the realization of cost-effective devices. Some groups therefore choose to use bottom-up techniques and produce nanowires using catalytic processes such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [10 – 12], allowing the growth of nanowires on noncrystalline substrates [13, 14]. However, the production of high-density arrays of aligned nanowires is challenging with this technique because it requires a control of the density and localization of the metallic catalyst seeds. Furthermore, if the substrate is not oriented in the preferential growth direction, it is impossible to achieve arrays with aligned nanowires because of their random orientations on the substrate. Various solutions are investigated to create high-density networks of nanowires using a bottom-up approach. For instance, dense networks of gold droplets can be realized by dewetting a thin layer of gold deposited on the surface of a substrate [15], but the density is not as high as with top-down techniques, {{and the size of the}} catalyst particles is hardly controlled. Another interesting solution is to lithographically pattern a substrate with catalyst particles [16, 17], which is time and money consuming in the case of e-beam lithography to achieve nanoscale dimensions.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPrecise {{quantitative}} assessment of c-Si wafer quality is of crucial importance for the development and manufacturing of high efficiency solar cells. For this purpose, lifetime samples are typically fabricated with very well cleaned and passivated surfaces. Under those conditions the measured effective lifetime τeff is almost equal to the silicon <b>bulk</b> <b>wafer</b> lifetime τwafer, i. e. a material related quality parameter. Those lifetime measurements are typically carried out with a photo-conductance decay method (PCM) e. g. with a Sinton-WCT tool. The measurement result is an effective excess carrier lifetime τeff which typically exhibits a strong dependence on the excess carrier injection density Δn within the wafer. Stating τeff –values thus necessitates to specifiy Δn. The PV community typically reports at a fixed Δn {{in the range of}} 1 × 1014  cm- 3 to 1 × 1016  cm- 3 or for varying wafer doping density Ndop at Δn = Ndop/ 10. The latter allows for a comparison {{from the point of view}} of the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) formalism. Unfortunately, the impact of a certain lifetime for device performance changes with Ndop, due to the law of mass action. In this paper a wafer doping density dependent Δn which is relevant for the injection density at maximum power point (MPP) is derived. This Δn@MPP shows a contrary behaviour compared to the often used and accepted reporting method to set Δn = Ndop/ 10. Additionally, a wafer doping density independent material quality parameter, called material saturation current density j 0,mat at MPP, is proposed to improve the comparability of measured effective lifetimes of differently doped wafers...|$|E

40|$|Doping {{profiles}} in silicon greatly determine electrical performances of microelectronic devices and are frequently engineered to manipulate device properties. To support engineering studies afterward, essential information is usually required for physically characterized doping profiles. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), spreading resistance profiling (SRP) and electrochemical capacitance voltage (ECV) profiling are mainstream techniques for now to measure doping profiles destructively. SIMS produces a chemical doping profile through the ion sputtering process and owns a better characterization resolution. ECV and SPR, {{on the other}} hand, gauge an electrical doping profile from the free carrier detection in microelectronic devices. The major discrepancy between chemical and electrical profiles is at heavily doped (3 ̆e 1020 atoms / cm 3) regions. At the profile region over the solubility limit, inactive dopants induce a flat plateau and only being detected by electrical measurements. Destructive techniques are usually designed as stand-alone systems for the remote usage. For an in-situ process control purpose, non-contact approaches, such as non-contact capacitance-voltage (CV) and ellipsometry techniques, are currently under developing. In this dissertation, novel terahertz time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is adopted to achieve an electrical doping profile measurement in both destructive and non-contact manners. For this brand new application, everything has been studied from bottom-up. Firstly, the measurement uncertainty from the change of a <b>bulk</b> <b>wafer</b> thickness and {{the recognition of the}} doping profile dissimilarity were proven experimentally. The phosphorus refractive index from 1. 2 × 1015 cm- 3 to 1. 8 × 1020 cm- 3 levels was then generated physically for the modeling of the complex THz transmission and its shift to the Drude Model prediction is explained two scientific mechanisms. Through the experimental demonstrated of the proactical degeneracy, relative strategies were proposed to shrink or break it. The doping profile measurement was finally performed by both methods. We conclude that THz-TDS can be designed as either an either in-situ or stand-alone system to estimate a doping profile in semiconductor materials...|$|E

The Interdigitated Back Contact Silicon Hetero-Junction (IBC-SHJ) {{solar cell}} {{combines}} {{the advantages of}} high open-circuit voltage of SHJ device and no front electrical shading of IBC device to achieve the very high efficiency potential. Most recently 25. 6 % IBC-SHJ device has been announced by Panasonic (formerly Sanyo) which is the highest efficiency of single junction photovoltaic device under one sun condition. However, the p and n regions on the rear side of the IBC-SHJ device usually require multi-steps of photolithography process and/or fine photolithography masks, which is very elaborate and not suitable for large scale industrial production. In order to eliminate or reduce the complexity of IBC-SHJ solar cell fabrication, the application of two laser-based patterning processes, namely laser fired contact (LFC) and laser isolation, are being studied in this thesis. Laser fired contacts to n-type crystalline silicon were developed by investigating novel metal stacks containing Antimony (Sb). Lasing conditions {{and the structure of}} metals stacks were optimized for lowest contact resistance and minimum surface damage. Specific contact resistance for firing different metal stacks through either silicon nitride or p-type amorphous silicon was determined using two different models and test structures. Specific contact resistance values of 2 - 7 mΩ cm 2 have been achieved. Recombination loss due to laser damage was consistent with an extracted local surface recombination velocity (SRV) of ~ 20, 000 cm/s that is similar to values for laser fired base contact for p-type crystalline silicon. Both direct laser isolation and laser-chemical isolation were studied as rear side patterning technique for IBC-SHJ cells. Shunt resistance > 5, 600 Ω cm was obtained by direct laser isolation at the cost of significant surface passivation loss and <b>bulk</b> <b>wafer</b> damage. Shunt resistance > 16, 000 Ω cm was achieved with laser chemical isolation while lifetime of test structure sample still maintain above 1700 us.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{photoluminescence}} spectra of n-doped InP <b>bulk</b> <b>wafers,</b> {{both in the}} reflection and the transmission geometries relative to the excitation beam. From the observed spectra we estimate the spatial distribution of minority carriers allowing for the spectral filtering due to re-absorption of luminescence in the wafer. This distribution unambiguously demonstrates a non-exponential drop-off with distance from the excitation region. Such a behavior evidences an anomalous photon-assisted transport of minority carriers enhanced owing to the high quantum efficiency of emission. It is shown that the transport conforms very well to the so-called Levy-flights process corresponding to a peculiar random walk that does not reduce to diffusion. The index gamma of the Levy flights distribution {{is found to be}} in the range gamma = 0. 64 to 0. 79, depending on the doping. Thus, we propose the high-efficiency direct-gap semiconductors as a remarkable laboratory system for studying the anomalous transport. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} thin gate oxides grown on {{separation}} by implantation of oxygen substrates was examined. The basic mechanisms for time dependent breakdown {{were shown to}} be the same as oxides grown on bulk substrates, while detailed I-V characteristics of the gate oxide indicates that there can be more oxide trapped charges, most likely caused by the material defects of silicon on insulator wafers, that do not significantly reduce the charge-to-breakdown (Qbd) value. However, by examining the early-failure-rate, the catastrophic gate oxide defect density can be deduced. A similar study was also performed to evaluate the buried oxide quality. Infroduction In spite of its various advantages for low power and high speed applications, 1 - 3 several remaining problems should be resolved to make silicon-on-insulator (SOl) technology a mainstream technology. First, the SOT material must be improved to have a quality comparable with <b>bulk</b> <b>wafers.</b> The integrity of the thin gate oxide and buried oxide are two of the most important issues because of their impac...|$|R
