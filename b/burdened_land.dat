50|$|An {{equitable}} servitude is a {{term used}} in the law of real property to describe a nonpossessory interest in land that operates much like a covenant running with the land. However, covenants and equitable servitudes should not be confused. One may tell the difference based on the remedy plaintiff seeks. Holders of a covenant seek money damages, but holders of equitable servitudes seek injunctions. In England, when a party is forbidden from certain use, the covenant is called equitable servitude.

40|$|Despite England’s growing {{international}} trading wealth, {{an expanding}} secondary sector, and more productive agriculture the mid-seventeenth century state with its outdated tax system was politically and militarily weak. Civil war {{and its aftermath}} created the urgent and protracted supply need which instigated the creation and honing of radically new effective tax forms and processes which proved indispensable during the Restoration and beyond. Drawing on Kent, London and Bristol case studies this thesis explores how the land tax became a mainstay of an increasingly powerful early modern English state by considering its administration, processes and tax mechanics from its 1643 inception to the excise crisis. Economic development offered fiscal opportunity and whilst the excise exploited product supply chains, the land tax targeted rent and income generated from agricultural, commercial and domestic real estate. Occupiers and landlords shared immediate fiscal <b>burdens.</b> <b>Land</b> taxes exploited cashflows around financial and seasonal production cycles, particularly in the more commercialised South and East, where fresh {{attempts were made to}} value and tax land. Effective local governors had for decades bolstered their own authority by delivering national initiatives and now worked in partnership with legislators to nurture the new tax and create resilience. The state’s bargain was that parliament would determine deadlines and fixed tax amounts from each locale, but local governors had immediate process ownership to determine its detailed application. Continued fiscal success required fresh waves of innovation, adaption and involvement including: empowerment, delegation, the deployment of more experienced officials, simplification, and improved stakeholder oversight. As post-Revolutionary conflict drove fiscal <b>burdens</b> higher, <b>land</b> taxes became a permanent fiscal implement of the state, despite regular outbreaks of political angst at the tax’s power. The resulting coordinated collective commitment {{of tens of thousands of}} officials, across county, city and country, was the great fiscal achievement of the age; a picture long obscured by institutionalised state narratives.

40|$|Empirical {{monitoring}} {{studies of}} catchment-scale Escherichia coli <b>burden</b> to <b>land</b> from agriculture are scarce. This {{is not surprising}} given the complexity associated with the temporal and spatial heterogeneity in the excretion of livestock faecal deposits and variability in microbial content of faeces. However, such information is needed to appreciate better how land management and landscape features impact on water quality draining agricultural landscapes. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop and test a field-based protocol for determining the burden of E. coli in a small headwater catchment in the UK. Predictions of E. coli burden using an empirical model based on previous best estimates of excretion and shedding rates were also evaluated against observed data. The results indicated that an empirical model utilising key parameters was able to satisfactorily predict E. coli burden on pasture most of the time, with 89 % of observed values falling within the minimum and maximum range of predicted values. In particular, the overall temporal pattern of E. coli burden on pasture is captured by the model. The observed and predicted values recorded a disagreement of > 1 order of magnitude on only one of the nine sampling dates throughout an annual period. While a first approximation of E. coli <b>burden</b> to <b>land,</b> this field-based protocol represents one of the first comprehensive approaches for providing a real estimate of a dynamic microbial reservoir at the headwater catchment scale and highlights the utility of a simple dynamic empirical model for a more economical prediction of catchment-scale E. coli burden...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{explores the}} {{lawfulness}} of servitudes on personal property in both common law and intellectual property regimes. The common law has from ancient times recognized the general right of owners of real property to <b>burden</b> <b>land</b> with {{restrictions on use}} [...] restrictions that 2 ̆ 2 run with the land 2 ̆ 2 [...] subject to various conditions and limitations. It has been more ambivalent about similar restrictions on personal property. Why? That question was broached seventy-five years ago by Zechariah Chafee, though he never fully answered it. Today, the question has acquired a new importance because of the pervasive use of computer software licensing restrictions that, for all practical purposes, {{can be regarded as}} a form of property servitude. Software licensing restrictions implicate specialized rules of intellectual property, such as the first sale doctrine. However, those rules are basically derived from common law policies (most notably policies against restraints on alienation and restraints of trade), so the question about the legality of such restrictions is essentially no different for intellectual property from that question in the context of personal property at common law. This Article argues that the traditional hostility to use and resale restraints on personal property is misguided in both the common law and intellectual property contexts. While there may be legitimate reasons for limiting an owner 2 ̆ 7 s right to impose post-transfer restrictions on use and resale, those reasons are more exceptional than has been commonly assumed. Moreover, in the new digital world where servitude-type restrictions can be engineered into the architecture of the property itself, public policy restrictions on contractual 2 ̆ 2 servitudes 2 ̆ 2 may prove to be ineffectual, creating a new reason to take a fresh look at old conceptions of personal property servitudes...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{how and why}} ethnic minorities are poorer than ethnic majorities in Vietnam using the VHLSS data for 2002 and 2004. First, the analysis confirms that households belonging to the ethnic minority groups are not only poorer but also more vulnerable to various shocks {{than those in the}} ethnic majority groups, namely the Kinh and the Chinese. Second, household composition (e. g. dependency <b>burden),</b> education, <b>land</b> holding, and location are important determinants of expenditure and poverty, whilst there is some diversity among different ethnic groups. Finally, the decomposition analyses reveal that the ethnic minorities are poorer not necessarily because they have more disadvantaged household characteristics (e. g. educational attainment or location), but, more importantly, because the returns to the characteristics are much lower for ethnic minorities than for majorities. Government policies to reduce structural differences between ethnic majorities and minorities are imperative to address the disparities in returns to endowments between them. ...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{management}} of diffuse microbial water pollution from agriculture requires a fundamental {{understanding of how}} spatial patterns of microbial pollutants, e. g.

The {{aim of this study}} was to apply the Visualising Pathogen & Environmental Risk (ViPER) model, developed to predict E. coli <b>burden</b> on agricultural <b>land,</b> in a spatially distributed manner to two contrasting catchments in order to map and understand changes in E. coli <b>burden</b> contributed to <b>land</b> from grazing livestock. The model was applied to the River Ayr and Lunan Water catchments, with significant correlations observed between area of improved grassland and the maximum total E. coli per 1 km 2 grid cell (Ayr: r = 0. 57; p < 0. 001, Lunan: r = 0. 32; p < 0. 001). There was a significant difference in the predicted maximum E. coli burden between seasons in both catchments, with summer and autumn predicted to accrue higher E. coli contributions relative to spring and winter (P < 0. 001), driven largely by livestock presence. The ViPER model thus describes, at the landscape scale, spatial nuances in the vulnerability of E. coli loading to land as driven by stocking density and livestock grazing regimes. Resulting risk maps therefore provide the underpinning evidence to inform spatially-targeted decision-making with respect to managing sources of E. coli in agricultural environments...|$|R
