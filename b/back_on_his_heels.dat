6000|$|Or I {{would see}} him on some parterre of a {{platform}} beside my aunt's hurraying hat, amidst titles and costumes, [...] "holding his end up," [...] as he would say, subscribing heavily to obvious charities, even at times making brief convulsive speeches in some good cause before the most exalted audiences. [...] "Mr. Chairman, your Royal Highness, my Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen,"`he would begin amidst subsiding applause and adjust those obstinate glasses and thrust back the wings of his frock-coat and rest his hands upon his hips and speak his fragment with ever and again an incidental Zzzz. His hands would fret about him as he spoke, fiddle his glasses, feel in his waistcoat pockets; ever and again he would rise slowly to his toes as a sentence unwound jerkily like a clockwork snake, and drop <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> at the end. They were the very gestures of our first encounter when he had stood before the empty fireplace in his minute draped parlour and talked of my future to my mother.|$|E

Despite modest success in the UK, The Silencers had an almost fanatical {{following}} in mainland Europe, especially France and Spain. In more recent years the band were best known for supplying the theme music of a popular advertising campaign for VisitScotland. Burns was once described by fellow band member Jimme O'Neill as [...] "a dark, smouldering presence, rocking slowly <b>back</b> and forwards <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>heels,</b> caressing jagged, bittersweet melodies from his black Les Paul." ...|$|R
60|$|Hall had reappeared, {{the great}} jump accomplished, and was running shoreward. But {{there was no}} gap. Billy was <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>heels,</b> and <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> he stayed, in to shore, down the wall, and to the mark on the beach. Billy had won by half a minute.|$|R
6000|$|I noted him {{in great}} detail. I {{remember}} now his partially unbuttoned waistcoat, as though something {{had occurred to}} distract him as he did it up, and a little cut upon his chin. I liked a certain humour in his eyes. I watched, too, with the fascination that things have for an observant boy, the play of his lips--they were a little oblique, {{and there was something}} [...] "slipshod," [...] if one may strain a word so far, about his mouth, so that he lisped and sibilated ever and again and the coming and going of a curious expression, triumphant in quality it was, upon his face as he talked. He fingered his glasses, which did not seem to fit his nose, fretted with things in his waistcoat pockets or put his hands behind him, looked over our heads, and ever and again rose to his toes and dropped <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>heels.</b> He had a way of drawing air in at times through his teeth that gave a whispering zest to his speech It's a sound I can only represent as a soft Zzzz.|$|E
5000|$|Many Western historians, such as Heribert Busse and Neal Robinson, {{agree that}} Jerusalem is the {{originally}} intended {{interpretation of the}} Qurâ€™an. Muslims used to pray towards Jerusalem, {{but according to the}} following verses of their Quran, God changed this direction, the Qiblah, to instead direct to al-Masjid al-Haram: And thus we have made you a just community that you will be witnesses over the people and the Messenger will be a witness over you. And We did not make the qiblah which you used to face except that We might make evident who would follow the Messenger from who would turn <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>heels.</b> And indeed, it is difficult except for those whom Allah has guided. And never would Allah have caused you to lose your faith. Indeed Allah is, to the people, Kind and Merciful. We have certainly seen the turning of your face, Muhammad, toward the heaven, and We will surely turn you to a qiblah with which you will be pleased. So turn your face toward al-Masjid al-Haram. And wherever you believers are, turn your faces toward it prayer. Indeed, those who have been given the Scripture well know that it is the truth from their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what they do. Quran ...|$|E
5000|$|As the Flyers {{prepared}} {{a run at}} the championship for a third consecutive year, Parent was sidelined by a pre-season neck injury requiring surgery and he appeared in only 11 games in 1975-76. Parent had pinched a nerve in his neck causing radiating pain. Doctors removed a disk and a section of bone hoping to alleviate the symptoms but Parent suffered from continued pain in his neck throughout the rest of his career. [...] He returned to the lineup late in the season but he was inconsistent and could not regain the starting job from netminder Wayne Stephenson. Without Parent's Conn Smythe level performance that year, the Flyers fell in the Stanley Cup finals in four straight games to the Montreal Canadiens. Over the next three seasons, he experienced difficulties at times. Hockey was changing from a defense oriented game to one that favored high scoring. Snipers like Mike Bossy, Guy Lafleur and Steve Shutt were becoming major stars and dominating play. Plante, although in retirement, continued to have a strong influence on Parent's career. Parent, like Plante, was a stand-up type goalie. At one point Parent was playing poorly and considering retirement. Plante watched him practice in Philadelphia for two days, then told Parent exactly what he was doing wrong: sitting <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>heels,</b> backing into his crease and losing concentration. Parent heeded Plante's advice and returned to form. During the 1977-1978 season, he adopted the more confident, challenging style characteristic of his play during the Championship years posting a 2.22 GAA, a 0.912 save percentage and a league leading 7 shutouts in 49 games. However, as the 1970s were drawing to a close, the era of the stand-up goaltender was coming to an end. The never before seen goal scoring totals of the early 1980s eventually forced a revolution in goaltender style and play. The butterfly style of Patrick Roy became the dominant style and the stand-up style of Parent and Plante became a relic of the NHL past. Parent is {{considered by many to be}} the last great stand-up goaltender.|$|E
