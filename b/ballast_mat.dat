40|$|The use of {{elastomeric}} particles {{obtained from}} old tires to produce anti-vibration mats to reduce vibrations in railways is studied. In {{the first part}} of this work a numerical simulation for dimensioning the element has been performed. The behavior for a wavy surface was deducted obtaining good approximation to the empirical results. In the second part the methodology used to assess the Insertion Loss, IL, provided by the anti-vibration system is described. The analytical superstructure/ground model developed within the frame of the project is presented. The model is based on an elementary superstructure model with no elastomeric material and is conveniently modified to introduce an under <b>ballast</b> <b>mat.</b> Finally the study shows the validation of the mechanical behavior of prototype mats under dynamic efforts according to standards [1 - 6].

40|$|In Australia, {{increasing}} demand for High Speed Rail (HSR) and heavier freight transport is a technical and economic challenge for practicing engineers, designers and researchers. Because of this increased train speed and axle load, high undue stresses are {{transferred to the}} ballast and underlying formation. Ballast degradation {{is a major factor}} affecting track longevity and stability. Use of energy absorbing shock mats to reduce noise and vibrations is an established practice. The shock mat is sometimes called as Under Sleeper Pad (USP) and Under <b>Ballast</b> <b>Mat</b> (UBM) depending upon their placement position. However, studies to analyse their effectiveness in minimising ballast degradation are limited. A series of large-scale laboratory tests were conducted on ballast using a high-capacity drop-weight impact testing equipment to understand the performance of energy absorbing shock mats in the attenuation of impact loads and subsequent mitigation of ballast degradation. A numerical model was developed based on the modifed stress-dilatancy approach to capture particle breakage during impact loading. Model predictions are compared with laboratory results. This paper presents state-of-the-art review of laboratory studies and numerical modelling illustrating benefits of USPs and UBMs in the practice...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{demand for}} High Speed Rail (HSR) and fast heavy haul poses a serious {{challenge}} for stability of tracks on problematic ground. Ballast is a key track foundation material placed underneath the sleepers which provides structural support against high cyclic and impact stresses caused by moving trains. Degradation of ballast contributes to {{a large percentage of}} track maintenance costs apart from affecting longevity and stability. In recent years, use of elastometric soft pads underneath sleepers has become increasingly popular as means of reducing track damage. The 2 ̆ 7 shock mat 2 ̆ 7 placed under the sleeper is traditionally called Under Sleeper Pad (USP), and when it is placed under ballast, the term Under <b>Ballast</b> <b>Mat</b> (UBM) is often used. Currently there is lack of comprehensive assessment on the geotechnical behaviour of ballast using these artificial inclusions under impact and cyclic loading. In this study, a series of largescale laboratory tests were conducted to understand the performance of these energy absorbing 2 ̆ 7 shock mats 2 ̆ 7 in the attenuation of impact and cyclic stresses and subsequent mitigation of ballast degradation. Impact loads were simulated using a high-capacity drop-weight impact testing equipment, while the cyclic loads were simulated using a large-scale prismoidal process simulation test apparatus. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of laboratory studies and field trials demonstrating the benefits of USPs and UBMs in rail industry...|$|E
40|$|Elastic {{elements}} such as rail pads, under sleeper pads and under <b>ballast</b> <b>mats</b> are railway components that allow for a reduction in track deterioration and vibrations. And they are furthermore commonly used to obtain an optimal vertical stiffness of the infrastructure. However, the use of elastomeric materials can increase construction costs and the consumption of raw materials. Thus, the utilization of used tire layers offers an alternative to reuse an abundant waste reducing the cost of elastic elements. In addition, an innovator technique allows deconstructing tire layers without grinding up the material, reducing production costs {{at the same time}} that tire properties are remained. This research is focused on the study of the viability of developing elastic components from used tire layers by evaluating the influence of thickness, the resistance capacity of the elements and their behavior in a ballast box. Results indicate the ability of tire pads to manufacture elastic elements (rail pads, under sleeper pads and under <b>ballast</b> <b>mats)</b> to be used in railway tracks...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{outlines}} a vibration prediction tool, ScopeRail, {{capable of}} predicting in-door noise and vibration, within structures {{in close proximity}} to high speed railway lines. The tool is designed to rapidly predict vibration levels over large track distances, while using historical soil information to increase accuracy. Model results are compared to an alternative, commonly used, scoping model and it is found that ScopeRail offers higher accuracy predictions. This increased accuracy can potentially reduce the cost of vibration environmental impact assessments for new high speed rail lines. To develop the tool, a three-dimensional finite element model is first outlined capable of simulating vibration generation and propagation from high speed rail lines. A vast array of model permutations are computed to assess the effect of each input parameter on absolute ground vibration levels. These relations are analysed using a machine learning approach, resulting in a model that can instantly predict ground vibration levels in the presence of different train speeds and soil profiles. Then a collection of empirical factors are coupled with the model to allow for the prediction of structural vibration and in-door noise in buildings located near high speed lines. Additional factors are also used to enable the prediction of vibrations in the presence of abatement measures (e. g. <b>ballast</b> <b>mats</b> and floating slab tracks) and additional excitation mechanisms (e. g. wheelflats and switches/crossings) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to address to the providing an adequate noise and vibration solution, required for High Speed Rail while maintaining the stability criteria of the ChônAn station structure, he first constructed in Korean High Speed Railway. t The significant acoustic pressure level will be induced by the high speed trains passing-by. Therefore, the high level study of this case is necessary. The previously conducted, experimental program similar to ChônAn station was carefully examined in order to observe the compatibility and adaptation, and the finite elements methods was performed by elaborating a model of the station. The acoustic pressure level of 85 dB(A) inside the ChônAn station was expected, and the result from the analysis indicates that the spaces below concrete slab are not suitable for commercial purpose, thus installation of filtering systems (spring boxes containing viscous dampers, <b>ballast</b> <b>mats</b> and acoustic shield) are provided to reduce the effect of the noise and vibration to acceptable level of 55 dB(A). But, a major drawback of application of the previously conducted experimental results was that the actual effect of installation of filtering system was never been validated. Therefore, the acquisition of noise and vibration on the present structure were obtained and compared to the computer simulations. These predicted the behavior of the station reasonabl...|$|R
40|$|Rail track {{substructure}} (ballast, subballast and subgrade) is {{the most}} essential component of the railway system in view of track stability. The ballast is the largest component of the track substructure {{and it is the}} key load-bearing stratum packed with rock aggregates underneath and around the sleepers, thereby providing structural support against dynamic stresses caused by moving trains. However under large dynamic stresses exerted by heavy haul and high speed trains, the degradation of track substructure including ballast becomes significant. This in turn affects the track stability and creates frequent maintenance, thus increasing the life cycle cost of the rail network. Therefore, mitigating degradation of the ballast layer is vital in view of track longevity. In recent years, the use of resilient soft pads (shock mats) above the ballast (i. e. Under Sleeper Pad, USP) and below the ballast (i. e. Under <b>Ballast</b> <b>Mat,</b> UBM) has become a common practice. Many countries, including Australia have adopted the use of resilient pads in the rail track foundation. Currently, the studies on resilient mats are mostly limited to the reduction of vibration and noise. There is a lack of proper assessment of the geotechnical behavior of ballast when used along with shock mats. This paper provides an assessment of the triaxial behavior of the track substructure with and without shock mats under dynamic loading condition. A numerical model was developed based on the modified stress-dilatancy approach to capture the stress-strain and volume change behavior of ballast during impact loading. Model predictions are compared with laboratory results. It was found that the shock mats provide significant advantages in terms of reduced particle breakage and enhanced track stability...|$|E
40|$|The {{classical}} {{concepts of}} railway track analysis, such Beam on Elastic Foundation (BOEF), Winkler 2 ̆ 7 s theory or Zimmermann method are categorized as one-dimensional {{analysis of a}} railway structure and are simplification of a beam laid on a continuous support (soil 2 ̆ 7 s subgrade or foundation). These methods are still very useful for analyzing a simple design and analysis of railway track systems. Unfortunately, for doing a complex analysis of a railway track, these methods have lack of capabilities, since they only take into account one-dimensional system and neglect the actual discrete support provided by crossed sleeper, ballast, sub <b>ballast</b> <b>mat</b> and subgrade. Nowadays, the use of computer software for doing Finite Element Method (FEM) or Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of a structure is very common for engineers. FEA consists of {{a huge amount of}} complex calculations; therefore, a manual calculation by hand is almost impossible to be done. Hence, the use of computer software will be very useful in this manner. The applications of FEM using software also widen in the field of railway infrastructure design and analysis. There are many advantages of using FEM method using computer. However, related to its complexities, one should understands the concepts and “knows-how” to solve the problems, to idealize the structure into FEM model in computer, and to choose the suitable elements and its behaviours, and also the correct method. Thispaper is presented to discuss the basic theories behind the conventional and advanced ways of modelling of railway track system, to show the basic concepts of modelling railway track systems using FEM, to present two- and three-dimensional FEM models of railway superstructures which are built using software ANSYS, and to demonstrate the way of doing the verification of the results using Zimmermann method...|$|E
40|$|Railway track {{components}} {{located at}} bridge transition zones or approach areas suffer from impact load and vibrations caused by abrupt changes in track stiffness {{on the bridge}} and the subgrade. The numerous strategies {{that can be used}} to mitigate these abrupt track stiffness changes rely on one of two concepts. The first concept is that of providing a gradual stiffness change, and the second is that of equalizing the track stiffness. A number of such mitigation methods have been developed and implemented over recent decades. Construction activities associated with these methods require various materials, processes, and uses of time, costs, and carbon emissions. In this study, eight of the most common techniques for railway bridge transition mitigation, including under <b>ballast</b> <b>mats</b> (UBMs), soft baseplates, under sleeper pads (USPs), rail pads, embankment treatments, transition slabs, ballast bonding, and wide sleepers, are compared. This study benchmarks the costs and carbon emissions of these eight mitigation techniques over the 50 -year lifespan of a railway system subject to identical probabilities of four environmental scenarios: a control case, extremely high temperatures, extremely low temperatures, and flash flooding. This unprecedented study systemically investigates the effectiveness of the mitigation methods while considering the effects of 30 and 100 [*]m bridge span lengths. Our results indicate that railway engineers should adopt different mitigation methods for different scenarios. The soft baseplate is the most appropriate method for a short-span bridge in the control case and the case of flash flooding, while ballast bonding is better for long-span railway bridges. Embankment treatment is recommended for both high- and low-extreme temperatures. However, its applicability is limited when the differential track stiffness is extremely high. Hence, alternatives that are 5 – 25 % more expensive are proposed in parallel. The alternative methods include ballast bonding, and the USP and UMB methods, the latter two of which are designed for different climate scenarios. These recommendations translate novel insights from the systems thinking approach into practice and will benefit the railway industry significantly over the long term, enhancing both economic and environmental sustainability...|$|R
