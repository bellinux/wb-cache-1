5|$|Forty {{tanks of}} the 1st Brigade {{were to be}} used in the attack on the Third Army front, eight with XVIII Corps and sixteen each in VII Corps and VI Corps. When the blue line had been reached, four of the VII Corps tanks were to join VI Corps for its attack on the brown line. The <b>black</b> <b>line</b> (first objective) was not to be {{attacked}} by tanks, which were to begin the drive to the front line at zero-hour and rendezvous with infantry at the <b>black</b> <b>line</b> two hours later. The tanks were reserved for the most difficult objectives beyond the <b>black</b> <b>line</b> in groups of up to ten vehicles. Four tanks were to attack Neuville Vitasse, four against Telegraph Hill, four against The Harp and another four against Tilloy lez Mofflaines and two were to drive down the slope from Roclincourt west of Bois de la Maison Blanche. Once the blue line had fallen, the tanks still running were to drive to rally points.|$|E
5|$|Blek is a 2013 puzzle {{video game}} for iOS and Android by Kunabi Brother, {{a team of}} {{brothers}} Denis and Davor Mikan. The player draws a snakelike <b>black</b> <b>line</b> that recurs in pattern and velocity across the screen to remove colored dots and avoid black dots. It is minimalist in design, features excerpts of Erin Gee, and takes inspiration from Golan Levin, the Bauhaus, and Japanese calligraphy. The brothers designed the game as a touchscreen adaptation to classic game Snake and worked on the game for over six months. It was released in December 2013 for iPad, and was later released for other iOS devices and Android.|$|E

There are four longitudinal <b>black</b> <b>lines</b> and radiating <b>black</b> <b>lines</b> between the outer {{line and the}} edge of the mantle.

5|$|While the pugs {{that are}} {{depicted}} in eighteenth century prints {{tend to be}} long and lean, modern breed preferences are for a square cobby body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle. Their smooth and glossy coats can be fawn, apricot fawn, silver fawn, or black. The markings are clearly defined, {{and there is a}} trace of a <b>black</b> <b>line</b> extending from the occiput to the tail. The tail normally curls tightly over the hip.|$|E
5|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, and as {{originally}} described by , Rule 184 {{may be used to}} model deposition of particles onto a surface. In this model, one has a set of particles that occupy a subset of the positions in a square lattice oriented diagonally (the darker particles in the figure). If a particle is present at some position of the lattice, the lattice positions below and to the right, and below and {{to the left of the}} particle must also be filled, so the filled part of the lattice extends infinitely downward to the left and right. The boundary between filled and unfilled positions (the thin <b>black</b> <b>line</b> in the figure) is interpreted as modeling a surface, onto which more particles may be deposited. At each time step, the surface grows by the deposition of new particles in each local minimum of the surface; that is, at each position where it is possible to add one new particle that has existing particles below it on both sides (the lighter particles in the figure).|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{were long}} aware that Tursiops {{dolphins}} might consist {{of more than}} one species. Molecular genetics allowed much greater insight into this previously intractable problem. The IUCN acknowledges two species, although a third distinct species was described in 2011: the common bottlenose dolphin (T. truncatus) is found in most tropical to temperate oceans, and it has a grey color, with the shade of grey varying among populations, but it can be bluish-grey, brownish-grey, or even nearly black, and is often darker on the back from the rostrum to behind the dorsal fin; the Black Sea bottlenose dolphin (T. t. ponticus), a subspecies of T. truncatus lives in the Black Sea; The Pacific bottlenose dolphin (T. gillii or T. t. gillii), another subspecies of T. truncatus, lives in the Pacific, and has a <b>black</b> <b>line</b> from the eye to the forehead; the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (T. aduncus) lives in the waters around India, northern Australia, South China, the Red Sea, and the eastern coast of Africa, with the back being dark-grey and the belly being lighter grey or nearly white with grey spots; the Burrunan dolphin (T. australis), found in the Port Phillip and Gippsland Lakes areas of Victoria, Australia, was described in September 2011 after research showed it was distinct from T. truncatus and T. aduncus, but is not considered a separate species by the IUCN.|$|E

5|$|The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Canadian Divisions {{reported}} reaching and capturing {{their first}} objective, the <b>Black</b> <b>Line,</b> by 6:25am. The 4th Canadian Division encountered {{a great deal}} of trouble during its advance and was unable to complete its first objective until some hours later. After a planned pause, when the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Canadian Divisions consolidated their positions, the advance resumed. Shortly after 7:00am, the 1st Canadian Division captured the left half of its second objective, the Red Line and moved the 1st Canadian Brigade forward to mount an attack on the remainder. The 2nd Canadian Division reported reaching the Red Line and capturing the village of Les Tilleuls at approximately the same time. A mine explosion that killed many German troops of the Reserve Infantry Regiment 262 manning the front line preceded the advance of the 3rd Canadian Division. The remaining German troops could do no more than man temporary lines of resistance until later manning a full defence at the German third line. As a result, the southern section of the 3rd Canadian Division was able to reach the Red Line at {{the western edge of the}} Bois de la Folie at around 7:30am. At 9:00am the division learned of its exposed left flank, as the 4th Canadian Division had not yet captured Hill 145. The 3rd Canadian Division was thus called upon to establish a divisional defensive flank to its north. Although the German commanders were able to maintain open lines of communication and issue operating orders, even with swift staff work the tempo of the assault was such that German decision cycle was unable to react decisively.|$|E

25|$|The newly hatched {{caterpillar}} {{is about}} 0.5cm long and is yellowish green. In later instars the colour changes to a leafy green. The head is green and spotted with tiny black tubercules.

50|$|This nudibranch has a blue-whiite dorsum {{with four}} {{longitudinal}} <b>black</b> <b>lines</b> interspersed with raised ridges. It {{is a small}} Phyllidiid, growing to about 20 mm in length.

It is similar to Phyllidiopsis annae except for the colour of the rhinophores, which are black in that species. Phyllidiopsis phiphiensis is also similar but has three instead of four longitudinal <b>black</b> <b>lines</b> on the mantle.|$|R
25|$|The {{coloration}} of {{its body}} is orange to reddish-brown, {{but it can also}} be black in some particular areas such as the Northern Territory in Australia.

All the fins are also outlined with a fine <b>black</b> <b>line.</b> A. ocellaris is often confused with Amphiprion percula, which possesses exactly the same colours and patterns at first sight but distinguishes itself by the thickness of the black outlines. Additionally, A. ocellaris has a taller dorsal fin, and typically possesses 11 dorsal-fin spines vs. 10 spines in Amphiprion percula.|$|E

Forewing: {{the spots}} and {{markings}} {{with the exception}} of the basal black streaks as on the upperside, the ground colour fading to an ashy grey towards the terminal margin. Hindwing similar to the underside of hindwing of P. gambrisius, but the discal transverse sinuous <b>black</b> <b>line</b> very broken and incomplete, the postdiscal, subterminal and terminal black markings somewhat better denned. Antennae black; head, thorax and abdomen bronze green, barred with black above; beneath whitish.|$|E
25|$|T. attritum is 2.2mm long. It has a {{yellowish}} carapace with a <b>black</b> <b>line</b> all around. The sternum is yellow-orange {{with gray}} pigment, the legs are yellow with darker marks.
