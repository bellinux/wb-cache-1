The recommendation came during Budget Committee hearings {{on the distribution of}} $95.1 million in federal Community Development Block Grants. Mayor Washington's budget recommendation included a $20,000 grant to UCC to facilitate residents applying for home improvement loans. The UCC's service area included the adjoining 48th Ward, whose Alderman Kathy Osterman also supported the funding. Shiller requested that the committee deny the UCC its grant. Shiller accused the UCC of helping developers displace low-income Uptown residents. After heated debate, the Budget Committee voted 9–5 in favor of Shiller's amendment to remove the grant for the UCC.|$|E

First, new theoretical explanations (models) have been proposed where political <b>budget</b> <b>cycles</b> arise {{as the result of}} a moral hazard problem between the government and the electorate. Second, more sophisticated empirical methods, in particular, time series methods appropriate for dynamic panel data regressions, have been adopted in cross-country analyses. Last but not least, the focus of recent studies has shifted from industrialized countries to all (including developing) countries, and from the existence of political <b>budget</b> <b>cycles</b> to the magnitude and composition (revenue vs. spending) of these <b>cycles.</b> Political <b>budget</b> <b>cycles,</b> dynamic panel estimation, developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{literature}} on Political <b>Budget</b> <b>Cycles</b> has provided appealing evidence that their existence is conditional to country specific characteristics. In this paper we hypothesize {{that the level}} of social capital prevailing in a country might be an underlying fundamental reason that might be driving these results. We provide strong evidence that political <b>budget</b> <b>cycles</b> are only present in low social capital countries by utilizing a large panel data set for 63 democratic countries. We also show that the political <b>budget</b> <b>cycles</b> occur both in developing and developed countries under low social capital. Simultaneously, our results are robust under most other conditional effects considered by the literature. Finally, we also propose a theoretical model of conditional capital <b>budget</b> <b>cycles</b> by adapting a moral hazard model to account for different distributions of social capital. ...|$|R

40|$|Key words: {{political}} <b>budget</b> <b>cycles,</b> rational voters, two-dimensional {{asymmetric information}}, term limits. Abstract: Political <b>budget</b> <b>cycles</b> {{can be seen}} as a signaling game. This paper analyzes how asymmetric information in two dimensions affects the signaling game. Voters face a double uncertainty: they do not observe the competency and the character of politicians. Competency is the efficiency in running the government. Character is the degree of opportunism. Political <b>budget</b> <b>cycles</b> can lead to a separating equilibrium only if the degree of opportunism is low. Since the driving force of many political careers is to be reelected at almost all costs, a separating equilibrium does not exist. What can be expected instead is a semi-separating equilibrium.

40|$|The {{theorical}} {{literature on}} “Political Business Cycles ” presents important insights {{on the extent}} to which politicians attempt to manipulate government monetary and fiscal policies to influence electoral outcomes, in particular, with the aim of re-election. In recent years “Political <b>Budget</b> <b>Cycles</b> ” is the one of the most important topics in Political Business Cycles literature. According to Political <b>Budget</b> <b>Cycles</b> Theory, some components of the government budget are influenced by the electoral cycle and consequently an increase in government spending or decrease in taxes in an election year, leading to larger fiscal deficit. This incumbent’s fiscal manipulation is a tool that governments possess to increase their changes for re-election. In this paper we investigate the presence of Political <b>Budget</b> <b>Cycles</b> using a data set of budget balance, total expenditure and total revenue over the period 1994 – 2012. Our findings suggest that incumbents in Turkey use fiscal policy to increase their popularity and win elections, therefore fiscal manipulation was rewarded rather than punished by Turkish voters. The meaning of this result is that Political <b>Budget</b> <b>Cycles</b> Theory is valid for Turkey between 1994 and 2012...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{research on}} the theme of the political <b>budget</b> <b>cycles.</b> The goal is to find out whether or not the government tries to manipulate the state budget and its components for the purpose of re-election across the countries of the European Union. In order to verify this theory a dynamic panel data model was used. The results were significant, but only if predetermined elections were not counted into the estimations. In that case, the theory of the political <b>budget</b> <b>cycles</b> could be accepted as valid for the EU countries. The main driving force of the political <b>budget</b> <b>cycles</b> across the countries of the European Union is fluctuation of the government expenditures. During the election year, the government expenditures are higher, and a year after the election, government expenditures are lower. This is reflected into the state budget balance...|$|R
40|$|Do governments exploit {{international}} {{negotiations to}} increase their chances to get re-elected? This paper analyzes international political <b>budget</b> <b>cycles.</b> I argue that members of international organizations aim {{to increase their}} international monetary transfers above average levels in the preelection year assuming that they will appear politically competent to their voters if they increase their country’s position in the international bargaining game. Not all governments are equally competent, but they can pretend to be competent if bargaining in international organizations is based on reciprocity. The theory allows me to derive several empirical implications for opportunistic bargaining in the European Union, a region in which international distributional negotiations are highly salient for individuals in 27 member states. A time-series cross sectional analysis of EU member states from 1977 - 2006 supports the existence of conditional and unconditional <b>budget</b> <b>cycles</b> {{and points to the}} importance of accounting for international political <b>budget</b> <b>cycles</b> when analyzing electoral politics of governments around the globe...|$|R

The results show that election-year public spending shifts towards more visible current expenditures, in particular wages and subsidies, and away from capital expenditures. Furthermore, the findings suggest that electoral impacts on the allocation of public spending are likely to endure, even though countries gain experience in electoral politics.

We propose a moral hazard model of electoral competition to explain these differences. In the model, the sizes of the electoral <b>budget</b> <b>cycles</b> depend on the rents of remaining in power and the share of informed voters in the electorate.
