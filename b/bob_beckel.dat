5000|$|The show's [...] "anything goes" [...] {{attitude}} has led it into some minor controversies, particularly involving co-host <b>Bob</b> <b>Beckel's</b> on-air profanity and insensitive remarks. In August 2011, Beckel {{was forced to}} apologize on-air when, while trying to clarify an earlier remark wherein he called Michael Vick a [...] "redneck," [...] said the term was not racial, because [...] "blacks are rednecks, whites are rednecks, I was a redneck, Chinamen are rednecks." [...] Beckel was later compelled to apologize for using the term [...] "Chinamen." [...] Even the music the show's producers use to lead {{in and out of}} segments has raised hackles, such as an incident in 2011 that prompted a Twitter war between Adam Levine and various Fox News personalities, over producers' use of a Maroon 5 song.
