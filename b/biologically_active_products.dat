We have isolated, from bovine pancreas and ileum, chromogranin A fragments corresponding to a region giving rise to a <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>product,</b> pancreastatin. Phosphorylation patterns were determined by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and alkaline phosphatase digestion followed by ion-exchange chromatography and radioimmunoassay. In the pancreas, there were unmodified, mono- and di-phosphorylated forms of the fragment chromogranin A(248 - 313) with Arg and Glu at positions 293 and 301 respectively; in addition, there were small amounts of monophosphorylated peptide with an alternative primary sequence of His and Lys at 293 and 301 respectively. Two products of cleavage, pancreastatin and the fragment 297 - 313, were also found in unmodified and monophosphorylated forms. In the ileum, peptides with both alternative primary sequences were found, pancreastatin was absent, and phosphorylation was generally less than in the pancreas. Chromogranin A-derived peptides therefore exhibit tissue-specific patterns of phosphorylation and cleavage, and at least two phosphorylation sites occur in the region giving rise to a <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>product...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to its activation, ALOX5 must gain access to its polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) substrates, which commonly are bound in an ester linkage to the sn2 position of membrane phospholipids (see phospholipid), in order to form <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>products.</b> This is accomplished by a large family of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes. The cytosolic PLA2 set (i.e. cPLA2s) of PLA2 enzymes (cPLA2; see Phospholipase A2#Cytosolic phospholipases A2) in particular mediates many instances of stimulus-induced release of PUFA in inflammatory cells. For example, chemotactic factors stimulate human neutrophils to raise cytosolic Ca2+ which triggers cPLA2s, particularly the α isoform (cPLA2α), to move from its normal residence in the cytosol to cellular membranes. This chemotactic factor stimulation concurrently causes the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) which in turn stimulates the activity of cPLA2α by phosphorylating it on ser-505 (other cell types may activate this or other cPLA2 isoforms using other kinases which phosphorylate them on different serine residues). These two events allow cPLA2s to release PUFA esterified to membrane phospholipids to FLAP which then presents them to ALOX5 for their metabolism.|$|E
50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} is an enzyme which {{belongs to the}} subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family. The members of this family are proprotein convertases that process latent {{precursor}} proteins into their <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>products.</b> This encoded protein is a calcium-dependent serine endoprotease that can efficiently cleave precursor proteins at their paired basic amino acid processing sites. Some of its substrates are: proparathyroid hormone, transforming growth factor beta 1 precursor, proalbumin, pro-beta-secretase, membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase, beta subunit of pro-nerve growth factor and von Willebrand factor. A furin-like pro-protein convertase has been implicated in the processing of RGMc (also called hemojuvelin), a gene involved in a severe iron-overload disorder called juvenile hemochromatosis. Both the Ganz and Rotwein groups demonstrated that furin-like proprotein convertases (PPC) are responsible for conversion of 50 kDa HJV to a 40 kDa protein with a truncated COOH-terminus, at a conserved polybasic RNRR site. This suggests a potential mechanism to generate the soluble forms of HJV/hemojuvelin (s-hemojuvelin) found {{in the blood of}} rodents and humans.|$|E
50|$|Carcinoid tumors {{produce the}} {{vasoactive}} substance, serotonin. It is commonly, but incorrectly, thought that serotonin {{is the cause}} of the flushing. The flushing results from secretion of kallikrein, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of kininogen to lysyl-bradykinin. The latter is further converted to bradykinin, {{one of the most powerful}} vasodilators known. Other components of the carcinoid syndrome are diarrhea (probably caused by the increased serotonin, which greatly increases peristalsis, leaving less time for fluid absorption), a pellagra-like syndrome (probably caused by diversion of large amounts of tryptophan from synthesis of the vitamin B3 niacin, which is needed for NAD production, to the synthesis of serotonin and other 5-hydroxyindoles), fibrotic lesions of the endocardium, particularly on the right side of the heart resulting in insufficiency of the tricuspid valve and, less frequently, the pulmonary valve and, uncommonly, bronchoconstriction. The pathogenesis of the cardiac lesions and the bronchoconstriction is unknown, but the former probably involves activation of serotonin 5-HT2B receptors by serotonin. When the primary tumor is in the gastrointestinal tract, as it is in the great majority of cases, the serotonin and kallikrein are inactivated in the liver; manifestations of carcinoid syndrome do not occur until there are metastases to the liver or when the cancer is accompanied by liver failure (cirrhosis). Carcinoid tumors arising in the bronchi may be associated with manifestations of carcinoid syndrome without liver metastases because their <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>products</b> reach the systemic circulation before passing through the liver and being metabolized.|$|E
