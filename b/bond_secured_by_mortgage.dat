50|$|Historically, CalHFA has {{provided}} housing assistance in three areas: below-market interest rate mortgages and downpayment assistance for first-time homebuyers, {{most of whom}} were low- and moderate income families and ethnic minorities not well-served by market rate products, insurance for single-family home purchase mortgages, and loans for the development of multifamily rental housing. These financial products were funded through sale of revenue <b>bonds</b> <b>secured</b> <b>by</b> the <b>mortgage</b> products and the underlying property. The operating costs of the agency are paid by origination and service fees, and the difference between the interest paid on outstanding debt and the interest charged on the loans made. Beginning in 2002, passage of Proposition 46 (2002) provided funding for additional activities through sale of general obligation bonds. This source of funding was extended by passage of Proposition 1C (2006).|$|R
