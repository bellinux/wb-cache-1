5|$|Shortly {{after making}} {{the choice to}} include {{electronic}} drums and triggers, Peart added what has <b>become</b> <b>another</b> trademark of his kit: a rotating drum riser. During live Rush shows the riser allows Peart to swap the prominent portions of the kit (traditional acoustic in front, electronic in back). A staple of Peart's live drum solos has been the in-performance rotation-and-swap of {{the front and back}} kits as part of the solo itself. This special effect provides both a symbolic transition of drum styles within the solo and a visual treat for the audience.|$|E
5|$|Some Scotch bonnets have a {{completely}} smooth and glossy shell. This {{was thought to}} be a different species which was given the name cicatricosa by Gmelin in 1791. This taxon was recognized for a while, including up until 2010 as a separate species, Semicassis cicatricosa. However, in 2015 this is considered to be only a form, therefore S. cicatricosa has <b>become</b> <b>another</b> synonym of S. granulata.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the player accumulates mass by colliding their asteroid against other asteroids until enough mass has been gathered to become a small planet. From there, the player has to absorb other asteroids to make their planet grow enough to become a life planet; crashing against other objects will decrease the player's mass. At this point, life forms will evolve in the planet, creating spaceships, planetary shields and cannons. If the player wishes, they can accumulate more mass until their planet becomes a star. Life forms will disappear, but the player will be able to attract planets to form a solar system, further grow the star by absorbing other planets, or a combination of both. The player can also create multi-star systems by selecting planets from their system and make them absorb asteroids until they <b>become</b> <b>another</b> star.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} how much support there was for {{persecution}} within the aristocracy. After Gallienus's peace, Christians reached high ranks in Roman government. Diocletian appointed several Christians to those positions himself, {{and his wife}} and daughter may have been sympathetic to the church. There were many individuals willing to be martyrs, and many provincials willing to ignore any persecutory edicts from the emperors as well. Even Constantius was known to have disapproved of persecutory policies. The lower classes demonstrated little of the enthusiasm they had shown for earlier persecutions. They no longer believed the slanderous accusations that were popular in the 1st and 2nd centuries. Perhaps, as the historian Timothy Barnes has suggested, the long-established Church had <b>become</b> <b>another</b> accepted part of their lives.|$|E
5|$|King Sigismund Augustus' Dominium Maris Baltici program, {{aimed at}} {{securing}} Poland's {{access to and}} control over {{the portion of the}} Baltic region and ports that the country had vital interests in protecting, led to the Commonwealth's participation in the Livonian conflict, which had also <b>become</b> <b>another</b> stage in the series of Lithuania's and Poland's confrontations with Russia. In 1563 Ivan IV took Polotsk. After the Stettin peace of 1570 (which involved several powers, including Sweden and Denmark) the Commonwealth remained in control of the main part of Livonia, including Riga and Pernau. In 1577 Ivan undertook a great expedition, taking over for himself, or his vassal Magnus, Duke of Holstein most of Livonia, except for the coastal areas of Riga and Reval. A success of the Polish–Lithuanian counter-offensive became possible as Batory was able to secure the necessary funding from the nobility.|$|E

25|$|It is because, {{a nation}} which shared blood and history is clear, {{and just like}} my body can't be another's, the reason that a certain nation can't <b>become</b> <b>another</b> {{is the same as}} {{brothers}} living in the same house.

25|$|Since 1991 Canary Wharf, a {{few miles}} east of the City in Tower Hamlets, has <b>become</b> <b>another</b> centre for London's {{financial}} services industry which houses many banks and other institutions formerly located in the Square Mile.

25|$|Bullying {{behaviours}} in {{the workplace}} also exist among colleagues. They can be either the ‘target’ or perpetrator. If workplace bullying happens among the co-workers, witnesses will take sides, either with the target or the perpetrator. Perpetrators always win, because witnesses {{do not want to}} be the next target. This does encourage perpetrators to continue this behaviour. In addition, the sense of the injustice experienced by a target might lead that person to <b>become</b> <b>another</b> perpetrator who bullies other colleagues who have less power than they.|$|E

Instead of coordinating resources, ESAS had <b>become</b> <b>another</b> administrative level; there were also concerns from Norway that administrative and operative staff were leaking to the ESAS head office in Copenhagen and the OSAS head office in Stockholm, without any similar build-up of competence in Norway. Because of the way the costs were divided between the pool partners, DNL was also receiving smaller margins that the others.|$|E
