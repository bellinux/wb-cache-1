After {{the decision was made}} in mid-May, a spokesperson for ABC explained: [...] "We had always made clear from the beginning that significant safety precautions would need to be taken. This is the outcome of that." [...] Wallenda was not happy about the decision, stating [...] "It's disheartening—I wanted to do it without anything." [...] The Niagara Parks Commission indicated it was unaware of such a requirement when they were considering approval. [...] During the walk, Wallenda told his dad that he felt [...] "like a jackass" [...] wearing the harness. Many observers predicted he would remove the harness partway through the walk, but ultimately he did not do so. Before the crossing, Wallenda had promised that he only would remove the harness if it became a hazard during the walk. [...] "When I first found out about it, {{there was no doubt in}} my mind I was going to take it off", he later said. [...] "But as [...] got closer and closer, I realized I had to honor my word. I've always said I'm a man of integrity." [...] He also acknowledged that removing the harness would have created contractual problems with ABC. [...] "The way a TV network works, if something goes wrong, they fire people," [...] he said. [...] "If I would have dropped that tether, four people would have been fired because I'm too selfish to care or because it's all about me." [...] In addition to the harness, Wallenda wore a waterproof track suit and shoes custom made by his mother for the walk.

The most easily recognizable difference between <b>ballet</b> <b>shoes</b> and ghillies is that ghillies use laces to fasten them to the foot, whereas <b>ballet</b> <b>shoes</b> generally use an elastic across the ankle. Also the laces are very long, and are wrapped around the ankle and foot before tied. Other differences are that ghillies {{do not have a}} string/elastic {{around the edge of the}} shoe to tighten them, and the soles of ghillies are not usually stitched on, but glued on.|$|R

40|$|The {{conditions}} {{occurring in}} the dancer's forefoot {{can be divided into}} five categories. The three categories pre-sented in Part I of our study include those conditions occurring from poor training, those from chronic forefoot stresses, and those of static deformity. Five hundred dancers were observed for both symptomatic and asymp-tomatic forefoot conditions. It is most important that a young dancer have at least three years training before dancing en pointe. Many skeletal changes in a dancer's foot occur from use and should not be interpreted as injuries. Static forefoot deformities tend to appear in dancers at a younger age than the general population but seldom require corrective surgery. Dancers who perform classical ballet, modern, or ethnic dance, develop characteristics which constitute several conditions of the feet. 10. 11 They also have problems specific to the category of dance that they perform. These problems are related to the unusual stresses and positions which the discipline of the art requires in order to create the effect of characterizing movement. " In this article the authors present three categories of conditions in the forefoot some of which are "normal " and others of which are considered "disease " states. The skin of the foot is modified in the dancer through use as it comes in contact with the floor and with the constricting and restraining ballet pointe shoe, <b>ballet</b> <b>shoe,</b> and character shoe. A description of these changes is present. Superficial skin problems includ-ing characteristic corns and callouses over points of contact are shown. Disease states such as soft corns blisters, dissecting abscesses, and tears along the skin creases are presented. Conditions resulting from poor training are also presented...|$|E
