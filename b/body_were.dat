5|$|Keynes's {{personal}} interest in classical opera and dance led him to support the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden and the Ballet Company at Sadler's Wells. During the war, {{as a member of}} CEMA (Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts), Keynes helped secure government funds to maintain both companies while their venues were shut. Following the war, Keynes was instrumental in establishing the Arts Council of Great Britain and was its founding chairman in 1946. Unsurprisingly, from the start the two organisations that received the largest grants from the new <b>body</b> <b>were</b> the Royal Opera House and Sadler's Wells.|$|E

5|$|On June 30, 2003, the {{mutilated}} body of fourteen-year old schoolgirl Jodi Jones {{was discovered}} in woodland near her home in Easthouses, Scotland. The injuries sustained by Jones closely resembled those of actress Elizabeth Short, who was murdered in 1947 and was popularly referred to by media as the Black Dahlia. Jones' boyfriend, then-fifteen year old Luke Mitchell, was arrested on suspicion of her murder ten months later. During a search of his home, detectives confiscated a copy of The Golden Age of Grotesque containing the short film Doppelherz. It was purchased two days after Jones' death.

5|$|Upon {{completing}} training McKellar {{was deemed}} to have exceptional eyesight which {{earned him a}} reputation as a good marksman in air-to-air combat. Yet, paradoxically, when shooting with his rifle he was a well below average shot – a trait he shared with some other successful pilots. MacKellar was a keen sportsman. He believed physical fitness was a critical attribute in aerial combat; fitness, he believed, would ensure that the mind and <b>body</b> <b>were</b> always at their peak of alertness, and enable a pilot to react swiftly within a fluid battle situation.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the modern}} medical era, the main means for {{studying}} the internal structures of the <b>body</b> <b>were</b> dissection {{of the dead and}} inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living. It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction {{for studying the}} crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.|$|E

5|$|II./NJG1 {{saw little}} {{action in the}} first few months of 1943, and Schnaufer did not claim his next aerial victory until 14 May 1943. II./NJG1 Himmelbett control areas were located to catch the bombers heading for the Ruhr Area. Bomber Command had made only ten major attacks in that region from January to April 1943. Consequently, II./NJG1 claimed no {{victories}} in January, two in February, one in March and three in April. Schnaufer's number of aerial victories increased again during the Battle of the Ruhr. Schnaufer, with Baro as his radio operator, shot down a No. 214 Squadron Short Stirling R9242 at 02:14 on 14 May 1943 on an attack mission against Bochum. Four members of the crew, including pilot Sergeant R. M. Gibney, lost their lives. His next victory on the same mission at 03:07, his 9th overall, was a No. 98 Squadron Halifax JB873 returning from Bochum. The captain, Sergeant G. Dane and 2nd pilot Sergeant J. H. <b>Body</b> <b>were</b> killed in the crash. On the night of 29/30 May, Bomber Command attacked Wuppertal. Schnaufer and Baro took off on the first wave at 23:51 on 29 May and returned at 02:31 on the 30 May. They shot down two Stirlings, one at 00:48 and the other at 02:22, and one Halifax at 01:43.|$|E
5|$|In 1531, Renjun, {{a son of}} Rennyo, emerged victorious in the Kaga {{civil war}} and {{established}} a much tighter Hongan-ji hegemony over the province. The leaders of the opposition, including Togashi Taneyasu, where expelled from Kaga, though those who supported them were allowed to return. Without any central governing body, Kaga was consumed by political instability. The Asakura clan {{to the south and}} Uesugi to the north posed threats of invasion for Kaga, so the ji-samurai established a centralized authority at the Kanazawa Midō in Oyama Gobo. The Midō oversaw four district organizations of hatamoto – prominent local warlords. Each hatamoto commanded a group, kumi, of which there were roughly twenty in total. These kumi in turn ruled over regional groups of local warriors, priests, and the heads of village communes. The highest political organization of the ikki in Kaga was a committee of hatamoto, and the only permanent political <b>body</b> <b>were</b> the twenty kumi. Important matters would be settled at the meetings of the local hatamoto in consultation with the local Hongan-ji priests. However, these meetings were sporadic and held at the county, rather than provincial, level, and thus, according to Davis, would probably rarely have involved more than five hatamoto and one or two Hongan-ji priests. Kumi meetings were probably similar, with the exception that a hatamoto present at a kumi meeting would have held great respect.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March, Harclay was arraigned {{before a}} royal justice in Carlisle, but was denied a proper hearing. He was brought forward apparelled in his robes of estate as a knight and earl.

He was then convicted as a traitor, and condemned to be hanged, drawn and quartered. He behaved with dignity at his execution, where he maintained that he had acted as he did {{out of concern for}} {{the best interest of the}} country. After his death, his head was taken to the king at Knaresborough in Yorkshire, before it was hung up on London Bridge.

5|$|The 1845 {{legislature}} met {{three different}} times, under two different structures. First, from June 24 to July 5, 1845, the legislature met in Oregon City, {{first at the}} home of John E. Long and then the home of Theophilus R. Magruder, with Morton M. McCarver serving as the speaker of the group. After this, the Organic Laws were replaced with the Organic Act of 1845, which altered the legislature in several ways. First the number of representatives was increased to include a minimum of 13 and a maximum of 61. Second, the name was changed to the House of Representatives. All members of the <b>body</b> <b>were</b> to be elected by popular vote with vacancies filled using special elections. The body also received new powers to impeach any civil official by a 3/4ths vote, apportion the legislators among the districts, create post offices, levy taxes, declare war, organize and call out the militia, create lower courts, pass laws concerning the general welfare of the region, regulate trade with the Native Americans, regulate liquor sale and manufacture, and regulate the police power of the government, among other powers. Meetings continued to be in June and December.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Dales, an {{assistant}} constable, arrived from Birmingham, {{where he was}} one of those responsible for policing the town. On ascertaining the situation he interrogated Thornton, and soon arrested him. However, Dales did not keep any notes and later proved unable to remember much of what the prisoner told him. Thornton was then examined by the local magistrate, William Bedford, who ordered Thornton searched. The search revealed that Thornton was wearing underclothing with bloodstains, and Thornton admitted having sexual intercourse with Ashford the previous night. The prisoner's shoes were removed, and comparisons with the footprints in the field were made by the factory workers, who later testified at trial that they matched. A post-mortem examination revealed that Ashford died from drowning, and that the only marks on her <b>body</b> <b>were</b> two lacerations in the genital area. The examination concluded that until the sexual act which caused the bleeding, Ashford was a virgin. She was menstruating at the time of her death.|$|E
5|$|When {{an object}} is in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium, a global layer of liquid covering its surface would form a liquid {{surface of the}} same shape as the body, apart from small-scale surface features such as craters and fissures. If the body does not rotate, {{it will be a}} sphere, but the faster it rotates, the more oblate or even scalene it becomes. If such a rotating <b>body</b> <b>were</b> to be heated until it melted, its overall shape would not change when liquid. The extreme example of a non-spherical body in hydrostatic equilibrium is , which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles. If the body has a massive nearby companion, then tidal forces come into effect as well, distorting it into a prolate spheroid. An example of this is Jupiter's moon Io, which is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System due to effects of tidal heating. Tidal forces also cause a body's rotation to gradually become tidally locked, such that it always presents the same face to its companion. An extreme example of this is the Pluto–Charon system, where both bodies are tidally locked to each other. Earth's Moon is also tidally locked, as are many satellites of the gas giants.|$|E
