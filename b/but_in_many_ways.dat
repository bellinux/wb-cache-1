500|$|Diane McWhorter, Pulitzer Prize-winning {{historian}} of the Birmingham civil rights campaign, asserts that To Kill a Mockingbird condemns racism instead of racists, and states that every child in the South has moments of racial cognitive dissonance when they {{are faced with the}} harsh reality of inequality. This feeling causes them to question the beliefs with which they have been raised, which for many children is what the novel does. McWhorter writes of Lee, [...] "for a white person from the South to write a book like this in the late 1950s is really unusual—by its very existence an act of protest." [...] Author James McBride calls Lee brilliant but stops short of calling her brave: [...] "I think by calling Harper Lee brave you kind of absolve yourself of your own racism... She certainly set the standards in terms of how these issues need to be discussed, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> I feel... the moral bar's been lowered. And that's really distressing. We need a thousand Atticus Finches." [...] McBride, however, defends the book's sentimentality, and the way Lee approaches the story with [...] "honesty and integrity".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics. Travis Fickett from IGN retroactively gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10, signifying a [...] "good" [...] episode. Fickett commented that [...] "Basketball" [...] was stylistically different {{from most of}} the other episodes in the fledgling series, pointing to its lack of a sub-plot and its characterization of Michael Scott. Fickett, when discussing the latter, singled out the moment wherein Michael hurts Phyllis' feelings by telling her she can't play basketball, writing, [...] "The moment is played mostly straight–and it does feel more realistic and uncomfortable and in that way, the show leans more towards the feel of the UK series. It's a great moment, but feels like a different show." [...] Overall, he wrote that, [...] "There is still quite a bit of funny stuff , <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways,</b> this episode suggests what the show would have been like had it taken a slightly different direction in terms of tone and style." [...] Miss Alli from Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A–". Jenna Mullins from E! News referred to [...] "Basketball" [...] as her [...] "all-time favorite episode of The Office" [...] in an article about Steve Carell's last episode of the series.|$|E

500|$|The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) report 2005 defines {{ecosystem}} services as benefits people obtain from ecosystems, and distinguishes four categories, namely provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. A fundamental tenet {{is that a}} few species of arthropod are well understood for their influence on humans (such as honeybees, ants, mosquitoes, and spiders). [...] However, insects offer ecological goods and services. The Xerces Society calculates {{the economic impact of}} four ecological services rendered by insects: pollination, recreation (i.e. [...] "the importance of bugs to hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation, including bird-watching"), dung burial, and pest control. The value has been estimated at $153 billion worldwide. As the ant expert E. O. Wilson observed: [...] "If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos." [...] A Nova (TV Series) segment on the American Public Broadcasting Service framed the relationship with insects in an urban context: [...] "We humans like to think that we run the world. But even in the heart of our great cities, a rival superpower thrives... These tiny creatures live all around us in vast numbers, though we hardly even notice them. <b>But</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways,</b> it is they who really run the show. The Washington Post stated: [...] "We are flying blind in many aspects of preserving the environment, and that's why we are so surprised when a species like the honeybee starts to crash, or an insect we don't want, the Asian tiger mosquito or the fire ant, appears in our midst. In other words: Start thinking about the bugs." ...|$|E
500|$|More modern {{reception}} for Vampyr {{has been more}} positive. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 100% of critics have given the film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 30, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Full of disorienting visual effects, Carl Theodor Dreyer's Vampyr is as theoretically unsettling as it is conceptually disturbing." [...] Todd Kristel of the online film database AllMovie gave the film {{four and a half}} stars out of five, stating that [...] "Vampyr isn't the easiest classic film to enjoy, even if you are a fan of 1930s horror movies...If you're patient with the slow pacing and ambiguous story line of Vampyr, you'll find that this film offers many striking images" [...] and that although the film is [...] "not exciting in terms of pacing, it's a good choice {{if you want to see}} a film that establishes a compelling mood". Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "The greatness of Carl Dreyer's [...] derives partly from its handling of the vampire theme in terms of sexuality and eroticism and partly from its highly distinctive, dreamy look, but it also has something to do with Dreyer's radical recasting of narrative form". J. Hoberman of the Village Voice wrote that [...] "Vampyr is Dreyer's most radical film—maybe one of my dozen favorite movies by any director". Anton Bitel of Channel 4 awarded the film four and a half stars out of five, comparing it to the silent vampire film Nosferatu, stating that it is [...] "lesser known (<b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> superior)" [...] and that the film is [...] "a triumph of the irrational, Dreyer's eerie memento mori never allows either protagonist or viewer fully to wake up from its surreal nightmare".|$|E

2500|$|Designed and {{produced}} in the post-World War II [...] era, the Bellanca 14-13 Cruisair Senior was aimed at a general aviation market. Pilot/owners were offered a combination of performance, low engine power and a modest price. Its performance and structural strength also made it attractive for utility work, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> the Bellanca design was an anachronism, relying on a conventional landing gear configuration and wood-and-fabric construction that harkened back to an earlier age. Postwar economics along with a glut of surplus military aircraft precluded heavy sales although about 600 were produced.|$|E

[...] Whatever the decisions were at Judson, they obviously worked. [...] From the day Pearl acquired them, until they were sold off to members of the Atkinson's Candy family in 1983, Judson remained a profitable business. [...] When the Atkinsons bought Judson, the only real evidence of ownership by a larger company, and one in a completely different industry, was the office furniture and supplies. [...] Everything in the Judson offices were labeled with [...] "Property of the Pearl Brewing Company" [...] and items such as pencils, pens, ashtrays, notepads, and even first aid kits were branded with the Pearl logos.|$|E

As the clerk knew that the merchant would have been very angry at the insult he had offered to Leigh, he had not ventured to make a complaint; <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> {{he had been able to}} cause numberless petty annoyances.

60|$|The list of {{the really}} serious, the really convinced, the really {{important}} and comprehensible people now alive includes, as most Englishmen would now be prepared to admit, the German Emperor. He is a practical man and a poet. I {{do not know whether}} there are still people in existence who think there is some kind of faint antithesis between these two characters; but I incline to think there must be, because of the surprise which the career of the German Emperor has generally evoked. When he came to the throne it became at once apparent that he was poetical; people assumed in consequence that he was unpractical; that he would plunge Europe into war, that he would try to annex France, that he would say he was the Emperor of Russia, that he would stand on his head in the Reichstag, that he would become a pirate on the Spanish Main. Years upon years have passed; he has gone on making speeches, he has gone on talking about God and his sword, he has poured out an ever increased rhetoric and æstheticism. And yet all the time people have slowly and surely realised that he knows what he is about, that {{he is one of the}} best friends of peace, that his influence on Europe is not only successful, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> good, that he knows what world he is living in better than a score of materialists.|$|E
