50|$|A {{new company}} {{was formed in}} 1912 and the mine reopened after many years. A Victorian mine manager, David Morgan, was {{appointed}} as the new Tyrconnel mine manager. By early 1913 they had the winding gear and ore bins erected. The owners bought the Great Dyke Company's ten head battery at Caledonia Creek near Thornborough. T. Harley, engineer-in-charge, had the contract for £80 to transport the battery to its new position. Their first twelve weeks of crushings from the mine were impressive yielding 1,041 ounces of gold from 945 tons of stone (sent out to another battery for crushing). They installed a compressor in July 1913 and rock drills in September. In October they struck a reef almost 2.4 m wide which offered two to three ounce gold quartz. The mine shaft was then put in order in November for skips. By then the battery was almost ready and the headframe was being put in position. They also had a suction gas engine sitting at Dimbulah awaiting transport to the Hodgkinson. The battery started crushing in February 1914 but broke down in May because the engine <b>bed</b> <b>plate</b> broke. The company was doing very well through Morgan's careful management and William Keating's confidence. They were obtaining one ounce stone continually in 1914 and the battery kept going {{as long as there}} was water.|$|E

About 10 million visitors attended, equivalent to about 20% {{of the population of the}} United States at the time. Hundreds of machines and devices were exhibited, including a special exhibit of windmills, among which were three models by Eclipse as well as by the United States Wind-Engine & Pump Company (Batavia, Illinois), E. Stover & Brothers (Freeport, Illinois) and Gammon & Deering (Chicago, Illinois). The Eclipse windmill received the following citation:Commended as a thoroughly efficient, well-made engine, economical in work. We find a strong solid wheel varying in size from ten feet to sixteen feet diameter. The special claim is for a small controllable side vane, which acts as an overbalance and draws the sail away from the wind in a storm. It is prevented from acting unfavorably in a light wind, because it must first overcome the leverage of a weighted arm, which can be made adjustable by moving the weight nearer or farther from the centre.

5000|$|The King {{granted the}} town {{the right to}} bear arms when the Ottoman army was {{frightening}} the surroundings. The Transylvanian Saxons chose to build instead of fortresses around the towns, to fortify the churches. The church has three rows of exterior fortifications linked by gate towers, nine in total. The first, with four towers, dates to the 14th century; the second was built together with the church, and has a series of reinforcing arches; the third, also with towers, is from the 16th and 17th centuries. The clock tower to the north of the church also serves as a gate within the inner fortifications. Four stories high, it has a wooden battlement and parapets. The clock is above the pyramid-shaped roof. The wooden bell tower is located north of the church, while the mausoleum tower contains the headstones of the priest who built the church as well as the bishops buried at Biertan. The Catholic tower was used by the few Saxons who did not adhere to the Reformation but kept their Roman Catholic faith. Its chapel (ca. 1520 - 1530) features a rare example of 16th-century Transylvanian mural painting, forming an exception to the austere aesthetic that predominated. The grounds contain a [...] "matrimonial prison" [...] where couples wishing to divorce were confined so they could be sure they wished to end their marriage.

5000|$|Another {{significant}} {{advantage of}} IQF technology {{is its ability}} to separate the products during the freezing process, which results in products of higher quality when compared to those which are block frozen for example. This advantage is also important for food sustainability as it allows the defrost and use of the exact needed quantity as opposed to defrosting a bigger block and dispose of the unneeded or unused portion. There is a range of IQF technologies, but the main concept is to transport the product into the freezer {{with the help of a}} processing line belt or infeed shaker. Inside the freezer the product travels through the freezing zone and comes out on the other side. The transportation of the product inside the freezer can be achieved through different technologies depending on the IQF freezer’s brand. There are solutions based on transportation belts inside the freezer which is similar to a conveyor belt. Other latest innovations include <b>bed</b> <b>plates</b> on which the product lands and an asymmetrical movement is used for making the product advance by itself in the freezer.|$|R

Five sets of <b>bed</b> <b>plates</b> ranging in roughness from roughened PVC to 20 mm gravel were used to generate turbulence in the flume. Velocity measurements were made using a constant temperature anemometer with a conical hot-film probe. The ability to rotate the flume walls at any given rate enabled the researchers to perform experiments where the average velocity was kept virtually constant, while the turbulence intensity increased with increasing bed roughness. Measurements of water and air temperature as well as digital images taken during ice formation were analyzed. It was found that although turbulence intensity seemed to have an effect on several of the key features of a supercooling curve, the relationships were not particularly strong. The most significant finding is the mean diameter and standard deviation of the frazil disks seem to reach nearly constant values after several minutes of supercooling, and that these values were strongly affected by turbulence intensity. In addition, it is hypothesized that a power-law relationship could describe the variation of the mean diameter and standard deviation with time...|$|R

40|$|The {{processes}} of secondary nucleation and flocculation of frazil ice are relatively poorly understood. In {{order to better}} understand the effect that turbulence intensity has on these processes, a series of experiments were undertaken at the Hydraulics Research & Testing Facility in the University of Manitoba using a counter-rotating flume. Five sets of <b>bed</b> <b>plates</b> ranging in roughness from smooth PVC to 20 mm gravel were used to generate the turbulence in the flume. Velocity measurements in open water were made using a constant temperature anemometer with a conical hot-film probe. The ability to rotate the flume walls at any given rate enabled the researchers to perform experiments where the average velocity was kept constant, while the turbulence intensity increased with increasing bed roughness. Measurements of water temperature, air temperature, and digital images taken during ice formation were analyzed. It was found that the rate of secondary nucleation increased with increasing turbulence intensity, however, the trend was not well defined. A multiple linear regression model using turbulence intensity in addition to the maximum degree of supercooling as the two independent variables was found to reasonably model the rate of secondary nucleation. Initial results demonstrate that turbulence intensity increases the uniformity of the vertical distribution of frazil particles and tends to inhibit frazil flocculation. 1...|$|R

This thesis present a mechanical design and dimensioning of a transition piece between the yaw bearing (part of the nacelle) and the tower in this reference turbine. A fatigue analysis to verify the lifetime of 20 years for the main shaft, <b>bed</b> <b>plate</b> and transition piece has also been performed. The final design has shape like a cone, which distributes the loads from the yaw bearing to the whole section of each tower leg.

The material EN-GJS- 400 - 18 is suggested for the transition piece, <b>bed</b> <b>plate</b> and main shaft. It has a yield strength of 240 MPa and a tensile strength of 370 MPa. The mass of the transition piece is 49. 6 tonnes and a peak stress of 262 MPa in a single node was found. This is further discussed in chapter 12. 3 and 18. The fatigue analysis was calculated with a detailed assessment described in the European standard, EN 13445 - 6 together with IEC 61400.

40|$|The dynamic energy {{dissipation}} within a jigging cycle has been mechanically analyzed using data {{developed in a}} highly instrumented and controlled pilot scale Baum jig. The analysis {{is based on the}} use of the energy and momentum equations for the fluid. It was found that energy balances on the water in the jig failed to close because of elastic deformation of the jig body, rather than inaccuracies in the measurement techniques or failure to account for heat transfer. This deformation problem appears to be common in either pilot jigs or commercial jigs. An empirical means of correcting the energy balance was devised and applied to the data with some success. Using this compensation method, the energy balance was improved. The likely energy balance indicates that (i) less than 7 % of the energy of the incoming compressed air is expended in the jig system, (ii) less than 5 % of the energy from the compressed air is actually dissipated in the jig bed, (iii) the kinetic energy input from the hutch water supply is effectively negligible, in comparison to the energy input from the compressed air, and (iv) about 2. 5 - 3. 7 % of the energy from compressed air is dissipated around the <b>bed</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|E
