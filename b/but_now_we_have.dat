500|$|After {{the match}} Henrik Larsson {{said in an}} {{interview}} that he was disappointed to have scored two goals in the final and still come away with a runners up medal. Larsson stated that there was nothing to be happy about the outcome of the final. He told BBC Sport, [...] "I've said before, I'd much rather not score and be able to lift the UEFA Cup, than to score twice and finish up on the losing side. There's nothing to be happy about, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to find a way to lift ourselves for the league game on Sunday." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{reported}} that Madhur Bhandarkar had been approached to direct the film, but later turned down the offer because of other working commitments. It was confirmed in November 2011 that Vishal Mahadkar, director of Blood Money, was to direct the picture, but the following month {{it was announced that}} Mohit Suri had replaced Mahadkar as director at the last minute. Bhatt confirmed the development, saying [...] "Earlier we had finalised Vishal for the project. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> scrapped that idea and found a fresh one. We got Mohit to direct the film". Several media outlets falsely reported that the film is a remake of the Vishesh films 1990 love triangle Awaargi. However, Mahesh Bhatt denied the rumours and said [...] "Aashiqui 2 is not a remake of any of our films. It's an original script. A very contemporary love story dealing with mature emotions." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an issue}} of Catalyst, the Catholic League responded to Rosenberg's article. They argued that Rosenberg was biased against Catholics, in that he was content with the series lampooning Catholicism, but not other religions. They wrote, [...] "all along {{we have been told}} by Fox that none of our {{complaints}} were valid because none of the material was truly offensive. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a Fox executive producer disingenuously giving away his hand by protesting why it should be okay to offend another group of people with the same material he initially said wasn't offensive to Catholics! And isn't it striking that Rosenberg is upset {{with the fact that the}} double standard—which now, for the first time works positively for Catholics—is a real problem. Never do we remember Rosenberg protesting the double standard that allows 'artists' to dump on Catholics while protecting most other segments of society from their assaults." [...] The League also complimented the members' participation, writing, [...] "It only goes to prove what can be done when Catholics get actively involved." ...|$|E

60|$|Then {{he spoke}} in an excited and venomous fashion. He pointed out that <b>we</b> Gentiles <b>had</b> brought all this trouble upon Mur, since before we came the Abati, {{although}} threatened, had lived in peace and glory--he actually used the word glory!--for generations. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> stung the Fung, as a hornet stings a bull, and made them mad, so that they wished to toss the Abati. He proposed, therefore, that we should at once be ejected from Mur.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Rothbard wrote that [...] "One gratifying {{aspect of our}} rise to some {{prominence}} is that, {{for the first time}} in my memory, <b>we,</b> 'our side,' <b>had</b> captured a crucial word from the enemy... 'Libertarians'... had long been simply a polite word for left-wing anarchists, that is for anti-private property anarchists, either of the communist or syndicalist variety. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> taken it over..." [...] Since the resurgence of neoliberalism in the 1970s, this modern American libertarianism has spread beyond North America via think tanks and political parties.|$|R
500|$|The club's poor run of form {{continued}} in their next home match against Watford, as they suffered their fifth straight defeat and slipped {{to the bottom}} of the league table. Another 3–1 defeat, against Newcastle United, was followed by a second successive 1–0 home defeat against Nottingham Forest, to leave Argyle with just two points from their first seven matches. Paul Sturrock kept faith with the young defensive pairing of James Chester and Shane Lowry for their next game against Peterborough United, and two second-half goals Mackie and Rory Fallon secured Argyle's first three points of the new season. [...] "It's nice to get three points, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to build on it," [...] said Sturrock. [...] "There's no point in us getting this result and then kicking ourselves in the teeth again." [...] Argyle earned their first home win of the season four days later against Scunthorpe United. A penalty from Judge gave the hosts a 2–1 win after Fallon's opening goal was cancelled out by Scunthorpe striker Gary Hooper. Their upturn in results was halted by Blackpool, who won 2–0 at Bloomfield Road. The hosts opening goal was scored by Marcel Seip, a player on loan from Argyle. He took part in the match following a request from former manager Ian Holloway, a decision which was criticised by supporters but defended by senior Argyle officials. [...] "I suppose it was bound to happen that Marcel would score the goal, but I don't think we should look on it as anything other than probably the cover should have been better," [...] said executive director Keith Todd. [...] "We understood exactly what we are doing." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Wiener, the [...] "progress" [...] {{of human}} society as we {{conceive}} it today {{did not exist}} until four hundred years ago, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> entered [...] "a special period {{in the history of}} the world" [...] (p.46). The progress of recent centuries has changed our world so dramatically that humans are being forced to adapt to the new environmental order or disorder that we are still creating. Wiener believes the quickness and range of our adaptability has always been the strong point of the human species, which distinguishes us from even the most intelligent of other living creatures. Our advancements in technology have created new opportunities along with new restrictions.|$|E

[...] She also said she was [...] "terrified" [...] of acting out the birth, saying she would prefer to give birth in real life. She said that filming the pre-recorded labour scenes meant she [...] "was knackered after screaming and crying and pretending to push all day." [...] In an interview with Digital Spy, she said that she was [...] "really, really nervous" [...] and that the prospect of acting the birth was [...] "very scary", but added, [...] "I really appreciate that they've given me the opportunity, especially considering that I haven't been here at EastEnders for that long. It's really nice that they've trusted me with it, so hopefully I'll do it justice! It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it'll go well." [...] To help prepare, she asked several women for advice, including her mother, and was told [...] "It's the worst pain you can ever imagine!" [...] She found it [...] "quite difficult" [...] to imagine what it would be like to act out as she has no children, but had watched Channel 4 show One Born Every Minute to help, as she did not want to [...] "overdo the scene or make it look really fake." ...|$|E

60|$|The next morning, {{we talked}} over the Indian question, {{and then went}} down to the fort. We hadn't been there for three or four days, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> decided not to stand nagging by a couple of red-skinned savages, but to go and see the captain and tell him all about it. All except the proclamation--Rectus wouldn't agree to have that brought in at all. Mr. Cholott had {{introduced}} us to the captain, and he was a first-rate fellow, and when we told him how <b>we</b> <b>had</b> stormed his old fort, he laughed and said he wondered we didn't break our necks, and that the next time we did it he'd put us in the guard-house, sure.|$|R
