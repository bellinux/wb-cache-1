40|$|Growing {{numbers of}} {{morbidity}} and mortality due to the cancer and coronary heart disease is recognized as the increasing challenge in the world. The initial stage of these diseases, early diagnosis and treatment are the main objectives of current researches. According to Lithuanian Health Information Centre {{morbidity and mortality}} due to these diseases in Lithuania exceed average of European Union. The oxidative stress occurs in cells as a result of normal physiological processes and environmental interactions, and the complex antioxidant defense system are of particular importance in protecting biological systems against oxidative damage by free radicals. Recently polyphenols and anthocyanins containing foods and preparations have attracted attention due to their health promoting benefits. Anthocyanins make one of the main groups of flavonoids, and represent polyphenolic compounds, that are found in vegetables and fruits, particularly in berries. An important effect of anthocyanins is the scavenging of oxygen-derived free radicals. They can interfere with few different free radical-producing systems, and can increase the function of the endogenous antioxidants. The aim of the research is to choose sources for the products with antioxidant activity from plants cultivated in Lithuania, evaluate quality and antioxidant activity of <b>black</b> <b>currant,</b> red currant and chokeberry products, to develop and evaluate technologies of phytopharmaceuticals with antioxidant activity. Innovation and practical significance of the research. Antioxidant activity of Lithuanian <b>black</b> <b>currant,</b> red currant and chokeberry berries concentrated juices was evaluated for the first time. There were applied DPPH and ABTS methods for these products. These results will bring antioxidant activity data performed by world scientists up-to-date. Dry product from Lithuanian <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> berries juices was made by spry draying. Production of tablets with <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> polyphenols (and athocyanins) was made {{for the first time in}} Lithuania. Two products with antioxidant activity were prepared for industry: tablets with standardized extract of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> and complex composition tablets with standardized extract of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> and vitamin premix (vitamins E, C and β-carotene). Experimental series of tablets was produced, quality and stability was evaluated. Composition of tablet was optimized by experimental design. Scientific technological documentation for tablets with standardized extract of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> and complex composition tablets with standardized extract of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> and vitamin premix was prepared. Results The stability of polyphenols and anthocyanins is significantly influenced by storage conditions of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> and chokeberry concentrated juices. It is recommended to store <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> and chokeberry concentrated juices at low temperatures and the time should be possibly short till it is processed to more stable products. The results demonstrated insufficient stability of juice concentrates, and impossibility of application of long lasting drying processes in <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> and chokeberry berries dry products manufacturing. Fast and efficient drying methods for liquid products should be applied to preserve qualitative and quantitative composition and their antioxidant activity. Only complex approach to quality evaluation of natural origin products presents reliable basis for establishment of product value. Determined contents of polyphenols and anthocyanins in <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> product were higher and it possessed stronger antioxidant activity if compared to chokeberry. Therefore <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> concentrated juice was chosen for further processing and development of solid dosage form possessing antioxidant activity. Spray drying procedure was performed in Medical University of Gdansk, department of Pharmaceutical technology (Poland). Spry drier „ANHYDRO“ type LAB – S 1 (Denmark) was used for this procedure. <b>Black</b> <b>currant</b> juice concentrate was diluted with water (1 : 1) and 10 % of amorphous silica was admixed to the water-diluted concentrate. The resulting powder was dry and non-sticky. Other used product was <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> extract standardized 7 % anthocyanins. Conclusions Researches were performed at 2001 - 2005. During this period there were analyzed and evaluated <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> (Ribes nigrum L.), chokeberry (Chokeberry melanocarpa (Michx.) Elliott) and red currant (Ribes rubrum L.) berries concentrated juices as raw material for production of preparations with antioxidant activity. There were produced tablets with spry dried <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> berries juices; tablets with <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> extract standardized 7 % anthocyanins; and tablets with standardized (7 % anthocyanins) <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> extract and vitamin (E, C, β-carotene) mixture. Quality and stability of these tablets were evaluated. It can be concluded: 1. <b>Black</b> <b>currant</b> extract was chosen for production of antioxidant preparations. Results showed higher amount of polyphenols 3786, 25 ± 180 mg/l GAE (p= 0, 0193) and antioxidant activity 78, 49 ± 3, 9 % (p= 0, 0003) of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> juices then in chokeberry juices. Results showed low antioxidant activity, small amounts polyphenols and anthocyanins of red currant juices. Therefore red currant analysis was not continued. 2. Chromatographic and spectroscopic methods were applied for qualitative and quantitative analysis; Acceptability of these methods was validated for analysis of raw material and stability of tablets. 3. Polyphenols, anthocyanins and antioxidant activity significantly decreased after storage at 20 ± 0, 5 and 40 ± 0, 5 ºC temperatures. Best stability was determinated at 2 ± 0, 5 ºC temperature (p< 0, 001). It is recommended to store <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> and chokeberry concentrated juices at low temperatures and the time should be possibly short till it is processed to more stable products. 4. Dependence of antioxidant activity on anthocyanin amount was determinated (r= 0, 76). Anthocyanins in <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> juices were more stabile (p= 0, 0062) then in chokeberry juices. 5. Spray drying was applied for <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> juices, conditions of drying were determinated. Spry dried product is appropriate for production of solid dosage forms due to good technological properties. 6. Tablets with dry concentrate of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> juices were produced, appropriate excipients were chosen for good quality tablet production by direct pressing. Analysis confirmed quality and stability of tablets with dry concentrate of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> juices. 7. Two technologies of tablets with standardized <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> extract, standardized <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> extract and vitamin mixture (vitamins E, C and β-carotene) were studied as potential antioxidant phytopharmaceuticals. Tablets technology of these two compositions was established, quality and stability were evaluated. Tablet composition with standardized <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> extract was optimized by orthogonal full factorial design model. Optimal mounts of excipients were determinated: 18, 0 mg of silica, colloidal anhydrous, 3, 5 mg of magnesium stearate and 278, 5 mg of microcrystalline cellulose. Results satisfied Europe pharmacopeias requirements for tablet quality. 8.

40|$|The {{blackcurrant}} <b>gall</b> <b>mite</b> (Cecidophyopsis ribis) is {{the most}} important pest of blackcurrant crops. Over recent years withdrawal from plant protection programmes of chemical products (endosulfan and amitraz) used for the control of this pest in Poland, has led to an observed increase in population numbers. In 2013, fenpiroxymate (Ortus 05 SC) became registered for control of this pest. It is deemed best that chemical protection should be used during the migration period; when big <b>gall</b> <b>mites</b> emerge from buds in search of new buds. The studies were carried out in a plantation of blackcurrants during 2011 - 2013. The assessment of migration of the blackcurrant <b>gall</b> <b>mite</b> was carried out on the cultivars ‘Ben Hope’, ‘Ben Alde’r, ‘Ojeby’n and ‘Ruben’. Every year, from selected cultivars buds were collected. They were then placed on blackcurrant leaves within Petri dishes. After one, three and five days of placing buds on the leaves, the estimated number of eriophyid mites on the leaves was calculated. The data has shown a very useful method for monitoring blackcurrant <b>gall</b> <b>mite,</b> which can be used in calculating the treatment dates for this pest. Also, the data has shown that differences in the periods of migration of the mite are dependent on the cultivar and time of flowering.

40|$|There was no {{investigations}} on {{distribution and}} identification of nepoviruses in various <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> cultivars in Lithuania. The {{aim of the}} article is to investigate distribution of nepoviruses in a <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> collection and its variation among different cultivars and different plant parts. The following 13 species of Eucariosma section of Ribes genus where chosen as a research subject: Vakariai, Almiai, Joniniai, Minaj Šmyriov, Pilėnai, Laimiai, Svyriai, Ben Tiran, Jošta, Nr. 1, Nr. 2, Nr. 3, 93 - 149 - 02 - 1. The following sap transmitted nepoviruses were also investigated: Arabis mosaic nepovirus (ArMV), Strawberry ringspot nepovirus (SLRV) and Raspberry ringspot nepovirus (RRV). The infection ratio of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> with nepoviruses was investigated using ELISA (Ensyme-linked Immunosorbent assay) method. Research was conducted in 2003 and 2004. In 2003 thirteen cultivars were investigated for AMV and SLRV. In 2004 the distribution of above mentioned and additional nepovirus RRV in 13 cultivars were investigated. The results of investigation of nepoviruses demonstrated that the AMV is most common {{in the collection of}} <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> species. 9 of 13 cultivars were characterized as contaminated with the virus. The distribution of other two viruses: (SLRV and RRV) was less diagnosed. They were identified in 4 and 5 species respectively. A highest infection ratio of examined viruses within plants of distinct <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> species was found in buds and leaves. There were no viruses found in flowers and barks. That indicates that the buds and leaves are the most suitable plant parts for identification of examined nepoviruses. Virus symptoms and their intensity vary through seasons.
