5|$|In the 970s, Haakon Sigurdsson, Jarl of Lade, {{became the}} most {{powerful}} man in Norway, at first supported by Harald <b>Bluetooth</b> of Denmark and paying tribute to him—though the two later fell out over religious matters. Harald had converted to Christianity and was eager to Christianise Norway, while Haakon remained a staunch pagan. In 995 Haakon was deposed and the young Christian leader Olaf Tryggvason came to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Internet Connection Sharing, {{supported}} on compatible devices, allows {{the phone to}} share its Internet connection with computers via USB and <b>Bluetooth.</b> Windows Mobile supports virtual private networking over PPTP protocol.

This allows OEMs to integrate a variety of modems into their equipment.|$|E
5|$|Jelling, in Denmark, is {{the largest}} royal {{memorial}} from the Viking Age and it was made by Harald <b>Bluetooth</b> in memory of his parents Gorm and Tyra, and in honour of himself. It {{was only one of}} the two large tumuli that contained a chamber tomb, but both barrows, the church and the two Jelling stones testify to how important it was to mark death ritually during the pagan era and the earliest Christian times.|$|E

5|$|According to Adam of Bremen and the Saxo Grammaticus, Roskilde {{was founded}} in the 980s by Harald <b>Bluetooth.</b> On high ground above the harbour, he built a wooden church consecrated to the Holy Trinity {{as well as a}} royal {{residence}} nearby. Although no traces of these buildings have been discovered, in 1997 archaeologists found the remains of Viking ships in the Isefjord, the oldest of which is dated to 1030. At the time, there were also two churches in the area: St Jørgensbjerg, an early stone church, and a wooden church discovered under today's St Ib's Church. Harald was buried in the wooden church he had built on the site of today's Roskilde Cathedral.|$|E

Displays were supported by one or (optionally) more PCIe graphics cards. More recent cards featured two Mini DisplayPort connectors and one dual-link Digital Visual Interface (DVI) port, with various configurations of on-card graphics memory available.|$|E
5|$|Nonnebakken, a {{hill in the}} Odense area, is {{the site}} of one of Denmark's six former Viking ring castles, built during the reign of Sweyn Forkbeard, who had forced his father Harold <b>Bluetooth</b> to leave the country and seek refuge by the Jomsvikings in Wollin (modern Poland) in around 975. The fort {{provided}} its occupier the command of the Odense River passing next to the hill. The archaeological remains of the fort were heavily damaged when a building for the Odd Fellow lodge was constructed on the site during the late nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Chevrolet Volt comes {{standard}} with cruise control; remote vehicle start-up system; 17-inch 5-spoke forged painted aluminum wheels; <b>Bluetooth</b> {{wireless technology}} for select phones; audio and navigation {{system with a}} center console capacitive touch panel and DVD and MP3 playback, with voice recognition; OnStar with five years of service; BOSE premium speaker system, with six speakers and sub-woofer; 30 GB hard drive for audio data storage; USB port; three auxiliary, 12-volt, power outlets; power door locks and windows; power adjustable mirrors; programmable time of day charge control; and a 110-volt charge cord.|$|E
5|$|The DualShock series {{consists}} of four controllers: the DualShock which was the fourth controller released for the PlayStation; the DualShock 2, the only standard controller released for the PlayStation 2, and the DualShock 3, the second and current controller released for the PlayStation 3, and the DualShock 4, which went through a massive redesign and is the default input of the PlayStation 4, and upon release was compatible with the PS3 originally only via USB and eventually with a firmware update, <b>Bluetooth</b> connectivity was enabled. The Sixaxis was the first official controller for the PlayStation 3, {{and is based on}} the same design as the DualShock series (but lacking the vibration motors of the DualShock series of controllers).|$|E
5|$|The {{centre of}} Aarhus {{was once a}} pagan burial site until Aarhus' first church, Holy Trinity Church, a timber structure, was built upon it {{during the reign of}} Frode, King of Jutland, around 900. In the 900s an earth rampart for the defence of the early city was constructed, {{encircling}} the settlement, much like the defence structures found at Viking ring fortresses elsewhere. The rampart was later reinforced by Harald <b>Bluetooth,</b> and together with the town's geographical placement, this suggests that Aros was an important trade and military centre. There are strong indications of a former royal residence from the Viking Age in Viby, a few kilometres south of the Aarhus city centre.|$|E

5|$|In January 2014, Elite Systems, who {{produced}} a successful range of {{software for the}} original ZX Spectrum in the 1980s, announced plans for a Spectrum-themed <b>bluetooth</b> keyboard that would attach to mobile devices such as the iPad. The company provided a crowdfunding campaign in order to fund the project, which would be compatible with games already released on iTunes and Google Play. Elite Systems took down its Spectrum Collection application the following month, due to complaints from authors of the original 1980s game software {{that they had not}} been paid for the content. Later that year, a £100 Sinclair ZX Spectrum Vega retro video game console was announced by Retro Computers and crowdfunded on IndieGogo, with the apparent backing of Clive Sinclair as an investor, but without a full keyboard and manufactured in a limited capacity.|$|E
5|$|There was initial {{confusion}} as to {{how this}} game would be distributed to consumers, after the announcement {{that it would be}} a multiplayer-only title. Sony announced on May 16, 2007, that there would be two iterations of the game. The game alone is downloadable from the PlayStation Store for US$29.99 (£19.99, €29.99), with an initial download size of 798MB. This version is restricted to the PlayStation Network account that buys it. The second is a retail Blu-ray Disc version that sells for $59.99 (the standard retail price of most PlayStation 3 games upon release), bundled with a Jabra BT125 <b>Bluetooth</b> headset in America and the Jabra BT135 in Europe, allowing players to chat with other players online while playing the game. An additional third was later released on October 10, 2007 without the inclusion of a USB headset, which was priced at US$39.99. Both retail versions feature extra content such as behind-the-scenes developer interviews, concept art and trailers. Warhawk was re-released as a Greatest Hits title on July 28, 2008 for $29.99.|$|E
5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, <b>Bluetooth,</b> optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E
