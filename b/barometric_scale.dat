5000|$|The SI unit of {{pressure}} is the pascal (symbol Pa), but vacuum is often measured in torrs, named for Torricelli, an early Italian physicist (1608-1647). A torr {{is equal to}} the displacement of a millimeter of mercury (mmHg) in a manometer with 1 torr equaling 133.3223684 pascals above absolute zero pressure. Vacuum is often also measured on the <b>barometric</b> <b>scale</b> or as a percentage of atmospheric pressure in bars or atmospheres. Low vacuum is often measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or pascals (Pa) below standard atmospheric pressure. [...] "Below atmospheric" [...] means that the absolute pressure {{is equal to the}} current atmospheric pressure.|$|E

Usually they have lengths {{of the order of}} the <b>barometric</b> <b>scale</b> height in the corona that is 50 Mm. Previously {{it has been suggested that}} miniature versions of hot loops exist. These would have lengths of only 1 Mm barely protruding from the chromosphere and spanning across just one granule in the photosphere. Such short loops are well established at transition region temperatures (0. 1 MK), and we investigate if such miniature loops also exist at coronal temperatures (> 1 MK). We used extreme UV imaging (EUV) observations from the High-resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) at an unprecedented spatial resolution of 0. 3 " to 0. 4 ". Together with EUV imaging and magnetogram data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and X-Ray Telescope (XRT) data from Hinode we investigated the spatial, temporal and thermal evolution of small loop-like structures in the solar corona above a plage region close to an active region and compared this to a moss area within the active region. We find that the size, motion and temporal evolution of the loop-like features are consistent with photospheric motions, suggesting a close connection to the photospheric magnetic field. Aligned magnetograms show that one of their endpoints is rooted at a magnetic concentration. Their thermal structure, as revealed together with the X-ray observations, shows significant differences to moss-like features. Considering different scenarios, these features are most probably miniature versions of hot loops rooted at magnetic concentrations at opposite sides of a granule in small emerging magnetic loops (or flux tubes).
