5|$|A {{site for}} a church had <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> on the estate from the outset, and in 1884 Plumbe {{submitted}} designs for a church and mission hall. The mission hall opened in March 1885 with room for 350, and soon began to suffer from overcrowding. The people of Noel Park started a fund {{to pay for the}} church, which was consecrated on 1 November 1889 as St Mark's.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, NSB started leasing SJ T44-locomotives from Sweden to {{supplement}} the Di 3. In 1992, {{the decision was made}} to order 12 Di 6 and 20 Di 8 to replace the Di 3. The former was based on the Di 4 and had twice the power of the Di 3. The Di 8 was slightly more powerful than the Di 3, and were intended for freight trains. Both series were put into service in 1996, but the Di 6 proved to have so many technical problems that they were returned to Siemens in 1998. The Di 3 units had <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> and some had been scrapped, but the return of the Di 6 forced NSB to put the units back into service.|$|E
5|$|No {{preparations}} {{had been}} made for their reception, accommodation had not <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> and no food had been prepared. The children were placed {{in different parts of}} the camp based on their condition. The healthy and stronger children were housed in the barracks, weaker and sick children were accommodated in the castle, and the very weak and those suffering from typhus were lodged in the monastery. Only Serb children were kept in the camp, and they came from all over the NDH. They had previously been kept at the camps at Stara Gradiška, Jasenovac, Jablanac, Cerovljani, Mlaka, Gornja Reka and areas of Slavonia. Those accommodated in the barracks had no electricity or running water, and food initially consisted of little more than cornflour.|$|E

5|$|Already {{suffering}} from food shortages {{due to a}} five-month drought, President Fidel Castro announced {{that the government would}} supply people under the age of 14 and those over 60, which accounts for roughly 36% of Cuba's population, with extra food aid. An estimated 156,000 tonnes of food was set aside for this action and the food was worth several million dollars. People who qualified for the aid would receive 4.4lbs (2kg) of rice and peas if they lived in western Cuba and 6.6lbs (3kg) if they lived in eastern Cuba per month until July 1999. The United Nations World Food Program provided $20.5million in aid for both the effects of the drought and Georges. By December, the Cuban Government requested $90million to help recover from the hurricane and drought. By this time, about $40million had already <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> for the same reason. The Cuban Red Cross supplied shelter for more than 92,000 residents and supplied them with hygiene kits, food, water, and other relief materials.|$|E
5|$|Hayward did {{his initial}} naval {{training}} at the Naval Station Newport at Newport, Rhode Island. He was encouraged by the Chaplain, Father John J. Brady, to try for admission to United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. Brady arranged for Hayward {{to be sent to}} the Naval Academy Preparatory School in Norfolk, Virginia, to study for the entrance exams. During World War I, some one-hundred presidential appointments to Annapolis had <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> for enlisted sailors, but few had applied, and fewer still had passed the entrance exams. Of the 119 sailors who sat the exams in 1926, only 19 passed, one of whom was Hayward. He entered Annapolis in August 1926, and was commissioned as an ensign on graduation in June 1930, ranking 51st in his class of 406.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Romeo Guest, a {{building}} contractor, {{met with the}} North Carolina state treasurer, Brandon Hodges, {{and the president of}} Wachovia, Robert Hanes, to discuss building a research park in North Carolina to attract new industries to the region. They obtained support for the concept of Research Triangle Park from state governor Luther Hodges and the three universities that form the research triangle: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke University and North Carolina State University. The Research Triangle Institute (now RTI International) was formed as the research park's first tenant in 1958 by the park's founders. The following January they announced that $1.425 million had been raised by the Research Triangle Foundation to fund the park and that $500,000 of it had <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> for RTI.|$|E

5|$|The {{two months}} {{following}} the verdict were ones of great activity {{between the two parties}} and the citizens of Paris. As judicial duels were now so rare, no established battleground had <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside,</b> and a jousting arena at the Abbey of Saint-Martin-des-Champs north of the city agreed to host the combat. Both Carrouges and Le Gris endured bouts of illness in the weeks following the verdict but recovered with the aid of their families and supporters, who had joined the hundreds of people flocking to the city from nearby regions to witness the fight. Indeed, the event was so popular that when King Charles VI believed that his return to Paris in time for the combat would be held up in Flanders due to bad roads, he sent a fast messenger to Paris delaying the duel by a month in order that he would be present to witness it. This Royal intervention set the date for the combat back to 29 December 1386.|$|E
5|$|Gonzalo de Alvarado {{and his men}} {{decided to}} remain; the area was {{apparently}} well-populated enough to provide worthwhile tribute, {{and the existence of}} precious metal deposits in the region had already been established by earlier forays. Alvarado decided to found the new town of Gracias a Dios at Opoa, rather than at the nearby site that had <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> by Chávez. In late 1536, Gonzalo de Alvarado finally founded the new town, assigning officials as had been designated by his brother. Although 100 citizens had been assigned by Pedro de Alvarado, in reality it had about 40 upon its foundation. The town only remained at Opoa for a brief period, before it was transferred to a new site. Gonzalo and his men campaigned to impose their control over a wide area, penetrating as far as the Comayagua valley. Although claiming conquest of a wide region, Gonzalo had too few soldiers to effectively control it. Native resistance was such that the colonists were soon threatened by starvation, and the natives refused to serve the Spanish. San Pedro was in a similar situation, and was unable to provide any kind of relief to Gracias a Dios. The colonists appealed to Maldonado in Guatemala for assistance, and were informed that Francisco de Montejo would soon be taking up governorship, and would provide any assistance necessary.|$|E
