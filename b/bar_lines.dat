25|$|Today, {{music from}} the mensural period is {{normally}} transcribed into modern notation for performance or study, using a modern score layout, <b>bar</b> <b>lines</b> and often a modernized choice of clefs. A number of special editorial conventions for such transcriptions are common, especially in scholarly editions, where it is desirable that the basic characteristics of the original notation should be recoverable from the modern text.|$|E
25|$|Pachelbel {{employed}} white mensural notation {{when writing}} out numerous compositions (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias); a notational system that uses hollow note heads and omits <b>bar</b> <b>lines</b> (measure delimiters). The system had been widely used since the 15th century but was gradually being replaced {{in this period}} by modern notation (sometimes called black notation). In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity.|$|E
25|$|A {{special issue}} in {{representing}} Renaissance music {{is how to}} deal with its characteristic free-flowing rhythms, which very often include syncopated notes crossing the modern bar boundaries. To avoid the excessive use of ties and to allow for a notation more closely reflecting the original, some editions will print <b>bar</b> <b>lines</b> not across the staves, but only in the intermediate spaces between them (a convention sometimes referred to by the German term Mensurstrich), allowing notes to be read as lasting across a bar line.|$|E

25|$|During {{the time}} of the Franco-Flemish school in Renaissance music, use of the French {{notation}} system spread throughout Europe. This period brought the replacement of black with white notation. It also brought a further slowing down of the duration of the larger note values while introducing even more new small ones (fusa, semifusa etc.). Towards the end of this period, the original rules of perfection and imperfection became gradually obsolescent, as did the use of ligatures. During the 17th century, the system of mensuration signs and proportions gradually developed into the modern time signatures, and new notation devices for time measurements, such as <b>bar</b> <b>lines</b> and ties, were introduced, thus ultimately leading towards the modern notation system.|$|E
25|$|The decisive {{innovation}} of mensural notation was {{the systematic}} use of different note shapes to denote rhythmic durations that stood in well-defined, hierarchical numerical relations to each other. While less context dependent than notation in rhythmic modes, mensural notation {{differed from the}} modern system in that the values of notes were still somewhat context-dependent. In particular, a note could have the length of either two or three units of the next smaller order, whereas in modern notation these relations are invariably binary. Whether a note was to be read as ternary ("perfect") or binary ("imperfect") was a matter partly of context rules and partly {{of a system of}} mensuration signs comparable to modern time signatures. There was also a complex system of temporarily shifting note values by proportion factors like 2:1 or 3:2. Mensural notation used no <b>bar</b> <b>lines,</b> and it sometimes employed special connected note forms (ligatures) inherited from earlier medieval notation. Unlike in the earliest beginnings of the writing of polyphonic music, and unlike in modern practice, mensural notation was usually not written in a score arrangement but in individual parts.|$|E
500|$|Threni {{was first}} {{published}} by Boosey & Hawkes in 1958. Conducting from this score is difficult because of a shortage of <b>bar</b> <b>lines.</b> Asked by Robert Craft about this, Stravinsky said, [...] "The voices are not always in rhythmic unison. Therefore, any <b>bar</b> <b>lines</b> would cut at least one line arbitrarily". He recommended the conductor to [...] "merely count the music out as he counts out a motet by Josquin". However, a revised edition, with several changes to the barring {{as well as some}} corrections, was issued in 1965.|$|E

500|$|The {{sections}} {{comprising the}} cantata are traditionally grouped into four movements. The musicologist Carol Traupman-Carr notes: [...] "Although movements {{are marked by}} tempo changes, occasionally key changes, meter changes, and double <b>bar</b> <b>lines,</b> Cantata 106 {{appears to be a}} continuous work. Bach helps create a more seamless effect by occasionally resolving the cadence of one section at the downbeat of another, thus blurring the beginnings and endings of traditional movements." [...] The keys and tempo markings are taken from the first publication. The keys in the Neue Bach-Ausgabe and other more recent publications start in F major.|$|E
500|$|Rakim's rhyming {{deviated}} from the simple rhyme patterns of early 1980s hip hop. His free-rhythm style ignored <b>bar</b> <b>lines</b> and had earned comparisons to Thelonious Monk. The New York Times Ben Ratliff wrote that Rakim's [...] "unblustery rapping developed the form beyond the flat-footed rhythms of schoolyard rhymes". While many rappers developed their technique through improvisation, Rakim {{was one of}} the first to demonstrate advantages of a writerly style, as with for instance his pioneering use of internal rhyme. Unlike previous rappers such as LL Cool J and Run-D.M.C. who delivered their vocals with high energy, Rakim employed a relaxed, stoic delivery. According to MTV, [...] "We'd been used to MCs like Run and DMC, Chuck D and KRS-One leaping on the mic shouting with energy and irreverence, but Rakim took a methodical approach to his microphone fiending. He had a slow flow, and every line was blunt, mesmeric." [...] Rakim's relaxed delivery resulted from his jazz influences; he had played the saxophone and was a John Coltrane fan. His subject matter often covered his own rapping skills and lyrical superiority over other rappers.|$|E

But we may well, if the mood seems to us to demand it, dispense with all the others".|$|E
2500|$|As the [...] "Notes" [...] {{section of}} the music braille chart above {{indicate}}s, a single symbol shows both the pitch and rhythmic length of a note. [...] For instance, dots 1,4,5 indicate an eighth note (or 128th note) C. Every rhythm symbol in braille music does double duty—8th notes and 128th notes use the same symbols, as do quarter notes and 64th notes, half notes and 32nd notes, and whole notes and 16th notes. [...] Beginners first learn the most common rhythmic value (8th, quarter, half, and whole notes). [...] For advanced users there is never rhythmic ambiguity because the context, including time signature and <b>bar</b> <b>lines,</b> makes the intended rhythmic value clear. [...] For instance, in a measure of 4/4 time that includes only the symbol with dots 1,3,4 (whole or 16th rest), context says the symbol must indicate a whole rest.|$|E

2500|$|The Rite of Spring {{is notable}} for its {{relentless}} use of ostinati, {{for example in}} the eighth-note ostinato on strings accented by eight horns in the section [...] "Augurs of Spring (Dances of the Young Girls)". The work also contains passages where several ostinati clash against one another. Stravinsky was noted for his distinctive use of rhythm, especially in the Rite of Spring. According to the composer Philip Glass, [...] "the idea of pushing the rhythms across the <b>bar</b> <b>lines</b> [...] led the way [...] The rhythmic structure of music became much more fluid and {{in a certain way}} spontaneous". Glass mentions Stravinsky's [...] "primitive, offbeat rhythmic drive". According to Andrew J. Browne, [...] "Stravinsky is perhaps the only composer who has raised rhythm in itself to the dignity of art". Stravinsky's rhythm and vitality greatly influenced the composer Aaron Copland.|$|E
2500|$|A synth pad is a {{sustained}} chord or tone {{generated by a}} synthesizer, often employed for background harmony and atmosphere {{in much the same}} fashion that a string section is often used in orchestral music and film scores. [...] Typically, a synth pad is performed using whole notes, which are often tied over <b>bar</b> <b>lines.</b> A synth pad sometimes holds the same note while a lead voice sings or plays an entire musical phrase or section. [...] Often, the sounds used for synth pads have a vaguely organ, string, or vocal timbre. During the late 1970s and 1980s, specialized string synthesizers were made that specialized in cresting string sounds using the limited technology of the time. Much popular music in the 1980s employed synth pads, this being the time of polyphonic synthesizers, as did the then-new styles of smooth jazz and new-age music. [...] One of many well-known songs from the era to incorporate a synth pad is [...] "West End Girls" [...] by the Pet Shop Boys, who were noted users of the technique.|$|E

2500|$|The kindred spirits {{developing}} the new music gravitated to sessions at Minton's Playhouse, where Monk and Clarke {{were in the}} house band, and Monroe's Uptown House, where Max Roach {{was in the house}} band. [...] Part of the atmosphere created at jams like the ones found at Minton's Playhouse was an air of exclusivity: the [...] "regular" [...] musicians would often reharmonize the standards, add complex rhythmic and phrasing devices into their melodies, or [...] "heads," [...] and play them at breakneck tempos in order to exclude those whom they considered outsiders or simply weaker players. These pioneers of the new music (which would later be termed bebop or bop, although Parker himself never used the term, feeling it demeaned the music) began exploring advanced harmonies, complex syncopation, altered chords and chord substitutions. The bop musicians advanced these techniques with a more freewheeling, intricate and often arcane approach. Bop improvisers built upon the phrasing ideas first brought to attention by Lester Young's soloing style. They would often deploy phrases over an odd number of bars and overlap their phrases across <b>bar</b> <b>lines</b> and across major harmonic cadences. Christian and the other early boppers would also begin stating a harmony in their improvised line before it appeared in the song form being outlined by the rhythm section. This momentary dissonance creates a strong sense of forward motion in the improvisation. [...] The sessions also attracted top musicians in the swing idiom such as Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Ben Webster, Roy Eldridge, and Don Byas. [...] Byas became the first tenor saxophone player to fully assimilate the new bebop style in his playing. [...] In 1944 the crew of innovators was joined by Dexter Gordon, a tenor saxophone player from the west coast in New York with the Louis Armstrong band, and a young trumpet player attending the Juilliard School of Music, Miles Davis..|$|E
