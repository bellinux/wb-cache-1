[...] Skeptical {{respondents}} tend to find Satin's beyond-left-and-right policy proposals to be unrealistic and arrogant. [...] For example, political writer Charles R.

[...] Similarly, the policy director of the Democratic Leadership Council says Satin's book [...] "ultimately places him in the sturdy tradition of 'idealistic' American reformers who think smart and principled people unencumbered by political constraints can change everything." ...|$|E

5000|$|In round two, contestants {{are given}} nine 'subject headings' which {{generally}} have only an indirect and allusive {{relation to the}} topic underneath - for example, a question labelled [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] is {{as likely to be}} about geology as to be about music. However, in the first season these categories were a lot more clearly named. Contestants are asked to choose, in turn, one subject on which to receive a question. Each contestant makes two picks, so only six out of the nine subjects are asked. The question is then put to all contestants and the <b>Brains</b> <b>Trust.</b> The contestants are given five seconds to select their multiple choice answer, then the <b>Brains</b> <b>Trust</b> discusses the question and agree on its selection. If the <b>Brains</b> <b>Trust</b> gets the question right, all the players who also got the question right receive 50 points; if the <b>Brains</b> <b>Trust</b> are wrong, players who answered correctly receive 100 points. In the sixth season, this round was changed so each player would select one category per round instead of two, and the <b>Brains</b> <b>Trust</b> also selected one category.|$|R
500|$|Barkun {{argues that}} this {{statement}} is partly facetious (the claim of [...] "conspiracy" [...] and [...] "treason") and partly serious—the desire to encourage trilateral cooperation among the U.S., Europe, and Japan, for example—an ideal {{that used to be}} a hallmark of the internationalist wing of the Republican Party (known as [...] "Rockefeller Republicans" [...] in honor of Nelson Rockefeller) when there was an internationalist wing. The statement, however, is taken at face value and widely cited by conspiracy theorists as proof that the Council on Foreign Relations uses its role as the <b>brain</b> <b>trust</b> of American presidents, senators and representatives to manipulate them into supporting a New World Order {{in the form of a}} one-world government.|$|E

2500|$|Adolf A. Berle, like Moley {{a member}} of Roosevelt's First New Deal <b>Brain</b> <b>Trust,</b> was [...] "disappointed" [...] by the 1933 Banking Act. He wished the more {{extensive}} branch banking permission in earlier Glass bills had been adopted. [...] Berle concluded that limited branch banking with deposit insurance would preserve small banks certain to fail in an economic downturn, as they had consistently in the past. [...] While Berle shared Glass's hope that the new law's deposit insurance provisions would force all banks into the Federal Reserve System, he correctly feared that future Congresses would remove this requirement.|$|E

5000|$|In round three, 15 {{questions}} are {{put to the}} contestants and the <b>brains</b> <b>trust.</b> Two questions come {{from each of the}} contestants' special subjects, which are mixed in with nine other general knowledge questions. The round is a [...] "hands on buzzers" [...] round as seen in many quiz shows, with the <b>brains</b> <b>trust</b> sharing a buzzer. Contestants who get a question right receive 100 points - an incorrect answer means 100 points are deducted from their score. The <b>Brains</b> <b>Trust</b> receives no points for correct answers, but their intervention can deprive the contestants of points, which is presumably why their buzzer makes a different sound.|$|R

2500|$|Brian Lowry of Variety {{gave the}} fifth season premiere a {{positive}} review, saying: After the (rather too) long and winding road to Terminus, “The Walking Dead” opens its fifth season in spectacular fashion, a dazzling adrenaline rush filled with suspense, righteous violence and, before it’s all over, genuine emotion. Imbued with cinematic touches, the only downside to this breathtaking episode is pondering what the creative <b>brain</b> <b>trust</b> {{can do for}} an encore. Still, AMC’s megahit finds itself {{in a very good}} place, from the current makeup of its ever-evolving cast to the latitude it has earned to take unexpected detours.

2500|$|A {{conglomeration}} of disused, condemned buildings clustered {{together to}} form a self-contained habitat, Limitless Fortress is subdivided into three specific tiers – Lower Town, the Beltline and Babylon City. Lower Town is the lowest in altitude, with several layers extending below ground level. The Beltline, the most dangerous area of The Limitless Fortress, is ruled by Der Kaiser, Ban's father. Babylon City, the upper most level of the Limitless Fortress, is said to be where the <b>Brain</b> <b>Trust</b> resides, and is the home of Ginji's mother. In actuality, Babylon City is what one might consider the real world, with everything else being a virtual reality creation. Only those who have won the Ogre Battle may enter Babylon City and when that happens, they can change the world as they see fit. Both Ban and Ginji go to the Fortress with Ban wishing to rescue a kidnapped Himiko from Kagami, and Ginji finding a possibility to meet his mother. Going to the Beltline, the GetBackers encounter various warriors taking orders from a being known as Voodoo King from Babylon City. The Voodoo King seeks to obtain three [...] "keys" [...] which will help him unlock the gates from Babylon City sealed by Ban's grandmother several years ago. After finding the three keys: Shido's chimera spirit, Himiko's mirror and the GetBackers, the Voodoo King is faced by Ginji, Thunder Emperor alter-ego attacks him in a clash which destroys the Voodoo King and making Raitei disappear forever as he existed to balance the scales. With Voodoo King gone, Raitei's purpose was fulfilled and he disappeared forever. Following this, both Ban and Ginji face each other in Ogre Battle with Ban giving up, impressed with Ginji's will. Ginji goes to Babylon City where he meets his mother from a parallel universe, who explains how she created the Fortress and its surrounding [...] world. Following a discussion between the two of them, the Fortress' world remains unchanged except that the virtual people living become real beings. Ban and Ginji continue their retrieval job, ending the series when requested to go on a mission that will lead them to meet Ban's mother.|$|E
