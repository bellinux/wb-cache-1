Yet historian Patricia Ebrey states that legal cases in the Song period portrayed the courts as <b>being</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> with cases of neighbors and relatives suing each other over property rights. The Song author and official Yuan Cai (1140–1190) repeatedly warned against this, and like other officials of his time also cautioned his readers about the rise of banditry in Southern Song society and a need to physically protect self and property.|$|E
5|$|Though Igor's closest {{approach}} to the contiguous United States only brought it within 600mi (970km) of land, its large circulation produced significant swells along the entire East Coast. High surf advisories were issued in Long Island, New York as waves of 6 to 10ft (1.8 to 3.0m) affected the area. Rip currents in Florida pulled two people out to sea who were later rescued. One person drowned in Surf City, North Carolina after <b>being</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by rough surf. Along the New Jersey coastline, waves averaging between 6 and 9ft (1.8 and 2.7m) and dangerous rip currents were reported.|$|E
5|$|From Verbrandesmis a road runs north-west, {{parallel}} with the lower Steenbeek through Merckem to Luyghem, slightly above {{the level of the}} surrounding marshes. Machine-guns nests in the villages, commanded the causeway from Drei Grachten; the ground everywhere in the peninsula was soaked and dotted with large numbers of blockhouses and pillboxes. The French artillery destroyed Verbrandesmis and it was quickly captured but the German garrisons at Jesiutengoed Farm and Kloostermolen held out for some time, before being driven out and forced back to Kippe and Aschhoop. German artillery bombarded the banks of the Steenbeek in front of Merckem and French troops rushed across on pontoon bridges, struggled through the mud to the objectives and then attacked towards Kippe and Luyghem. Kippe and Aschhoop were captured quickly but the German garrisons at Luyghem and the causeway from Drei Grachten, resisted until afternoon before <b>being</b> <b>overwhelmed.</b>|$|E

5|$|His {{retreating}} army were continuously harried by the Spartans {{under the}} command of Areus. By setting ambushes and occupying important positions along the Epiriote line of retreat, the Spartans were able to inflicted significant casualties on Pyrrhus' rearguard of Gauls and Molossians. In an attempt to counter the panic and crumbling morale of his rear which was engaging the Spartans, Pyrrhus sent his son Ptolemy to take command. By doing this, Pyrrhus' hope was that his son's presence would rally the rearguard and give him enough time to extricate the rest of his army from the narrow pass through which they were marching. The battle intensified around Ptolemy's position and he was set upon by a picked Spartan band led by Evaclus. In the fight that ensued, Ptolemy was slain and his remaining troops <b>being</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by the triumphant Spartans. Upon hearing of his son's death and the disintegration of his rearguard, Pyrrhus charged the Spartans with his Molossian cavalry, killing Evaclus with his own hand before destroying the remainder of his picked Spartan troops. With the defeat of Evaclus' force, Pyrrhus was able to withdraw the rest of his army from Laconia.|$|E
5|$|With {{the wind}} strengthening, Schomberg marshalled his forces and {{advanced}} on Roquebert's squadron. The French were clustered together {{in support of}} Néréide, whose crew were attempting to make hasty repairs while the squadron limped in a northwesterly direction towards Madagascar. Following the French lights, Schomberg pursued the French in the darkness and when Clorinde lost a man overboard and stopped to rescue him at 21:50, Roquebert was forced to fall back and protect his consort from <b>being</b> <b>overwhelmed.</b> Steering Renommée directly at Astraea, Roquebert opened fire at close range but was soon surrounded, with Astraea on one side, Racehorse on the other and Phoebe raking her stern. In a ferocious 25 minute engagement, Roquebert was killed and the French flagship suffered severe damage, surrendering after a shot from Racehorse ignited her mainsail. The British ships were also badly damaged: Racehorse was unable to launch a boat to take possession of Renommée due to a fallen topmast on her deck and Astraeas boats all badly damaged by shot and leaked severely during the short row to the stricken French vessel.|$|E
5|$|After causing {{severe damage}} in the United States, the {{remnants}} of Hurricane Bob moved into Atlantic Canada. The highest rainfall amount in the country was 4.37in (111mm) in northern New Brunswick. St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador recorded a record 1inch (26mm) of rainfall during the storm's passage. Gusty winds were observed across the region, and winds reached 68mph (109km/h) in Digby, Nova Scotia. In Nova Scotia, two 17-year-old girls were washed out to sea near Cape Forchu after being caught in rough swells produced by the storm. Rescue officials quickly began searching operations; however, it was later confirmed that the two had drowned. In Fredericton, New Brunswick, tropical storm-force winds downed trees and power lines, resulting in scattered power outages. Lightning associated with strong storms also reportedly struck some trees in the area. A two-story home in Pointe-Verte collapsed due to high winds. In Petit-Rocher, five fishing boats sank after <b>being</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by large swells at port. Firefighters in the area were surveying the town all night on August20, checking for downed power lines and trees. Power outages were also reported on Prince Edward Island. The storm left about $1million in damage (1991CAD) on Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy.|$|E

Wetz learned even more from Bruckner, his clear form structures and the sense of an organic growth of the music without it <b>being</b> <b>overwhelming.</b> Nevertheless, a large measure due to Bruckner, he typically composed powerful and ceremonious effects without stylistic peculiarities.|$|R

25|$|The West Indies Federation had {{an unusually}} weak federal structure. For instance, its provinces were not {{contained}} in a single customs union.

Also, complete freedom of movement within the Federation was not implemented, as the larger provinces were worried about mass migration from the smaller islands.

25|$|Jung {{established}} {{a school of}} psychology which emphasizes the human quest for wholeness (which he defined as the integration of conscious and unconscious components of the psyche) through a process called individuation.

25|$|Self-esteem was {{believed}} to be a cultural phenomenon of Western individualistic societies since low self-esteem was not occurring in collectivist countries such as Japan. The idea of low self-esteem and its many negative consequences led California assemblyman John Vasconcellos to work to create and fund the Task Force on Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility in California in 1986. Vasconcellos argued that this task force could combat many of the state's problems from crime and teen pregnancy to school underachievement and pollution. He compared increasing self-esteem to giving out a vaccine for a disease: it could help protect people from <b>being</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by life's challenges.|$|E
