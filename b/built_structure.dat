25|$|A small {{engine shed}} was opened {{close to the}} station in 1864, and {{extended}} in 1867. This was demolished by the Great Western Railway in 1938 {{to make way for}} a larger brick <b>built</b> <b>structure,</b> which is still standing. The shed was not allocated a code by British Railways since it was deemed a sub-shed of Machynlleth, and so locomotives bore that depot's code, 89C.|$|E

40|$|The bearing of lasting <b>built</b> <b>structures</b> {{in driving}} the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) cannot be overemphasized. The SDGs agenda {{is a plan}} of action for eradicating poverty among the people of the world, {{strengthening}} universal peace and laying the foundation for sustainable development and prosperity for all. The quality of <b>built</b> <b>structures</b> in an environment defines the level of advancement attained by the society, for which the quality of structures that will lay the base for sustainable development must be reliable. No meaningful development can be achieved without reliable <b>built</b> <b>structures.</b> In fact, all the 17 SDGs need consistent <b>built</b> <b>structures</b> to be achieved. This paper researches on the reliability of <b>built</b> <b>structures</b> as a base for sustainable development with particular emphasis on Nigerian building structures. Statistical method is used to analyze data on failed building structures. Results obtained point {{to the fact that the}} failure rate and the casualty rate of Nigerian building structures are very high. As safety of human lives is implicitly embedded in the SDGs, much have to be done to raise the standard of building that will contribute to the achievement of the SDGs...|$|R

The multidisciplinary study analysed the influence and impact of <b>built</b> <b>structures</b> on hydrology, fish, and ultimately on people. The project established a database of major structures around the Tonle Sap Lake. Hydrologists modeled the influence of infrastructure on the flow and quality of water. Environmental scientists analysed information about how infrastructure affects the environment. Experts in ecology and fish biology assessed teh direct impacts on fisheries. Social scientists and economists evaluated the influence of infrastructure development on people's livelihoods, and studied local people's insights related to the planning, construction, and operation of <b>built</b> <b>structures.</b> Inland fisheries, Environmental impact, Structures, Man-induced effects, Cambodia, Tonle Sap L.,...|$|R
25|$|On the {{standard}} gauge railway {{there are two}} engine sheds in the colliery yard, the smaller brick, wood and metal structure being an operational building, the larger brick <b>built</b> <b>structure</b> being presented as Beamish Engine Works, a reconstruction of an engine shed formerly at Beamish 2nd Pit. Used for locomotive and stock storage, it is a long, single track shed featuring a servicing pit for part of its length, visitors can walk along the full length in a segregated corridor. A third engine shed has been constructed {{at the southern end}} of the yard (i.e. the other side of the heapstead to the other two sheds), also in brick (lower half) and corrugated iron, and is used for both narrow and standard gauge vehicles (on one road), although it is not connected to either system - instead being fed by low-loaders and used for long term storage only.|$|E
25|$|When, in {{the middle}} of the 9th century (868), Alfonso III of León created the {{administrative}} and military region, that he called Terra de Santa Maria, he laid its defences in the military fortress that existed there, in Civitas Sanctae Mariae. For many years, the fortress functioned as a forward base in the Christian Reconquista from the Arab invasions from the south. Twice in 1000, the armies of Al-Mansur conquered the Castle and destroyed the local population, but they were retaken successively by Christian forces. During the reign of Bermudo III (1028–1037) Arab continued to attempt to capture the Castle, but were defeated definitively in the Battle of Cesár. The governors, Mem Guterres and Mem Lucídio developed a giant project to reconstruct the Castle and develop the lands of the Terra de Santa Maria. The Leonese kings distinguished the population with the Honra de Infanções, an honour at the time only received by the judges, magistrates and councilmen of Lisbon. The first reference to a <b>built</b> <b>structure</b> in this location occurred in the 11th century, in the Chronica Gothorum, identifying the construction of the inferior portion of the keep and fortress. Since 1117, Feira was the location of one of the most important fairs in Portugal, which, over time, gave the town its name. The fair was established in the shadow of the castle.|$|E

2500|$|The medieval settlement, {{which grew}} as a planned town located by the Norman castle, is {{largely on the}} top of a hill, with the castle, market and parish church (St Laurence's) {{situated}} along the flat land on this hilltop, which has a maximum elevation of [...] on College Street. The streets then run down to the Rivers Teme and Corve (their confluence being to the northwest of the centre of Ludlow) to the north and south. The surface of the Teme has an approximate elevation of [...] as it passes Ludford Bridge. To the west is Dinham, which retains the character of a village, though dominated by the castle, with a road leading steeply down from Castle Square to the Teme and then over Dinham Bridge (an early 19th century replacement of an older bridge very slightly downstream). The old chapel in Dinham, a Grade II* listed building, though no longer used for worship, features the oldest <b>built</b> <b>structure</b> in Ludlow outside the castle. To the east a rolling landscape exists, and it is in this direction that the town has steadily grown. East Hamlet was the name of the settlement to the east of the town.|$|E
2500|$|Despite their proximity, the {{two towers}} differ greatly in construction, a {{difference}} that {{extends to the}} breastwork as well, pointing to a construction at different dates. The southern tower is an irregularly quadrilateral two-story structure. Its masonry is very uneven, including several stone pillars that have been inserted into it, often not fully, and its counterfort is made of small, irregularly fitted stones. Its interior arrangement, with its spacious upper story, large windows, and westward-facing balcony, suggests a use as a residential tower. Combined, these factors strongly support its traditional identification with the so-called Tower of Isaac Angelos: according to the historian Niketas Choniates, that tower was built by Emperor Isaac II Angelos (r. 1185–1195, 1203–1204) both as a fort and a private residence, and made use of materials from ruined churches. In contrast, the northern tower, which is identified as the Tower of Anemas proper, is a carefully <b>built</b> <b>structure,</b> displaying the typically Byzantine alternating layers of stone masonry and bricks. Its buttress is built of large, regular, carefully fitted blocks. The strength of {{the walls and the}} buttresses is explained by considering that this structure formed the westernmost retaining wall of the large terraced hill upon which the late Byzantine Palace of Blachernae was built.|$|E
2500|$|Tolstoy was {{a master}} of prose; both his novella The Vampire (praised by Vissarion Belinsky) and his novel Prince Serebrenni {{received}} a lot of good press. The latter, though, was criticised for being tendentious; many argued that both the main character and Yelena Morozova looked very much like people of the 19th, rather than 16th century. On the other hand, Ivan Grozny and the oprichnina horrors were depicted with great vividness and passion; the novel's masterfully <b>built</b> <b>structure,</b> its rich musical language made it a perfect Walter Scott-type of book for adolescents, according to Vengerov. [...] "The novel is highly involving… finely structured and well-written," [...] Ivan Turgenev wrote, recommending it to a French publisher. Still, as a prosaic Tolstoy made much less of an impact than as a poet. He’s been lauded as a classic of the 19th century Russian historical drama. D. S. Mirsky regarded Tolstoy as a dramatist superior to Aleksander Ostrovsky, describing his plays as [...] "full of intriguing ideas and brilliantly crafted characters. They impress us with intelligence and insight rather than [...] with flights of imagination, but in Tsar Fyodor Tolstoy managed to create {{one of the most interesting}} characters in Russian literature: that of a kind and weak ruler who has a keen sense of justice but is unable to make his evil aids implement his good will." ...|$|E
