5|$|In 1900, Hart's brother Walter {{travelled}} to South Africa {{for service}} with the Fourth Contingent in the Second Boer War. This inspired Hart {{to volunteer for}} the Eighth New Zealand South African Contingent, but his application was declined. However, he, along with another brother, George, successfully enlisted for the Ninth Contingent. The minimum age for volunteers was 20 and he falsified his age to enlist. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> South Africa in April 1902, the war was effectively over. He was discharged in July 1902 with the rank of lance sergeant but travelled to England instead of returning to New Zealand {{with the rest of}} the contingent.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{he began}} the Marathon of Hope, a {{cross-country}} run {{to raise money for}} cancer research. He hoped to raise one dollar from each of Canada's 24 million people. He began with little fanfare from St. John's, Newfoundland, in April and ran the equivalent of a full marathon every day. Fox had become a national star <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> Ontario; he made numerous public appearances with businessmen, athletes, and politicians in his efforts to raise money. He was forced to end his run outside Thunder Bay when the cancer spread to his lungs. His hopes of overcoming the disease and completing his marathon ended when he died nine months later.|$|E
5|$|Maclean {{raised a}} force of about 180 Emigrants, {{and a number of}} militia. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> Sorel on October 14, he had raised, in {{addition}} to the Emigrants, about 400 militia men, sometimes using threatening tactics to gain recruits. His and Carleton's hopes were dashed on October 30, when Carleton's attempted landing at Longueuil of a force numbering about 1,000 (mostly militia, with some Emigrants and Indian support) was repulsed by the Americans. A few of his boats were landed, but most were driven off by Seth Warner's use of field artillery that had been captured at Chambly.|$|E

Rumors were that he was two stones {{stronger}} than any other Go player. This was due to his deep thinking and next-level tactics. He laid the foundation for opening strategy in the Golden Period.|$|R

5|$|After {{separating}} from Leissègues on 15 December, Willaumez sailed south, capturing {{a number}} of vessels from a British troop convoy and sending the prizes, with the frigate Volontaire, to Tenerife. Willaumez's intention was to raid the China Fleet, a large convoy of valuable East Indiamen that sailed from the Far East to Britain every year. However, on 23 December he was pursued by Duckworth and driven far off course, so that <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> the Cape of Good Hope, where he planned to resupply his ships, {{it had already been}} captured by a British expeditionary force. Turning westwards, Willaumez raided shipping in the South Atlantic until April, when he anchored at Salvador in neutral Brazil. By early May, Willaumez was at sea again, stopping at Cayenne and then splitting his force to raid shipping in the Leeward Islands prior to reuniting at Fort-de-France on Martinique in June.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> his teens, Gygax had a {{voracious}} {{appetite for}} pulp fiction authors such as Robert Howard, Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, H. P. Lovecraft, and Edgar Burroughs. Gygax was a mediocre student, and in 1956, {{a few months}} after his father died, he {{dropped out of high school}} in his junior year. He briefly joined the Marines, but after being diagnosed with walking pneumonia, he was given a medical discharge and moved back home with his mother. From there, he commuted to a job as shipping clerk with Kemper Insurance Co. in Chicago. Shortly after his return, a friend introduced him to Avalon Hill's new wargame Gettysburg, and Gygax was soon obsessed with the game, often playing marathon sessions once a week or more. It was also from Avalon Hill that he ordered the first blank hexagon mapping sheets that were available, which he then employed to design his own games.|$|E
5|$|Caxias {{was growing}} old, and was ill and {{exhausted}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> Asunción. As {{he did not}} feel up to the task of pursuing López into the Paraguayan hinterland, he asked to be either relieved of his post or given a short leave. Although his request was denied, he appointed a senior member of his staff as acting commander, and left for Brazil on 19 January 1869. The Emperor was angered that the marquis had left his post without permission, and especially that Caxias had declared the war to have been already won—even though López was still at large and regrouping his few remaining military assets. Caxias' ill-conceived decision seriously endangered the hard-won achievements of the past months, even as the objective of eliminating López as a threat remained tantalizingly within reach.|$|E

5|$|Terry-Thomas {{was born}} Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens at 53 Lichfield Grove, Finchley, North London. He {{was the third}} of four {{children}} born to Ernest Frederick Stevens, managing director of a butcher's business at Smithfield Market and part-time amateur actor, and his wife Ellen Elizabeth Stevens (née Hoar). As a child, Terry-Thomas was {{often referred to as}} Tom, the diminutive used by his family. He led a generally happy childhood, but believed that his parents secretly desired a daughter in his place. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> adolescence, his parents' marriage had failed and both became alcoholics. In an attempt to bring them together, Terry-Thomas often entertained them by performing impromptu slapstick routines, reciting jokes and singing and dancing around the family home. The performances seldom worked, and his father became increasingly removed from his family. His parents had divorced by the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|On 7 July 1913 Dyer faced Jack Delaney for {{the vacant}} Wales Area Welterweight title, despite Delaney being English. The fight was staged at the Skating Rink on Westgate Street in Cardiff and was {{scheduled}} for 20 rounds. The fight went the distance and Dyer was awarded the bout on points decision, making him the Welsh welterweight champion. He held the title for just over a month when a rematch for the title ended in victory for Delaney. Despite the loss, a win over Gus Platts—who would later become British and European middleweight champion—in October resulted in Dyer being touted {{as one of the}} preferred challengers to the British welterweight champion Johnny Summers. Summers though had travelled to Australia to extend his boxing campaign, and in the spring of 1914 Dyer decided to follow him abroad to challenge for his title. Dyer stopped off en route in South Africa to play music halls in a bid to help pay his fares. Dyer entertained with a mixture of songs and shadow boxing, and challenged all-comers to fight with him {{at the end of the}} show. Unfortunately for Dyer, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> Australia, Summers had already returned to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Peter then {{returned}} to Constantinople with letters from Theodahad and the Roman Senate to the imperial couple, bearing pleas for a peaceful solution, but <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> the imperial capital, Emperor Justinian had resolved on war and was preparing his forces. Consequently, Peter returned to Italy {{in the summer of}} 535 conveying an ultimatum: only if Theodahad abdicated and returned Italy to imperial rule, could war be averted. A two-pronged Byzantine offensive followed soon thereafter, attacking the outlying possessions of the Ostrogothic kingdom: Belisarius took Sicily, while Mundus invaded Dalmatia. Upon hearing these news, Theodahad despaired, and Peter was able to secure wide-ranging concessions from him: Sicily was to be ceded to the Byzantine Empire; the Gothic king's authority within Italy was severely restricted; a gold crown was to be sent as an annual tribute and up to 3,000 men were to be provided for the imperial army, underlining Theodahad's subject status. Theodahad, however, fearing that his first offer would be rejected, then instructed Peter, under oath, to offer the cession of all Italy, but only if the original concessions were rejected by Justinian. In the event, Justinian rejected the first proposal, and was delighted to learn of the second one. Peter was sent back to Italy with Athanasius, bearing letters to Theodahad and the Gothic nobles, and for a time {{it seemed as if the}} cradle of the Roman Empire would return peacefully to the fold. It was not to be: upon their arrival in Ravenna, the Byzantine envoys found Theodahad in a changed disposition. Supported by the Gothic nobility and buoyed up by a success against Mundus in Dalmatia, he resolved to resist, and imprisoned the ambassadors.|$|E

5|$|The Crown {{responded to}} reports of anarchy in Honduras by naming the elderly Diego Alvítez as the royal governor. Alvítez's fleet was wrecked some leagues away from Trujillo {{towards the end}} of October 1532, and he {{finished}} his journey on foot. By the time he arrived in the colonial capital, soon after Cerezeda had taken sole charge, he was near death. On 2 November, he named Cerezeda as acting governor, and died soon afterwards. Opposing factions once again formed, one of them headed by Diego Díaz de Herrera, and Cerezeda clung to power with great difficulty. To stabilise the province, he organised another expedition to settle the Naco valley. He sent a captain with sixty soldiers south and intended to follow with reinforcements, but was delayed in Trujillo by reports of a Spanish expedition approaching along the coast from the west. The new arrivals were led by Alonso D'Ávila, one of the officers of Francisco de Montejo, who had been named adelantado of Yucatán. D'Ávila had been attempting to establish a Spanish town {{on the east side of}} the Yucatán Peninsula, but had been forced out by native resistance. Since the entire region was at war with the Spanish, D'Ávila was unable to return to Montejo, and instead forayed along the Caribbean coast in canoes, looking for a suitable location to establish a new settlement. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> Puerto de Caballos, his expedition was in a perilous state. D'Ávila appealed to Cerezeda for assistance, and the latter sent out supplies to the beleaguered party. D'Ávila and his men finally arrived in Trujillo in early 1533.|$|E

At ten o'clock on 19 August, Gustav mounted his horse and rode to the arsenal. On the way, his adherents joined him in little groups, as if by accident, so that <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> his destination he had about 200 officers in his suite.|$|E
25|$|Early in the 1920s the Dantzig {{family moved}} from Baltimore to Washington. His mother became a {{linguist}} at the Library of Congress, {{and his father}} became a math tutor at the University of Maryland, College Park, Dantzig attended Powell Junior High School and Central High School; {{one of his friends}} there was Abraham Seidenberg, who also became a professional mathematician. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> high school he was already fascinated by geometry, and this interest was further nurtured by his father, challenging him with complicated problems, particularly in projective geometry.|$|E
25|$|Sívori {{was born}} in San Nicolás de los Arroyos, a town which falls within the Buenos Aires Province, in an Italian Argentine family. His {{paternal}} grandfather, Giulio Sivori, was an immigrant from Cavi di Lavagna, a hamlet {{in the province of}} Genoa, while his mother Carolina was of Abruzzian descent. As a youngster Sívori became heavily interested in the game of football and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> his teens he was signed up to a side from the city of Buenos Aires, River Plate. The teenage Sívori was given a chance to break through into a squad which included players like the famed forwards Ángel Labruna and Félix Loustau who established themselves in the era of La Máquina, one of the foremost formations in football history. He soon earned the nickname El Cabezón (bighead) from the fans, due to his hair, outspokenness, confidence, arrogance, and playing style.|$|E

25|$|Logic {{suggests}} that Ward's fate {{was destined to}} be much the same. However, in Ward's case, his invention enabled him to turn his fate to his immense advantage. Family members state that the fact that the travels associated with the promotion of his invention took him away from the farm a lot was not something city-bred Ward considered to be disagreeable. In fact, his son David Bryant King had pretty much taken over operation of the farm <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> eighteen. Leffler, after many years on his Hancock County farm, was finally able to move back to Springfield to help his father manage the family's considerable real estate holdings during his father's declining years. Like his brother, his son Edwin Askam King pretty much took over the operation of Grassland Farm. Although separated by distance, the brothers always remained very close, and they constantly worked together on the family's real estate undertakings in Springfield. Ironically, in the remarkably parallel lives of these two Springfield-reared farmers, their children were more farm people than they were.|$|E
500|$|In 1792, King Rana Bahadur Shah of Nepal, {{with whom}} the company had {{established}} trade relations, requested military assistance.

[...] Cornwallis declined the king's request, sending instead Colonel William Kirkpatrick to mediate the dispute.
