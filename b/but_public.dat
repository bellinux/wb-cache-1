5|$|The ACLU lost an {{important}} press censorship case when, in 1957, the Supreme Court upheld the obscenity conviction of publisher Samuel Roth for distributing adult magazines. As late as 1953, {{books such as}} Tropic of Cancer and From Here to Eternity were still banned. <b>But</b> <b>public</b> standards rapidly became more liberal though the 1960s, and obscenity was notoriously difficult to define, so by 1971 prosecutions for obscenity had halted.|$|E
5|$|At {{the inauguration}} on 9 September 2008, Afghan President Hamid Karzai {{was a guest}} of honour, which was a signal for much closer {{cooperation}} {{between the two nations}} in addressing the tribal insurgency along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. After the election, Zardari promised to approve the constitutional provision that removed the President's power to dismiss Parliament, <b>but</b> <b>public</b> scepticism remained on whether he would actually carry out his promise. His economic competence was questioned after allegations that he had raised grain procurement prices through inflationary subsidies and scrapped the capital gains tax. His first parliamentary speech was overshadowed by 20 September Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing. A few days later, he went to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on his first overseas trip as President.|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} 1994 Australian Grand Prix, the final {{race of the}} 1994 season, Schumacher led Damon Hill by a single point in the Drivers' Championship. Schumacher led the race from the beginning, but on lap 35 he went off track and hit the wall with his right side wheels, {{returning}} to the track at reduced speed, and with car damage, but still leading the race. At the next corner Hill attempted {{to pass on the}} inside, but Schumacher turned in sharply and they collided. Both cars were eliminated from the race and, as neither driver scored, Schumacher took the title. The race stewards judged it a racing accident and took no action against either driver, <b>but</b> <b>public</b> opinion is divided over the incident, and Schumacher was vilified in the British media.|$|E

5|$|Minton {{was pleased}} with Roosevelt's bill and quickly became its leading {{supporter}} in the Senate. The measure was placed in an omnibus bill designed to reform judicial salaries and districting, among many other measures. Republicans quickly discovered the court-packing provision and targeted the bill. Democrats had overwhelming super-majorities in Congress, and passage of the bill at first seemed assured. Minton's support of the bill helped him earn the position of Senate majority whip, allowing him to more effectively push for its passage. Minton delivered six radio addresses {{on behalf of his}} party in support of the bill, <b>but</b> <b>public</b> opinion could not be swayed in the Democrats' favor.|$|E
5|$|Wartime Mikkeli is {{identified}} with Marshal Mannerheim, {{the commander of}} the Finnish army and later President of Finland. His personal railway carriage, which he used as a command post during the war, is parked in a siding at Mikkeli station. It is possible to look inside the carriage through its windows at any time. <b>But</b> <b>public</b> entry to the carriage is only permitted once a year, on Mannerheim's birthday (June 4). The carriage was the venue of Mannerheim's famous 1942 meeting (near Immola) with Hitler, on which occasion a private conversation between the two men was secretly recorded. Photographs of this meeting are on display in the carriage. Mannerheim was a regular diner at the Mikkelin Klubi, where his favourite drink was schnapps.|$|E
5|$|B {{service was}} also cut due to {{financial}} {{problems in the}} late 1930s and again after World War II; by 1950, Pittsfield was served by eight Boston-Albany round trips per day. The four daily trips to North Adams ended in 1953. The opening of the Massachusetts Turnpike in 1957 and the Berkshire Thruway two years later provided {{for the first time}} an auto route to western Massachusetts superior to the narrow and winding Route 20; this effectively decimated long distance service on the B In January 1960 the NYC received permission to discontinue all B service that April, <b>but</b> <b>public</b> outcry prevented full cancellation. On April 24, 1960, stops west of Framingham except Worcester, Palmer, Springfield, and Pittsfield were closed; Boston-Albany service via Pittsfield was reduced to just 3.5 daily round trips. Still facing losses, the B was finally fully absorbed into the NYC in 1961, effectively subsidized by its popular New York commuter service. The crack New England States, introduced in 1938, was combined with the 20th Century Limited west of Buffalo on November 5, 1967. After the latter was discontinued on December 2, the New England States lost its named distinction on December 3.|$|E

5|$|News of the war's end {{was brought}} by Pereira Pinto {{and met with}} joy in Rio de Janeiro. Brazilian Emperor Dom PedroII found himself waylaid by a crowd of {{thousands}} in the streets amid acclamations. <b>But</b> <b>public</b> opinion quickly changed for the worse, when newspapers began running stories painting the accord of 20 February as harmful to Brazilian interests, for which the cabinet was blamed. The newly raised Viscount of Tamandaré and Mena Barreto (now Baron of São Gabriel) had supported the peace accord. Tamandaré changed his mind soon afterward and played along with the allegations. Paranhos (a member of the opposition party) {{was used as a}} scapegoat by the Emperor and the government, and was recalled in disgrace to the imperial capital. Subsequent events show the accusation was unfounded. Not only had Paranhos managed to settle all Brazilian claims, but by avoiding the death of thousands, he gained a willing and grateful Uruguayan ally, not a dubious and resentful one — who provided Brazil an important base of operations during the war with Paraguay that followed.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell of}} Cloud Gate was fully erected {{for the grand}} opening of Millennium Park on July 15, 2004, {{although}} it was unpolished and thus unfinished, because its assembly had fallen behind schedule. The piece was temporarily uncovered on July 8 for the opening, although Kapoor was unhappy with this as it allowed the public to see the sculpture in an unfinished state. The original plan was to re-erect the tent around the sculpture for polishing on July 24, <b>but</b> <b>public</b> appreciation for the piece convinced park officials to leave it uncovered for several months. The tent was again erected in January 2005 as a 24-person crew from Ironworkers Local 63 polished the seams between each plate. In order to grind, sand and polish the seams, six levels of scaffolding were erected around {{the sides of the}} sculpture, while climbing ropes and harnesses were used to polish harder-to-reach areas. When the upper and side portions of the shell were completed, the tent was once again removed in August 2005. On October 3, the omphalos was closed off as workers polished the final section. Every weld on the Cloud Gate underwent a five-stage process, required to produce the sculpture's mirror-like finish.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend toward}} {{artificial}} ice was hastened by the regular ice famines during the period, {{such as the}} 1898 British famine, which typically caused rapid price increases, fuelled demand for plant ice and encouraged investment in the new technologies. Concerns also grew over the safety of natural ice. Initial reports concerning ice being produced from polluted or unclean lakes and rivers had first emerged in the U.S. {{as early as the}} 1870s. The British public health authorities believed Norwegian ice was generally much purer and safer than American sourced ice, but reports in 1904 noted the risk of contamination in transit and recommended moving to the use of plant ice. In 1907, New York specialists claimed ice from the Hudson River to be unsafe for consumption and potentially containing typhoid germs; the report was successfully challenged by the natural ice industry, <b>but</b> <b>public</b> opinion was turning against natural ice on safety grounds. These fears of contamination was often played on by artificial ice manufacturers in their advertising. Major damage was also done to the industry by fire, including a famous blaze at the American Ice Company facilities at Iceoboro in 1910, which destroyed the buildings and the adjacent schooners, causing around $130,000 ($2,300,000 in 2010 terms) of damage and crippling the Maine ice industry.|$|E

25|$|Secret {{societies}} {{have been a}} part of University of Virginia student life since the founding of the Eli Banana society in 1878.

25|$|By March 1937, public {{exposure}} of the Remington Rand company's anti-union efforts had led to a significant deterioration in the firm's public support.
