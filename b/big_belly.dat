5|$|The B-52D was a {{dedicated}} long-range bomber without a reconnaissance option. The <b>Big</b> <b>Belly</b> modifications allowed the B-52D to carry heavy loads of conventional bombs for carpet bombing over Vietnam, while the Rivet Rambler modification added the Phase V ECM systems, which {{was better than}} the systems used on most later B-52s. Because of these upgrades and its long range capabilities, the D model was used more extensively in Vietnam than any other model. Aircraft assigned to Vietnam were painted in a camouflage colour scheme with black bellies to defeat searchlights.|$|E
5|$|Kubera {{is often}} {{depicted}} as a dwarf, with complexion of lotus leaves and a <b>big</b> <b>belly.</b> He is described as having three legs, only eight teeth, one eye, and being adorned with jewels. He is sometimes depicted riding a man. The description of deformities like the broken teeth, three legs, three heads and four arms appear only in the later Puranic texts. Kubera holds a mace, a pomegranate or a money bag in his hand. He may also carry a sheaf of jewels or a mongoose with him. In Tibet, the mongoose is considered a symbol of Kubera's victory over Nāgas—the guardians of treasures. Kubera is usually depicted with a mongoose in Buddhist iconography.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in late 1965, {{a number}} of B-52Ds {{underwent}} <b>Big</b> <b>Belly</b> modifications to increase bomb capacity for carpet bombings. While the external payload remained at 24 of 500lb (227kg) or 750lb (340kg) bombs, the internal capacity increased from 27 to 84 for 500lb bombs, or from 27 to 42 for 750lb bombs. The modification created enough capacity {{for a total of}} 60,000lb (27,215kg) using 108 bombs. Thus modified, B-52Ds could carry 22,000lb (9,980kg) more than B-52Fs. Designed to replace B-52Fs, modified B-52Ds entered combat in April 1966 flying from Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. Each bombing mission lasted 10 to 12 hours and included an aerial refueling by KC-135 Stratotankers. In spring 1967, B-52s began flying from U Tapao Airfield in Thailand so that refueling was not required.|$|E

500|$|Asked in July 2006 {{what she}} hoped for Kyla {{in the long}} run, Ayola responded: [...] "Most of all I’d {{like to see her}} laugh, <b>big</b> <b>belly</b> laughs as she has not done much of that! ...I also would like her to find a man that she is with not just because he is {{attractive}} but someone who can work her out and understand her". [...] Several months after this interview, the character was romantically linked to newcomer and former guest star, general surgical consultant Abra Durant, played by Adrian Edmondson. Edmondson departed from and returned to the show several times, with Kyla and Abra breaking up and reuniting on multiple occasions. Asked in February 2008 whether the two would ever get back together, Ayola responded: [...] "He treated Kyla like dirt, so I don’t know if she’ll forgive him, but I love working with Ade – he’s a gorgeous man." [...] The two ultimately left Holby together, moving to Ghana.|$|E
500|$|Ganesha {{images were}} {{prevalent}} {{in many parts}} of India by the 6th century. The 13th-century statue pictured is typical of Ganesha statuary from 900–1200, after Ganesha had been well-established as an independent deity with his own sect. This example features some of Ganesha's common iconographic elements. A virtually identical statue has been dated between 973–1200 by Paul Martin-Dubost, and another similar statue is dated c.12th century by Pratapaditya Pal. Ganesha has the head of an elephant and a <b>big</b> <b>belly.</b> [...] This statue has four arms, which is common in depictions of Ganesha. He holds his own broken tusk in his lower-right hand and holds a delicacy, which he samples with his trunk, in his lower-left hand. The motif of Ganesha turning his trunk sharply to his left to taste a sweet in his lower-left hand is a particularly archaic feature. A more primitive statue in one of the Ellora Caves with this general form has been dated to the 7th century. [...] Details of the other hands are difficult to make out on the statue shown. In the standard configuration, Ganesha typically holds an axe or a goad in one upper arm and a pasha (noose) in the other upper arm. In rare instances, he may be depicted with a human head.|$|E

60|$|Next morning, {{when the}} thick white fog, {{which made the}} smoking river {{resemble}} Father Rhine in autumn, had been licked up by fiery rays, we embarked, together with Chief Apó, of Asánta, the honest old owner of the 'Ingotro concession.' Our conveyance was the Effuenta, a steam-launch attached to the mine of that name, bought second-hand, and a fine specimen of what launches ought not to be. Built by Messieurs Dickenson, of Birkenhead, she is much too small (36 feet by 8) for a river which, even in {{the depth of the}} dries, averages two fathoms, and rarely runs less than ten feet. The engines are over far from the boiler, and the long raking stern swells out into a <b>big</b> <b>belly</b> worthy of a manatee or a Dutch hoy. Her boiler had been replaced with the usual inconsequence. She had been repaired by an 'intelligent artisan,' Mr. Emery; but, as he was allowed no tools and no time, he contented himself with reporting her in good working order. Consequently after every half-hour we had to unscrew the safety-valve, let off steam, and fill the boiler with a funnel and a tin pot. Pleasant three hours under a thin board-awning, in a broiling sun, off a poisonous mangrove-swamp! Presently she had to be started by the surf-boat lashed to one side, and a large canoe to the other. Finally, after a last breakdown, we saw steam-launch Effuenta lying high and dry upon the beach at Sánmá.|$|E

Every character had their moments-- Amy's giraffe hunting flashback, for one-- which kept the entire half hour from getting bogged down with too much of one thing. I'll remember this one like it was interesting." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste was also positive towards the episode, giving the episode an 8.4/10 rating. He felt that the episode was Futurama having [...] "the most sheer fun it's had" [...] in its sixth season, attributing this to the episode having the entire Planet Express crew prominently featured in the episode, writing: [...] "...with so many personalities abounding, [...] "Mobius Dick" [...] sic didn't {{have to rely on}} just one type of humor.

60|$|On the {{following}} morning Mr. Mollett senior awoke with a racking headache. My belief is, that when men pay this penalty for drinking, they are partly absolved from other penalties. The penalties on drink are various. I mean those which affect the body, exclusive of those which affect the mind. There are great red swollen noses, very disagreeable both to the wearer and his acquaintances; there are morning headaches, awful to be thought of; there are sick stomachs, by which means the offender escapes through a speedy purgatory; there are sallow cheeks, sunken eyes, and shaking shoulders; there are very <b>big</b> <b>bellies,</b> and no bellies at all; and there is delirium tremens.

5000|$|In DC Comics publications, <b>Big</b> <b>Belly</b> Burger {{is said to}} be one of {{the largest}} {{fast-food}} chains in the United States. Founded in Coast City in the 1950s, various stories establish that the chain is now nationwide. <b>Big</b> <b>Belly</b> Burger is well-known in the DC Comics universe for its French fries, milkshakes, and large hamburgers. Its signature menu items include three burgers: the Belly Buster, the Belly Bloater, and the Cheesemeister Deluxe. The <b>Big</b> <b>Belly</b> Burger mascot is a smiling, bearded, red-haired man with glasses (modeled on comic book writer and editor Andy Helfer). The mascot is often depicted holding aloft a plate on which a large hamburger rests. Variations of the mascot also appear, such as a mascot with an upraised arm and no plate. Beginning about 2008, a <b>Big</b> <b>Belly</b> Burger logo began to be depicted in DC Comics. This logo consists of a large red circle with a heavy black border, a smaller white smiley off-center at the top of the red circle, and two three-fingered cartoonish hands (one in the red circle, one opposite the smiley at the top of the red circle). The image looks like a rotund, smiling person patting a fat stomach and giving a thumb's up. <b>Big</b> <b>Belly</b> Burger also has a catchphrase, [...] "It's Belly Belly good" [...] (a play on the words [...] "very very good").
