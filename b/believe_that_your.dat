500|$|Sveinn asked Haraldr {{which of}} his {{possessions}} of his he valued most highly. He answered {{that it was}} his banner (merki), Landøyðan. Thereupon Sveinn asked what virtue it had to be accounted so valuable. Haraldr replied that it was prophesied that victory would be his before whom this banner was borne; and added that this had been the case ever since he had obtained it. Thereupon Sveinn said, [...] "I shall <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> flag has this virtue if you fight three battles with King Magnús, your kinsman, and are victorious in all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{researchers}} believe the hippocampus is only involved in episodic memory and spatial cognition. This then {{raises the question}} where semantic memory may be located. Some believe semantic memory lives in temporal neocortex. Others believe that semantic knowledge is widely distributed across all brain areas. To illustrate this latter view, consider your knowledge of dogs. Researchers holding the 'distributed semantic knowledge' view <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> knowledge of the sound a dog makes exists in your auditory cortex, whilst your ability to recognize and imagine the visual features of a dog resides in your visual cortex. Recent evidence supports {{the idea that the}} temporal pole bilaterally is the convergence zone for unimodal semantic representations into a multimodal representation. [...] These regions are particularly vulnerable to damage in semantic dementia, which is characterised by a global semantic deficit.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] cried Betty. [...] "I {{never thought}} to betray you; sooner would I have died. I <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> father was hurt, and that while you were visiting him that man would take me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Mrs. Hastings; [...] "I {{want you}} to do it. I've reasons for <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> {{influence}} would go further with her than mine. For one thing, I fancy she is feeling rather ashamed of herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is every}} reason to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> {{directors}} acted, as they thought, in your interests, but they have been misled." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Good, we {{will leave}} that and pass on. Have you any reason to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> {{mistress}} was likely to take a sleeping powder last night?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The song [...] "Even If You Win, You're Still a Rat" [...] by Architects {{refers to}} a {{meaningless}} pursuit of money. [...] "Don't slip up, chase that finish line. They don't want you <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> life deserves a meaning." ...|$|R
6000|$|He sat upright--laid on Alda's wrist a long bony burning hand, whose clasp she did {{not forget}} for weeks, and forcing her to look at him, said, 'Did you {{allow it to be}} <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> brother Felix was a gambler?' ...|$|R
5000|$|It is with {{considerable}} diffidence that I attempt {{to address the}} American people, knowing and feeling sensibly my incompetency; and <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> highly and well improved minds would not be well entertained by the address of a Choctaw ... We as Choctaws rather chose to suffer and be free ... George W. Harkins, George W. Harkins to the American People ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{unfortunately}} true. The {{trouble was}} that your brother lives a long way off, and you led me to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> money was running out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But what of that ------ being a patriot? Why not, {{like another}} Curtius, {{jump into the}} gulf, since you <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> country would benefit by your death?" ...|$|E
6000|$|ALICE. 'Take care, Amy, or I shall {{begin to}} <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> father was right. What {{do you think}} would happen if I were to leave you to him!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You seem to {{have been}} {{cultivating}} your powers of observation," [...] Flora told him. [...] "But I'm more disposed to consider the matter from Helen's point of view. As it happens, she's a friend of mine and I've reasons for <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> partner's readily susceptible and inclined to be fickle. Of course, I'm not jealous." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{are many}} {{subjects}} not alluded {{to in this}} message which might with propriety be introduced, but I abstain, <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> patriotism and statesmanship will suggest the topics and the legislation most conducive {{to the interests of}} the whole people.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] his {{companion}} agreed, [...] "I never <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> we should succeed; though, as you had set your heart on it, I {{did not like}} to hang back. But it really did seem to me a wild scheme, altogether. I thought possibly we might get out of the fort, but I <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> plan of getting disguises would break down altogether. The rest seemed comparatively easy.|$|R
6000|$|Britt, {{looking into}} her clear eyes, {{acquired}} a new confidence in her. [...] "Tell me, Miss Lambert, {{do you really}} <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> father comes to you in this way?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You cannot wish me to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> affection {{would not}} have been worth having," [...] said Deronda, finding that she paused as if she {{expected}} him to make some answer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely not," [...] he dissented. [...] "The person {{whom you}} {{saw was a}} gentleman from my suite, who wore the dress of an {{inferior}} mandarin. He is sometimes supposed to resemble me. I should have <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> apprehension of such things would have informed you that no Prince of my line would wear the garments of his order for a public show." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{even more}} eager," [...] Penrose answered. [...] "I have always <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> one {{sure way to}} {{happiness}} lay through your conversion.

As God is my witness, I speak sincerely. Hesitate no longer! Be converted, and be happy." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'll {{teach you}} whether we play Hamlet or not. It's grand fun and will {{straighten}} you up capitally. But I don't <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> was <b>your</b> {{only reason for}} saying 'I'm glad' in that decided way, was it now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The anguish {{that was}} Grizel's then! [...] "You can't think that I told him!" [...] she cried, {{and she held}} out her arms as if to remind him of who she was. [...] "You can <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> of <b>your</b> Grizel?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Harkee, boy: I {{more than}} half <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> drowsy head let in the Siouxes. Be modest in speech, my watchful son, or {{you may have to}} answer yet for the {{mischief}} your own bad conduct has brought upon us." ...|$|E
