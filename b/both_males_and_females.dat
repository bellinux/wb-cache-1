40|$|This {{study is}} a sociolinguistic study about request made by <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> {{employer}} to the <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees <b>and</b> also <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees to <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers. The writer is interested in investigating request since request can be used differently by both employers and employees. She also wants to know the types of request used by the <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employer to the <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees <b>and</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees to <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers. The writer used Ervin-Tripp?s theory of request as the main theory to classify the types of request. To find {{the most frequently used}} types of request used by <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees, the writer used descriptive quantitative approach. The writer found that <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers mostly used the same types of request expressions to <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees. However, the writer found various types of request used by <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees to <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers. The result of this research showed that <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers mostly used bald imperatives as their types of request, <b>both</b> to their <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees. However, <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees used various types of request, <b>both</b> to <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employer. Thus, the result might prove that the social status and gender may have influenced the types of request made by <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees...|$|R

5|$|Contrary {{to initial}} reports of monogamy, ruffed lemurs {{in the wild}} exhibit {{seasonal}} polygamous breeding behavior, with <b>both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> mating {{with more than one}} partner within a single season. Mating is not restricted to just community members, but also involves members of neighboring communities. Females mate primarily with males with whom they had affiliative relations prior to mating season, although some matings occurred with roaming males from other communities.|$|E
5|$|Promiscuity, {{in which}} <b>both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> mate with {{multiple}} partners, also occurs in rodents. In {{species such as}} the white-footed mouse, females give birth to litters with multiple paternities. Promiscuity leads to increased sperm competition and males tend to have larger testicles. In the Cape ground squirrel, the male's testes can be 20 percent of its head-body length. Several rodent species have flexible mating systems that can vary between monogamy, polygyny and promiscuity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> have short, {{straight}} fur that {{is relatively}} dense and without spots or patterns.

5|$|Gregarious animals, {{hartebeest}} form {{herds of}} 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place {{throughout the year}} {{with one or two}} peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. <b>Both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{compulsory}} education period in Malta has been {{between five and}} 16 years of age since {{the introduction of the}} Education Act 1988. This is an increase from up to 12 years of age in 1924 (in this year, school attendance became compulsory for those already enrolled - the act of enrollment itself was not compulsory) and 14 years of age in 1946, when compulsory school attendance was introduced for all students, enrolled or otherwise.

5|$|The olive baboon also {{actively}} hunts prey, {{from small}} rodents and hares to foxes and other primates. Its limit is usually small antelope, such as Thomson's gazelle and also, rarely, sheep, goats, and live chickens, which may amount to 33.5% of its food from hunting. Hunting {{is usually a}} group activity, with <b>both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> participating. Interestingly, this systematic predation was apparently developed recently. In a field study, such behavior was observed as starting with the males of one troop and spreading through all ages and sexes.|$|E

5|$|The species {{lives in}} families, with {{population}} densities of 10 to 12 individuals per hectare. Family feeding territories do not overlap with each other, and mostly {{remain the same}} each year; however, the home territories of different family groups are larger and do overlap with each other. <b>Both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> have been observed to mark corners of stones mostly located {{near the center of}} their home territory, from April to December, by rubbing their neck glands against them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> {{can defend}} the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited {{for this purpose}} due to its stockier, more {{powerful}} build. Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind. Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride. Those lagging behind may provide other valuable services to the group. An alternative hypothesis {{is that there is}} some reward associated with being a leader who fends off intruders, and the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses. The male or males associated with the pride must defend their relationship to the pride from outside males who attempt to take over their relationship with the pride.|$|E
5|$|<b>Both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> utilize {{calls in}} alarm situations, {{especially}} in territorial disputes and encounters with predators. Males alone produce the cheer call, which can sound indistinct. In southern regions of their range, the sound males use in alarm disputes is a ringing pink or p'dink sound. Females {{are the only}} ones that can perform the paired dit-dit or chatter sounds. The former can be used in territorial disputes with predators, and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males cheer chant. The chatter is used exclusively with territorial encounters with male song, and the song can either follow or overlap her mate's song.|$|E

5|$|During the {{reproductive}} season, males {{of this and}} other fairywren species pluck yellow petals, which contrast with their plumage, and show them to female fairywrens. The petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory. Males sometimes show petals to females in other territories even outside the breeding season, presumably to promote themselves. Fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous: pairs will bond for life, though <b>both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> will regularly mate with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting.|$|E
5|$|The addax mainly eats {{grasses and}} leaves of any {{available}} shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes. These animals are well-adapted {{to exist in}} their desert habitat, as they can live without water {{for long periods of}} time. Addax form herds of five to 20 members, consisting of <b>both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females.</b> They are led by the oldest female. Due to its slow movements, the antelope is an easy target for its predators: lions, humans, African wild dogs, cheetahs, and leopards. Breeding season is at its peak during winter and early spring. The natural habitat of the addax are arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts.|$|E
5|$|The main sub-traditions of Jainism have {{historically}} disagreed, with Digambaras (sky-clad, naked mendicant order) stating {{that a woman}} is by her nature and her body unable to practice asceticism, such as by living naked, and therefore she cannot achieve spiritual liberation because of her gender. She can at best, state the Digambara texts, live an ethical life so that she is reborn as {{a man in a}} future life. In this view, she is also viewed a threat to a monk's chastity. In contrast, Svetambaras (white-clad, wear clothes) have interpreted Mahavira's teaching as encouraging <b>both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> to pursue a mendicant ascetic life with the possibility of moksha (kaivalya, spiritual liberation) regardless of gender.|$|E

5|$|Mating in {{hartebeest}} {{takes place}} throughout the year, {{with one or}} two peaks that can be influenced by the availability of food. <b>Both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Reproduction varies by the subspecies and local factors. Mating takes place in the territories defended by a single male, mostly in open areas. The males may fight fiercely for dominance, following which the dominant male smells the female's genitalia, and follows her if she is in oestrus. Sometimes a female in oestrus holds out her tail slightly to signal her receptivity, and the male tries to block the female's way. She may eventually stand still and allow the male to mount her. Copulation is brief and is often repeated, sometimes twice or more in a minute. Any intruder at this time is chased away. In large herds, females often mate with several males.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds are {{socially}} monogamous. The two sexes look alike except that males {{are a little}} larger in size than females. Mutual mate choice is exhibited in northern mockingbirds. <b>Both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> prefer mates that are more aggressive towards intruders, and so exhibit greater parental investment. However, males are more defensive of their nests than females. In a population where male breeding adults outnumber female breeding adults, females have more freedom in choosing their mates. In these cases, these female breeders {{have the option of}} changing mates within a breeding season if the first male does not provide a high level of parental care, which includes feeding and nest defense. High nesting success is associated with highly aggressive males attacking intruders in the territory, and so these males are preferred by females.|$|E
5|$|Scent factors {{heavily into}} lemur reproduction. Scent-marking {{activity}} escalates during the mating season. Pheromones may coordinate reproductive timing for females coming into estrus. Mating {{can be either}} monogamous or promiscuous for <b>both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females,</b> and mating can include individuals from outside the group. Monogamous lemurs include the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) and the mongoose lemur (E. mongoz), although the mongoose lemur has been observed mating outside of its pair bond. Monogamy is most common among nocturnal species, although some exhibit scramble competition, sexual suppression of subordinates, or competitions between males that avoid direct fighting. In mouse lemurs, males utilize sperm plugs, developed enlarged testes during the mating season, and develop size dimorphism (likely due to the enlarged testes). These indicate a mating system known as scramble competition polygyny, where males cannot defend females or the resources that might attract them.|$|E
