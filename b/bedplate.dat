40|$|The {{target of}} this project is to develop and test a local {{composite}} material allowing the material properties of aluminum housing in the bearing area to be harmonized with the thermal expansion behaviour of the drive shaft. By providing the <b>bedplates</b> with infiltrated ceramic hybrid preforms in the bearing area the integral expansion behaviour of the casting could be clearly reduced in comparison with conventional all-aluminum solutions. The efficiency of the composite material has been confirmed in various engine and non-engine tests. The fatigue investigations carried out using Porsche's typical test loads for high-performance engines yielded very successful results. First vehicle tests are going on without any problems. The infiltration of the composite material was done by squeeze casting. With the help of real-time-controlled die-casting machines {{it is possible to}} produce complete <b>bedplates.</b> The new composite materials result in increased tool wear during machining. This project has successfully demonstrated the basic feasibility of a local composite material for use in the crankshaft main bearing area. The producibility and response of the components under series production conditions must be confirmed in subsequent investigations and/or during a series development phase. (orig.)

These were twin-cylinder non-compound horizontal engines with 64 inch cylinders and just 32 inches of stroke, allowing relatively short connecting rods. The crankshaft, of 13.5 inches diameter, was supported in 3 main bearings, each 25 inches long, on a single cast <b>bedplate.</b> Condenser air pumps were provided {{on the opposite side}} from the cylinders. Although rated as 400 nominal horsepower, with 24 psi steam (reflecting the very low marine boiler pressures typical at that time) the engine had shown 1834 ihp.|$|E
50|$|The block uses a <b>bedplate</b> {{featuring}} a perimeter wall with transverse webbings for durability and quiet operation at high engine speeds. The pistons {{are attached to}} fracture-split forged powdered metal connecting rods using semi-floating press-fit pins. A gerotor oil pump is driven directly from the crankshaft {{on the front of}} the engine. A timing belt is used to drive the valvetrain. Early production 2.0 L engines used a hydraulic tensioner to tension the timing belt. 2000 and 2001 engines used a mechanical spring-loaded tensioner that tended to wear out prematurely, causing serious valve and piston damage upon belt failure due to the interference design of the engine. 2002+ engines utilized a different mechanical tensioner. The water pump is driven from the timing belt, with the water pump housing cast partially into the engine block itself.|$|E
50|$|The balance shafts are {{relocated}} {{from the}} cylinder block to oil pan module. The two-piece steel-aluminum oil pan features in-pan integrated oil-pump assembly {{driven by the}} balance shaft with a shorter inverted-tooth chain. Other improvements include inverted-tooth chain driving the camshaft, forged steel crankshaft, cast aluminum <b>bedplate</b> with main bearing cap inserts made of iron, high-pressure fuel rail with rubber-isolated assembly, acoustically shielded plastic cover for the intake manifold, and structurally enhanced aluminum camshaft cover and front cover. These improvements helped reduce noise intensity by 40% compared to the 2.4 L engine and change the noise signature into a higher frequency above 2,000 Hz. The engine also uses a variable-displacement oil pump and an actively controlled thermostat.

Through the use of a nonmetallic containment shell, eddy currents were eliminated, and the pump efficiency was within two points of that of a comparable conventional pump with a mechanical seal. A metallic containment shell was developed for the relatively small number of applications in which the non-metallic shell is not suitable.

The engine has twin balance shafts and specially designed cam cover to improve NVH, while optimized compressor geometry, acoustic resonators and overall air handling help reduce noise by 2 dB. Centrally placed injector allows optimal operation in both stratified and homogeneous charge ignition. Optimized main bearing journal diameter, roller cam followers, and PVD coated piston rings reduce friction. Starting in 2013, the engine began to replace turbocharged 1.6 L Family I Ecotec engine in Opel cars, and in 2014-2015 it will replace naturally aspirated 1.6 L and 1.8 L Family 1 engines in Chevrolet cars.|$|E
5000|$|... 1995 {{model year}} engines had three {{features}} that set {{them apart from}} later engines. The positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system utilized a plastic oil separator box that was vented directly to the block itself; the breather hose and PCV valve hoses attached to the box, and connected to the induction system. Later engines featured a PCV system that was molded to the cylinder head valve cover. The second feature was internal in nature - the crankshaft main bearings were keyed into the <b>bedplate</b> on the right rear of each transverse web. Later model years featured keys machined on the right front of each web. These considerations are important when considering a rebuild or replacement of this engine. The third feature would be a slightly bigger camshaft that was changed on 1996 and up SOHC vehicles due to a rough idle when the air conditioning was on.

It uses an aluminum engine block, die-cast aluminum <b>bedplate,</b> and am aluminum cylinder head. A chain-driven dual overhead camshaft with dual continuous variable cam phasing, employing weight-saving hollow sections and lobes, operates four valves per cylinder with low-friction, hydraulic roller finger followers. The pistons are made from aluminum for reduced reciprocating mass, feature a concave, shallow-bowl profile to facilitate efficient combustion, and are cooled by under-skirt oil spraying. The crankshaft employs four counterweights to minimize mass, and both it and the con-rods are made of forged steel. The engine features multiple improvements to reduce NVH, such as a cam cover made of GRP and fully decoupled from the engine to reduce noise and vibration, while also saving weight compared to aluminum; a composite intake manifold encapsulated in acoustic padding as well as an external plastic shield that both significantly reduce noise emissions; a mechanical crankshaft isolator which reduces radiated noise and torsional vibrations in the accessory drive system; and scissor gears for the timing drive system, incorporating tooth profiles ground with a Low Noise Shifting (LNS) process for optimal noise reduction. More than 150 patented diesel control functions are deployed by the engine's ECU, which was developed in-house by General Motors and jointly engineered in Italy (by GM Powertrain Torino), Germany, and the United States, and will be used in all future GM four-cylinder diesel engines.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{drilling}} {{of the first}} commercially successful oil well by Edwin Drake in 1859, a new industry was born- one that would rapidly demand new technologies for extraction. Initially, the steam engine used for drilling the well was kept in-place to lift the oil to the surface. As the well's production dropped off, the economic feasibility of firing a boiler and maintaining a steam operation at each individual well fell {{far short of the}} income from the well's production (often only a fraction of a barrel per day.) The ideal solution was to install a new gas engine at each well, thus eliminating hours of preparatory work and large quantities of fuel required to steam a boiler for only a few hours of production. High initial cost prevented this in most cases, so it became much more feasible to convert an abundance of existing steam engines to gas engines. The idea of a converted engine is most commonly credited to Dr. Edwin J. Fithian, a Portersville, PA physician with a great interest in mechanics. His 1897 prototype for a 10-horsepower conversion cylinder was turned down by the Oil Well Supply Company of Oil City, PA, so in 1898 Dr. Fithian partnered with John Carruthers and formed the Carruthers-Fithian Clutch Company, with headquarters in Grove City, PA. The [...] "half-breed" [...] concept (as these engines- being half steam engine, half gas engine, were often referred to) was an immediate success, with an oil producer being able to convert a steam engine with a 10HP gas cylinder and clutch for $120.00. Soon after, multiple companies capitalized on the market for conversion cylinders, most producing a simple two-stroke gas cylinder to bolt onto a steam <b>bedplate,</b> thus avoiding patent infringement from Carruthers-Fithian (which by 1899 had formed the Bessemer Gas Engine Company in Grove City.) [...] Other manufacturers produced engines that were purely of an internal-combustion design, and examples of both exist to this day.|$|E
40|$|Volvo Car Corporation uses a new {{generation}} of four cylinder inline engines in their automobiles. The engine family is known as Volvo Engine Architecture and the differences between the different engines are the different power outputs made possible with different engine boosts. The VEA engines utilise a <b>bedplate</b> design for their engines where the main bearing supports are casted into the <b>bedplate.</b> For the high performance engines the main bearing supports need to be sprayed with an aluminium alloy to get a strong bonding with the <b>bedplate.</b> The spraying is, however, expensive and an alternative solution is sought. Four design proposals, which are based on the current design of the main bearing supports, were proposed. These design proposals does not use any of the sprayed aluminium alloy material. Instead they have been designed with the goal of getting a mechanical bonding, instead of the chemical bonding that the aluminium alloy coating provides. The design proposals were evaluated by static simulations and dynamic simulations to investigate the influence on the main bearings in terms of: • radial deformations of the main bearing profiles, • total pressure and asperity contact pressure and • friction losses. The contact behaviour between the <b>bedplate</b> and the main bearing supports, for the different design proposals, at high temperature were also investigated. The results from the simulations were compared to results from earlier work on the sprayed main bearing supports. None of the design proposals generally provided lower friction losses compared to the sprayed main bearing support. The differences in friction loss should also by weighed against the potential cost saving, which is a question for VCC. The sprayed main bearing supports showed in general higher asperity contact pressure compared to the design proposals. Most of the bonding between the <b>bedplate</b> and the main bearing supports occurred on the top surfaces and the sides of the main bearing supports for the different design proposals.

Further particles are distributed over a wide size range. As a result, achieving desired fluidization {{was found to be}} difficult in the drier and that affected quality of the product. Therefore, a detailed study was conducted to understand the fluidizing behaviour of tea particles. Fluidization behaviour of drier-mouth teas from a commonly used drier called TRICCC FBD was studied using six different bedplates having varying opening area percentages and number of perforations. The study was conducted using a pilot scale fluidized bed unit. Desired bubbling phase in tea-bed was observed with three different bedplates: <b>bedplate</b> with perforations of 0. 5 mm wide, opening area percentage of 4 and 2, 217 perforations per square meter, <b>bedplate</b> with perforations of 0. 5 mm wide, opening area percentage of 5 and 2, 779 perforations per square meter and <b>bedplate</b> with perforations of 0. 6 mm wide, opening area percentage of 5 and 2, 269 perforations per square meter. These bedplates could be used in the drier to dry and improve the quality of the teas produced at present. A statistical analysis conducted on the data of bed pressure drop with varying loading rates of teas indicates that desired bubbling phase in tea-bed is achievable using these bedplates.
