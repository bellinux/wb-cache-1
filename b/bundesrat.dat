5|$|The chancellor, Angela Merkel (22 November 2005–present), is {{the head}} of {{government}} and exercises executive power, similar to the role of a Prime Minister in other parliamentary democracies. Federal legislative power is vested in the parliament consisting of the Bundestag (Federal Diet) and <b>Bundesrat</b> (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The Bundestag is elected through direct elections, by proportional representation (mixed-member). The members of the <b>Bundesrat</b> represent the governments of the sixteen federated states and are members of the state cabinets.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the council can only {{be compared with the}} quite unique and unusual {{composition of}} the German upper house, the <b>Bundesrat.</b> Membership of the <b>Bundesrat</b> is limited to members of the governments of the states of Germany and can be recalled by those governments {{in the same manner as}} the EU's Council. They retain their state role while sitting in the <b>Bundesrat</b> and if their term ends when they are recalled by their state governments (who are solely responsible for their appointment) or they cease to sit in their state government. Hence they also are not elected at the same time and the body as a whole cannot be dissolved like most parliaments. As government representatives, members do not vote as individual members but in state blocks, rather than political alignment, to their state governments' agreed line. Each state has unequal voting powers based on population, with an absolute majority required for decisions. Likewise, the presidency rotates equally between members, though each year rather than every six months like in the EU Council. However, unlike the EU's Council, the <b>Bundesrat</b> does not vary its composition depending on the topic being discussed. They both bear similar criticisms, because of the interference, of executives in the legislative process.|$|E
5|$|De Gaulle {{decided that}} France, though {{formally}} remaining a member, {{would no longer}} participate in the NATO military organization. This caused a rift between France and West Germany, which then started to emphasize standardization with American equipment, especially in armament, and to follow the new NATO policy to use multifuel diesel engines. German defence minister Franz Josef Strauss began to oppose the common tank project. In July 1963, the defence committee of the German <b>Bundesrat</b> decided to procure a purely national tank. In response, the same month the French government decided likewise.|$|E
5|$|The 1866 North German Constitution became (with some {{semantic}} adjustments) the 1871 Constitution of the German Empire. With this constitution, the new Germany acquired some democratic features: {{notably the}} Imperial Diet, which—in {{contrast to the}} parliament of Prussia—gave citizens representation {{on the basis of}} elections by direct and equal suffrage of all males who had reached the age of 25. Furthermore, elections were generally free of chicanery, engendering pride in the national parliament. However, legislation required the consent of the <b>Bundesrat,</b> the federal council of deputies from the states, in and over which Prussia had a powerful influence; Prussia could appoint 17 of 58 delegates with only 14 votes needed for a veto. Prussia thus exercised influence in both bodies, with executive power vested in the Prussian King as Kaiser, who appointed the federal chancellor. The chancellor was accountable solely to, and served entirely at the discretion of, the Emperor. Officially, the chancellor functioned as a one-man cabinet and was responsible for the conduct of all state affairs; in practice, the State Secretaries (bureaucratic top officials in charge of such fields as finance, war, foreign affairs, etc.) acted as unofficial portfolio ministers. With the exception of the years 1872–1873 and 1892–1894, the imperial chancellor was always simultaneously the prime minister of the imperial dynasty's hegemonic home-kingdom, Prussia. The Imperial Diet had the power to pass, amend, or reject bills, but it could not initiate legislation. (The power of initiating legislation rested with the chancellor.) The other states retained their own governments, but the military forces of the smaller states came under Prussian control. The militaries of the larger states (such as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Saxony) retained some autonomy, but they underwent major reforms to coordinate with Prussian military principles and came under federal government control in wartime.|$|E
25|$|As {{minister-president}} of Baden-Würrtemberg, he was President of the <b>Bundesrat,</b> {{the representation}} of the states on the federal level, from 1973 to 1974.|$|E
25|$|In his {{capacity}} as Minister-President, Stoiber served as President of the <b>Bundesrat</b> in 1995/96. In 1998, he also succeeded Theo Waigel {{as chairman of}} the CSU.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the Peace of Prague (1866), the German Confederation was dissolved. Prussia annexed Schleswig, Holstein, Frankfurt, Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, and Nassau. Furthermore, Austria had to promise not to {{intervene}} in German affairs. To solidify Prussian hegemony, Prussia forced the 21 states north of the River Main to join it in forming the North German Confederation in 1867. The confederation was governed by a constitution largely drafted by Bismarck. Executive power was vested in a president, an hereditary office of the kings of Prussia, who was assisted by a chancellor responsible only to him. As president of the confederation, Wilhelm appointed Bismarck as chancellor of the confederation. Legislation was the responsibility of the Reichstag, a popularly elected body, and the <b>Bundesrat,</b> an advisory body representing the states. The <b>Bundesrat</b> was, in practice, the stronger chamber. Bismarck was the dominant figure in the new arrangement; as Foreign Minister of Prussia, he instructed the Prussian deputies to the <b>Bundesrat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following his {{election}} as Minister-President in 1990, Schröder {{also became a}} member of the board of the federal SPD. In 1997 and 1998, he served as President of the <b>Bundesrat.</b>|$|E
25|$|In other German {{speaking}} countries, {{the words}} Reich (Austria before 1918) and Bund (Austria since 1918, Switzerland) are used too. An organ named <b>Bundesrat</b> exists {{in all three}} of them: in Switzerland it is the government and in Germany and Austria the house of regional representatives.|$|E
25|$|In November 2008, a bill {{giving the}} Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) more {{authority}} failed when some states abstained from {{the vote in}} the <b>Bundesrat,</b> the legislative representative of the states. Subsequently, Schäuble suggested changing Bundesrat's voting procedures to discount abstention votes from the total. Many politicians of the opposition criticized his proposal, and some called for his resignation.|$|E
25|$|Berlin, {{the capital}} of Germany, is also both a city state {{and one of the}} sixteen Länder or States and is {{represented}} on the same basis as the other Länder in the directly elected Bundestag, in which it has twelve directly elected seats, and the indirectly elected <b>Bundesrat,</b> to which its Senate (or executive) sends four members.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{allegations}} against Filbinger continued at various occasions, e.g. in 1974 when Filbinger as President of the <b>Bundesrat</b> {{spoke at the}} tricennial of the July 20 Plot, or in 1975 during the debate about a nuclear facility at Wyhl. Debaters often twisted or neglected the existing evidence or confused the circumstance, Petzold's anti-Nazi stance in particular, with the actual verdict.|$|E
25|$|In June 2016 the {{governing}} coalition decided about the key points of a tightening {{of the law}} governing sexual offenses (Sexualstrafrecht, literally: law on the punishment of sexual delicts). At July 7, 2016 the Bundestag passed the resolution and by autumn 2016 the draft bill {{will be presented to}} the second chamber, the <b>Bundesrat.</b> By this change, sexual harassment shall become punishable under the Sexualstrafrecht.|$|E
25|$|After {{the federal}} {{elections}} of 1994 Kohl was reelected with a somewhat reduced majority, defeating Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Rudolf Scharping. The SPD {{was able to}} win {{a majority in the}} <b>Bundesrat,</b> which significantly limited Kohl's power. In foreign politics, Kohl was more successful, for instance getting Frankfurt am Main as the seat for the European Central Bank. In 1997, Kohl received the Vision for Europe Award for his efforts in the unification of Europe.|$|E
25|$|On 12 December 2012, {{following}} {{a series of}} hearings and consultations, the Bundestag adopted the proposed law explicitly permitting non-therapeutic circumcision to be performed under certain conditions; it is now §1631(d) in the German Civil Code. The vote tally was 434 ayes, 100 noes, and 46 abstentions. Following approval by the <b>Bundesrat</b> and signing by the Bundespräsident, the new law became effective on 28 December 2012 a day after its publication in the Federal Gazette.|$|E
25|$|Hans Karl Filbinger (15 September 1913 – 1 April 2007) was a {{conservative}} German politician {{and a leading}} member of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union in the 1960s and 1970s, serving as the first chairman of the CDU Baden-Württemberg and {{vice chairman of the}} federal CDU. He was Minister President of Baden-Württemberg from 1966 to 1978 and as such also chaired the <b>Bundesrat</b> in 1973/74. He founded the conservative think tank Studienzentrum Weikersheim, which he chaired until 1997.|$|E
25|$|Before 2010, {{the usage}} of PGD was in a legal grey area. In 2010, the Federal Court of Justice of Germany ruled that PGD {{can be used in}} {{exceptional}} cases. On 7 July 2011, the Bundestag passed a law that allows PGD in certain cases. The procedure may only be used when there is a strong likelihood that parents will pass on a genetic disease, or when there is a high genetic chance of a stillbirth or miscarriage. On 1 February 2013, the <b>Bundesrat</b> approved a rule regulating how PGD can be used in practice.|$|E
25|$|During {{the years}} of West Berlin's isolation—176 {{kilometers}} (110mi.) inside East Germany—the Western Allies encouraged a close relationship between the Government of West Berlin and that of West Germany. Representatives of the city participated as non-voting members in the West German Parliament; appropriate West German agencies, such as the supreme administrative court, had their permanent seats in the city; and the governing mayor of West Berlin took his turn as President of the <b>Bundesrat.</b> In addition, the Allies carefully consulted with the West German and West Berlin Governments on foreign policy questions involving unification {{and the status of}} Berlin.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of a {{decision}} of the mediation committee of the Bundestag and the <b>Bundesrat,</b> the provision of federal funds for the route were significantly reduced in December 2003. According to the Federal Government's investment plan for the transport infrastructure, €741.4million was allocated to the project in the period 2006–2010. The funding requirement that is in excess of the €3.641billion of federal funds as of 2011 is to be provided by Deutsche Bahn's own funds and third parties. The state of Thuringia is investing a total of €240million from the European Regional Fund in the two high-speed line projects (Nuremberg–Erfurt and Erfurt–Leipzig/Halle).|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} of the {{air transport}} service of the Swiss Air Force are stationed at Bern Airport. These are two jets and two turboprops. The former ones are mainly used for VIP transport and particularly the transport {{of members of the}} <b>Bundesrat.</b> They are also used for other purposes, for example deportations or to support international peacekeeping measures. The two turboprop DHC-6 Twin Otter and Beechcraft King Air are not usually used for VIP flights, but for the passenger transport {{as well as for the}} country's topography service. The Beechcraft 1900 is also used by the country's topography service for the same tasks. The two jets are a Dassault Falcon 900 and a Cessna Citation Excel, which offer up to seats for VIPs.|$|E
25|$|Bismarck acted {{immediately}} {{to secure the}} unification of Germany. He negotiated {{with representatives of the}} southern German states, offering special concessions if they agreed to unification. The negotiations succeeded; patriotic sentiment overwhelmed what opposition remained. While the war was in its final phase, Wilhelm I of Prussia was proclaimed German Emperor on 18 January 1871 in the Hall of Mirrors in the Château de Versailles. The new German Empire was a federation: each of its 25 constituent states (kingdoms, grand duchies, duchies, principalities, and free cities) retained some autonomy. The King of Prussia, as German Emperor, was not sovereign over the entirety of Germany; he was only primus inter pares, or first among equals. However, he held the presidency of the <b>Bundesrat,</b> which met to discuss policy presented by the Chancellor, whom the emperor appointed.|$|E
25|$|After the Kohl Government was {{defeated}} at the 1998 election, Merkel was appointed Secretary-General of the CDU, a key {{position as the}} party was no longer {{part of the federal}} government. Merkel oversaw a string of CDU election victories in six out of seven state elections in 1999, breaking the long-standing SPD-Green hold on the <b>Bundesrat.</b> Following a party funding scandal that compromised many leading figures of the CDU — including Kohl himself and his successor as CDU Leader, Wolfgang Schäuble — Merkel criticised her former mentor publicly and advocated a fresh start for the party without him. She was subsequently elected to replace Schäuble, becoming the first female leader of a German party on 10 April 2000. Her election surprised many observers, as her personality offered a contrast to the party she had been elected to lead; Merkel is a centrist Protestant originating from predominantly Protestant northern Germany, while the CDU is a male-dominated, socially conservative party with strongholds in western and southern Germany, and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, has deep Catholic roots.|$|E

2500|$|Johannes Rau ( [...] ; 16 January 193127 January 2006) was a German {{politician}} of the SPD. He was President of Germany from 1 July 1999 until 30 June 2004, Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia from 20 September 1978 to 9 June 1998 and President of the <b>Bundesrat</b> from 1982-83.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} explains some of {{the process}} prior to the final legislation. [...] On 8December 2015 the government released its proposals for reform. [...] On 8June 2016 the Federal Cabinet (Bundeskabinett) cleared the draft EEG (2016) bill. [...] That bill will now go to the Bundestag and <b>Bundesrat</b> for consideration.|$|E
2500|$|Government redress {{was promised}} {{after years of}} public reparation, a proper {{rehabilitation}} and an apology by the Federal Council (<b>Bundesrat),</b> however not so far, and there only [...] "emergency" [...] payments were made at a ridiculously low level of each several thousand Swiss Francs to the meanwhile old-aged surviving victims of Kinder der Landstrasse.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 September 1886, the Swiss Federal Council {{granted the}} banking house Masson, Chavannes & Co. in Lausanne and the Basler Handelsbank an initial concession. The {{original}} request {{was for a}} [...] narrow gauge railway from Visp to Zermatt, using a mixture of adhesion and rack railway line. At the insistence of the <b>Bundesrat,</b> the gauge was finally altered to metre gauge. The railway was at the outset to be operated {{from the start of}} June to the end of September, as the promoters did not wish to take on the risks of operating the line in an alpine winter. Additionally, it was only in summer that there were prospects of significant numbers of passengers, as in those days winter tourism was still of no great importance. Nevertheless, the <b>Bundesrat</b> reserved the right to extend the operating season, and similarly stipulated that concessionary fares be offered to locals.|$|E
2500|$|The Nationalrat is the {{dominant}} chamber {{in the formation of}} legislation in Austria. However, the upper house of parliament, the <b>Bundesrat,</b> has a limited right of veto (the Nationalrat can—in almost all cases—ultimately pass the respective bill by voting a second time. This is referred to as Beharrungsbeschluss, lit. [...] "vote of persistence"). A convention, called the [...] was convened on 30 June 2003 to decide upon suggestions to reform the constitution, but failed to produce a proposal that would receive the two-thirds of votes in the Nationalrat necessary for constitutional amendments and/or reform.|$|E
2500|$|Prussia {{had only}} a {{plurality}} (17 out of 43 seats) in the <b>Bundesrat</b> despite being larger than the other 21 states combined, but Bismarck could easily control the proceedings through alliances with the smaller states. This began what historians refer to as [...] "The Misery of Austria" [...] in which Austria served as a mere vassal to the superior Germany, a relationship that was to shape history {{until the end of}} the First World War. Bismarck had originally managed to convince smaller states like Saxony, Hesse-Kassel, and Hanover to join with Prussia against Austria, after promising them protection from foreign invasion and fair commercial laws.|$|E
2500|$|Berlin is {{the capital}} of the Federal Republic of Germany. The President of Germany, whose {{functions}} are mainly ceremonial under the German constitution, has their official residence in Bellevue Palace. Berlin is the seat of the German executive, housed in the Chancellery, the Bundeskanzleramt. Facing the Chancellery is the Bundestag, the German Parliament, housed in the renovated Reichstag building since the government's relocation to Berlin in 1998. The <b>Bundesrat</b> ("federal council", performing the function of an upper house) is the representation of the Federal States (Bundesländer) of Germany and has its seat at the former Prussian House of Lords. The total annual federal budget managed by the German government exceeded [...] €310 ($375) billion in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Rau twice {{served as}} President of the <b>Bundesrat</b> in 1982 and 1983 and 1994 and 1995 and thus deputised for the Federal President. In 1998, Rau {{stepped down from}} his {{positions}} as SPD Chairman and Minister President, and on 23 May 1999, he was elected Federal President by the Federal Assembly of Germany to succeed Roman Herzog (CDU). On 1 July 2004, he was succeeded by Horst Köhler. As all Federal Presidents but his mentor Heinemann, who had not wished to be seen off in this manner, Rau was honored by a Großer Zapfenstreich which on his wish included the hymn [...] "Jesus bleibet meine Freude" [...] (Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring).|$|E
2500|$|But {{several other}} state leaders of SPD have started {{flirting with the}} [...] "Left" [...] and today {{there is a huge}} {{struggle}} in the SPD on how to treat the Left in order to gain <b>Bundesrat</b> seats to be once again a true national party. In November 2008, the SPD was at 25% in national opinion polls, one of the lowest values in recent memory. Furthermore, today in the SPD there is rift between two internal factions of the party. One side of the party - the right-wing Seeheimer Kreis refuses to do coalitions with the Left Party. Members of the right-wing include Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Gerhard Schröder. The other side of the party - the political left of the SPD - embraces coalitions with the radical Left. Members include Andrea Ypsilanti and Andrea Nahles.|$|E
2500|$|From 3 October 1957 to 1966, Willy Brandt was Governing Mayor of Berlin, {{during a}} period of {{increasing}} tension in East-West relations that led to the construction of the Berlin Wall. In Brandt's first year as mayor, he also served {{as the president of the}} <b>Bundesrat</b> in Bonn. Brandt was outspoken against the Soviet repression of the Hungarian Uprising in 1956 and against Nikita Khrushchev's 1958 proposal that Berlin receive the status of a [...] "free city". He was supported by the influential publisher Axel Springer. As mayor of West Berlin, Brandt accomplished much in the way of urban development. New hotels, office-blocks and flats were constructed, while both Schloss Charlottenburg and the Reichstag building were restored. Sections of the [...] "Stadtring" [...] Bundesautobahn 100 inner city motorway were opened, while a major housing programme was carried out, with roughly 20,000 new dwellings built each year during his time in office.|$|E
50|$|In Germany, the President of the <b>Bundesrat</b> or President of the Federal Council (German: Bundesratspräsident) is the {{chairperson}} or {{speaker of the}} <b>Bundesrat</b> (Federal Council). He or she is elected by the <b>Bundesrat</b> for a term of one year (usually from November 1 to October 31 in the next year). Traditionally, the Presidency of the <b>Bundesrat</b> rotates among the heads of government (most of them holding the title Minister President) {{of each of the}} states (in German, Länder). As well as acting as a chairperson the President of the <b>Bundesrat</b> acts in place of the President of Germany, if the latter is unable to perform his duties, dies or resigns.|$|E
