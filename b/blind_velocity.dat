50|$|The <b>blind</b> <b>velocity</b> for a {{specific}} pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is an integer multiple of the following, which causes the signal to have zero doppler.|$|E
50|$|Scalloping {{happens in}} a two PRF {{detection}} scenario when target velocity produces a <b>blind</b> <b>velocity</b> for one PRF while the target is at the blind range of the other PRF.|$|E
50|$|A <b>blind</b> <b>velocity</b> {{occurs when}} Doppler {{frequency}} falls {{close to the}} PRF. This folds the return signal into the same filter as stationary clutter reflections. Rapidly alternating different PRF while scanning eliminates blind frequencies.|$|E
50|$|Moving Target Indication (MTI) {{can reduce}} clutter by about 35dB. This allows objects {{as small as}} 1,000 sq ft to be detected. Prevailing wind and weather can degrade MTI performance, and MTI {{introduces}} <b>blind</b> <b>velocities.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{secondary}} {{influence is}} that phase rotation is induced by Doppler, and that creates <b>blind</b> <b>velocities.</b> For example, an object moving at 75 m/s (170 mile/hour) will produce 180 degree phase shift each 1 millisecond at L band.|$|R
50|$|MTI {{requires}} 3 or 4 pulses {{to reduce}} the effect of <b>blind</b> <b>velocities.</b> Multi-pulse strategies use staggered pulses with irregular pulse repetition intervals to prevent signal cancellation on moving objects. The summation process is slightly different so as to accommodate the additional samples.|$|R
50|$|Scalloping for pulse-Doppler radar {{involves}} blind velocities {{created by}} the clutter rejection filter. A two PRF detection schemes will have detection gaps with a pattern of discrete ranges, {{each of which has}} a <b>blind</b> <b>velocity.</b>|$|E
50|$|Moving target {{indicator}} (MTI) radar {{reduces the}} impact of <b>blind</b> <b>velocity</b> by using redundant detectors that introduce a compensating reverse phase shift undoes the phase shift caused by Doppler from reflector motion. This is also improved by using 3 or more pulses with staggering pulse intervals.|$|E
50|$|Scalloping for pulse-Doppler radar {{involves}} blind velocities {{created by}} the clutter rejection filter. Every volume of space must be scanned using 3 or more different PRF. A two PRF detection scheme will have detection gaps with a pattern of discrete ranges, {{each of which has}} a <b>blind</b> <b>velocity.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Pulse-Doppler {{ambiguity}} zones. Each blue zone with no label {{represents a}} velocity/range combination {{that will be}} folded into the unambiguous zone. Areas outside the blue zones are blind ranges and <b>blind</b> <b>velocities,</b> which are filled in using multiple PRF and frequency agility.|$|R
50|$|Each {{individual}} PRF has blind ranges, {{where the}} transmitter pulse {{occurs at the}} same time as the target reflection signal arrives back at the radar. Each individual PRF has <b>blind</b> <b>velocities</b> where the velocity of the aircraft will appear stationary. This causes scalloping, where the radar can be blind for some combinations of speed and distance.|$|R
50|$|Moving target {{indication}} (MTI) is used {{to improve}} the low-elevation limit. MTI creates <b>blind</b> <b>velocities</b> associated with radar scalloping. This reduces radar sensitivity at certain radial velocities, but MTI allows the main lobe of the antenna beam to be aimed closer to the ground. Wind speed above about 5 mile/hour moves debris fast enough to create excessive clutter load, which eliminates most of the MTI improvement.|$|R
40|$|A new {{mathematical}} model is presented which describes the image {{produced by a}} focal plane shutter-equipped camera. The model {{is based upon the}} well-known collinearity condition equations and incorporates both the translational and rotational motion of the camera during the exposure interval. The first differentials of the model with respect to exposure interval, delta t, yield the general matrix expressions for image velocities which may be simplified to known cases. The exposure interval, delta t, may be replaced under certain circumstances with a function incorporating <b>blind</b> <b>velocity</b> and image position if desired. The model is tested using simulated Lunar Orbiter data and found to be computationally stable as well as providing excellent results, provided that some external information is available on the velocity parameters...|$|E
40|$|Since 2003, {{a special}} scan-MTI mode has been {{implemented}} in the PAMIR system and experimentally tested. This mode enables to observe large regions of the earth due to the scan operation of the antenna. To improve the moving target detection performance, radar bursts are transmitted in five different frequency bands, which allows to avoid <b>blind</b> <b>velocities,</b> to resolve velocity ambiguities and to increase the probability of target detection.|$|R
40|$|The {{airborne}} experimental multi-channel SAR/GMTI system PAMIR, {{which is}} developed at FGAN-FHR, is a multifunctional radar system that offers high-resolution imaging (SAR, ISAR, IfSAR) and powerful GMTI capabilities. One {{of the main}} applications of PAMIR is the demonstration of wide area surveillance for moving targets. This task is realized by its special scan-MTI mode. This mode enables to observe large regions of the earth with wide swath due to the scanning operation of the antenna. Moreover it solves the problems caused by a Doppler ambiguous operation (i. e. <b>blind</b> <b>velocities</b> and ambiguities of the moving target velocity estimation) {{by taking advantage of}} the large bandwidth of the imaging system. This paper presents the scan-MTI mode of PAMIR and some experimental results, which were obtained with this mode...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 30 - 31) The Moving Target Indicator (MTI) {{technique is}} one of the most important signal-processing devices for improving signal-to-clutter ratio in present day radar systems. The MTI makes use of the fact that echo signals from moving targets are doppler-shifted in frequency relative to those from stationary or very slowly moving targets (clutter). The basic principle is to delay (or store) the echoes from one transmitted pulse for exactly one pulse period and then subtract from those values the values obtained during the next transmitted pulse. This delay-and-subtract circuitry is called the canceller. However, some conditions hinder the performance of the MTI and have to be overcomed. In this project three of these conditions: <b>blind</b> <b>velocities,</b> weighting constants, and second-time-around returns are analyzed. Design of a digital MTI canceller using random access memory is then developed using the knowledge gained through this analysis...|$|R
40|$|The RCAF {{considers}} chaff {{to be one}} of {{the main}} threats in an air attack because of the presentation of a large number of false alarms to a PPI operator or to the automatic data transmission equipment (the AN/FST- 2). Normally, MTI is not effective because the radial velocity of the chaff lies outside the <b>blind</b> speeds (<b>velocity</b> notches). In a fully coherent radar, such as the NA/FPS- 508, it is a simple matter to fit a variable-frequency oscillator to shift the velocity notches to cover the chaff's velocity. The design and evaluation of a Variable Velocity Notch Moving Target Indication (VVNMTI) system is described. A more sophisticated design is proposed which will reduce the number of true targets lost owing to the velocity notches. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|In Microscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (μPIV), {{velocity}} {{fields in}} microchannels are sampled over finite volumes {{within which the}} velocity fields themselves may vary significantly. In the past, this has limited measurements often to be only qualitative in nature, <b>blind</b> to <b>velocity</b> magnitudes. In the pursuit of quantitatively useful results, one has treated {{the effects of the}} finite volume as errors that must be corrected by means of ever more complicated processing techniques. Resulting measurements have limited robustness and require convoluted efforts to understand measurement uncertainties. To increase the simplicity and utility of μPIV measurements, we introduce a straightforward method, based directly on measurement, by which one can determine {{the size and shape of}} the volume over which moving fluids are sampled. By comparing measurements with simulation, we verify that this method enables quantitative measurement of velocity profiles across entire channels, as well as an understanding of experimental uncertainties. We show how the method permits measurement of an unknown flow rate through a channel of known geometry. We demonstrate the method to be robust against common sources of experimental uncertainty. We also apply the theory to model the technique of Scanning μPIV, which is often used to locate the center of a channel, and we show how and why it can in fact misidentify the center. The results have general implications for research and development that requires reliable, quantitative measurement of fluid flow on the micrometer scale and below.

5000|$|The QUEEN {{has been}} graciously pleased {{to approve the}} award of the George Cross to the undermentioned:-24092380 Warrant Officer Class 1 Barry JOHNSON, Royal Army Ordnance Corps.WO1 B. Johnson, R.A.O.C. serving as an E.O.D. {{operator}} in N. Ireland completed 25 E.O.D. tasks, including the safe neutralization of 9 live devices. The most significant incident occurred when W.O.1 Johnson was tasked to a vehicle which, it was suspected, contained mortars designed to be fired at a nearby Security Forces base. The vehicle had been abandoned {{in the middle of}} a housing estate and beside a hospital.WO1 Johnson immediately realized that civilian lives would be put at risk if any of the mortar bombs were inadvertently launched during his disposal action. The normal procedure would have been to deal with the mortars by using a remotely controlled vehicle to disrupt the device. He decided that this posed too great a risk to civilian lives and that he would have to remove the bombs from their firing tubes and dismantle them by hand.With the help of his assistant, the firing tubes were carefully moved from the back of the vehicle and placed on the ground. As the next stage was extremely hazardous, due to the delicate nature of the bombs, WO1 Johnson sent his assistant back behind cover and continued the render-safe procedure alone. He placed the firing tubes so that if they fired or exploded, the patients in the hospital would not have been in danger. In the dark, and in a bitterly cold drizzle, which made the handling of metal objects more hazardous, he proceeded to remove the bombs, dismantling each in turn. While he was dismantling the last bomb, there was an explosion, causing him very serious injury to his face, eyes and legs. Completely <b>blinded</b> by high <b>velocity</b> fragments, he was thrown across the road by the force of the blast, suffering multiple injuries to his legs. Such was his courage and determination to ensure that the task was completed safely that, although in great pain, he refused to be evacuated until he had carefully briefed his assistant on the precise details of the device so that the operation could be safely completed by a replacement operator.|$|R
