5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella {{is a prime}} example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference between gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E

5|$|After {{breaking}} from Gardner's Bricket Wood coven, Valiente formed her own coven with Grove as High Priest, {{still following}} {{the tradition of}} Gardnerian Wicca, albeit without the Wiccan laws, which she believed to be entirely an invention of Gardner's. This coven however failed to last, breaking up amid arguments between its founders. In 1956, Valiente, {{along with her husband}} and her mother, moved into a basement flat in Lewes Crescent, Kemptown, in the southern coastal town of Brighton, although in 1968 they moved into a flat nearer to the town centre. She befriended another Kemptown resident, the journalist Leslie Roberts, who shared her interest in the supernatural. He attracted much attention to himself in the local press through his claims that practitioners of black magic were also operating in the area. Valiente remained a good friend to Roberts until his death from heart disease in 1966. She also got <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with Gardner, and mended their friendship, remaining on good terms until his death in 1964, when he left her £200 in his will. During the early 1960s she also developed a correspondence with two Gardnerian initiates in Sheffield, Patricia Crowther and her husband Arnold Crowther, finally meeting them when the latter couple visited Brighton in 1965.|$|E

In the third quarter, the Tigers stormed <b>back,</b> keeping <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with the Blue Eagles. In the dying minutes of the fourth quarter, rookie sensation Jervy Cruz fouled out with 1:16 left; Evangelista, the almost-hero of Game 1, fouled out two minutes earlier. With a 64-59 Ateneo lead, Anthony Espiritu scored a three-pointer on the UST offense. Mark Canlas scored a put-back to tie the game. Intal missed a short jumper at the other end for force overtime.|$|R

25|$|Back in England, Hazlitt again {{travelled}} up {{into the}} country, having obtained several commissions to paint portraits. One commission again proved fortunate, as it brought him <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with Coleridge and Wordsworth, both of whose portraits he painted, {{as well as one}} of Coleridge's son Hartley. Hazlitt aimed to create the best pictures he could, whether they flattered their subjects or not, and neither poet was satisfied with his result, though Wordsworth and their mutual friend Robert Southey considered his portrait of Coleridge a better likeness than one by the celebrated James Northcote.|$|E

5000|$|Touch of Class was foaled in on April 27, 1973, and {{was first}} {{registered}} as Stillaspill with the Jockey Club, having a brief racing career before being {{trained as a}} show-jumper. [...] In 1981, in her first year at the Grand Prix level, she won classes at several shows, and in 1982 she qualified with Fargis for the USET's team for the World Championships in Dublin.

Jandali states that after {{finishing}} his PhD he returned to Syria to work and that it was during this period that Schieble left him (they divorced in 1962). He also states that after the divorce he lost contact with Mona for a period of time: I also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old, as her mother divorced me when I went to Syria, but we got <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> after 10 years. We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didn't know where she was, but since 10 years ago we've been in constant contact, and I see her three times a year. I organized a trip for her last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and she went with a relative from Florida. A few years later, Schieble married an ice skating teacher, George Simpson. Mona Jandali took her stepfather's last name thus became Mona Simpson. In 1970, after they divorced, Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her on her own.|$|E
25|$|Phil {{decides to}} sell The Queen Victoria in revenge for manager Alfie Moon's (Shane Richie) bad {{treatment}} of Roxy. He sells it to Mick Carter (Danny Dyer), not realising that Mick is Shirley's younger brother. Lola reveals {{that she is}} in a relationship with Ian's son Peter Beale (Ben Hardy), and tells Phil that he cannot see Lexi if he objects. Phil threatens Ian, forcing him to object to the relationship instead. Phil repairs his fractured relationship with Sharon and they have sex. Sharon resumes her relationship with Phil and moves in with him. Together they buy 10 Turpin Road and convert it into a new bar, which Sharon names 'The Albert'. When Ian's daughter Lucy dies, Phil begins supporting his former enemy and helps him get back on his feet. Witnessing Ian's grief prompts Phil to try to get <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with Ben, but he is stunned when Ritchie tells him that Ben has already been released from prison. Phil starts to track down by Ben, but is convinced by Jay and Sharon that Ben will return when he is ready. Phil is stunned when he realises that Mick is in fact Shirley's son, who she had at fourteen, subsequently raised by Shirley's parents as their son, without Mick ever discovering the truth. Phil then agrees to be her confidant for the secret in exchange for money, which Shirley steals from her son Dean Wicks' (Matt Di Angelo) salon, although Dean caught her doing this.|$|E

Later that month, Bell talked about some of the new character pairings in the season, saying [...] "Putting Mack and Daisy together; putting Hunter and May together; putting Bobbi and Fitz together—suddenly you have all these different dynamics, all these different stories that you didn't have before." [...] Tancharoen later highlighted the number of characters in the season compared to previous, stating that [...] "There's more scale and scope, but at the same time, I think we're diving into each character's internal struggle a little bit more." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 1974, Kennedy {{was sold}} to Liverpool for a club record £200,000. Manager Bill Shankly {{resigned}} {{on the same day}} as the transfer was made, though had admired Kennedy for years and stated that [...] "maybe it will be said that one of the last things I did at this club was to sign a great new player". Shortly after the move Kennedy got <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with his estranged wife, and the pair began living together in Ainsdale. New manager Bob Paisley handed Kennedy his debut in place of John Toshack against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 31 August 1974, and it took Kennedy just 22 minutes to open his goalscoring account as the Reds went on to record a comfortable 3–0 win. Liverpool ended the 1974–75 season as runners-up to Derby County in the league. Kennedy featured just 25 times in the league as Toshack formed an effective combination with Kevin Keegan up front, and started to become frustrated and disillusioned in the club.|$|E
500|$|According to Giselle Benatar of Entertainment Weekly, {{there are}} two {{versions}} of how Madonna {{came up with the}} idea for the book. One was that she conceived the idea of an erotic photography book during the shooting of the film A League of Their Own in the summer of 1991. The second one is that Judith Regan, vice-president and editor-in-chief of Simon & Schuster, flew to Los Angeles in March 1991 to meet with Madonna and her manager Freddy DeMann, armed with a proposal for a similar collection of photo-erotica. The singer had initially verified whether Regan had approached any other celebrities with this concept, as Madonna would be interested to be a part of it only if it was a unique idea. By the end of the meeting Madonna had agreed [...] "in principle" [...] to do a book called Madonna's Book of Erotica and Sexual Fantasies. She told Regan that DeMann would call her and work out the details regarding the book. However, Madonna never got <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with Regan, who assumed that the singer did not want to proceed with the idea. Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg never confirmed nor denied Regan's claim, but according to Benatar, Madonna started working on Sex before wrapping up A League of Their Own. At first Warner Bros. Records and the executive directors at Time Warner were reluctant to allow Madonna to publish such a book, but finally gave in to the idea. Madonna, however, was forced to sign a contract that forbade her from showing child pornography, bestiality and religious imagery. Not long after signing this agreement Madonna founded Maverick, a multi-media entertainment company. Since by contract she had total artistic control over any of the work released by Maverick, the agreement she signed with Time Warner concerning what not to do in Sex became obsolete.|$|E
500|$|Scholars such as Catherine Rottenberg {{examine how}} Larsen’s {{characters}} struggle against {{race and gender}} norms of [...] "whiteness" [...] in the United States. Rottenberg shows how the main characters in the novel confront normative characteristics of white culture. Clare, who is of mixed race, choses {{to identify with the}} white culture. Irene, who identifies as an African American, choses to pass when she feels the need to blend into white culture. The essence of Rottenberg's scholarship shows how the novel's characters struggle against the desire for whiteness because of the positive stereotypes society has created around [...] "white" [...] identity. Clare's experience growing up with her white aunts, who treated her as a servant, directly impacts Clare's initial desire towards whiteness. Hence, she passes as a white woman, marries a white man, and forgets her African American culture. Even though as a society the white race is the desirable race, Rottenberg explains how there are limitations put into place so the inferior race can never fully be white. [...] For example, Clare has this desire to pass as a white woman because she believes that is the only way she will have a social power, but after reconnecting with her childhood friend Irene, she begins to struggle with her misplaced desire for whiteness and returns to her African American identification. Seeing Irene sparks a desire in Clare to get <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with her African American culture. Similarly, Irene identifies as black, but because she desires to feel safe and in control at all times in her life , she chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene's desire to be white comes from her wanting the middle-class lifestyle because it will give her the security she needs. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation, which in a way, makes her feel like her marriage and the life she knows at risk. Throughout Larsen's novel Rottenberg explains how Clare has evolved from wanting to achieve whiteness to reconnecting with the African American culture, while Irene still has a desire to achieve [...] "whiteness" [...] for the feel secure.|$|E

5000|$|The comedy {{gradually}} {{shifted to}} observation, {{with a less}} strong emphasis on a narrative. The playlet [...] "Look <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> Hunger" [...] (spoofing John Osborne's Look <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> Anger) in the episode [...] "The East Cheam Drama Festival" [...] from the fifth series, showed that writers Galton and Simpson were <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with developments <b>in</b> the British theatre, {{in the use of}} sighs and silent pauses, something Osborne's style had in common with the plays of Harold Pinter, whose work began to emerge {{towards the end of the}} series' run. In addition, the measured pacing of the episodes was unusual in an era of fast-talking radio comedians, such as Ted Ray, who typically used a machine-gun style of delivery to fill every single second of airtime.|$|R
