2500|$|Weinrich et al. (1993) and Weinberg et al. (1994) {{criticized the}} scale for lumping {{individuals}} who are different based on different dimensions of sexuality into the same categories. [...] When applying the scale, Kinsey considered two dimensions of sexual orientation: overt sexual experience and psychosexual reactions. Valuable information was lost by collapsing the two values into one final score. A person who has only predominantly same sex reactions is different from someone with relatively little reaction <b>but</b> <b>lots</b> of same sex experience. It would have been quite simple for Kinsey to have measured the two dimensions separately and report scores independently to avoid loss of information. Furthermore, {{there are more than}} two dimensions of sexuality to be considered. Beyond behavior and reactions, one could also assess attraction, identification, lifestyle etc. This is addressed by the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid.|$|E

2500|$|Distress is a {{prevalent}} {{and costly}} problem in today's workplace. About one-third of workers report {{high levels of}} stress. 20-30% of workers in different sectors of the European Union reported in 2007 that they believed work-related stress was potentially affecting their health. Three-quarters of employees believe the worker has more on-the-job stress than a generation ago. In Great Britain, a sixth of the workforce experiences occupational stress every year. Evidence also suggests that distress is the major cause of turnover in organizations. With continued distress at the workplace, workers will develop psychological and physiological dysfunctions and decreased motivation in excelling in their position. [...] Increased levels of job stress {{are determined by the}} awareness of having little control <b>but</b> <b>lots</b> of demands in the work area. Occupational stress and its sequelae represent the majority of work-related illnesses causing missed work days. Those in the protective services, transportation and materials moving, building grounds cleaning and maintenance, and healthcare are more susceptible to both work injuries and illnesses, as well as work-related stress.|$|E
2500|$|According to the EastEnders Handbook by Hilary Kingsley, casting babies for {{roles in}} EastEnders is usually done locally, so that {{children}} and their parents do not have to travel far when they are called into the studios at BBC Elstree. Because of the strict laws dictating the number of hours babies are permitted to work, occasionally dolls or understudies have to be used if the child runs out of time. This occurred with Steven’s original actor, Edward Farrell, in 1990. The baby had been scripted to appear at a Guy Fawkes Night party; however, actress Michelle Collins, who played his screen mother Cindy, has since revealed that they used another baby for those scenes: [...] "Not only was she a girl, she also had bright red hair whereas Edward was fair. I had to keep pushing her hair back under her hat <b>but</b> <b>lots</b> of [...] still spotted it". Young Farrell was also the reason viewers never saw Cindy wearing her red wedding dress on-screen again following its next outing at Steven’s christening in February 1990. It was a dress that Michelle Collins particularly disliked. She has commented, [...] "When Edward was sick over it, I knew it wouldn’t recover and I kissed him for it." ...|$|E

Honey-B commented to an interviewer at Arama! Japan by stating, [...] "We {{leave it to the}} listeners to decide about the message or feel of this track, but as for FEMM, they’re singing about “girl power”. Itʼs okay to be sexy, just donʼt let them take advantage of you. [...] "Fxxk Boyz Get Money" [...] has very aggressive lyrics, <b>but</b> <b>lots</b> of women seem to relate to it. They call it their life anthem." [...] For their first extended play Astroboy, both members did not yet have any professional experience in singing. The duo stated that the first time recording and appearing in a music video as their agents was challenging. FEMM expressed that they would be honored to collaborate with any producers and songwriters who understand their message. Molly Osberg from Vice noted that FEMM combined Japanese fashion and music together. She commented [...] "At least, that's how I imagine we get acts like FEMM, the mesmerizing J-pop electro duo with a backstory more inventive than anything on the SyFy channel right now." [...] Osberg praised the producers and songwriters for being hidden pioneers in order to popularize the group, as she felt producers now were more [...] "the frontmen". Corynn Smith from MTV Iggy was impressed by their English language skills and commented [...] "The pair’s overwhelmingly English discography has something for everyone with electronic taste, whether you’re feeling like a romantic trance trip a la [...] "We Flood the Night", craving a techno remix of '70s J-pop hit [...] "UFO", or in a twerk-tastic, rubber-maid-outfit-clad [...] "Fxxk Boyz Get Money" [...] kinda mood." ...|$|E

Consequently he chose for the head of his cabinet a bright and sensible boy, and had him educated as a Minister of State. For Minister of Finance, he chose another boy with a very honest countenance, and for the other members of his cabinet, suitable youths were selected. He also said, that he thought there ought to be another officer, one who would be a sort of Minister of General Comfort, who would keep an eye on the health and happiness of the subjects, and would also see that every thing went all right in the palace, not only in regard to meals, <b>but</b> <b>lots</b> of other things.

This would be, precisely, on the subject of that freedom, which she now quickly spoke of as complete. [...] "That's of course by itself a great boon; so please don't think I don't know it.

Yet she couldn't help also knowing that an important effect, for his judgment, or at least for his amusement--which was his feeling, since, marvellously, he did have feeling--was produced by it.

He can stay at home in comfort with his wife, settle up his accounts, and do what he likes, and the day before he is to be swooped down on, he gets notice from us, and comfortably goes to Chicago, or Jacksonville, where he can take his ease until we post him of the next move of the enemy.

There have been cases where a gentleman has had six months or a year of perfect comfort, by the detectives being thrown off by a letter like this.

Thick, short, and buttoned closely into his old frock coat, he walked toward Covent Garden market. He never missed that daily promenade to the Tube for Highgate, and seldom some critical transaction on the way in connection with vegetables and fruit. Generations might be born, and hats might change, wars be fought, and Forsytes fade away, but Thomas Gradman, faithful and grey, would take his daily walk and buy his daily vegetable. Times were not what they were, and his son had lost a leg, and they never gave him those nice little plaited baskets to carry the stuff in now, and these Tubes were convenient things--still he mustn't complain; his health was good considering his time of life, and after fifty-four years in the Law he was getting a round eight hundred a year and a little worried of late, because it was mostly collector's commission on the rents, and with all this conversion of Forsyte property going on, it looked like drying up, and the price of living still so high; but it was no good worrying--"The good God made us all"--as he was in the habit of saying; still, house property in London--he didn't know what Mr. Roger or Mr. James would say if they could see it being sold like this--seemed to show a lack of faith; but Mr. Soames--he worried. Life and lives in being and twenty-one years after--beyond that you couldn't go; still, he kept his health wonderfully--and Miss Fleur was a pretty little thing--she was; she'd marry; <b>but</b> <b>lots</b> of people had no children nowadays--he had had his first child at twenty-two; and Mr. Jolyon, married while he was at Cambridge, had his child the same year--gracious Peter! That was back in '69, a long time before old Mr. Jolyon--fine judge of property--had taken his Will away from Mr. James--dear, yes! Those were the days when they were buyin' property right and left, and none of this khaki and fallin' over one another to get out of things; and cucumbers at twopence; and a melon--the old melons, that made your mouth water! Fifty years since he went into Mr. James' office, and Mr. James had said to him: [...] "Now, Gradman, you're only a shaver--you pay attention, and you'll make your five hundred a year before you've done." [...] And he had, and feared God, and served the Forsytes, and kept a vegetable diet at night. And, buying a copy of John Bull--not that he approved of it, an extravagant affair--he entered the Tube elevator with his mere brown-paper parcel, and was borne down into the bowels of the earth.|$|E
