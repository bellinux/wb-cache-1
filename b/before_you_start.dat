500|$|Jack Shepherd of The Independent was {{slightly}} {{more critical of}} the early episodes of the season, saying the ideological battle between Murdock and Castle [...] "is the crux of these first few episodes and also highlights the main problem with Daredevil" [...] pointing out that [...] "there is no real bad guy here" [...] and there [...] "is only so many times you can watch an episode end with Daredevil and Punisher beating each other up <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> thinking there is a glitch in the Matrix." [...] He also agreed with Fitzpatick regarding Curtis-Hall's presence as Ben Urich not being filled in the season. Despite this, Shepherd added that the season began to pick up by the fourth episode, {{with the introduction of}} Elektra, capping with episodes six and seven, which he called [...] "by far the season’s best, laying the foundation for an exciting story ahead", while also praising Cox, Henson, Woll, Bernthal and Yung for their performances. Daniel Fienberg, reviewing the first seven episodes for The Hollywood Reporter, expressed similar sentiments as Shepherd, feeling the episodes missed what Vincent D'Onofrio brought as Wilson Fisk in the first season, or at least [...] "the through-line threat that he presented...Fortunately, the [...] are vividly realized and the action is still visceral and brutal and maybe the big picture will emerge in the season's second half. Because of the portrayals of those two characters, he felt [...] "that there's a challenge to remain wholly invested in plotlines that don't involve them". Despite being [...] "right on the edge of desensitization" [...] regarding the fight scenes, Fienberg still praised them, highlighting the different styles Elektra and the Punisher used [...] "vary the dynamic enough".|$|E
2500|$|Keaton began {{studying}} acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City. She initially studied acting under the Meisner technique, an ensemble acting technique first {{evolved in the}} 1930s by Sanford Meisner, a New York stage actor/acting coach/director {{who had been a}} member of The Group Theater (1931–1940). She has described her acting technique as, [...] " [...] only as good as the person you're acting with ... As opposed to going it on my own and forging my path to create a wonderful performance without the help of anyone. I always need the help of everyone!" [...] According to Jack Nicholson, [...] "She approaches a script sort of like a play in that she has the entire script memorized <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> doing the movie, which I don't know any other actors doing that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the {{previous}} album, which involved creating [...] "microloops" [...] that involved building up one-bar samples into multiple bars {{that would make}} up a full song, Palomo said that in composing this album, he recorded a riff from a sound he made and tried to [...] "keep that momentum up". On Era Extraña, {{in order to develop}} ideas he was having while recording the record, it was necessary for him to have more control of the effects and instruments he was using for the album. Making the album helped him learn how to create synth sounds and become a [...] "gear geek", instead of relying on presets as he did with his previous works. He said, [...] "The more tedious aspects of production do have the capacity to take the wind out of your sails, so you always have to navigate through that as quickly as you can <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> feeling burnt on the song, before you forget that initial spark that made you even want to write it in the first place".|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, you see, Pony," [...] said Jim Leonard, [...] "what a {{good thing}} it was that I thought about {{provisioning}} <b>you</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>started.</b> What makes <b>you</b> look so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{brooding}} over them. Spike, I'll {{tell you}} something which will console you a little <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> out on your wanderings. That necklace was paste." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will {{go round}} {{in the morning and}} see how they are," [...] he concluded, [...] "and bring you round word <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> on your rounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By far {{the more}} {{sensible}} thing to do," [...] he remarked carelessly. [...] "Have {{a glass of}} wine, Reynolds, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>start.</b> You've a wet drive before you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{is common}} report," [...] Crawshay assured him. [...] "Besides, as you know, the New York press {{got hold of}} the story <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>started,</b> and the facts were in all the evening papers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I told <b>you</b> that <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>started</b> in," [...] young Tom remarked, [...] "but {{when you}} get mad, you won't listen to sense. And then there's the Honourable Asa Gray, who wants to {{represent}} the Northeastern some day in the United States Senate." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{seemed so}} {{positive}} {{about it that}} I was not a bit surprised when the messenger came, and {{said that you were}} at the count's here, and that I was to ride with him post haste, so as to catch <b>you</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>started</b> to join the king at Breslau.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are back}} earlier than I expected, Mark. <b>You</b> told me <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>started</b> {{that the wind}} was in the east, and {{that you might be}} a long time getting to Amsterdam unless it changed. I have been {{watching}} the vane on the church, and it has been pointing east ever since.|$|R
6000|$|... "This," [...] he said, [...] "Maclutha gave to me, for you.

It contains some of the principal jewels taken from the treasure house; and she said they might make you and the princess rich, when you reach home.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{there is}} one thing {{necessary}} <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>start.</b> I must see you. There is no reason on earth for our remaining here, except that mamma has not made up her mind. If she will consent to go back <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>start,</b> it will be best so. Otherwise, you must take the trouble to come here,--where, I am afraid, you will not be received as a welcome guest. I have told mamma that if I cannot see you here {{in a manner that is}} becoming, I shall go out and meet you in the streets, in a manner that is unbecoming.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} say a few words to you, Frank, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> for London about this business." [...] Frank {{signified}} by a gesture, that he was quite ready to listen to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Half-past eight," [...] said Hartley at last; [...] "time {{to knock}} off. I’ve {{put a few}} small plants in your bag for you; better put them in in the morning <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{fell and}} struck his head, the night you left. I {{thought he would}} die." [...] Staniford {{reported}} his own diagnosis, not the doctor's; but he was perhaps in {{the right to do}} this. [...] "I had made him go down to the wharf with me; I wanted to see <b>you</b> again, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>started,</b> and I thought we might find you on the boat."

6000|$|... "You'll {{go off in}} a {{spell of}} that kind some day," [...] said young Tom, opening the valise and extracting a bottle. Uncorking it, he pressed it to his father's lips, and with his own pocket-handkerchief (old Tom not {{possessing}} such an article) wiped the perspiration from Mr. Gaylord's brow and the drops from his shabby black coat. [...] "There's no use gettin' mad at Austen. He's dead right--you can't lobby this thing through, and <b>you</b> knew it <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>started.</b> If <b>you</b> hadn't lost your temper, you wouldn't have tried." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You are {{brooding}} over them. Spike, I'll {{tell you}} something which will console you a little, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> out on your wanderings. It's in confidence, so keep it dark. That necklace was paste." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's nonsense. You are {{not going}} to Kimberley all at once. The young ladies expect you to bring out a lot of {{diamonds}} and show them <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>start.</b> Have you seen his diamonds, Miss Lawrie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go not out fasting," [...] {{his host}} said. [...] "Take {{a cup of}} wine and some food <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>start.</b> You may be some time before you get an {{opportunity}} of eating again if {{what they say is}} true." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, Marie," [...] {{said her}} father, {{speaking}} in Dutch, [...] "so {{you have found}} him at last," [...] and he nodded towards me, adding: [...] "You should be flattered, little man.

6000|$|... 'Then {{if you are}} so {{uncertain}} of her movements, do you not think you had better let me learn them <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>start?</b> She {{might not even be}} gone home, and you would not like to come back here again; if--' ...|$|E
5000|$|Still, she is {{immediately}} receptive to Chuck's good nature and humor, and she much later admits to Chuck that she fell for {{him during the}} first episode [...] "after you fixed my phone and <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>started</b> defusing bombs with computer viruses." [...] While Sarah lacks Chuck's openly trusting nature, she quickly recognizes that Chuck is just a regular guy and not a threat, and chooses {{to protect him from}} the NSA team led by John Casey. A series-long character arc involves her gradually overcoming both professional barriers and deep-rooted relationship baggage from her past to let her guard down and develop a relationship with Chuck.|$|R
40|$|Yellow sweatered woman, I saw <b>you</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>started</b> crying. <b>You</b> {{were walking}} up the street, toward town. I {{was on my way}} back from the trails along the cliff, from looking at the three {{sandstone}} sisters. You held the leash of a wrinkle-faced dog, and you had brown shoes and crooked legs and gray hair that met your shoulders. You were small and slightly hunched and your dog seemed to know that you couldn’t walk fast, although sometimes he would pull, ever so gently, on his ropey leash, his white paws speeding up into a trot. He saw me and halted protectively in front of you. Your yellow sweater, gray woolen skirt...|$|R
25|$|Yes, it was difficult. The chemo really {{knocked me}} down, but I guess they {{almost have to}} kill <b>you</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> can <b>start</b> in your recovery.
