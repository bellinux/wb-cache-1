50|$|Williams {{was again}} {{called upon to}} serve as the Steelers lead running back after another Le'Veon <b>Bell</b> <b>suspension,</b> this time for the first three games of the season. After two weeks in the 2016 season, he was the league leader in rushing yards.|$|E
5000|$|After {{being arrested}} with then-teammate LeGarrette Blount on DUI and {{marijuana}} possession charges in August 2014, Bell was suspended by the NFL {{for the first}} four games of the 2015 regular season. On April 9, 2015, it was reported that the suspension was reduced to three games. On July 28, 2015, <b>Bell's</b> <b>suspension</b> was reduced from three games to two following a successful appeal ...|$|R

5000|$|The Type 2 Ke-To {{was based}} on the Type 98, using the same engine and <b>bell</b> crank <b>suspension.</b> However, the gun turret was {{enlarged}} and the main armament was changed to the more powerful Type 1 37 mm gun, with a muzzle velocity of 800 m/s. The new 37 mm gun used gave the tank [...] "slightly better performance". The designation “Type 2” represented the year 1942, “Ke” represented “light”, and “To” represented the number seven.|$|R
50|$|The first {{suggestion}} {{for a larger}} Infantry Tank was made in 1936, with specification A12. The design was produced by the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, and Vulcan Foundry {{was selected as the}} manufacturer. A12 used a number of design elements of the A7, a medium tank that was built in limited numbers in the early 1930s whose mechanical layout was used for many following designs. With its greatly increased armor, a lack of power was seen as a problem. The solution was to use two AEC straight-six water-cooled diesel engines, used in London buses, providing up to 87 hp each. These were linked along a common shaft. Suspension was to use the 'Japanese Type' <b>bell</b> crank <b>suspension</b> used on the A7.|$|R
50|$|The Type 87 Chi-I had {{a complex}} {{parallelogram}} suspension system with {{two pairs of}} road bogie wheels per leaf spring arrangement. Hara designed a <b>bell</b> crank scissors <b>suspension</b> that paired the bogie wheels and connected them to a coil spring mounted horizontally outside the hull. This suspension became standard on {{the majority of the}} subsequently designed Japanese tanks and can be seen on the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank and Type 97 Chi-Ha, as examples.|$|R
5000|$|Within 24 {{hours of}} the second verdict, Commissioner <b>Bell</b> {{extended}} the <b>suspensions</b> of Filchock and Hapes indefinitely. He did this, he said, because {{he had found the}} players [...] "guilty of actions detrimental to the welfare of the National Football League and of professional football." [...] This suspension applied not only to the NFL, but to all minor leagues associated with it. It did not apply to the new All-America Football Conference, but they were not about to pick up a player banned by the senior league for gambling connections. In effect, Filchock was banned from playing professional football in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Like the US Army (which {{utilized}} French and British {{tanks in}} World War I), the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) {{did not have}} tanks of its own in World War I, so it started out by purchasing foreign tanks for evaluation during World War I and right after the war ended. Like many other nations, the Japanese initially didn't embrace the tank, as it didn't have the cavalry tradition. Cavalry was used for reconnaissance in the mountainous countryside, and initially, as with most other armies, the first designs were constrained by the tank's infantry-support role. Building tanks of their own met several problems, as Japan's priority tended to be with naval procurements so production for tank steel was on a lower level. However, they finally began designing tanks by the mid-1920s. Inspired by European designs, the Japanese tank program designed and developed the tanks which facilitated their campaigns in China and the Soviet-Japanese border conflicts, prior to World War II. They introduced many innovations as they built their designs, including <b>bell</b> crank <b>suspensions,</b> were pioneers in amphibious tanks, {{and the use of}} diesel engines that were less likely to catch fire compared with gasoline tank engines that were being used at the time. The Japanese generals had made a mistake in their assessment of the tanks used against China, a country whose army had only three tank battalions, and few anti-tank weapons.|$|R
25|$|The Type 87 Chi-I had a Type 90 57mm cannon as {{its main}} armament, with one machine {{gun in the}} front hull glacis and another located in a small rear turret. The armour was riveted steel plates with a minimum {{thickness}} of 6mm and a maximum of 17mm. The engine compartment was located {{in the middle of}} the hull and the tank was powered by a V8 gasoline engine. The tank chassis had a complex parallelogram suspension system with two pairs of road bogie wheels per leaf spring arrangement. Hara later designed a <b>bell</b> crank scissors <b>suspension</b> which paired the bogie wheels and connected them to a coil spring mounted horizontally outside the hull. This suspension became standard on the majority of the subsequently designed Japanese tanks and can be seen on the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank and Type 97 Chi-Ha, as examples.|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{previously}} published exposure-effect model of Electroencephalography (EEG) -awakening reactions (AWR) due to nightly church bell noise events, {{as well as}} on geocoded building and population data, we estimated the total number of the church bell noise induced awakenings on the population of the Canton of Zurich, in Switzerland. The calculated mean number of EEG awakenings per person in the studied region, triggered by church bell ringing, varied between 0 and about 5. 5 per night. The results suggest that up to 120 - 150 m distance from churches, on average more than one additional EEG awakening occurs per night per person. An estimated 2. 5 - 3. 5 percent of the population in the Canton of Zurich experiences at least one additional awakening per night due to church bell noise. To provide a simple decision support tool for authorities that consider limiting bell ringing in the night in some form, we simulated different scenarios to estimate the effects of different sound attenuation measures at the belfry as well as the effects of different lengths and positions of nocturnal <b>bell</b> ringing <b>suspension</b> periods. The number of awakenings could be reduced by more than 99 percent by, for example, suspending church bell ringing between midnight and 06 h in the morning. A reduction of the number of AWRs of about 75 percent could be achieved by reducing the sound-pressure levels of bells by 5 dB...|$|R
5000|$|The Chi-Ni was {{therefore}} envisioned as a smaller, lighter {{alternative to the}} Chi-Ha, a medium tank closer to the original Chief-of-Staff Operations preference for more [...] "lightly armored infantry support vehicles". The hull was of a monocoque design and welding was used more extensively than previous tanks (although riveting was still used). This was unlike previous Japanese tanks which were riveted around a framework. The Chi-Ni also shared the same <b>bell</b> crank <b>suspension</b> as the Chi-Ha that {{would continue to be}} used by later Japanese tanks {{until the end of the}} Second World War. The hull was designed with a streamlined silhouette to protect from shell damage. The crew of the Chi-Ni, unlike the Chi-Ha was only made up of three men, with the tank commander acting as both a gunner and loader in the small, single-man turret. The turret did not have room for any coaxial machine gun. The driver was seated in the hull on the left hand side, with the third crew member, a machine gunner, was seated to right of the driver. The tank was initially planned to be armed with the Type 89 I-Gos Type 90 57 mm gun but a new tank gun was being designed at the time to replace the lower velocity gun. This improved tank gun was the Type 97 57 mm tank gun. A single, forward firing, 7.7×58mm Arisaka Type 97 machine gun was mounted in the hull. The diameter of the turret ring for both tanks was made as large as possible to allow for any future up-gunning of the tanks. The tank was powered by a Mitsubishi 135 hp diesel engine. There are also documents stating that the Chi-Ni was tested with a 120 hp Mitsubishi A6120VDe air-cooled diesel engine from a Type 95 Ha-Go. The Chi-Ni was also equipped with a 'tadpole tail', a tail extension attached to the back of the tank to allow it to better cross trenches. Both prototypes were completed and tested in early 1937.|$|R
50|$|Bell re-debut for Burton Albion for {{the third}} time in the first round of League Cup, in a 2-2 draw against Sheffield United and played 120 minutes. Bell was the only Burton Albion's player to be missed, as they beat them 5-4 in the penalty shoot-out. In the next game in the opening game of the season against Rotherham United, Bell started in the match, but was sent-off in the 62nd minutes after a second bookable offense, in a 3-0 lost. After serving a <b>suspension,</b> <b>Bell</b> was able to make amends when he scored his first Burton Albion goal of the season, in a 3-1 win over York City on 19 September 2012. In the second round of the FA Cup, Bell captained Burton Albion for the first time against his former club, Crewe. Weeks later, on 29 December 2012, Bell scored his second goal for the club and setting up the second goal of the game, in a 2-0 win over Southend United. Bell later added two more goals later in the season against Exeter City and Dagenham & Redbridge. During the season, Bell, who had captain the team for a number of games during the season, helped the club with their highest ever finish in the {{football}} league. Their 4th place in League Two saw them face Bradford City in the playoffs. Bell, however, received a 4-game suspension for a red card given towards the end of the season and was unavailable for the final, should Burton Albion have reached it. After the club unsuccessfully win the play-offs, Bell made forty-three appearance in his first full season at the club. Despite this, Bell was nominated for the club's Player of the Year and was rewarded with a new one-year contract in April 2013.|$|R
