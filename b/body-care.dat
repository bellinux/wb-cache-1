5000|$|Nivea (...) is a German {{personal}} care brand {{that specializes in}} skin- and <b>body-care.</b> It {{is owned by the}} Hamburg-based company Beiersdorf Global AG. The company was founded on March 28, 1882, by pharmacist Paul Carl Beiersdorf. In 1890, it was sold to Oscar Troplowitz. Troplowitz kept working with his scientific consultant Paul Gerson Unna and the German chemist Isaac Lifschütz on a new skin care cream. In 1900, Lifschütz developed a water-in-oil emulsion as a skin cream with Eucerit, the first stable emulsion of its kind. This was the basis for Eucerin and, later, Nivea. Nivea comes from the Latin word niveus/nivea/niveum, meaning [...] "snow-white".|$|E
50|$|Some of the world's strongest brands were {{originally}} built through low-cost community-based marketing. Nike, Starbucks and Google are some examples. When companies focus first on {{meeting the needs}} of the people they serve, they don't have to spend big money to attract new customers. And when they stay close to their communities they don't need market research to tell them what people want.Kiehl's, for example, is a premium <b>body-care</b> product used largely by models and the elite. People from around the world make pilgrimages to the original New York City store. A renowned global brand now owned by L'Oreal, Kiehl's packaging is plain, its stores are basic and from its 1851 founding until today, the brand has never advertised. Success has been driven by products tailored to customers' needs, word-of-mouth promotion, free in-store product trials and the personal connections forged by requiring active community involvement of every employee.|$|E
5000|$|In general, children's {{exposure}} to phthalates {{is greater than}} that of adults. In a 1990s Canadian study that modeled ambient exposures, it was estimated that daily {{exposure to}} DEHP was 9 μg/kg bodyweight/day in infants, 19 μg/kg bodyweight/day in toddlers, 14 μg/kg bodyweight/day in children, and 6 μg/kg bodyweight/day in adults. Infants and toddlers are at the greatest risk of exposure, because of their mouthing behavior. <b>Body-care</b> products containing phthalates are a source of exposure for infants. The authors of a 2008 study [...] "observed that reported use of infant lotion, infant powder, and infant shampoo were associated with increased infant urine concentrations of metabolites, and this association is strongest in younger infants. These findings suggest that dermal exposures may contribute significantly to phthalate body burden in this population." [...] Though they did not examine health outcomes, they noted that [...] "Young infants are more vulnerable to the potential adverse effects of phthalates given their increased dosage per unit body surface area, metabolic capabilities, and developing endocrine and reproductive systems." ...|$|E

This led to a {{partnership}} with the Kenyan Red Cross, and a village-based women's social enterprise pressing seed-oil for local use in cooking and <b>body-care.</b> Barasch coined the term [...] "regenerative enterprise" [...] to describe a proposed business of commodities produced from moringa seed oil and high-protein leaf powder. Barasch conceived and launched the Green World Children's Choirs in 2012, collaborating with Disney and Broadway composer Alan Menken, Broadway lyricist Lynne Ahrens, and educator Yunus Sola of the Abraham's Path Initiative. The first choir was drawn from Malaysia's Tenby Schools. In 2013, Green World Schools programs began to incorporate peace and conflict resolution, which expanded into a [...] "Trees for Peace" [...] movement initiated by GWC-Kenya country director Will Ruddick to avert violence in the Kenyan elections. This was joined by youth organizations like the Kenyan Scouts and the national Wildlife Clubs. It led to a new project, funded by Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund, to restore Kenya's Pungu Watershed. In 2013, Barasch began an outreach to global faith communities under the slogan, [...] "Plant a seed of spirit in the soil of the world." [...] In January 2015, he launched an initiative, the [...] "Green World Charter to Renew the Tree of Life," [...] in partnership with the Parliament of the World's Religions.

40|$|Recently, {{the rapid}} {{advancement}} in technologies of modern intelligent objects {{has led to}} a new network paradigm, called the Internet of Things (IoT), in which every networked and automated object has been connected in a pervasive manner. New types of IoT-based application services are thus presented. In a healthcare oriented environment, the usage of IoT has brought opportunities for assisting physicians (or nurses) to provide on-demand and real-time <b>body-care</b> services to patients with higher accuracy and better efficiency. However, while IoT-oriented techniques deliver such advantages, they may encounter system security vulnerabilities and patient privacy threats not seen in the past. In this paper, we propose a robust IoT-based healthcare system, called BSNCare+, in which body sensor networks (BSNs) are adopted as the underlying communication architecture. In the proposed healthcare system, we exploit lightweight crypto-primitives to construct a secure communication mechanism that does achieve data confidentiality and entity authentication among intelligent body sensors, the mobile gateway and the backend BSN-Care server. In addition, we evaluate the performance of the proposed healthcare system using the Raspberry PI series platform. The results show the practicability and feasibility of BSNCare+...|$|E
40|$|Simulation {{learning}} in nursing has long {{made use of}} mannequins, standardized actors and role play to allow students opportunity to practice technical <b>body-care</b> skills and interventions. Even though numerous strategies {{have been developed to}} mimic or amplify clinical situations, a common problem that is difficult to overcome in even the most well-executed simulation experiences, is that students may realize the setting is artificial and fail to fully engage, remember or apply the learning. Another problem is that students may learn technical competence but remain uncertain about communicating with the person. Since communication capabilities are imperative in human service work, simulation learning that only achieves technical competence in students is not fully effective for the needs of nursing education. Furthermore, while simulation learning is a burgeoning space for innovative practices, it has been criticized for the absence of a basis in theory. It is within this context that an innovative simulation learning experience named “Mask-Ed TM (KRS simulation) ”, has been deconstructed and the active learning components examined. Establishing a theoretical basis for creative teaching and learning practices provides an understanding of how, why and when simulation learning has been effective and it may help to distinguish aspects of the experience that could be improved. Three conceptual theoretical fields help explain the power of this simulation technique: Vygotskian sociocultural learning theory, applied theatre and embodiment...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{developments}} {{within the}} current global self-care regime {{have increased the}} potential of many individuals {{to control their own}} bodies, and to have their bodies surveilled by others (Shilling, 2003). The body is understood as a project that needs to be “worked at and accomplished as part of an individual’s self-identity” (Shilling, 2003 : 4) in this time of ‘high modernity’ (Giddens, 1991). The project of cosmetic surgery is one example of how modern individuals attribute significance both to their bodies and the way their bodies look. In a South Korean context, the cosmetic surgery scene is especially interesting to examine {{in the light of the}} uniquely Korean practice of giving cosmetic surgery as a gift, especially to daughters. Ironically, the body has to remain unaltered from how it has been received at birth according to the Neo-Confucian tradition, which continues to form the ideological base of contemporary Korean society. Moreover, this tradition teaches that inward goodness does not depend upon one’s outer appearance, something that is quite opposite to “popular physiognomic assumptions that the body, especially the face, is a reflection of the self” (Featherstone, 2010 : 195). This thesis specifically attempts to understand the practice of cosmetic surgery within Korean society, arguing that this practice is ironically supported by Korea’s remaining Neo-Confucian traditions as well as by contemporary global <b>body-care</b> regimes, which somehow interlock with Neo-Confucian ideas concerning body management...|$|E
40|$|Abstrakt: Marketing {{communication}} {{is one of}} the most culture-oriented tool of the marketing mix. The companies can use different strategies in the international marketing communication. These strategies must be based on the all-over strategy of the company. The general strategy is divided into particular strategies for divisions and departments of the company (marketing department, sales, production etc.). We observe two main strategies in the international communication of the companies [...] globalisation strategy which tries to normalize all marketing communication activities through different countries, whereas the adaptation strategy forces the companies to think locally and act locally. Global company Sara Lee operates at almost all the markets of the world and owns about 80 different brands of food, beverages, <b>body-care</b> and house-care products. In Czech Republic Sara Lee owns a leading brand in tea market [...] the Pickwick brand. The Pickwick brand is an international brand because besides Czech Republic it operates also on the other 7 markets in Europe and also in the United States. The tea market in the Czech Republic is very important for Pickwick Brand, because it {{is one of the}} markets where Pickwick enjoys the biggest success. The specifics of this market are based not only on the consumer behaviour and preferences, but also on the activities of the competition and also activities of the various sales channels of which the most important are the international retail chains. International communication of the Pickwick brand is based on the marketing strategy approved centrally. The communication strategy, positioning of the brand and tactical steps are decided by the managers of different countries together. We can see either normalisation features or adaptation features in the communication strategy of the Pickwick brand. The examples are the activation of the novelties of the Pickwick brand in Czech Republic or Hungary. Both countries have chosen a different concept of 360 ° idea, which they worked out in different activations. The Pickwick brand develops in long-term, and nowadays her goal is to strenghten its well-being segment (green, white and herbal teas), because this segment is the most dynamic one. Besides this segment the Pickwick brand could also focus on other, smaller segments such as teas for children. A large number of the products in originally "adult" categories prove that this segment is very interesting and attractive, too. The Pickwick brand has done alrady the ads focused on children, and that's why the brand could follow easily the communication schemes...|$|E
40|$|If ACP {{countries}} are {{to improve their}} agricultural productivity they must do so through their rural people. And, if full employment, food self-sufficiency and an exportable {{surplus of agricultural products}} are to be achieved, rural people must tee motivated. Owner ship of land is a powerful incentive, especially among young people who see no future for themselves as hired labour but who arewilling to work atbuilding up their own family holding. In the majority of Caribbean countries, widespread land ownership is very recent but, in several countries where land reform and re-distribution has begun, the benefits are already evident. For much of their modern history most Caribbean countries were developed as plantation economies, where the mass of the population worked as labour on monoculture estates owned by a minority of landowners or foreign-based companies. However, many foreign-based companies, and even some large local landowners, found the combination of poor prices for the main plantation crops (banana, citrus, cocoa, coconut and sugar) and rising labour costs and unrest in the 1970 s too problematic, and either sold up or abandoned their estates. As a result, governments gained possession and were provided with the opportunity to offer the land in small blocks to previously landless people. Privatization in Grenada In Grenada, by 1983 a succession of governments had acquired 36 estates, ranging from 17 - 105 hectares (40 - 250 acres). In 1986 it was decided by the Government to 'divest' these estates: to divide them into economically viable units and to offer them for private ownership. In common with the majority of islands in the Caribbean, Grenada has a very steep terrain so at divestment, farmers were encouraged to continue to grow one of the major crops - banana, cocoa and nutmeg but to diversify by growing other crops for food and for sale. In order to do this without encouraging erosion, a programme of soil and water conservation was started in which the farmers were involved. With FAO technical assistance, settlers were helped to build bench terraces, of eyebrow terraces, access roads and dams. A wide range of fruit trees was planted, while leucaena and Honduran Pine were planted on the steepest land as conservation forest The idea was to provide improved income, long-term security and to involve the new settlers in sustainable production techniques. Considerable progress has been made: people in Grenada are increasingly aware of the need for food self-sufficiency and import-substitution; more locally produced foods are available in markets and for the thriving tourist industry; and surplus fruit is processed for jams, jellies and confectionery. There has been a deliberate policy to choose young people as new settlers and {{there is no shortage of}} applicants: there are 30 - 40 applicants for each farm that becomes available, of whom 80 %- 90 % are in the 25 - 30 age group. Dominica diversifies Similar success has been achieved in Dominica, where the main plantation crops were banana and limes. Again, these remain the major crops on the small farms that have been carved from the big estates. Where banana still offers a good return, some far' mers continue to specialize in the crop, but others have diversified into vegetables and tubers for the local market, ginger for export and also flowers such as ginger lily. In the drier south of the island limes were and remain the major crop but, because of the depressed price over several years, farmers settled here have diversified and grow passion fruit, Aloe vera and forage grasses for feeding to one or two milk cows and 10 - 15 sheep and goats. Some farmers are also keeping one or two breeding pigs. However, land redistribution is seldom sufficient when carried out in isolation, so in Grenada and Dominica, new farmers have been provided with technical advice and assistance with marketing their crops. In Dominica the marketing of new crops has been well developed through the Dominican Export and Import Agency, DEXIA (See Spore N 20). There is a processing facility for limes on the island and a factory for coconut products, such as oil and soap. Aloe vera, a low-growing, succulent plant that thrives on dry, porous soils, is purchased by the Windward Island Aloe Company and is used in a wide range of cosmetics and <b>body-care</b> products. All these marketing intitiatives have resulted in firm markets, increased local employment and added value to products, to the benefit of farmers and the national economy. Integrated development Credit has also played an important role in developing the small-farmer economy in Dominica, as has the construction of feeder roads into previously inaccesible parts of the island. The United Nations lnternational Fund for Agricultural Development has assisted by providing funds for credit while IFAD and the European Development Fund have financed access roads. It is clearly evident that without an integrated approach of technical advice, credit, availability of inputs, access roads and marketing, land redistribution alone would not have had the desired impact and might even have resulted in stagnant production, frustration and a decline in standards of soil and water conservation. If ACP {{countries are}} to improve their agricultural productivity they must do so through their rural people. And, if full employment, food self-sufficiency and an exportable surplus of agricultural products are to be achieved, rural people must tee [...] ...|$|E
