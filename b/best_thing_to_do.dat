Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, {{so in a way}} it would be like being in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without incident {{in the first week of}} June 1917.|$|E

500|$|Others {{have noted}} {{that the lack of}} {{coverage}} is not simply a media issue. Peter Fahy, the spokesman on race issues for the Association of Chief Police Officers said: [...] "A lot of police officers and other professionals feel almost the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to try and avoid [...] for fear of being criticised. This is not healthy". Montague suggests the lack of police appeals in cases involving white victims may be a cause of the lack of media coverage. Evidence of this was seen in the Parker case, with the police initially appearing keen to dismiss the possible racist aspect of the murder, stating [...] "there was {{no reason to believe that}} the attack was racially motivated".|$|E
500|$|For {{the moment}} it was safer ashore. The cavalrymen overran the airstrip. Sporadic {{opposition}} allowed them {{to set up the}} antiaircraft machine guns on the beach, unload supplies, and patrol inland. Two soldiers were killed and three wounded. At 16:00, General MacArthur and Admiral Kinkaid came ashore. The general inspected the position. A lieutenant warned him a Japanese sniper had been killed in the vicinity just a few minutes before. [...] "That's the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with them," [...] the General replied. He decided to stay, ordering Chase to hold his position until the follow-up force arrived, then returned to Phoenix. Fechteler's force departed at 17:29, the transports having unloaded and most of the bombardment force having exhausted its ammunition. Bush and Stockton remained to provide on-call naval fire support.|$|E

500|$|Dave McKean drew {{most of the}} {{principal}} art, {{as well as the}} cover art of the graphic novel. In illustrating the story, McKean blends paintings, drawings, photography, and mixed-media collage to come up with striking page designs, and dense symbols. He has said that he was [...] "trying to make the book despite the subject, rather than because of it. At the end of the day, if you really love to do Batman comics, then that's probably the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Not liking them, and then trying to make something out of them is just a waste of time." [...] He also came to think that [...] "overpainted, lavish illustrations in every panel just didn't work. It hampers the storytelling." [...] McKean liberally uses symbolism, imagery, and surrealism, and many scenes involve the use of symbols to denote a particular psychological device. For example, a Greek inscription can be seen scratched on the doorway of Maxie Zeus's electroshock chamber, which translates into [...] "Discover thyself." [...] Much of this symbolism was later explained and expanded upon by the release of the 15th Anniversary Edition containing Morrison's annotated script.|$|E
500|$|... 2003 {{marked a}} {{significant}} {{turning point in}} Sarsgaard's career, when he starred in the feature film Shattered Glass. He depicted journalist Charles Lane, the lead editor of The New Republic. Shattered Glass {{is based on the}} real events of journalist Stephen Glass' career at The New Republic during the mid-1990s and his fall when his widespread journalistic fraud is exposed. During promotion of the film, Sarsgaard noted of his portrayal of Lane: [...] "I just wanted to get his perspective on the actual events. [...] I think that I tried to have some respect for myself and that way you're respecting the real person you're playing. I've done it a number of times. And it's always a little bit confusing. The <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is just to ignore the fact, I think, that you're playing somebody who is a real life character." [...] According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, [...] "Peter Sarsgaard is appealingly level, a stolid straight-shooter as Lane". A reviewer from the Chicago Tribune noted that Sarsgaard plays Lane with [...] "great subtlety and grace". The newspaper concluded with, [...] "The character doesn't seethe with personal resentment; when he does a slow burn, he conveys a much deeper sense of a man's value system being violated past the breaking point." [...] Sarsgaard's performance in the film earned him his first Golden Globe Award nomination and an Independent Spirit Award nomination.|$|E

2500|$|Both [...] "deaf" [...] and [...] "heaven" [...] (here scanned as one syllable) have tonic stress, {{but that}} of [...] "deaf" [...] is {{normally}} subordinated to that of [...] "heaven", allowing them comfortably to fill odd/even positions, but not even/odd. A reversal of the third ictus (as shown above) is normally preceded by at least a slight intonational break, which [...] "deaf heaven" [...] does not allow. Peter Groves calls this a [...] "harsh mapping", and recommends that in performance [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to prolong the subordinated S-syllable ... {{the effect of this}} is to throw a degree of emphasis on it".|$|E

After inquiring as to the elephant's behavior and delaying for some time, he shoots the elephant several times, wounding it but unable to kill it. The narrator then leaves the beast, unable to be in its presence as it continues to suffer. He later learns that it was stripped, nearly to the bone, within hours. His elderly colleagues agree that killing the elephant was the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but the younger ones believe that it was worth more than the Indian it killed.

2500|$|The {{subsequent}} Congressional {{investigation was}} chaired by James A. Garfield.

The investigation was alleged on the one hand to have been limited because Virginia Corbin and First Lady Julia Grant were not permitted to testify. Garfield's biographer, Alan Peskin, however, maintains the investigation was quite thorough. The investigation cleared Grant of wrongdoing, but excoriated Gould for his manipulation of the gold market and Corbin for exploiting his personal connections to Grant. Butterfield was implicated for serving as a double agent giving information to Gould. [...] In his Congressional testimony, Gould said Grant [...] "was a very pure, high-minded man; that if he was satisfied what was the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> that was what he would do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after taking}} over from Erich von Falkenhayn as Chief of the General Staff {{in at the}} end of August 1916, Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff, the [...] (First Quartermaster General) ordered the {{building}} of a new defensive line east of the Somme battlefront from Arras to Laon. Ludendorff was unsure as to whether retreating to the [...] (Hindenburg Line) was the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> since withdrawing might diminish the morale of German soldiers and civilians. An offensive was considered if enough reserves could be assembled in the New Year. A study suggested that seventeen divisions might be made available but that this was far too few to have decisive effect in the west. Ludendorff accepted the plan after representations by Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria, commander of Army Group Rupprecht (1st, 2nd, 6th and 7th armies, from the Somme front to the North Sea coast) over the objections of the 1st and 2nd Army commanders.|$|E
2500|$|RC {{approaches}} {{the issue of}} feelings between co-counsellors by having a strict [...] "no-socialising" [...] rule. RC co-counsellors are expected not to socialise or have social or sexual relationships with other co-counsellors unless these relationships pre-dated their becoming co-counsellors. [...] RC specifically rejects the label [...] "transference" [...] for this phenomenon, as this is {{seen as part of}} a [...] "symptomatic" [...] method typical in psychology; the original theory of co-counselling (from RC) teaches that the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in these circumstances is repeatedly counsel on, and [...] "discharge" [...] about, such feelings. In addition, methods of [...] "getting attention out of distress" [...] are available which help with the difficulty of [...] "switching roles" [...] between counselor and client. When taught correctly, counselors are soon able to grasp the difference between counselling relationships and those from outside life. However, sometimes there is a marked pull to [...] "socialise" [...] or confuse the boundaries of the co-counselling relationship with other types of relationships. This is one reason why many consider a well-organised community of co-counsellors with clear rules to be essential in the successful practise of co-counselling.|$|E
2500|$|Now {{continuing}} their {{career as a}} trio, with Ihsahn handling keyboards, vocals, guitars and bass, the band recorded their third album IX Equilibrium and toured Europe and North America. It was around 2000 when Samoth and Trym started to gravitate more towards death metal, while Ihsahn directed his musical exploration towards his side project, Peccatum. Thus, in 2001, Emperor decided to disband after releasing one final album, , composed entirely by Ihsahn. [...] Ihsahn later recalled that [...] "When we announced the split up in 2001, we didn't think we would do anything more with Emperor ever again...The decision was also based on the feeling that Emperor {{had a lot of}} integrity, and that {{if we were going to}} end it, we should end it while we still created great music. [...] For us, the decision was made in the black metal spirit. Since Samoth and I pulled in different directions, we didn't see any point in continuing. [...] The core of the band wasn't intact anymore". Samoth echoed Ihsahn's position: [...] "At that point, we both had other priorities that we wanted to pursue and we both felt that splitting up Emperor was the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> [...] We really wanted to focus on other things, and felt it was the only right thing to do".|$|E

We had some exciting adventures together. One summer day he came rushing home to get his gun, having just seen an immense flock of golden plover come down at a spot a mile or so from home. With his gun and a sack to put the birds in, he mounted his pony, I with him, as our ponies were accustomed to carry two and even three at a pinch. We found the flock where he had seen it alight-- thousands of birds evenly scattered, running about busily feeding on the wet level ground.|$|R
