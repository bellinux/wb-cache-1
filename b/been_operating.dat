5|$|The edmontosaurs {{also showed}} enriched carbon isotope values, which for modern mammals would be {{interpreted}} as a mixed diet of C3 plants (most plants) and C4 plants (grasses); however, C4 plants were extremely rare in the Late Cretaceous if present at all.

A combination of factors is also possible.|$|E
