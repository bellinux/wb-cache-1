50|$|The park {{possesses}} a huge natural wealth, with really different fauna and flora. Some plant here are endemic, like the <b>Spanish</b> <b>Fir</b> (Abies pinsapo) or the Gall Oak. Other animal {{species such as}} the ibex or the otter maintain in this reserve populations of stable individual species. There is one <b>Spanish</b> <b>Fir,</b> the Pinsapo de Las Escaleretas, which has been declared a natural monument. The park also has a chestnut 800 or 1000 years old, the Castaño Santo.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Spanish</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies pinsapo) {{is a true}} relic {{which has}} {{remained}} preserved in some mountain ranges around Málaga and Cádiz. <b>Spanish</b> <b>firs</b> {{are related to the}} North African spruce forests of the Yebala range, in Morocco. They come into contact with Algerian oak (Quercus canariensis) and other oak trees and sometimes even form mixed communities with these. Among the woody species also found in these forests are the hawthorn, barberry, butcher's broom (Ruscus aculeatus), Viburnum tinus, ivy, and Daphne laureola.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spanish</b> <b>fir,</b> {{despite the}} best {{conservation}} and reforestation efforts that have greatly increased its abundance, still has several threats such as fires, urban projects, erosion, excessive visitors and tourists, etc.|$|R
50|$|Ronda is {{situated}} in a very mountainous area about 750 m above mean sea level. The Guadalevín River runs through the city, dividing it in two and carving out the steep, 100-plus-meter- deep El Tajo canyon upon which the city perches. The <b>Spanish</b> <b>fir</b> (abies pinsapo) is endemic to the mountains surrounding Ronda.|$|R
50|$|The {{predominant}} canopy tree in {{the forests}} is Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica). Other conifer trees that grow in this area may include pines such as Aleppo pine and Maritime pine. Firs such as the <b>Spanish</b> <b>fir</b> and the Algerian fir. Junipers such as Juniperus oxycedrus and Juniperus thurifera And Yews such as Taxus baccata.|$|R
50|$|Abies numidica {{grows in}} a high-altitude Mediterranean climate at 1,800-2,004 meters (and rarely down to 1,220 meters) with an annual {{precipitation}} of 1,500-2,000 milliliters, {{the great majority of}} which falls as winter snow; the summers are warm and very dry. It is closely related to Abies pinsapo (<b>Spanish</b> <b>fir),</b> which occurs further west in the Rif mountains of Morocco and in southern Spain.|$|R
25|$|It forms {{dense and}} dark forests in very {{distinct}} enclaves, {{in areas with}} high rainfall (from 2,000 to 3,000mm, due to the sudden cooling, with elevation, of humid winds), at altitudes of over 1,000 metres. The forest has abundant moss and lichens, but very few shrubs and herbaceous plants. In all cases, <b>Spanish</b> <b>fir</b> occupies high mountain zones (such as the Sierra de las Nieves, Sierra Bermeja, and Sierra de Grazalema).|$|R
50|$|In the Spanish {{part of the}} reserve, the Mediterranean climate induces rich {{vegetation}} growth, with forest covering {{more than}} 60% of the area, of which 49% is dominated by deciduous trees. Species include Quercus canariensis (Algerian oak) and Quercus faginea (Portuguese oak). Abies pinsapo (<b>Spanish</b> <b>fir),</b> Culcita macrocarpa, and Dryopteris guanchica {{are some of the}} endangered flora species under strict protection. Many fauna species are also under threat, including Milvus milvus (Red kite), Netta rufina (Red-crested pochard) and Salmo trutta (Brown trout).|$|R
50|$|The Rif region {{receives}} more rainfall {{than any}} other region in Morocco, with some portions receiving upwards of 2,000 mm of precipitation a year. The western and central portions are more rainy and are covered in forests of Atlas cedar, cork oak and holm oak, {{as well as the}} only remaining forests of Moroccan fir, a subspecies of the <b>Spanish</b> <b>fir.</b> The eastern slopes receive less rainfall, and there forests consist mainly of pines, particularly the Aleppo pine and the maritime pine, as well as tetraclinis.|$|R
50|$|Abies pinsapo (<b>Spanish</b> <b>fir)</b> is {{a species}} of fir native to {{southern}} Spain and northern Morocco. Related to other species of Mediterranean firs, it is considered the Andalusian National Tree. In Spain, it appears at altitudes of 900 - 1800 m in the Sierra de Grazalema {{in the province of}} Cádiz and the Sierra de las Nieves and Sierra Bermeja, both near Ronda in the province of Málaga. In Morocco, it is limited to the Rif Mountains at altitudes of 1400 - 2100 m on Jebel Tissouka and Jebel Tazaot.|$|R
50|$|It {{tends to}} forms woods with other firs and beeches. It {{is closely related}} to Bulgarian fir (Abies borisiiregis) further to the {{southeast}} in the Balkan Peninsula, <b>Spanish</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies pinsapo) of Spain and Morocco and Sicilian fir (Abies nebrodensis) in Sicily, differing from these and other related Euro-Mediterranean firs in the sparser foliage, with the leaves spread either side of the shoot, leaving the shoot readily visible from above. Some botanists treat Bulgarian fir and Sicilian fir as varieties of silver fir, as A. alba var. acutifolia and A. alba var. nebrodensis respectively.|$|R

5000|$|Tolox is a {{town and}} {{municipality}} {{in the province of}} Málaga in the autonomous community of Andalusia in southern Spain. The municipality has a population of 2,317 (2006). It is situated in the centre of the Sierra de las Nieves Nature Park {{at the foot of the}} Sierra Blanca and the Sierra Parda. In addition to La Torrecilla peak (1,919 m.), there are ancient woodlands of <b>Spanish</b> <b>Fir</b> and gall oak. The municipality covers 94 km2, has a mean elevation of 285 m. and mean geographical coordinates of 36° 41' 11" [...] N, 4° 54' 16" [...] E. The channel of the Rio Grande flows through the town from northeast to south.|$|R
50|$|In broad terms, {{the typical}} {{vegetation}} of Andalusia is Mediterranean woodland, characterized by leafy xerophilic perennials, {{adapted to the}} long, dry summers. The dominant species of the climax community is the holly oak (Quercus ilex). Also abundant are cork oak (Quercus suber), various pines, and <b>Spanish</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies pinsapo). Due to cultivation, olive (Olea europaea) and almond (Prunus dulcis) trees also abound. The dominant understory is composed of thorny and aromatic woody species, such as rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), thyme (Thymus), and Cistus. In the wettest areas with acidic soils, the most abundant species are the oak and cork oak, and the cultivated Eucalyptus. In the woodlands, leafy hardwoods of genus Populus (poplars, aspens, cottonwoods) and Ulmus (elms) are also abundant; poplars are cultivated in the plains of Granada.|$|R

5|$|Morchella frustrata fruit bodies grow solitary, scattered, or {{in small}} groups in spring, in mountainous forests and maquis. The exact trophic status of the fungus is not yet known with certainty, but it is {{suspected}} to be fucaltitive mycorrhizal or biotrophic. Tree species associated with the fungus include pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), oaks (Quercus spp.), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), and white fir (Abies concolor). In Europe it is often found with holm oak (Quercus ilex), strawberry trees (Arbutus andrachne), olive trees (Olea europaea), <b>Spanish</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies pinsapo), Silver fir (Abies alba) and Scot's pine (Pinus sylvestris). Although it was originally hypothesized that collections of M. frustrata from Turkey might have been recently introduced from North America, numerous collections reported since from remote and undisturbed areas in the Mediterranean and the Alps (including Bresadola's original collection from Trentino), suggest a long-time and well-established presence of this species in Europe. Kuo suggests {{that it might be}} also widely distributed in western North America, but so far has only been confirmed to be present in Oregon and California.|$|R

40|$|The genus Abies {{comprises}} 48 {{species of}} fir trees, {{making it the}} second largest genus in the Pinaceae after Pinus. Phylogenetic analyses using one nuclear and three chloroplast regions confirm the monophyly of the Pinaceae. Results also show that the Pinoideae is sister to Abietoideae and Keteleeria is sister to Abies. Results suggest {{that the number of}} sections in Abies probably need to be reduced to eight rather than ten. The Mexican species are placed in two sections currently but are shown to be monophyletic. The Mediterranean group of species is also shown to be monophyletic but there is little resolution within this clade, again reducing the sectional level of classification appears appropriate in this case. Several origins are speculated for this group including a North American origin via long distance dispersal; however, perhaps the most likely pattern is one of a pan-northern hemispherical distribution subsequently fragmented into refugia from which modem clades have diversified relatively recently. Conservation assessements have been compiled for the Mediterranean taxa, especially those of the south west Mediterranean. These assessments suggest that the level of threat is greater than previously thought for Abies pinspo var. pinsapo, Abies pinsapo var. marocana and A. numidica. The <b>Spanish</b> <b>fir</b> is relisted as Endangered and the Moroccan and Algerian taxa are now considered Critically Endangered. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
