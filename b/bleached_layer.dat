50|$|The exact {{symptoms}} of a chemical burn depend on the chemical involved. Symptoms include itching, bleaching or darkening of skin, burning sensations, trouble breathing, coughing blood and/or tissue necrosis. Common sources of chemical burns include sulfuric acid (H2SO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), lime (CaO), silver nitrate (AgNO3), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Effects depend on the substance; hydrogen peroxide removes a <b>bleached</b> <b>layer</b> of skin, while nitric acid causes a characteristic color change to yellow in the skin, and silver nitrate produces noticeable black stains. Chemical burns may occur through direct contact on body surfaces, including skin and eyes, via inhalation, and/or by ingestion. Lipophilic substances that diffuse efficiently in human tissue, e.g., hydrofluoric acid, sulfur mustard, and dimethyl sulfate, may not react immediately, but instead produce the burns and inflammation hours after the contact. Chemical fabrication, mining, medicine, and related professional fields are examples of occupations where chemical burns may occur. Hydrofluoric acid leaches into the bloodstream and reacts with calcium and magnesium, and the resulting salts can cause cardiac arrest after eating through skin.|$|E
40|$|Coral {{bleaching}} {{has generally}} been recognized as {{the main reason for}} tropical coral reef degradation, but there are few long-term records of coral bleaching events. In this study, trace metals including chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), tin (Sn), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), and yttrium (Y), were analyzed in two Porites corals collected from Meiji Reef in the tropical South China Sea (SCS) to assess differences in trace metal concentrations in bleached compared with unbleached coral growth bands. Ti, V, Cr, and Mo generally showed irregular fluctuations in both corals. <b>Bleached</b> <b>layers</b> contained high concentrations of Mn, Cu, Sn, and Pb. Unbleached layers showed moderately high concentrations of Mn and Cu only. The different distribution of trace metals in Porites may be attributable to different selectivity on the basis of vital utility or toxicity. Ti, V, Cr, and Mo are discriminated against by both coral polyps and zooxanthellae, but Mn, Cu, Sn, and Pb are accumulated by zooxanthellae and only Mn and Cu are accumulated by polyps as essential elements. The marked increase in Cu, Mn, Pb, and Sn are associated with bleaching processes, including mucus secretion, tissue retraction, and zooxanthellae expulsion and occlusion. Variation in these trace elements within the coral skeleton can be used as potential tracers of short-lived bleaching events...|$|R
40|$|Stimulated {{emission}} depletion (STED) nanoscopy {{has emerged}} as a powerful far-field tech-nique for subdiffraction optical imaging and is extensively used in the life sciences to in-vestigate different protein species. In many cases, however, the relative assembly of two (or more) proteins is of interest and needs to be determined with nanometric resolution. Mean-while, STED has also found its way into material science. Yet, the method’s potential for subdiffraction optical writing has so far remained unexplored. This work evidences the de-velopment of a dual-color STED setup with lateral resolving power of 30 nm in both color channels. The method is shown to be applicable to the study of double-stained neuronal pro-teins and aids in establishing a novel sample sectioning technique. As a result the first high-resolution three-dimensional reconstruction of dual-color STED images is rendered possible. Flexible operation of the individual color channels furthermore answers open questions in chemistry and biology. Another key point of this thesis is the realization of STED nano-lithography. Subdiffraction-sized structures are written by <b>bleaching</b> a <b>layer</b> of fluorophores. The underlying concept of bleaching suppression through STED is experimentally intro...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{sheltered}} creeks of Cádiz bay, Ulva thalli form extended mat-like canopies. The {{effect of}} solar ultraviolet radiation on photosynthetic activity, composition of photosynthetic and xanthophyll cycle pigments, {{and the amount}} of RubisCO, chaperonin 60 (CPN 60) and induction of DNA damage in Ulva aff. rotundata Bliding from Southern Spain was assessed in the field. Samples collected from the natural community were covered by screening filters, generating different radiation conditions. During daily cycles, individual thalli showed photoinhibitory effects of the natural solar radiation. This inhibition was even more pronounced in samples only exposed to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Strongly increased heat dissipation in these samples indicated the activity of regulatory mechanisms involved in dynamic photoinhibition. Adverse effects of UV-B radiation on photosynthesis were only observed in combination with high levels of PAR, indicating synergistic effects of the two wavelength ranges. In samples exposed either to PAR + UV-A or to UV-B + UV-A without PAR, no inhibition of photosynthetic quantum yield was found {{in the course of the}} day. At the natural site, the top layer of the mat-like canopies is generally completely bleached. Artificially designed Ulva canopies exhibited fast bleaching of the top layer under the natural solar radiation conditions, while this was not observed in canopies either shielded from UV, or from PAR. The <b>bleached</b> first <b>layer</b> of canopies acts as a selective UV-B filter, and thus prevents subcanopy thalli from exposure to harmful radiation. This was confirmed by the differences in photosynthetic activity, pigment composition, and concentration of RubisCO in thalli with different positions within the canopy. Additionally, the induction of the stress protein CPN 60 under UV exposure and low accumulation of DNA damage indicate the presence of physiological protection mechanisms against harmful UV-B. A mechanism of UV-B induced inhibition of photosynthesis under field conditions is proposed...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} fifty-two Golden-sex link (brown) hens in their 65 th week of lay {{were used in}} a study {{conducted}} to determine the oviposition time and interval, total egg production, clutch length and number of pause days of the birds under the humid tropical environment. The hens were also divided into four classes {{on the basis of}} their laying performances as follows: good layers, intermediate layers, poor layers and non layers and their physical conditions appraised. The birds were supplied water ad libitum and fed layers mash containing 16. 5 % crude protein and 9. 62 MJ/kg ME for 5 weeks. Results showed that the peak of lay was between 7. 30 - 8. 30 am and declined gradually until only one egg was laid between 3. 30 - 4. 30 pm. About 66. 36 % and 33. 64 % of the eggs were laid in the morning hours and in the afternoon hours, respectively. The mean oviposition interval was 26. 61 h, while the average laying intensity was 48. 90 %. About 98 % of the clutch lengths were of 5 cycle lengths and below, with the highest frequency of occurrence being 1 cycle length. The total number of pause days over all birds was 558 days. Hens with the longest clutches and shortest number of pause days produced the greatest number of eggs. Observation made on the physical characteristics revealed that good layers had smooth and waxy comb and wattles. The vents were moist and enlarged with flexible pubic bone, soft abdomen and worn out feathers. Intermediate layers had similar features with the good layers except that eye rings, beaks and shanks were slightly <b>bleached.</b> Poor <b>layers</b> had dry combs and wattles; tight and hard abdomen and closed pubic bones. Non layers had scaly, dry and rough comb and wattles; dull eyes and rigid pubic bones which were relatively close together...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Portezuelo Formation {{is part of}} a red bed {{sequence}} in the Neuquen Basin assigned to the Neuquen Group (lower Cenomanian middle Campanian). In outcrops of the Portezuelo Formation in the Barda Gonzalez region, iron oxide and hydroxide cements are only preserved in the less permeable claystone layers. Paleomigration of hydrocarbons and formation waters along the most permeable <b>layers</b> <b>bleached</b> the rocks due to partial to total dissolution of cements and grains and formation of several authigenic minerals: (1) montmorillonite and pyrite in the medium- to fine-grained sandstones and mudstones, and (2) multistage calcite and pyrite in the coarse-grained sandstones and conglomerates. The delta(ScDT) -Sc- 34 (Canyon Diablo troilite) of - 24. 4 to 60 % 0 values in pyrite point to microbial reduction of a sulfate precursor. The oxidation of hydrocarbons and fluctuations in pH and carbon dioxide pressure caused by organic acids resulted in multiple stages of dissolution and precipitation of calcite. Calcite crystals host hydrocarbon-bearing fluid inclusions (+/- pyrite) with variable fluorescence color, indicating that hydrocarbon composition changed with time. The intermediate delta(CpDB) -Cp- 13 (Peedee belemnite) (- 8. 11 % 0 to 8. 52700) and delta(18) opDB(9. 76 to 9. 83700) isotope composition of calcites may have resulted from mixtures of C- 13 -rich CO 2 after the dissolution of local calcrete with C- 13 -poor CO 2 from oxidizing hydrocarbons. This contribution provides for the first time key information to predict the distribution of authigenic minerals in reservoir rocks in the basin and improves understanding of the diagenetic history of the Portezuelo Formation...|$|R
40|$|In the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor), in-vessel {{components}} such as {{blanket and}} divertor, which are {{installed in the}} vacuum vessel of the ITER, are maintained by remote handling equipment (RH equipment). The RH equipment for maintenance is operated under sever environmental conditions, such as high temperature (50 approx 100 degC), high gamma-ray radiation (approx 1 kGy/h) {{in an atmosphere of}} inert gas or vacuum; therefore many components of the RH equipment must have a suitable radiation resistance efficiency for long time operation (10 approx 100 MGy). Typical components of the RH equipment have been extensively tested under an intensive gamma-ray radiation. Monitoring of the radiation dose of the components of the RH equipment is essential to control the operation period of the RH equipment considering radiation resistance. However, the maximum measurable radiation dose of the conventional dosimeters, such as ionization chamber, liquid, glass and plastic dosimeters are limited to be approximately 1 MGy which is too low to monitor the RH equipment for the ITER. In addition, these conventional dosimeters do not involve sufficient radiation resistance against the high gamma-ray radiation as well as are not easy handling and low cost. Based on the above backgrounds, a new dosimeter with bleaching of an azo group dye to be applied to a radiation monitor has been developed for high gamma-ray radiation use. The colored alumilite dosimeter is composed of the azo group dye (-N=N-) in an anodic oxidation layer of aluminum alloy (Al sub 2 O sub 3). It can monitor the radiation dose by measuring the change of the bleaching of azo dye in the Al sub 2 O sub 3 layer due to gamma-ray irradiation. The degree of bleaching is measured as the change of hue (color) and brightness based on the Munsell's colors with a three dimensional universe using spectrophotometer. In the tests, the dependencies such as colors, anodized layer thickness, type of azo dy of the crature and ultraviolet radiation were investigated using the various colored alumilite samples. The followings were clarified from the test results; - a red colored alumilite sample has shown remarkable bleaching change compared with blue and green colored alumilite samples, - the characteristic of bleaching depends on dose rate, - the degree of <b>bleaching</b> of thick-anodized <b>layer</b> sample is lower than that of thin- anodized <b>layer,</b> - the <b>bleaching</b> is activated under high temperature (over 75 degC), - there is no effect of ultraviolet radiation (310 approx 410 nm). As a whole, a red colored and a blue colored alumilite samples are suitable to measure under high dose rate and low dose rate conditions, respectively. For example, a red colored alumilite sample made of TAC-RED 105 dye with layer thickness of 25 mu m is measurable up to 70 MGy under high dose rate of 10 kGy/h. On the other hand, a blue colored alumilite sample made of TAC-BLUE RCD dye with layer thickness of 10 mu m is measurable up to 10 kGy under low dose rate of 2 Gy/h. In this paper, the outline of the colored alumilite dosimeter, bleaching mechanism, measurement method and details of the various test results are described...|$|R
