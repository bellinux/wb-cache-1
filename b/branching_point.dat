25|$|In a {{language}} with lazy evaluation, like Haskell, a list is evaluated {{only to the}} degree that its elements are requested: for example, if one asks for the first element of a list, only the first element will be computed. With respect to usage of the list monad for non-deterministic computation that means that we can non-deterministically generate a lazy list of all results of the computation and ask for the first of them, and only as much work will be performed as is needed to get that first result. The process roughly corresponds to backtracking: a path of computation is chosen, and then if it fails at some point (if it evaluates mzero), then it backtracks to the last <b>branching</b> <b>point,</b> and follows the next path, and so on. If the second element is then requested, it again does just enough work to get the second solution, and so on. So the list monad is a simple way to implement a backtracking algorithm in a lazy language.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} recent experiment demonstrates {{several aspects of}} bee learning. Foragers were trained to enter a simple Y-shaped maze that had been marked at the entrance with a particular color. Inside the maze was a <b>branching</b> <b>point</b> where the bee was required to choose between two paths. One path, {{which led to the}} food reward, was marked with the same color that had been used {{at the entrance to the}} maze, while the other was marked with a different color. Foragers learned to choose the correct path, and continued to do so when a different kind of marker (black and white stripes oriented in various directions) was substituted for the colored markers. When the experimental conditions were reversed, rewarding bees for choosing the inner passage marked with a symbol that was different from the entrance symbol, the bees again learned to choose the correct path. Variations in the length of the tunnel between the stimulus markers showed that bees retain information in working memory for about 5 seconds, equivalent to the short-term memory of birds. Altogether, the experiments demonstrated that bees can to choose between alternatives, determine if a stimulus is the same or different than one seen earlier, remember the earlier one for a short period, and generalize this performance to new pairs of stimuli.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Branch</b> <b>points</b> {{fall into}} three broad categories: {{algebraic}} <b>branch</b> <b>points,</b> transcendental <b>branch</b> <b>points,</b> and logarithmic <b>branch</b> <b>points.</b> Algebraic <b>branch</b> <b>points</b> most commonly arise from functions {{in which there}} is an ambiguity in the extraction of a root, such as solving the equation w2 [...] = z for w as a function of z. Here the <b>branch</b> <b>point</b> is the origin, because the analytic continuation of any solution around a closed loop containing the origin will result in a different function: there is non-trivial monodromy. Despite the algebraic <b>branch</b> <b>point,</b> the function w is well-defined as a multiple-valued function and, in an appropriate sense, is continuous at the origin. This is in contrast to transcendental and logarithmic <b>branch</b> <b>points,</b> that is, points at which a multiple-valued function has nontrivial monodromy and an essential singularity. In geometric function theory, unqualified use of the term <b>branch</b> <b>point</b> typically means the former more restrictive kind: the algebraic <b>branch</b> <b>points.</b> [...] In other areas of complex analysis, the unqualified term may also refer to the more general <b>branch</b> <b>points</b> of transcendental type.|$|R

40|$|For {{branched}} polymers, the {{curvilinear motion}} of the <b>branch</b> <b>point</b> along the backbone is a significant relaxation source but details of this motion have not been well understood. This study conducts multi-chain sliplink simulations to examine effects of the spatial fluctuation and curvilinear hopping of the <b>branch</b> <b>point</b> on the viscoelastic relaxation. The simulation {{is based on the}} primitive chain network model that allows the spatial fluctuations of sliplink and <b>branch</b> <b>point</b> and the chain sliding along the backbone according to the subchain tension, chemical potential gradients, drag force against medium, and random force. The sliplinks are created and/or disrupted through the motion of chain ends. The curvilinear hopping of the <b>branch</b> <b>point</b> along the backbone is allowed to occur when all sliplinks on a branched arm are lost. The simulations considering the fluctuation and the hopping of the <b>branch</b> <b>point</b> described well the viscoelastic data for symmetric and asymmetric star polymers with a parameter set common to the linear polymer. On the other hand, the simulations without the <b>branch</b> <b>point</b> motion predicted unreasonably slow relaxation for asymmetric star polymers. For asymmetric star polymers, further tests with and without the <b>branch</b> <b>point</b> hopping revealed that the hopping is much less important compared to the <b>branch</b> <b>point</b> fluctuation when the lengths of the short and long backbone arms are not very different and the waiting time for the <b>branch</b> <b>point</b> hopping (time for removal of all sliplinks on the short arm) is larger than the backbone relaxation time. Although this waiting time changes with the hopping condition, the above results suggest a significance of the <b>branch</b> <b>point</b> fluctuation in the actual relaxation of branch polymers...|$|R

While there are 24 endings available, many endings are inaccessible initially and must be unlocked by experiencing events or learning information in other plotlines.

500|$|He concludes {{this final}} section by {{fleshing}} out his Proavis and summarizing {{his view of}} bird origins, in which birds would have departed from reptiles at the pseudosuchians. From this <b>branching</b> <b>point,</b> birds and dinosaurs would have evolved along parallel evolutionary tracks for millions of years, as cousins rather than ancestors. He imagines that these reptiles would have gradually assumed a bipedal gait, and transformed eventually from terrestrial runners to arboreal climbers, developing leaping capabilities ever increasing in length. Along the way, the ancestral reptilian scales would have become [...] "frayed" [...] and gradually developed into feathers, beginning along the forearm and tail and gradually spreading to the entire body. The need for this animal to be an adept climber would have catalyzed the lengthening of its phalanges, which would eventually become long and strong enough to support a wing. Powerful muscles would have developed to anchor these limbs, which would have reacted upon the breastbone. All of this together would have facilitated the origin of an accelerated metabolic rate, resulting in the warm-blooded state known of modern birds. This development would have occurred alongside of the enlargement of the brain, needed to coordinate and supervise these refined features. It is in this way, Heilmann concludes, the reptile has been changed into a bird.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Improved {{ultrasound}} and needle technology make popliteal {{sciatic nerve}} blockade a popular anesthetic technique and imaging to localize the <b>branch</b> <b>point</b> {{of the common}} peroneal and posterior tibial components is important because successful blockade techniques vary with respect to injection of the common trunk proximally or separate injections distally. Nerve stimulation, ultrasound, cadaveric and magnetic resonance studies demonstrate variability in distance and discordance between imaging and anatomic examination of the <b>branch</b> <b>point.</b> The popliteal crease and imprecise, inaccessible landmarks render measurement of the <b>branch</b> <b>point</b> variable and inaccurate. The {{purpose of this study}} was to use the tibial tuberosity, a fixed bony reference, to measure the distance of the <b>branch</b> <b>point.</b> Method: During popliteal sciatic nerve blockade in the supine position the <b>branch</b> <b>point</b> was identified by ultrasound and the block needle was inserted. The vertical distance from the tibial tuberosity prominence and needle insertion point was measured. Results: In 92 patients the <b>branch</b> <b>point</b> is a mean distance of 12. 91 cm proximal to the tibial tuberosity and more proximal in male (13. 74 cm) than female patients (12. 08 cm). Body height is related to the <b>branch</b> <b>point</b> distance and is more proximal in taller patients. Separation into two nerve branches during local anesthetic injection supports notions of more proximal neural anatomic division. Limitations: Imaging of the sciatic nerve division may not equal its true anatomic separation.
