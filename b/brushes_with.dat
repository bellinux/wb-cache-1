5|$|During {{his time}} at the Bar, Hastings was {{involved}} in a variety of libel cases and in a divorce case which significantly changed the law relating to the admission of evidence from spouses regarding the legitimacy or illegitimacy of a child. His first significant libel case was Siever v Wootton. Robert Sievier was a well-known horse racing journalist and owner with a reputation for <b>brushes</b> <b>with</b> the law and underhanded dealings, having previously been tried for blackmail and acquitted on a technicality. In 1913 he accused Richard Wootton, a noted trainer of racehorses, of ordering his jockeys to withdraw from races if he had bet on another horse so as to allow him to make large amounts of money. Wootton sued him for libel and won, but was granted only a symbolic farthing in damages because the jury thought that Sievier had not intended to cause harm. As a result of this pyrrhic victory, Wootton held a grudge against Sievier for many years.|$|E

25|$|Aerobraking {{allows a}} {{spacecraft}} {{to reduce the}} high point of an elliptical orbit by repeated <b>brushes</b> <b>with</b> the atmosphere at the low point of the orbit. This can save a considerable amount of fuel because it takes much less delta-V to enter an elliptical orbit compared to a low circular orbit. Because the braking is done over the course of many orbits, heating is comparatively minor, and a heat shield is not required. This has been done on several Mars missions such as Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and at least one Venus mission, Magellan.|$|E

Believing that he was {{miraculously}} cured of rheumatism, he became devoutly religious, and developed beliefs that conflicted with the catechism of the Lutheran Church of Sweden. He believed in the supremacy of the Bible and was arrested several times by the authorities for burning the works of Luther and others in public and encouraging his followers to do the same. From 1844, he {{claimed to be a}} true prophet speaking the word of God. After repeated <b>brushes</b> <b>with</b> the law in Sweden, and having outraged members of the Church of Sweden, he departed for the United States in 1846, condemning his homeland to eternal damnation and taking 1,200—1,500 followers with him.|$|E
25|$|Cole has had {{a couple}} of minor <b>brushes</b> <b>with</b> the police. On 4 March 2009 he was held after {{swearing}} in front of a police officer outside a South Kensington nightclub. He was taken to a police station and issued with an £80 Fixed Penalty Notice before being released. On 4 January 2010, Cole was convicted of a speeding offence committed on 17 November 2009. He was recorded exceeding the speed limit by doing 104mph in a 50mph zone on the A3 road in Kingston upon Thames, a residential stretch. His defence at Kingston Magistrates Court, opposing the charge in his absence, argued unsuccessfully that the police speed gun was faulty. Cole also claimed that his actions were excuseable because he was trying to evade the paparazzi. On 29 January he was fined £1000 and disqualified from driving for four months.|$|E
25|$|Christie had {{a lifelong}} {{interest}} in archaeology. She met her second husband, Sir Max Mallowan, a distinguished archaeologist, {{on a trip}} to the excavation site at Ur in 1930. But her fame as an author far surpassed his fame in archaeology. Prior to meeting Mallowan, Christie had not had any extensive <b>brushes</b> <b>with</b> archaeology, but once the two married, they made sure to only go to sites where they could work together. Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending 3–4 months at a time in Syria and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, Nineveh, Tell Arpachiyah, Chagar Bazar, Tell Brak, and Nimrud. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.|$|E

500|$|The cleanup was {{hampered}} by two significant factors: the unexpected base surge {{and the lack}} of a viable cleanup plan. [...] It was understood that if the water column fell back into the lagoon, which it did, any ships that were drenched by falling water might be contaminated beyond redemption. Nobody expected that to happen to almost the entire target fleet. [...] No decontamination procedures had been tested in advance to see if they would work and to measure the potential risk to personnel. [...] In the absence of a decontamination protocol, the ships were cleaned using traditional deck-scrubbing methods: hoses, mops, and <b>brushes,</b> <b>with</b> water, soap, and lye.

500|$|McCain {{decided to}} run for United States Senator from Arizona in 1986, when {{longtime}} American conservative icon and Arizona fixture Barry Goldwater retired. [...] No Republican would oppose McCain in the primary, and according to his press secretary Torie Clarke, McCain's political strength convinced his most formidable possible Democratic opponent, Governor Bruce Babbitt, not to run for the seat. [...] Instead McCain faced a weaker opponent, former state legislator Richard Kimball, a young politician with an offbeat personality who slept on his office floor and whom McCain's allies in the Arizona press characterized as having [...] "terminal weirdness."

500|$|The canvas is {{dramatically}} divided in two by a diagonal line separated by colour and tone. The lower two-thirds {{are dominated by}} heavy red and white pigments; browns and whites are prominent in the upper right-hand section. This division is delineated by a diagonal reaching from the upper edge of the curtain down to Ottavio's leggings in the right mid-ground. Other echoes of the colours and patterns include the red of Paul's robes against the velvet of his chair and the overhanging curtain. This dramatic colour and luminosity can be in part attributed to this design, and to {{the manner in which}} Titian reverses the usual painterly technique in building tone: he began with a dark background, then layered the lighter hues before the darker passages. The effect {{has been described as a}} [...] "tour de force of symphonic colourism", and a high point of his blending of red and ochre pigments. Titian uses a variety of brushstrokes. While the pope's robes are painted with very broad strokes, his cape (mozzetta), ageing face and visible hand were captured in minute detail with thin <b>brushes,</b> <b>with</b> his hairs rendered at the level of individual strands.|$|E

500|$|Miller {{was invited}} to join a RAAF team in London. The team was officially formed in {{preparation}} for the 1943 season and Miller's selection let to the first of many <b>brushes</b> <b>with</b> death: in April, while away with the team, some of his comrades were killed in a German air strike. Miller played his first match at Lord's against Warner's XI, a team that featured past, current and future England players, including Bob Wyatt, Gubby Allen, Trevor Bailey and Alec Bedser. Miller top-scored in the first innings with 45 and added 21 not out, with two sixes, in the second innings. The RAAF played eight matches that season and Miller's top score was 141 against Public School Wanderers. He went on to play for Dominions against Warner's XI in August, scoring 32 and two. The match marked the first meeting between Miller and his good friend, England batsman Denis Compton and his bowling began to attract media attention. In the final match of the season at Lord's between the RAAF and the Royal Air Force, Miller took 3/23 and scored 91. The success of RAAF and Dominions that season, especially the attractive batting by Miller and Keith Carmody, prompted Warner to begin planning for a [...] "Test" [...] series between the respective armed services of England and Australia.|$|E

John Shiban developed {{the idea for a}} Mulder–Scully kiss, which was described by series creator Chris Carter as a [...] "present for the fans."

Gillian Anderson later explained that, [...] "David [...] and I knew the kiss was coming. [...] I felt the editors of that episode milked it in a very effective way." [...] In order to create the atmosphere of the scene, specialized camera angles were used and everything was slowed down to make the scene last longer. The Millennium Ball scene was digitally created on a computer because the episode was filmed in October, two months before the event was scheduled to take place. Special effects producer Bill Millar was tasked with digitally adding the number [...] "2000" [...] into archival footage of Dick Clark's 1999 New Years Eve show.

40|$|Background: Dental plaque {{contributes}} to caries and periodontal disease, therefore efficient plaque removal promotes oral health. We hypothesize that individuals <b>brushing</b> <b>with</b> toothpaste containing plaque-indicating dye will demonstrate higher plaque removal efficacy than those using conventional toothpaste. This study tested plaque removal efficacy between a novel FDA-registered toothpaste with plaque-indicating dye and a control toothpaste without indicating dye. Methods: Thirty-one adult participants {{enrolled in the}} study were randomized and divided into two groups. Control group participants <b>brushed</b> <b>with</b> control toothpaste for two visits. Experimental group participants <b>brushed</b> <b>with</b> control toothpaste for their first visit and <b>brushed</b> <b>with</b> experimental toothpaste (PlaqueHDTM, TJA Health LLC, Joliet, Illinois) for their second visit. Participants brushed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Prior to all visits, participants discontinued oral hygiene for 12 - 16 hours. After <b>brushing,</b> participants rinsed <b>with</b> fluorescein solution and intraoral photographs were taken using an ultraviolet digital camera. The presence of plaque on tooth surfaces was visualized by plaque-bound fluorescein and quantified. Images from both visits were compared using custom software to calculate percentage-change of remaining plaque. Statistics (SPSS version 22. 0) were performed to compare plaque reduction between groups. Results: Participants using the experimental toothpaste demonstrated significantly less plaque remaining between visits (51. 3 % reduction, p= 0. 015) than participants using only the placebo toothpaste (8. 3 % reduction, p= 0. 189). Conclusions: Mechanical plaque removal by <b>brushing</b> <b>with</b> toothpaste containing plaque-indicating dye significantly reduced plaque compared to <b>brushing</b> <b>with</b> toothpaste without dye. This innovative dentifrice may improve oral hygiene and reduce plaque-related damages to teeth and oral tissues...|$|R
