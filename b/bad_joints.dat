6000|$|And Emil Gluck {{chuckled and}} went his way. He knew. But {{how was the}} world to know? He had {{stumbled}} upon the secret in his old electroplating shop on Telegraph Avenue {{in the city of}} Oakland. It happened, at that time, that a wireless telegraph station was established by the Thurston Power Company close to his shop. In a short time his electroplating vat was put out of order. The vat- wiring had many <b>bad</b> <b>joints,</b> and, on investigation, Gluck discovered minute welds at the joints in the wiring. These, by lowering the resistance, had caused an excessive current to pass through the solution, [...] "boiling" [...] it and spoiling the work. But what had caused the welds? was the question in Gluck's mind. His reasoning was simple. Before the establishment of the wireless station, the vat had worked well. Not until after the establishment of the wireless station had the vat been ruined. Therefore the wireless station had been the cause. But how? He quickly answered the question. If an electric discharge was capable of operating a coherer across three thousand miles of ocean, then, certainly, the electric discharges from the wireless station four hundred feet away could produce coherer effects on the <b>bad</b> <b>joints</b> in the vat-wiring.|$|E
50|$|ENIAC {{could be}} {{programmed}} to perform complex sequences of operations, including loops, branches, and subroutines. However, instead of the stored program computers that exist today, ENIAC was just a large collection of arithmetic machines, which had programs hard coded into the machines with function tables that each contained 1200 ten way switches. The task of taking a problem and mapping it onto the machine was complex, and usually took weeks. Due {{to the complexity of}} mapping programs onto the machine, programs were only changed after huge numbers of tests of the current program. After the program was figured out on paper, the process of getting the program into ENIAC by manipulating its switches and cables could take days. This was followed by a period of verification and debugging, aided by the ability to execute the program step by step. A programming tutorial for the modulo function using an ENIAC simulator gives an impression of what a program on the ENIAC looked like.ENIAC's six primary programmers, Kay McNulty, Betty Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas and Ruth Lichterman, not only determined how to input ENIAC programs, but also developed an understanding of ENIAC's inner workings.

40|$|Carton board {{packages}} are often closed with an adhesive. The adhesive joint thus formed has {{to meet the}} demands during the entire product life from converting to end-use. The adhesive joint has to be characterized if it is good or bad for the actual application. Today such characterization is done by manually peeling the joint, immediately after the adhesive application in the gluing machine. The manual peel test is a subjective test that is operator dependent. An operator needs long experience to be able to perform a manual peel test. Therefore, the packaging industry is interested in a test method that can objectively predict good or <b>bad</b> adhesive <b>joints.</b> The adhesive joints have been tested in the so-called Y-peel test arrangement. An advantage of the Y-peel test is that it gives an objective result from the force–elongation curve. Testing has been performed with carton boards of two different thicknesses. Hotmelt adhesive was used and the open time was varied in the glue applicator. It was found that the Y-peel test gives results in qualitative agreement with the manual peel test. Moreover, by evaluating the energy consumption (dissipative energy) during the Y-peel test it was possible to obtain not only a qualitative but also a quantitative assessment of the adhesive joint...|$|R

It is expected to render a decision within 3 : 2 μs, which necessitates an implementation using custom hardware. The implementation makes heavy use of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology to reconcile the performance requirements with the need for exibility.

While equity returns show strong evidence of asymmetries in conditional volatility, little is found for bond returns.

40|$|The role of {{mechanical}} factors in driving osteoarthritis is undisputed, but historically this was largely explained by chronic attrition of the articulating surfaces.

40|$|Clinical {{mobility}} {{assessment is}} traditionally performed in laboratories using complex and expensive equipment. The low accessibility to such equipment, {{combined with the}} emerging trend to assess mobility in a free-living environment, creates a need for body-worn sensors (e. g., inertial measurement units—IMUs) {{that are capable of}} measuring the complexity in motor performance using meaningful measurements, such as joint orientation. However, accuracy of joint orientation estimates using IMUs may be affected by environment, the joint tracked, type of motion performed and velocity. This study investigates a quality control (QC) process to assess the quality of orientation data based on features extracted from the raw inertial sensors’ signals. Joint orientation (trunk, hip, knee, ankle) of twenty participants was acquired by an optical motion capture system and IMUs during a variety of tasks (sit, sit-to-stand transition, walking, turning) performed under varying conditions (speed, environment). An artificial neural network was used to classify good and <b>bad</b> sequences of <b>joint</b> orientation with a sensitivity and a specificity above 83 %.

Here we introduce a directional distance function {{and use it as}} a component in a new productivity index. This index, as an empirical example shows, seems to solve the problem caused by the joint production of good and bad outputs. PRODUCTIVITY AND UNDESIRABLE OUTPUTS: A DIRECTIONAL DISTANCE FUNCTION APPROACH by Yangho Chung and Rolf Färe* Undesirable outputs are often produced jointly with desirable outputs, i. e., good output cannot be produced without producing some <b>bad</b> output. This <b>joint</b> production of good and bad outputs has gained attention in the literature on efficiency and productivity. 1 One can distinguish between two lines of inquiry: (i) how to model joint production of good and bad outputs and (ii) how to account for reductions of bad outputs. The first issue is fairly well understood, but the second has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. To model joint production it is usually assumed that outputs are weakly disposable as defined by Shephard (1970). This means that if a given output vector is feasible, i. e., it can be produced using some input vector, then any proportional reduction of that output vector is also feasible. If in addition to weak disposability one assumes that the good outputs are nulljoint with the bad, 2 i. e., zero production of bad outputs is feasible only if good outputs are zero, then the joint production of good and bad outputs are quite well modelled...|$|R
