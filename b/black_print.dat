2500|$|Chromolithography {{became the}} most {{successful}} of several methods of colour printing developed by the 19th century; other methods were developed by printers such as Jacob Christoph Le Blon, George Baxter and Edmund Evans, and mostly relied on using several woodblocks with the colors. Hand-coloring also remained important; elements of the official British Ordnance Survey maps were colored by hand by boys until 1875. [...] Chromolithography developed from lithography and the term covers various types of lithography that are printed in color. The initial technique involved {{the use of multiple}} lithographic stones, one for each color, and was still extremely expensive when done for the best quality results. Depending on the number of colors present, a chromolithograph could take months to produce, by very skilled workers. [...] However much cheaper prints could be produced by simplifying both the number of colors used, and the refinement of the detail in the image. [...] Cheaper images, like the advertisement illustrated, relied heavily on an initial <b>black</b> <b>print</b> (not always a lithograph), on which colors were then overprinted. To make an expensive reproduction print as what was once referred to as a [...] "’chromo’", a lithographer, with a finished painting in front of him, gradually created and corrected the many stones using proofs to look as much as possible like the painting in front of him, sometimes using dozens of layers.|$|E

60|$|He {{returned}} to his empty chair, his half consumed whisky and soda, his vellum-bound volume, carefully marked. Somehow or other, the echoes of his last words seemed to be ringing in his ears. The fire had burned a little low, the sound of passing vehicles from outside had grown fainter and fainter. He took up his book, threw himself into his chair, gazed with vacant eyes at the thick <b>black</b> <b>print.</b> There was a sudden chill in his heart, a sudden thought, perhaps a fear. There was one way through which loneliness could come.|$|E
