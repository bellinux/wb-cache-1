In this letter, we derive a framework for climate-smart land management in the Atlantic climate zone of the EU by combining the results from five component research studies on various aspects of the carbon cycle. We show that the options for proactive management of soil organic carbon differ according to soil type and that a spatially tailored approach to land management will be more effective than <b>blanket</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R

30|$|This study {{addresses}} the highlighted gaps by investigating {{the levels of}} financial development for which an increase in information-sharing bureaus can most enhance financial access. The interest in considering initial levels of financial development arises because the findings of Asongu et al. (2016) {{were based on the}} average values of financial development. It is important to include countries with low, intermediate, and high levels of financial development in the modeling exercise, because <b>blanket</b> <b>policies</b> based on the mean values of financial access may not succeed unless they are contingent on initial levels of financial development and tailored differently across countries with different levels of financial access (see Henderson et al. 2013). In the light of the above insights, the quantile regression empirical strategy is adopted, because existing studies on information sharing have examined the relationship between information-sharing bureaus and financial development using parameter estimates based on the conditional means of financial development variables (Triki and Gajigo 2014; Asongu et al. 2016).|$|R
50|$|Arkansas Time After Time's {{goal is to}} {{help make}} {{communities}} safer and to protect children. In order to do this, it aims to educate the public and legislators to differentiate between those truly dangerous repeat violent sexual predators and those who at some time in their past committed a sex-related offense, served their sentence, completed or are currently undergoing treatment, and are working to re-integrate into society. ATAT holds that public registries have gone far beyond their original intent of protecting children and tracking violent sexual predtors. It lobbies for fact based sex offender registry and policies to take account these differences instead of emotion based policies that may do more harm than good, and seeks to educate law-makers and the public of the stigma and other adverse effects some registrants and their families are unnecessarily experiencing due to current <b>blanket</b> <b>policies.</b> ATAT holds that current public registries are not effective and put registrants and their families in danger of vigilante attacks.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} previously missing financial components(efficiency, {{activity and}} size) {{in the assessment}} of the finance-investment nexus. Using VAR models in the perspectives of VECM and short-run Granger causality, three broad findings are established: (1) while finance led investment elasticities are positive, investment elasticities of finance are negative; (2) but for Guinea Bissau, Mozambique and Togo, finance does not seem to engender portfolio investment; (3) contrary to mainstream literature, financial efficiency appears to impact investment more than financial depth. Four policy implications result: (1) extreme caution is needed in the use of single equation analysis for economic forecasts; (2) financial development leads more to investment flows than the other way round; (3) financial allocation efficiency is more relevant as means to attracting investment flows than financial depth; (4) the somewhat heterogeneous character of the findings also point to shortcomings in <b>blanket</b> <b>policies</b> that are not contingent on country-specific trends in the finance-investment nexus. ...|$|R

While enterprise grids exist within organizations, national grids have become common, usually consisting of government {{as well as}} academic facilities. Such facilities are not uncommonly lenient with <b>blanket</b> <b>policies</b> to allow inbound and outbound grid traffic. This is far from ideal, from a security perspective, but given the dynamic nature of grid use, it is impractical to keep restrictive firewalls and manually keep up with on-demand firewall reconfiguration. Other solutions are necessary, where security is not sacrificed. Apart from first generation solutions that were mostly not sufficiently generic, standardization work is now ongoing, but exclusively aimed at firewall virtualization. We argue for an architectural solution that encompasses firewall virtualization {{as well as other}} methods that can be more appropriate in many environments.

40|$|This paper {{integrates}} {{two main}} strands of the aid-development nexus in providing additional {{information as to}} why institutional benchmarks (thresholds) matter for the effectiveness of aid in institutional development. Using seven government-quality dynamics (rule of law, regulation quality, government-effectiveness, political-stability, voice & accountability, corruption-control and democracy), we provide a thorough assessment of the aid-development nexus when existing institutional development levels matter. Results which are consistent across specifications and conditional distributions of institutional variables have three broad implications (with respect to three tested hypotheses). (1) Institutional benefits of foreign-aid are contingent on existing institutional levels in Africa. (2) But for a thin exception, foreign-aid is instrumental in institutional development for countries {{with low levels of}} institutional quality. (3) Institutional quality benefits of development assistance are questionable in countries with high levels of institutional development. As a <b>policy</b> implication, <b>blanket</b> <b>policies</b> based on the aid-development nexus are unlikely to be appropriate; therefore policy measures should be contingent on prevailing levels of institutional development and tailored differently across best and worst countries in terms of institutional development. ...|$|R

As of October 11, 15 of the lawsuits had been settled, 38 cities had avoided litigation by revoking their sex offender ordinances, and 6 cities had chosen to discontinue enforcing the ordinances. At the time, sex offender ordinances were under review in 18 additional cities. CA RSOLs efforts culminated in March 2015 when Supreme Court of California struck down part of the California Proposition 83 (2006) declaring San Diego Countys blanket residency restrictions imposed on all offender regardless of the facts of individual cases unconstitutional. Court cited restrictions unfairness and counterproductive effects, stating that <b>blanket</b> <b>policies</b> [...] "infringed their liberty and privacy interests, however limited, while bearing no rational relationship to advancing the state’s legitimate goal of protecting children from sexual predators."

40|$|Persistent lack {{of health}} {{insurance}} might arise from two distinct sources. First, individuals who lack insurance might possess certain traits, also exhibiting persistence, that associate with lower probabilities of having insurance. Second, persistence might arise if lack of insurance in the present period directly increases the probability of lacking insurance in future periods. This second channel, called "true state dependence", implies a causal mechanism from past uninsurance. State dependence can also arise if insurance status "feeds back" to future factors that affect insurance status in subsequent periods. This paper extends standard dynamic models to incorporate feedback from uninsurance to future health and employment. Results indicate that, after incorporating feedback effects, lacking insurance six months ago increases the probability of current uninsurance by 57 - 59 percentage points. Similarly, lacking insurance two years ago increases the probability of current uninsurance by 18 - 22 percentage points. The large estimates of state dependence suggest that future uninsurance can be effectively reduced by enacting <b>blanket</b> <b>policies</b> that increase insurance rates now. On the other hand, estimates also reveal that unmeasured heterogeneity contributes more to persistence than observed heterogeneity, especially in the long run. This finding draws into question the effectiveness of implementing new, or expanding upon existing, targeted reforms. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{remaining}} 21.3% of home {{insurance policies}} {{were covered by}} renter's or condominium insurance. 14.8% of these had the HO-4 Contents Broad form, also known as renters' insurance, which covers the contents of an apartment not specifically covered in the <b>blanket</b> <b>policy</b> written for the complex.

50|$|Employment {{discrimination}} against persons with criminal {{records in the}} United States has been illegal since passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Employers may lawfully consider an applicant's or employee's criminal conviction(s) for employment purposes e.g., hiring, retention, promotion, benefits, and delegated duties. That said, <b>blanket</b> <b>policies</b> or practices e.g., exclusion of all job applicants with convictions from hiring may violate the Act due to the disparate impact on some minorities protected by the act who might have as a subpopulation higher rates of criminal convictions and arrests. Likewise, policies or practices that are not sufficiently narrowly tailored for legitimate business necessity may be violations of the Act - if the discriminatory treatment or impact falls predominately upon those persons protected by the Act. Title VII applies to businesses with more than 15 employees and defines two types of discrimination, disparate treatment and disparate impact. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has been enforcing Title VII since it came into effect in 1965. It has periodically issued an enforcement guidance explaining how employers could use criminal records without violating the Civil Rights Act; in April 2012 it published an enforcement guidance requiring companies to establish procedures {{to show that they}} are not using criminal records to discriminate by race or national origin.The size of the problem is unknown.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} global trajectories, dynamics, and tendencies of {{software}} piracy {{to ease the}} benchmarking of current efforts towards harmonizing the standards and enforcements of Intellectual Property Rights (henceforth IPRs) protection worldwide. Our empirical exercise is based on 15 different panel regressions, which together consists of 99 countries. The richness of the dataset allows us to disaggregate countries into fundamental characteristics of business software piracy based on income-levels (high-income, lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income and low-income), legal-origins (English common-law, French civil-law, German civil-law and, Scandinavian civil-law) and, regional proximity (South Asia, Europe & Central Asia, East Asia & the Pacific, Middle East & North Africa, Latin America & the Caribbean and, Sub-Saharan Africa). Our main finding suggest that, a genuine timeframe for standardizing IPRs laws {{in the fight against}} software piracy is most feasible within a horizon of 4. 3 to 10. 4 years. In other words, full (100 %) convergence within the specified timeframe will mean the enforcements of IPRs regimes without distinction of nationality or locality within identified fundamental characteristics of software piracy. The absence of convergence (in absolute and conditional terms) for the World panel indicates that, <b>blanket</b> <b>policies</b> may not be effective unless they are contingent on the prevailing trajectories, dynamics and tendencies of software piracy.
