25|$|The JG {{is based}} on a <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> {{principle}} whereby the public sector offers a fixed wage job to anyone willing and able to work thereby establishing and maintaining a <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> of employed workers.

25|$|The {{economic}} policy stance currently dominant {{around the world}} uses unemployment as a policy tool to control inflation; when cost pressures rise, the standard monetary policy {{carried out by the}} monetary authority (central bank) tightens interest rates, creating a <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> of unemployed people, which reduces wage demands, and ultimately inflation. When inflationary expectations subside, these people will get their jobs back. In Marxian terms, the unemployed serve as a reserve army of labor. By contrast, in a job guarantee program, a <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> of employed people (employed in the job guarantee program) provides the same protection against inflation without the social costs of unemployment, hence potentially fulfilling the dual mandate of full employment and price stability.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary action}} of buffer stocks, {{creating}} price stability, is often {{combined with other}} mechanisms to meet other goals such as the promotion of domestic industry. That is achieved by setting a minimum price for a certain product above the equilibrium price, {{the point at which}} the supply and demand curves cross, which guarantees a minimum price to producers, encouraging them to produce more and thus creating a surplus ready to be used as a <b>buffer</b> <b>stock.</b> The price stability itself may also tempt firms into the market, further boosting supply.|$|E

25|$|The fixed JG wage {{provides}} an in-built inflation control mechanism. Mitchell (1998) called {{the ratio of}} JG employment to total employment the buffer employment ratio (BER). The BER conditions the overall rate of wage demands. When the BER is high, real wage demands will be correspondingly lower. If inflation exceeds the government’s announced target, tighter fiscal and monetary policy would be triggered to increase the BER, which entails workers transferring from the inflating sector to the fixed price JG sector. Ultimately this attenuates the inflation spiral. So instead of a <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> of unemployed being used to discipline the distributional struggle, the JG policy achieves this via compositional shifts in employment. Replacing the current non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), the BER that results in stable inflation is called the non-accelerating inflation buffer employment ratio (NAIBER) (Mitchell 1998). It is a full employment steady state JG level, which is dependent {{on a range of}} factors including the path of the economy. There is an issue about the validity of an unchanging nominal anchor in an inflationary environment. The JG wage would be adjusted in line with productivity growth to avoid changing real relativities. Its viability as a nominal anchor relies on the fiscal authorities reining in any private wage-price pressures.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> schemes work {{along the}} same rough lines: first, two prices are determined, a floor and a ceiling (minimum and maximum price). When the price drops close to the floor price (after a new rich vein of silver is found, for example), the scheme {{operator}} (usually government) will start buying up the stock, ensuring that the price does not fall further. Likewise, when the price rises close to the ceiling, the operator depresses the price by selling off its holding. In the meantime, it must either store the commodity or otherwise {{keep it out of}} the market (for example, by destroying it). If a basket of commodities is stored, their price stabilization can in turn stabilize the overall price level, preventing inflation. This scenario is illustrated on the right. Taking the market for wheat as an example, here, in years with normal harvests (S1) the price is within the allowed range and the operator does not need to act. In bumper years (S3), however, the prices begins to fall, and the government must buy wheat to prevent the price from collapsing; likewise, in years with bad harvests (S2), the government must sell its stock to keep prices down. The result is far less fluctuation in price. Price stability then leads to greater joint welfare (the sum of consumer and producer surplus.|$|E

Besides that there are various methods that could eliminate a bottleneck by shifting that bottleneck to another process and help achieve output goals such as regulating break times, effective planning on production schedule of sources (using proper queue discipline), using <b>buffer</b> <b>stocks,</b> and improve production processes by R&D studies, etc. In this context, production quantities are increased with two steps.

These extreme weather events have retarded the otherwise impressive progress India has made in agricultural production, particularly {{during the past two}} decades. Food security, based on adequate <b>buffer</b> <b>stocks</b> of foodgrains, is often threatened. For example, the drought of 1987 - 88 reduced the aggregate output of foodgrains to between 135 and 140 million tons, far below the expected output of between 157 and 162 million tons for normal and well-distributed rainfall. <b>Buffer</b> <b>stocks</b> were badly depleted.
