They believed Castor had used the turkey <b>baster</b> to force-feed him once he became too physically weak.|$|E

25|$|Weta {{coined the}} term bigature for the 72 large miniatures {{produced}} for the film, in reference to their extreme size. Such miniatures include the 1:4 scale for Helm's Deep, which alongside Khazad-dûm and Osgiliath, {{was one of the}} first built. Most sets were constructed to allow compositing with the models and matte paintings. Notable examples include the Argonath, Minas Tirith, the tower and caverns of Isengard, Barad-dûr, the trees of Lothlórien and Fangorn Forest and the Black Gate. Alex Funke led the motion control camera rigs, and John <b>Baster</b> and Mary Maclahlan led the building of the miniatures. The miniatures unit worked more than any other special effects crew, working over 1000 days. Often they held parties to celebrate each landmark, such as day 666. Their final shot was one of the Black Gate for the third film in November 2003.|$|E

Governor Theodor Seitz cancelled the protection treaty with the <b>Basters,</b> intending to attack Rehoboth. Van Wyk informed General Botha, who advised {{him to try to}} get the <b>Basters</b> out of the area. They started moving by wagons and taking large herds of livestock, with many <b>Basters</b> trying to reach the mountains. German attacks against <b>Basters</b> took place around the region.|$|R

A comparison of records suggests that in 1912, there were about 3,000 <b>Basters</b> in the Rehoboth District. Most <b>Basters</b> were concentrated in the Rehoboth Gebiet, where they lived under their own law.|$|R

25|$|In 2006, Anderson {{appeared}} in a MasterCard television commercial for Super Bowl XL. In it, he manages to cut the ropes binding him to a chair using a pine tree air freshener, uses an ordinary tube sock as the pulley for a zip-line, and somehow repairs and hot-wires a nonfunctional truck using a paper clip, ballpoint pen, rubber band, tweezers, nasal spray, and a turkey <b>baster.</b> In contrast to previous MasterCard commercials showing people making extravagant purchases to accomplish some mundane task, MacGyver is portrayed as escaping from some sort of deathtrap using less than $20 worth of common household items. The commercial ends by showing him purposefully buying an assortment of such things at a department store with his credit card (as a tongue-in-cheek explanation for how he seems to always have items he needs on hand no matter where he goes). Although the commercial implies that Anderson is portraying MacGyver, he is not identified.|$|E

2500|$|Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick and Chief Assistant District Attorney Christine Garvey {{argued that}} David Castor's [...] "suicide" [...] {{had never made}} sense {{given the lack of}} his {{fingerprints}} on the glass or container tainted with ethylene glycol, a toxic substance found in antifreeze, and the turkey <b>baster</b> found in the kitchen garbage bearing both ethylene glycol and his DNA. They felt that this suggested he was force-fed antifreeze. Given evidence of the evolution of David Castor's illness, they concluded that Castor had for four days fed her husband antifreeze through the <b>baster</b> before trying {{to make it look like}} a suicide. She had said that her husband got the idea to kill himself with antifreeze while both were watching a news report about Lynn Turner, who murdered two past lovers by using the poison.|$|E
50|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Great War, <b>Basters</b> applied to have their native land become a British Protectorate like Basutoland, but were turned down by South Africa.

The <b>Basters</b> were however increasingly used by the Germans to assist them in subjugating the indigenous inhabitants. The <b>Basters</b> were furthermore, by means of the Military Treaty of 26 July 1895, bound to do military service.

Santamaría started {{accompanying}} him on his congas, then his band joined in, and the small audience slowly got up from their tables and started dancing, laughing and having a great time. Santamaría later asked Hancock if he could record the tune. On December 17, 1962, Mongo Santamaría recorded a three-minute version, suitable for radio, where he joined timbalero Francisco [...] "Kako" [...] <b>Baster</b> in a cha-cha beat, while drummer Ray Lucas performed a backbeat. Santamaría included the track on his album Watermelon Man (1962). Santamaría's recording is sometimes considered the beginning of Latin boogaloo, a fusion of Afro-Cuban rhythms with those of R.|$|E

5000|$|The Nama {{sold the}} land around Rehoboth to an agent for the Dorsland Trekkers but, before the Boers could settle there, Imperial Germany claimed German South-West Africa as a colony. On 15 September 1885 van Wyk and the Germans signed a [...] "Treaty of Protection and Friendship;" [...] this {{permitted}} the <b>Basters</b> to retain a degree of autonomy in exchange for accepting colonial rule. As this treaty contained no sale of land but rather a recognition that the territory occupied by the <b>Basters</b> was theirs, no money was changing hands in the deal. Later in the Herero and Nama War of 1904-08, the <b>Basters</b> would side with the Germans against the native peoples. Not many <b>Basters</b> fought in the conflict.|$|R
5000|$|Through the 1870s, <b>Basters</b> of Rehoboth {{suffered}} frequent {{losses from}} their herds, with livestock raided and stolen by {{the much larger}} groups of surrounding Nama and Herero peoples, who were themselves in competition. In 1880 Jan Afrikaner gathered 600 men against the Herero, and different Nama groups mustered about 1,000 warriors, with the Herero fielding about the same number. <b>Basters</b> tried to make alliances to survive, as they were outnumbered by both sides. The wars continued until about 1884, and, while suffering losses, <b>Basters</b> continued.|$|R
50|$|A second Treaty {{concerning}} National Service of the Rehoboth <b>Basters</b> of 1895 {{established a}} small armed contingent among the <b>Basters,</b> which fought alongside German colonists and {{forces in a}} number of battles and skirmishes against indigenous peoples.

5000|$|Due to South African successes, the German {{officers}} {{advised the}} <b>Baster</b> Council {{that they were}} moving the prisoners of war and <b>Baster</b> guards to the north.

Learning of the planned deployment, the <b>Baster</b> guards advised the Council they would not go. Although negotiations were in process, they learned the trains were due to leave the next day, and the night of April 18, numerous Basters defected from German service, taking arms with them that they intended to turn in at Rehoboth. About 300 men set up defenses in two laagers. Learning of this, the Germans disarmed other <b>Baster</b> soldiers in other posts; in the process, one unarmed <b>Baster</b> was killed. Rehoboth was in an uproar, although leaders tried to meet with the Germans to resolve the issues.|$|E

Relations between Rehoboth and Germany remained close {{for more than twenty}} years but in 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, Germany's use of <b>Baster</b> soldiers to guard South African prisoners - contrary to the terms of their enlistment - led to armed revolt. German forces then attacked Rehoboth, committed atrocities against <b>Baster</b> civilians and attacked refugees encamped upon the mountain of Sam Khubis, but, despite repeated attacks and the use of superior weaponry, were unable to destroy the Basters' position.
