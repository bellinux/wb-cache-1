25|$|Designed by architects Feilden Clegg Bradley, the BRE offices aim {{to reduce}} energy {{consumption}} and CO2 emissions by 30% from current best practice guidelines and sustain comfortable environmental conditions {{without the use}} of air conditioning. The passive ventilation stacks, solar shading, and hollow concrete slabs with embedded under floor cooling are key features of this building. Ventilation and heating systems are controlled by the <b>building</b> <b>management</b> <b>system</b> (BMS) while a degree of user override is provided to adjust conditions to occupants' needs.|$|E
2500|$|The Solaire, {{the first}} green {{residential}} {{building in the}} United States, {{as well as the}} first residential high-rise building in New York City to be certified by the U.S. Green Building Council. Designed by Pelli Clarke Pelli and completed in 2003, it has been described as an [...] "environmentally-progressive residential tower". The Solaire is located at 20 River Terrace. The developer received funding from the State of New York, which was somewhat controversial as the developer was only required to agree to set aside 10% of the units as [...] "affordable housing" [...] or [...] "moderate income", rather than the usual 80:20 agreement. When the building opened, rents ranged from roughly $2,500 to $9,001 {{depending on the size of}} the unit. The building has been rated LEED Platinum. The energy conserving building design is 35% more energy-efficient than code requires, resulting in a 67% lower electricity demand during peak hours, resulting in, among other benefits, [...] lower electric bills for residents, photovoltaic panels converting sunlight to electricity, and a computerized <b>building</b> <b>management</b> <b>system</b> and environmentally responsible operating and maintenance practices.|$|E
