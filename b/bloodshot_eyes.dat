The demon is said to give a primary form and eight other manifestations. In most cases {{he is said to}} be a giant who towers over his human victims. In the primary form, his face is blue and splotched with blood. Red rays radiate from his <b>bloodshot</b> <b>eyes.</b> Blood pours from his {{nostrils}} and smoke billows from his ears. His mouth is filled with decomposing human flesh and his breath is foul. His entire body is coloured scarlet with dripping blood. He is closely associated with Mara, the demon king of death.|$|E

500|$|The {{experience}} saw {{a change}} in the dog, with Frank later writing, [...] "She wasn't that tame, obedient dog anymore, she was a skinny animal that kept herself alive through cunning and instinct." [...] Because of the remoteness of the work camp, she was at a reduced risk from the local population who Frank feared would eat her. Frank credited Judy with saving his life during his time spent there, [...] "She saved my life in so many ways. The greatest way of all was giving me a reason to live. All I had to do was look at her and into those weary, <b>bloodshot</b> <b>eyes</b> and I would ask myself: What would happen to her if I died? I had to keep going. Even if it meant waiting for a miracle." [...] A radarman named Tom Scott later wrote that Frank and Judy shared an unusual bond, with Frank able to send the dog into the jungle with a click and recall her with a whistle. On one occasion, Frank found Judy attempting to bury an elephant's leg bone.|$|E

500|$|Because of {{the hard}} work by Anthem, the {{producers}} made [...] "Kush" [...] and [...] "Requiem" [...] into bottle episodes, to give the visual effects team a break. Instead, other forms of special effects were used. To create the Himalayan feel of [...] "Kush", the production crew used wind machines and paper snow. However, the fake snow became {{a problem for the}} cast, as they suffered from <b>bloodshot</b> <b>eyes</b> and scratchy throats when exposed to it. Aquariums were placed outside each port hole of the set in [...] "Requiem". To complete the effects where Druitt teleports, Heyerdahl would walk out of the shot while every other cast member has to stay still, until the directors signal them to react; the shot of Heyerdahl walking out of frame would later be cut. Another effect involving Heyerdahl is a scene between both his characters, Bigfoot and Druitt, in [...] "Revelations". To complete the shot, Heyerdahl had to film two different shots: one with him as Druitt talking to nothing, and another with him as Bigfoot talking to nothing. When both characters can be seen walking together, a stand-in would replace Heyerdahl as Bigfoot.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} known motion pictures to introduce the use of contact lenses as a make-up artist's device for enhancing the eyes was by the innovative actor Lon Chaney in the 1926 film The Road to Mandalay to create {{the effect of a}} character who had a blind eye. Dr. Rueben Greenspoon applied them to Orson Welles for the film Citizen Kane in 1940. [...] In the 1950s, contact lenses were starting to be used in British color horror films. An early example of this is the British actor Christopher Lee as the Dracula character in the 1958 color horror film Dracula, which helped to emphasize his horrific looking black pupils and red <b>bloodshot</b> <b>eyes.</b> Tony Curtis wore them in the 1968 film The Boston Strangler. Contact lenses were also used to better emphasize the sinister gaze of the demonic characters in 1968's Rosemary's Baby and 1973's The Exorcist. Colored custom-made contact lenses are now standard makeup for a number of special effects-based movies.|$|E
2500|$|Abe's appearance, {{resembling}} {{that of a}} grey alien, includes large bulbous eyes, large forehead, {{a skinny}} frame, and a bald head with a tuft of hair. His depiction is humorous. Despite his unusual appearance, which is unlike the [...] "typically cute" [...] platform characters, Abe appeals {{to a wide range}} of video game players. His design was meant to look downtrodden, but optimistic. Unlike other Mudokons, Abe has blue or purplish-green skin, <b>bloodshot</b> <b>eyes,</b> and a high ponytail. The stitches on his lips were given to him because he cried excessively after birth and they were a measure to keep him quiet, though he keeps them now because they were given to him at such a young age before he was [...] "awake enough, conscious enough as a person to really understand why he had these, but it's something that he feels is a part of him, so he doesn't want to snip loose". His skin has three mystical tattoos that grow over his body gradually: one on the back of each hand and one on his chest. Mudokon spirits have given him invisibility for short periods; he is sometimes able to incarnate the Mudokon god Shrykull; and background Mudokons assist him with other powers.|$|E

2500|$|When Jackson {{was hired}} to reprise the role in 2009, his return was highly anticipated, but {{accompanied}} by controversy as Vaughan was let go {{in order to bring}} Jackson back. Fans had a bittersweet reaction to the switch. The network promoted Jackson's return with the phrase, [...] "Elizabeth's first love is back!", which angered some of Vaughan's fans. However, ratings rose the week Jackson returned, and his performance was well received. Jackson was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2010, only having been with the show for three months of 2009. Jackson's return changed the dynamic of the Elizabeth and Nikolas affair storyline, which had a negative reception from fans who thought it did not align with the history between Herbst and Jackson. The scenes in early 2010 where Lucky confronts Elizabeth and Nikolas about their affair received praise. That April, We Love Soaps named Jackson No. 26 of the top 50 Greatest Soap Actors, Damon L. Jacobs commenting: [...] "From that first scene as Lucky in the Canadian diner, to his recent scenes of betrayal railing against Elizabeth and Nikolas, Jonathan adds a profound depth and spiritual gravity to the scripted words that is far beyond his years. His piercing <b>bloodshot</b> <b>eyes</b> shoot daggers far more deadly than Sonny's guns, and his smile encapsulates all that was celebrated about Luke and Laura's connection." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide named Jackson the best actor of 2010, referencing the affair confrontation when stating: ...|$|E
