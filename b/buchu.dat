40|$|Magister Artium - MAThe aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the {{socio-economic}} factors that impact on the sustainable harvesting of <b>buchu</b> in the Western Cape of South Africa. Some {{of the factors that}} will be explored include poverty, natural resource tenure, legislation, and local practices with regard to the harvesting of <b>buchu.</b> In order to achieve the objectives of the study, which include documenting different local livelihoods, establishing the roles played by the harvesting of wild <b>buchu</b> within these livelihoods, and analyzing perceptions of different stakeholders regarding sustainable harvesting of <b>buchu,</b> the study employed two approaches. The first was a review of the literature, and the second, empirical research {{in the form of a}} case study (the communal land owners of Elandskloof, Western Cape) was utilized. Agathosma betulina, one type of <b>buchu</b> and cited as the best type of <b>buchu,</b> has gained popularity as there is a demand for plant material both locally and internationally. This demand has created some concerns for wild populations of <b>buchu</b> as much of the industry is still supplied by populations harvested from the wild. Cultivation of <b>buchu</b> has emerged as a possible pressure lifter to the wild populations, as a poverty reduction strategy (as rural people are also cultivating), and as a way to provide for some of the demand experienced in the market. The <b>buchu</b> industry is a very lucrative one and, therefore, many problems are being identified and experienced. Noting this, the study makes two broad arguments. Firstly, even though the <b>buchu</b> trade is dynamic and fraught with many difficulties, it is a trade that can benefit all stakeholders and, consequently, there is a need for new legislation or a review of the current legislation guiding the industry. Better monitoring and evaluating processes, as well as information and communication platforms where stakeholders can interact, prove important. Hence, this should include the participation from stakeholders at all levels. Secondly, in order to establish effective policy guidelines, an understanding of the social dynamics that influences <b>buchu</b> harvesting is important for the resource sustainability as well as the trade.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Agronomy) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. An {{increase}} in the demand of <b>buchu</b> (Agathosma betulina) oil has lead to an {{increase in}} the commercial cultivation of <b>buchu</b> in fields and also in hydroponic systems. A nutrient solution for hydroponically grown <b>buchu</b> is still required to ensure optimal growth and yield. ASNAPP (Agribusiness in Sustainable Natural African Plant Products) South Africa has done some trials to achieve optimal EC and pH in the nutrient solution. Phosphate concentrations in the nutrient solution might play a significant role due to reports by a variety of researchers on the sensitivity of Protea plants to phosphate. <b>Buchu</b> and Proteas are both part of the Fynbos biome and are found in regions with similar soil (sandy soils with a low pH and mineral contents) and climatic conditions. Two separate experiments were conducted to determine the effect of increasing phosphate concentrations (ranging from 0. 00 to 1. 40 me L- 1) in the nutrient solution on <b>buchu</b> growth. The first experiment was done in a plastic covered structure with a pad and fan and the objective of this trial was to determine the effect of increasing phosphate concentrations in the nutrient solution on the general growth, biomass production, oil composition, mortality rate and chemical composition of the <b>buchu</b> plants. The second experiment was done in a glasshouse with mechanical temperature control and the aim of this trial was to determine the response of <b>buchu</b> to increasing concentrations of P at two different root temperatures. A chemical analysis of the plants was done and the general growth, yield and root mass were recorded to determine the response of <b>buchu</b> plants to the phosphate and temperature treatments. In the greenhouse experiment an optimum growth and yield response of <b>buchu</b> plants was found at a phosphate concentration of 0. 7 me L- 1 in the nutrient solution. Phosphate concentrations lower or higher than 0. 7 me L- 1 lead to a decrease in growth and yield. An {{increase in the}} phosphate concentration in the nutrient solution lead to a general increase in N, P, K, Ca, Mg and B content in the <b>buchu</b> plants and a decrease in Fe content. The mortality rate of the <b>buchu</b> plants increased with an increase in the phosphate concentration from 0. 0 to 1. 4 me L- 1 in the nutrient solution. The phosphate concentration in the nutrient solution only made a significant difference on one major component of the <b>buchu</b> oil which was Ψ-Diosphenol, but no general trend with Ψ-Diosphenol content and P concentration could be found and the significant difference in Ψ-Diosphenol observed in this trial may only have been due to genetic variation between the plants. The effect of the different root temperatures in the glasshouse experiment was very clear. The <b>buchu</b> plants grown at the high root temperature (20 °C) produced a higher yield and better overall growth than the plants grown at lower (10 °C) temperatures. The <b>buchu</b> plants grown at 20 °C had a significantly higher N, K, Na and B content than plants grown at 10 °C. <b>Buchu</b> plants grown at 10 °C showed no significant response in terms of growth and yield to the phosphate concentration in the nutrient solution, but plants grown at 20 °C exhibited growth and yield peaks at phosphate concentrations of 0. 35 and 1. 4 me L- 1. The peak observed in the plants growth at high phosphate concentrations is unexplainable and can possibly be ascribed to the limitation of the plants per experimental unit and/or amount of replications. The increase in P concentration in the nutrient solution caused a general increase in N, P and K content in the <b>buchu</b> plants. A significant interaction between the phosphate concentration and root temperature was observed for the P, Mn en Zn contents of the plants which meant that the <b>buchu</b> plants respond differently towards phosphate concentrations at different root temperatures...|$|E
