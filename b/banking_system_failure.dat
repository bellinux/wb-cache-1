50|$|The {{unregulated}} {{growth of}} small rural banking institutions can be partially {{attributed to the}} rising cost of agriculture especially in the Corn Belt and Cotton Belt. Throughout the corn and cotton belts real estate increases drove the demand for more local funding to continue to supply rising agricultural economics. The rural banking structures would supply the needed capital to meet the farm commodity market, however, this came with a price of reliability and low risk lending. Economic growth was promising during the period of 1887-1920 with an on average of 6 percent growth in GDP. In particular the participation in World War I (1917-1918) drove a booming agricultural market that drove optimism at the consumer and lending level, which in turn, resulted in a laxer approach in the lending process. Overbanked conditions existed which pressured struggling banking locations to increase their services (specifically to the agricultural customers) without any additional regulatory oversight or qualifications. This dilemma introduced several high risk and marginal business returns to the banking market. Banking growth would continue through the first two decades well outside of previous trends disregarding the current economic and population standards. Banking profitability and loan standards begin to deteriorate as early as 1900 as a result; adding to the agriculture shock and Great Depression to follow. Crop failures beginning in 1921 began to impact this poorly regulated system, the expansion areas of corn and cotton suffered the largest due to the dust bowl era resulting in real estate value reductions. In addition, the year 1921 was the peak for banking expansion with roughly 31,000 banks in activity, however, with the failures at the agricultural level 505 banks would close between 1921 -1930 marking the largest <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> <b>failure</b> on record.

40|$|In {{order to}} protect the public's {{confidence}} in deposit money, governments usually guarantee bank deposits implicitly or through an explicit deposit insurance system. Thus bank insolvency does not induce immediate bank runs. In many episodes of banking crises, several years passed quietly after bank insolvency had occurred, with the insolvency continuing to develop under the surface, and the rash of bank failures broke out only when the bank insolvency exceeded a certain level. In this paper I present a simple model that describes the dynamics of bank insolvency in a form that eventually results in <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> <b>failure</b> or bank recapitalization by the government. The main results are as follows: (1) The government cannot indefinitely postpone recognizing the fiscal loss associated with bank insolvency. (2) The consumption level is too high (low) before (after) bank recapitalization compared with the optimal level. Thus the price conditions become deflationary (inflationary) before (after) bank recapitalization. (3) Social welfare decreases as bank recapitalization is delayed. ...|$|E

40|$|Using our updated {{model of}} the payment {{exchange}} system within the banking industry, we have introduced sudden local economic shocks and calculated their effect on {{the stability of the}} financial system. Our results suggest that the probability of a total banking failure, i. e., the systemic risk of the system, is insignificant unless the degree of the shock and the degree of integration between banks are very large. We find that the larger the shock, i. e., the greater the amount of loss amongst all banks, and the more isolated banks are within the payment system, the greater the likelihood of a localized or global <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> <b>failure.</b> However, given the current limits percentages of capitol banks can loan each other, only worldwide economic crises of cataclysmic significance would cause a collapse of the entire banking system.

40|$|The Nigerian {{banking system}} is {{presently}} riddled with distress, insolvency, and failure. The system is passing through what might seem the roughest phase in its history. The present bank distress and insolvency have {{culminated in the}} failure of many banks. In an attempt to correct this unhealthy development, the regulatory authorities (CBN and NDIC) have devised and implemented many novel policies to check this drift. Despite their efforts, however, the cankerworm continues to eat deeper into the Nigerian banking system. This study seeks to identify significant factors that might explain Nigeria 2 ̆ 7 s <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> <b>failure</b> as perceived by bank officials, and to recommend ways to minimize bank failure in Nigeria. The banking authorities, to a large extent, focused on a single cause of bank failure, such as unprofessionalism {{on the part of}} bank personnel. The majority of those interviewed accused them of committing fraud. The study showed that during the era of bank deregulation, a wider array of factors might have contributed to bank failure. The factors identified in this study are as follows: 1. The acute shortage of experienced and seasoned banking professionals during the era of banking deregulation led to an increase of forgeries and other abuses. 2. The inconsistent and frequent changes in macroeconomic policies during the period under study have negatively affected other macro-economic indicators. 3. Some factors during the period under investigation led to some banks 2 ̆ 7 inability to meet standards set by the CBN/NDIC in respect to: capital adequacy, asset quality, management profile, earnings strength, and liquidity guidelines. 4.

The conclusions underscore that the banking crises examined did not represent an entirely special case-a number of factors identified in the general literature, including macroeconomic shocks, were highly relevant-but note that several of their features were nonetheless specific to this part of the world. These banking crises were the very prototype of endemic crises associated with heavy government intervention in the <b>banking</b> <b>system.</b> In this regard, the paper analyzes the complex role of the government in banking in sub-Saharan Africa, the many channels through which governments intervened, and the economic and institutional environment in which the banks operated.

By controlling for a more comprehensive set of risk/return factors, the study improves upon conventional market discipline tests. Panel data estimations for 1985 - 99 show that depositors prefer banks with stronger fundamentals, and that banks tend to improve their fundamentals after being “punished” by depositors. Banks with stronger fundamentals benefit from lower interest costs and higher lending rates. Market (or “regulatory”) discipline therefore appears to exist in Colombia, perhaps thanks to certain key design features of the deposit insurance scheme.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} macroeconomic and financial sector policy announcements in the United States, the United Kingdom, the euro area, and Japan during the recent crisis on interbank credit and liquidity risk premia. Announcements of interest rate cuts, liquidity support, liability guarantees, and recapitalization were associated with a reduction of interbank risk premia, albeit to a different degree during the subprime and global phases of the crisis. Decisions not to reduce interest rates and bail out individual banks in an ad hoc manner had adverse repercussions, both domestically and abroad. The results are robust to controlling for the surprise content of announcements and using alternative measures of financial distress.

40|$|The 2007 - 8 global {{financial}} crisis {{brought to the}} fore {{a new era of}} liquidity risk. Governments around the globe were forced to intervene to preclude a complete collapse of their respective financial and <b>banking</b> <b>systems.</b> The <b>failure</b> of financial supervision was in part caused by segments of the financial system being either inadequately regulated or unregulated. Thus far the international response - including in Hong Kong - has focused on regulatory tools. However, does this approach reflect the prudent management of liquidity risks which threaten financial stability? This thesis will analyse the optimum supervisory model to manage the financial stability of Hong Kong’s <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> when exposed to substantial liquidity risks. The key elements necessary - financial stability, liquidity, and financial supervision of the <b>banking</b> and monetary <b>systems</b> – will be analysed to form a theoretical basis to determine the optimum supervisory model. Supervisory and regulatory issues influencing the relationship between financial supervision and the regulatory toolkit shall be examined in detail under three broad themes, the unified sectoral supervisory structure, integrated and cross-sectoral supervision, and systemic supervision. Unified sectoral supervision will concentrate on the issue of central banking and whether this should be unified or separated from banking supervision when managing market liquidity. The analysis reveals that the HKMA’s constrained monetary policy powers impairs the capacity to manage financial stability. Further market liquidity tools can be successfully implemented by a central bank without a banking supervisory ambit. A unified structure was beneficial to mitigate co-ordination frictions between supervisors. There was no perceived advantage between the Integrated and Sectoral supervisory models when planning the implementation of market liquidity facilities. However the HKMA’s cross-sectoral supervisory ambit is subject to structural biases with the supervision of hybrid financial instruments suffering from micro-prudential underlap. This flaw can adversely affect the supervision of universal banks’ liquidity ratios. The HKMA is susceptible to a market conduct bias similar to the United Kingdom’s Integrated model. The HKMA does not capture systemic liquidity risks outside the <b>banking</b> <b>system.</b> Systemic macro-prudential supervisory underlap and frictions arise between the HKMA and the Financial Stability Council. The HKMA’s supervision of banks’ short-term liquidity ratios is impeded by systemic cross-sectoral micro-prudential underlap. Supervision of OTC derivative financial infrastructure is constrained by the SFC’s and HKMA’s systemic macro-prudential supervisory underlap. This underlap encapsulates all financial sectors outside the HKMA’s supervisory ambit, notably the shadow <b>banking</b> <b>system.</b> Renminbi infrastructure is subject to a systemic macro-prudential underlap between the HKMA and the People’s Bank of China. Micro-prudential Renminbi banking supervision is inhibited by a supervisory underlap between the HKMA and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. Despite the HKMA’s supervisory structure reflecting Hong Kong’s <b>banking</b> and monetary <b>systems,</b> the design is structurally flawed when exposed to substantial liquidity risks which threaten financial stability in the <b>banking</b> <b>system.</b> On balance, the optimum supervisory model to manage liquidity risks in Hong Kong’s <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> is the Twin Peaks model. published_or_final_versionLawDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis has highlighted {{the importance of}} early identification of weak banks: when problems are identified late, solutions are much more costly. Until recently, Europe has seen {{only a small number}} of outright bank failures, which made the estimation of early warning models for bank supervision very difficult. This paper presents a unique database of individual bank distress across the European Union from mid- 1990 s to 2008. Using this data set, we analyze the causes of banking distress in Europe. We identify a set of indicators and thresholds that can help to distinguish sound banks from those vulnerable to financial distress.

40|$|This paper {{builds a}} multiperiod, general {{equilibrium}} framework for analyzing the macroeconomic effects of financial reforms {{in developing countries}} {{and the costs of}} maintaining official safety nets under the financial system during such reforms. While a financial liberalization yields efficiency gains, adverse macroeconomic effects can arise if the creditworthiness of the nonfinancial sector is weak. In this situation, financial liberalization may also increase the authorities’ expected deposit insurance funding obligations even with strong prudential supervision. Moreover, given the distortions in a repressed financial system, an increase in the required bank capital-asset ratio may increase the funding obligations associated with deposit insurance, particularly when the debt-servicing capacity of nonfinancial firms is low.
