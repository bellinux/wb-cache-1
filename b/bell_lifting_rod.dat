50|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>rod</b> system ran {{vertically}} up the mineshaft, {{either to}} transfer {{power to the}} individual sets of shaft pumps (when they were known as pump rods) or, {{in the case of}} man engines, to operate the man engine rods. In some cases the <b>lifting</b> <b>rod</b> system performed both duties. It consisted of roughly 19 to 20 centimetre thick squared spruce timbers. The poles were dovetailed at the ends and sides and were fixed to one another with correspondingly mortised wooden joints (Holzlaschen). These joints were tightly bound {{to the ends of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>rods</b> with iron collars. In addition the iron collars were prevented from slipping by bolts inserted through them. At set distances there were also hooks on the sides that were used to hang the piston rods (Kolbenstangen). So that the horizontal movement of the flat rods could be turned into a vertical movement, a rotating cross-shaped lever (Kunstkreuz) was fitted to the <b>lifting</b> <b>rods.</b> Connexion to the cross lever was achieved using a crank (Kunstschloss). To balance the load it was usual to have two <b>lifting</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to give an {{innovative}} concept to handle the bore well rescue operations. Nowadays child often falls down in the borehole which is left uncovered and get trapped. It is difficult and also risky to rescue the trapped children to aid in such rescue we proposed a system of designing robots {{to the rescue of}} a child in a borehole. The robot structure consists of power supply, switch pad, gear motors, Oxygen concentrator, camera and Microcontroller. The condition of trapped child is captured with CCTV camera and monitored on a TV. A safety balloon is introduced in order to provide extra safety. Once the <b>lifting</b> <b>rod</b> reaches a safe position under the child, an air compressor is operated to pump air to the bladder attached {{to the end of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>rod</b> through an air tube that runs downwards inside the <b>lifting</b> <b>rod.</b> The bladder provides a safe seating to the child. When the child is secure, the <b>lifting</b> <b>rod</b> is contracted to its maximum position. The motor is then reversely operated so as to unclamp the system. Simultaneously, it is lifted out of the well using a chain or rope. The programming language is Embedded C which is executed by MP lab Integrated Development Environment. This robot type machine can rescue trapped body from the bore well in a minimum amount of time and safety...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Based on {{the output}} of {{software}} made in Visual Basic, an electromechanical implement lift system with position control was developed to maximize useful power of a low horse power (hp) tractor by replacing hydraulic system requiring higher power. It comprised of two lower links, one top link, two <b>lift</b> <b>rods,</b> one connecting rod and a power screw mechanism. The prototype was tested as per IS: 12224 - 1987 for recommended load of 150 kg on test frame and satisfactory results were found. The response time for lifting a load of maximum lifting capacity on test frame i. e. 116 kg and 110 kg for entire lifting range {{was found to be}} 71 s and 20. 7 s for single start screw and triple start screw, respectively as compared to 44. 7 s and 13. 3 s for lowering the loads. The position control of the system was also tested and found satisfactory with no drop in the height for maximum lifting capacity. The developed system could save 88 % of tractor input power compared to hydraulic system. Highlights • Design of an electromechanical implement lift system for low hp tractor. • Provision of position control system. • A single operator’s switch could operate the system and preset the depth. • Saving of tractor input power by 88 % compare to hydraulic system...|$|R
