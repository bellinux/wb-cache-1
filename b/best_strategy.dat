5|$|The game {{received}} wide critical acclaim, {{being compared}} favorably to Civilization II. Critics praised its science fiction storyline (comparing the plot to works by Stanley Kubrick, Frank Herbert, Arthur C. Clarke, and Isaac Asimov), the in-game writing, the voice acting, the user-created custom units, {{and the depth}} of the technology tree. Alpha Centauri also won several awards for best game of the year and <b>best</b> <b>strategy</b> game of the year.|$|E

As most roguelikes feature the concept of permadeath, this represents {{the end of the}} game, and the player will need to restart the game with a newly made character. Roguelikes are nearly always turn-based, with the game only reacting when the player makes an action with the character. This allows players to evaluate a difficult situation, such as being cornered by several monsters, at their own pace and determine the <b>best</b> <b>strategy.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{prominent}} {{position in}} the Nguyễn Dynasty, {{little is known about}} Phan's personal stance on Vietnamese relations with France, which {{was in the process of}} colonising Vietnam. France had first invaded in 1858, beginning the colonisation of southern Vietnam. Three provinces were ceded under the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, and a further three in 1867 to form the colony of Cochinchina. During the period, there was debate in the Huế court on the <b>best</b> <b>strategy</b> to regain the territory. One group advocated military means, while another believed in the use of diplomacy in addition to financial and religious concessions. By the time of Tự Đức's death in 1883, the whole of Vietnam was colonised, henceforth incorporated with Laos and Cambodia into French Indochina.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their best}} efforts to control Viet Cong {{activities}} across the river in the Thu Thiem area, the South Vietnamese military and police could not stop Viet Cong agents from operating there. So Viet Cong members of the 65th Special Operations Group were able to watch U.S. and South Vietnamese military activities at the port, while they were preparing to attack American targets. Lam Son Nao, a commando of the 65th Special Operations Group, was also an employee at the port facility. As his unit was assigned with the mission to attack the American escort carrier, Nao took advantage of his position as an employee at the port facility, to reconnoitre Card to design the <b>best</b> <b>strategy</b> to sabotage the ship and all the military hardware on board. Nao’s father had previously worked at the port facility as a tradesman, so he memorised all the underground tunnels and sewerage systems which ran {{in and out of}} the facility. He advised Nao that the best way to enter the area where the American ships normally anchored, was via the sewer tunnel opposite Thu Thiem.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, the {{political}} establishment in South Vietnam was still in turmoil. Following the coup that ousted Ngô Đình Diệm, the military situation quickly worsened as the Viet Cong gained significant ground in the countryside because the Military Revolutionary Council which governed South Vietnam, lacked direction {{both in terms of}} policy and planning. Furthermore, General Dương Văn Minh, as the Chairman of the Military Revolutionary Council, and his civilian Prime Minister Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ favoured a political resolution instead of using military force, which brought them into conflict with the United States over the <b>best</b> <b>strategy</b> to end the Communist threat in South Vietnam. As a result, both men became increasingly unpopular among the military generals who held real political power in Saigon. On January 30, 1964, General Nguyễn Khánh successfully ousted Dương Văn Minh from the Military Revolutionary Council without firing a single shot. For much of the year, Khánh spent most of his efforts on consolidating political power, instead of fighting the Viet Cong.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the political unrest in Saigon, the Communist leadership in North Vietnam were far {{more concerned about the}} <b>best</b> <b>strategy</b> to fight the South Vietnamese government and their American supporters. While all leaders in Hanoi shared the same goal of eventual reunification of their homeland, different factions within the Communist Party disagreed on the best method to achieve their desired goal. Members of North Vietnam's Politburo were divided by the issues surrounding the Soviet strategy of peaceful co-existence versus the Chinese strategy of supporting national liberation movements in emerging countries. Despite their differences of opinion, the Communist Party leadership ultimately made preparations for armed struggle in South Vietnam. From Hanoi's perspective, the military regime in Saigon was able to hold out because the Communist main forces were still not ready to fight a conventional war, so North Vietnam must focus on the development of its military force in the shortest period of time. In the meantime, however, the war must be kept at its current level in order to prevent the full involvement of the United States military.|$|E
5|$|The year of 1964 {{marked a}} decisive {{turning point in}} the Vietnam War. Following the ousting of President Ngô Đình Diệm in 1963, South Vietnam's top army generals {{continued}} to vie with each other for control of the country’s military-dominated government instead of combating the emerging forces of the National Liberation Front, also known as the Viet Cong. The fragility of the South Vietnamese government was reflected on the battlefield, where its military experienced great setbacks against the Viet Cong. Taking advantage of Saigon's political instability, Communist leaders in Hanoi began preparing for war. Even though key members of North Vietnam's Politburo disagreed on the <b>best</b> <b>strategy</b> to reunite their country, they ultimately went ahead to prepare for armed struggle against South Vietnam and their American supporters.|$|E

25|$|Scabies is endemic in many {{developing}} countries, where {{it tends to be}} particularly problematic in rural and remote areas.

25|$|The Australian painted lady's {{mating system}} evolved {{due to a}} highly {{dispersed}} female population. Food and oviposition sites are abundant as females feed {{on a wide range}} of host plants; therefore, females do not cluster around hotspots of resources. This tendency makes it impossible for a male to defend the entirety of a female's range. Therefore, the <b>best</b> <b>strategy</b> for males is to defend a territory in which females are likely to travel. Females generally only visit male territories when they are receptive, with the purpose of copulating. However, when an abundant food source attracts a significant number of females, males no longer exhibit territoriality, and are seen searching for mates in areas where females are clustered.|$|E

Even with a large army, but greater naval power, the traditional British answer against a continental enemy was to fight {{as part of a}} coalition and mount small peripheral operations designed to gradually weaken the enemy. The United States, with the larger U.S. Army, favoured a more direct method of fighting the main force of the German Army in Northwestern Europe.

It was hoped that a substantial invasion {{in the summer of}} 1796 would encourage a widespread uprising among the Irish population and force the British to abandon Ireland, providing a major strategic and propaganda coup for the French Republic and a staging point for a subsequent invasion of Britain.

25|$|Like {{all other}} hymenopterans, P. colobopterus is haplodiploid. This means that unfertilized eggs will produce males, while fertilized eggs will produce females. Workers are {{therefore}} {{able to produce}} their own male offspring {{even though they have}} not been inseminated. Since each worker would be more closely related to her son than the male offspring of any other workers, it may be expected that the production of males would be a major source of conflict. However, workers are more closely related to the queens than to each other, meaning that they are therefore more closely related to the male offspring of the queens than the male offspring of other workers. The <b>best</b> <b>strategy</b> for workers is to suppress the reproduction of other workers and allow the queens to produce males.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The current {{paper is}} an attempt to find a {{sustainable}} fuel strategy for passenger cars in Iran. Currently, most of Iran’s passenger cars consume gasoline, a non-renewable fossil fuel. This fuel has well-known environmental impacts, including various kinds of pollutions, as well as the threat of quick running out. These general negative characteristics of gasoline are amplified by the high consumption rate of Iran’s transportation sector, (e. g. about three times more than that of UK). The objective of this paper is firstly selecting possible alternative fuels for Iran’s transportation sector, and then proposing the percent of cars consuming these alternative fuels (along with gasoline). The <b>best</b> <b>strategies</b> are proposed based on environmental and economic considerations, and hence are more sustainable decisions comparing with the other <b>strategies.</b> The <b>best</b> <b>strategies</b> are found using partial order theory and Hasse diagram technique, which is a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tool...|$|R
