40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} acidic, electrolyzed {{oxidizing}} (EO) water and chlorinated {{water on the}} spoilage mi-croflora of processed broiler carcasseswas examined. Car-casses were sprayed for 5 s at 80 psi with tap, chlorinated, or EO water in an inside-outside <b>bird</b> <b>washer.</b> Treated carcasses were then stored at 4 Â°C for 0, 3, 7, or 14 d, and the microbial flora of the carcasses was sampled using the whole-carcass rinse procedure. Populations of psych-rotrophic bacteria and yeasts in the carcass rinsates were enumerated. Results indicated that immediately after spraying the carcasses, significantly fewer psychrotrophic bacteria were recovered from carcasses sprayed with chlorinated or EOwater than from carcasses sprayedwith tap water. Furthermore, significantly fewer yeasts were recovered from carcasses sprayed with EO water than Key words: spoilage microflora, broiler carcass, electrolyzed water, chlorinated water, inside-outside bird washe...|$|E
40|$|Campylobacter is {{the most}} {{commonly}} reported gastrointestinal bacterial pathogen in humans in many developed countries. During slaughter of broiler flocks, {{it is difficult to}} avoid contamination of broiler carcasses. This study aimed to quantify Campylobacter contamination on broiler carcasses at 5 points in the slaughter processing during the slaughter of a Campylobacter-colonized flock by real-time PCR and conventional enumeration. In addition, the decontamination effect of neutral electrolyzed oxidizing (EO) water and 1. 5 % lactic acid (pH 2. 0) were evaluated. During processing, the Campylobacter counts on the carcasses declined {{toward the end of the}} processing line. The log counts on the carcasses as determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), decreased from 9. 37 after scalding to 8. 08 after the last cooling step. Enumeration of the campylobacters on plates revealed the same trend, although the counts per carcass were generally 3 logs lower. After scalding, a mean of 6. 86 log cfu/carcass were counted, which decreased to 4. 83 log cfu/carcass after the last cooling step. Submerging carcasses after scalding in EO water gave a significant reduction of 1. 31 log cfu/carcass by enumeration on plates and a not significant reduction of 0. 53 log cfu/carcass by qPCR. Treatment of the carcasses after the inside-outside <b>bird</b> <b>washer</b> led to reductions from 0. 09 to 0. 91 log cfu/carcass, although not significant. After submerging the carcasses in a 1. 5 % lactic acid solution, significant reductions of 1. 62 and 1. 24 log cfu/carcass by qPCR and enumeration, respectively, were observed. Spraying the carcasses with lactic acid led to nonsignificant reductions of 0. 68 log cfu/carcass determined by qPCR and 0. 26 log cfu/carcass by enumeration. Both EO water and lactic acid seem promising for implementation in poultry processing plants...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} hand-held inside <b>bird</b> <b>washers</b> on the microbiological and hygienic quality of turkey carcasses. These washers, one per eviscerating line, are simple water wands that discharge water into the body cavity of each turkey as it moves on the eviscerating line. Total viable plate counts were made from calcium alginate swabs taken in a 10 cm 2 area adjacent to the left kidney. A sterile template was used to standardize the area to be swabbed. Two hundred turkeys were sampled after washers were used, and 200 were sampled after washers were not used. Bacterial counts from the two groups were not significantly different (P>. 05). Daily head counts of processed turkeys were recorded, and daily turbidity values of prechiller water were determined for 20 consecutive days of processing after hand-held washers were used and for 20 consecutive days of processing after hand-held washers were not used. No statistical difference was found between the groups for days when the washers were used or not used (P>. 05). It was concluded that hand-held inside <b>bird</b> <b>washers</b> had no effect on microbiological or hygienic turkey carcass quality as determined by total bacterial counts made from the body cavity or turbidity value of the prechiller water...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Processors are washing {{carcasses}} {{with one}} or more inside-outside <b>bird</b> <b>washers</b> (IOBW) to comply with the zero tolerance for visible feces regulation mandated by the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service. A study was conducted to determine the effect of an IOBW on total aerobic bacteria, E. coli, Campylobacter, and Salmonella recovered from uncontaminated (control), contaminated, and possibly cross contaminated broiler carcasses at two different IOBW water pressure settings. In each of three trials, 12 commercially processed carcasses, divided into two groups each containing two control carcasses, two carcasses contaminated with 0. 1 g cecal contents (inoculated with Campylobacter and Salmonella), and two carcasses uncontaminated and placed adjacent to contaminated birds during washing (to determine cross contamination) were prepared (n= 36). Whole carcass rinses were conducted on carcasses before contamination and washing, then again after washing. Carcasses were washed with an in-line commercial IOBW set at 140 birds per minute for a 5 sec dwell time and either 276 or 552 kPa (40 or 80 PSI) water pressure. Counts of total bacteria, E. coli, Campylobacter, or Salmonella were not significantly affected (P< 0. 05) by contamination with feces, by cross-contamination, or by IOBW pressure. The overall effect of washing was a slight but significant reduction in total aerobic bacteria (4. 9 to 4. 8) and E. coli (3. 2 to 3. 0) log cfu/ml rinsate. The IOBW decreased the incidence of Campylobacter from 22 / 36 positive carcasses (1...|$|R

The IOBW decreased the incidence of Campylobacter from 22 / 36 positive carcasses (14 positive incoming carcasses plus 8 inoculated carcasses) to 1 / 36 positives, while Salmonella incidence decreased from 12 / 36 contaminated (inoculated) carcasses to 3 / 36 positive carcasses after washing. The IOBW removed carcass contamination to levels equivalent with uncontaminated controls without cross contaminating other carcasses. The incidence of Campylobacter was decreased, as was Salmonella to a lesser extent. Small reductions of bacterial numbers were noted for total bacteria and E. coli...|$|R
