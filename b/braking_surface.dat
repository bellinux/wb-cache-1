25|$|Using a plasma {{spray process}} and mixed with titania, it is coated onto the <b>braking</b> <b>surface</b> of some bicycle rims to provide {{abrasion}} and wear resistance.|$|E
25|$|While {{all types}} of brakes will {{eventually}} wear out the <b>braking</b> <b>surface,</b> a brake disc is easier and cheaper to replace than a wheel rim or drum.|$|E
25|$|With {{hand-operated}} brakes, {{force is}} applied to brake levers mounted on the handlebars and transmitted via Bowden cables or hydraulic lines to the friction pads, which apply pressure to the <b>braking</b> <b>surface,</b> causing friction which slows the bicycle down. A rear hub brake may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the back pedal coaster brakes which were popular in North America until the 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|For 2009, Zipp {{introduced}} a new 88/188 hub series with adjustable pre-load, seals, wider axle and higher flanges, redesigned the 404 and 808 all carbon rims giving them torodial <b>braking</b> <b>surfaces.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{electricity}} {{is removed from}} the brake, the armature is free to turn with the shaft. Springs keep the friction disk and armature away from each other. There is no contact between <b>braking</b> <b>surfaces</b> and minimal drag.|$|R
50|$|Cosmoline is also {{frequently}} applied to automotive disc brake rotors at the factory, to prevent corrosion {{inside the box}} before the rotor is placed into service on a vehicle. It is easily removed by spraying brake cleaner on the <b>braking</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the rotor.|$|R
25|$|The primary modern {{mechanical}} {{actuation mechanism}} uses brake levers coupled to Bowden cables to move brake arms, thus forcing pads against a <b>braking</b> <b>surface.</b> Cable mechanisms are usually less expensive, but may require some maintenance related to exposed {{areas of the}} cable. Other mechanical actuation mechanisms exist: see Coaster brakes for back-pedal actuation mechanisms, and Rod-actuated brakes for a mechanism incorporating metal rods. The first Spoon brakes were actuated by a cable that was pulled by twisting {{the end of a}} handlebar.|$|E
25|$|Rim brakes require regular maintenance. Brake pads {{wear down}} {{and have to be}} replaced. And before they wear out completely, their {{position}} may need to be adjusted as they wear. Because the motion of most brakes is not perfectly horizontal, the pads may lose their centering as they wear, causing the pads to wear unevenly. Over longer time and use, rims become worn. Rims should be checked for wear periodically as they can fail catastrophically if the <b>braking</b> <b>surface</b> becomes too worn. Wear is accelerated by wet and muddy conditions. Rim brakes require that the rims be straight (not out-of-round or warped). If a rim has a pronounced wobble, then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven, and the pads may rub the rims even when the brake is not applied.|$|E
2500|$|Ceramic-coated rims {{should be}} used with special pads because of heat {{build-up}} at the pad-rim interface; standard pads can leave a [...] "glaze" [...] on the ceramic <b>braking</b> <b>surface,</b> reducing its inherent roughness and leading to a severe drop in wet-weather braking performance.|$|E
40|$|A {{brake system}} is {{provided}} that applies <b>braking</b> forces on <b>surfaces</b> {{in both the}} translational and rotational directions using a single acting self-contained actuator that travels with the translational mechanism. The brake engages a mechanical lock and creates a frictional force on the translational structure preventing translation while simultaneously creating a frictional torque that prevents rotation of the vertical support. The system may include serrations on the <b>braking</b> <b>surfaces</b> to provide increased braking forces...|$|R
5000|$|Raleigh Bicycle Company {{developed}} a variation that combined the rod <b>braking</b> <b>surfaces</b> of Westwood rims with flat sides for caliper braking. It {{has been called}} [...] "Raleigh Pattern" [...] and [...] "Westrick". They are noted for their strength, {{and there is also}} a Schwinn Bicycle Company copy of this design.|$|R
50|$|Fusible plugs {{are common}} in {{aircraft}} wheels, typically in larger or high-performance aircraft. The very large thermal loads imposed by abnormal landing and braking conditions (and RTO notably) can cause already high pressure in the tyres {{to rise to the}} point that the tyre might burst, so fusible plugs are used as a relief mechanism. The vented gas may be directed to cool the <b>braking</b> <b>surfaces.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The <b>braking</b> <b>surface</b> is {{farther from}} the ground and {{possible}} contaminants like mud which can coat or freeze on the rim and pads. [...] With rim brakes, the first point that mud builds up on a mountain bike ridden in thick mud is usually the brakes. [...] A mountain bicycle with disc brakes is [...] less susceptible to mud buildup provided the rear frame and front fork yoke have sufficient clearance from the wheels.|$|E
2500|$|Bicycle {{drum brakes}} operate {{like those of}} a car, {{although}} the bicycle variety use cable rather than hydraulic actuation. [...] Two pads are pressed outward against the <b>braking</b> <b>surface</b> {{on the inside of the}} hub shell. [...] Shell inside diameters on a bicycle drum brake are typically [...] [...] Drum brakes have been used on front hubs and hubs with both internal and external freewheels. [...] Both cable- and rod-operated drum brake systems have been widely produced.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "rod-actuated brake", {{or simply}} [...] "rod brake", (roller lever brake in Raleigh terminology) uses {{a series of}} rods and pivots, rather than Bowden cables, to {{transmit}} force applied to a hand lever to pull friction pads upwards against the inner surface, which faces the hub, of the wheel rim. They were often called [...] "stirrup brakes" [...] due to their shape. Rod brakes are used with a rim profile known as the Westwood rim, which has a slightly concave area on the <b>braking</b> <b>surface</b> and lacks the flat outer surface required by brakes that apply the pads {{on opposite sides of}} the rim.|$|E
50|$|Brake fade {{is caused}} by a buildup of heat in the <b>braking</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the {{subsequent}} changes and reactions in the brake system components and can be experienced with both drum brakes and disc brakes. Loss of stopping power, or fade, can be caused by friction fade, mechanical fade, or fluid fade. Brake fade can be significantly reduced by appropriate equipment and materials design and selection, as well as good cooling.|$|R
2500|$|Adapters are {{available}} to allow the use of one type of lever with an otherwise incompatible type of rim brake. Some brake levers have adjustable leverage {{that can be made}} to work with either type of brake. Others vary their mechanical advantage as the lever moves to move the pad quickly at first, then provide more leverage once it contact the <b>brake</b> <b>surface.</b> Hydraulic <b>brake</b> levers move a piston in a fluid reservoir. [...] The mechanical advantage of the lever depends on the brake system design.|$|R
25|$|Rim brakes are inexpensive, light, {{mechanically}} simple, easy to maintain, and powerful. However, {{they perform}} relatively poorly when the rims are wet, and will brake unevenly if the rims are even slightly warped. Because rims can carry {{debris from the}} ground to the brake pads, rim brakes {{are more prone to}} clogging with mud or snow than disc <b>brakes</b> (where <b>braking</b> <b>surfaces</b> are higher from the ground), particularly when riding on unpaved surfaces. The low price and ease of maintenance of rim brakes makes them popular in low- to mid-price commuter bikes, where the disadvantages are alleviated by the unchallenging conditions. The light weight of rim brakes also makes them desirable in road racing bicycles.|$|R
2500|$|Hydraulic brakes {{also use}} brake levers to push fluid through a hose to move pistons in a caliper, thus forcing pads against a <b>braking</b> <b>surface.</b> [...] While {{hydraulic}} rim brakes exist, today the hydraulic actuation mechanism is identified mostly with disc brakes. Two types of brake fluid are used today: mineral oil and DOT fluid. Mineral oil is generally inert, while DOT is corrosive to frame paint {{but has a}} higher boiling point. Using the wrong fluid can cause seals to swell or become corroded. A hydraulic mechanism is closed and therefore less likely have problems related to contamination at exposed areas. Hydraulic brakes rarely fail, but failure tends to be complete. [...] Hydraulic systems require specialized equipment to repair.|$|E
2500|$|When such a hub is pedaled forwards, the {{sprocket}} {{drives a}} screw which forces a clutch to move along the axle, driving the hub shell or gear assembly. [...] When pedaling is reversed, the screw drives the clutch {{in the opposite}} direction, forcing it either between two brake shoes and pressing them against the brake mantle (which is a steel liner within the hub shell), or into a split collar and expanding it against the mantle. [...] The <b>braking</b> <b>surface</b> is often steel, and the braking element brass or phosphor-bronze, as in the Birmingham-made Perry Coaster Hub. [...] Crude coaster brakes also exist, usually on children's bicycles, where a serrated steel brake cone grips {{the inside of the}} hub shell directly, with no separate brake pads or mantle. [...] These offer a less progressive action {{and are more likely to}} lock the rear wheel unintentionally.|$|E
2500|$|A {{floating}} caliper (also called a [...] "sliding caliper") moves {{with respect to}} the disc, along a line parallel to the axis of rotation of the disc; a piston {{on one side of the}} disc pushes the inner brake pad until it makes contact with the <b>braking</b> <b>surface,</b> then pulls the caliper body with the outer brake pad so pressure is applied to both sides of the disc. Floating caliper (single piston) designs are subject to sticking failure, caused by dirt or corrosion entering at least one mounting mechanism and stopping its normal movement. This can lead to the caliper's pads rubbing on the disc when the brake is not engaged or engaging it at an angle. Sticking can result from infrequent vehicle use, failure of a seal or rubber protection boot allowing debris entry, dry-out of the grease in the mounting mechanism and subsequent moisture incursion leading to corrosion, or some combination of these factors. Consequences may include reduced fuel efficiency, extreme heating of the disc or excessive wear on the affected pad. A sticking front caliper may also cause steering vibration.|$|E
25|$|During <b>braking,</b> the {{friction}} <b>surfaces</b> (<b>brake</b> pads and rims) will experience thermal heating. In normal use {{this is not}} a problem, as the brakes are applied with limited force and for a short time, so the heat quickly dissipates to the surrounding air. However, on a heavily laden bike on a long descent, heat energy may be added more quickly than it can dissipate causing heat build-up, which may damage components and cause brake failure.|$|R
50|$|On {{the south}} side of Gherang is the Australian Automotive Research Centre, the largest privately owned and {{independently}} operated automotive testing facility in Australia. Occupying a 1000 hectare site, it includes a 4.2 km highway circuit, vehicle handling tracks, <b>brake</b> test <b>surfaces,</b> and four wheel drive test tracks.|$|R
2500|$|Chrysler discs were [...] "self-energizing," [...] in {{that some}} of the braking energy itself contributed to the braking effort. This was {{accomplished}} by small balls set into oval holes leading to the <b>brake</b> <b>surface.</b> When the disc made initial contact with the friction surface, the balls would be forced up the holes forcing the discs further apart and augmenting the braking energy. This made for lighter braking pressure than with calipers, avoided brake fade, promoted cooler running and provided one-third more friction surface than standard Chrysler [...] drums. But because of the expense, the brakes were only standard on the Chrysler Imperial Crown through 1954 and the Town and Country Newport in 1950. They were optional, however, on other Chryslers, priced around $400, at a time when an entire Crosley Hot Shot retailed for $935. Today's owners consider the Ausco-Lambert very reliable and powerful, but admit its grabbiness and sensitivity.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic Rim Brakes use the hub, or preferably, a bolt {{on metal}} disc as the <b>braking</b> <b>surface</b> for {{hydraulically}} operated brake mechanisms that push polyurethane blocks against the <b>braking</b> <b>surface.</b> Advantages include good braking power, and good modulation. Disadvantages include possible damage to bearings.|$|E
50|$|Cable-pull 'V' Brakes {{also use}} the hub or metal discs as a <b>braking</b> <b>surface.</b> The hand {{operated}} lever pulls a metal cable to push polyurethane blocks against the <b>braking</b> <b>surface.</b> Advantages include low cost, low weight, and easy installation and maintenance. Disadvantages include low braking power, {{and the need to}} be regularly adjusted.|$|E

40|$|The major aerothermodynamic design {{issues that}} {{influenced}} the VOIR (Venus Orbiting Image Radar) airbrake and mission design are discussed. In {{the discussion of}} aerobrake heating, it is {{pointed out that the}} heat transfer to the deployed aerobrake {{is a function of the}} flow regime encountered during the periapsis pass, the perapsis altitude, and the <b>brake</b> <b>surface</b> geometry. The discussion of spacecraft thermal protection encompasses separated flow heating, aerobrake backface radiation, total solar cell heating, and undeployed aerobrake effects. The aerobrake is designed to protect the spacecraft thermally by limiting the integrated entry heating to the critical solar cell arrays (located on three sides of the spacecraft) due to flow impingement heating, separated flow heating, and backface radiation heating. It is explained that these design considerations led to the selection of a flat-faced aerobrake design located on the front of the spacecraft to provide maximum spacecraft thermal protection. The 8. 4 -m equivalent diameter aerobrake eliminates direct flow impingement heating and lowers separated flow heating on the spacecraft...|$|R
5000|$|Brakes on the [...] "CERV-I" [...] {{are similar}} to the HD type {{available}} on the Chevrolet Corvette. Sintered iron linings are used with fin cooled drums, and the brake drum webs are lightened by drilled lightening holes which also permit the flow of cooling air. The brake drums are cast aluminum with cast-in iron <b>braking</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The rear <b>brakes</b> are inboard mounted next to the differential so that braking torque is transmitted directly to the frame without influencing any of the rear wheel articulating members. Braking effort distribution is 57% front and 43% rear {{to take advantage of the}} superior braking characteristics of the weight distribution afforded by the rear engine type vehicle. The brakes may be actuated by either one of two pedals so that the driver may use either foot depending on the particular driving situation. An unusual brake master cylinder utilizes two pistons operating in series so that it either the front or rear brakes fail the remaining brakes can be actuated.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{fiber optic}} two-color {{pyrometer}} {{was developed for}} <b>brake</b> disc <b>surface</b> temperature and emissivity measurements. The two-color pyrometer consists of a fluoride glass optical fiber, two HgCdTe detectors equipped with bandwidth filters and a data conditioning and acquisition device. The two-color pyrometer measures the brake disc temperature in the 200 - 800 °C range with a time resolution of 8 μs. The calibration formula for the signals obtained using a blackbody of known temperature is used to compute the true temperature. The uncertainty estimation for temperature and emissivity {{was obtained from the}} calibration results. Tests were carried out on known temperature target and a good correlation was found between results obtained with our two-color pyrometer and those obtained with a commercial two-color pyrometer. Hold braking and deceleration braking tests performed on a braking test bench enabled us to reach the <b>brake</b> disc <b>surface</b> temperature and emissivity during braking. Experimental results show a significant variation of emissivity during braking. Direct measurement of emissivity was carried out on the brake disc after braking and shows the emissivity dependence with the surface quality...|$|R

40|$|The present work {{presents}} the morphology {{evolution of a}} <b>brake</b> material <b>surface</b> submitted to <b>braking</b> tests through a laboratory-scale tribometer. Optical microscope images of the material’s surface were obtained for every 10 braking operations. These images were post-processed in appropriate computational software. By means of the image segmentation technique, morphological parameters related to the <b>brake</b> material <b>surface</b> were estimated. The wear rate and also the coefficient of friction resulting from the tests were measured. For the NAO material used in this study, the friction behaviour revealed to be strongly associated {{with the amount of}} contact plateaus. Besides, the mean area of the contact plateaus was the main factor responsible for increasing the real contact area of the friction material. The higher wear rate observed in the first braking operations can be mainly attributed to the higher surface roughness measured in this condition. As the braking operations progress, the plateaus becomes flatter and wear rate is reduced. Finally, the image segmentation technique proved adequate for investigating morphological aspects in friction material surface...|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} braking on {{handling}} {{is complicated by}} load transfer, which {{is proportional to the}} (negative) acceleration times the ratio of the center of gravity height to the wheelbase. The difficulty is that the acceleration at the limit of adhesion depends on the road surface, so with the same ratio of front to back braking force, a car will understeer under <b>braking</b> on slick <b>surfaces</b> and oversteer under hard <b>braking</b> on solid <b>surfaces.</b> Most modern cars combat this by varying the distribution of braking in some way. This is important with a high center of gravity, but it is also done on low center of gravity cars, from which a higher level of performance is expected.|$|R
40|$|Brake squeal {{has been}} studied since 1930 s by many {{researchers}} through ex perimental, analytical and numerical methods {{in an attempt to}} understand, predict and prevent squeal occurrence. In recent years, the finite element (FE) method has become the preferred method in studying brake squeal. The popularity of finite element analysis (FEA) is due to the inadequacy of experimental methods in predicting squeal at early stage in the design process. However, the crux now lies in how the FE method can be a predictive tool rather than a diagnosis tool. This work proposes a new methodology of predicting squeal using the finite element method in order to produce a reliable predicted result. The advancement made in this work is consideration of a realistic <b>brake</b> <b>surface</b> topography. Comparison between complex eigenvalue analysis and dynamic transient analysis using a reduced FE model is also made for different contact schemes. Wear effects on instability of the disc brake assembly are also si 16 mulated. This book is suitable for those who are interested in brake noise and vibration issues like brake engineers, vehicle manufacturers, brake researchers, and undergraduate and postgraduate students. ...|$|R
