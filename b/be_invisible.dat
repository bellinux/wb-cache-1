5|$|In {{front of}} the Royal Crescent is a Ha-ha, a trench on which the inner side of which is {{vertical}} and faced with stone, with the outer face sloped and turfed, making the trench, in effect, a sunken fence or retaining wall. The ha-ha is designed not to interrupt the view from Royal Victoria Park, and to <b>be</b> <b>invisible</b> until seen from close by.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to single}} interstitials, divacancies {{do not produce}} photoluminescence. Divacancies, in turn, anneal out at ~900°C {{creating}} multivacancy chains detected by EPR and presumably hexavacancy rings. The latter should <b>be</b> <b>invisible</b> to most spectroscopies, and indeed, {{they have not been}} detected thus far. Annealing of vacancies changes diamond color from green to yellow-brown. Similar mechanism (vacancy aggregation) is also believed to cause brown color of plastically deformed natural diamonds.|$|E
5|$|The Cassini–Huygens {{spacecraft}} reached Saturn on July 1, 2004, {{and began}} the process of mapping Titan's surface by radar. A joint project of the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA, Cassini–Huygens proved a very successful mission. The Cassini probe flew by Titan on October 26, 2004, and took the highest-resolution images ever of Titan's surface, at only , discerning patches {{of light and dark}} that would <b>be</b> <b>invisible</b> to the human eye.|$|E

5|$|New Zealand's native Cordyline {{species are}} relics of {{an influx of}} {{tropical}} plants that arrived from the north 15 million {{years ago in the}} warm Miocene era. Because it has evolved in response to the local climate, geology and other factors, C.australis varies in appearance from place to place. This variation can alter the overall appearance of the tree, canopy shape and branch size, the relative shape and size of the leaves, and their colour and stiffness. There may also <b>be</b> <b>invisible</b> adaptations for resistance to disease or insect attack. Some of these regional provenances are different enough to have been named by North Island Māori: Tītī in the north, tī manu in the central uplands, tarariki in the east and wharanui in the west.|$|E
5|$|Cyan playtested {{the game}} with two people {{sitting in front of}} the game, finding that they would {{converse}} with each other and vocalize their likes and dislikes compared to one person silently playing. Rand and Robyn sat behind the testers taking notes, and could make on-the-fly changes and fixes. Cyan wanted the interface of the game to <b>be</b> <b>invisible,</b> and to craft a game that all kinds of people would enjoy. Early on they had decided that there would be no inventory, enemies, or ways to die; eventually they included a save system as a concession to the fact that it would take most players months to complete the game. Among the problems testers discovered with the story was that Myst initially had no inciting incident. In response, Cyan added a note from Atrus to Catherine that clued players into the existence of a chamber by the dock that played a message from Atrus and explained the game's objectives.|$|E

25|$|Although Kink.com {{has stated}} that its {{activities}} would <b>be</b> <b>invisible</b> to the surrounding neighborhood, La Casa de las Madres, a neighboring women's shelter, announced in late March 2007 {{that they would be}} leaving the location. The shelter had planned on moving from that location in 2009 when their lease expired, but stated that they would be leaving the location because of the media scrutiny of Kink.com's presence.|$|E
25|$|Their {{hypothesis}} {{shows that}} there is a lower verb embedded within a VP shell that combines with an upper verb (can <b>be</b> <b>invisible),</b> thus creating a VP shell (as seen in the tree diagram to the right).

25|$|Mark of the Ninja {{consists}} of stealth-oriented 2D platforming. The character {{is required to}} sneak {{through a series of}} environments while staying out of sight of guards and performing silent assassinations. Levels are divided into areas of light and darkness; the player character is visible to enemies in the former and invisible in the latter, though passing within a certain immediate distance of an enemy's face results in the player being spotted irrespective of lighting. Sounds such as running may also give away the player character's location and are represented visually by a rapidly expanding circle. Unusual for a platformer, Mark of the Ninja employs a line of sight mechanic, meaning that enemies which would <b>be</b> <b>invisible</b> to the character are also invisible to the player, though their sounds are represented on screen {{in the same manner as}} the player character's.|$|E
25|$|When {{the images}} {{presented}} to the eyes differ only in their contours, rivalry {{is referred to as}} binocular contour rivalry. When the images {{presented to the}} eyes differ only in their colours, rivalry is referred to as binocular colour rivalry. When the images presented to the eyes differ only in their lightnesses, a form of rivalry called binocular lustre may be seen. When an image is presented to one eye and a blank field to the other, the image is usually seen continuously. This is referred to as contour dominance. Occasionally however, the blank field, or even the dark field of a closed eye, can become visible, making the image invisible for about as long as it would <b>be</b> <b>invisible</b> were it in rivalry with another image of equal stimulus strength. When an image is presented to one eye and a blank field to the other, introducing a different image onto the blank field usually results in that image being seen immediately. This is referred to as flash suppression.|$|E
25|$|The {{photoreceptor}} ribbon synapse {{is around}} 30nm in thickness. It sticks {{out into the}} cytoplasm around 200-1000nm and anchors along its base to the arciform density which is an electron dense structure that is anchored to the presynaptic membrane. The arciform density is located within the synaptic ridge, a small evagination of the presynaptic membrane. Hair cells lack an arciform density so the anchor of this ribbon is considered to <b>be</b> <b>invisible</b> by electron microscope. The ribbon’s surface has small particles that are around 5nm wide where the synaptic vesicles tether densely via fine protein filaments. There are multiple filaments per vesicle. There are also voltage gated L-type calcium channels on the docking sites of the ribbon synapse which trigger neurotransmitter release. Specifically, ribbon synapses contain specialized organelles called synaptic ribbons, which are large presynaptic structures associated in the active zone. They are thought to fine-tune the synaptic vesicle cycle. Synaptic ribbons are {{in close proximity to}} synaptic vesicles, which, in turn, are close to the presynaptic neurotransmitter release site via the ribbon.|$|E

25|$|Blacklights are {{a subset}} of {{fluorescent}} lamps {{that are used to}} provide near ultraviolet light (at about 360nm wavelength). They are built in the same fashion as conventional fluorescent lamps but the glass tube is coated with a phosphor that converts the short-wave UV within the tube to long-wave UV rather than to visible light. They are used to provoke fluorescence (to provide dramatic effects using blacklight paint and to detect materials such as urine and certain dyes that would <b>be</b> <b>invisible</b> in visible light) as well as to attract insects to bug zappers. So-called blacklite blue lamps are also made from more expensive deep purple glass known as Wood's glass rather than clear glass. The deep purple glass filters out most of the visible colors of light directly emitted by the mercury-vapor discharge, producing proportionally less visible light compared with UV light. This allows UV-induced fluorescence to be seen more easily (thereby allowing blacklight posters to seem much more dramatic). The blacklight lamps used in bug zappers do not require this refinement so it is usually omitted in the interest of cost; they are called simply blacklite (and not blacklite blue).|$|E
25|$|Back at UNIT, Captain Mike Yates and Sergeant Benton were {{watching}} {{the end of the}} broadcast as it went dead. In the morning they arrive at the village just as a heatwave engulfs the village. The Brigadier finds himself unable to enter the village, as there is an invisible dome-shaped barrier, 10 miles in diameter and one mile high, surrounding it that causes anything trying to enter to heat up and burst into flame. The barrier is centred on the church. He contacts Yates and is briefed on the situation while the Doctor and Jo return to the dig where they find a small spaceship in the mound, which has been condensed. From this, the Doctor realises that the Master is trying to conjure up an ancient and all-powerful demon, who is seen on Earth to be the Devil, but actually an alien. The Doctor explains that the Dæmons have influenced Earth throughout its history, becoming part of human myth, and see the planet as a giant experiment. The Master has called the Dæmon up once, and right now, it is so small as to <b>be</b> <b>invisible.</b> The third summoning, however, could signal the end of the experiment, and the world.|$|E
500|$|In {{front of}} the Royal Crescent is a ha-ha, a ditch on which the inner side is {{vertical}} and faced with stone, with the outer face sloped and turfed, making an effective but invisible partition between the lower and upper lawns. [...] The ha-ha is designed {{so as not to}} interrupt the view from Royal Victoria Park, and to <b>be</b> <b>invisible</b> until seen from close by. It is not known whether it was contemporary with the building of the Royal Crescent, however it is known that when it was first created it was deeper than it is at present. The railings between the crescent and the lawn were included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage but have been restored and removed from the register.|$|E

500|$|The trick {{has since}} been often {{repeated}} and explained. The medium must have the semblance of key-board, made of some light material, concealed in his coat sleeve or about his person. This he attaches {{to the bottom of}} the accordion which he holds in his hand. Then when unobserved, while the learned professor is [...] "taking down his notes" [...] for the public press, he reverses the accordion, and attaching the false keyboard on the bottom by means of a small hook attached to it, fastens it to the side of the basket; having now the real keyboard in his hand he is able to produce musical sounds. Afterward the accordion floated about in the basket under the table, without the contact of Mr. Home's hand. This subsequent phenomenon was given to avoid immediate examination of the first by keeping Professor Crookes in suspense, and giving the medium time to reverse the instrument and conceal in his clothing the false key-board which had been on the bottom of the instrument. The accordion was suspended by means of a small hook fastened to dark thread, which would <b>be</b> <b>invisible</b> in the gas-light.|$|E
500|$|The Earth, {{the sensual}} source of life, and the sterile space station {{orbiting}} the planet Solaris, are contrasted with lively images of underwater plants, fire, snow, rain {{and other natural}} phenomena. A similar contrast appears at story's end on Solaris with Kelvin's [...] "Winter" [...] visit to his father's house, featuring a frozen pond surrounded by bare trees. The dead scenery of this island on Solaris contrasts with the earlier, Summer pond scenes of long-bladed green grasses or ferns gently floating in the water current underneath blooming trees. The Solaris ocean was created with acetone, aluminium powder, and dyes. Mikhail Romadin designed the space station as lived-in, beat-up and decrepit rather than shiny, neat and futuristic. The designer and director consulted with scientist and aerospace engineer Lupichev, who lent them a 1960s-era mainframe computer for set decoration. For some of the sequences, Romadin designed a mirror room which enabled the cameraman, Yusov, to hide within a mirrored sphere so as to <b>be</b> <b>invisible</b> in the finished film. Akira Kurosawa, who was visiting the Mosfilm studios just then, expressed admiration for the space station design.|$|E
500|$|... "Dream On" [...] {{was filmed}} in March 2010. In October 2009, Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} that 20th Century Fox, the studio behind Glee, had approached Joss Whedon about directing an episode during the show's first season. Series creator Ryan Murphy {{is a fan}} of Whedon's work, and praised the musical episode of his series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, commenting: [...] "Joss directed one of the great musical episodes in the history of television on Buffy, so this is a great, if unexpected, fit. I'm thrilled he'll be loaning us his fantastic groundbreaking talent." [...] Whedon deemed Glee his favorite television show, but downplayed his influence over the episode. Asked by Ileane Rudolph of TV Guide whether the episode would feature songs from Buffy, or his 2008 musical Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, Whedon replied: [...] "I would have to say a resonant 'no way.' The episode isn't about me. It's the next episode of Glee. Hopefully my hands will <b>be</b> <b>invisible</b> on the show." [...] Whedon felt that his job was to be anonymous: [...] "to find the most compelling way to present a story without calling attention to himself." [...] He acknowledged his proclivity for killing off fans' favorite characters, jesting that he planned to murder Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba).|$|E
