5000|$|During the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s, the station's news {{department}} suffered {{a number of}} blunders. During a December 1977 broadcast, anchor Jack Cole stated [...] "We'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> alleged news" [...] following a report on how to clean a chimney for Santa Claus. On April 1, 1980, the station aired a news report that stated that Great Blue Hill in Milton, Massachusetts was erupting. The story was an April Fools joke, but the prank resulted in panic in Milton. The station's image was also tarnished by the arrests of reporter Charlene Mitchell for shoplifting and sports reporter Bob Gamere for drunk driving, {{as well as the}} revelation that former reporter Stephen Guptill falsely claimed two degrees on his resume.|$|E
5000|$|We {{are posted}} up in Los Angeles getting into some serious musical activity. Drove down {{a week ago}} and started off with a couple days of final pre-production. We took the songs even further, jamming for hours and digging deep into the details and arrangements.

To top it off, {{we have the most}} awesome production team yet. Nick, Lou, Fig, John and Dave are totally on top of their shit. Fuckin pros, man!By Tuesday we should be knee-deep in guitar tracking heaven. Besides all my own gear, there is a shitload of guitars, amps, cabinets, effects and every damn thing to experiment with waiting to be played this week. Can't wait to attack and throw down some axe trax...Needless to say we are enjoying the process of recording this album to the fullest. We can't wait for you all to hear it. I'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> another progress report in the near future. Rob Cavestany ...|$|E

50|$|In 2002, Alpha Team changed slightly. The toyline {{is known}} as: Mission Deep Sea. Ogel <b>is</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> {{sinister}} looking drones that remained {{from the year}} 2001. Ogel also had re-engineered the evil orb so that it causes mutations and uses it to mutate sea creatures to serve him. Ogel's left hand {{was replaced by a}} transparent red hook that can still hold things (the Lego minifigure). It is uncertain of how he got the red hook. Rumor has it that he lost his left hand while battling Alpha Team. Alpha Team's helper, TeeVee (a television with legs and antennae) can now turn into a deep sea rover for small openings and scouting around the sea embankment. In the webtoon, Into the Deep, Ogel's sinister plan for the mutant sea animals was destroyed when Dash reversed the orb factory controls, thus reverting all the sea animals back to normal. However, Ogel escaped again by detaching the cockpit on his Mutant Squid vehicle.|$|R

Le Monde said the series marked a resurgence in the fantasy genre with the dead appearing out of nowhere, trying to regain their lives where they left off. Libération said the series recalled the atmosphere of Twin Peaks by David Lynch. In France, viewing figures averaged 1.4 million over the eight episodes, on Canal+.|$|R

5|$|The story depicts how {{suffering}} {{is essential to}} completing one's destiny. Southey's purpose in Thalaba, however, is to describe {{as many of the}} various myths and superstitions that he can, and this interferes with the resolving of moral problems within the story. Instead, the moral lessons are formulaic and the events focus on awards given to those who are obedient. Southey's emphasis on the actual mythic incidents over the moral events <b>are</b> <b>backed</b> up <b>with</b> <b>more</b> than 80 pages of his own notes that describe the various references to traditional myths or mythic creatures that are incorporated into the story. In terms of structure, the unilateral plot keeps Thalaba does not allow for an easy flow into various mythic incidents. Instances of the plot being supplanted by the myths can be found during the descriptions of the story of Irem, Haruth and Maruth, or others.|$|R

500|$|An initial rumor {{started in}} early May 2009 that Nintendo planned to remake Pokémon Gold and Silver after the Japanese {{television}} show Pokémon Sunday ended by announcing a [...] "world-exclusive first announcement" [...] {{that would be}} made on its next show. Kris Pigna of 1UP.com speculated that this alluded to a possible remake of Gold and Silver for the Nintendo DS, due to gold and silver disco balls hanging in the background. Pigna further reasoned {{that this would be}} consistent with the previously released titles Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen which were enhanced remakes of the original Pokémon Red and Blue. Several days later, Nintendo officially confirmed that Gold and Silver were being remade as HeartGold and SoulSilver and released their official logos. It also announced that the games would contain numerous updates, although declined to reveal any specifics. The games were released for the Nintendo DS on September 12, 2009 in Japan to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the original Gold and Silver release.

40|$|This master thesis investigates {{different}} approaches to data compression on common types of signals {{in the context of}} localization by estimating time difference of arrival (TDOA). The thesis includes evaluation of the compression schemes using recorded data, collected as part of the thesis work. This evaluation shows that compression is possible while preserving localization accuracy. The recorded data <b>is</b> <b>backed</b> up <b>with</b> <b>more</b> extensive simulations using a free space propagation model without attenuation. The signals investigated are flat spectrum signals, signals using phase-shift keying and single side band speech signals. Signals with low bandwidth are given precedence over high bandwidth signals, since they require more data in order to get an accurate localization estimate. The compression methods used are transform based schemes. The transforms utilized are the Karhunen-Loéve transform and the discrete Fourier transform. Different approaches for quantization of the transform components are examined, one of them being zonal sampling. Localization is performed in the Fourier domain by calculating the steered response power from the cross-spectral density matrix. The simulations are performed in Matlab using three recording nodes in a symmetrical geometry. The performance of localization accuracy is compared with the Cramér-Rao bound for flat spectrum signals using the standard deviation of the localization error from the compressed signals...|$|R
40|$|According to the Agricultural Perspective Plan {{growth of}} the dairy sector will {{accelerate}} from 2. 9 percent to 5. 5 percent {{by the end of}} the Plan period. Nepal is a net importer of milk and milk products. In the past decade the private sector increased its presence in a dairy industry which was dominated by the state owned DDC. Farmers are still facing “milk holidays ” and milk and milk product imports are not decreasing. To sustain and further improve the dairy processing industry in Nepal, it must become competitive in terms of cost of production and quality. Trained manpower should be available to the private sector, raw milk pricing should be based on the quality and fixed by a free market system with little intervention from the government. Extension services should <b>be</b> <b>backed</b> up <b>with</b> <b>more</b> research and animal health support to increase the productivity of the dairy animals and product quality. Government policy should encourage the private sector to diversify products in collaboration with or in joint venture with the external partners from developed counties to explore the export market using their brand names and diversified quality products. Livestock accounts for nearly a third (29. 8 %) of the country’s agricultural domestic products (AGDP) (ICIMOD/MENRIS / CBS, 2003). According to the the Agriculture Perspective Plan (APP) growth in the sector will rise from 2. 9 percent to 5. 5 percent {{by the end of the}} Plan period.

As they age, its head, back, rump, tail, and scapular region whiten. All ages have a pink bill with a black cutting edge on the upper mandible, along with pale pink legs. The northern royal albatross can be distinguished from the southern at sea by its upper wings, the plumage of which are all dark compared to the large areas of white on the southern. The two species also differ in behavior.|$|R

Barris joined in with the eccentricity of the format, using unusual props, dressing in colorful and somewhat unusual clothing (such as the occasional hat pulled over his head, if not his eyes), he became yet another performer of the show, and for many, quite a cult hero. Dubbed [...] "Chuckie Baby" [...] by his fans, Barris was a perfect fit with the show's goofy, sometimes wild amateur performers and its panel of three judges (including regulars Jamie Farr, Jaye P.
