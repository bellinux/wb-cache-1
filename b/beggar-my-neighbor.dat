40|$|Many legal {{practitioners}} and academicians who {{are sensitive to}} changes within the area of international business law have sighted signals of a trend toward greater ethnocentricity in the United States. Whether such a trend exists {{is not an issue}} that can be disposed of categorically, for the signals must be interpreted in light of the institution in question and the sector of economic activity involved. Moreover, an accurate resolution of the issue requires a comparison of the current signals with those of previous periods. Indeed, the post-Smoot-Hawley Tariff era of the late 19302 ̆ 7 s and the older mercantilist epoch were periods during which signals indicated strong tendencies toward <b>beggar-my-neighbor</b> policies. On the other hand, the post-World War II era associated with Bretton Woods issued signals that represented a swing toward the recognition of a need for internationally even-handed policies. Since the late 19602 ̆ 7 s, however, there have been an increasing number of signals which indicate that the United States may be about to return to a policy of economic self-sufficiency and independence...|$|E
40|$|It {{is common}} {{political}} practice {{to blame the}} presently poor performance of OECD economies on huge raw material price increases during the 70 s. This view is apparently backed by recent small-country oil-shock analysis showing within theoretical models how trade deficits and output and employment losses inevitably occur in net oil importing countries. The paper argues that, by its very nature, an oil shock afflicts an OECD country not in isolation. This requires theoretical analysis of an oil-importing economy together with its major trading partners. The paper demonstrates that due to a country-specific superior technological adjustment the oil shock may possibly give a competitive edge to one country {{or a group of}} OECD countries. Then a trade diversion among trading OECD economies benefits a few of them {{at the expense of other}} and may be strong enough to weaken or even turn around negative output and employment effects which originated from the real income trasnfer towards oil producers. Additionally, assessment of real and price level effects of an exchange rate change reveals that in general the <b>beggar-my-neighbor</b> property of a devaluation can be destroyed if imported intermediate goods like oil are taken into account. This outcome should also have some bearing on economic modelling of transatlantic relations under flexible exchange rates. Published in connection with a visit at the IIE...|$|E
40|$|Bretton Woods was {{grounded}} in the Keynesian view that financial markets are innately too unstable to be given free rein. This view, which also shaped the financial policies of developing countries during the 1 st post-war quarter-century, was gradually displaced during the 2 nd post- war quarter-century by Neo-liberalism, with financial market liberalization and heavy reliance on freely mobile international capital as its leading components. However, their adoption by the industrialized countries {{has been associated with}} exchange rate misalignments, excessive debt leveraging, asset price bubbles, slower and more unstable output and employment growth, and increased income concentration; and additionally in the developing countries by more frequent financial crises, exacerbated by over-indebtedness that forces many of them to adopt pro-cyclical macroeconomic policies that deepen their output and employment losses. This paper contends that the association reflects causality, rooted fundamentally in the innate propensity of financial dynamics to go off track along the lines of Minsky’s Financial Instability Hypothesis, an elaboration of Keynes’s view. An open economy extension of this hypothesis explains the frequency of banking/currency crises in the 2 nd quarter-century in the developing countries far better than the convoluted “blame the victim” post-mortems that until recently have been the staple of the IMF. Its recent publications show the IMF analysts moving part way toward the Keynesian view of financial instability, but with a major disconnect between the empirical findings and their implications for theory and policy. As yet there is neither overt abandonment of the efficient market theorizing that had underpinned the IMF’s earlier enthusiasm for financial liberalization, nor candid reconsideration of its opposition to capital controls and other dirigiste policies implied by the Keynesian view. Probably this is because IMF policies are not “owned” by its bureaucracy or membership at large, but by the major financial center countries. Still, the worried discussions among these center countries that global financial discord could lead to deeper financial crises, debt deflation, intensified <b>beggar-my-neighbor</b> trade and currency competition, and the formation of antagonistic regional blocs have a 1930 s aura. Optimistically, this could lead again, as at Bretton Woods, to coordinated stabilization policies, among at least the Big Three financial powers, that would also ease the way for developing countries to return to dirigiste development strategies. More likely, a reprise of the 1930 s will be needed to create the political climate for accepting all this. Given the odds, developing countries should carve out their own policy space, with capital controls as prerequisite for widening that space. ...|$|E
