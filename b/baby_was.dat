5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming process {{as some of}} the darkest days of his career, explaining that the <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving the <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> shot, the crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide the baby through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax the baby into co-operation. One scene required the baby to suckle Chan's nipple. The <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto the nipple.|$|E

5|$|Bringing up <b>Baby</b> <b>was</b> a {{commercial}} flop upon its release, although it eventually {{made a small}} profit after its re-release in the early 1940s. Shortly after the film's premiere, Hepburn was infamously labeled box-office poison by the Independent Theatre Owners of America and would not regain her success until The Philadelphia Story two years later. The film's reputation began to grow during the 1950s, when it was shown on television.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) and her husband, {{state senator}} Robert (Jack Coleman), welcome their new baby, also named Phillip. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Gabe all visit Angela at the hospital. According to Angela, the <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> born prematurely, {{but due to}} the size, Oscar deduces that Angela lied about the date of conception. Angela admits that the <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> {{conceived}} a month before her wedding, and makes them promise not to tell anyone. Suspecting that Dwight is the real father, Oscar breaks his promise and tells him when he arrives at the hospital in search of Gabe. Dwight barges in on Angela and her husband and begins thoroughly examining the child. When the senator leaves, Dwight confronts Angela about the child, claiming that it is his. She refutes his claim, but Dwight leaves satisfied, telling the attending nurse to call off the baby's circumcision, which the nonplussed nurse refuses to do. Upon returning to Dunder Mifflin he drops his dispute with Jim, since his self-assumed fatherhood has given him a new appreciation for the duties of parenthood. The episode ends with Dwight putting a decal on his car, {{in honor of his}} covert new family member.|$|E
