25|$|Time Stealers - A villainous {{counterpart}} to the Time Masters, the Time Stealers are {{a group of}} time travelers that employ their technology for personal gain. Their membership includes Mister Mind (controlling Jonar Carter donning the Supernova persona), Per Degaton, Ultra-Humanite, Despero, <b>Black</b> <b>Beetle,</b> Rex Hunter, an alternate evil version of time traveler Rip Hunter, and evil tycoon Maxwell Lord along with his private android Maximillion, modeled after Gold's partner Skeets.|$|E
25|$|Perlman also enacted several {{modernization}} projects {{throughout the}} railroad. Notable {{was the use}} of Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) systems on many of the NYC lines, which reduced the four-track mainline to two tracks. He oversaw construction and/or modernization of many hump or classification yards, notably the $20-million Selkirk Yard which opened outside of Albany in 1966. Perlman also experimented with jet trains, creating a Budd RDC car (the M-497 <b>Black</b> <b>Beetle)</b> powered by two J47 jet engines stripped from a B-36 Peacemaker bomber as a solution to increasing car and airplane competition. The project did not leave the prototype stage.|$|E

500|$|The line [...] "choke a South Park {{writer with}} a fishstick" [...] is a {{reference}} to the South Park episode [...] "Fishsticks" [...] which parodied West. While he enjoyed the episode, it reportedly hurt his feelings. MTV highlighted the full verse, which goes; [...] "but this pimp {{is at the top of}} Mount Olympus / Ready for the world's games / This is my Olympics / We make 'em say 'ho' cause the game is so pimpish / Choke a 'South Park' writer with a fish stick." [...] The line [...] "What's a <b>black</b> <b>beetle</b> anyway, a roach?" [...] is {{a reference to}} The Beatles.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Time Beetle", {{which was}} {{responsible}} for the creation of the alternate universe, was described in the episode's script as [...] "a huge <b>black</b> <b>beetle...</b> shiny carapace, spindly black legs moving and flexing, mandibles clacking together". Its design was influenced by the Giant Spider of Metebelis 3 that clung to Sarah Jane Smith's back in Planet of the Spiders. The beetle's normal Earth-like appearance was deliberate; prosthetic designer Niell Gorton thought that familiarity would ease the narrative and cited the cat nuns from [...] "New Earth" [...] and the Judoon from [...] "Smith and Jones" [...] as examples. The prosthetic was made using fibreglass and fitted on a harness in order not to burden Catherine Tate's performance. The episode's director Graeme Harper explained in the episode's commentary that only psychic characters such as Lucius from [...] "The Fires of Pompeii" [...] were aware of the beetle's existence.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Black</b> <b>Beetle</b> attacks {{during a}} family hike. During the battle, <b>Black</b> <b>Beetle</b> {{claims to be}} Hector's future incarnation, wanting revenge for Nadia's death. He retracts his statement, {{claiming}} to have killed Hector and taken his scarab. When Milagro was injured by <b>Black</b> <b>Beetle,</b> Jaime loses his temper, finally giving in to the scarab's suggestions to use lethal force. Jaime eventually manages to use tachyon beams to paralyze <b>Black</b> <b>Beetle,</b> only for the villain to claim that he was Jaime from the future {{and that he would}} don the black scarab after Milagro (who would suffer brain damage from the injury she had just received in the present) destroyed the scarab. Jaime, deciding to get Milagro medical attention as quickly as possible, was forced to let <b>Black</b> <b>Beetle</b> escape. Before he departed, <b>Black</b> <b>Beetle</b> tells Jaime: [...] "When you see Ted Kord, tell him I said [...] "drop dead"". When Jaime states that Ted was already dead, <b>Black</b> <b>Beetle</b> replies [...] "Yeah. I know". A few days later, Milagro is shown recovering in the hospital and Jaime is left deeply disturbed by his encounter.|$|E

2500|$|Jaime is {{recruited}} by <b>Black</b> <b>Beetle</b> (who originally identifies {{himself as a}} Blue Beetle from the future) and Garrett {{to go into the}} past with Booster Gold to prevent Kord's death. After saving Kord, Jaime and Garrett return, the future is revealed to be a dystopia ruled by Maxwell Lord, who now was never exposed and defeated. <b>Black</b> <b>Beetle</b> is also revealed to be a future enemy of Jaime's, who tries to create this future so he will never have to deal with Jaime and so he [...] "would not lose her". In Booster Gold #10, seeing the damage done by their actions, Ted decides to accept his death and returns to the past, seemingly to the exact moment where he was murdered by Lord, returning the timeline to equilibrium and thus preventing the dystopia. However, in the epilogue for Booster Gold #1.000.000, a figure with a scarab enters a Kord Industries building that contains a Bug and a picture of Kord's enemy Overthrow among other things. His trademark laugh hints that it is actually Ted, who somehow escaped death but managed to fix the timestream.|$|E
2500|$|Knight made a cameo {{appearance}} as {{himself in the}} 2003 film Anger Management. In 2008, Knight appeared in a commercial as part of Volkswagen's Das Auto series where Max, a 1964 <b>black</b> <b>Beetle</b> interviews famous people. When Knight talked about Volkswagen winning the best resale value award in 2008, Max replied, [...] "At least {{one of us is}} winning a title this year." [...] This prompted Knight to throw his chair off the stage and walk out saying, [...] "I may not be retired." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jaime Reyes {{appears in}} , voiced by Eric Lopez. He {{appears as a}} member of the Young Justice team. Jaime {{believes}} the Scarab to be a piece of technology created by Ted Kord prior to the former Blue Beetle's death at the hands of The Light. In [...] "Before the Dawn", a flashback reveals that one night, an explosion in Kord Industries released the Scarab who bonded with Jaime as he was passing by. Unlike other versions, the Scarab speaks to Jaime only in English and finds lethal courses of action preferable to capture and restraint, which is why Jaime is constantly at odds with it. Unlike his comic book counterpart, he does not experience any discomfort when transforming into Blue Beetle. When Impulse liberates Jaime from the Reach's first attempts to control him, he tells Jaime why he had come to the past in the first place: in his time, Jaime's Scarab would have become on mode and he becomes Earth's dictator. Jaime refuses to believe this, but is still dazed from the experiments. Blue Beetle's Scarab and body are eventually put under full Reach control by Green Beetle, a Green Martian agent of the Reach who wears the same type of Reach armor as Jaime. This virtually trapped Jaime in his mind, and allowed the Reach to make Jaime turn on the rest of the Team against his own will. The Team, mainly Zatanna, later frees Blue Beetle and his Scarab from the Reach's control. He then goes on to play an important role in helping to defeat <b>Black</b> <b>Beetle,</b> another armor-wielding Reach agent, and save the world from the Reach's attempt to destroy it.|$|E

6000|$|However, breakfast {{was over}} and Mrs. Dalloway was rising. [...] "I always think religion's like {{collecting}} beetles," [...] she said, summing up the discussion as she went up the stairs with Helen. [...] "One person has a passion for black beetles; another hasn't; it's no good arguing about it. What's your <b>black</b> <b>beetle</b> now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Hans {{slipped the}} little sack into his pocket, {{and set out}} for the {{overturned}} stone cross where the three roads meet. When he had come to the place, he looked here and there, and this way and that, but for a long time he could see nothing at all. At last, after much looking, he beheld a little <b>black</b> <b>beetle</b> running hither and thither on the stone. [...] "I wonder," [...] said Hans, [...] "if this can be my luck." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{heard the}} mice too, {{rattling}} behind the panels, {{as if the}} same occurrence were important to their interests.

What {{would you do}} if spiders came out of the tap when you turned on the hot water?" [...] she demanded, fixing her eye on Helen.|$|R
60|$|She fixed me, as she spoke, with a {{commanding}} eye. She was a woman, I gathered in that instant, born to command. There seemed, at any rate, {{no doubt in}} her mind that she could command me. If I had been a <b>black</b> <b>beetle</b> {{she could not have}} looked at me with a more scornful superiority. Her eyes were very large and of a rich, fiery brown colour, and it was these that gave me my first suspicion of her identity. As to the meaning of her words, however, I had no clue.|$|E
60|$|And as I {{went along}} the {{embankment}} the first effect was all against my uncle. He shrank--for {{a little while}} he continued to shrink--in perspective until {{he was only a}} very small shabby little man in a dirty back street, sending off a few hundred bottles of rubbish to foolish buyers. The great buildings on the right of us, the Inns and the School Board place--as it was then--Somerset House, the big hotels, the great bridges, Westminster's outlines ahead, had an effect of grey largeness that reduced him to the proportions of a busy <b>black</b> <b>beetle</b> in a crack in the floor.|$|E

Lionel Berrington {{delivered}} himself of these assertions without violence, without passion or the sting of a new discovery; there was a familiar gaiety in his trivial little tone {{and he had the}} air of being so sure of what he said that he did not need to exaggerate in order to prove enough.|$|E
