25|$|In 1982, U.S. {{regulators}} {{broke up}} the AT monopoly, requiring AT to divest its regional subsidiaries and turning them each into individual companies. These new companies were known as Regional Bell Operating Companies, or more informally, <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells.</b> AT continued to operate long distance services, {{but as a result}} of this breakup, faced competition from new competitors such as MCI and Sprint.|$|E
25|$|Southwestern Bell {{was one of}} the {{companies}} created by the breakup of AT Corp. The architect of divestiture for Southwestern Bell was Robert G. Pope. The company soon started a series of acquisitions. This includes the 1987 acquisition of Metromedia mobile business and the acquisition of several cable companies in the early 1990s. In the later half of the 1990s, the company acquired several other telecommunications companies, including some <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells,</b> while selling its cable business. During this time, the company changed its name to SBC Communications. By 1998, the company was in the top 15 of the Fortune 500, and by 1999 the company was part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (lasting through 2015).|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in 1991, the <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells</b> {{began to}} {{consolidate}} operations or legally rename their Bell Operating Companies {{according to the}} parent company name, such as [...] "Bell Atlantic – Delaware, Inc."

2500|$|The United States Justice Department {{opened the}} case United States v. AT in 1974. This was {{prompted}} by a suspicion that AT was using monopoly profits from its Western Electric subsidiary to subsidize the cost of its network, a violation of anti-trust law.

50|$|Many {{of these}} {{companies}} have since merged; {{by the end of}} 2000, there were only three of the original <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells</b> left in the United States. After the 1984 breakup, part of AT&T Corp.'s Bell Labs was split off into Bellcore, which would serve as an R&D and standards body for the seven <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells.</b> In 1997, Bellcore was acquired by Science Applications International Corporation where it became a wholly owned subsidiary and was renamed Telcordia.|$|E

50|$|Even though Frontier Communications {{is not a}} <b>Baby</b> <b>Bell,</b> the FCC {{determined}} that Frontier West Virginia is successor to laws imposed during its time as C&P Telephone of West Virginia; therefore, it is still responsible to uphold obligations expected of Bell Operating Companies outlined in the Telecommunications Act of 1996.|$|R

50|$|Although former {{competitors}} Bell Atlantic (a former <b>Baby</b> <b>Bell)</b> and GTE had assigned geographical monopolies varying {{by region}} in Virginia, they merged {{in the late}} 1990s to form Verizon, now the dominant local telephone service provider throughout Virginia, including both of these area codes.

2500|$|Although [...] "Southwestern Bell" [...] {{generally}} {{referred to}} {{the operations of the}} entire <b>Baby</b> <b>Bell,</b> in 1995, SBC decided to change its corporate name to SBC Communications in order to reposition itself as a national telecommunications company.

50|$|Following {{divestiture}} in 1984 and {{the creation}} of the seven <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells,</b> the service within the LATAs remained regulated until 1996, when the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was passed. Following this, the <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells</b> began consolidating amongst themselves. Section 271 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 also established a way that regulators could approve BOCs to enter the interLATA market in regions where they provide local exchange service. In 1998, Ameritech sold some of its Wisconsin Bell lines (covering 19 exchanges) to CenturyTel, which merged them into its company CenturyTel of the Midwest-Kendall.|$|E

50|$|In the US the 1982 anti-trust {{break-up}} of AT&T {{resulted in}} a number of smaller telephone companies called <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells.</b> Following this the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 prohibited telephone companies from providing video services within their operating regions. In 1993 the National Communication and Information Infrastructure (NII) was proposed and passed by the US House and senate, thus opening the way for the seven <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells</b> Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, NYNEX, Pacific Telesis, Southwestern Bell and U S WEST to implement VOD systems. All of these companies and others began holding trials to set up systems for supplying video on demand over telephone and cable lines.|$|E
25|$|AT was not {{the first}} <b>Baby</b> <b>Bell</b> to sell off rural landlines. Ameritech sold some of its Wisconsin lines to CenturyTel in 1998; BellSouth sold some of its lines to MebTel in the 2000s; U S WEST sold many {{historically}} Bell landlines to Lynch Communications and Pacific Telecom in the 1990s; Verizon sold many of its New England lines to FairPoint in 2008 and its West Virginia operations to Frontier Communications in 2010.|$|R
50|$|In November 2005, SBC (once {{a wholly}} owned {{subsidiary}} of the AT&T Corporation—a <b>Baby</b> <b>Bell)</b> acquired AT&T.

In 2009, the new AT&T removed the statue from the Bedminster Township, New Jersey location and later installed in the lobby of its new headquarters at the Whitacre Tower in Dallas, Texas.|$|R

The {{building}} once had a bell motif in many places on its façade, most notably surrounding the arch over the main entrance doors on New Montgomery Street.
