25|$|Raquel Welch helped {{transform}} America’s feminine ideal {{into its}} current state. Her beautiful looks and eroticism {{made her the}} definitive 1960s and 1970s sex icon, rather than the blonde bombshell of the late 1950s as typified by Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, and others. Welch became {{a star in the}} mid-1960s and was exotic, brunette, and smolderingly sexual. Her countless publicity photos helped to popularize her image, dress style, and 1960s and 1970s fashion trends. Welch and other actresses also made <b>big</b> <b>hair</b> popular.|$|E

Commercially made slim-fitting suits, thin neckties in leather or bold patterns, striped T-shirts, Members Only jackets, clubwear, metallic fabric shirts, cat eye glasses, horn rim glasses with brightly colored frames, androgynous neon colored makeup, and pristine leather jackets were widely worn.

25|$|The Blitz Kids {{described}} the {{movement as a}} retaliation to punk due to it becoming too violent and unsavory crowds such as neo-Nazis and skinheads deciding to jump on that aesthetic bandwagon. It was also a way to forget their relative poverty following the economic recession and the Winter of Discontent. Features of New Romantic clothing varied from individual to individual, although these generally highlighted the implied individualism, creativity and self-expression of the movement, besides its continued adherence to the DIY ethic of punk. It was inspired by different cultures and time periods, films, film noir, and theatricality. Men often wore dramatic cosmetics and androgynous clothing, including ruffled poet shirts, red or blue hussar jackets with gold braid, silk sashes, tight pants, shiny rayon waistcoats, and tailcoats based on those worn during the Regency era. Women, too, were very theatrical in terms of makeup and style, and often favoured <b>big</b> <b>hair,</b> fishnet gloves, corsets, crushed velvet, and elements of Middle Eastern and gypsy clothing.|$|E

500|$|Led Zeppelin {{also made}} a {{significant}} cultural impact. Jim Miller, editor of Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll, argues that [...] "on one level, Led Zeppelin represents the final flowering of the sixties' psychedelic ethic, which casts rock as passive sensory involvement". Led Zeppelin have also been described as [...] "the quintessential purveyors" [...] of masculine and aggressive [...] "cock rock", although this assertion has been challenged. The band's fashion-sense has been seminal; Simeon Lipman, head of pop culture at Christie's auction house, has commented that [...] "Led Zeppelin have had a big influence on fashion because the whole aura surrounding them is so cool, and people {{want a piece of}} that". Led Zeppelin laid the foundation for the <b>big</b> <b>hair</b> of 1980s glam metal bands such as Mötley Crüe and Skid Row. Other musicians have also adapted elements from Led Zeppelin's attitude to clothes, jewellery and hair, such as the hipster flares and tight band T-shirts of Kings of Leon, shaggy hair, clingy T-shirts and bluesman hair of Jack White of the White Stripes, and Kasabian guitarist Sergio Pizzorno's silk scarves, trilbies and side-laced tight jeans.|$|E

The video commences with Cyrus asleep, blindfolded on a mattress in a bedroom. She awakens and writhes on the mattress. Following, Cyrus proceeds to a bathroom, her attire is composed of a white tank top, white boy shorts, a fishnet hair wrap, rollers, and heavy metal jewelry. While in the bathroom scenes, Cyrus sings as {{she sits on the}} edge of a bathtub and prepares herself for an upcoming party. With the arrival of the song's refrains, Cyrus appears writhing in the backseat of a limousine, costumed in a low-cut gold halter top, black hots pants, a black jacket with shoulder pads, and <b>big</b> <b>hair.</b> Once arrived at the mansion party, she is first seen dancing atop a big, wooden table.

It's kitschy eye-candy, perfectly stylized". Bronwyn Barnes of Entertainment Weekly commented that Beyoncé was [...] "the center of attention in the video" [...] partly due to a neon tiger-print mink coat from Versace that she wore. Melissa Locker of Time magazine wrote that the singer managed to channel her inner rollergirl. Vanity Fairs Michelle Collins compared the video with the film Boogie Nights (1997) {{and went on to}} describe the scene where the singer dances on a car as a [...] "Cinemax After Dark". In 2014, Michael Cragg writing for The Guardian ranked the video in the ten best of Beyoncé's career.

500|$|The video {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics who praised Cole's sense of fashion but cited that the video was unoriginal.

[...] The Daily Mail agreed saying [...] " [...] which {{will no doubt be}} interpreted by fans as an insight into Cheryl's marriage to footballer Ashley Cole. Cheryl has ditched her street dance gear for a gown fit for a diva along with suitably styled <b>big</b> <b>hair</b> ...

[...] Lisa McGarry of 'Unreality TV' [...] said the platinum wig was [...] "strange" [...] She also said [...] "if it doesn’t look great, at least it looks shocking." [...] Meanwhile, David Balls of 'Digital Spy' said [...] " [...] this glitzy split-screen affair, Cheryl looks effortlessly classy and glam as she transforms into an Egyptian goddess and - with more success than a certain Mrs. B (Mel B) back in 2001 [...] - shows how to wear a blonde wig without looking like you're on a dirty weekend in the Toon. Perfectly complimenting the song itself, this super-glossy clip also suggests that Cole has a firm eye on global stardom over the next year." [...] Fame magazine called the video [...] "a little edgier than anything Girls Aloud have done".|$|E

2500|$|The immortal Dark Queen is the {{ultimate}} enemy to the Battletoads, as she attempts to eliminate the 'Toads and Professor T.

Throughout the games there have been several inconsistencies regarding her actual size. Even though her height is stated to be six-feet tall on her profile screen in the arcade game (which would mean she is actually smaller than the Battletoads), she normally appears to be of a tremendous size in the games, usually roughly four times the height of the 'Toads. Throughout the series she usually appears to taunt the 'Toads during the cutscenes; despite her royal stature, she prefers to be no more cultured than the Battletoads themselves, due to the crude nature of her speech which consists primarily of surfer slang and offensive puns (such as calling them [...] "cattle-loads" [...] and [...] "wartfeatures"). She leads a renegade army consisting primarily of anthropomorphic pigs and rats is usually fought as the end boss of the game. Her main sidekicks are initially Big Blag, General Vermin and Robo-Manus, later joined by General Slaughter, Karnath and Admiral Oink.|$|E

2500|$|Producers later made {{a series}} of changes to Grace's characterisation. Her style changed and they {{introduced}} a new hairstyle, which has been described as an [...] "enormous bouffant hair-do". Wall was happy with the changes because it helped develop Grace. She told an Inside Soap reporter that [...] "as soon as I got this <b>big</b> <b>hair,</b> I felt the character get bigger. She strutted about more, and it brought a bit of comedy to her." [...] The actress has admitted that it took time for her make-up team to perfect Grace's look. She was unhappy with Grace's shot in the Hollyoaks opening title sequence because the hair was not big enough. But over time she began to leave the make-up department with almost square hair as it grew. Wall is supplied with an additional hair piece which is applied to her head each morning. It takes the make-up department two hours daily to wash, dress and curl it and an additional forty minutes to style it onto Wall's head. Grace's hair is very big and is often seen with differing styles, but always with plenty of volume in the roots to achieve her signature look. The hair style became known as [...] "Beryl Bouffant" [...] on the Hollyoaks set. The hair got so big that directors would sometimes complain that it was blocking views of other characters during filming.|$|E
