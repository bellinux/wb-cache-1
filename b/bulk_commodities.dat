5|$|Although railroads {{have lost}} much of the general-freight-carrying {{business}} to semi-trailer trucks, they remain the best means of transporting large volumes of such <b>bulk</b> <b>commodities</b> as coal, grain, chemicals, and ore over long distances. The development of containerization has made the railroads more effective in handling finished merchandise at relatively high speeds. In addition, the introduction of piggyback flatcars, in which truck trailers are transported long distances on specially-designed cars, has allowed railroads to regain some of the business lost to trucking.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{maritime}} trade routes – {{sometimes in the}} form of artificial canals like the Suez Canal – had visible impact on the economic and political standing of nations. The opening of the Suez Canal altered British interactions with the colonies of the British Empire as the dynamics of transportation, trade and communication had now changed drastically. Other waterways, like the Panama Canal {{played an important role in}} the histories of many nations. Inland water transportation remained significantly important even as the advent of railroads and automobiles resulted in a steady decline of canals. Inland water transport is still used for the transportation of <b>bulk</b> <b>commodities</b> e.g. grains, coal, and ore.|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of a two-country, two-good partial equilibrium model where one of the <b>commodities</b> (the <b>bulk</b> <b>commodity)</b> is an intermediate input in the production of the second good (the processed good), we assume that the government wishes to transfer income to both <b>bulk</b> <b>commodity</b> and processed good producers. Our analysis is concerned with efficient redistribution. The instruments are subsidies or taxes, and there is an opportunity cost of public funds. We use the targeting principle to characterize the set of optimal subsidies or taxes applied on both the <b>bulk</b> <b>commodity</b> and the final good in this vertically related market structure. The theoretical analysis is illustrated using the example of cereals (the <b>bulk</b> <b>commodity)</b> and pork and poultry (the processed good) in the European Union.

25|$|Narrow-gauge {{railways}} cannot interchange {{rolling stock}} such as {{freight and passenger}} cars freely with the standard gauge or broad gauge railways with which they link, and the transfers of passengers and freight require time-consuming manual labour or substantial capital expenditure. Some <b>bulk</b> <b>commodities,</b> such as coal, ore, and gravel, can be mechanically transshipped, but this still incurs time penalties and the equipment required for the transfer is often complex to maintain.|$|E

25|$|Birmingham has a {{distinctive}} culture {{of art and}} design that emerged in the 1750s, driven by the historic importance of the applied arts to the city's manufacturing economy. While other early industrial towns such as Manchester and Bradford were based on the manufacture of <b>bulk</b> <b>commodities</b> such as cotton and wool, Birmingham's economy from the 18th century onwards was built on the production of finished manufactured goods for European luxury markets. The sale of these products was dependent on high-quality design, and this resulted in the early growth of an extensive infrastructure for the education of artists and designers and for exhibiting their works, and placed Birmingham at the heart of debate {{about the role of the}} visual arts in the emerging industrial society.|$|E
25|$|The {{factors that}} drove Birmingham's rapid {{industrialisation}} were also {{different from those}} behind the later development of textile manufacturing towns such as Manchester, whose spectacular growth from the 1780s onwards {{was based on the}} economies of scale inherent in mechanised manufacture: the ability of a low-wage, unskilled labour force to produce <b>bulk</b> <b>commodities</b> such as cotton in huge quantities. Although the developments that enabled this transformation – roller spinning, the factory system and the industrial steam engine – often had Birmingham origins, they had little role in Birmingham's own expansion. Birmingham's relatively inaccessible location meant that its industries were dominated by the production {{of a wide variety of}} small, high value metal items – from buttons and buckles to guns and jewellery. Its economy was characterised by high wages and a diverse range of specialised skills that were not susceptible to wholesale automation. The small-scale workshop, rather than the large factory or mill, remained the typical Birmingham manufacturing unit throughout the 18th century, and the use of steam power was not economically significant in Birmingham until the 1830s.|$|E
