5|$|Carroon, gravely ill, is {{cared for}} by the Rocket Group's doctor, Briscoe (John Glen), who has <b>been</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> secret affair with Carroon's wife, Judith (Isabel Dean). It is not just Quatermass who is {{interested}} in what happened to Carroon and his crewmates; journalists such as James Fullalove (Paul Whitsun-Jones) and Scotland Yard's Inspector Lomax (Ian Colin) are also keen to hear his story. Carroon is abducted {{by a group of}} foreign agents whose government wants the information they believe he has obtained about travelling in space. It is clear that there is something critically wrong: he appears to have absorbed the consciousness of the other two crew members, and is slowly mutating into a plant-like alien organism.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) becomes {{frustrated}} when Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) {{refers to}} Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) as his boss. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Gabe invite the office over to Gabe's {{house for a}} Glee viewing party. When the show starts, Michael and Gabe get into an argument over how high the volume should be. After taking turns raising and lowering the volume, Michael retreats to Gabe's bedroom, hoping that his employees will follow him there. Meanwhile, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) has <b>been</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> hard time with getting her daughter CeCe {{to go to sleep}} at night, so Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) picks her up to try to calm her down. Pam is stunned that CeCe becomes completely quiet in Dwight's hands.|$|E
5|$|Oliver {{discovers that}} Penny has <b>been</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> {{relationship}} with a patient, Scott (Joshua Bowman), endangering her career. She plans to move to Spain with him and abandon her training, but Oliver convinces Scott to leave without her. Keen to earn praise from his consultants, Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) and Elliot Hope (Paul Bradley), Oliver claims Penny's research as his own, and is awarded her place in an operation. He is promoted to F2 level, and betrays Penny further by revealing her affair with Scott, which results in her failing her cardiothoracic rotation and being moved to the AAU. A rivalry develops between them, but {{they are forced to}} call a truce when a series of pranks endanger a patient.|$|E

5|$|Josie Packard (Joan Chen) and Pete Martell (Jack Nance) discuss Packard's {{trouble with}} her {{sister-in-law}} Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie). Truman and Cooper arrive {{to speak with}} Packard, who had employed Palmer as an English tutor. Packard admits to sensing that Palmer was troubled but cannot help further; Cooper picks up {{on the fact that}} Truman has <b>been</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> relationship with Packard. Catherine calls Packard to tell her that the latter's sawmill lost $87,000 the day before; Catherine is having an affair with Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer), with whom she is conspiring a hostile takeover of the mill. That same day, Hayward visits Palmer's mother Sarah (Grace Zabriskie), attempting to console her. However, Sarah has a vision of a sinister man (Frank Silva) crouching {{in the corner of the}} room, and panics. Meanwhile, Laurence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), Laura's psychiatrist, listens to an audio tape she had made for him, and sobs as he toys with half of a golden heart necklace, the other half of which was found at the scene of the crime.|$|E
25|$|At first I {{had very}} little idea how the story would go. But then {{suddenly}} Aslan came bounding into it.

But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.|$|E
25|$|In October, Snow Patrol {{embarked}} on a second European Tour. The tour saw them visit countries like Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria, Germany and France. Artists like The Cinematics, Declan O'Rourke, Asyl and Joseph D'Anvers supported the band throughout the tour on different dates. Midway through the tour, Paul Wilson injured his left arm and shoulder. The bassist had <b>been</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> little muscle strain, but he had ignored the pain and carried on playing. It built up and became {{too much for him}} to play on-stage. As a result, four French and two German dates were cancelled.|$|E

25|$|When Douglas's eldest brother Francis Viscount Drumlanrig {{died in a}} {{suspicious}} hunting accident in October 1894, rumours circulated that he had <b>been</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> homosexual relationship with the Prime Minister, Lord Rosebery, and {{that the cause of}} death was suicide. The Marquess of Queensberry thus embarked on a campaign to save his other son, and began a public persecution of Wilde. Wilde had been openly flamboyant, and his actions made the public suspicious even before the trial. He and a minder confronted the playwright in his own home; later, Queensberry planned to throw rotten vegetables at Wilde during the premiere of The Importance of Being Earnest, but, forewarned of this, the playwright was able to deny him access to the theatre.|$|E
25|$|The {{inclusion}} of Tate in the England side {{appears to have}} been a result of friction between MacLaren and the selectors (and in particular their Chairman, Lord Hawke) that had developed during the course of the series. According to Fry, the selectors included Tate in the twelve (he was a late addition to the eleven originally selected) because they thought that MacLaren could not possibly pick him and would therefore have to play their preferred eleven. However, MacLaren was supposedly annoyed that Haigh was not included, and therefore on the morning of the match chose Tate for the final eleven in preference to Hirst. However, Tate had <b>been</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> great season, eventually finishing second in the first-class wicket tallies behind Rhodes, and an argument could be made for his inclusion.|$|E
500|$|Jack Gibbons {{writes of}} Alkan's personality: [...] "Alkan was an intelligent, lively, humorous and warm person (all {{characteristics}} which feature strongly in his music) whose only crime {{seems to have}} <b>been</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> vivid imagination, and whose occasional eccentricities (mild {{when compared with the}} behaviour of other 'highly-strung' artistes!) stemmed mainly from his hypersensitive nature." [...] Macdonald, however, suggests that [...] "Alkan was a man of profoundly conservative ideas, whose lifestyle, manner of dress, and belief in the traditions of historic music, set him apart from other musicians and the world at large." ...|$|E

[...] Arcel described Walter as having [...] "a very interesting way of seeing the world. He sees it {{with a sort of}} delight, even though he is obviously {{on the wrong side of}} the light-and-dark spectrum. He’s someone I’ve <b>been</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> lot of fun with." [...] McConaughey described Walter with [...] "I enjoyed approaching my character as if I were the Devil having a good time, getting turned on by exposing human hypocrisies wherever he finds them." ...|$|E
500|$|As the 1950 Detroit Tigers season started, Houtteman {{was on a}} high note, {{pitching}} all {{of spring}} training without allowing a walk. He won his tenth {{game of the season}} on June 28, 1950, and became the first pitcher to hit the 10-win mark alongside Bob Lemon. After the game, he told an Associated Press reporter that he was just about convinced that Lady Luck had decided to give him a break after kicking him around for the past two or three years. Houtteman said, [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> pretty good year and it sure feels good after {{some of the things that}} have happened to me". A week into July, Houtteman notched his eleventh victory, and only lost five games, in a 6–1 win against the St. Louis Browns. Just a few days later, Houtteman was named to the All-Star roster alongside fellow Tigers including Ted Gray, George Kell and Hoot Evers. In the 1950 All-Star game, Houtteman pitched three innings and batted once. He allowed one earned run, three hits, and one walk, his one earned run coming in the ninth inning on a Ralph Kiner home run that made the game go to extra innings.|$|E
500|$|... "Million Dollar Maybe" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a 'B' grade, {{the highest of}} the night. VanDerWerff was polarized with the plot, opining that it was convoluted and stated, [...] "This was a completely stupid plot, but to the show's credit, it commented on this when Homer told Marge he won the lottery and she said she'd much rather have the money than the wedding reception performance he missed." [...] Similarly, VanDerWerff was split with the subplot of [...] "Million Dollar Maybe". In regards to the subplot, he wrote, [...] "The Lisa gets the old people a Wii stand-in plot {{was one of those}} ones where the Simpsons writers have obviously noticed something in pop culture but have yet to wholly grasp what it is or why it's important." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode an 8.1 out of 10, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. Canning felt that the episode was impressive, expressing that it was [...] "a fun and funny episode focused on Homer and his always dysfunctional relationship with his family [...] just what we've come to love and expect after 20 years." [...] Jason Hughes of [...] TV Squad gave the episode a more mixed review, praising the episode's humor, but calling it [...] "random". Hughes wrote, [...] "A lot about this episode bothered me, and I think The Simpsons has <b>been</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> pretty strong season for the most part." [...] He resumed, [...] "This one just didn't hold together as strongly as most of the prior ones." [...] He went on to criticize the character development of Ricardo, opining that it was a [...] "slap to the face to the winner." [...] He then commented: [...] "Peggy Black created Ricardo Bomba as a new ladies man type of figure, so the writers had him drive into a cliff wall and subsequent fiery explosion right away upon his first appearance. He didn't even get to finish what was, I guess, going to be his catchphrase." ...|$|E

500|$|The fifth track, [...] "The Other Side", has churning, chunky guitars, a double-bass {{drum and}} Lee's [...] "ethereal, widescreen" [...] vocals with {{elements}} of R. Lyrically, the song's theme is death. [...] "Erase This", formerly titled [...] "Vanilla", was noted by Mary Ouellette of Loudwire as an [...] "uptempo rocker" [...] similar to [...] "What You Want" [...] which would sound better played live {{rather than through}} earphones. [...] "Lost in Paradise" [...] is a symphonic rock ballad which begins with piano, strings and Lee's unlayered vocals before adding the band for the song's climax; its lyrics reflect Lee's past struggles, apologizing to her fans for the band's five-year absence. The song's musical structure was compared to [...] "Jóga", by the Icelandic recording artist Björk. [...] "Sick" [...] has a loose, lazy melody and a chanted chorus; {{one of the first}} songs written for the album, it [...] "set a heavy direction {{for the rest of the}} record." [...] "End of the Dream" [...] begins [...] "full bore with chunky guitar, then falls into a brooding grove with piano underpinning Lee's unmistakable vocals." [...] In the chorus, Lee sings [...] "Follow your heart 'til it bleeds," [...] evincing the track's [...] "seize the day" [...] message. Lee said about the song, [...] "It's about understanding that this life isn't forever, and how you have to live it, embrace even the pain, before it's all over. As much as it hurts, it just means you're alive. So don't be so afraid to get hurt that you miss out on living." [...] "Oceans" [...] begins with a big, low synth and a vocal before the band joins in. According to Lee, [...] "It's big and lush. We've <b>been</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> lot of fun playing that one especially." [...] "Never Go Back" [...] (originally called [...] "Orange") examines [...] "loss from the perspective of someone losing someone in a tragedy". Lee said that the song, with the lyrics [...] "It's all gone, the only world I've ever known", was inspired by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. [...] "Swimming Home" [...] is an electro-pop song with grinding guitars and a [...] "weeping" [...] piano.|$|E

She might have <b>been</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> wonderful time with him, I'm sure, but I thought her remark that she needed marriage like a rash meant that she was not serious about it", Lady Annabel told the jury.
