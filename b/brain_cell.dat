5|$|HTT is {{expressed}} in all mammalian cells. The highest concentrations {{are found in the}} brain and testes, with moderate amounts in the liver, heart, and lungs. The function of HTT in humans is unclear. It interacts with proteins which are involved in transcription, cell signaling, and intracellular transporting. In animals genetically modified to exhibit HD, several functions of HTT have been found. In these animals, HTT is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. Caspase, an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an anti-apoptotic agent preventing programmed cell death and controls the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during neurogenesis. HTT also facilitates vesicular transport and synaptic transmission and controls neuronal gene transcription. If the expression of HTT is increased and more HTT produced, <b>brain</b> <b>cell</b> survival is improved and the effects of mHTT are reduced, whereas when the expression of HTT is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more typical of the presence of mHTT. In humans the disruption of the normal gene does not cause the disease. It is thought that the disease is not caused by inadequate production of HTT, but by a gain of toxic function of mHTT.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines, {{including}} clonazepam, bind to mouse glial {{cell membranes}} with high affinity. Clonazepam decreases release of acetylcholine in the feline brain and decreases prolactin release in rats. Benzodiazepines inhibit cold-induced {{thyroid stimulating hormone}} (also known as TSH or thyrotropin) release. Benzodiazepines acted via micromolar benzodiazepine binding sites as Ca2+ channel blockers and significantly inhibit depolarization-sensitive calcium uptake in experimentation on rat <b>brain</b> <b>cell</b> components. This has been conjectured as a mechanism for high-dose effects on seizures in the study.|$|E

Together with Richard Coss at the University of California, Davis, Burgess {{was the first}} to show that sensory stimuli, including social stressors, can cause long-lasting changes in <b>brain</b> <b>cell</b> anatomical structure in just a few minutes. Together with Jaime Villablanca at UCLA, Burgess discovered that early brain injury resembling childhood congenital disorders and adult traumatic brain injury can heal naturally and that rehabilitative exercise improves brain healing. He helped clarify the rôle of the caudate nucleus in aggression and found that, without input from this nucleus, usually aggressive cats are friendly and affiliative. Burgess also contributed to our understanding of how the nervous system responds to morphine, especially during early development.|$|E

25|$|The {{increasing}} {{amount of}} quantifiable research that mindfulness {{has on the}} brain and body {{is one of the}} major reasons why corporate mindfulness programs has become more prominent in the modern day business world. Studies conducted by Yale University found that mindfulness meditation is associated with lower levels of activity in the default mode network (DMN), which is part of the brain network that is responsible for self-related thinking and mind wandering. Volume changes in key areas of the brain are also found as a result of meditation. In 2011, a team at Harvard found that mindfulness can actually change the structure of the brain after conducting an eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR) on participants. The research found an increase in cortical thickness in the hippocampus, which controls learning, memory and emotion regulation. The research also found decreases in <b>brain</b> <b>cell</b> volume in the Amygdala, which is responsible for fear, anxiety and stress. These changes were also aligned with the participant's self-reports of their stress levels.|$|E

2500|$|One {{mechanism}} of mercury toxicity involves its irreversible inhibition of selenoenzymes, such as thioredoxin reductase (IC50 = 9 nM). [...] Although it has many functions, thioredoxin reductase restores vitamins C and E, {{as well as}} a number of other important antioxidant molecules, back into their reduced forms, enabling them to counteract oxidative damage. [...] Since the rate of oxygen consumption is particularly high in brain tissues, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is accentuated in these vital cells, making them particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage and especially dependent upon the antioxidant protection provided by selenoenzymes. [...] High mercury exposures deplete the amount of cellular selenium available for the biosynthesis of thioredoxin reductase and other selenoenzymes that prevent and reverse oxidative damage, which, if the depletion is severe and long lasting, results in <b>brain</b> <b>cell</b> dysfunctions that can ultimately cause death.|$|E

50|$|Alzheimer's disease {{damages and}} kills <b>brain</b> <b>cells.</b> Compared {{to a healthy}} brain, the brain of an Alzheimer’s {{sufferer}} has fewer cells and there are fewer connections among surviving cells. This inevitably leads to brain shrinkage. This disease characterises two types of abnormalities: plaques and tangles. Plaques are clumps of a protein called beta-amyloid. They may damage and destroy <b>brain</b> <b>cells</b> by interfering with cell-to-cell communication, among others. The collection of beta-amyloid {{on the outside of}} <b>brain</b> <b>cells</b> is thought to be implicated in the cause of this disease. Tangles are threads of another protein, tau. Tau twist into abnormal tangles inside <b>brain</b> <b>cells,</b> resulting in failure of the transport system, which is also implicated in the death of <b>brain</b> <b>cells.</b> The <b>brain</b> relies on this internal support and transport system in order to carry nutrients and essential materials, requiring the normal structure and functioning of tau. It has been suggested that attentional decline in mild AD is perhaps contingent on degeneration in the cerebral network for attention. This network includes the occipital lobe, adjacent temporal and parietal areas, frontal lobe, and subcortical regions. As the disease progresses, the prefrontal cortex begins to degenerate, and lower SAS systems lose their autonomic features.|$|R
