50|$|PAHs - The EPA has {{classified}} seven PAH compounds as probable human carcinogens: benzaanthracene, benzoapyrene, benzobfluoranthene, <b>benzokfluoranthene,</b> chrysene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Benzokfluoranthene</b> [...] is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the chemical formula C20H12. Classified as a {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH), it is a colourless solid that is poorly soluble in most solvents. Impure samples can appear off white. Closely related isomeric compounds include benzo(a)fluoranthene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(e)fluoranthene, and benzo(j)fluoranthene.|$|E
50|$|BjF {{consists}} of two naphthalene-like structures which are fused by a cyclopentane structure. This cyclopentane {{is not included in}} the aromaticity of the molecule. BjF can be obtained when either 2-(1-chloroethenyl)benzocphenanthrene or 6-(1-chloroethenyl)chrysene is treated by flash vacuum thermolysis (FVT) at high temperatures (>900 °C) followed by ring rearrangements (ring contraction/expansion) to selectively yield BjF. <b>Benzokfluoranthene</b> may also be converted via similar processes to BjF by FVT at temperatures ≥ 1100 °C (6% yield) or ≥ 1200 °C (11% yield) with 38% mass recovery.|$|E
5000|$|Figure 2 {{gives an}} example from the {{literature}} in which the BGIT was used to corroborate experimental evidence of the enthalpy of formation of <b>benzokfluoranthene.</b> [...] The experimental value {{was determined to be}} 296.6 kJ/mole {{with a standard deviation of}} 6.4 kJ/mole. This is within the error of the BGIT and is in good agreement with the calculated value. Notice that the carbons at the fused rings are treated differently than regular benzene carbons. [...] Not only can the BGIT be used to confirm experimental values but can also be used to confirm theoretical values.|$|E
50|$|Benzojfluoranthene is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the chemical formula C20H12. Classified as a {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH), it is a colourless solid that is poorly soluble in most solvents. Impure samples can appear off white. Closely related isomeric compounds include benzo(a)fluoranthene (BaF), benzo(b)fluoranthene (BbF), benzo(e)fluoranthene (BeF), and <b>benzo(k)fluoranthene</b> (BkF). BjF is present in fossil fuels and is released during incomplete combustion of organic matter. It has been traced in the smoke of cigarettes, exhaust from gasoline engines, emissions from the combustion of various types of coal and emissions from oil heating, {{as well as an}} impurity in some oils such as soybean oil. More than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs, including the benzofluoranthenes.|$|E
5000|$|Historical {{deposition}} of coal ash used for residential, commercial, and industrial heating, {{as well as}} for industrial processes such as ore smelting, were a common source of contamination in areas that were industrialized before about 1960. Coal naturally concentrates lead and zinc during its formation, as well as other heavy metals to a lesser degree. When the coal is burned, most of these metals become concentrated in the ash (the principal exception being mercury). Coal ash and slag may contain sufficient lead to qualify as a [...] "characteristic hazardous waste", defined in the USA as containing more than 5 mg/l of extractable lead using the TCLP procedure. In addition to lead, coal ash typically contains variable but significant concentrations of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; e.g., benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, <b>benzo(k)fluoranthene,</b> benzo(a)pyrene, indeno(cd)pyrene, phenanthrene, anthracene, and others). These PAHs are known human carcinogens and the acceptable concentrations of them in soil are typically around 1 mg/kg. Coal ash and slag can be recognised by the presence of off-white grains in soil, gray heterogeneous soil, or (coal slag) bubbly, vesicular pebble-sized grains.|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{our results}} {{highlight}} {{the fact that}} the heart beat rate may be considered a good marker of general stress, but not a good endpoint for the identification of specific toxicological patterns. It was shown that several PAHs (phenanthrene, naphthalene and <b>benzo(k)fluoranthene)</b> may induce a general bradycardia in zebrafish embryos and defects in the heart structure [71, 72], but also heavy metals for example may exhibit cardiovascular disturbance as heart underdevelopment and, in extreme cases, absence of cardiac muscles [53].|$|E
