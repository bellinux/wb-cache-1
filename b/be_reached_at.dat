5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Soviet proposal, Macmillan met with Eisenhower at Camp David {{to devise a}} response. The Anglo-American counterproposal agreed to ban small {{underground}} tests (those under magnitude 4.75) on a temporary basis (a duration of roughly 1 year, versus the Soviet proposal of 4–5 years), but this could only happen after verifiable tests had been banned and a seismic research group (the Seismic Research Program Advisory Group) convened. The Soviet Union responded positively to the counterproposal and the research group convened on 11 May 1960. The Soviet Union also offered to keep an underground ban out of the treaty under negotiation. In May 1960, there were high hopes that an agreement would <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>at</b> an upcoming summit of Eisenhower, Khrushchev, Macmillan, and Charles de Gaulle of France in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The line crosses into Bærum, but {{the entire}} metro system is within a single fare zone. Ticket {{machines}} are available at all stations, and the system is operated with a proof-of-payment system.

Transfer to Ruter buses can be made at Majorstuen, Smestad, Hovseter, Røa and Eiksmarka. Transfer to the Oslo Tramway can be made at Majorstuen to lines 11, 12 and 19, serving the Briskeby Line, the Homansbyen Line, and the Frogner Line.

25|$|Two councillors {{held the}} weekly {{audience}} in which petitioners and lawyers presented documents for the cases the court heard. Generally one councillor was {{charged by the}} president {{to hear the case}} as a judge-commissioner in evidentiary hearings, called the enqueste, while another councillor (rapporteur) reported the case to the full court for its deliberations (a quorum of seven councillors was required for a valid deliberation). Individual councillors informally acted as mediators between parties to promote settlements (which could <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>at</b> any stage of a case before the final verdict).|$|E

25|$|However, this {{experience}} {{would prove to}} be profitable for the future Spanish overseas expansion, because as the Spaniards were excluded from the lands discovered or to be discovered from the Canaries southward—and consequently from the road to India around Africa— they sponsored the voyage of Columbus towards the west (1492) in search of Asia to trade in its spices, encountering the Americas instead. Thus, the limitations imposed by the Alcáçovas treaty were overcome and a new and more balanced world's division would <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>at</b> Tordesillas between both emerging maritime powers.|$|E
25|$|When {{there is}} a high {{temperature}} differential (e.g., when an air-source heat pump is used to heat a house with an outside temperature of, say, 0°C (32°F)), it takes more work to move the same amount of heat to indoors than on a milder day. Ultimately, due to Carnot efficiency limits, the heat pump's performance will decrease as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases (outside temperature gets colder), reaching a theoretical limit of 1.0 at −273°C. In practice, a COP of 1.0 will typically <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>at</b> an outdoor temperature around −18°C (0°F) for air source heat pumps.|$|E

2500|$|Two columns on {{the right}} flank were to be formed by the 101st Brigade (Brigadier-General R. C.

The two columns on the left flank were from the 102nd (Tyneside Scottish) Brigade (Brigadier-General T. P. B.
