50|$|The <b>bronze</b> <b>mannikin</b> or bronze munia (Lonchura cucullata) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} (i.e. perching) bird of the Afrotropics. This very social estrildid finch is {{an uncommon}} to locally abundant bird in much of Africa south of the Sahara Desert, where it is resident, nomadic or irruptive in mesic savanna or forest margin habitats. It has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 8,100,000 km². It is the smallest and most widespread of four munia species on the African mainland, the other being black-and-white, red-backed and magpie mannikin. It co-occurs with the Madagascan mannikin on the Comoro Islands, and was introduced to Puerto Rico. Especially in the West Africa, it is considered a pest in grain and rice fields. It is locally trapped for the pet bird trade.|$|E

50|$|The <b>bronze</b> <b>mannikin</b> {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} munia species, measuring 9-10 cm in length and weighing 7-12 grams. The adult is a compact bird with a short black tail, and stubby black and pale grey (not distinctly bluish) mandibles. It is black to brownish black on the head, chin, throat and center of the chest, with some purple-green iridescence on the face and sides of the breast. It has greyish brown upper parts and white underparts with irregular barring on the flanks and rump. A small green iridescent patch is present on the outer scapular feathers, besides, especially in the western race, the sides of the lower breast. Wing coverts and remiges are bordered in a paler or warmer tone. The sexes are similar. Immature birds are dun brown above with buff head and underpart plumage. They moult into full adult plumage by age six months, when the males also begin to sing and exhibit breeding behaviour.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bronze</b> <b>mannikin</b> {{is a tiny}} {{gregarious bird}} which feeds mainly on seeds, {{including}} wild grass seeds, millet, rice and grain. Alternatively termites, nectar or strands of algae may also be eaten. This species {{has a number of}} calls including a rreep-rreeep in flight, a twittering when perched, consisting of various wheezy or buzzing notes. The song is a concatenated and somewhat repetitive series of notes. Before going to roost at nightfall, they usually visit a watering hole where vegetation is hanging into the water. They roost at night in ball-shaped nests, which in the non-breeding season are built solely for this purpose. These slovenly communal roosting nests are dismantled (for reuse of material) and rebuilt almost daily at the same or a new location, in a communal effort. Each party, numbering 8 to 20 birds, seems to be dominated by a single adult male. The flock defends the immediate vicinity of a nest against intruders, but newcomers to a flock are easily accepted. They may associate with waxbill or other mannikin species, and may also use their vacated nests. Pairs often allopreen.|$|E
40|$|Summary This paper investigates, through {{experiments}} using surrogate predators, {{differences in}} intraspecific alarm calls between familiar and unfamiliar <b>Bronze</b> <b>Mannikin</b> Spermestes cucculatus groups. Four groups of mannikins were captured with mist nets from four areas in Durban (i. e. original groups) and randomly mixed (i. e. assorted groups). These groups {{were exposed to}} latex terrestrial snakes and mounted aerial raptors, and their alarm calls and predator response behaviours recorded. The Bronze Mannikins were able to discriminate between predators of different sizes, and increased their calling rate and decreased the end frequency of the alarm call in response to larger predators. This perhaps signalled increased threat, while simultaneously decreasing the conspicuousness of the flock. When the alarm call structure of the original and assorted groups in response to both raptors and snakes was compared, birds in original groups called more often, but paused longer between calls. Anti-predator behaviour differed in that assorted groups were less vigilant and aggressive toward the predators and panicked more frequently. In these groups, a failure to transfer the predation threat information might have caused the group to stop behaving cohesively and reliably. The manipulated experiments carried out in this study indicated that Bronze Mannikins were able to communicate predator size risk to conspecifics, but not as successfully to unfamiliar group members, showing that the investment, probability through altruistic payback, is greater in stable groups...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2008. Alarm or warning vocalizations are {{produced}} by many animals when they detect a potential predator. However {{little is known about}} the information contained in these vocalizations. This study investigated the warning vocalisations of three passerine species, viz. the Buff-streaked Chat Oenanthe bifasciata, the Stonechat Saxicola torquata and the <b>Bronze</b> <b>Mannikin</b> Spermestes cucullatus. The study investigated whether the alarm calls for terrestrial predators differ in their acoustic structure from alarm calls emitted for aerial predators. Birds were exposed to latex terrestrial snakes and mounted aerial raptors, while changes in six acoustic parameters of alarm calls were measured. Bronze Mannikins were investigated for differences in intra-specific alarm calls between familiar and unfamiliar group members by capturing wild groups of mannikins and randomly mixing these to form assorted groups. Bronze Mannikins emitting warning calls were able to discriminate differences in predator size, and increased their calling rate and decreased the end frequency of the alarm call in response to larger predators. This may be the caller’s response to increased threat or variation in frequency may obscure cues to the caller’s whereabouts. Assorted group members were less aggressive to predator models than original members and panicked more during confrontations. Hence the unfamiliarity of the caller may have disrupted group cohesion. The alarm call acoustics of the social Buff-streaked Chats and the solitary Stonechat were compared to examine the effect of group-living on alarm behaviour. Snakes elicited louder calls from both the chat species than raptors. Louder and collectively more vocal social groups might be more successful in discouraging attacks than an asocial species. Variation in amplitude and call frequencies by the Stonechat provided some evidence that they are equally adapted to identifying predator type. Although Buff-streaked Chats increased their call rate in response to nearby predator models, Stonechats produced shorter calls in response to terrestrial predation particularly when the predators were in close proximity. Knowledge gained through direct encounters with predators or the ease with which raptors and snakes can gain access to nests may have played a part in discrimination of predator threat. Overall this study indicated strong correlations between some alarm acoustic parameters and predator size as well as the degree of threat...|$|E
