5|$|After {{several months}} of growing {{steadily}} weaker and undergoing treatment from Dr Sim Ki Ay, {{on the evening of}} 17November 1948 Oerip collapsed and died from a heart attack in his room in Yogyakarta. After a night-long viewing he was <b>buried</b> <b>the</b> next day in Semaki Heroes' Cemetery and posthumously promoted to general. When Sudirman threatened to resign in 1949, he blamed Oerip's death– as well as his own tuberculosis– on the government's inconsistency during the revolution. Oerip was survived by his wife and adopted daughter. Abby died of malaria in January 1951, and Rohmah died on 29October 1977 in Semarang; she was buried in Ungaran.|$|E
5|$|An {{epidemic}} of dysentery broke {{out on the}} Kokoda Track that threatened the entire force. Some 1,200 casualties, mostly dysentery, reached Ilolo in September. Simple hygiene procedures involving the disposal of rubbish and excrement were required, but were neglected {{in the early stages}} of the campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford arranged for supplies of a new drug, sulphaguanidine, to be shipped from Australia. The widespread use of a scarce drug was a gamble, as it used up all the stocks in Australia, but one that paid off; it arrested the epidemic, and allowed sick men to travel, thereby saving lives. When the Australians advanced on Kokoda in October, special details constructed latrines, <b>buried</b> <b>the</b> dead, and, in extreme cases, burned villages that the Japanese had fouled beyond redemption.|$|E
