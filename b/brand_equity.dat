500|$|Two {{professors at}} the Goizueta Business School at Emory University {{summarized}} their research in a New York Times editorial. They found that studies of college {{teams that have}} changed their names and mascots indicate that doing so has a long-term financial benefit. While vocal opponents of change often threatened withdrawal of support, this never materialized. There have been no name changes by professional teams, though a comparison of NFL teams shows the highest negative trend in <b>brand</b> <b>equity</b> affects the Washington Redskins and the Kansas City Chiefs, calling into question the business logic of retaining Native American names or logos that are offensive to even a minority. In a commentary for Forbes, Tom Van Riper states that research specifically considering the fan loyalty and traditions of the team indicates {{that the value of}} the name as a brand is significant, and unlikely to change for business reasons. An alternative opinion is that the team would benefit from a re-branding, but any new name would need to be carefully selected. In 2014 sales of Redskins merchandise declined 35% from the prior year. [...] "People are having a second thoughts about wearing a T-shirt with the logo or name that it has now been called racist," [...] said Matt Powell, senior analyst for SportsSourceOne. A team spokesman attributed the decline to dismal performance in the 2013 season, but other teams with bad records have not seen such a steep decline in sales. Corporate sponsors have either made no public response to media inquiries regarding the name or stated that they play no role in the decision, and defer to the team and the NFL. Despite the name controversy, the value of the team has risen $700 million to $2.4 billion (40%), making them the third most valuable franchise in the NFL, based upon the valuations published by Forbes magazine in 2014 and 2015.|$|E
