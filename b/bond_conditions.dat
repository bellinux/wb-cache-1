Two days later, on November 16, Biron was awaiting a probable cause hearing to determine whether there was enough evidence against her to put her on trial on the state charges when FBI agents entered the courtroom and whisked her to the federal courthouse in Concord. There, she appeared before federal magistrate judge Landya McCafferty and was arraigned on the federal charges. Federal prosecutors told McCafferty that Biron had openly flouted her <b>bond</b> <b>conditions.</b> She had not only placed an ad on Craigslist, but had somehow acquired 200 rounds of ammunition and had been seen having sex and using marijuana, ecstasy and cocaine on several occasions—in some cases around children. She'd also sent a threatening text message to Ore and had asked people to lie to investigators. Combined with other evidence, McCafferty ordered Biron jailed without bond, saying that while she was not a flight risk, [...] "there are no conditions or combination of conditions of release that will reasonably assure the safety of the community." [...] On January 3, 2013, an additional charge of child exploitation was added in a superseding indictment.

30|$|The load {{performance}} of CFRP-strengthened RC highway bridges {{is a function}} of the bond-interface behavior in the CFRP laminate–epoxy–concrete structural system. It is necessary to periodically evaluate the <b>bond</b> <b>condition</b> of the CFRP laminates applied to bridges to monitor potential changes (deteriorations) in bridge load performance. For transportation infrastructure owners, and in particular owners of highway bridges strengthened with CFRP systems, one primary concern is the long-term durability of the CFRP systems and sustainment of the designed bridge load capacity. Bridge owners are faced with two primary questions: (1) how do CFRP structural systems on RC highway bridges perform over extended time (15 + years) under the influence of frequent cyclic loading (heavy truck traffic), moisture, and freeze-thaw cycles? (2) How can accurate field data be obtained on CFRP-plate <b>bond</b> <b>condition</b> to evaluate changes in load performance and to establish cost-effective maintenance procedures? This concern is magnified when a national highway system has a large number of strengthened bridges and the load {{performance of}} the bridges is critically dependent on the CFRP plate–concrete bond performance, i.e., absence of de-bonding. CFRP plates with de-laminations can potentially produce deterioration in bridge performance (Shih et al. 2003). The NDT concept presented in this paper is one method for rapidly evaluating the <b>bond</b> <b>condition</b> of CFRP plates applied to multiple bridges in a national highway system. A comprehensive CFRP-strengthened bridge inspection and maintenance program with periodic testing and evaluation of the CFRP plate <b>bond</b> <b>condition</b> is necessary to support and sustain long-term bridge performance.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a frequency-wavenumber (f-k) domain signal processing approach for guided plate wave data. The guided waves propagate in a steel plate bonded to concrete substrate, and the analysis aims {{to characterize the}} steel-concrete interface. The modal solutions of guided waves in well-bonded, partially bonded, and dis-bonded interface cases are obtained using the Global Matrix technique. The analytical solutions demonstrate that the attenuation characteristics of the fundamental symmetric (S 0) guided wave mode in the steel plate {{are sensitive to the}} steel-concrete interface <b>bond</b> <b>condition.</b> The attenuation behavior of the S 0 mode are captured and extracted from the complete guided wave signal set obtained by air-coupled ultrasonic tests. Using f-k domain signal analysis, the fundamental anti-symmetric (A 0) mode is suppressed and the S 0 mode is isolated. The S 0 mode attenuation across the scanned spatial points is then estimated and used to characterize the <b>bond</b> <b>condition</b> of the steel-concrete interface. This signal processing approach is verified by a series of numerical simulation and laboratory-scale experiments.
