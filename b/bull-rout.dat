50|$|Myoxocephalus scorpius, known {{variously}} as the shorthorn sculpin, short-spined sea scorpion, bull-head, <b>bull-rout</b> and the father-lasher, is a {{demersal fish}} of the Northern Atlantic and adjacent subarctic coasts, {{and of the}} Arctic including the coasts of Alaska and Siberia. It reaches maturity at 15 - 30 cm in length and specimens from the Arctic and subarctic, which grow to the largest size, can reach up to 60 cm. The fish has a squat appearance, a large spiny head and a tapering body. It is a mottled grey-brown in colour but can be darker, including black as base coloring. It has a large mouth and spiny gill covers.|$|E
40|$|Cystacanth {{stages of}} three Corynosoma (Acanthocephala) species, C. strumosum and C. semerme, {{and a new}} species in the Bothnian Bay, C. magdaleni, were studied in the fourhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus quadricornis) in 1996 - 1997. The length of the trunk and {{proboscis}} differentiated the three species in the fish. The stability of the Corynosoma infection was studied by comparing the present results with those collected from the same areas (central and coastal) in 1977 - 1982 (Valtonen, 1983 a). As C. magdaleni and C. strumosum were not separated at that time, the joint infections of these two species (called "C. slrumosum") were compared. The stability of infection with C. semerme in the central Bothnian Bay was noticeable (prevalences were 82. 9 in earlier period and 81. 9 % in later period), while the prevalences of "C. strumosum" in the same areas had decreased (21 and 1 3. 5 %, respectively). This is suggested {{to be due to}} the disappearance of the marine <b>bull-rout,</b> Myoxocephalus scorpius, from the Bothnian Bay during the 1990 s due to an overall decline in salinity throughout the Baltic Sea. In the coastal area Corynosoma infection was clearly lower than in central area in both periods...|$|E
40|$|Catches of {{demersal}} fish from research vessel surveys in three {{areas around the}} British Isles from 1901 to 1907 were compared with survey catches in the same areas from 1989 to 1997. Mesh size and other characteristics of the trawls used suggested {{that some of these}} data were comparable, and could be used to describe changes in {{demersal fish}} assemblages over the last 80 years. In Start Bay (NW English Channel) and the Irish Sea, species diversity was the same in both periods, although the most abundant species in each period were not the same. In English coastal regions of the southern North Sea, fish populations became more diverse, as plaice Pleuronectes platessa and whiting Merlangius merlangus became less abundant, and the relative abundance of several non-target species such as dragonet Callionymus spp., bib Trisopterus luscus, and <b>bull-rout</b> Myoxocephalus scorpius increased. The proportion in the catch of small fish species (maximum body length 30 cm) in catches decreased in all regions during the time period, except in the Irish Sea where plaice replaced grey gurnard Eutrigla gurnardus as a dominant species. There was a decline in abundance of large sharks, skates and rays, including the common skate, Raja batis, white skate R. alba and the angel shark Squatina squatina. During historic surveys, 60 % of the elasmobranch fauna consisted of thornback ray Raja clavata, whereas in contemporary surveys the lesser spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula was the most abundant elasmobranch. Changes in length-frequency distribution of fish in both target and non-target categories, and other observed changes, were thought to be a response to commercial exploitation, and corresponded to similar observations recorded elsewhere.
