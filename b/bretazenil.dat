50|$|In a {{study in}} rats {{cross-tolerance}} between the benzodiazepine drug chlordiazepoxide and <b>bretazenil</b> has been demonstrated. In a primate study <b>bretazenil</b> {{was found to be}} able to replace the full agonist diazepam in diazepam dependent primates without precipitating withdrawal effects, demonstrating cross tolerance between <b>bretazenil</b> and benzodiazepine agonists, whereas other partial agonists precipitated a withdrawal syndrome. The differences are likely due to differences in instrinsic properties between different benzodiazepine partial agonists. Cross-tolerance has also been shown between <b>bretazenil</b> and full agonist benzodiazepines in rats. In rats tolerance is slower to develop to the anticonvulsant effects compared to the benzodiazepine site full agonist diazepam.

The partial agonist imidazenil does not, however, act at these subunits. The approximate equivalent dose of <b>bretazenil</b> is 0.5 mg of <b>bretazenil</b> is equivalent to ounced psychomotor-impairing effect than diazepam. <b>Bretazenil</b> produces marked sedative-hypnotic effects when taken alone and when combined with alcohol. This human study also indicates that <b>bretazenil</b> is possibly more sedative than diazepam. The reason is unknown, but the study suggests the possibility that a full-agonist metabolite may be generated in humans but not animals previously tested or else that there are significant differences in benzodiazepine receptor population in animals and humans.|$|E
50|$|Partial {{agonists}} of benzodiazepine receptors {{have been}} proposed as a possible alternative to full agonists of the benzodiazepine site to overcome the problems of tolerance, dependence and withdrawal which limits the role of benzodiazepines {{in the treatment of}} anxiety, insomnia and epilepsy.

50|$|<b>Bretazenil</b> was {{originally}} developed as an anti-anxiety drug {{and has been}} studied for its use as an anticonvulsant but has never commercialised.

50|$|<b>Bretazenil</b> (Ro16-6028) is an imidazopyrrolobenzodiazepine {{anxiolytic}} drug {{which is}} derived from the benzodiazepine family, and was invented in 1988. It is most closely related in structure to the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, although its effects are somewhat different. It is classed as a high-potency benzodiazepine due to its high affinity binding to benzodiazepine binding sites where it acts as a partial agonist. Its profile as a partial agonist and preclinical trial data suggests that it may have a reduced adverse effect profile. In particular <b>bretazenil</b> has been proposed to cause a less strong development of tolerance and withdrawal syndrome. <b>Bretazenil</b> differs from traditional 1,4-benzodiazepines by being a partial agonist and because it binds to α1, α2, α3, α4, α5 and α6 subunit containing GABAA receptor benzodiazepine receptor complexes. 1,4-benzodiazepines bind only to α1, α2, α3 and α5 GABAA benzodiazepine receptor complexes.|$|E

For instance, <b>bretazenil</b> modulatory efficacy is much lower than that of diazepam. Such low efficacy could be due either to a preferential modulation of specific GABAA receptor subtypes or to a low modulatory efficacy at every GABAA receptor subtype. To address these questions we studied drug-induced modifications of GABA-activated Cl- currents in native GABAA receptors of cortical neurons in primary cultures and in recombinant GABAA receptors transiently expressed in transformed human embryonic kidney cells (293) after transfection with cDNAs encoding different molecular forms of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits of GABAA receptors.

40|$|Long-term {{treatment}} of rats with full (triazolam) or selective (diazepam) allosteric modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors rapidly induced tolerance to the protective {{effect of these}} drugs against bicuculline-induced convulsion. In contrast, long-term administration of partial allosteric modulators (imidazenil and <b>bretazenil)</b> of GABAA receptors, in doses equipotent to those of diazepam and triazolam that induce anticonvulsant tolerance, failed to elicit such a tolerance. Furthermore, no cross-tolerance was observed between diazepam and imidazenil. Discontinuation of long-term treatment with diazepam or triazolam, but not of long-term treatment with imidazenil or <b>bretazenil,</b> sensitized rats to behavioral inhibition by punishment (electric shock) {{in a manner that}} was potentiated by flumazenil. Administration of a single oral dose of [14 C]diazepam or [3 H] imidazenil to rats treated repeatedly with the corresponding unlabeled drug or vehicle revealed that the brain concentrations of drugs and their metabolites were similar in both groups of animals. This suggests that tolerance to the full or selective allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors may be associated with changes in the efficacy of the allosteric modulation rather than with changes in drug metabolism.

The maximum potentiation by divaplon was only 28 ± 5 % and 21 ± 9 % of that of flunitra-zepam at the respective subunit combinations.

40|$|Positive {{allosteric}} modulators of {{gamma-aminobutyric acid}} (GABA) A receptors, including benzodiazepines and congeners, {{can be classified}} into three categories: 1) full allosteric modulators (i. e., triazolam and alprazolam) that act with high potency and efficacy at many GABAA receptors; 2) selective allosteric modulators (i. e., diazepam) that act with high potency and high efficacy at selected GABAA receptors; and 3) partial allosteric modulators (i. e., <b>bretazenil)</b> that act with high potency but low efficacy at many GABAA receptors. Imidazenil, an imidazobenzodiazepine carboxamide, has been characterized as a novel representative of the partial allosteric modulator class. When tested on a broad spectrum (native and recombinant) of GABAA receptors, imidazenil positively modulates the GABA-elicited Cl- currents with a 4 - to 5 -fold higher potency but an efficacy (30 - 50 %) {{lower than that of}} diazepam, and it antagonizes the effects of the latter drug. Imidazenil in vitro (Ki = 5 x 10 (- 10) M) and in vivo (ID 50 = 0. 2 mumol/kg i. v.) displaces [3 H]flumazenil from its brain binding sites and in vivo it possesses a marked anticonflict profile in the rat Vogel conflict-punishment test and is 10 times more potent than <b>bretazenil</b> and 100 times more potent than diazepam or alprazolam in antagonizing bicuculline- and pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. Unlike diazepam and alprazolam, which induce sedation and ataxia and potentiate the effects of ethanol and thiopental at doses similar to those that produce anticonflict effects and occupy 50 % of brain flumazenil binding sites, imidazenil does not produce ataxia or sedation in rats nor does it potentiate the effects of ethanol or thiopental in doses 30 - to 50 -fold higher than those required for the anticonflict effect and for 100 % occupancy of brain flumazenil binding sites. Furthermore, when administered with diazepam, imidazenil blocks in a dose-related fashion the sedative, ataxic effects of this drug and thus acts on these unwanted responses as an antagonist (i. e., like flumazenil). In all tests, imidazenil has the pharmacological profile of a partial allosteric modulator, but is more potent than <b>bretazenil,</b> has a longer biological half-life and, in rodents, is virtually unable to cause sedation, ataxia or to potentiate ethanol toxicity...|$|E

This showed clear developmental downregulation {{of the effects of}} <b>bretazenil</b> (1 μm) and marked upregulation of the effect of 100 nm of zolpidem on the decay of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs). Given the concentrations used we interpret this as downregulation of the synaptic α 3 and upregulation of α 1 subunit. Furthermore, the effect of furosemide, being indicative of the functional contribution of α 4, was increased between postnatal days 6 and 21. Our second aim was to study the effects of plasticity in α subunit expression on decay properties of GABAergic IPSCs. We found that bretazenil-sensitive IPSCs have the longest decay time constant in juvenile neurons. In mature neurons, zolpidem- and furosemide-sensitive IPSCs have relatively fast decay kinetics, whereas bretazenil-sensitive IPSCs decay relatively slowly. Analysis of α 1 deficient mice and α 1 antisense oligonucleotide deletion in rat explants showed similar results to those obtained by zolpidem application. Thus, distinct α subunit contributions create heterogeneity in developmental acceleration of IPSC decay in neocortex...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that alpha 1 -containing GABA(A) receptors mediate the sedative, amnestic, {{and to some extent}} the anticonvulsant actions of non-selective benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor ligands, such as diazepam (DZ). Anxiolytic and in part, anticonvulsant actions of BZ ligands are mediated by alpha 2 -, alpha 3 -, and alpha 5 -containing GABA(A) receptors. This has resulted in increasing interest in developing BZ ligands with selective actions at GABA(A) receptors, including alpha 2 -, alpha 3 -, and alpha 5 -subunits, but devoid of efficacy at alpha 1 -containing receptors. To refine their spectrum of pharmacological actions, efforts are being made to minimize unwanted effects such as sedation, amnesia, and tolerance liabilities. A prototype for such BZ ligands is imidazenil (IMD), an imidazo-benzodiazepine carboxylic acid derivative that elicits potent anticonvulsant and anxiolytic actions at doses virtually devoid of sedative, cardio-respiratory depressant and amnestic effects, and anticonvulsant tolerance liability. To define the pharmacological profile of IMD and its derivatives, we compared the anticonflict (anxiolytic), anti-proconflict (antipanic), anti-bicuculline (BIC), and maximal electroshock seizure (MES) effects, and the suppression of locomotor activity by imidazo-benzodiazepine carboxylic acid derivatives to those of DZ and <b>bretazenil</b> (BTZ). We report here that IMD and one of its derivatives (RO 25 - 2775) possess dose-dependent anticonflict, anti-proconflict, and anti-BIC actions but failed to suppress locomotor activity. Like DZ, the other IMD derivatives (enazenil, RO 25 - 2776, and RO 25 - 2847) not only elicit dose-dependent anticonflict, anti-proconflict, anti-BIC, anti-MES effects but also suppress locomotor activity. In contrast, none of the IMD derivatives studied shows any similarity to BTZ, which elicits anticonflict, anti-proconflict actions and suppresses locomotor activity but is virtually inactive against BIC-induced tonic-clonic convulsions...|$|E
40|$|A {{histidine}} residue in the N-terminal extracellular {{region of}} α 1, 2, 3, 5 subunits {{of the human}} GABAA receptor, which is replaced by an arginine in α 4 and α 6 subunits, is a major determinant for high affinity binding of classical benzodiazepine (BZ) -site ligands. The effect of mutating this histidine at position 105 in the α 5 subunit to an arginine (α 5 H 105 R) on BZ-site pharmacology has been investigated using radioligand binding on HEK 293 and L(tk-) cells and two electrode voltage clamp recording on Xenopus oocytes in which GABAA receptors of subtypes α 5, α 5 H 105 R, α 4 and α 6 were co-expressed with β 3 γ 2 s. The classical BZs, diazepam and flunitrazepam (full agonists on the α 5 receptor) showed negligible affinity and therefore negligible efficacy on α 5 H 105 R receptors. The β-carbolines DMCM and βCCE (inverse agonists on the α 5 receptor) retained some affinity but did not exhibit inverse agonist efficacy at α 5 H 105 R receptors. Therefore, the α 5 H 105 R mutation confers an α 4 /α 6 -like pharmacology to the classical BZs and β-carbolines. Ro 15 - 4513, flumazenil, <b>bretazenil</b> and FG 8094, which share a common imidazobenzodiazepine core structure, retained high affinity and were higher efficacy agonists on α 5 H 105 R receptors than would be predicted from an α 4 /α 6 pharmacological profile. This effect was antagonized by DMCM, which competes for the BZ-site and therefore {{is likely to be}} mediated via the BZ-site. These data indicate that the conserved histidine residue in the α subunit is not only a key determinant in the affinity of BZ-site ligands on α 5 containing GABAA receptors, but also influences ligand efficacy...|$|E
40|$|As an {{approach}} to understanding {{the role of the}} α 1 subunit of the GABAA receptor, ribozymes were designed to reduce expression of this subunit protein by hydrolysis of α 1 subunit message and antisense inactivation. The ribozyme cleavage sites were selected through homology comparison of all known murine GABAA receptor subunits at the amino acid and nucleotide sequence level. Two ribozymes were designed and synthesized: one against the extracellular domain and the other against the cytoplasmic domain. These ribozymes were cloned in a mammalian expression plasmid, pZeoSV 2 (+). Cleavage of both extracellular and cytoplasmic domain transcripts by the respective ribozymes was observed when each ribozyme was tested against in vitro transcribed mRNA. The stable cell line, 122, expressing recombinant human GABAA α 1, β 2 and γ 2 S subunits of receptor was stably transfected with the cytoplasmic domain ribozyme (cy) alone and with both the cytoplasmic (cy) and extracellular domain (ex) ribozyme expression plasmids. Northern analysis showed a 55 – 60 % reduction of α 1 mRNA in clones of cells transfected with either the single ribozyme (Cy) or with both ribozymes (EC). The α 1 protein level was reduced 75 % in a stable Cy clone and more than 90 % in a stable EC clone when compared with α 1 expression in 122 cells and the vector transfected (Zeo) cells. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that the GABAA receptor properties were very similar in 122 cells and in stable clones in which the subunit protein expression had been greatly reduced. No significant difference was detected in the potentiation of the receptor response by either <b>bretazenil</b> or zolpidem. These data demonstrate the efficacy of the ribozyme approach in dramatically reducing GABAA subunit protein levels in transfected cells and identify those elements that will be important to the application of similar ribozymes to knock-down transmitter receptor subunit proteins under inducible promoters in transgenic mice...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacology}} of {{the stable}} cell line expressing human α 4 β 3 δ GABAA receptor was investigated using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques. α 4 β 3 δ receptors exhibited increased sensitivity to GABA {{when compared to}} α 4 β 3 γ 2 receptors, with EC 50 's of 0. 50 (0. 46, 0. 53) μM and 2. 6 (2. 5, 2. 6) μM respectively. Additionally, the GABA partial agonists piperidine- 4 -sulphonate (P 4 S) and 4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydroisothiazolo-[5, 4 -c]pyridin- 3 -ol (THIP) displayed markedly higher efficacy at α 4 β 3 δ receptors, indeed THIP demonstrated greater efficacy than GABA at these receptors. The δ subunit conferred slow desensitization to GABA, with rate constants of 4. 8 ± 0. 5 s for α 4 β 3 δ and 2. 5 ± 0. 2 s for α 4 β 3 γ 2. However, both P 4 S and THIP demonstrated similar levels of desensitization on both receptor subtypes suggesting this effect is agonist specific. α 4 β 3 δ and α 4 β 3 γ 2 demonstrated equal sensitivity to inhibition by the cation zinc (2 – 3 μM IC 50). However, α 4 β 3 δ receptors demonstrated greater sensitivity to inhibition by lanthanum. The IC 50 for GABA antagonists SR- 95531 and picrotoxin, was similar for α 4 β 3 δ and α 4 β 3 γ 2. Likewise, inhibition was observed on both subtypes at high and low pH. α 4 β 3 δ receptors were insensitive to modulation by benzodiazepine ligands. In contrast Ro 15 - 4513 and <b>bretazenil</b> potentiated GABA responses on α 4 β 3 γ 2 cells, and the inverse agonist DMCM showed allosteric inhibition of α 4 β 3 γ 2 receptors. The efficacy of neurosteroids at α 4 β 3 δ receptors was greatly enhanced over that observed at α 4 β 3 γ 2 receptors. The greatest effect was observed using THDOC with 524 ± 71. 6 % potentiation at α 4 β 3 δ and 297. 9 ± 49. 7 % at α 4 β 3 γ 2 receptors. Inhibition by the steroid pregnenolone sulphate however, showed no subtype selectivity. The efficacy of both pentobarbitone and propofol was slightly augmented and etomidate greatly enhanced at α 4 β 3 δ receptors versus α 4 β 3 γ 2 receptors. We show that the α 4 β 3 δ receptor has a distinct pharmacology and kinetic profile. With its restricted distribution within the brain and unique pharmacology this receptor may {{play an important role}} in the action of neurosteroids and anaesthetics...|$|E
40|$|GABAA receptors {{composed}} of a 1, ß 2, ? 1 subunits are expressed {{in only a few}} areas of the brain and thus represent interesting drug targets. The pharmacological properties of this receptor subtype, however, are largely unknown. In the present study, we expressed a 1 ß 2 ? 1 -GABAA receptors in Xenopus laevis oocytes and analyzed their modulation by 21 ligands from 12 structural classes making use of the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp method and a fast perfusion system. Modulation of GABA-induced chloride currents (IGABA) was studied at GABA concentrations eliciting 5 to 10 % of the maximal response. Triazolam, clotiazepam, midazolam, 2 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) - 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 - octahydro-cyclohepta-(b) pyrazolo[4, 3 -d]pyridin- 3 -one (CGS 20625), 2 -(4 -chlorophenyl) -pyrazolo[4, 3 -c]quinolin- 3 -one (CGS 9896), diazepam, zolpidem, and <b>bretazenil</b> at 1 M concentrations were able to significantly (> 20 %) enhance IGABA in a 1 ß 2 ? 1 receptors. Methyl- 6, 7 -dimethoxy- 4 -ethyl-ß-carboline- 3 - carboxylate, 3 -methyl- 6 -[3 -trifluoromethyl-phenyl]- 1, 2, 4 -triazolo[4, 3 -b] pyridazine (Cl 218, 872), clobazam, flumazenil, 5 -(6 -ethyl- 7 -methoxy- 5 - methylimidazo[1, 2 -a]pyrimidin- 2 -yl) - 3 -methyl-[1, 2, 4]-oxadiazole (Ru 33203), 2 -phenyl- 4 -(3 -ethyl-piperidinyl) -quinoline (PK 9084), flurazepam, ethyl- 7 -methoxy- 11, 12, 13, 13 a-tetrahydro- 9 -oxo- 9 H-imidazo[1, 5 -a]pyrrolo[2, 1 -c] [1, 4]benzodiazepine- 1 -carboxylate (L- 655, 708), 2 -(6 -ethyl- 7 -methoxy- 5 - methylimidazo[1, 2 -a]pyrimidin- 2 -yl) - 4 -methyl-thiazole (Ru 33356), and 6 -ethyl- 7 -methoxy- 5 -methylimidazo[1, 2 -a]pyrimidin- 2 -yl) phenylmethanone (Ru 32698) (1 M each) had no significant effect, and flunitrazepam and 2 -phenyl- 4 -(4 -ethyl-piperidinyl) -quinoline (PK 8165) inhibited IGABA. The most potent compounds triazolam, clotiazepam, midazolam, and CGS 20625 were investigated in more detail on a 1 ß 2 ? 1 and a 1 ß 2 ? 2 S receptors. The potency and efficiency of these compounds for modulating I GABA was smaller for a 1 ß 2 ? 1 than for a 1 ß 2 ? 2 S receptors, and their effects on a 1 ß 2 ? 1 could not be blocked by flumazenil. CGS 20625 displayed the highest efficiency by enhancing at 100 M IGABA (a 1 ß 2 ? 2) by 775  17 % versus 526  14 % IGABA (a 1 ß 2 ? 1) and 157  17 % IGABA (a 1 ß 2) (p < 0. 05). These data provide new insight into the pharmacological properties of GABAA receptors containing ? 1 subunits and may aid in the design of specific ligands for this receptor subtype.
