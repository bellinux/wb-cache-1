5|$|The Prosaurolophus-Saurolophus clade {{has been}} a {{problematic}} grouping when trying to place among hadrosaurines.

5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} {{has shown that}} certain mallards appear to <b>be</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> their Indo-Pacific relatives while others are related to their American relatives. Mitochondrial DNA data for the D-loop sequence suggests that mallards may have evolved in the general area of Siberia. Mallard bones rather abruptly appear in food remains of ancient humans and other deposits of fossil bones in Europe, without {{a good candidate for}} a local predecessor species. The large ice age palaeosubspecies that made up at least the European and west Asian populations during the Pleistocene has been named Anas platyrhynchos palaeoboschas.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Rougier {{was called}} to the Bar, and the family moved first to Brighton, then to Hove, so that Rougier could easily commute to London. The {{following}} year, they sent their son to a preparatory school, creating an additional expense for Heyer. The Blitz bombing of 1940–41 disrupted train travel in Britain, prompting Heyer and her family to move to London in 1942 so that Rougier would <b>be</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> his work.|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} of neural classifier outputs shows that, {{in case of}} MLP, more the output <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 1 and more this output will <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the identified fault class. Contrarily, more the output <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 0 and more this output will be far to be the identified fault class. In case of RBF, the outputs are distances from RBF centers. In this case with a new scale of outputs it is easily to make output class values varying between [0, c], where c is a constant to be determined (e.g., see Sect.  5.1, Fig.  7 a–c). Then, more the output which is a distance <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> c and more this output will be far {{to be identified as}} fault class. Contrarily, more the output <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 0 and more this output will <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the identified fault class. From this purpose, one interesting way to built efficient decision-making from two neural classifiers is fuzzy logic [18, 19].|$|R
