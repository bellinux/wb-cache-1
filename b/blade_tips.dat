40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{behavior}} of the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> vortices of a wind turbine equipped with a brimmed-diffuser shroud, called a &# 8220;Wind-Lens turbine&# 8221;, we conducted a three-dimensional numerical simulation using a large eddy simulation (LES). Since this unique wind turbine consists of not only rotating blades but also a diffuser shroud with a broad-ring brim at the exit periphery, the flow field around the turbine is highly complex and unsteady. Previously, our research group conducted numerical simulations using an actuator-disc approximation, in which the rotating blades were simply modeled as an external force on the fluid. Therefore, the detailed flow patterns around the rotating blades and the shroud, including the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> vortices, could not be simulated. Instead of an actuator-disc approximation, we used a moving boundary technique in the present CFD simulation to simulate the flow around a rotating blade in order to focus especially on <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> vortices. The simulation results showed a pair of vortices consisting of a <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> vortex and a counter-rotating vortex which was generated between the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> and the inner surface of the diffuser.

40|$|Abstract: The {{application}} of improved <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> geometries is studied {{with the aim}} of identifying an effective design concept for industrial fan passive noise control. The concept developed opti-mizes a datum blade by means of profiled endplates at the tip, reducing fan noise by changing the tip leakage flow behaviour. Experimental and computational investigations have been carried out on a family of axial fans, in fully ducted configuration, to establish the aerodynamic merits of the proposed <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> design concept. The flow mechanisms in the fan tip region are correlated to specific blade design features that promote a reduction of the fan aero-acoustic signature in both tonal and broadband noise components. The tip vortical flow structures are characterized, and their role in creation of overall stage acoustic emissions clarified. The reported research identifies modification of tip geometry as markedly affecting the multiple vortex behaviour of <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> leakage flow by altering the near-wall fluid flow paths on both <b>blade</b> surfaces. <b>Blade</b> <b>tip</b> endplates were also demonstrated to influence the rotor loss behaviour in the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> region.

40|$|Abradable {{seal rubber}} {{has been widely}} used in aero-engine fans to improve their {{efficiency}} by reducing the clearance between rotating and stationary components. To investigate the high-speed scraping behavior between a vulcanized silicone rubber and a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V fan blade and evaluate the abradable performance of seal rubber, abrasion tests were conducted at a <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> velocity of 50 – 300  m/s with an incursion rate of 100  μm/s. The influences of the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> velocity on the wear mechanism and interaction forces were specially analyzed.

With an increase of the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> velocity, both of the final incursion depth and wear mass loss of seal rubber exhibit growth trends. The gradual changes of rubbing forces with an increase of rubbing time are the characteristic of abrasive wear, and force curves with unstable mutations are a reflection of pattern wear. At a constant incursion rate of 100  μm/s, the maximum values of interaction forces decrease first and then grow with an increase of the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> velocity, and the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> velocity of 150  m/s becomes the cut-off point between abrasive wear and pattern wear...|$|R
40|$|By {{applying}} adaptronics to helicopters, i. e. {{by use of}} self-adapting structural components, noise can be suppressed, vibration {{reduced and}} aerodynamic efficiency increased. This thesis investigates two concepts, the adaptive blade root and the adaptive <b>blade</b> <b>tip,</b> allowing direct adaptive shape control of the main rotor areas that are the main sources of helicopter noise and vibration. Both concepts {{are based on the}} introduction of a local twist into the rotor blades. Since non-stationary helicopter aerodynamics and their interaction with the elastic helicopter structure are the main sources for flight envelope boundaries as well as vibration and noise, the comprehension of aerodynamics is essential to effectively influence local airflow conditions and finally evaluate the investigated concepts. With respect to these relations the adaptive blade root and the adaptive <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> are described and evaluated. The adaptive blade root represents a torsional actuator integrated in the rotor blade root that mainly introduces rigid body blade torsion. A torsional actuator integrated in the rotor <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> is realized by the adaptive <b>blade</b> <b>tip.</b> This concept influences the blade twist distribution close to the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> and leads to higher aerodynamic efficiency due to this approach.

40|$|An {{important}} {{challenge facing}} {{the design of}} turbodynamic ventricular assist devices (VADs) intended for long-term support is the optimization of the flow path geometry to maximize hydraulic performance while minimizing shear-stress-induced hemolysis and thrombosis. For unshrouded centrifugal, mixed-flow and axial-flow blood pumps, the complex flow patterns within the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> clearance between the lengthwise upper surface of the rotating impeller blades and the stationary pump housing have a dramatic effect on both the hydrodynamic performance and the blood damage production. Detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses were performed in this study to investigate such flow behavior in <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> clearance region for a centrifugal blood pump representing a scaled-up version of a prototype pediatric VAD. Nominal flow conditions were analyzed at a flow rate of 2. 5 L/min and rotor speed of 3000 rpm with three <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> clearances of 50, 100, and 200 microm. CFD simulations predicted {{a decrease in the}} averaged tip leakage flow rate and an increase in pump head and axial thrust with decreasing <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> clearances from 200 to 50 microm.
