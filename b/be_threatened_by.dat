5|$|Little {{is known}} about the role of A.viridimontanum in the ecosystem. In general, ferns are less {{susceptible}} to herbivory than flowering plants due to higher levels of toxic and distasteful compounds in their foliage. A.viridimontanum is not known to <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> a particular predator or disease.|$|E
5|$|The Tasmanian {{numbfish}} {{is frequently}} caught incidentally by trawlers of Australia's South East Trawl Fishery, which operate throughout its range. It is discarded after capture with an unknown, but probably high, rate of survival. Since this species {{does not appear}} to <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> human activity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The inaccessibility of its habitat affords some {{protection}} for A.bradleyi. Quarrying and strip mining may threaten the sandstone cliffs, {{especially on the}} Cumberland Plateau. Rock climbers and botanical collectors have also damaged populations of the fern. Toxic runoff from atop cliffs can affect them, and they may also <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> both natural and anthropogenic shading of cliffs due to increased tree growth at the cliff base, invasive vines overrunning the cliff face, or the piling of slash against the cliff after logging.|$|E
50|$|This species <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> habitat degradation. It {{requires}} open {{habitat for}} germination, but {{this kind of}} habitat <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> introduced flora. It <b>is</b> also <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> introduced grazing animals.|$|R

5|$|Unlike {{many other}} oceanic islands, Inaccessible Island has {{remained}} free from introduced predators, allowing this species to flourish while many other flightless birds, particularly flightless rails, have gone extinct. The species is nevertheless considered vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), {{due to its}} single small population, which would <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> the accidental introduction of mammalian predators such as rats or cats.|$|E
5|$|After the WTO {{phased out}} {{quantitative}} quotas on textile in 2004 under the Agreement on Textile and Clothing(ATC). Egyptian textile and garment producers feared that their industry would <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> global competition from China and India. The flood of similar articles {{from these two}} nations to the United States could edge out Egyptian exports, and possibly result {{in the loss of}} 150,000 job opportunities. This was estimated to cost some of the $3.2 billion in US foreign direct investment in Egypt. Further, Egypt was in search of sources for increased economic growth and trade to provide jobs for its rapidly growing labor force.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling and sedentary, the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} feeds {{mainly on}} polychaete worms and crustaceans. As in all numbfishes, it {{can produce a}} moderate electric shock to defend itself against predators. This species gives live birth, with the unborn young sustained to term by yolk; the litter size ranges from one to eight. The Tasmanian numbfish is a common bycatch of trawl fisheries. However, its population {{does not appear to}} <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> human activity and it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

Black realizes that the family home holds painful memories and decides to find somewhere else to settle; the post that day contains a deed from his late father, who had left him a cabin in the woods. Later, Blacks meets with Richard Gilbert (Glenn Morshower), {{who is trying to}} convince Black to join his corporate security firm. Black reaffirms his commitment to the Group, however, Gilbert warns that their lives may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> the Group's activities. The next day, Black learns that Gilbert died in a car accident; he believes the vehicle may have been tampered with.|$|E
5|$|Shy and {{difficult}} to approach, the nervous shark is harmless to humans. It is occasionally marketed for food. This species is susceptible to being caught incidentally in coastal gillnets, such as the barramundi (Lates calcarifer) gillnet fishery operating off northern Australia. It may also be caught on line gear and in prawn trawls. The Australian nervous shark population {{does not appear to}} <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> fishing activities, and there the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern. No data on the impact of fishing are available elsewhere in its range, and thus the IUCN has listed it overall under Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a sedentary bird, feeding {{on the forest floor}} and flying only for short distances. Little is known about its behavior due to the paucity of sightings. Searches of Tawi-Tawi in 1971 and 1991 did not discover any evidence of the species' continued existence. Most of the bird's habitat was logged on Tawi-Tawi by 1994. However, an ethnobiological survey in 1995 revealed that the bleeding-heart was common until the 1970s and still survives on small islets near Tawi-Tawi. While another survey in 2009 failed to find the species, there is some hope that it may still persist. For this reason, it is currently listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. Any surviving population would be very small, likely numbering fewer than 50 individuals, and would <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting.|$|E
50|$|Its {{natural habitat}} is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist montane forests. It <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> habitat loss. This species {{is listed as}} Near Threatened because it occupies a small range, in which it <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> hunting and limited habitat loss and degradation.|$|R
50|$|This plant <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> {{habitat loss}} {{in parts of}} its range, even in remote areas.

5|$|The {{original}} specimen {{was shot}} {{along with a}} bird suspected to be its mate from a fruiting tree. Nothing else is known about its behavior. The species has not been definitively reported since its original discovery in 1953, and as several searches of Mount Kanlaon and the surrounding forests have not discovered any sign of the bird, many believe {{that it may be}} extinct. However, a local hunter from southern Negros claimed to have shot it the nineties, and the discovery of many species formerly thought endemic to Negros on the nearby island of Panay have given some hope that the species may persist. As such, it is currently listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Any surviving population would be very small, likely numbering fewer than 50 individuals, and would <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> habitat destruction and hunting.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{habitat of}} Lac Alaotra is {{threatened}} by pollution, destruction of marshes {{for the construction of}} rice fields, overfishing, and introduced species such as exotic fish, plants, the black rat (Rattus rattus), and the small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), another small carnivoran. A bird restricted to the area, the Alaotra grebe (Tachybaptus rufolavatus), was declared extinct in 2010 and the population of the bamboo lemur fell by about 30% from 1994 to 1999. As a narrowly distributed species with a small population, S.durrelli is likely to <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> degradation of its habitat and perhaps competition with the small Indian civet and the black rat, but its conservation status has not yet been formally assessed. The DWCT is working to conserve the Lac Alaotra area and the region has been designated as a protected area.|$|E
5|$|Whales {{can also}} <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> humans more indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by {{commercial}} fisheries as bycatch and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting {{is a significant}} cause of mortality in whales and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include beaked whales. Whales are also affected by marine pollution. High levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they are high in the food chain. They have large reserves of blubber, more so for toothed whales as they are higher up the food chain than baleen whales. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. They can also be poisoned by swallowing litter, such as plastic bags. Environmentalists speculate that advanced naval sonar endangers some whales. Some scientists suggest that sonar may trigger whale beachings, and they point to signs that such whales have experienced decompression sickness.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the depths}} {{at which it}} lives, the goblin shark poses no danger to humans. A few {{specimens}} have been collected alive and brought to public aquariums, though they only survived a short time. One was kept at Tokai University and lived for a week, while another was kept at Tokyo Sea Life Park and lived for two days. Its economic significance is minimal; the meat may be dried and salted, while the jaws fetch high prices from collectors. At one time, the Japanese also used it for liver oil and fertilizer. This shark is not targeted by any fisheries, but is occasionally found as bycatch in bottom gillnets and trawls, hooked on longlines, or entangled in fishing gear. Most captures are isolated incidents; {{one of the few}} areas where it is caught regularly is off southern Japan, where around 30 individuals (mostly juveniles) are taken each year. A black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo) fishery off Madeira also takes two or three goblin sharks annually. In April 2003, over a hundred goblin sharks were caught off northwestern Taiwan; the cause of the event was unknown, though observers noted it was preceded by a major earthquake. The species had never been recorded in the area before, nor has it been found in such numbers since. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the goblin shark under Least Concern. In addition to its wide range, most of its population is thought to reside in unfished environments because few adults are caught. Therefore, it is not believed to <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> human activity.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Władysław still {{tried to}} take {{a leading role in}} European politics, and {{negotiate}} a peaceful settlement to the Thirty Years' War, a settlement which he hoped would ease his way into regaining the Swedish crown. Following the armistice of Stuhmsdorf, Władysław came to increasingly realize that his prospects for regaining the Swedish throne were dim. In the years 1636–1638 he proposed several reforms to strengthen his and his dynasty's power in the Commonwealth. His first plan was an attempt to secure a hereditary province within the country, which would not <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> the possible power shift following a future royal election; this, however, did not gain sufficient support in the Sejm. Next, Władysław attempted to create an order of chivalry, similar to the Order of the Golden Fleece, but this plan was scuttled down as well, with the szlachta and the magnates seeing this as an attempt to create a royal, loyalist elite, and traditionally opposing anything that could lead to the reduction of their extensive power. Popular vote and opposition also resulted in the failure of the plan to raise taxes from trade tariffs; here it was not only the nobility but even the merchants and burghers from towns, like Gdańsk (Danzig) who were able to muster enough support (including from foreign powers) to stop the king's reforms. In fact, the defeat of his plans was so total, that he was forced to make certain conciliatory gestures to the nobility, as the Sejm passed several laws constraining his authority (such as to hire foreign troops), further indicating the limits of royal power in the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|News of the Fort Rosalie attack reached New Orleans {{in early}} December, and the colonists there began to panic. The city {{depended}} upon grain {{and other supplies}} from the Illinois settlement, and shipments {{up and down the}} Mississippi River would <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> the loss of Fort Rosalie. Governor Périer reacted to the massacre by forbidding the entry of a delegation of Choctaw people into the city, for fear that they were using the pretext of a friendly visit to launch an attack. He then ordered slaves and French troops to march downstream and massacre a small village of Chaouacha people who had played no part in the uprising in Natchez. His superiors in Paris reprimanded the leader for this act, which may have been intended to prevent any alliance between slaves and Native Americans against the French colonists. Many Louisiana colonists—Dumont de Montigny in particular—blamed Chépart (who was killed by the Natchez) and Périer for the massacre; Louis XV, the French king, ordered Périer back to France in 1732. Périer's replacement was his predecessor, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, whom the French state thought to be more experienced at dealing with the Native Americans of the region. A year earlier, the French West India Company had given up control of the colony to Louis XV because it had been costly and difficult to manage even before the rebellion.|$|E

5|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart is {{considered}} to be critically endangered by the IUCN. The Sulu bleeding-heart has always been considered a rare bird, and only two specimens, both males, have ever been taken of the species. The specimens, collected in October 1891 on the small islet of Tataan, are the last time anyone has definitely seen the Sulu bleeding-heart alive. The bleeding-heart was searched for 22 days in December 1971 and briefly in September 1991 without success. Most of Tawi-Tawi's forests were cleared by August 1994, and the Sulu bleeding-heart may well be extirpated on the mainland. However, an ethnobiological survey in 1995 generated reports that the bleeding-heart survives and is regularly seen on the nearby islets of Tandubatu, Dundangan, and Baliungan. It was also reported that the species was quite common until the 1970s. Despite this, an expedition in 2009 failed to find any signs of the species or discover a new report of the species' continued existence. The islets it reportedly survives on may also be too small to support a viable population. Any surviving population of Sulu bleeding-hearts is likely to be small, possibly numbering fewer than 50 birds, and would <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> continued habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting. As the Mindanao and Luzon bleeding-hearts are popular cagebirds, any bleeding-heart found on Tawi-Tawi could also be an escaped bleeding-heart instead of the indigenous Sulu bleeding-heart. There are no protected areas in the Sulu Archipelago, and other than two environmental education initiatives in the 1990s nothing has been done to protect any surviving population.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the summer {{roosting}} locations of this species, as well as where maternal colonies are formed, which makes a proper species distribution estimate difficult to obtain. The first study into the summer roosting habits was only done in 2011 so information is scarce. This study performed by Johnson, Kiser and Peterson discovered that these bats most commonly use ground level rock roosts in talus slopes, rock fields and vertical cliff faces for their summer roosts. On average they change their roosts every 1.1 days, males travel about 41 meters between consecutive roosts and females around 67 meters. They also found that females roosting sites were closer to ephemeral water sources than male’s roosts. Females who have young require roost sites that receive a lot of sunlight in order to keep the pups warm while the mother is away from the nesting site. Summer roosting habitats are very difficult to find, and may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> mining, quarrying, oil and gas drilling and other mineral extraction, as well as logging, sprawl highway construction, wind energy and other forms of agricultural, industrial and residential development. However, it is also likely that some of the above disturbances could also create roosting sites for the species.|$|E
5|$|The gharial has {{undergone}} a chronic long-term decline, combined with a rapid short-term decline, leading the IUCN to list the species as critically endangered. In 1946, the gharial population had been widespread, numbering around 5,000 to 10,000; by 2006, however, it had declined 96–98%, reduced to {{a small number of}} widely spaced subpopulations of fewer than 235 individuals. This long-term decline had a number of causes, including egg collection and hunting, such as for indigenous medicine. The rapid decline of about 58% between 1997 and 2006 was caused by increasing use of gill nets and the loss of riverine habitat. The gharial population continues to <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> environmental hazards such as heavy metals and protozoan parasites, but as of 2013 numbers are rising, due to the protection of nests against egg predators. The Chinese alligator was historically widespread throughout the eastern Yangtze River system but is currently restricted to some areas in southeastern Anhui province thanks to habitat fragmentation and degradation. The wild population is believed to exist only in small fragmented ponds. In 1972, the species was declared a Class I endangered species by the Chinese government and received the maximum amount of legal protection. Since 1979, captive breeding programs were established in China and North America, creating a healthy captive population. In 2008, alligators bred in the Bronx Zoo were successfully reintroduced to Chongming Island. The Philippine crocodile is perhaps the most threatened crocodilian and is considered by the IUCN to be critically endangered. Hunting and destructive fishing habits have reduced its population to around 100 individuals by 2009. In the same year, 50 captive bred crocodiles were released into the wild to help boost the population. Support from local people is crucial for the species survival.|$|E
