5|$|Integration {{failure is}} rare, {{particularly}} if a dentist's or oral surgeon's instructions are {{followed closely by}} the patient. Immediate loading implants may have {{a higher rate of}} failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance for this type of procedure. More often, osseointegration failure occurs when a patient is either too unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including smoking or drug use.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are unusual {{since they}} have great {{variability}} in their social structure, yet generally lack sexual dimorphism in size and canine tooth morphology. However, some species tend towards having larger females, and two species of true lemur (genus Eulemur), the gray-headed lemur (E. albocollaris) and the red lemur (E. rufus), exhibit size differences in canine teeth. True lemurs show sexual dichromatism (sexual differences in fur coloration), <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between the genders varies from strikingly obvious, as in the blue-eyed black lemur (E. macaco), to nearly imperceptible {{in the case of}} the common brown lemur (E. fulvus).|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Bavaria legally {{defined the}} apothecaries' pound as 360.00g (an ounce of 30.00g). In 1815, Nuremberg lost {{its status as}} a free city and became part of Bavaria. From now on the Nuremberg apothecaries' pound was no longer the {{official}} apothecaries' pound in Nuremberg; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> was only 0.6%. In 1836 the Greek apothecaries' pound was officially defined by this standard, four years after Otto, the son of the king of Bavaria, became the first king of Greece. But only few German states followed the example of Bavaria, and with a long delay. The apothecaries' pound of 360g was also adopted in Lübeck, where it was official as of 1861.|$|E

5|$|The USEE had a scare against Eighteen of Bolton in {{the three-day}} match {{starting}} on Thursday, 18 July. They won by just 21 runs having been slightly behind on first innings.

The USEE won the final match of this tour, starting on Monday, 22 July, against Twenty-two of Birmingham by 5 wickets, having been 23 behind on first innings. The USEE had a strong Gloucestershire flavour in this match with all three Grace brothers, Midwinter, Gilbert and Cranston involved. Birmingham scored 128 and 119, Grace taking 21 wickets. USEE scored 105 and 144–5, Grace making 7 and 59. He needed the support of his brother E. M., who scored 52 not out, to secure the five wicket victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} is that {{units of the}} comitatenses {{were believed to be}} higher quality than of the limitanei. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> should not be exaggerated. Suggestions have been made that the limitanei were a part-time militia of local farmers, of poor combat capability. This view is rejected by many modern scholars. The {{evidence is}} that limitanei were full-time professionals. They were charged with combating the incessant small-scale barbarian raids that were the empire's enduring security problem. It is therefore likely that their combat readiness and experience were high. This was demonstrated at the siege of Amida (359) where the besieged frontier legions resisted the Persians with great skill and tenacity. Elton suggests that the lack of mention in the sources of barbarian incursions less than 400-strong implies that such were routinely dealt with by the border forces without the need of assistance from the comitatus. Limitanei regiments often joined the comitatus for specific campaigns, and were sometimes retained by the comitatus long-term with the title of pseudocomitatenses, implying adequate combat capability.|$|E
5|$|Viewed {{from the}} top, the parietal {{increases}} in width at the back; {{the increase is}} small in K. langenbergensis, such that the bone is overall rectangular, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> is larger in K. guimarotae. The back of the bone bears a small notch in K. langenbergensis and a general concavity in K. guimarotae that slightly exposes the underlying supraoccipital. The postorbital bears two branches that join with a gentle curve, separated by an angle of 130° in K. langenbergensis. The supratemporal fenestra is roughly square in K. guimarotae but has a thinner back end in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the maximum distance between the supratemporal fenestrae is {{about a third of}} the total width of the top of the skull. The trapezoidal infratemporal fenestra is 1.5 times as long as it is wide in K. langenbergensis.|$|E

25|$|Many reef {{fish are}} toxic. Toxic fish are fish which contain strong toxins in their bodies. There is a {{distinction}} between poisonous fish and venomous fish. Both types of fish contain strong toxins, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> is {{in the way the}} toxin is delivered. Venomous fish deliver their toxins (called venom) by biting, stinging, or stabbing, causing an envenomation. Venomous fish don't necessarily cause poisoning if they are eaten, since the venom is often destroyed in the digestive system. By contrast, poisonous fish contain strong toxins which are not destroyed by the digestive system. This makes them poisonous to eat.|$|E
25|$|Vinyl acetate {{polymers}} include polyvinyl acetate, {{polyvinyl alcohol}} and polyvinyl acetal; {{all come from}} reaction products of vinyl acetate.

Additionally, polyvinyl acetate mixtures tend to degrade in storage and release acetic acid, which in some cases can corrode lead. This compound's coloring ranges from clear/white to a soft yellow. As it ages, it will change to a deeper yellow. It can have a similar appearance to rubber adhesives <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> is that PVA turns white when comes into contact with water.

25|$|Bank Hall, {{built in}} the Jacobean style in 1608, is a brick built mansion of three storeys with Dutch gables and a square central tower on the south front. Some of the {{original}} brickwork in a diaper (lozenge) flushwork pattern is visible on one gable. The house was restored and enlarged by architect George Webster in 1832–3. He added a wing to the west elevations, built a porch on the north side, remodelled the 1608 north elevation windows, covered the roofs with blue Cumbrian slates and finished the walls with stone details. Webster carried out the alterations sympathetically, in a style corresponding to the 17th-century building, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> is marked by the colour of the brickwork and sharpness of the detail. Most windows were renewed during the restoration and two Italian style bay windows added to the south front, altering its appearance.|$|E
