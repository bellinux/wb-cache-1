Initially, the majority of the women insurgents were in the less-organized local militias, but later decided to join the actual EZLN. The women who joined as insurgents had to renounce having a family of their own, because it was too difficult to care for children in the conditions they lived in. There was family planning for women insurgents, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> who did get pregnant, they either went home or left the child with their parents. In the insurgent camps men and women share cooking and cleaning tasks equally.|$|E

25|$|National LEB figures {{reported}} by statistical national agencies {{and international organizations}} are indeed estimates of period LEB. In the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, LEB was 26 years; the 2010 world LEB was 67.2 years. For recent years, in Swaziland LEB is about 49, and in Japan, it is about 83. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, particularly before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers LEB. <b>But</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> who survive early hazards, a life expectancy of 60 or 70 would not be uncommon. For example, a society with a LEB of 40 may have few people dying at precisely 40: most will die before 30 or after 55. In populations with high infant mortality rates, LEB is highly sensitive to the rate {{of death in the}} first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity to infant mortality, LEB can be subjected to gross misinterpretation, leading one to believe that a population with a low LEB will necessarily have a small proportion of older people. For example, in a hypothetical stationary population in which half the population dies before the age of five but everybody else dies at exactly 70 years old, LEB will be about 36, but about 25% of the population will be between the ages of 50 and 70. Another measure, such as life expectancy at age 5 (e5), can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood; in the hypothetical population above, life expectancy at 5 would be another 65. Aggregate population measures, such as the proportion of the population in various age groups, should also be used along individual-based measures like formal life expectancy when analyzing population structure and dynamics.|$|E

500|$|Following {{a hunger}} strike, an IRA {{prisoner}} named Frank Stagg died in Wakefield Prison on 12 February 1976. [...] The case brought international media attention as the British Government denied Stagg's last {{request for a}} military funeral march from Dublin to Ballina, and instead arranged {{for the police to}} bury him secretly. [...] On 1 March 1976, Merlyn Rees, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the Wilson ministry, announced that those people convicted of causing terrorist offences would no longer be entitled to Special Category Status. The policy was not introduced for existing prisoners, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> convicted of offences after 1 March 1976. The end to Special Category Status was a serious threat to the authority which the paramilitary leaderships inside prison had been able to exercise over their own men, as well as being a propaganda blow.|$|E

Matt Smith of Digital Trends said the mouse was comfortable and the buttons felt robust. He noted that the button arrangement may [...] "take some time to get used to". Rob Keyes of GameRant said that when compared to the previous iterations, the Naga 2014 has better buttons and is more user-friendly. He recommended the mouse to people who liked the previous iterations and to people who wish to have better control in MMOs. Marshall Honorof said the mouse is guaranteed to appeal to MMO fans, but isn't very useful for other genres.|$|E
500|$|According to Satoru Iwata, former President of Nintendo, Dragon Quests {{widespread}} {{appeal is}} that it is [...] "made so that anyone can play it...and anyone can enjoy it depending on their different levels and interests." [...] According to him, Dragon Quest is designed for anyone to pick up without needing to read the manual in order to understand it. Ryutaro Ichimura, producer at Square Enix, who has played the game since he was a child, says the Dragon Quest storylines allow players to experience a moving sense of achievement where they take the role of a hero saving the world. Horii believes the ability to appeal to larger audiences of casual gamers, while not alienating the more hardcore gamers, is due to being able to lower the initial hurdle without making it too easy. Iwata and Ichimura believe it is because the games are created in a way that allows both groups to pursue their own goals; casual gamers can enjoy the storyline and battles, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> who want more there is still content for them to pursue.|$|E

Approximately 17,000,000 of the some 45,600,000 two-cent pieces issued had been repurchased by the Treasury as of 1909. Withdrawn pieces were melted and recoined into one-cent pieces. [...] A bill for a two-cent piece bearing {{the portrait of}} recently deceased former president Theodore Roosevelt passed the Senate in 1920 and was strongly recommended by a House committee but never enacted. Numismatist S.W. Freeman noted in 1954 that few alive could remember using a two-cent piece, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> who did, it was often associated with spending it at a candy store.

Full legal tender status was granted the two-cent piece by the Coinage Act of 1965, long after the coin had passed from circulation, as it made all coins and currency of the United States good for all public and private debts without limit. Nevertheless, numismatist Jack White pointed out in a 1971 column that due to its short lifespan, the piece [...] "hardly got its two cents in".|$|E

He gave the film a [...] "Great" [...] 8 out of 10 calling it [...] "A well executed film that defines its genre without resorting to cliches". John Rose from the Fandom Post praised both Yuri and Flynn's characters as [...] "neither character is simply some cardboard cutout incapable of growth or prevented from having another aspect to their personality and it is in these moments where the characters are able to show off their differences and complexities that the two really shine." [...] He also called the film [...] "a fantastically animated feature that may also {{be one of the best}} adaptations of an RPG world that has been created in a different medium". Carly Frith from EGMNow gave it a 9 out of 10 praising its accessibility and the work from the English voice cast.

500|$|Kevin Dunsmore of Hardcore Gamer {{wrote that}} the plot was much more {{grounded}} and realistic than other recent titles in the series and echoed Push Squares review by commenting on the gameplay, writing [...] "You're not a super soldier {{stuck in the middle}} of out-of-this-world set piece, but rather a regular soldier working with a squad to complete objectives." [...] However, he stated that the decision to keep many of the design choices intact from the original was both refreshing and a hindrance; he highlighted examples from the campaign, such as infinitely-spawning enemies, and similarly condemned infamous perks and a lack of killstreak-countering in the multiplayer that had not been removed or fixed, finding it [...] "extremely outdated". Despite this, he complimented the multiplayer as feeling fresh, saying [...] "After years of over-the-top killstreaks, wall-running, and other crazy antics, it's nice {{to get back to the}} basics". He heavily praised the visual enhancements on display, saying [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered is the most extensive visual upgrade any remaster has ever received yet, being more in line with a remake than an actual remaster.

500|$|The {{conflicts}} between Moreno and Saavedra generated international reactions. Lord Strangford {{complained about the}} later actions of the Junta, such as the execution of Liniers, which were seen as more violent than the initial ones. Brazil was also concerned because many copies of the Gazeta were being distributed at Rio Grande do Sul, influencing their slaves with libertarian ideas. The Brazilian government sent Carlos José Guezzi to Buenos Aires, {{with the purpose of}} mediating in the conflict with the royalists at Montevideo and to ratify the aspirations of Carlota Joaquina to rule as regent. He met Saavedra in his first interview, in July, and got a positive impression of him. Saavedra said that if Carlota's rights were confirmed by the Spanish monarchy, Buenos Aires would support her, even if it meant they had to [...] stand against the other provinces. The following month he requested a representative for the Court of Brazil, offered Carlota's mediation with Montevideo, and pointed out that Brazil had forces near the frontier, awaiting orders to attack the revolution. This time, Moreno resisted. Moreno rejected sending a representative, and told him that the Junta did not work for the interests of Brazil, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> of the United Provinces. He rejected the mediation as well, considering that no mediation was possible under a military threat. Guezzi was immediately sent back to Rio de Janeiro on the first available ship.
