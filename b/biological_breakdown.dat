Strains Pseudomonas sp., Nitrincola sp., and Azoarcus sp. very likely yield heterotrophs. Strains Ther-mothrix sp. and Sulfurovum sp. are the autotrophs required for the proposed high-rate EGSB-DSR system. The EGSB-DSR reactor experienced two <b>biological</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> one at loadings of 4. 87, 2. 13, and 1. 82 kg m− 3 day− 1; reactor function was restored by increasing nitrate and acetate loadings. Another breakdown occurred at loadings of up to 8. 00, 4. 08, and 4. 50 kg m− 1 day− 1; the heterotrophic denitrification pathway declined faster than the autotrophic pathway. The mechanism of DSR breakdown is as follows. High sulfide concentration inhibits heterotrophic denitri-fiers, and the system therefore accumulates nitrite. Auto-trophic denitrifiers are then inhibited by the accumulated nitrite, thereby leading to breakdown of the DSR process...|$|R

50|$|On a ship, oil often leaks from {{engine and}} {{machinery}} spaces or from engine maintenance activities and mixes with {{water in the}} bilge, the lowest part of the hull of the ship, {{but there is a}} filter to clean bilge water before being discharged. Oil, gasoline, and by-products from the <b>biological</b> <b>breakdown</b> of petroleum products can harm fish and wildlife and pose threats to human health if ingested. Oil in even minute concentrations can kill fish or have various sub-lethal chronic effects. Bilge water also may contain solid wastes and pollutants containing high levels of oxygen-demanding material, oil and other chemicals. A typically large cruise ship will generate an average of 8 metric tons of oily bilge water for each 24 hours of operation. To maintain ship stability and eliminate potentially hazardous conditions from oil vapors in these areas, the bilge spaces need to be flushed and periodically pumped dry. However, before a bilge can be cleared out and the water discharged, the oil that has been accumulated needs to be extracted from the bilge water, after which the extracted oil can be reused, incinerated, and/or offloaded in port. If a separator, which is normally used to extract the oil, is faulty or is deliberately bypassed, untreated oily bilge water could be discharged directly into the ocean, where it can damage marine life. A number of cruise lines have been charged with environmental violations related to this issue in recent years.|$|E

40|$|NWO [851. 40. 101]The first {{comprehensive}} dataset (492 samples) of dissolved Mn in the Southern Ocean shows {{extremely low}} values of 0. 04 up to 0. 64 nM {{in the surface}} waters and a subsurface maximum with an average concentration of 0. 31 nM (n= 20; S. D. = 0. 08 nM). The low Mn in surface waters correlates well with the nutrients PO 4 and NO 3 and moderately well with Si(OH) (4) and fluorescence. Furthermore, elevated concentrations of Mn in the surface layer coincide with elevated Fe and light transmission and decreased export (Th- 234 /U- 238 deficiency) and fluorescence. It appears that Mn is a factor of importance in partly explaining the HNLC conditions in the Southern Ocean, in conjunction with significant controls by the combination of Fe limitation and light limitation. No input of Mn from the continental margins was observed. This is ascribed to the protruding continental ice sheet that covers the shelf and shuts down the usual <b>biological</b> production, microbial <b>breakdown</b> and sedimentary geochemical cycling. The low concentrations of Mn in the deep ocean basins (0. 07 - 0. 23 nM) were quite uniform, but some elevations were observed. The highest deep concentrations of Mn were observed at the Bouvet Triple Junction region and coincided with high concentrations of Fe and are deemed to be from hydrothermal input. The deep basins {{on both sides of}} the ridge were affected by this input. In the deep Weddell Basin the input of Weddell Sea Bottom Water appears to be the source of the slightly elevated concentrations of Mn in this water layer. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The dinoflagellate Karenia mikimotoi is an HAB, commonly found in the western English Channel and thought {{to be responsible for}} occasional mass finfish and benthic mortalities. We analysed a 19 -year coastal time series of phytoplankton biomass to examine the seasonality and interannual variability of K. mikimotoi in the western English Channel and determine both the primary environmental drivers of these blooms as well as the effects on phytoplankton productivity and oxygen conditions. We observed high variability in timing and magnitude of K. mikimotoi blooms, with abundances reaching > 1000 cells mL� 1 at 10 m depth, inducing up to a 12 -fold increase in the phytoplankton carbon content of the water column. No long-term trends in the timing or magnitude of K. mikimotoi abundance were evident from the data. Key driving factors were identified as persistent summertime rainfall and the resultant input of low-salinity high-nutrient river water. The largest bloom in 2009 was associated with highest annual primary production and led to considerable oxygen depletion at depth, most likely as a result of enhanced <b>biological</b> <b>breakdown</b> of bloom material; however, this oxygen depletion may not affect zooplankton.

In this regard, the complementary use of reversed phase chromatography (RP) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) in the identification of polar TPs, the deep evaluation of the obtained MS/MS spectra, as well as the use of in-house developed quantitative structure-retention relationship (QSRR) retention time prediction models provided valuable support to identification. Fourteen TPs were detected. Thirteen of them were tentatively identified. Four compounds were confirmed (N-desmethylCTR, CTR amide, CTR carboxylic acid and 3 -oxo-CTR) through the purchase of the corresponding reference standard. Probable structures based on diagnostic evidence were proposed for the additional nine TPs. A transformation pathway for the biotransformation of CTR was proposed. The presence of the identified TPs was assessed in real wastewater samples through retrospective analysis resulting in the detection of five compounds. Finally, the potential ecotoxicological risk posed by CTR and its TPs to different trophic levels of aquatic organisms, exposed to the studied effluents, was evaluated by means of risk quotients...|$|E
40|$|Production of xylanases by Penicillium canescens 10 - 10 c is the {{research}} object in Walloon Center of Industrial Biology. Previous works used submerged or liquid fermentation. The actual works are oriented {{more and more}} towards solid fermentation from agricultural or agro-alimentary residues. In addition to the valorization of these residues, solid-state fermentation reaches an increasingly significant interest in various other fields like the <b>biological</b> <b>breakdown</b> of the solid residues, the bioremediation of the organic pollutants in the grounds and {{the reduction of the}} air pollution by the biofiltration. Xylanase is an industrial enzyme used in general in extraction and clarification processes. P. canescens can produce an activity of it, particularly in its balanced forms of xylanases, beta-xylosidase and arabinosidase, and not contaminated by cellulolytic and amylolytic activities. It is a hyper producing strain of xylanase. The production rate is one of the highest in literature (535 U. ml- 1 and 9, 632 U. g- 1 in Erlenmeyer flasks, in submerged and solid state fermentation, respectively). The biobleaching activity of the cellulose pulp by the purified enzyme is higher than a commercial preparation of xylanases from Trichoderma longibrachiatum used industrially. It has a complete hydrolysis degree of 40 % (on glucuronoxylan) and 35 % (on arabinoxylan) at 55 °C and at pH of 5. 9. These characteristics lead to many industrial applications of this enzyme. That is why the optimization of its production by the solid-state fermentation at the laboratory scale in order to define a policy for the industrial transposition later is carried out. This article presents a summary of the scientific literature on this subject. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Oil sludge is a thick viscous {{mixture of}} sediments, water, oil and hydrocarbons, {{encountered}} during crude oil refining, cleaning of oil storage vessels and waste treatment. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are components {{of crude oil}} sludge, constitute serious environmental concerns, {{as many of them}} are cytotoxic, mutagenic and potentially carcinogenic. Improper management and disposal of oil sludge causes environmental pollution. The adverse effects of oil sludge on soil ecology and fertility have been of growing interest among environmental scientist and an important consideration in the development of efficient technologies for remediation of contaminated land, with a view to making such land available for further use. Oil sludge can be treated by several methods such as physical, chemical and biological processes. The biological processes are mostly cost effective and environmentally friendly, as they are easy to design and implement, as such they are more acceptable to the public. Compost, the product of <b>biological</b> <b>breakdown</b> of organic matter is a rich source of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. These microorganisms can degrade the oil sludge to less toxic compounds such as carbon dioxide, water and salts. Compost bioremediation, the application of composting in remediation of contaminated environment, is beginning to gain popularity among remediation scientists. The success or failure of compost bioremediation depends on a number of factors such as nutrients, pH, moisture, aeration and temperature within the compost pile. The bioavailability and biodegradability of the substrate to the degrading microorganisms also contributes {{to the success of the}} bioremediation process. This is a review on the biological remediation technologies employed in the treatment oil sludge. It further assesses the feasibility of using compost technology for the treatment of oil sludge, as a better, faster and more cost effective option.
