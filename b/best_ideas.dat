25|$|A print also {{apparently}} reached Georg August Goldfuss, as in 1831 {{he included}} a similar drawing, clearly influenced by De la Beche's work, {{of a scene}} out of the Jurassic based on fossils from the Jura Mountains in the latest chapter of the serial publication of his Fossils of Germany. Buckland wrote to De la Beche urging him to create more scenes before the Germans used up all the <b>best</b> <b>ideas.</b> De la Beche didn't produce any other scenes on such a scale, but he did include several much smaller and simpler scenes of prehistoric life in the second edition of his Geological Manual (1832). Such scenes didn't remain confined to scientific circles. In 1833 the geologist John Phillips produced a wood cut of an elaborate prehistoric scene, that was obviously influenced by both Duria Antiquior and Goldfuss's Jurassic scene, for publication in the popular Penny Magazine, and another illustration which borrowed elements from Duria Antiquior appeared in a French illustrated dictionary {{of natural history in}} 1834. Such scenes from deep time vividly illustrated advances in palaeontology, and helped convince scholars and even the general public that the deep past could be understood with a reasonable degree of confidence.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after Banks and Rutherford {{decided to}} {{continue}} Genesis in 1996, {{they went to}} The Farm to start writing Calling All Stations. Rutherford initially found the sessions difficult as he saw Collins as [...] "the guy in the middle" [...] who made Banks and himself work better. Their <b>best</b> <b>ideas</b> developed in this period were put forward while they auditioned new singers, including Francis Dunnery and Nick Van Eede. The two main contenders, David Longdon of Big Big Train and Scottish singer Ray Wilson of Stiltskin, auditioned throughout 1996 which involved singing along to Genesis tracks with the lead vocals removed. Wilson was announced as the new Genesis singer in June 1997. Though much of the album was already written {{by the time he}} joined, Banks was pleased with his contributions to the album which included writing the lyrics to [...] "Small Talk" [...] and riffs on [...] "Not About Us" [...] and [...] "There Must Be Some Other Way". Banks and Rutherford opted for two drummers on Calling All Stations – Israeli session musician Nir Zidkyahu and Nick D'Virgilio of Spock's Beard.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the band's three {{previous}} albums, {{most of the}} songs on Spiritual Machines were written solely by Maida. “I think that because this record happened quickly, we just ended up using {{a lot more of}} my songs this time,” stated Maida. “Whatever happens, happens, and if there are good ideas lying around, we use them.” Also unlike on their previous albums, this one was recorded sporadically piece by piece with songs being added as others were discarded. Raine had made several vocal demos at his new home recording studio before the Spiritual Machines idea had come into play. Many of these demos were used for the final recordings and Raine was given production credits. “It was more a means to an end." [...] he explained, [...] "I would start off with a 4-track, then move to an 8-track, then go to digital. I have a ProTools system set up in my basement, so I just try to finish songs and {{get them out of the}} way so I don’t build up this backlog of ideas. We just sift through that stuff, as well as the stuff we do in rehearsal and just pick the <b>best</b> <b>ideas</b> and go. It wasn't like I said I wanted to be a producer or anything, it’s just that the demos I was making came closer to the finished product on one or two occasions, so now, I’m a producer.” ...|$|E
500|$|Weezer {{received}} generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns {{a rating}} out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73 out of 100. AllMusic senior writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{who gave the}} album a [...] rating of {{four and a half}} stars, stated that [...] "this may seem like nothing special -- it's just punk-pop, delivered without much dynamic range but with a whole lot of hooks -- but nobody else does it this [...] so well, no matter how many bands try." [...] PopMatters' writer Jason Thompson also gave the album a positive review, praising the decision of the band to have Ric Ocasek produce them again: [...] "The guitar solos ring out as joyful as the words. And even the songs' lengths are nice and compact. Weezer comes in, plays the song, and exits. No overkill makes for many moments where you want to hear these songs again and again. Perhaps having producer Ric Ocasek back on board was one of the <b>best</b> <b>ideas</b> the band had, as the Green Album is certainly water tight all around." [...] Drowned in Sound gave the album a very positive review, saying [...] "After creating the two greatest pop-rock records in existence it's time to add a third. One listen to the Green Album has you eating out of Rivers Cuomo's hand just like in the past. [...] Rivers Cuomo {{is one of the greatest}} song-writers that has picked up a guitar. Anyone who can with hold the charms of the Geek-rock quartet are obviously made of stone and complete assholes. Sorry to be blunt but it's the way it is. God I think the sun's finally taking its toll." [...] The album would later rank at number 3 in their list of the best albums of 2001, tying with System of a Down's Toxicity and Mogwai's Rock Action. Q listed Weezer as one of the best 50 albums of 2001.|$|E

2500|$|The film project {{originally}} {{belonged to}} Sherry Lansing, {{who bought the}} unpublished manuscript of the novel in 1991, after many publishers had rejected it, and handed it over to producer Scott Rudin when she became CEO of Paramount Pictures in 1992. [...] "It {{was one of the}} single <b>best</b> <b>ideas</b> for a movie I've ever heard," [...] she said in a 1996 interview with The New York Times. [...] "The situation of a woman getting left for a younger version of herself was far too common. But we didn't want a movie about women as victims. We wanted a movie about empowerment." [...] Rudin consulted Robert Harling to write the screenplay, whose script was reworked by Paul Rudnick when Harling left to direct 1996's The Evening Star, the sequel to the 1983 drama Terms of Endearment. Rudnick, however, felt the final script was [...] "incomprehensible": [...] "To figure out the structure of that movie would require an undiscovered Rosetta Stone," [...] he told The New York Times.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project of}} co-writing was {{expedited}} by the {{collaboration between the}} four co-writers on the internet working from different geographical locations. With Iñárritu in Los Angeles, Giacobone and Bo in Buenos Aires, and Dinelaris in New York, the script was mainly written through Skype calls and emails. Although this complicated the writing process, Dinelaris said he believed the <b>best</b> <b>ideas</b> in Birdman came from Skype sessions {{at two in the}} morning where he and Giacobone were [...] "cracking each other up". Incorporating the one-shot feature also affected the writing. Bo said [...] "We wrote everything thinking of this one shot, and a lot of decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting". The one-shot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or re-ordered in post-production, so the writers needed to be [...] "very, very sure about what was on the page." [...] As a result, it took about a year and a half to complete the final draft. As Dinelaris summarized: [...] "You have to be an idiot to do it all in one shot. You have to be an idiot to attempt it. It takes a great, great deal of ignorance to not pay attention to the difficulties and to think you're going to do this. Birdman looks like a good idea now, but [...] we did not know how we would land." ...|$|E
