5|$|Following the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision, Manual became racially {{integrated}} without {{controversy and}} graduated {{its first two}} <b>black</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> 1958. Starting in the 1960s, Manual began to face problems associated with inner city schools in the United States as economically advantaged families moved towards Louisville's suburbs. Manual was exempt from court-ordered busing in the 1970s because its racial makeup already met federal guidelines.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{a lawsuit}} {{challenging}} this segregation {{led to a}} 1983 settlement agreement in which St. Louis County school districts agreed to accept black students from the city on a voluntary basis. State funds were used to transport students to provide an integrated education. The agreement also called for white students from the county to voluntarily attend city magnet schools, {{in an effort to}} desegregate the City's remaining schools. Despite opposition from state and local political leaders, the plan significantly desegregated St. Louis schools; in 1980, 82 percent of <b>black</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> the city attended all-black schools, while in 1995, only 41 percent did so. During the late 1990s, the St. Louis voluntary transfer program was the largest such program in the United States, with more than 14,000 enrolled students.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the first black {{students}} enrolled at the University in 1951, enrollment had grown to nearly 10,000 students—4,000 of whom were women. Prior to 1951, many <b>black</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> Maryland were enrolled at the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore, which was almost shut down in 1947 {{due to lack of}} access, low quality education, and the fear among some black and white leaders that Eastern Shore was allowed to remain a college by the Regents of the University of Maryland solely to keep <b>black</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> segregated, inferior institutions.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{desegregation}} in 1957 in Baltimore, Maryland, the Clifton Park Junior High School had 2,023 {{white students}} and 34 black students; ten years later, it had twelve white students and 2,037 <b>black</b> <b>students.</b> <b>In</b> northwest Baltimore, Garrison Junior High School's student body declined from 2,504 whites and twelve blacks to 297 whites and 1,263 blacks in that period. At the same time, the city's working class population declined {{because of the}} loss of industrial jobs as heavy industry restructured.|$|E
25|$|Although the Lost Year {{had come}} to a close, the black {{students}} who returned to the high schools were not welcomed by the other students. Rather, the black students had a difficult time getting past mobs to enter the school, and, once inside, they were often subject to physical and emotional abuse. The students were back at school and everything would eventually resume normal function, but the Lost Year would be a pretext for new hatred towards the <b>black</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> the public high school.|$|E

25|$|Liberty Hall {{is said to}} have {{admitted}} its first African-American student when John Chavis, a free black, enrolled in 1795. Chavis accomplished much in his life including fighting in the American Revolution, studying at both Liberty Hall and the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), becoming an ordained Presbyterian minister, and opening a school that instructed white and poor <b>black</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> North Carolina. He {{is believed to be the}} first black student to enroll in higher education in the United States, although he did not receive a degree. Washington and Lee enrolled its next African-American student in 1966 in the law school.|$|E
25|$|Segregation in {{education}} has major social repercussions. The prejudice that many young African-Americans experience causes them undue stress {{which has been}} proven to undermine cognitive development. Eric Hanushek and his co-authors have considered racial concentrations in schools, and they find large and important effects. Black students appear to be systematically and physically hurt by larger concentrations of <b>black</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> their school. These effects extend neither to white nor to Hispanic students in the school, implying that they are related to peer interactions and not to school quality. Moreover, {{it appears that the}} effect of black concentrations in schools is largest for high achieving black students.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Supreme Court {{issued its}} {{historic}} Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, 347 U.S. 483, on May 17, 1954. Tied to the 14th Amendment, the decision declared all laws establishing segregated schools to be unconstitutional, and {{it called for}} the desegregation of all schools throughout the nation. After the decision, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) attempted to register <b>black</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> previously all-white schools in cities throughout the South. In Little Rock, {{the capital city of}} Arkansas, the Little Rock School Board agreed to comply with the high court's ruling. Virgil Blossom, the Superintendent of Schools, submitted a plan of gradual integration to the school board on May 24, 1955, which the board unanimously approved. The plan would be implemented during the fall of the 1957 school year, which would begin in September 1957.|$|E

25|$|The area {{takes its}} name from the Parker Gray School, {{originally}} an elementary school which opened in 1920 and which was named to honor Sarah Gray, principal of Hallowell School for Girls and John Parker, principal of Snowden School for Boys, two local segregated schools. The school later became Parker-Gray High School, the first segregated high school for <b>black</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> the city. It was opened in 1950 at the instigation of Charles Hamilton Houston; previously, black students had to travel into the District of Columbia for high school classes. After desegregation the school became Parker-Gray Middle School; it closed in 1979, and was later town down and replaced with a row of townhouses. The site of the school is today home to the headquarters of Alexandria City Public Schools, and is marked with a plaque; a new plaque was unveiled in 2015 to correct errors on the previous one at the site.|$|E
25|$|Amherst's resources, faculty, and {{academic}} life allow the college to enroll {{students with a}} range of talents, interests, and commitments. Students represent 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and fifty-four countries. Ninety-eight percent of students live on campus. Ninety-six percent of Amherst freshmen enrolled in Fall 2015 returned for their sophomore year; ninety-three percent of the most recent cohort graduated within six years. There are more than 140 student groups at Amherst. Students pursue their interests through student-led organizations funded by the student government, including a variety of cultural and religious groups, publications, fine and performing arts and political advocacy and service groups. Groups include a medieval sword-fighting club, a knitting club, and a club devoted to random acts of kindness, among others. Community service groups and opportunities (locally—through the Center for Community Engagement, nationally, and internationally) have been a priority at Amherst and for former President Anthony Marx, who helped start a secondary school for <b>black</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> apartheid South Africa.|$|E
25|$|American {{public school}} systems, {{especially}} in large metropolitan areas, {{to a large}} extent are still de facto segregated. Whether due to Brown, or due to Congressional action, or due to societal change, the percentage of black students attending majority-black school districts decreased somewhat until the early 1980s, at which point that percentage began to increase. By the late 1990s, the percentage of <b>black</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> mostly minority school districts had returned to about what it was in the late 1960s. In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 (2007), the Court held that, if a school system became racially imbalanced due to social factors other than governmental racism, then the state is not as free to integrate schools as if the state had been at fault for the racial imbalance. This is especially evident in the charter school system where parents of students can pick which schools their children attend based on the amenities provided by that school and the needs of the child. It seems that race is a factor in the choice of charter school.|$|E

500|$|In 1914, the {{existing}} school was torn down and two new structures were built. Since schools were segregated at that time, a two-story brick building was constructed on Mimosa Boulevard {{to house the}} white students in grades 1 through 10, and a one-room wooden building was built on Pleasant Hill Avenue for <b>black</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> grades 1 through 7. [...] The Pleasant Hill facility {{also served as a}} meeting place for a local lodge and the Pleasant Hill Baptist Church until the church built its own facility across the street in 1922.

Often there were few, or no other <b>black</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> her high school class. Shakur later wrote teachers seemed surprised when she answered a question in class, as if not expecting black people to be intelligent and engaged, and what she was taught a sugar-coated version of history that ignored the oppression suffered by people of color, especially in the United States. In her autobiography she later wrote: “I didn’t know what a fool they had made out of me until I grew up and started to read real history”.|$|E
500|$|Just {{as he had}} as {{baseball}} commissioner, Chandler faced the issue of racial integration during his second term as governor. Among his first actions upon his election was to issue an executive order ensuring that blacks and whites would have equal access to the state park system. He publicly acknowledged the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education as {{the law of the}} land and promised to enforce it. The Kentucky Court of Appeals struck down Kentucky's Day Law—the law proscribing integration—the following year. Some areas of the state resisted the change. Notably, in 1956, when nine <b>black</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> Sturgis, Kentucky attempted to enter previously all-white Sturgis High School, they were blocked by 500 opponents of integration. On September 4, 1956, Chandler called out the National Guard—including a force of over 900 guardsmen and several M47 Patton tanks—to disperse the crowd. The confrontation lasted a total of 18 days before the protesters peacefully dispersed. Shortly thereafter, Chandler took similar actions in response to a protest in the town of Clay, which was also resolved without violence. Of his actions, Chandler remarked [...] "We regret it is necessary to use this means of guaranteeing equal rights to our citizens, but that we must do." ...|$|E
