Presenting his views as a transcript of a fictional encounter with Obama, he was characterized by the press as believing the 9/11 Commission was a whitewash and that the administration of former President George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>may</b> have been responsible for the attacks.|$|E
25|$|Wood was on {{the staff}} of Lieutenant-General Thesiger (who later became Lord Chelmsford), who was then in command of a column in Natal in the Xhosa Wars (also known as the Cape Frontier Wars). He was {{employed}} as a field officer of the 90th Light Infantry, which had arrived in South Africa in January 1878, in the last battle of the wars at Tutu <b>Bush</b> (<b>May</b> 1878). On 13 November he was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel, and on the same day he was appointed commanding officer of the 90th Light.|$|E
25|$|Aphids {{may also}} be {{controlled}} by the release of natural enemies, in particular lady beetles and parasitic wasps. However, since adult lady beetles tend to fly away within 48 hours after release, without laying eggs, repeated application {{of large numbers of}} lady beetles are needed to be effective. For example, one large, heavily infested rose <b>bush</b> <b>may</b> take two applications of 1500 beetles each. In reality, therefore, the only cost effective situation in which mass release of natural enemies makes sense is in closed or semi-closed environments such as glasshouses or polytunnels.|$|E
50|$|In {{larger and}} more modern engines, a rubber bushing transmits the torque of the drive shaft to the propeller's hub. Under a {{damaging}} load the friction of the bushing in the hub is overcome and the rotating propeller slips on the shaft, preventing overloading of the engine's components. After such an event the rubber <b>bushing</b> <b>may</b> be damaged. If so, it may continue to transmit reduced power at low revolutions, but may provide no power, due to reduced friction, at high revolutions. Also, the rubber <b>bushing</b> <b>may</b> perish over time leading to its failure under loads below its designed failure load.|$|R

It was decided to form a team of parachute jumpers that could be dropped in on the crash sites to stabilize the injured pilots and start moving them out of the <b>bush.</b> <b>May</b> was involved in this effort.|$|E
2500|$|Kudlow firmly {{denied that}} the United States would enter a {{recession}} in 2007, or {{that it was in}} the midst of a recession in early to mid-2008. In December 2007, he wrote: [...] "The recession debate is over. It's not gonna happen. Time to move on. At a bare minimum, we are looking at Goldilocks 2.0. (And that's a minimum). The Bush boom is alive and well. It's finishing up its sixth splendid year with many more years to come". In May 2008 he wrote: [...] "President George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>may</b> turn out to be the top economic forecaster in the country" [...] in his [...] "'R' is for 'Right'". He said that [...] "I don't believe we're heading into a recession" [...] in regards to the large Wall Street drop of August 4, 2011 and recent signs of weaknesses in the United States' GDP.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>May</b> <b>Bush</b> {{was popular}} {{in parts of}} Ireland until the late 19th century. This was a small tree or branch—typically hawthorn, rowan or sycamore—decorated with bright flowers, ribbons, painted shells, and so forth. There were {{household}} <b>May</b> <b>Bushes</b> (which would be placed outside each house) and communal <b>May</b> <b>Bushes</b> (which would be set in a public spot or paraded around the neighbourhood). In Dublin and Belfast, <b>May</b> <b>Bushes</b> were brought into town from the countryside and decorated by the whole neighbourhood. Each neighbourhood vied for the most handsome tree and, sometimes, residents of one would try to steal the <b>May</b> <b>Bush</b> of another. This led to the <b>May</b> <b>Bush</b> being outlawed in Victorian times. In some places, it was customary to dance around the <b>May</b> <b>Bush,</b> {{and at the end}} of the festivities it may be burnt in the bonfire. Some, however, were left in place for a month. Thorn trees were seen as special trees and were associated with the aos sí. The custom of decorating a <b>May</b> <b>Bush</b> or <b>May</b> Tree was found in many parts of Europe. Frazer believes that such customs are a relic of tree worship and writes: [...] "The intention of these customs is to bring home to the village, and to each house, the blessings which the tree-spirit has in its power to bestow." [...] Emyr Estyn Evans suggests that the <b>May</b> <b>Bush</b> custom <b>may</b> have come to Ireland from England, because it seemed to be found in areas with strong English influence and because the Irish saw it as unlucky to damage certain thorn trees. However, [...] "lucky" [...] and [...] "unlucky" [...] trees varied by region, and it has been suggested that Beltane was the only time when cutting thorn trees was allowed. The practice of bedecking a <b>May</b> <b>Bush</b> with flowers, ribbons, garlands and bright shells is found among the Gaelic diaspora, most notably in Newfoundland, and in some Easter traditions on the East Coast of the United States.|$|R

2500|$|Prior to April 1972, Bush had {{fulfilled}} {{more than}} the required hours of service, but with {{more than two years}} remaining before his discharge. [...] He volunteered his services on several projects, including a political campaign. After April 1972, <b>Bush</b> <b>may</b> have failed to meet the attendance requirements established for members of the Air National Guard. In mid-1972, he failed to meet the Air Force requirement for an annual physical examination for pilots, and lost his authorization to be a pilot. According to Bush's pay records, he did not attend any drills between mid-April and the end of October 1972. He drilled in Alabama in October and November 1972, and again in January 1973; what duties he performed are unknown. Bush returned to his home unit in Houston and was paid for his service in April 1973 through July 1973; again, what duties he performed are not documented in any way.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2004, the {{organization}} 9/11 Truth released a statement, signed by nearly 200 people, including many relatives {{of people who}} perished on September 11, 2001, that calls for {{an investigation into the}} attacks. It also asserted that unanswered questions would suggest that people within the administration of President George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>may</b> have deliberately allowed the attacks to happen. Actor Edward Asner, former presidential candidate Ralph Nader, former congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, former assistant secretary of housing Catherine Austin Fitts, author Richard Heinberg, Enver Masud, founder of The Wisdom Fund, professors Richard Falk of the University of California, Mark Crispin Miller of New York University, Douglas Sturm of Bucknell University, Burns H. Weston of the University of Iowa College of Law and others signed the statement.

[...] In the month that followed the attacks, when New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani refused to cash a $10 million check written by Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in light of the Prince's suggestion that the attacks were an indication that the United States [...] "should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stand toward the Palestinian cause," [...] McKinney published an open letter to the Saudi Prince. She expressed her disappointment at Giuliani's action and stated, [...] "Let me say that there are {{a growing number of people}} in the United States who recognize, like you, that U.S. policy in the Middle East needs serious examination...Your Royal Highness, many of us here in the United States have long been concerned about reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that reveal a pattern of excessive, and often indiscriminate, use of lethal force by Israeli security forces in situations where Palestinian demonstrators were unarmed and posed no threat of death or serious injury to the security forces or to others." ...|$|E
