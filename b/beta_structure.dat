5000|$|The precise {{function}} of the protein domain SAND remains to be determined. Nevertheless, it {{is thought to be}} a DNA binding domain despite its <b>beta</b> <b>structure.</b> This function can be inferred by studying the DEAF-1 transcription factor. [...] Here, the conserved positively charged residues in the SAND domains suggest the existence of negatively charged ligands. DNA is a negatively charged molecule due to the phosphate found in its backbone. Henceforth, this suggests that the SAND domain is the DNA-binding region of DEAF-1.|$|E
50|$|Like other PR proteins, {{thaumatin}} {{is predicted}} to have a mainly <b>beta</b> <b>structure,</b> with a high content of beta-turns and little helix. Tobacco cells exposed to gradually increased salt concentrations develop a greatly increased tolerance to salt, due to the expression of osmotin, {{a member of the}} PR protein family. Wheat plants attacked by barley powdery mildew express a PR protein (PWIR2), which results in resistance against that infection. The similarity between this PR protein and other PR proteins to the maize alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor has suggested PR proteins may act as some form of inhibitor.|$|E

50|$|The {{chemical}} formula of molybdenum trichloride is MoCl3. Molybdenum trichloride is synthesized by {{the reduction of}} molybdenum pentachloride with hydrogen. The greatest yield is instead produced by the reduction of pure molybdenum (V) chloride, using anhydrous tin (II) chloride as a reducing agent. This procedure must be performed under a moisture-free and oxygen-free atmosphere of prepurified nitrogen. There are two structures of molybdenum trichloride- alpha (α) and beta (β). The alpha structure {{is similar to that}} of aluminum chloride (AlCl3). In this structure, molybdenum has octahedral coordination geometry and exhibits cubic close packing in its crystalline structure. The <b>beta</b> <b>structure,</b> however, exhibits hexagonal close packing.|$|E
50|$|The {{aggregation}} mechanism of alpha-synuclein is uncertain. There {{is evidence of}} a structured intermediate rich in <b>beta</b> <b>structure</b> that can be the precursor of aggregation and, ultimately, Lewy bodies. A single molecule study in 2008 suggests alpha-synuclein exists as a mix of unstructured, alpha-helix, and beta-sheet-rich conformers in equilibrium. Mutations or buffer conditions known to improve aggregation strongly increase {{the population of the}} beta conformer, thus suggesting this could be a conformation related to pathogenic aggregation. Among the strategies for treating synucleinopathies are compounds that inhibit aggregation of alpha-synuclein. It has been shown that the small molecule cuminaldehyde inhibits fibrillation of alpha-synuclein.The Epstein-Barr virus has been implicated in these disorders.|$|E
50|$|The enzyme {{is present}} in human cytosol in two forms due to {{alternative}} splicing and differs among individuals in the population due to a single polymorphism at protein 119, either valine or isoleucine. The enzyme structure {{is described as a}} “doubly wound alpha/beta/alpha sandwich structure” which is quite consistent in all species analyzed thus far. If there is any difference in the sequences between different organisms it occurs in the regions connecting the three motifs in the sandwich structure, but the sequence of the individual motifs tends to be highly conserved. Researchers have found the active site to be in the loop between the <b>beta</b> <b>structure</b> and the second alpha helix and have determined it to be highly specific for isoaspartyl residues. For example, the residues found at the C-terminus of drosophila PIMT (dPIMT) are rotated 90 degrees so as to allow more space for a substrate to interact with the enzyme. In fact, dPIMT appears to alternate between this unique open conformation and the less open conformation common of PIMT in other organisms. Although possibly unrelated to this, increased levels of dPIMT in drosophila have been correlated with increase life expectancy in these organisms due to their importance in protein repair.|$|E

40|$|The {{conformation}} of the inactivating peptide of the Shaker B K+ channel (ShB peptide) {{and that}} of a noninactivating mutant (ShBL 7 E peptide) have been studied. Under all experimental conditions explored, the mutant peptide remains in a predominantly nonordered conformation. On the contrary, the inactivating ShB peptide has a great tendency to adopt a highly stable <b>beta</b> <b>structure,</b> particularly when challenged "in vitro" by anionic phospholipid vesicles. Because the putative peptide binding elements at the inner mouth of the channel comprise a ring of anionic residues and a hydrophobic pocket, we hypothesize that the conformational restrictions imposed on the ShB peptide by its interaction with the anionic lipid vesicles could partly imitate those imposed by the above ion channel elements. Thus, we propose that adoption of <b>beta</b> <b>structure</b> by the inactivating peptide may also occur during channel inactivation. Moreover, the difficulties encountered by the noninactivating ShBL 7 E peptide mutant to adopt <b>beta</b> <b>structure</b> and the observation that trypsin hydrolysis of the ShB peptide prevent both structure formation and channel inactivation lend further support to the hypothesis that adoption of <b>beta</b> <b>structure</b> by the inactivating peptide in a hydrophobic environment is important in determining channel blockade...|$|E
40|$|We report {{here the}} {{identification}} of the key sites for the <b>beta</b> <b>structure</b> motifs of the islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) analogs by using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Duplex folding structures in human IAPP 8 – 37 (hIAPP 8 – 37) assembly were observed featuring a hairpin structure. The multiplicity in rIAPP assembly structures indicates the polydispersity of the rat IAPP 8 – 37 (rIAPP 8 – 37) beta-like motifs. The bimodal length distribution of <b>beta</b> <b>structure</b> motifs for rIAPP 8 – 37 R 18 H indicates the multiple beta segments linked by turns. The IAPP 8 – 37 analogs share common structure motifs of IAPP 8 – 17 and IAPP 26 – 37 with the most probable key sites at positions around Ser 19 /Ser 20 and Gly 24. These observations reveal the similar amyloid formation tendency in the C and N terminus segments because of the sequence similarity, while the differences in specific amino acids at each key site manifest the effect of sequence variations. The results could be beneficial for studying structural polymorphism of amyloidal peptides with multiple <b>beta</b> <b>structure</b> motifs...|$|E

40|$|A beta bulge is {{a region}} between two {{consecutive}} beta-type hydrogen bonds which includes two residues (positions 1 and 2) on one strand opposite a single residue (position x) {{on the other}} strand. Compared to regular <b>beta</b> <b>structure,</b> a beta bulge puts the usual alternation of side-chain direction out of register {{on one of the}} strands, introduces a slight bend in the beta sheet, and locally accentuates the usual right-handed strand twist. Almost all beta bulges are between antiparallel strands, usually between a narrow rather than a wide pair of hydrogen bonds. Ninety-one examples are listed. The two commonest types are the "classic" beta bulge, with position 1 in approximately alpha-helical conformation, and the "G 1 " beta bulge, with a required glycine at position 1 in approximately left-handed alpha-helical conformation, G 1 bulges almost always occur in combination with a type II tight turn. The functional roles of beta bulges probably include compensating for the effects of a single-residue insertion or deletion within <b>beta</b> <b>structure</b> and providing the strong local twist required for form closed beta barrel structures...|$|E

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{organization of}} HLA antigens {{has been investigated}} by spectroscopic and immunochemical techniques. Measurement of the circular dichroism shows that in papain-solubilized HLA the heavy chain {{as well as the}} previously studied light chain (beta 2 -microglobulin) consists predominantly of beta-pleated sheet structures. When heavy chain is separated from the light chain under denaturing conditions and is allowed to renature, about 50 % of the <b>beta</b> <b>structure</b> is lost, concomitantly with most of the alloantigenic activity. Analysis of the two acid-cleaved fragments of HLA-B 7 heavy chain shows that <b>beta</b> <b>structure</b> is preferentially lost from the COOH-terminal region of the heavy chain. Exposure to denaturants per se does not inevitably result in irreversible loss of antigenic activity. However, recovery of antigenic properties does seem to depend on reassociation of the two chains. The results reported here provide further evidence for (i) the similarity of HLA antigens and immunoglobulins at the three-dimensional level and (ii) two distinct and physiologically important conformations of the HLA heavy chain, depending upon whether it is associated with the light chain...|$|E

40|$|Lipid {{membranes}} manifest {{a diverse}} array of surface forces that can fold and orient an approaching protein. To better understand these forces {{and their ability to}} influence protein function, we have used infrared spectroscopy with isotopic editing to characterize the 37 -residue membrane-active antimicrobial polypeptide cecropin A as it approached, adsorbed onto, and finally penetrated various lipid membranes. Intermediate stages in this process were isolated for study by the use of internal reflection and Langmuir trough techniques. Results indicate that this peptide adopts well-ordered secondary structure while superficially adsorbed to a membrane surface. Its conformation is predominantly alpha-helical, although some <b>beta</b> <b>structure</b> is likely to be present. The longitudinal axis of the helical structure, and the transverse axes of any <b>beta</b> <b>structure,</b> are preferentially oriented parallel to the membrane surface. The peptide expands the membrane against pressure when it penetrates the membrane surface, but its structure and orientation do not change. These observations indicate that interactions between the peptide and deeper hydrophobic regions of the membrane provide energy to perform thermodynamic work, but separate and distinct interactions between the peptide and superficial components of the membrane are responsible for peptide folding. These results have broad implications for our understanding of the mechanism of action and the specificity of these antimicrobial peptides...|$|E

40|$|Secondary {{structure}} {{formation in}} the disordered terminal regions of flagellin were studied by circular dichroic (CD) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction. The terminal regions of flagellin are known to form alpha-helical bundles upon polymerization into flagellar filaments. We found from comparative CD studies of flagellin and its F 40 tryptic fragment that a highly alpha-helical conformation can be induced and stabilized in the terminal regions in 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanol (TFE) containing solutions, which is known to promote intra-molecular hydrogen bonding. Two oligopeptides, N(37 - 61) and C(470 - 494), each corresponding to a portion of terminal regions and predicted {{to have a high}} alpha-helix forming potential, were synthesized and studied. Both peptides were disordered in an aqueous environment, but they showed a strong tendency to assume alpha-helical structure in solutions containing TFE. On the other hand, peptides were found to form transparent gels at high concentrations (> 15 mg/ml) and all three methods confirmed that the peptides become ordered into a predominantly <b>beta</b> <b>structure</b> upon gel formation. Our results show that large segments of the disordered terminal regions of flagellin can adopt alpha-helical as well as <b>beta</b> <b>structure</b> depending on the environmental conditions. This high degree of conformational adaptability may be reflecting some unique characteristics of the flagellin termini, which are involved in self-assembly and polymorphism of flagellar filament...|$|E
