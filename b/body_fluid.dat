5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> {{found in}} the brain and spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the known}} species are little studied. Some 600 species (a quarter of the total) are known from a single record from a single host. Over 94% of species are {{associated}} with mammalian hosts, and only about 3% of species can {{be considered to be}} specific parasites of birds. The fleas on birds are thought to have originated from mammalian fleas; at least sixteen separate groups of fleas switched to avian hosts during the evolutionary history of the Siphonaptera. Occurrences of fleas on reptiles is accidental, and fleas have been known to feed on the hemolymph (bloodlike <b>body</b> <b>fluid)</b> of ticks.|$|E
5|$|The main {{nitrogenous}} {{waste product}} is ammonia. Starfish have no distinct excretory organs; waste ammonia is removed by diffusion through the tube feet and papulae. The <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> contains phagocytic cells, coelomocytes, {{which are also}} found within the hemal and water vascular systems. These cells engulf waste material, and eventually migrate to {{the tips of the}} papulae, where a portion of body wall is nipped off and ejected into the surrounding water. Some waste may also be excreted by the pyloric glands and voided with the faeces.|$|E

40|$|Ebola spreads {{through direct}} contact with blood or <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> (such as saliva or urine) of an {{infected}} person or by objects contaminated with the blood or <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> of an infected person. Avoid directly touching sick people or items contaminated with blood or <b>body</b> <b>fluids,</b> and use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for protection of yourself and others. PPE equipment should be worn properly throughout your period of potential exposure. During routine cleaning and other activities, follow usual procedures. While you are cleaning areas {{that might have been}} contaminated with <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> that came from someone who might have been infected with Ebola (for example, from a person who was sent to secondary screening), you should wear two pairs of waterproof disposable gloves, long-sleeved waterproof gown, face mask, and eye protection such as face shield (preferred) or goggles. You should also wear close-toed shoes; wear shoe coverings when cleaning <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> from the floor to prevent your shoes from getting contaminated. These protective items are important to protect your skin, eyes, nose, and mouth from contact with <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> and to keep your clothes from becoming contaminated. You should remove and properly dispose of your PPE (see below) immediately after cleaning <b>body</b> <b>fluids.</b> You should then put on new PPE (if needed) to resume work.

Multiple human mRNA and bacterial RNA markers have been identified for each of these <b>body</b> <b>fluids.</b> RNA and DNA can be coextracted from the same portion of a sample and RNA markers for different <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> can be multiplexed in a single PCR, thereby maximizing the number of analyses that can be performed with limited sample material...|$|R
5|$|A {{blood vessel}} leads {{up the middle}} of the body from the stomach to a {{circular}} vessel {{at the base of the}} lophophore, and from there a single blind vessel runs up each tentacle. A pair of blood vessels near the body wall lead downward from the lophophore ring to the stomach and also to blind branches throughout the body. There is no heart, but the major vessels can contract in waves to move the blood. Phoronids do not ventilate their trunks with oxygenated water, but rely on respiration through the lophophore. The blood contains hemoglobin, which is unusual in such small animals and seems to be an adaptation to anoxic and hypoxic environments. The blood of Phoronis architecta carries twice as much oxygen as a human of the same weight. Two metanephridia filter the <b>body</b> <b>fluid,</b> returning any useful products and dumping the remaining soluble wastes through a pair of pores beside the anus.|$|E

25|$|Having oxygen-carrying {{proteins}} inside specialized cells (as {{opposed to}} oxygen carriers being dissolved in <b>body</b> <b>fluid)</b> {{was an important}} step in the evolution of vertebrates as it allows for less viscous blood, higher concentrations of oxygen, and better diffusion of oxygen from the blood to the tissues. The size of red blood cells varies widely among vertebrate species; red blood cell width is on average about 25% larger than capillary diameter, and it has been hypothesized that this improves the oxygen transfer from red blood cells to tissues.|$|E
25|$|Parasitic {{lampreys}} feed on prey {{as adults}} by attaching their mouthparts {{to the target}} animal's body, then using their teeth to cut through surface tissues until they reach blood and <b>body</b> <b>fluid.</b> A study of stomach content of some lampreys have also shown remains of intestines, fins and vertebrae from their prey. Although attacks on humans do occur, they will generally not attack humans unless starved. Non-parasitic lampreys, which are usually freshwater species, do not feed as adults; they live off reserves acquired as ammocoetes (larvae), which they obtain through filter feeding.|$|E
25|$|N. bombycis kills 100% of {{silkworms}} hatched from infected eggs. This {{disease can}} be carried over from worms to moths, then eggs and worms again. This microsporidium comes from the food the silkworms eat. If silkworms get this disease in their worm stage, no visible symptoms occur. However, mother moths pass the disease to the eggs, and 100% of worms hatching from the diseased eggs will die in their worm stage. To prevent this disease, it is extremely important to rule out all eggs from infected moths by checking the moth's <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> under a microscope.|$|E

25|$|Excretion is {{performed}} mainly by two small kidneys. In diapsids, uric acid {{is the main}} nitrogenous waste product; turtles, like mammals, excrete mainly urea. Unlike the kidneys of mammals and birds, reptile kidneys are unable to produce liquid urine more concentrated than their <b>body</b> <b>fluid.</b> This is because they lack a specialized structure called a loop of Henle, which {{is present in the}} nephrons of birds and mammals. Because of this, many reptiles use the colon to aid in the reabsorption of water. Some are also able to take up water stored in the bladder. Excess salts are also excreted by nasal and lingual salt glands in some reptiles.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} {{hyponatremia}} are typically classified by a person's <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> status into low volume, normal volume, or high volume. Low volume hyponatremia can occur from diarrhea, vomiting, diuretics, and sweating. Normal volume hyponatremia {{is divided into}} cases with dilute urine and concentrated urine. Cases in which the urine is dilute include adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and drinking too much water or too much beer. Cases in which the urine is concentrated include syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). High volume hyponatremia can occur from heart failure, liver failure, and kidney failure. Conditions {{that can lead to}} falsely low sodium measurements include high blood protein levels such as in multiple myeloma, high blood fat levels, and high blood sugar.|$|E
25|$|Jumping spiders are {{generally}} diurnal, active hunters. Their well-developed internal hydraulic system extends their limbs by altering {{the pressure of}} <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> (hemolymph) within them. This enables the spiders to jump without having large muscular legs like a grasshopper. Most jumping spiders can jump several times the length of their bodies. When a jumping spider is moving from place to place, and especially just before it jumps, it tethers a filament of silk (or 'dragline') to whatever it is standing on to protect itself if the jump should fail. Should it fall, for example if the prey shakes it off, it climbs back up the silk tether. Some species, such as Portia, will actually let themselves down to attack prey such as a web spider apparently secure {{in the middle of}} its web. Like many other spiders that leave practically continuous silk trails, jumping spiders impregnate the silk line with pheromones that play a role in social and reproductive communication, and possibly in navigation.|$|E
500|$|All animals need to {{keep the}} {{concentration}} of dissolved substances in their <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> at a fairly constant level. Internal parasites and free-living marine animals live in environments with high concentrations of dissolved material, and generally let their tissues have the same level of concentration as the environment, while freshwater animals need to prevent their <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> from becoming too dilute.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the feasibility and interest of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for bacterial genomes in <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> other than blood in patients with acute severe sepsis. METHODS: Twenty-six consecutive patients admitted for severe sepsis or septic shock were prospectively studied. <b>Body</b> <b>fluids</b> were sampled as clinically indicated and tested using standard microbiological methods and modified RT-PCR methods (universal PCR and specific PCRs). Results of standard microbiological tests were compared with those of PCR tests. RESULTS: Direct RT-PCR testing was successfully performed on all nonblood <b>body</b> <b>fluids.</b> Of 29 <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> collected, 23 were positive for at least 1 microorganism with conventional tests. Of 18 microbiological tests positive for a single microorganism, 15 fully agreed with RT-PCR assays, and the remaining 3 samples were infected with bacteria not screened by PCR testing. Among the 5 polymicrobial results obtained with conventional tests, RT-PCR agreed in 4 patients. The RT-PCR tests allowed additional clinically relevant bacterial identification in 3 of 6 samples with negative microbiological culture.
