5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Gerald Ford {{moves into}} the house across the street after Bush leaves. When {{originally}} conceived, Richard Nixon was going to move in instead, though this was changed to <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> following Nixon's death. The writers then decided it would be funnier if it were Ford since they believed he was the politician who best represented Homer. Keeler's first draft also included a musical number in the style of Tom Lehrer's satirical recordings, although this ended up being cut.|$|E
5|$|The first form of {{sanctions}} {{initiated by the}} US against Yugoslavia took place already from 1990 as the Nickels Amendment, which was sponsored by senators Don Nickles and <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole.</b> The amendment was passed due to concerns about Albanians being arrested in Kosovo.

5|$|Ford reluctantly {{agreed to}} run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a {{challenge}} for the Republican party nomination. Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan and the party's conservative wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in South Vietnam, for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal. (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries, including North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and California, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the Republican Convention in Kansas City, Missouri. The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> of Kansas.|$|E
