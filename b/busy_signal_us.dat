5000|$|In {{some parts}} of the United States when a line is busy an {{intercept}} message plays over a <b>busy</b> <b>signal,</b> then when the message finishes only the <b>busy</b> <b>signal</b> continues. This was done ever since automatic ring back was introduced. Or the message would play once and then the <b>busy</b> <b>signal</b> is played after the message. For example, the message would say: The number you have called is busy. If it becomes free in the next 30 minutes you will hear a special ring when a call can be attempted. Please hang up.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We address dynamic {{spectrum}} sharing for fu-ture mobile communication systems where multiple opera-tors share license exempt spectrum. In {{such an environment}} cognitive radios are needed {{that are able to}} sense, as well as dynamically allocate the available resources in a distributed manner and on a short-term basis. In this paper we propose dynamic spectrum assignment (DSA) based on <b>busy</b> burst (BB) <b>signaling.</b> Its basic principle is that receivers upon data reception transmit a <b>busy</b> <b>signal</b> in an adjacent time multiplexed minislot. Through exploitation of channel reciprocity, other potential transmitters are prevented from interfering by first listening to the <b>busy</b> <b>signal.</b> Due to its decentralized nature, the considered BB-DSA protocol appears to be ideally suited for dynamic {{spectrum sharing}} in license exempt spectrum.
