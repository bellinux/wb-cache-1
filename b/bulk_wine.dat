25|$|The grapevine was {{introduced}} to Australia in the 19th century and was mostly a <b>bulk</b> <b>wine</b> producing grape. The particular clones planted in Australia were of poor quality and highly susceptible to coulure, frost and downy mildew. By {{the mid to late}} 20th century, many acres of Malbec were uprooted and planted with different varieties. By 2000, there were slightly over 1,235 acres (500 hectares), with the Clare Valley having the most significant amount. As newer clones become available, plantings of Malbec in Australia have increased slightly.|$|E

While this region was known historically for its large, <b>bulk</b> <b>wine</b> production, in recent years, producers {{have focused on}} premium wine production such as plantings of Sauvignon blanc in the Groenekloof area near Darling and Pinotage in unirrigated farmland of the Swartland. In the Olifants River region, Chenin blanc and Colombard are popular. The area {{is also home to}} South Africa's biggest single co-operative winery – the Vredendal Co-operative.|$|E
25|$|Various {{methods of}} vine {{training}} {{were introduced in}} Argentina by European immigrants in the 19th and 20th century. The espaldera system combined the traditional method of using three wires to train the vines close to the ground. In the 1950s a new system known as parral cuyano was introduced where vines were trained high off {{the ground with the}} clusters allowed to hang down. This style was conducive to the high yielding varieties of Criolla and Cereza that were the backbone of the <b>bulk</b> <b>wine</b> production industry that arose in response to the large domestic market. In the late 20th century, as the market turned to focus more on premium wine production, more producers switched back to the traditional espaldera system and began to practice canopy management in order to control yields.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe biologically active stilbenoids-resveratrol and its glucosides were {{identified}} in the dry <b>bulk</b> <b>wines</b> of different types made with red-grape vintage variety of Saperavi (Vitis vinifera L.) : cis-resveratrol, trans-resveratrol, cis-piceid and trans-piceid. Red and pink wines were made by different technology: I – dry, pink, of a European type; alcoholic fermentation with natural microflora; II – dry, pink, of a European type; alcoholic fermentation with dry yeast “B 2000 ”. III – red, dry; alcoholic fermentation with no-stem pomace and aging on it for 5 months; IV – dry, red, of a Kakhetian type; alcoholic fermentation with stem pomace with natural microflora and aging on it for 5 months; V – dry, red, of a Kakhetian type, with preliminary fermentation of cluster stems, then, alcoholic fermentation with natural microflora and aging on it for 5 months. The impact of the wine-making technology on the variability of the concentrations of these substances is proved. Kakhetian <b>bulk</b> <b>wines</b> (IV and V) also differ from one another.

Between 1995 and 2003, plantings of Malbec in California increased from 1000 acres (404 hectares) to more than 7000 acres (2,830 hectares). While the appearance of Californian varietal Malbec is increasing, the grape is still most widely used for blending. In California, the American Viticultural Areas (AVA) with the most plantings of Malbec include Napa Valley, Alexander Valley, Paso Robles and Sonoma Valley.|$|E
2500|$|Austrian {{wines are}} mostly dry white wines (often {{made from the}} Grüner Veltliner grape), though some sweeter white wines (such as dessert wines made around the Neusiedler See) are also produced. About 30% of the wines are red, made from Blaufränkisch (also known as Lemberger, or as Kékfrankos in {{neighbouring}} Hungary), Pinot noir and locally bred varieties such as Zweigelt. Four thousand years of winemaking history counted for little after the [...] "antifreeze scandal" [...] of 1985, when {{it was revealed that}} some wine brokers had been adulterating their wines with diethylene glycol. The scandal destroyed the market for Austrian wine and compelled Austria to tackle low standards of <b>bulk</b> <b>wine</b> production, and reposition itself as a producer of quality wines. The country is also home to Riedel, makers {{of some of the most}} expensive wine glasses in the world. Some of the best producers of Austria include Weingut F.X.

2500|$|Wine was {{the third}} {{essential}} part of the Parisian diet. [...] The daily alcohol consumption of the Paris working class was high; [...] in times of economic difficulty, the consumption of other food products decreased, but the consumption of wine increased; it was consumed to relieve stress and to forget difficulties. [...] Low-quality and inexpensive wines were made a vineyards just outside the city. [...] The best quality wines were brought by wine merchants from the chateaux of Burgundy and Bordeaux. [...] By far the largest quantity of wine arrived by boat at the Halle aux Vins, which was located on the quai des Bernardins between rue Cuvier and Place Maubert, next to the Jardin des Plantes. The Halle aux Vins had been started in 1808 and finished in 1818; [...] it occupied fourteen hectares, and had 159 wine cellars at street level and another forty-nine caves underground.

The historical heart of South African wine has been the area near the Cape Peninsula and modern-day Cape Town. This area is still of prominence in the industry being home to the major wine regions of Constantia, Stellenbosch and Paarl. Today, wine is grown throughout the Western Cape and in parts of the Northern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape regions.

Over the same period, the area planted with vines rose from 92 hectares (1.4% of the national total) to 1,062 hectares (5.1%). Reflecting this rapid expansion, the long lead-time for planting to come into production, and the focus in Central Otago on quality <b>wines</b> rather than <b>bulk</b> <b>wines,</b> actual wine production accounted for only 0.5% (376 tonnes) of the New Zealand total in 1996, increasing to 0.9% (1,439 tonnes) in 2004.|$|R

2500|$|It wasn't {{till the}} 1950s that {{domestic}} stability helped {{to usher in}} a period of revival for the Spanish wine industry. Several large co-operative wineries were founded during this period and an international market was created for generic <b>bulk</b> <b>wines</b> that were sold under names like Spanish sauternes and Spanish chablis. In the 1960s, Sherry was rediscovered by the international wine market and soon Rioja wine was in demand. The death of Francisco Franco in 1975 and the Spanish transition to democracy allowed more economic freedom for winemakers and created an emerging market with the growing [...] middle class of Spain. The late 1970s and 1980s saw periods of modernization and renewed emphasis on quality wine production. The 1986 acceptance of Spain into the European Union brought economic aid to the rural wine industries of Galicia and La Mancha. The 1990s saw the influence of flying winemakers from abroad and broader acceptance of the use of international grape varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. In 1996, the restrictions on irrigation were lifted which gave winemakers greater control over yields and what areas could be planted. Soon the quality and production volume of premium wines began to overtake the presence of generic Spanish <b>bulk</b> <b>wines</b> on the market and Spain's reputation entering the 21st century was that of a serious wine producing country that could compete with other producers in the world wine market.|$|R
