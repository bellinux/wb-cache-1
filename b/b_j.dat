40|$|A {{revision}} of the Neotropical genus Bonyunia M. R. Schomb. ex Progel (Loganiaceae, Antonieae) is provided, including a key to species, description, distribution, IUCN Red List status, and discussion. Bonyunia is morphologically and ecologically diverse with taxonomically informative characters that include habit, seed and leaf morphology, and the shape and indument of the calyx, bracts, and bracteoles. Bonyunia occurs in lowland regions of the Amazon River watershed (Brazil and Bolivia), the Orinoco River watershed (Colombia and Venezuela), tepuis of the Guayana region and outliers (Brazil, Guyana, Venezuela, and Colombia), and lowland regions of Amazon Basin–facing Andes in Peru, throughout on white sands. Ten species are recognized, including four established species: B. antoniifolia Progel, B. aquatica Ducke, B. minor N. E. Br. (including B. cinchonoides Gleason & Standl.), and B. superba M. R. Schomb. ex Progel. Six species are newly described: <b>B.</b> excelsa <b>J.</b> R. Grant (Colombia), <b>B.</b> magnifica <b>J.</b> R. Grant (Brazil), <b>B.</b> nobilis <b>J.</b> R. Grant (Colombia), <b>B.</b> pulchra Ricketson, <b>J.</b> R. Grant & Liesner (Peru), <b>B.</b> spectabilis <b>J.</b> R. Grant (Guyana), and <b>B.</b> venusta <b>J.</b> R. Grant (Brazil) ...|$|R

5|$|As General Manager, Isiah Thomas quickly staffed the {{management}} positions {{with his own}} personnel, naming long-time Detroit Pistons assistant Brendan Malone as the Raptors' head coach.

Following a coin flip, Toronto was given first choice and selected Chicago Bulls point guard and three-point specialist <b>B.</b> <b>J.</b> Armstrong. Armstrong refused to report for training, and Thomas promptly traded him to the Golden State Warriors for power forwards Carlos Rogers and Victor Alexander.
