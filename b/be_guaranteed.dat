5|$|Despite German {{interest}} in the battlecruiser project, the two sides could not agree on terms. The German delegation insisted that orders placed in their country <b>be</b> <b>guaranteed,</b> with financial compensation {{to be paid to}} German companies if the Dutch did not construct the ships. They also refused to release a complete set of plans for the Scharnhorsts. Further complicating negotiations, the Dutch Cabinet, which would have to approve any deal, did not convene during the summer of 1939.|$|E
5|$|For random initial conditions, the {{boundaries}} between the trees formed in this way themselves shift in a seemingly random pattern, and trees frequently die out altogether. But {{by means of the}} theory of shift registers he and others were able to find initial conditions in which the trees all remain alive forever, the pattern of growth repeats periodically, and all of the clearings can <b>be</b> <b>guaranteed</b> to remain bounded in size.|$|E

The Hong Kong Basic Law, based on English law, would serve as the constitutional document after the transfer. It was ratified in 1990. The expiry of the 1898 lease on the New Territories in 1997 created problems for business contracts, property leases and confidence among foreign investors.|$|E
5|$|Keeping the old {{systems and}} {{converting}} them to encrypted systems was also considered. This {{was estimated to}} cost NOK500 million to install, but could not <b>be</b> <b>guaranteed</b> to work satisfactorily. In particular, encryption would delay communications, {{which would be a}} problem for urgent communications. It was also uncertain whether the level of encryption would be sufficient to allow the network to be considered closed and allow personal information to be transmitted.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII {{was forced}} {{once again to}} leave Jelgava when Alexander of Russia {{informed}} him that his safety could not <b>be</b> <b>guaranteed</b> on continental Europe. In July 1807, Louis boarded a Swedish frigate to Stockholm, bringing with him only the Duke of Angoulême. Louis did not stay in Sweden for long; he arrived in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, England, in November 1807. He took up residence in Gosfield Hall, leased {{to him by the}} Marquess of Buckingham.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the ticket}} {{reselling}} {{that occurred during the}} week after the Super Bowl, and in order to limit that kind of profiteering, Hawaii Senate President Donna Mercado Kim introduced Senate Resolution 12, also known as the Bruno Mars Act. It limits all ticket purchases within 48 hours of the on-sale date to the physical box office. This ensures that anyone who comes to the box office to buy tickets for a show should almost certainly <b>be</b> <b>guaranteed</b> a ticket and discourages ticket scalping. The State Senate in Hawaii passed the law.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's {{third and}} final exile was of even shorter duration, and after two months he was reunited with Edward in England. Archbishop Winchelsey responded by excommunicating Gaveston, as the Ordinances had stipulated. Lancaster, who had by this time {{inherited}} his father-in-law Lincoln, had taken over leadership of the baronial opposition. A number of the barons set out in pursuit of Gaveston while the king left for York. Gaveston ensconced himself at Scarborough Castle, and on 19 May 1312 agreed on a surrender to Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, {{as long as his}} security would <b>be</b> <b>guaranteed.</b>|$|E
5|$|GoldenEye was edited to <b>be</b> <b>guaranteed</b> a PG-13 {{rating from}} the MPAA and a 12 rating from the BBFC. The cuts {{included}} the visible bullet impact to Trevelyan's head {{when he is}} shot in the prologue, several additional deaths during the sequence in which Onatopp guns down the workers at the Severnaya station, more explicit footage and violent behaviour in the Admiral's death, extra footage of Onatopp's death, and Bond giving her a rabbit punch in the car. In 2006, the film was re-mastered and re-edited for the James Bond Ultimate Edition DVD in which the BBFC cuts were restored, causing the rating to be changed to 15. However, the original MPAA edits still remain.|$|E

He was also perturbed {{by an increase in}} religious enthusiasm on campus and a temperance movement, which he mildly protested. Tucker zealously defended higher salaries for more tenured professors, and he was enraged when the University reduced his annual salary from $1500 to $1000. Having produced documentation proving that Jefferson had intended his salary <b>be</b> <b>guaranteed</b> for life, he convinced the university to reinstate his original salary.|$|E
5|$|In Smith's view, the {{opportunity}} to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity; those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf. Smith said that children who died in their innocence would <b>be</b> <b>guaranteed</b> to rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation. Apart from those who committed the eternal sin, Smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not clear}} how the fight started, with reports of it either being started by Leeds fans {{throwing}} beer glasses and insulting the Turkish flag, or being started by Galatasaray fans throwing chairs. Police arrested Ali Umit Demir and three other men for the stabbings. Demir was later found guilty of murder {{and was sentenced to}} 15 years imprisonment. As a result of the stabbings, Leeds United banned Galatasaray fans from attending the second leg at Elland Road, claiming that the safety of fans could not <b>be</b> <b>guaranteed.</b> The ban was supported by UEFA and only 80 tickets were issued to Galatasaray for officials and representatives of the Turkish government.|$|E
5|$|Known {{methods for}} {{repeatedly}} finding the closest pair of clusters in a dynamic set of clusters either require superlinear space {{to maintain a}} data structure that can find closest pairs quickly, or they take greater than linear time to find each closest pair. The nearest-neighbor chain algorithm uses a smaller {{amount of time and}} space than the greedy algorithm by merging pairs of clusters in a different order. In this way, it avoids the problem of repeatedly finding closest pairs. Nevertheless, for many types of clustering problem, it can <b>be</b> <b>guaranteed</b> {{to come up with the}} same hierarchical clustering as the greedy algorithm despite the different merge order.|$|E

5|$|The last Ottoman census, {{conducted}} in 1908, counted 128,000 Orthodox Christians and 95,000 Muslims in the region.

The {{rest of the}} Orthodox community spoke an Albanian patois at home, but was literate only in Greek, which was used in cultural, trading and economic activities. Moreover, they expressed a strong pro-Greek feeling, and {{were the first to}} support the following breakaway autonomist movement.
