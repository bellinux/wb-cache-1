25|$|The squared-off {{shape of}} the Belpaire firebox does not fit easily beneath a saddle tank, and so most saddle tanks {{retained}} the older round-topped boiler instead. A few American locomotives used saddle tanks that only covered the <b>boiler</b> <b>barrel,</b> forward of the firebox.|$|E
25|$|Holden {{continued}} for thirteen years to fit his engines with stovepipe chimneys, {{and also with}} Thomas Worsdell's capacious cab, with its gracefully curved side-sheets. Although for a time he continued with the Worsdell three-ring <b>boiler</b> <b>barrel,</b> with the dome on the middle ring, before long he designed a two-ring boiler with the dome on the front ring, immediately behind the chimney. He substituted Stephenson link-motion for the Joy valve gear preferred by Worsdell.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} side tanks was often limited {{in order to}} give access to the inside motion. If it was desired to extend them {{to the front of the}} {{locomotive}} for greater capacity, access could be facilitated by apertures provided at the appropriate location. With larger side tanks it was sometimes necessary to taper the tanks slightly at the front end to improve forward visibility. Side tanks almost all stopped at, or before, the end of the <b>boiler</b> <b>barrel,</b> with the smokebox protruding ahead. A few designs did reach to the front of the smokebox and these were termed 'flatirons'.|$|E
50|$|The engines from Beyer, Peacock were war-time {{austerity}} {{models on}} which planished steel boiler lagging {{was replaced by}} ordinary steel lagging, while cosmetic dressing items like stainless steel lagging bands, chrome-plated handrails and rounded corners {{on the front of}} the firebox lagging were absent or replaced by unplated items. While the <b>boiler</b> <b>barrels</b> of the pre-war engines were of nickel steel, the austerity locomotives had <b>boiler</b> <b>barrels</b> made of carbon steel with steel plates of 1/16 in greater thickness. When it was subsequently found that the increased thickness was unnecessary, 13/16 in thick carbon steel plates were used on later orders, the same thickness as earlier used with nickel steel plates, which resulted in a desirable reduction in axle loads.|$|R
50|$|In 1879, four 4-4-0 American type tender {{passenger}} locomotives {{were delivered}} to the CGR from Avonside Engine Company for fast passenger service out of Cape Town and East London respectively. They were equipped with 48 in coupled wheels and six-wheeled tenders, numbered W25 and W26 for the Western System and E8 and E9 for the Eastern System. Their slide valves were actuated by Stephenson Link motion, while their <b>boiler</b> <b>barrels</b> were constructed in three sections, arranged telescopically.|$|R
50|$|The Double Fairlie was {{the first}} {{articulated}} locomotive to enter service in South Africa and also the first to have Walschaerts valve gear, which had been invented in 1844 by Belgian locomotive foreman Egide Walschaerts. The locomotive which was acquired by the CGR was of the separate boiler type. It had two <b>boiler</b> <b>barrels,</b> with a central firebox common to both barrels and fired from the side. The buffing and drawgear were fitted on the two engine units. The pivots were located under the two boiler saddles and were carried on centre bearings which formed part of the engine unit frames.|$|R
25|$|Ten {{locomotives}} (numbers 92020-92029) {{were built}} in 1955 with the Franco-Crosti boiler. which incorporated a combustion gas feed water preheater that recuperated low-grade residual heat In the 9F version, this {{took the form of}} a single cylindrical water drum running along the underside of the main <b>boiler</b> <b>barrel.</b> The standard chimney on top of the smokebox was only used during lighting up. In normal working the gases went through firetubes inside the preheater drum that led to a second smokebox situated beneath the boiler from which there emerged a chimney on the right-hand side, just forward of the firebox. In the event, the experiment did not deliver the hoped-for benefits, and efficiency was not increased sufficiently to justify the cost and complexity. Moreover, conditions were unpleasant on the footplate in a cross-wind, this in spite of the later provision of a small deflector plate forward of the chimney. These problems led to the subsequent removal of the preheater drum, although the locomotives did retain the original main smokebox with its distinctive look.|$|E

500|$|The 224 Class were {{followed}} in 1873 {{by the four}} locomotives of Wheatley's 420 Class, nos. 420–3. These differed from the 224 Class in several respects: the bogie wheels were [...] diameter instead of the coupled wheelbase was [...] instead of the dome was mounted on the <b>boiler</b> <b>barrel</b> instead of the firebox; and the rear wheel splashers were shaped to the wheel instead of being square-topped. They were intended for use on the Waverley route, over which an increase of traffic was anticipated: the Midland Railway (MR) were at the time building their Settle–Carlisle line. This route not yet being open, and the English traffic being entirely {{in the hands of}} the London and North Western Railway who worked closely in tandem with the Caledonian Railway, the NBR's main rival, the trains over the Waverley route were comparatively light and well within the capabilities of the 420 Class.|$|E
50|$|From the 1840s, <b>boiler</b> <b>barrels</b> were {{constructed}} from hoops of rolled iron, or later steel, sheet. As boilers were {{longer than the}} width of the available iron sheet, two or three hoops were required. For strength, the dome was always placed in the centre of a hoop, rather than spanning a joint. Early boilers used narrow plates and thus had a centrally located dome, in the centre of the middle hoop. Later boilers could use the wider plates then available and used two hoops, so as {{to reduce the number of}} riveted joints. These domes were thus placed at a quarter of the barrel's length (from the front of the firebox wrapper).|$|R
50|$|Although they {{appeared}} to have exceedingly long <b>boilers,</b> the <b>barrel</b> {{in front of the}} rear set of cylinders actually contained first a primitive firetube superheater for further heating the steam before use; the steam was carried forward from the boiler proper by outside steam pipes as shown in the photograph. Also in this space was a reheater for the high-pressure exhaust before it was fed to the forward low-pressure cylinders.|$|R
50|$|Drummond's T7 and E10 {{worked with}} simple {{expansion}} {{so that the}} principle benefit sought would be the increased grate area. Compared with Drummond's standard <b>boilers,</b> the T7's <b>barrel</b> length was increased from 10 feet 6 inches to 12 feet.|$|R
500|$|In {{line with}} the {{philosophy}} behind Cole's Alco prototypes, the Gresley Pacifics were built to the maximum limits of the LNER loading gauge with a large boiler and wide firebox giving a large grate area. [...] The firebox was set low and rested on the trailing carrying axle. However, unlike the Pennsylvania K4, the firebox was not of the flat-topped Belpaire variety, but a round-topped one that was in line with Great Northern tradition. Features {{in common with the}} American types were the downward profile towards the back of the firebox and the boiler tapering towards the front. Heat transfer and the flow of gases were helped by use of a combustion chamber extending forward from the firebox space into the <b>boiler</b> <b>barrel,</b> along with a boiler tube length limited to , features inherited from the K4 type but not present on the earlier Cole Prototypes. The boiler pressure was rated at [...]|$|E
2500|$|The chassis, or {{locomotive}} frame, is {{the principal}} structure onto which the boiler is mounted and which incorporates the various elements of the running gear. The boiler is rigidly mounted on a [...] "saddle" [...] beneath the smokebox {{and in front of}} the <b>boiler</b> <b>barrel,</b> but the firebox at the rear is allowed to slide forward and backwards, to allow for expansion when hot.|$|E
2500|$|However {{the final}} example, 30583 (née 488), was {{purchased}} by the Bluebell Railway, chosen because of the three {{it was the one}} retaining the original pattern of boiler.

2500|$|Large {{amounts of}} heat are wasted if a boiler is not insulated. Early {{locomotives}} used shaped wooden battens fitted lengthways along the <b>boiler</b> <b>barrel,</b> {{and held in}} place by metal bands. Improved insulating methods included applying a thick paste containing a porous mineral such as kieselgur, or attaching shaped blocks of insulating compound such as magnesia blocks. In the latter days of steam, [...] "mattresses" [...] of stitched asbestos cloth stuffed with asbestos fibre were fixed to the boiler, on separators so as not quite to touch the boiler. However, asbestos is currently banned in most countries for health reasons. The most common modern day material is glass wool, or wrappings of aluminium foil.|$|E

5000|$|According to The Engineer of 1890:The Agenoria has upright {{cylinders}} working half-beams, {{thus reducing}} {{the stroke of}} the pistons to the cranks. The cylinders are 7 ½ in. diameter, with a stroke of 3 ft. There is a parallel motion to the piston-rod, and the feed pump is worked {{from one of the}} half-beams.

The excentrics for driving the slides are loose on the axle, with a clutch to drive either way, and there is hand gear to the valves to cause the axle to turn half round to bring the right clutch into action. The exhaust steam is discharged into the chimney, but it does not necessarily follow that it acted as a steam blast.

2500|$|Although Wheeling {{lost its}} {{position}} as state capital in 1865, {{it continued to}} grow. In the late nineteenth century, Wheeling was the new state's prime industrial center. One early nickname (until an 1885 strike) was [...] "Nail City", reflecting the iron manufacture in several mills which dated from the 1840s. Mills transformed pig iron into sheets which could be cut, and some mills also produced <b>boiler</b> plates, stoves, <b>barrel</b> rings and/or ornamental ironwork. Noted businesses of the era included the Bloch Brothers Tobacco Company (owned by state Senator Jesse A. Bloch who would in 1913 introduce legislation which became the state's Workmen's Compensation Act), and later steel concerns after development of the Bessemer process. Wheeling Steel Corporation was created in 1920 and grew after a 1927 strike caused J.P.

5000|$|Originally {{numbered}} 46, {{and named}} Newington {{it was built}} by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR) at their Brighton works, being delivered in January 1877; {{the average cost of}} the 44 locomotives built to this design in the 1874-80 period was £1,875. It is a member of William Stroudley's famous 'Terrier' class, which were officially known as the A Class (altered to A1 Class by D. E. Marsh). The original cylinders were of 13 inch mm bore by 20 inch mm stroke, the <b>boiler</b> had a <b>barrel</b> 7 ft long by 3 ft diameter, an iron firebox 4 ft long with a grate area of , and worked at a pressure of [...] The coupled wheels were nominally 4 ft in diameter, although this could vary from 4 ft with new tyres down to 3 ft when worn. When new, the brakes had wooden blocks, and could be operated either by steam or by hand. The Westinghouse air brake was fitted at some point between 1879 and 1882, replacing the steam brake; it operated the brakes on both locomotive and train. It was based in South London at Battersea; coal consumption returns of 21 Battersea-based engines for the year ending 31 December 1882 showed that no. 46 ran 21714 mi and burned coal at a rate of , both figures being slightly below the averages for the 21, which were 24728 mi and [...] respectively. A new boiler was fitted in 1890, which had a copper firebox with a grate area of , and the working pressure was increased to [...] New cylinders having a bore of 14 inch mm were fitted in 1894.

50|$|The first {{locomotive}} with {{a deliberate}} dome {{added to the}} <b>boiler</b> <b>barrel</b> was Stephenson's Rocket, although this was so small as to have little effect against priming. Many other locomotives built shortly after this date instead used either the 'haycock' boiler, where the firebox outer casing was raised high above {{the main part of}} the boiler, forming a steam dome, or Gooch's development of this where the semi-cylindrical firebox wrapper was raised above the <b>boiler</b> <b>barrel.</b>|$|E

5000|$|From a {{technical}} standpoint the Saxonia {{reflected in the}} main its English counterparts. Only a few details exist about {{the design of the}} boiler. The <b>boiler</b> <b>barrel</b> had rivetted longitudinal seams, the vertical boiler had a curved, cylindrical top. A flat plate on top of the vertical boiler provided a platform for the steam whistle and spring balance safety valve. On top of the front section of the <b>boiler</b> <b>barrel</b> was the tall, narrow steam dome. The grate was designed to be moveable.|$|E
50|$|The first boilers of {{this form}} had raised fireboxes that were {{considerably}} larger, particularly higher, than the <b>boiler</b> <b>barrel.</b> In the extreme case, this {{gave rise to the}} haycock boiler, where the firebox was raised into a vaulted dome. In most cases though, the firebox was merely larger by the width of the internal iron framing section. Around 1850, at the instigation of Crampton, the firebox adopted the flush-topped firebox casing, where it was of the same diameter as the <b>boiler</b> <b>barrel</b> and joined to it by riveted lap strips.|$|E
50|$|This {{increase}} {{still did}} not allow sufficient clearance between the <b>boiler</b> <b>barrel</b> and the 60 in diameter coupled wheels. Pockets in the <b>boiler</b> <b>barrel,</b> {{similar to those used}} on the earlier locomotives, were therefore still necessary. The boilers of the first two locomotives, numbers 905 and 906, were fitted with Coale patent safety valves, while numbers 907 and 908 had Ramsbottom safety valves. The eccentrics and motion were actuated from the driving (centre) axle instead of the trailing axle. The firebox had an inside width of 4 ft.|$|E
50|$|They {{were the}} first six-coupled engines in Bavaria and were {{developed}} specially for the route between Neuenmarkt, Wirsberg and Marktschorgast. This route had inclines up to 1:40. The loco had an inside frame, a <b>boiler</b> <b>barrel</b> without a steam dome, an inside Stephenson valve gear, single-sided, suspended Taschenkulissen and a rectangular ballast tank on the <b>boiler</b> <b>barrel</b> to increase the adhesion effect. A total of five were built by Maffei. They were named: SCHARRER, BEHAIM, LEIBNIZ, SAALE and SCHNEEBERG. There is a finely detailed 1:10 scale model of BEHAIM in the Nuremberg Transport Museum.|$|E
