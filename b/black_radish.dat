40|$|It was {{established}} that inclusion of <b>black</b> <b>radish</b> homogenate into model minced meat from different meat types (beef, pork, chicken) facilitates {{an increase in}} a degree of system hydrophilicity. In the experimental samples, the water binding capacity increased {{with an increase in}} the radish homogenate content at a level of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 % of meat weight. For example, in minced beef, it increased from 68 % (control) to 80 % (50 % of <b>black</b> <b>radish</b> homogenate), in minced pork from 55 to 73 %, in minced chicken from 72 to 82 %, respectively. An increase in water binding capacity in model minced meat was due to a pH shift from 5. 9 – 6. 05 to 6. 25 – 6. 43 (depending on a meat type) and the content of neutral salts in the dispersion system of the radish homogenate. An increase in moisture holding capacity was also established in model minced meat. The values varied from 10 % (models with minced chicken) to 25 % (minced pork) compared to control. In model minced meat, fibers and pectin substances of the <b>black</b> <b>radish</b> strongly bind water and act as a system stabilizer after thermal treatment.

Several {{studies suggest that}} cruciferous vegetable consumption may reduce cancer risk and slow the aging process. To investigate the effect of ITCs on cellular DNA damage, we evaluated the effects of two different ITCs [sulforaphane (SFN) and raphasatin (RPS) ] on the biology of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which, {{in addition to their}} ability to differentiate into mesenchymal tissues, contribute to the homeostatic maintenance of many organs. The choice of SFN and RPS relies on two considerations: they are among the most popular cruciferous vegetables in the diet of western and eastern countries, respectively, and their bioactive properties may differ since they possess specific molecular moiety. Our investigation evidenced that MSCs incubated with low doses of SFN and RPS show reduced in vitro oxidative stress. Moreover, these cells are protected from oxidative damages induced by hydrogen peroxide, while no protection was evident following treatment with the UV ray of a double strand DNA damaging drug, such as doxorubicin. High concentrations of both ITCs induced cytotoxic effects in MSC cultures and further increased DNA damage induced by peroxides. In summary, our study suggests that ITCs, at low doses, may contribute to slowing the aging process related to oxidative DNA damage. Moreover, in cancer treatment, low doses of ITCs may be used as an adjuvant to reduce chemotherapy-induced oxidative stress, while high doses may synergize with anticancer drugs to promote cell DNA damage...|$|E

Analysis of different food supplements such as soy (Glycine max) isoflavones, St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), garlic (Allium sativum), Ginkgo biloba and <b>black</b> <b>radish</b> (Raphanus niger) demonstrated the general applicability of the method. Due to different matrix effects observed in different food supplement samples, the standard addition approach was applied to perform correct quantitative analysis. In 56 out of 62 samples analyzed none of the 23 mycotoxins investigated was detected. Positive samples contained {{at least one of the}} toxins fumonisin-B 1, fumonisin-B 2, fumonisin-B 3 and ochratoxin A...|$|E
40|$|Brazil {{has been}} {{producing}} corn {{in almost all}} regions, although the costs of production increased in the last years. New techniques which provide economy without yield loss can motivate producers, as corn is an important culture used at crop rotation system. Green manure may reduce maize production costs, maily to the incorporation of nitrogen. Data from an experiment were used for these comparisons; treatments were conducted in three precedent corn cultures (<b>Black</b> oat, Oilseed <b>radish</b> and Hairy vetch) and six nitrogen fertilizers levels (zero, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 kg ha- 1). Corn after Black oat showed damage when N 25 kg ha- 1 was used, while increasing levels increased yield up {{to the level of}} N 150 kg ha- 1 where maximum yield is corn 1233 kg ha- 1. Corn after Oilseed radish showed in dose zero a yeild of corn 1500 kg ha- 1, but MEE occurs at level N 40 kg ha- 1. Corn after Hairy vetch has no response to N, so MEE occurs at N level zero, where yeild is corn 2100 kg ha- 1. Corn antecessor cultures that release more nitrogen could provide higher yield to the system with lower use of fertilizers...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{degradation}} in Brazil is {{a concern}} due to intensive agricultural production. Combining conservation practice, such as no-tillage, with winter cover crops may increase microbial activity and enhance soil quality more than either practice alone. This research evaluated the benefits of long-term (23 years) winter cover crops and reduced tillage on soil microbial quality indicators in an Oxisol from Paraná State, Southern Brazil. The winter cover treatments were: fallow, <b>black</b> oat, wheat, <b>radish,</b> blue lupin, and hairy vetch in conventional (plow) or no-tillage management; the summer crop was a soybean/maize rotation. Soil quality parameters included organic C, microbial biomass C and N, total and labile polysaccharide, easily extractable and total glomalin-related soil protein, and enzyme activity. Winter crops increased soil microbial quality parameters compared to fallow in both tillage systems, with greater relative increase in conventional than no-tillage. No-tillage had higher microbial biomass, polysaccharide, glomalin-related soil protein, and soil enzyme activity than conventional tillage. Including legumes in the crop rotation was important for N balance in the soil–plant system, increasing soil organic C content, and enhancing soil quality parameters {{to a greater extent}} than grasses or radish. The microbial parameters proved to be more sensitive indicators of soil change than soil organic C. Cultivating winter cover crop with either tillage is a beneficial practice enhancing soil microbial quality and also soil organic C stocks...|$|R
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDIn {{different}} parts of the world, medicinal plants have demonstrated a lot of health benefits to mankind and remains an important source for the discovery of new bio-active compounds. Libya is a typical example of a country where medicinal plants are widely used. Plant extracts of five Libyan medicinal plants were used in this study to investigate their in vivo effects on spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis in male rats and on ovulation and fertility in female rats. The In vitro effects of these plant extracts were also investigated on TM 3 Leydig cells and MCF 7 breast cancer cells. A phyto-chemical analysis of the five Libyan medicinal plants (flaxseed, <b>black</b> seeds, <b>radish</b> seed, date palm pollen and nutmeg) was done. The results showed that date palm pollen had a higher antioxidant activity than all of the above mentioned plants. In addition to this, Nigella sativa was observed to possess high flavonol content as well as high antioxidant activity. Male rats exposed to flaxseed, radish seeds and date palm pollen showed no significant alterations in body weight gain, whereas date palm pollen (240 mg/kg, p 0. 05) increase in Aspartate transaminase (AST) levels. Besides this, superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) in testis was increased significantly by radish seed (160 mg/kg), flaxseed (200 mg/kg) and date palm pollen (120 mg/kg). There was also improved catalase activity in testis of male rats exposed to radish seed and date palm pollen. Regarding male sexual behavior, the time to reach the female and the mount frequency decreased significantly in male rats exposed to flaxseed (300 mg/kg) and date palm pollen (120 and 240 mg/kg; p > 0. 05) thus, these plant extracts exhibit aphrodisiac properties. In addition, exposure of male rats to date palm pollen (120 mg/kg) produced a significant (p 0. 05). However, the relative uterus weights exposed to nutmeg (200 mg/kg) and date palm pollen (120 and 240 mg/kg) were significantly decreased (p 0. 05 or 0. 01) when the female rats have been exposed to black seed (200 mg/kg), nutmeg (200 mg/kg) or date palm pollen (120 mg/kg). The LH level significantly (p 0. 05). The creatinine activity in female rat serum in all treated groups was significantly decreased (p 0 · 05) and date palm pollen (500 μg/ml; p > 0 · 01). MCf- 7 cells treated with BS 10 - 50 μg/ml black seed and nutmeg 10 - 50 μg/ml significantly increased cell proliferation. However, the treatment with date palm pollen produced only a weak estrogenic effect, which resulted in a concentration dependent significant increase as observed between 50 - 1000 μg/ml date palm pollen. In conclusion, in this study, we observed that date palm pollen, radish seed and flaxseed increased libido as well as steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis, improved hepato and nephron-protective effects. In female rats, the plant extracts NM, BS and date palm pollen potentiated the production of gonadotropic hormones. In addition to this, at lower concentrations these medicinal plants promoted cell growth, whereas at higher concentrations they inhibited cell proliferation of MCF- 7 breast cancer cells. The anti-oxidant effects of these plant extracts have been implicated for the above mention effects...|$|R
40|$|The soil {{management}} systems cause {{changes to the}} aggregation and the stock of soil organic matter (SOM). The aim was to evaluate {{the influence of the}} winter cover crops and the tillage systems in aggregation and carbon (C) stock in soil and SOM fractions. The experiment started in 1986 at the Agronomic Institute of Paraná, in Pato Branco, in an Oxisol. The treatments are a combination of winter cover crops: black oat, rye, hairy vetch, common vetch, oilseed radish, blue lupine, wheat and fallow, and tillage systems: no tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT), in split plot design with three replications. Soil samples were collected in November 2012, in layers 0 - 5, 5 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm. In study 1, the aggregate stability were performed through wet sieving for determination of the mean weight diameter (MWD) and the aggregate distribution in diameter classes, and also the organic carbon (OC) in the aggregate. In study 2 only samples of plots <b>black</b> oat, oilseed <b>radish</b> and fallow, under NT and CT, were used in performing the density fractionation of SOM to obtain the free particulate organic matter (free-POM) and occluded particulate organic matter (occluded-POM) was performed. The concentration of C in soil and in free- POM and occluded-POM were analyzed by dry combustion, but the C concentration in mineral-associated organic matter (min-OM) was obtained by calculating the difference. The stock of C in soil and fractions of SOM and carbon management index (CMI) were calculated. In study 1, for all layers, the soil under NT had higher amounts of large aggregates that CT, which resulted in higher MWD of aggregates. The winter cover crops had no significant influence on the MWD of aggregates. The NT showed higher OC content of aggregates for the three diameter classes in the 0 - 5 cm layer compared to the CT. The highest levels of OC were found in the diameter classes > 2 and < 0. 25 mm in the three soil layers. In study 2, for the 0 - 5 cm layer, the NT had higher C stocks in soil, free-POM and occluded-POM compared to CT. And for winter cover crops, the soil with radish had the highest C stock for the free-POM in the surface layer. The min-OM promoted greater accumulation of C for all {{management systems}} and soil layers. The NT promotes an increase in the aggregation and soil C stock, and it enables greater action of protection mechanisms of SOM, indicating the higher quality of this system compared to CT...|$|R
