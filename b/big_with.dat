5|$|In 1993, {{after being}} fired from Uptown, Combs {{established}} his new label Bad Boy Entertainment as {{a joint venture with}} Arista Records, taking then-newcomer The Notorious <b>B.I.G.</b> <b>with</b> him. Both The Notorious B.I.G. and Craig Mack quickly released hit singles, followed by successful LPs, particularly Notorious B.I.G.'s Ready to Die. Combs signed more acts to Bad Boy, including Carl Thomas, Faith Evans, 112, Total, and Father MC. The Hitmen, his in-house production team, worked with Jodeci, Mary J. Blige, Usher, Lil' Kim, TLC, Mariah Carey, Boyz II Men, SWV, Aretha Franklin, and others. Mase and the Lox joined Bad Boy just as a widely publicized rivalry with the West Coast's Death Row Records was beginning. Combs and Notorious B.I.G. were criticized and parodied by Tupac Shakur and Suge Knight in songs and interviews during the mid-1990s. During 1994–1995, Combs produced several songs for TLC's CrazySexyCool, which finished the decade as number 25 on Billboard's list of top pop albums of the decade.|$|E
5|$|The embryos {{probably}} represented near-hatchlings. While {{the skeletal}} features {{were similar to}} those of the adults, the body proportions were very dissimilar. The head was <b>big</b> <b>with</b> a short snout and very large orbits, whose diameter amounts 39% of the entire skull length. The neck was short, contrasting to the very long neck in the adults. Girdle bones and caudals were relatively tiny. The forelimbs were of equal length to the hindlimbs, indicating that newly hatched Massospondylus were quadrupedal, unlike the bipedal adults. The discovery of hatching footprints with manus impressions confirmed their quadrupedality. These impressions show that the hand was not pronated, with palm faces facing each other and the thumb facing forwards. The unpronated manus and the big head indicate that an effective locomotion was not possible for newly hatched Massospondylus. Notably, the near-hatchings had no teeth, suggesting they had no way of feeding themselves. Based on the lack of teeth and the ineffective locomotion, scientists speculate that postnatal care might have been necessary. This is further supported by evidence that the hatchings remained at the nest sites until they had doubled in size.|$|E

25|$|With the {{formation}} of the Big 12 Conference in 1996, the Oklahoma Sooners became the Longhorns' main rival in basketball. Texas and Oklahoma are not traditional rivals in any sport other than football, due to their prior residence in different conferences (UT in the Southwest Conference and OU in the Big Eight Conference); nonetheless, the two basketball programs had already compiled a significant series history prior to formation of the Big 12, having met 14 times from 1947 to 1957, 11 times from 1986 until the beginning of Big 12 competition in 1997, and at various other times in the programs' histories. The Sooners entered the <b>Big</b> <b>with</b> a 29–13 lead in the all-time series, having won 10 of the 11 games played from 1986 to 1996. In the Big 12, the competitiveness of the Texas and OU basketball programs—which are second and third in all-time Big 12 regular season conference wins, respectively—only accelerated the development of the basketball rivalry.|$|E

25|$|Prior to his signing at Interscope, Don Trip scored <b>big</b> <b>with</b> his {{collaborative}} Step Brothers mixtape with Starlito. Released in 2011, the mixtape was {{peppered with}} references and in-jokes {{relating to the}} Judd Apatow movie Step Brothers, and gained a cult following among the rap community. A {{few months before the}} mixtape's release, Starlito and Don Trip were introduced to each other by Yo Gotti, with whom Don Trip was touring. Both rappers were already familiar with the other’s music, and after discovering their musical compatibility, decided to make a joint project. Three studio sessions later, Step Brothers was fully recorded. Due {{to the success of the}} mixtape as well as their collaborative chemistry, Starlito and Don Trip continued to collaborate, releasing the Step Brothers 2 mixtape in 2015. While Don Trip was based in Memphis while Starlito was based in Nashville, the two continued to meet up to record, never emailing each other songs back and forth. Eventually, in 2017, the two linked up again for the third installment of the Step Brothers series, preceded by the Karate in the Garage collaborative mixtape. Released independently, like the two previous mixtapes, Step Brothers 3 received widespread critical acclaim from publications such as Pitchfork, XXL, and USA Today.|$|E

In an interview for King magazine, Nas later confirmed that the song {{was intended as a}} diss towards The Notorious <b>B.I.G.,</b> <b>with</b> the line [...] "There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King."

It is a dynamic, explosive and fitting end to a remarkable, violent experience." [...] D. X. Ferris wrote, author of the 33⅓ book Reign In Blood (...) , that the song [...] "lunges to life with its core riff, the ten most recognizable notes in metal, a diminished-scale run down the fretboard that's the most badass guitar riff since Black Sabbath's 'Sweet Leaf'." [...] Guitarist Kerry King said that [...] "The intro is <b>big</b> <b>with</b> the two harmony and then the first beat that Dave [...] does, that double-kick thing, and it's like this backwards gallop that gets the crowd going wherever you are."

500|$|... "Lose My Breath" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins, Fred Jerkins, Sean Garrett, LaShawn Daniels and Jay-Z. The {{production}} of the song was handled by Jerkins, Beyoncé, Rowland and Garrett. Record producer Jerkins, who had previously collaborated with the group for [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), had worked on [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] without informing Destiny's Child. Beyoncé and Williams heard the drum instrumentation of the track and they enjoyed it with the latter feeling that the song was nothing like the mainstream radio sound. They went to their band mate Kelly Rowland presenting the song. Alongside Jerkins, the group asked for help from American rapper Jay-Z who immediately created a chorus including the lines [...] "Can you keep up" [...] without hearing the track. The group took his chorus and wrote the verses and bridge around it. During an interview with Complex, Garrett recalled the time he worked with Williams on the song, saying, [...] "There was so much magic {{going on in the}} studio. We probably recorded all the songs in about a month and every day it was a new song coming out. 'Lose My Breath' was towards {{the latter part of the}} album and that was an amazing song that we felt could not only be big on the radio but <b>big</b> <b>with</b> bands and marching bands.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1919 season Harry Frazee, then {{owner of}} the Boston Red Sox, sold a group of his star players to the New York Yankees.

No, No, Nanette was indeed first produced in 1925 by Harry Frazee, though the sale of baseball superstar Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees had occurred five years earlier. In the lore of the Curse of the Bambino, Frazee supposedly needed to sell Ruth among other reasons to make up for his lack of financial success up to that point in making Broadway shows, and it was hitting it <b>big</b> <b>with</b> No, No, Nanette in 1925 that paid off the loan.|$|E

2500|$|Following the split, the {{remnants}} of the Irish Volunteers were often, and erroneously, referred to as the [...] "Sinn Féin Volunteers", or, by the British press, derisively as [...] "Shinners", after Arthur Griffith's political organisation Sinn Féin. Although the two organisations had some overlapping membership, there was no official connection between Griffith's then moderate Sinn Féin and the Volunteers. The political stance of the remaining Volunteers was not always popular, and a 1,000-strong march led by Pearse through the garrison city of Limerick on Whit Sunday, 1915, was pelted with rubbish by a hostile crowd. Pearse explained the reason for the establishment of the new force when he said in May 1915: What if conscription be enforced on Ireland? What if a Unionist or a Coalition British Ministry repudiates the Home Rule Act? What if it be determined to dismember Ireland? The future is <b>big</b> <b>with</b> these and other possibilities.|$|E
