2500|$|His {{view for}} the Stone Age, {{following}} Lubbock, was quite different, denying, in The Ancient Stone Implements, any {{concept of a}} Middle Stone Age. In his 1881 parallel work, The Ancient Bronze Implements, he affirmed and further defined the three periods, strangely enough recusing himself from his previous terminology, Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age (the current forms) in favor of [...] "an earlier and later stage" [...] and [...] "middle". He uses Bronze Age, Bronze Period, Bronze-using Period and Bronze Civilization interchangeably.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of quantum coherence in multipartite systems {{is one of}} the basic problems in the resource theory of coherence. While the usual coherence measures are defined on a single system and cannot capture the nonlocal correlation between subsystems, {{in order to deal with}} the {{distribution of}} coherence it is crucial to quantify the coherence in <b>bipartite</b> <b>systems</b> properly. Here, we introduce incoherent-quantum (IQ) coherence measures on <b>bipartite</b> <b>systems,</b> which can characterize the correlations between systems. According to the IQ coherence measures on <b>bipartite</b> <b>systems,</b> we find the distribution of coherence of formation and assistance in bipartite systems: the total coherence of formation is lower bounded by the sum of coherence of formation in each subsystem and the entanglement of formation between the subsystems, while the total coherence of assistance is upper bounded by the sum of coherence of assistance in each subsystem and the entanglement of assistance between subsystems. Besides, we also obtain the tradeoff relation between the coherence cost and entanglement cost, distillable coherence and distillable entanglement in <b>bipartite</b> <b>systems.</b> Thus, the IQ coherence measures introduced here truly capture the nonlocal correlation between subsystems and reveal the distribution of coherence in <b>bipartite</b> <b>systems.</b> Comment: 12 pages, no figure.

40|$|Despite the {{abundance}} of <b>bipartite</b> networked <b>systems,</b> their organizing principles are less studied, compared to unipartite networks. Bipartite networks are often analyzed after projecting them {{onto one of the}} two sets of nodes. As a result of the projection, nodes of the same set are linked together if they have at least one neighbor in common in the bipartite network. Even though these projections allow one to study bipartite networks using tools developed for unipartite networks, one-mode projections lead to significant loss of information and artificial inflation of the projected network with fully connected subgraphs. Here we pursue a different approach for analyzing <b>bipartite</b> <b>systems</b> that is based on the observation that such systems have a latent metric structure: network nodes are points in a latent metric space, while connections are more likely to form between nodes separated by shorter distances. This approach has been developed for unipartite networks, and relatively little is known about its applicability to <b>bipartite</b> <b>systems.</b> Here, we fully analyze a simple latent-geometric model of bipartite networks, and show that this model explains the peculiar structural properties of many real <b>bipartite</b> <b>systems,</b> including the distributions of common neighbors and bipartite clustering. We also analyze the geometric information loss in one-mode projections in this model, and propose an efficient method to infer the latent pairwise distances between nodes. Uncovering the latent geometry underlying real bipartite networks can find applications in diverse domains, ranging from constructing efficient recommender systems to understanding cell metabolism...|$|R

By introducing the smooth max- and min- relative entropies of incoherent-quantum (IQ) coherence on <b>bipartite</b> <b>systems,</b> we exhibit the {{distribution of}} coherence in multipartite systems: the total coherence is lower bounded by the sum of local coherence and genuine multipartite entanglement. Besides, we find the monogamy relationship for coherence on multipartite systems by incoherent-quantum (IQ) coherence measures.
