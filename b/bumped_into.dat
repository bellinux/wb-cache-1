5|$|As New York {{opened up}} their season {{at home against}} the Dallas Stars on October 9, 2010, Tavares {{suffered}} a mild concussion late during the first period. The Stars' Adam Burish <b>bumped</b> <b>into</b> Tavares, and the latter was unable {{to return to the}} game. He scored his first career hat-trick on October 23, 2010, in a loss to the Florida Panthers. He then scored his second career hat-trick, as well as his first career natural hat-trick, on January 15, 2011, in a win against the Buffalo Sabres.|$|E
5|$|Later, the gangsters whom Chengcai <b>bumped</b> <b>into</b> earlier {{beat him}} up. Mr. Lim, {{who happens to}} be nearby, tries to protect his son, but suffers head trauma after being pushed down the stairs. He is taken to a hospital, {{critically}} injured. On his deathbed, Mr. Lim tells Chengcai that he loves him and that he should pursue his talent for fighting and then die. Witnessing this scene, the principal is touched and allows Chengcai to return to school. The boy eventually becomes an internationally recognised martial artist.|$|E
5|$|Neither Shepard nor Lovell {{expected}} {{there would}} be much difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14, but Apollo 13 went disastrously wrong. An oxygen tank explosion nearly resulted {{in the loss of}} the crew, and the moon landing was aborted. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who would offer to give Shepard back the mission each time they <b>bumped</b> <b>into</b> each other. The failure of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14 until 1971 so that modifications could be made to the spacecraft. The target of the Apollo 14 mission was switched to the Fra Mauro formation, the intended destination of Apollo 13.|$|E

5|$|On May 20, 2006, Barrett was {{involved}} in an infamous altercation with A. J. Pierzynski during the Chicago Crosstown Classic between the Chicago White Sox and Cubs. During the game's second inning, Brian Anderson hit a sacrifice fly, which allowed Pierzynski to score the game's first run. Pierzynski collided with Barrett en route to home plate, causing Barrett to fall down. Pierzynski showed his enthusiasm by slapping home plate. As Pierzynski got up, he <b>bumped</b> <b>into</b> Barrett, who proceeded to punch him. Scott Podsednik came to Pierzynski's aid and subdued Barrett. Anderson and John Mabry eventually joined the brawl before both teams emptied their dugouts and stormed the field.|$|E
5|$|Roger Stevens {{was working}} for the BBC as a film editor in the 1980s, and one morning, as he was {{travelling}} to work by train, he <b>bumped</b> <b>into</b> a BBC co-worker and they began to talk about Doctor Who episodes. The BBC projectionist mentioned that he had nine episodes of Doctor Who that Stevens could buy for £25. In the summer of 1981, Stevens bought The Space Museum episode one, The Abominable Snowmen episode two, The Moonbase episode four, Invasion of the Dinosaurs episode one, and three episodes of Carnival of Monsters. Stevens then contacted Ian Levine {{to find out what was}} missing from the BBC archive; Levine confirmed that The Abominable Snowmen episode two and Invasion of the Dinosaurs episode one were currently missing.|$|E
5|$|In early-1941 Stalin {{authorized}} the State Defense Plan 1941 (DP-41), which {{along with the}} Mobilization Plan 1941 (MP-41), called for the deployment of 186 divisions, as the first strategic echelon, in the four military districts of the western Soviet Union that faced the Axis territories; and the deployment of another 51 divisions along the Dvina and Dnieper Rivers as the second strategic echelon under Stavka control, which {{in the case of}} a German invasion was tasked to spearhead a Soviet counteroffensive along with the remaining forces of the first echelon. But on 22 June 1941 the first echelon only contained 171 divisions, numbering 2.6–2.9 million; and the second strategic echelon contained 57 divisions that were still mobilizing, most of which were still understrength. The second echelon was undetected by German intelligence until days after the invasion commenced, in most cases only when German ground forces <b>bumped</b> <b>into</b> them.|$|E

50|$|Water skaters (Halobates robustus) {{transmit}} predator avoidance behaviour {{through the}} group through {{the sense of}} touch: individuals {{at the edge of}} the flotilla detect a predator and move, <b>bumping</b> <b>into</b> their neighbours, who in turn start moving and <b>bumping</b> <b>into</b> more individuals.

However, Smurfette is still stuck in her cage, and Gutsy and Brainy {{try to figure out how}} to get her out of there when Gargamel appears with Azrael, and so they go into hiding while the evil wizard opens the cage to deal with the one Smurf that is still captured.|$|R

25|$|Johann Liechtenstein's blow on {{the right}} flank hit only air, as no French troops stood between him and Regensburg. Near Dünzling and Schneidert, Rosenberg <b>bumped</b> <b>into</b> Montbrun's cavalry, {{reinforced}} by two infantry battalions. With less than 4,000 troops, Montbrun conducted a brilliant delaying action against the IV Armeekorps all day, using the wooded terrain to good advantage.|$|E

25|$|Trying {{to exploit}} their success, Dolgorukov and Pahlen moved north where they <b>bumped</b> <b>into</b> Bernadotte's {{returning}} troops and quickly retreated.

This happened between 520 and 480 million years ago up to the Cambrian period. No associated ocean floor has been preserved by obduction in the ACT.|$|E

25|$|Ronstadt faced {{considerable}} pressure not {{to record}} What's New or record with Riddle. According to jazz historian Peter Levinson, {{author of the}} book September in the Raina Biography on Nelson Riddle, Joe Smith, president of Elektra Records, was terrified that the Riddle album would turn off Ronstadt's rock audience. Ronstadt did not completely turn her back on her rock and roll past, however; the video for the title track featured Danny Kortchmar as the old beau that she <b>bumped</b> <b>into</b> during a rainstorm.|$|E
25|$|When Clark {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} the Middle East in order to show his ability to handle foreign affairs issues, his luggage was lost, and Clark appeared to be uncomfortable with the issues being discussed.
