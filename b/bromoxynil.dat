50|$|<b>Bromoxynil</b> is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula HOBr2C6H2CN. It {{is classified as}} a nitrile herbicide, and as such sold under many trade names. It is a white solid. It works by inhibiting photosynthesis. It is moderately toxic to mammals.|$|E
5000|$|Ethylene bromide, {{obtained}} by addition of bromine to ethylene, was once of commercial significance {{as a component}} of leaded gasoline. It was also a popular fumigant in agriculture, displacing 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane ("DBCB"). Both applications are declining owing to environmental and health considerations. Methyl bromide is also an effective fumigant, but its production and use are controlled by the Montreal Protocol. Growing in use are organobromine biocides used in water treatment. Representative agents include bromoform and dibromodimethylhydantoin (“DBDMH”). [...] Some herbicides, such as <b>bromoxynil,</b> contain also bromine moieties. Like other halogenated pesticides, <b>bromoxynil</b> is subject to reductive dehalogenation under anaerobic conditions, and can be debrominated by organisms originally isolated for their ability to reductively dechlorinate phenolic compounds.|$|E
50|$|Recently, it {{has become}} {{apparent}} that some organisms, including Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans, originally evaluated for halorespiration on chlorophenols, can also use certain brominated compounds, such as the herbicide <b>bromoxynil</b> and its major metabolite as electron acceptors for growth.

5000|$|Few organoiodine {{compounds}} {{are important}} industrially, {{at least in}} terms of large scale production. Iodide-containing intermediates are common in organic synthesis, because of the easy formation and cleavage of the C - I bond. Industrially significant organoiodine compounds, often used as disinfectants or pesticides, are iodoform (CHI3), methylene iodide (CH2I2), and methyl iodide (CH3I). [...] Although methyl iodide is not an industrially important product, it is an important intermediate, being a transiently generated intermediate in the industrial production of acetic acid and acetic anhydride. The potential for methyl iodide to replace the ubiquitous dependence on methyl bromide as a soil fumigant has been considered, however limited information is available on environmental behavior of the former. [...] Ioxynil (3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile), which inhibits photosynthesis at photosystem II, is among the very few organoiodine herbicides.

40|$|For {{more than}} two decades acetolactate synthase (ALS) {{inhibiting}} herbicides have been the major weed control tools in winter wheat which resulted in selection of resistant weeds to those herbicides. Premix of pyrasulfotole & <b>bromoxynil</b> (Huskie®), a relatively new herbicide, was registered for use in wheat in 2008.

40|$|There are {{approximately}} 700, 000 acres of small grains planted in California. This represents wheat, triticale, barley, oats, and small grain forage mixes. Some {{of the major}} broadleaf weeds infesting small grains include mustards, fiddleneck, chickweed, malva, and burning nettle. Some of the important broadleaf herbicides used include 2, 4 -D, MCPA, Dicamba, and Carfetrazone (Shark). These herbicides are most effective when applied to small and actively growing weeds. Small grains vary in their sensitivity to these herbicides; for example, oat is more tolerant to MCPA than to 2, 4 -D. MCPA is often easier to tank mix with foliar nitrogen than some formulations of 2, 4 -D. <b>Bromoxynil</b> (Buctril), a contact herbicide, is effective on young seedling weeds.

40|$|Les dégradations du <b>bromoxynil</b> heptanoate et du <b>bromoxynil</b> ont été étudiées pour différents traitements chimiques (03, Cl 2) et photochimiques (H 202 /W; W 254) en milieu aqueux dilué. Les expériences ont été réalisées à pH 7 pour le <b>bromoxynil</b> (CO= 5 10 - 5 mol 1 - 1) et à pH 4 pour le <b>bromoxynil</b> heptanoate (CO= 10 - 6 mol 1 - 1) afin de limiter la réaction d'hydrolyse. Les résultats obtenus montrent une bonne dégradation de ces deux {{pesticides}} aussi bien par irradiation W que par oxydation chimique au chlore ou à l'ozone. L'ajout de peroxyde d'hydrogène dans le milieu n'augmente pas de façon significative l'efficacité du traitement {{par rapport}} à l'irradiation seule. Parmi tous les traitements étudiés, l'ozonation est le procédé le plus efficace. L'analyse par couplage GC-MS des produits de réaction au cours de l'irradiation UV a permis d'identifier quatre photoproduits correspondant à la substitution des atomes de brome soit par un atome d'hydrogène, soit par un groupement OH. Les produits identifés sont A: - 3, 4 dihydroxy - 5 bromobenzonitrile; B: - 3, 4, 5 trihydroxybenzonitrile; C: - 3, 4 dihydroxybenzonitrile; D: - 4 hydroxybenzo- nitrile. Un schéma réactionnel de photodégradation du <b>bromoxynil</b> heptanoate a été proposé dans cette étude. In the aquatic environment hydrolysis and phototransformation processes {{are the main}} abiotic degradation routes of chemicals. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the degradation pathway of 2 pesticides (<b>bromoxynil</b> heptanoate and its hydrolysis product <b>bromoxynil)</b> by UV photolysis and by chemical oxidation. The chemical oxidation processes studied are ozonation chlorination and radical oxidation with OH radicals. These radicals are produced by photolysis of hydrogen peroxide. <b>Bromoxynil</b> heptanoate (- 4 cyano - 2, 6 dibromophenyl heptanoate) is an ester which is quite unstable in aqueous medium. Preliminary experiments, carried out in diluted solution (C[inf]o= 10 -[sup] 6 mol l-¹) and in phosphate buffer (µ= 10 - 2 mol l-¹), showed that 20 to 25 % of <b>bromoxynil</b> heptanoate is hydroIyzed after 24 hours at pH 7. The hydrolysis decreases strongly with pH; it is only 3 % at pH 4 after one day. In order to limit the hydrolysis reaction, the following experiments were carried out at pH 7 for <b>bromoxynil</b> (C[inf]o= 5 10 -[sup] 5 mol l-¹) and at pH 4 for <b>bromoxynil</b> heptanoate (Co= 10 -[sup] 6 mol l-¹). The pH was adjusted with a phosphate buffer. Absorption spectra of <b>bromoxynil</b> heptanoate and <b>bromoxynil</b> do not show any absorption band up to 320 nm (<b>bromoxynil</b> heptanoate l max= 218, 290 nm; <b>bromoxynil</b> I max= 222, 280 nm; fig. 1). Therefore, the removal of these two pesticides by direct photolysis with the sun light will be very small. The measurement of the quantum yield (number of molecules undergoing photodegradation transformation per number of photons absorbed by these molecules) in the UV region in both monochromatic and polychromatic lights (HPK, Philips; I[inf] 0 = 1. 48 10 -[sup] 8 Einstein sec-¹, indicates that these 2 compounds are easily eliminated by a UV irradiation treatment (10 - 2 < F < 10 -¹ at I= 254 nm and 290 nm). The irradiation of these two pesticides at 254 nm (low pressure vapor mercury lamp, l[inf] 0 = 5. 8 10 -[inf] 8 Einstein sec-¹) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide does not seem to significantly improve the efficiency of the treatment by UV irradiation alone. For example, the half life time of <b>bromoxynil</b> is 11 minutes by UV compared to 8 minutes when hydrogen peroxide is present. This small difference of reactivity of H 2 O 2 /UV system is due to the small quantity of H 202 photolyzed during this irradiation time; at t= 8 min only 1 % of H 202 is decomposed. The oxidation of <b>bromoxynil</b> heptanoate and <b>bromoxynil</b> by ozonation was performed in a semi-batch reactor (Q= 5 mg O 3 min-¹). Results show that these two compounds are very reactive with ozone. 50 % of elimination was obtained after 5 and 2 minutes of ozonation for <b>bromoxynil</b> heptanoate and <b>bromoxynil</b> respectively. In both cases the transfer of ozone was the limiting factor. Finally chlorination of <b>bromoxynil</b> at a rate of 35. 5 mg Cl 2 -l-¹ indicates that this pesticide is also oxidized by chlorine but the degradation rate is quite slow; a total degradation is observed after 90 min of reaction. Comparison of the different treatments studied shows that ozonation is certainly the most effective process. Only a few minutes with reasonable ozone doses are necessary to eliminate these pesticides from aqueous medium. The other treatment (UV, H 2 O 2 /UV, Cl 2) can also be a good alternative for the removal of these compounds from water. For the different oxidation treatments, the HPLC analysis of the <b>bromoxynil</b> reaction mixture shows the formation of by-products. Only UV and H 2 O 2 /UV byproducts were identified in this work; but comparison of the retention times from the HPLC analysis indicates that certain by-products from ozonation are similar to the ones observed by UV and H 202 /UV oxidation. On the other hand, the products formed during chlorination, probably chlorinated products, have different retention times. The reaction intermediates werc identified by GC-MS analysis after 10 min of irradiation (with and without H 2 O 2). This time corresponds to the maximum concentration of one of the photoproduct. Two kinds of compounds wers identified from the GC-MS analysis: hydroxylated compounds (- 3, 4 dihydroxy - 5 bromobenzonitrile; - 3, 4, 5 trihydroxybenzonitrile) and hydrogenated compounds (- 3, 4 dihydroxybenzonitrile; - 4 hydroxybenzonitrile). In both cases the bromine atoms were substituted either by an H atom or by an OH group.

Here, we examine the ability of D. chlororespirans to debrominate and deiodinate the polysubstituted herbicides <b>bromoxynil</b> (3, 5 -dibromo- 4 -hydroxybenzonitrile), ioxynil (3, 5 -diiodo- 4 -hydroxybenzonitrile), and the <b>bromoxynil</b> metabolite 3, 5 -dibromo- 4 -hydroxybenzoate (DBHB). Stoichiometric debromination of <b>bromoxynil</b> to 4 -cyanophenol and DBHB to 4 -hydroxybenzoate occurred. Further, <b>bromoxynil</b> (35 to 75 μM) and DBHB (250 to 260 μM) were used as electron acceptors for growth. Doubling times for growth (means ± standard deviations for triplicate cultures) on <b>bromoxynil</b> (18. 4 ± 5. 2 h) and DBHB (11. 9 ± 1. 4 h), determined by rate of [14 C]lactate uptake into biomass, were similar to those previously reported for this microorganism during growth on pyruvate (15. 4 h). In contrast, ioxynil was not deiodinated when added alone or when added with bromoxynil; however, ioxynil dehalogenation, with stoichiometric conversion to 4 -cyanophenol, was observed when the culture was amended with 3 -chloro- 4 -hydroxybenzoate (a previously reported electron acceptor). To our knowledge, this is the first direct report of deiodination by a bacterium in the Desulfitobacterium genus and the first report of an anaerobic pure culture with the ability to transform <b>bromoxynil</b> or ioxynil. This research provides valuable insights into the substrate range of D. chlororespirans...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objectives}} of these laboratory experiments were: (1) to assess <b>bromoxynil</b> sorption, mineralization, bound residue formation and extractable residue persistence in a Dundee silt loam collected from 0 – 2 cm and 2 – 10 cm depths under continuous conventional tillage and no-tillage; (2) {{to assess the}} effects of autoclaving on <b>bromoxynil</b> mineralization and bound residue formation; (3) to determine the partitioning of non-extractable residues; and (4) to ascertain the effects of <b>bromoxynil</b> concentration on extractable and bound residues and metabolite formation. RESULTS: BromoxynilKd values ranged from 0. 7 to 1. 4 L kg− 1 and were positively correlated with soil organic carbon. Cumulative mineralization (38. 5 % ± 1. 5), bound residue formation (46. 5 % ± 0. 5) and persistence of extractable residues (T 1 / 2 < 1 day) in non-autoclaved soils were independent of tillage and depth. Autoclaving decreased mineralization and bound residue formation 257 -fold and 6. 0 -fold respectively. <b>Bromoxynil</b> persistence in soil was rate independent (T 1 / 2 < 1 day), {{and the majority of}} non-extractable residues (87 %) were associated with the humic acid fraction of soil organic matter. CONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of tillage or depth, <b>bromoxynil</b> half-life in native soil is less than 1 day owing to rapid incorporation of the herbicide into non-extractable residues. Bound residue formation is governed principally by biochemical metabolite formation and primarily associated with soil humic acids that are moderately bioavailable for mineralization. These data indicate that the risk of off-site transport of <b>bromoxynil</b> residues is low owing to rapid incorporation into non-extractable residues...|$|E
40|$|Combining {{herbicides}} {{for controlling}} broadleaf weeds and grasses in wheat farms {{has not been}} studied under Isfahan environmental conditions. Thus, this experiment was conducted in 1995 - 96 at the Agricultural Research Station, Isfahan University of Technology, in order to investigate the issue. In this study, 2, 4 -D+MCPA (U 46 Combi Fluid 6), <b>bromoxynil,</b> metribuzin, diclofop-methyl and tralkoxydim and their combinations in 11 treatments plus weed-free and weedy checks were evaluated using a randomized complete block design with 4 replications. Goldbachia laevigata and Avena fatua were the dominant weeds. Cirsium arvense and Convolvulus arvensis were of less importance. Efficacy of <b>bromoxynil</b> on annual broadleaf weeds was higher than 2, 4 -D+MCPA, while 2, 4 -D+MCPA was more effective on perennial broadleaf weeds. Diclofop-methyl and combination of <b>bromoxynil</b> with tralkoxydim were the most effective on A. fatua, while differences between treatments containing diclofop-methyl or tralkoxydim on decreasing A. fatua numbers were non-significant. The most and the least visual damages to wheat plants were caused by metribuzin and <b>bromoxynil,</b> respectively. Wheat yield was not significantly affected by treatments. However, the highest yield was obtained by tralkoxydim + <b>bromoxynil</b> treatment, which produced the lowest total dry weight of weeds at terminal spikelet and heading stages of wheat. The results obtained here indicate that combination of <b>bromoxynil</b> with tralkoxydim {{might be the best}} treatment for the control of all annual weeds under conditions similar to this experiment. But if perennial broadleaf weeds and wild oat are dominant in the field, combination of 2, 4 -D+MCPAwith diclofop-methyl might be preferred...|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the factors}} {{influencing}} the performance of <b>bromoxynil,</b> 4 (2, 4 -DB), or a companion crop for weed control in seedling alfalfa were studied in the greenhouse and at field locations in Farmington and Logan, Utah. The effect of application rate, stage of growth, temperature, and soil moisture on the phytotoxicity of <b>bromoxynil</b> and 4 (2, 4 -DB) to alfalfa and weeds were studied. Alfalfa yields were increased by 4 (2, 4 -DB) at all rates and stages of application. All rates and stages of <b>bromoxynil</b> treatment except the one-fourth pound per acre three to four trifoliate application resulted in alfalfa yields below that of the control. The use of a companion crop was not conducive to the growth and development of alfalfa although it did control the weeds. <b>Bromoxynil</b> at all rates and at both stages of application resulted in effective mustard control. Mustard control in the 4 (2, 4 - DB) plots was excellent at the early stage of application but required three- fourths pound per acre for control at the later stage of weed growth. Pigweed control was rather ineffective in <b>bromoxynil</b> plots at Logan where moisture was optimum, but effective in plots at farmington where moisture was limited for 18 - 20 days following application. The density of the pigweed stand in <b>bromoxynil</b> treatments at Logan was attributed to an influx of weed growth following initial control of weeds. Control of pigweed by 4 (2, 4 - DB) was in excess of 90 percent at the four to five leaf stage of weed growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of 14 substances, including {{a number of}} pesticides, to the eggs of the pest slug Deroceras reticulatum was determined in laboratory experiments. Eggs were kept in contact with a precisely defined artificial soil to which a range of concentrations of the test substances had been applied. Mortality of the eggs was assessed every 24 h and the median lethal doses (LD 50) were determined. The herbicides <b>bromoxynil,</b> ioxynil and pyridate + <b>bromoxynil,</b> the insecticides thiocyclam, diflubenzuron and azadirachtin, the molluscicides metaldehyde and methiocarb, and other compounds such as carvone, iron-EDDHA, saponin, and an extract of Pongamia pinnata, killed the eggs after periods of exposure ranging from 2 to 14 days, depending on the compound and the dose. Only two compounds, the insecticides imidacloprid and teflubenzuron, failed to kill the eggs of D. reticulatum {{at any of the}} doses tested. Values of LD 50 below 0. 01 mg a. i. cm- 2 were obtained for the herbicides <b>bromoxynil,</b> ioxynil and pyridate + <b>bromoxynil,</b> and for the biological pesticide azadirachtin. The feasibility of slug egg control in different contexts is discusse...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} {{mechanism of}} chloroxynil (3, 5 -dichloro- 4 -hydroxybenzonitrile), <b>bromoxynil</b> (3, 5 -dibromo- 4 -hydroxybenzonitrile) and ioxynil (3, 5 -diiodo- 4 -hydroxybenzonitrile) was studied in dimethylsulfoxide by the electrochemical methods combined with spectroelectrochemical and GC/MS {{identification of the}} products. DC polarography shows two irreversible reduction waves for ioxynil and only one reduction wave for <b>bromoxynil</b> and chloroxynil. Cyclic voltammetry at different scan rates and at various concentrations of pesticides {{is consistent with the}} radical anion formation followed by the subsequent chemical reactions. The main decomposition pathway includes the cleavage of the halogen atom and the dimerization of the dehalogenated intermediate. The differences in the mechanism of ioxynil, <b>bromoxynil</b> and chloroxynil are caused by the mutual differences in the rates of the bond cleavage and the dimerization process...|$|E
