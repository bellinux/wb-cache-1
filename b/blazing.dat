5|$|Troilus, however, {{after he}} had learned of his father's {{intention}} {{to go ahead and}} release Briseida and restore her to the Greeks, was overwhelmed and completely wracked by great grief, and almost entirely consumed by tears, anguished sighs, and laments, because he cherished her with the great fervour of youthful love and had been led by the excessive ardour of love into the intense longing of <b>blazing</b> passion. There was no one of his dear ones who could console him.|$|E
50|$|While {{the light}} blue paint <b>blazes</b> are usually {{vertical}} rectangles painted on trees {{to mark the}} trail, {{there is often a}} bit of variety in terms of both paint <b>blazes</b> and signage found on a Blue-Blazed Hiking Trail. Usually direction is indicated with one <b>blaze</b> to indicate 'go straight ahead', two <b>blazes</b> with the top <b>blaze</b> to the left indicating a left turn, two <b>blazes</b> with the top <b>blaze</b> to the right indicating a right turn, and two <b>blazes</b> directly {{on top of each other}} indicating the end of a trail (two parallel horizontal rectangles is the new preferred form). Three <b>blazes</b> indicates that the trail is forking in two different directions (as in a loop). But directional arrows are also often painted on rocks, trees and other stationary objects, particularly when they can provide better information (such as 'Up!' on a rock climb). Occasionally sticks or poles places in the ground are used instead of trees (especially in open fields) with a blue <b>blaze</b> or the top painted blue. Blue <b>blazes</b> are painted on telephone poles, road guard rails, buildings (rarely) and other signs (rarely). Sometimes wooden tags or wooden arrows are nailed to trees (or sticks stuck in the ground) though this is much more common on non-Blue-Blazed trails. Some trail sections are marked using blue plastic diamond signs or metallic disks nailed in trees rather than painted <b>blazes.</b>|$|R

5|$|At 22:00, while {{avoiding}} three drifting fireships, the overladen 120-gun flagship Océan ran aground and was badly scorched by a fireship which struck the stern. To prevent explosion the stopcocks were {{opened and the}} magazine flooded. As the crew wrestled with this threat, the drifting Tonnerre and Patriote loomed out of the darkness. Patriote turned away in time, but Tonnerre crashed into the starboard side of the flagship and caused considerable damage, although fortunately detached soon afterwards. Océans crew then held the <b>blazing</b> ship alongside long enough that the drifters could escape before releasing the fireship to drift on shore. During this effort at least 50 men tumbled to their deaths in the fiery chasm between the ships {{as they tried to}} prevent the fire spreading on board.|$|E

The gameplay features fast vertical scrolling and a wide array of weapons for the player to use.|$|E

5|$|In {{the seas}} off Lissa, British prize crews were making strenuous {{efforts to protect}} their captures; Corona was heavily on fire in {{consequence}} of her engagement with Active and the British prize crew fought the blaze alongside their Italian prisoners. The fire was eventually brought under control, but not without the death of five men and several more seriously burnt when the <b>blazing</b> mainmast collapsed. Problems were also experienced aboard Bellona, where Captain Duodo planned to ignite the powder magazine and destroy the ship following its surrender. Duodo had been mortally wounded in the action, and so ordered his second in command to light the fuse. The officer promised to do so, but instead handed control of the magazine to the British prize crew when they arrived. Duodo died still believing that the fuse had been lit.|$|E

5|$|No {{games in}} the series were {{released}} outside of Japan until two characters, Marth and Roy, were included as playable characters in the 2001 fighting game Super Smash Bros. Melee. Their popularity eventually convinced Nintendo to release the next game, The <b>Blazing</b> Blade, in Western regions under the title Fire Emblem in 2003. Many {{games in the}} series have sold well, despite a decline during the 2000s {{which resulted in the}} series' near-cancellation. Individual entries have generally been praised, and the series as a whole has been lauded for its gameplay, and it is cited as a seminal series in the tactical role-playing genre. Characters from multiple games have also been included in crossovers with other franchises.|$|E

5|$|The year 1956 was {{not very}} {{different}} from 1955 for Koufax. Despite the <b>blazing</b> speed of his fastball, Koufax continued to struggle with his control. He saw little work, pitching only 58.7 innings with a 4.91 ERA, 29 walks and 30 strikeouts. When Koufax allowed baserunners, he was rarely permitted to finish the inning. Teammate Joe Pignatano said that, as soon as Koufax threw a couple of balls in a row, Alston would signal for a replacement to start warming up in the bullpen. Jackie Robinson, in his final season, clashed with Alston on Koufax's usage. Robinson saw that Koufax was talented and had flashes of brilliance, and objected to Koufax being benched {{for weeks at a}} time.|$|E
5|$|Fire Emblem: The <b>Blazing</b> Blade is a {{tactical}} role-playing game where players take {{the role of}} story protagonists Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector as they navigate story-driven missions across the fictional continent of Elibe. The player takes {{the role of an}} unseen tactician directing the player army. The single-player campaign is divided into chapters which generally begin with story elements presented through the use of scenes animated with still images of the main characters, then followed by a battle with an enemy; after each battle, the player is given the opportunity to save their progress. In-game currency is gained either through battles in the game's Link Arena or through other means, rather than from defeating units. Currency can be used to buy new items and weapons at merchants in between battles and at specific locations within maps. Items can also be exchanged between units during battles.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the crumbling social system outside their walls, the prison film portrayed a universe where the state was all powerful and orderly. Sparked by the Ohio penitentiary fire on April 21, 1930 in which guards refused to release prisoners from their cells causing 300 deaths, the films depicted the inhumane conditions in prisons in the early 1930s. The genre was composed of two archetypes: the prison film and the chain gang film. In the prison film, large hordes of men move about in identical uniforms, resigned to their fate, they live by a well defined code. In the chain gang film, Southern prisoners were subjected to a draconion system in the <b>blazing</b> outdoors where they were treated terribly by their ruthless captors. The prototype of the prison genre was 1930's The Big House. 1932's I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is considered the seminal film of the chain gang genre. Although the chain gang film Hell's Highway had beaten Fugitive to the screen two months earlier, it exerted nowhere the influence.|$|E
