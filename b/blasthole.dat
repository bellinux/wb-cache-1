40|$|To {{investigate}} the blast-induced damage effect on surrounding rock in vertical shaft excavation, 4 kinds of millisecond blasting model tests with three-circle <b>blastholes</b> were designed {{and carried out}} with excavation blasting in vertical shaft as the background.

50|$|In rock blasting, {{sympathetic}} detonations {{occur when}} the blastholes are sufficiently close to each other, usually 24in or less, and especially in rocks that poorly attenuate the shock energy. Ground water in open channels facilitates sympathetic detonation as well. <b>Blasthole</b> spacing of 36in or more is suggested. However, in some ditch blasting cases sympathetic detonations are exploited purposefully. Nitroglycerine-based explosives are especially susceptible. Picric acid is sensitive as well. Water gel explosives, slurry explosives, and emulsion explosives tend to be insensitive to sympathetic detonations. For most industrial explosives, the maximum distances for possible sympathetic detonations are between 2-8 times of the charge diameter.

A field-scale investigation related to flyrock accident was conducted in an andesite quarry where rocks up to 50 cm in diameter were propelled almost 300 m {{from the center of}} blasting field causing extensive damages to the surrounding objects. The study revealed that accident occurred due to the existence of andesite alteration in one section of the blast field. The existence of this alteration caused a sliding of rock masses along the subsistent joint planes and thereby reduced burden for the second row of <b>blastholes.</b> Alterations involved small area of andesite masses that were not detected by previous geological exploration or visually observed prior to initiation of <b>blastholes.</b> The result of this filed investigation should {{have a positive impact on}} hazard awareness, prevention and safe blasting practices in mining and construction industries. ...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{economic}} gain {{the use of}} explosives for rock breaking has been the preferred choice in the mining industry for extracting minerals and the construction industries for driving tunnels and underground excavations. Although misfires are not an expected outcome in any form of blasting operations, however, due to the confined nature of underground blast the likelihood of <b>blasthole</b> misfires occurring is increased {{compared to that of}} a surface blast. Past research on the use of explosives for rock breaking have been concerned with issues about improving the effective use of explosive energy neglecting such effect as safety hazards and increased operational cost resulting from <b>blasthole</b> misfires. This research project investigate misfires in tunnel blasts with the aim of developing method(s) of minimising it occurrence during the blast design and identify <b>blasthole</b> misfires should they occur. Through a series of test blasts carried out at the Holman’s Test Mine operated by the Camborne School of Mines, three identification techniques based on blast emission data were developed namely; Electro-Magnetic Pulse (EMP Signature), Light (Optical Signature) and seismic (Vibration Signature). The study therefore concluded that whilst no one single method developed could effectively identify <b>blasthole</b> misfires in tunnel blasts, the vibration signature approach is the most pragmatic method for misfire identification in tunnel blasts as measurements are remotely undertaken. Moreover, blast vibration is well understood and part of almost all tunnel blasting operation. The blast vibration measurements and analyses undertaken {{during the course of this}} research resulted in the identification of potential <b>blasthole</b> misfires and aided in the safe retrieval of unexploded detonators and explosives cartridges. As a result of the research project several misfires were identified immediately after full face tunnel blasts at the Holmans’ Test Mine and appropriate measures taken to handle the misfires.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{details of}} CRC Mining’s work with waterjet assisted <b>blasthole</b> drilling. The {{objective of this}} work was to investigate techniques that reduce the cost and increase the productivity of <b>blasthole</b> drilling. The focus is on a technology that uses a high pressure waterjet to assist the conventional rotary rock cutting action of a tricone drill bit. The potential benefits of this technique are increased productivity, reduced drill bit wear and reduced hole deviation and hence improved quality of drilling. This paper describes {{the results of a}} laboratory based experimental program comparing conventional tri-cone drilling performance to the proposed waterjet assisted approach. Additionally, work has been completed looking at the more practical issues around the collection and sampling of drill cuttings and water recovery (recycling) when drilling with a waterjet. These studies have demonstrated that waterjet assisted drilling can significantly increase the rate of penetration over conventional rotary drilling. For the best-case experimental result, the relative improvement was over 40 per cent. More importantly, it is a starting point for examining alternative uses of the additional drill productivity obtained from waterjet assisted drilling. For example, increased drill productivity could be used to improve rock fragmentation by drilling a tighter <b>blasthole</b> pattern in the same time period. an existing drill fleet, then the drill fleet size could be reduced, or improved rock fragmentation could be achieved by drilling a tighter <b>blasthole</b> pattern within the same time period...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} gain better {{insights}} into the complex mechanisms at play under fully confined blasting conditions in mining applications, several models were constructed and analysed using the hybrid stress blasting model (HSBM). A disturbed zone or microdamage criterion was proposed and used in the modelling analysis. It combined a lattice bond contact tensile failure criteria and a simple peak particle velocity based approach. Estimates were made {{of the extent of}} fracturing, disturbed and interaction zones from fully confined <b>blastholes</b> spaced at distances of up to 18 m, simultaneously initiated with primers positioned every 8 m. Continuous interaction was evident along the explosive column at spacings of, 15 m. When <b>blastholes</b> were spaced at 18 m, the attenuation of the stress wave showed only partial or limited interaction along the column. With regards to the influence of in situ stress magnitudes in the range of 500 – 1500 m, modelling results appeared to capture the impact of stress intensity on the final extension of the macrofracturing zone. At depths of 1200 m and above, the degree of continuous interaction was diminished {{at the level of the}} initiating primers. For the simulated geotechnical conditions, the orientation of radial fractures with respect to the principal stress direction is more evident at anisotropy ratios greater than two. However, the extent and shape of the disturbed zone does not appear to be influenced by anisotropy, which showed a deficiency in the implementation of in situ stresses in the current modelling framework and further work is being conducted to address this limitation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract DEM (Distinct Element Method) {{models have}} found {{numerous}} applications {{in a number}} of engineering disciplines, such as material handling and transport, chemical, industrial, civil, mining and mineral processing. The thesis describes developments using PFC 3 D (Particle Flow Code in 3 D) for simulating rock fragmentation by commercial explosives. Emphasis is on the realistic simulation of explosive detonation in the <b>blasthole</b> as well as the flow of explosive gas from the <b>blasthole,</b> through the fracture network and venting to the atmosphere. Detonation can be initialized at any point along discretized blastholes and proceed up or down the hole according to the Velocity of Detonation of the explosive. Each of the explosive properties (pressure, density, extent of reaction, energy and their time derivatives) is computed according to the conservation equations and the explosive equation of state at any point along the hole. At initiation, the product calculation begins at the sonic locus with input of the detonation product provided by the non-ideal detonation code Vixen-n. The Taylor wave is then computed {{as a function of the}} <b>blasthole</b> expansion, which depends on the rock mass response to loading. The explosive gas is treated as a non-steady, compressible fluid and can flow through an arbitrary and evolving fracture network developed in the rock mass as a function of explosive loading. The fracture network (and flow paths) is defined by the coalescence of discrete macro-cracks. The gas has the effect of draining the <b>blasthole</b> and loading the fracture surface by its pressure and drag forces. Fracture intersection with free-surfaces is monitored and venting to the atmosphere is allowed. Validation of the fluid flow scheme is performed by comparing numeric results to analytic solutions for flow in shock tubes.

The model {{is based on the}} back-analysis of a comprehensive experimental program that included the direct measurement of the zone of crushing from 92 blasting tests on concrete blocks using two commercial explosives. The concrete blocks varied from low, medium to high strength and measured 1. 5 in in length, 1. 0 m in width and 1. 1 m in height. A dimensionless parameter called the crushing zone index (CZI) is introduced. This index measures the crushing potential of a charged <b>blasthole</b> and {{is a function of the}} borehole pressure, the unconfined compressive strength of the rock material, dynamic Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus and Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio. It is shown that the radius of crushing is a function of the CZI and the <b>blasthole</b> radius. A good correlation between the new model and measured results was obtained. A number of previously proposed models could not approximate the conditions measured in the experimental work and there are noted discrepancies between the different approaches reviewed, particularly for smaller diameter holes and low strength rock conditions. The new model has been verified with full scale tests reported in the literature. Results from this validation and model evaluations show its applicability to production blasting.

The data were analyzed for peak values of vibration and airblast and for frequency con-tent. Various delay intervals were used within and between rows of <b>blastholes.</b> Delay intervals within rows were 17 and 42 ms, and those between rows ranged from 30 to 100 msj these intervals are equivalent to 0. 5 and 1. 3 ms/ft within rows and 1. 2 to 4. 3 ms/ft between rows. Sub-sonic delay intervals within rows reduced airblast by 6 dB.

40|$|The {{ability of}} an {{explosive}} to break rock is influenced considerably by {{the extent of}} confinement in the <b>blasthole</b> and {{it is believed that}} confinement is improved by the use of stemming. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the first and second stages of results in developing a stemming performance testing and evaluation facility for small diameter boreholes. The results showed that different stemming products have differences in terms of their functionality, which can have a major impact on the efficiency of rock breaking. Two test procedures were used, one through the exclusive use of compressed air and the second using a purpose built high pressure test rig with small quantities of explosives. Both tests were used to identify and evaluate the ability of various stemming products to resist the escape of explosive gas through the collar of a <b>blasthole.</b> Extensive research was conducted to determine the types of stemming products most commonly used in South African underground hard rock mines, and the differences in design between the various products are discussed. The first stage of tests using compressed air only did not prove adequate to predict with certainty the pressure behaviour in the borehole of a particular product under high pressure conditions. The purpose built high pressure test rig did not prove to be a very effective tool to test stemming products under high pressure conditions. The test rig only incorporated the effect of gas pressure on the stemming product and in doing so omitted to take the effect of the shock wave into account. This study proved that to only take the gas pressure generated in the <b>blasthole</b> into account in not sufficient to effectively test stemming product design.

40|$|The desired {{economics}} of hard rock surface mining is mainly {{determined by the}} parameters of process design which minimize the overall cost per tonne of the rock mined in drilling, blasting, handling and primary crushing in given rockmass conditions. The most effective parameters of process design could be established based on the regression models of the cumulative influence of rockmass and mine design parameters on the overall cost per tonne of the rock drilled, blasted, handled and crushed. These models could be developed from the huge data accumulated worldwide on the costs per tonne of hard rock surface mining in drilling, blasting, handling and primary crushing vs the parameters of rockmass and mine design. This paper only dwelt {{on the development of}} regression models for oversize generation, <b>blasthole</b> productivity and blasting cost for iron ore surface mines, whose data is available.

40|$|Drilling {{with water}} has the {{potential}} to significantly reduce the respirable dust concentrations generated from small-diameter rotary drills when drilling <b>blastholes</b> on surface mining operations. However, water adverseky affects tri- cone drill bits commonly used in surface drilling operations, causing excessive wear and premature replacement. Consequently, dry drilling with a dust collector system has the most widespread use in the industry. Tests have been conducted by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NOSH), Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) on a newly designed device for smaller diameter drills that separates the water from the bailing air before it reaches the bit and thus provides the cost benefit of dry drilling while providing the benefit of wet drilling for dust suppression. The water that is delivered to the hole with the bailing air is separated from the air by a proprietary mechanical device that is encased in a drill sub (short section of drill rod/pipe) located immediately behind the cutting bit.

40|$|Sublevel caving (SLC) is a mass {{mining method}} {{relying on the}} {{flowability}} of the blasted material. The ore is blasted in slices against caved material which is mainly waste rock. The result of the confined blast is greatly influenced by {{the interaction between the}} blasted material and the caved material. During blasting both materials change characteristics; the blasted material increases its porosity and compressibility due to breakage and swelling while the caved material is compacted and decreases in porosity and compressibility. The understanding of the mechanisms involved in this process is of significant importance. The behavior of the caved material (confining material) was studied in laboratory under dynamic loading. A new apparatus was developed to conduct impact tests to simulate blasting conditions. The tested material was a blend of crushed waste rock from drift development in the Kiirunavaara mine with maximum particle size 32 mm. The material was tested for two conditions, i. e. dry and wet (pendular state), and with different impact velocities (low (5 m/s), medium (8 m/s) and high (10 - 12 m/s)). During the impact tests, two types of measurements were taken; dynamic measurements based on the recordings from the installed accelerometers on the machine and static measurements pre- and post-impact. Additionally, the angle of repose, the impact duration, and the fragmentation was measured. In addition to the laboratory tests, small-scale blasting tests were carried out to investigate the burden behavior in confined conditions. The blasted specimen was a cuboid magnetic mortar block and the confining material was crushed concrete with maximum particle size 16 mm. The blocks were instrumented with custom-made incremental displacement sensor. After the analysis of the results from the above experimental work, two confined pillar tests (test # 1 and test # 2) were carried out at the Kiirunavaara mine. The preparation work for the pillar tests involved the development of instrumentation and installation techniques. The experimental configuration contained two <b>blastholes</b> and measurement holes in between the <b>blastholes</b> drilled from the neighboring drift. Test # 1 mainly focused on the evaluation of the instrumentation and techniques while test # 2 was focused on the interaction between the blasted burden and the confining material. The confining material in test # 1 was a blend of ore and waste material from drift development at the Kiirunavaara mine. The characteristics of the material were unknown. Test # 2 was split into two parts, the confining material in the first part was the same as in the laboratory impact tests and {{the second part of the}} pillar was confined by caved masses. The instrumentation was installed in the burden of the pillars and was equipped with accelerometers and displacement sensor. Additional instrumentation was also installed in the confining material. The burden in the small-scale blasting tests reached maximum velocity 29 m/s and maximum displacement 12. 6 mm. In pillar tests, the burden movement was in the range of 0. 9 to 1. 1 m. In both pillar tests, burden erosion material was observed in the gap between the intact and the blasted burden. This material was finer compared to the blasted burden. The origin of this material was from the vicinity of the <b>blastholes.</b> The results of the laboratory tests showed that the wet material exhibited larger compaction zone than that of the dry material. The wet material showed apparent cohesion close to the impact surface of the tested material. A similar observation was made in test # 2 where an agglomeration of the confining material, as a result of apparent cohesion, was observed on the surface of the blasted burden. The displacement data from the instrumentation in the burden and inside the confining material showed that the compaction zone follows an inverse exponential behavior. After the blast steeper angles of repose were measured indicating higher frictional forces between the particles. Moreover, the evidence of apparent cohesion and a larger angle of repose indicated the introduction of tensile strength in the material. The mass of the confining material was compressed elastically and plastically during the blast. After the blast, the material recovered its elastic deformation and pushed the blasted burden backward as observed in the small-scale blasting tests and the pillar tests. At this stage, the burden erosion material was compacted. Hence, there were 3 materials, i. e. burden erosion material, burden and confining material, which were compacted with different compaction rates. This condition promotes interlocking of the particles in the materials. If this behavior is correlated with a production SLC ring, then it indicates disturbances in flowability of the blasted material...|$|R

40|$|Sublevel caving is {{a highly}} mechanizable mass mining method {{normally}} utilized in large, steeply dipping orebodies. The fragmented ore flows freely, aided by gravity, down to the drawpoint while the surrounding waste rock caves in due to induced stresses and gravity. Fragmentation of the blasted ore is a vital component in any mining operation and directly affects productivity and efficiency of the following production steps (Nielsen et. al, 1996). In an attempt to reduce mining induced seismicity in Malmberget, LKAB is initiating various trials. One of these trials involves a reduction in <b>blasthole</b> dimension {{and an increase in}} the number of blastholes utilized in each ring. A reduction in <b>blasthole</b> dimension is undertaken to achieve a less impactful mining operation in terms of disturbances to surface populated areas, particularly addressed to ground vibrations. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to analyse if fragmentation and production is affected as a consequence of this change. This thesis sets out to evaluate how fragmentation and the LHD operation is affected by variations in <b>blasthole</b> dimension. The evaluation is carried out through analysis of logged production data, on-site filming of the loading sequence and interviews with the LHD operators. The discoveries will be presented chronologically to illustrate the complexities related to compiling a viable dataset to rely on for a credible analysis. The initial theory did not hold up properly and therefore the project was reshaped along the course of progression to provide further information and clarify uncertainties. Unfortunate, major production delays inhibited a quantitative comparison of two parallel drifts with different <b>blasthole</b> dimensions. Hence, no final answer can be provided in this thesis whether a change in <b>blasthole</b> dimension causes any differences in loadability and/or fragmentation or not. However, an analysis of how cycle times vary depending on causes such as operator induced differences, machine induced differences and road conditions will be provided. The field test also provides information on various loading scenarios and the difficulties connected to these. The result obtained in this project mainly addresses the significant operator difference in terms of cycle times which can extend to, on average, 60 % depending on experience, road conditions and, most likely, preferences amongst operators. Time differences amongst seemingly experienced operators can reach more than, on average, 30 % in hauling time alone. Roughly 96 % of the operators state that road conditions in the production area is the controlling factor for hauling speed. Many of the operators further states that the risk of injuries is directly related to road conditions and this is a likely cause to why cycle times vary in this magnitude. Fragmentation was found to affect loadability but not to the same extent as shape and looseness of the muck pile. Compaction of the muck pile and flow disturbances where normally found to be connected to one another. Hence, good loadability would indicate a low occurrence of flow disturbances and a continuous flow of material into the drawpoint. This thesis is written as a part of the final stage of the civil engineering program at Luleå University of Technology (LTU) and represents 30 credits in the field of Soil and Rock Construction. The thesis is a part of a larger project, Face to surface, which sets out to analyse the impact of fragmentation on different stages in the production chain...|$|E
40|$|A {{geometrical}} {{model for the}} rock crushed zone around a cylindrical charge is developed. The model is used to obtain empirical relationships between the scaled crushed zone diameter and some dimensionless ratios of explosive and rock properties. The ratios are velocity ratio, characteristic impedance ratio, medium stress ratio, and detonation pressure ratio. The empirical relations for granite, salt, and limestone in combination {{with a variety of}} explosives show that the scaled crushed zone diameter increases at a decreasing rate with increasing dimensionless ratios. The shape of the wave fronts around a cylindrical charge detonating in rock has been constructed for velocity ratios ranging from infinity to less than one. The shape of the wave front is not planar in the range of dimensions used in full scale bench blasting. The shape of the wave front is cylindrical in the middle and spherical at the top and bottom for infinite velocity ratio; sphero-conical for velocity ratios greater than one; spherical for velocity ratios ≤ 1. Quasi-static finite element models for a <b>blasthole</b> in a full scale bench blasting are analyzed using a 2 -D finite element program written by the author. The models include a model neglecting radial cracks, models considering pressurized and non-pressurized radial cracks around the <b>blasthole,</b> and a model using an equivalent cavity to replace the pressurized radial cracks. Displacement fields, stress fields, and strain energy density distribution are studied. The analyses show that including radial cracks increases the levels of the strain energy density contours and the magnitudes of the displacement and stress fields several fold. The equivalent cavity gives much lower levels of strain energy contours and gives lower displacement and stress field magnitudes than those produced by the pressurized radial cracks. The scaled areas of the strain energy density contours increase at a decreasing rate with increasing the <b>blasthole</b> internal pressure and with increasing the ratio of the compressive strength to the tensile strength. These contour areas decrease at a decreasing rate with increasing tensile strength...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the outcomes of}} a joint project carried out by Glencore Ulan Surface Operations and Orica, to reduce total mine cost by optimising overburden blasts. Typical overburden blasts are 60 m wide and 1000 m long with the blasts designed to cast. Ulan Surface operations has a Marion 8050 dragline operating using the traditional Key-Low wall combinations, High Wall Chopping and Extended Bench according with spoil profile balance with a dragline production rate of 2000 bcm/hr. The objectives of the project were to: optimise post blast muckpile profile to improve dragline advance; improve cast percentage (%); reduce coal roof damage and edge loss; and control blast emissions {{and their impact on}} neighbours. The aim of these objectives is to reduce the total cost of mining. The use of Orica’s advanced blast modelling software, Distinct Motion Code (DMC), was essential in this as it allowed the analysis of alternative blast designs using the results from previous blasts in Strip 5 as the baseline. The results of the modelling indicated that there was scope to improve the cast % from a baseline of 23 % to a range of 25 - 35 % to final. In addition, the coal model was validated using touch coal and gamma logging data for each strip. From this information the <b>blastholes</b> were designed to stand-off from the coal seam and QA/QC approaches in the backfill and redrill tolerances were implemented. This paper also presents outcomes of this validation work...|$|R
40|$|The need {{to provide}} {{engineering}} solutions to full scale blasting problems has driven the development of several empirically based fragmentation models. Arguably, {{the most popular and}} successful models have been those applicable to surface blasting such as the Kuz-Ram model; and more recently the KCO model applying the Swebrec function. These models are based on what is generally described as the fragmentation associated with single hole firing conditions, that is, they do not consider the potential interaction of detonating <b>blastholes</b> on the breakage and fragmentation process. The application of precise and short delay timing using electronic detonators has demonstrated the need to incorporate modelling parameters that can adequately show the impact of timing on fragmentation. This paper describes an approach based on the hypothesis that a correction factor {{can be applied to the}} uniformity of fragmentation, the expected mean size of fragments and the proportion of fines generated during the blasting process. The correction factor is a function of the ratio between the interhole delay time dt and the minimum response time Tmin, which is defined as the time that elapses between explosive detonation and rock mass movement and is a function of explosive type, rock properties and blast design parameters. The use of this correction factor to predict relative changes in fragmentation from changes in interhole delay timing is demonstrated using a newly proposed two component Swebrec function. Preliminary data analysis demonstrates the practicality of the method. As with any empirical methodology, site specific calibration and further testing is recommended...|$|R
40|$|A {{discrete}} element {{computer program}} named DMC_BLAST (Distinct Motion Code) {{has been under}} development since 1987 for modeling rock blasting (Preece & Taylor, 1989). This program employs explicit time integration and uses spherical or cylindrical elements that are represented as circles in two dimensions. DMC_BLAST calculations compare favorably with data from actual bench blasts (Preece et al, 1993). Coal seam chilling refers to the shattering of {{a significant portion of}} the coal leaving unusable fines. It is also refereed to as coal damage. Chilling is caused during a blast by a combination of explosive shock energy and movement of the adjacent rock. Chilling can be minimized by leaving a buffer zone between the bottom of the <b>blastholes</b> and the coal seam or by changing the blast design to decrease the powder factor or by a combination of both. Blast design in coal mine cast blasting is usually a compromise between coal damage and rock fragmentation and movement (heave). In this paper the damage to coal seams from rock movement is examined using the discrete element computer code DMC_BLAST. A rock material strength option has been incorporated into DMC_BLAST by placing bonds/links between the spherical particles used to model the rock. These bonds tie the particles together but can be broken when the tensile, compressive or shear stress in the bond exceeds the defined strength. This capability has been applied to predict coal seam damage, particularly at the toe of a cast blast where drag forces exerted by movement of the overlying rock can adversely effect the top of the coal at the bench face. A simulation of coal mine cast blasting has been performed with special attention being paid to the strength of the coal and its behavior at t he bench face during movement of the overlying material...|$|R
