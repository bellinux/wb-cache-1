500|$|During pre-season, Wenger {{arranged}} {{a meeting with}} the players to examine why they lost the league. Martin Keown felt the manager harmed their chances by boasting they could go the season unbeaten. [...] "Look, I said that <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can do it. But you must really want it," [...] was Wenger's reply, as he believed the squad had the right mixture of technique, intelligence and physique. Arsenal did little transfer business given the financial demands that came with their new stadium project; their only major signing was Jens Lehmann, who replaced David Seaman as goalkeeper. Wenger retained his best players, despite interest shown by Chelsea's new owner Roman Abramovich. Six games into the league season, Arsenal were involved in a brawl against Manchester United; the ill-feeling stemmed from Vieira's dismissal late on. Several players were charged and fined accordingly by the FA and Wenger apologised for his team's overreaction. The team restored their image with an entertaining performance against Newcastle; Henry Winter in his match report wrote: [...] " [...] encapsulated all that is good about Arsenal, the slick passing and intelligent movement." [...] Wenger led his side to league triumph without a single defeat – an accomplishment last achieved by Preston North End 115 years before, in the Football League. [...] "Somebody threw me a T-shirt after the trophy was presented which read 'Comical Wenger says we can go the whole season unbeaten.' I was just a season too early!," [...] he remarked during the club's victory parade.|$|E

6000|$|... "And I {{should tell}} you the worst of {{anything}} at once, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{are one of the}} kind that don't like to have their conclusions made for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's not my secret. But I'll {{see what}} <b>I</b> can do, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> both <b>you</b> and Jon {{ought to be}} told. And now I'll say good-bye." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, {{about the}} child--our child--though, perhaps, I prefer to say MY child," [...] he began, {{with a certain}} brutal frankness. [...] "I'll tell you. But first, I don't want you to talk about BUYING your {{information}} of me. If I haven't told you anything before, it's <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> oughter know. If I didn't trust the child to <b>YOU,</b> it's <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> could go shashaying about with a child that {{was three years old}} when I"--he stopped and wiped his mouth {{with the back of his}} hand--"made an honest woman of you--I think that's what they call it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the story}} of that American friend of mine. I tell it to you <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can understand, and will know what to advise, what to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|Agatha smiled, but her glance was soft. [...] "I won't flatter you, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{ought to}} know. But {{why are you}} moody? I'd {{expected}} you to be sympathetic to rejoice with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see I've got to talk," [...] said Lister. [...] "Shillito was a cheat, {{but when}} you found him out you tried to jump off the train. You let me help <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> trusted me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I had an uncle, Alan Blair, {{who died}} {{forty years ago}} in California," [...] I said quietly. [...] "Recently I have had {{occasion}} to examine some of his papers. I found a journal among them and I have brought it to <b>you</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> have the best right to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you," [...] she {{reminded}} him, [...] "are {{not a perfect}} stranger. You have been a public man. You see, I am not afraid of hurting <b>you</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> will soon get over that little sensitiveness. I know all about you--everything. You trusted a woman. Ah! monsieur, it is dangerous, that." ...|$|R
6000|$|Agatha {{gave him}} a quiet ironical smile. [...] "Then you really came with me because you meant to stake a claim? That's curious, Mr. Thirlwell, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> never {{believed}} my father found the lode at all." ...|$|E
60|$|ATTEN. It must needs be {{so as you}} say, {{if these}} things be true that you have {{asserted}} of him. And I do the rather believe them, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> dare not tell a lie of the dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{be afraid}} of {{anything}} like that," [...] said Mrs. Easterfield, laughing. [...] "It may be somewhat of a breach of confidence, but I am {{going to tell you}} nevertheless; <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> deserve it; that I am also deputed to decline the addresses of Mr. Hemphill, and Mr. Du Brant." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2012 Blackman {{publicly}} criticised actor Sean Connery, her Bond co-star in the 1960s, for {{his status}} as a tax exile. She said,"I disapprove of him strongly now. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> should accept a title from a country and then pay absolutely no tax towards it. He wants it both ways. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> his principles are very high." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Prime, I am {{offering}} {{to make you}} my wife. I have said nothing of love, of that human affection which one of God's creatures entertains for another;--not, I can assure you, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> do not feel it, but <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> and <b>I</b> should be governed in our conduct {{by a sense of}} duty, rather than by the poor creature-longings of the heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} be accused in that way without {{defending}} myself. Let it be fancy or what not, I love Marion Fay, and I have come here to tell her so. If I can make any impression on her I shall come again and tell her father so. I am here now <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> can help me. If you will not, I shall go on without your help." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{speak the}} truth," [...] she said, searching him for {{proof of this}} apparently, with eyes now almost impersonally direct. It would be easy, Ralph thought, to worship one so far removed, and yet of so {{straight}} a nature; easy to submit recklessly to her, without thought of future pain.|$|E
60|$|My dearest Fanny,--I {{must use}} my {{opportunity}} of sending you these photographs, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> will care to have them. Peni is himself, not a likeness, but an identity. I, like a devil, or the Emperor Napoleon, am not {{as black as}} I seem; but Pen looks lovely enough to satisfy my vanity.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Wrong, how wrong?' she said, {{following}} him and clinging to him. 'You do not suppose that I {{would go to}} him <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> wrong? Do you not know that whatever might come I should cling to you? What is he to me compared to you? No; I will never speak to him about it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't {{propose to}} bother, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we're even. <b>You</b> helped us sell our claim and the Combine {{know what you}} were willing to pay. We raised them some; one could take it for granted you wouldn't reach just value." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] She {{said the}} word clearly and truly. [...] "And <b>I</b> will <b>think</b> myself a proud and happy and honoured woman to be so, Jeff. Oh, I don't shrink from telling you the truth, you see. You mean too much to me for me to {{dissemble}} it. I've hidden it for eighteen years <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> wanted to hear it, but I'll give myself the delight of saying it frankly now." ...|$|R
5000|$|Buchanan's {{work was}} {{featured}} at the Independent Art Fair 2017 at Andrew Edlin Gallery's booth. Buchanan has remarked, “A {{lot of my}} pieces have the word ‘ruins’ in their titles <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that tells <b>you</b> this object has {{been through a lot}} and survived — that’s the idea behind the sculptures … it’s like, ‘Here I am; I’m still here!'” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Kent, poor Mason has gone. He left {{a message}} for you, and I felt impelled to come and give it now, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> were touched by what we heard today, {{and in need of}} the help Mason tried to give you,' said the chaplain, taking the one seat and fixing his kind eyes on the grim figure in the bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{can make}} none. For some reason his {{relatives}} cast him off, and declined to claim me. I don't know why, and I shall never trouble to find out. I {{tell you this}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> ought to know. It is as Craig Harding, the prairie farmer, that I stand or fall; my own faults and merits are {{the only things that}} count." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I write at {{this time}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> may {{possibly}} be soon beginning your first Ordination Service in your Cathedral. It was almost my first thought when I began to think quietly after our 8 P.M. prayers. And I pray for those whom you may be leading to their work, as so often you have laid your hands on me. I understand Bishop Andrewes' [Greek text] now.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{early use}} was by Richard Holloway in an {{interview}} in Third Way in September 2001. You get cafeteria Christianity, a kind of shopping for ideas you approve of. They turned out to be right for the wrong reasons, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that once <b>you</b> admit that there are in scripture large sections that by our standards are not just inappropriate but scarcely moral - such as the justification of slavery...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{will do as}} you wish, Jean," [...] {{his wife}} said firmly. [...] "God has {{preserved}} us three thus far, and I trust that He {{will continue to do}} so. I shall have the less hesitation <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that, alone, <b>you</b> will have perhaps a better chance of escaping than with us. At any rate, we will carry out your instructions. But should we miss each other, is there no place where we can arrange to meet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I only ask <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{would have}} known it. Thank you for the {{assurance}} all the same, and in return I promise you I will use my best endeavors with the Comandante for your friend the Captain Bunker. Adieu, my daughter. Adieu, Madame Markham," [...] he said, as, taking the arm of Don Miguel, he turned with him and the doctor towards the guard-room. The secretary lingered behind for a moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do like you, Mr. Gregory!" [...] she relented, as if {{touched by}} his meekness, to the confession. [...] "You know I do--moa than I ever {{expected}} to like anybody again. But it's not because I {{used to like}} you, or <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> always acted nicely. I think it was cruel of you, if you ca'ed for me, to let me believe you didn't, afta that fust time. I can't eva think it wasn't, no matta why you did it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much, Zaki. You will {{brush my}} clothes, {{and make my}} bed, and do {{anything}} that I want done; but beyond that I cannot tell you. I am really taking you, not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> will be of much use, but because I like {{to have you with}} me. Besides, I sha'n't have much to do, and the English officer who commands will have plenty to look after, so that I shall be glad to talk, occasionally, with you.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, Sarah! It's <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> of <b>you</b> as {{apart from}} myself, that <b>I</b> can't <b>think</b> of <b>you</b> as <b>I</b> do of Ellen. I {{beg your pardon}} if I seemed to set her above you. But when I kissed you we were very young, and {{we lived in a}} simple day, when such things meant no harm; and I was very fond of you, and you were the holiest thing in the world to me. Is Ellen holy to that fellow?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The film also {{features}} minor roles {{for many of}} The Next Generations recurring characters; Dwight Schultz reprised his role of Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, while Patti Yasutake briefly appeared as Nurse Alyssa Ogawa.

5000|$|Maynard {{utilized}} superior wrestling to earn {{a unanimous}} decision victory by a score of 30-27. In 2009, Edgar credited this fight as a positive turning point in his career. [...] "The Maynard loss definitely opened my eyes. I started training with Ricardo Almeida and the Renzo Gracie team. That's where I've been the past year, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it had helped me tremendously." [...] He also anticipated an eventual rematch with Maynard. [...] "I think if Maynard keeps going where he's going, and I go where I plan on going, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we'll eventually have to meet up. That would be something that I'd {{like to see in}} the future, but I'm not dwelling on it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> if <b>you</b> dwell on losses you're not really going to focus on what you have ahead of yourself." ...|$|R
