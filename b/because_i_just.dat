500|$|Carter openly wept in {{the locker}} room after the game and was {{affected}} so badly by the loss that he considered retirement. [...] "Walking off that field and losing like that," [...] Carter reflected, [...] "I didn't even know if I wanted to play football anymore. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>just,</b> I felt like that I would never win after that." [...] He went on to call the game, [...] "The most devastating loss that I've ever been a part of." [...] Both Carter and fellow Hall of Fame member Randle believed that the 1998 Vikings team was their best chance at winning a Super Bowl; neither player would ever reach the Super Bowl in their careers.|$|E
500|$|In 1954, the 49ers {{compiled}} their Million Dollar Backfield, {{which was}} composed of four future Hall of Famers: Tittle; fullbacks John Henry Johnson and Joe Perry; and halfback Hugh McElhenny. [...] "It made quarterbacking so easy <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> get in the huddle and call anything and you have three Hall of Fame running backs ready to carry the ball," [...] Tittle reminisced in 2006. The team had aspirations for a championship run, but injuries, including McElhenny's separated shoulder in the sixth game of the season, ended those hopes and the 49ers {{finished third in the}} Western Division. Tittle starred in his second straight Pro Bowl appearance as he threw two touchdown passes, including one to 49ers teammate Billy Wilson, who was named the game's MVP.|$|E

500|$|The Stork Club {{was owned}} and {{operated}} by Sherman Billingsley (1896–1966) an ex-bootlegger who came to New York from Enid, Oklahoma. [...] The Stork Club first opened in 1929 at 132 West 58th Street, just down the street from Billingsley's apartment at 152 West 58th Street. Billingsley's handwritten recollections of the early days recall that he was approached by two gamblers he knew from Oklahoma in his New York real estate office, proposing to open a restaurant together, which he accepted. The origin of the name of the club is unknown; Billingsley once remarked, [...] "Don't ask me how or why I picked the name, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't remember." [...] New York City's El Morocco had the sophistication and Toots Shor's drew the sporting crowd, but the Stork Club mixed power, money, and glamor. [...] Unlike its competitors, the Stork stayed open on Sunday nights and during the summer months.|$|E
500|$|According to actress Marley Shelton, [...] "Rodriguez and Tarantino really co-directed, {{at least}} Planet Terror. Quentin was on set a lot. He had notes and {{adjustments}} to our performances and he changed lines {{every once in}} a while. Of course, he always deferred to Robert on Planet Terror and vice versa for Death Proof. So it's really both of their brainchild." [...] Tarantino has stated, [...] "I can't imagine doing Grindhouse with any other director in the way me and Robert did it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> had complete faith and trust in him. So much so that we didn't actually see each other's movie completed until three weeks before the film opened. It was as if we worked in little vacuums and cut our movies down, and then put them together and watched it all play, and then made a couple of little changes after that, and pretty much that was it." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{are other}} {{dimensions}} to the lyrics, with Gaga playing off her image of self-promotion and criticisms directed {{at her with}} the line [...] "I try to sell myself, but I am really laughing <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> want the music not the bling". In a review for Artpop, Simon Chandler from Tiny Mix Tapes gave {{a detailed analysis of}} the lyrical composition. According to him, Gaga wanted to portray her music as boundless in its meaning with [...] "Artpop", but it appeared to be arrogant since most of the conclusions derived about her music is from her public persona created and its media coverage. Chandler believed that the lyrics wanted to drive home a point about Gaga being the center for any discussion. With the previous lyrics, the implication is that Gaga's impassive personality utilizes her music to sell her brand name to the general crowd, and primarily fuels the public interest in her.|$|E

500|$|The Martian was {{directed}} by Scott and based on a screenplay by Drew Goddard that was adapted from Weir's 2011 novel of same name. 20th Century Fox optioned the novel in March 2013, and producer Simon Kinberg was attached to develop the novel into a film. The following May, Goddard entered negotiations with the studio to write and direct The Martian. Goddard wrote a screenplay for the film, and Matt Damon expressed interest in starring under Goddard's direction. Goddard then pursued an opportunity to direct Sinister Six, a comic book film about a team of supervillains. Kinberg then brought the book to Scott's attention. In May 2014, Scott entered negotiations with the studio to direct the film with Damon cast as the film's stranded astronaut. Scott said he was attracted by the emphasis on science and thought a balance could be struck between entertainment and learning. Damon said he was attracted by the novel, the screenplay {{and the opportunity to}} work with Scott. Following Scott's commitment, the project picked up the pace and was quickly approved. Goddard has since expressed that he felt Scott made a much better film than he could have directed, telling Creative Screenwriting, [...] "When it's Scott, collaboration is easy <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> revere him. Every day I would just look around and think, 'Is that really Ridley Scott sitting there at the table? This is exciting! ...|$|E
500|$|For three seasons, {{the backfield}} {{challenged}} opposing defenses with Tittle's arm, Johnson's power, {{the speed of}} Perry, and the elusiveness of McElhenny. [...] "There was no greater running backs than Hugh McElhenny, John Henry Johnson and Joe Perry in the same backfield," [...] Tittle reminisced. [...] "It made quarterbacking so easy <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> get in the huddle and call anything and you have three Hall of Fame running backs ready to carry the ball." [...] They achieved their greatest success during their first year together, in 1954, in which they shattered the team record for rushing yards in a season. The 49ers led the league with 2,498 rushing yards and 28 rushing touchdowns, and averaged 5.7 yards per carry and 208.2 rushing yards per game. Perry, McElhenny, and Johnson each finished the season in the top ten in rushing yards, with Perry and Johnson finishing first and second, respectively. McElhenny ranked eighth despite playing in only six games before being sidelined by a season-ending shoulder injury. Tittle, Perry, Johnson, and Detroit Lions halfback Doak Walker comprised the starting backfield in the 1955 Pro Bowl, and Perry was deemed the NFL's Player of the Year by the United Press. With the highly potent offense, many thought San Francisco was due to win a NFL championship, but defensive problems landed the 49ers in third place behind the Lions and Bears in 1954. Moreover, the offense struggled after McElhenny's injury.|$|E
500|$|With Fox not reprising her role, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley {{was chosen}} to play Sam's new love interest. Ramón Rodríguez was {{initially}} planned {{to be in the}} film, in a role bigger than the one he had in Revenge of the Fallen, but he was dropped during early production. Shia LaBeouf stated that this would be his last film in the series, also concluding that director Michael Bay will not return for a fourth installment, though it was later confirmed that Bay would return as director in the fourth film. A few well-known actors such as John Malkovich and Frances McDormand also gained selected roles for the film. Malkovich explains: [...] "I play a guy called Bruce Brazos, who's just a loudmouth, kind of business man who's Shia's character's boss. Who's just a jerk, and a kind of a loud one. But a fun character. Nice. It was fun. Very, very enjoyable, just with Shia, Rosie a little bit, and with John Turturro. So, for me, it was a blast." [...] Another well-known actor, Ken Jeong, was cast as an eccentric co-worker and stalker. Jeong described the film, [...] "Yeah, it's a small role in Transformers but yeah. I had an out of body experience working on that one <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> couldn't believe I was there. Still, that was not a thing where oh, I'm {{going to be a part}} of a blockbuster franchise like Transformers 3 or even now Hangover 2 for that matter. So I can't believe I'm a part of these franchises in any way. It was amazing. Michael Bay is brilliant and it'll blow your mind." ...|$|E

500|$|When an {{interviewer}} {{asked him to}} describe himself as a child, he replied that he was [...] "probably well-meaning and naive like all kids." [...] His passion for sea life {{can be traced to}} his childhood, when several films by French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau made a strong impression on him. He has said that Cousteau [...] "provided a view into that world", which he did not know existed. He liked to explore tide pools as a child, bringing home objects that [...] "should have been left there and that ended up dying and smelling really bad." [...] Also at a young age, Hillenburg developed his interest in art. His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration that he drew in third grade depicting [...] "a bunch of army men... kissing and hugging instead of fighting" [...] marked the first praise that he received for his work after his teacher commended it. [...] "Of course, this is 1970...

I remember that still, that moment when she said, 'oh my gosh, look at that,'" [...] Hillenburg elaborated. It was then when he knew that he [...] "had some [...] skill". Hillenburg asserted that his artistry comes from his mother's side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was [...] "really, really gifted" [...] and a [...] "great painter". In the 1970s, someone took him to the International Tournée of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Hillenburg was [...] "knocked out" [...] by the foreign animated films that were screened at the festival, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen's The Killing of an Egg (1977). [...] "That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on," [...] he recounted.|$|E

Duty then wrote a letter to Wise's mother Mary, in which he stated: [...] "Well {{by the time you get}} this letter you will already know that your son is dead.
