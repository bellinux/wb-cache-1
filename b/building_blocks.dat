5|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, the {{development}} of antiviral drugs has increased rapidly, mainly driven by the AIDS pandemic. Antiviral drugs are often nucleoside analogues, which are molecules very similar, but not identical to DNA <b>building</b> <b>blocks.</b> When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of these fake <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> are incorporated. As soon as that happens, replication stops prematurely—the fake <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> lack the essential features that allow the addition of further <b>building</b> <b>blocks.</b> Thus, DNA production is halted, and the virus can no longer reproduce. Examples of nucleoside analogues are aciclovir for herpes virus infections and lamivudine for HIV and hepatitis B virus infections. Aciclovir {{is one of the}} oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, {{substantially}} more reactive P(III) derivatives of nucleosides, 3'-O-chlorophosphites, were successfully {{used for the}} formation of internucleosidic linkages. This led to the discovery of the phosphite triester methodology. The group led by M. Caruthers took the advantage of less aggressive and more selective 1H-tetrazolidophosphites and implemented the method on solid phase. Very shortly after, the workers from the same group further improved the method by using more stable nucleoside phosphoramidites as <b>building</b> <b>blocks.</b> The use of 2-cyanoethyl phosphite-protecting group in place of a less user-friendly methyl group led to the nucleoside phosphoramidites currently used in oligonucleotide synthesis (see Phosphoramidite <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> below). Many later improvements to the manufacturing of <b>building</b> <b>blocks,</b> oligonucleotide synthesizers, and synthetic protocols made the phosphoramidite chemistry a very reliable and expedient method of choice for the preparation of synthetic oligonucleotides.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Noncovalent supramolecular {{assemblies}} possess {{in general}} several unique subunit−subunit interfaces. The basic <b>building</b> <b>block</b> {{of such an}} assembly consists of several subunits and contains all unique interfaces. Atomic-resolution structures of monomeric subunits are typically accessed by crystallography or solution NMR and fitted into electron microscopy density maps. However, {{the structure of the}} intact <b>building</b> <b>block</b> in the assembled state remains unknown with this hybrid approach. Here, we present the solid-state NMR atomic structure of the <b>building</b> <b>block</b> of the type III secretion system needle. The <b>building</b> <b>block</b> structure consists of a homotetrameric subunit complex with three unique supramolecular interfaces. Side-chain positions at the interfaces were solved at atomic detail. The high-resolutio...|$|R

5|$|Proteins are {{essential}} to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from amino acid <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. Protein synthesis consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel technique for detecting possible defects in two-dimensional wafer images with repetitive patterns using prior knowledge.

Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, as simple sticking becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger.|$|E

5|$|Oligonucleotide {{synthesis}} is {{the chemical}} synthesis of relatively short fragments of nucleic acids with defined chemical structure (sequence). The technique is extremely useful in current laboratory practice {{because it provides}} a rapid and inexpensive access to custom-made oligonucleotides of the desired sequence. Whereas enzymes synthesize DNA and RNA only in a 5' to 3' direction, chemical oligonucleotide synthesis does not have this limitation, although it is, most often, {{carried out in the}} opposite, 3' to 5' direction. Currently, the process is implemented as solid-phase synthesis using phosphoramidite method and phosphoramidite <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> derived from protected 2'-deoxynucleosides (dA, dC, dG, and T), ribonucleosides (A, C, G, and U), or chemically modified nucleosides, e.g. LNA or BNA.|$|E

The name poly(A) tail (for polyadenylic acid tail) reflects the way RNA nucleotides are abbreviated, with a letter for the base the nucleotide contains (A for adenine, C for cytosine, G for guanine and U for uracil). RNAs are produced (transcribed) from a DNA template. By convention, RNA sequences are written in a 5' to 3' direction. The 5' end {{is the part of}} the RNA molecule that is transcribed first, and the 3' end is transcribed last. The 3' end is also where the poly(A) tail is found on polyadenylated RNAs.|$|E
