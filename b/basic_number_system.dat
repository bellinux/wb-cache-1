5|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>number</b> <b>system</b> {{consists}} of a dot to represent one, and a bar to represent five. By the Postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero; during the Classic period other glyphs were used. The Maya could write any number from 0 to 19 {{using a combination of}} these symbols. The precise value of a numeral was determined by its position; as a numeral shifted upwards, its basic value multiplied by twenty. In this way, the lowest symbol would represent units, the next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty, and the symbol above that would represent multiples of 400, and so on. For example, the number 884 would be written with four dots on the lowest level, four dots on the next level up, and two dots on the next level after that, to give 4x1, plus 4x20, plus 2x400. Using this system, the Maya were able to record huge numbers. Simple addition could be performed by summing the dots and bars in two columns to give the result in a third column.|$|E
40|$|Many {{different}} number systems {{perhaps from}} the prehistoric era {{have been developed}} and evolved. Among them, binary number system {{is one of the}} simplest and effective number systems, and has been extensively used in digital systems. Studying number systems can help you understand the basic computing processes by digital systems. 1. 1 Positional Number Systems A good example of positional number system is the decimal number system in which we use them almost everywhere number is needed. Another example is the binary system that is used as the <b>basic</b> <b>number</b> <b>system</b> for all computers. In positional number systems, a number is represented by a string of digits where the position of each digit is associated with a weight. In general, a positional number is expressed as: d d ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ d d. d d ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ d m− 1 m− 2 1 0 − 1 − 2 − n where d {{is referred to as the}} most significant digit (MSD) and m− 1 d as the least significant digit − n (LSD). Each digit position has an associated weight b i where b is called the base or radix. The point in the middle is referred to as a radix point and is used to separate the integer and fractional part of a number. Integer part is in the left side of the radix point; fraction part is in the right side of the radix point. Fraction is a portion of magnitude of a number which is less than unit (e. g. fraction < 1) and thus it is called a fraction. Let D denote the value (or magnitude) of a positional number, then D can be always calculated by: m− i = − n 1 D = d ⋅...|$|E

It is further shown that fault detection is particularly easy in full adder arrays. The four neighbor full adder array can be tested for the presence of a single faulty cell by applying exactly eight tests, irrespective {{of the size of the}} array. The full adder arrays for practical applications turn out to be a little more difficult for fault detection. The number of tests is shown to grow almost linearly with the number of primary input terminals in these arrays.

The modern civilization is familiar with decimal <b>number</b> <b>system</b> using ten digits. However digital devices and computers use binary <b>number</b> <b>system</b> instead of decimal <b>number</b> <b>system,</b> using only two digits namely, 0 and 1 based on the fundamental concept of the decimal <b>number</b> <b>system.</b> Various other <b>number</b> <b>systems</b> also used this fundamental concept of decimal <b>number</b> <b>system,</b> for example octal <b>number</b> <b>system</b> and hexadecimal <b>number</b> <b>systems</b> using eight and sixteen digits respectively. The knowledge of <b>number</b> <b>systems</b> and their inter conversion is essential for understanding of computers.

Many students have problems acquiring the skills which lead to correct and immediate responses (automatic recall) for all the <b>basic</b> <b>number</b> facts. Knowledge of the <b>basic</b> <b>number</b> facts is essential for undertaking all computation efficiently. These basic facts are defined as 0 + 0 to 9 + 9 for addition and their subtractive opposites; and 0 x 0 to 9 x 9 for multiplication and their inverses in division.
