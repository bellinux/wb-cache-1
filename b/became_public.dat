5|$|The Adelaide leak was {{the revelation}} {{to the press}} of a dressing-room {{incident}} during the third Test, a cricket match played during the 1932–33 Ashes series between Australia and England, more {{commonly known as the}} Bodyline series. During the course of play on 14 January 1933, the Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull was struck over the heart by a ball delivered by Harold Larwood. Although not badly hurt, Woodfull was shaken and dismissed shortly afterwards. On his return to the Australian dressing room, Woodfull was visited by the managers of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team, Pelham Warner and Richard Palairet. Warner enquired after Woodfull's health, but the latter dismissed his concerns in brusque fashion. He said {{he did not want to}} speak to the Englishman owing to the Bodyline tactics England were using, leaving Warner embarrassed and shaken. The matter <b>became</b> <b>public</b> knowledge when someone present leaked the exchange to the press and it was widely reported on 16 January. Such leaks to the press were practically unknown at the time, and the players were horrified that the confrontation <b>became</b> <b>public</b> knowledge.|$|E

5|$|Cienfuegos led electors {{that were}} part of the {{imperial}} party in an attempt to elect Giulio Piazza. Piazza was almost elected on May 13, but was short by four votes. The electors were confident that {{they would be able to}} elect him, because more cardinals were arriving to participate in the conclave, and it <b>became</b> <b>public</b> in Rome that Piazza was likely to be the new pope. Albani did not support this because he had not been a part of the negotiations despite being the original elector to suggest Piazza, and undermined his election by proposing Vincenzo Orsini as an alternate candidate.|$|E

5|$|Enron's audit {{committee}} was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover {{large amounts of}} material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, the committee met {{for an hour and}} a half. Enron's {{audit committee}} did not have the technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to question the company's management due to pressures on the committee. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal <b>became</b> <b>public,</b> the audit committee's conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, U.S. President John Tyler, unaligned {{with any}} {{political}} party, decided independently {{to pursue the}} annexation of Texas {{in a bid to}} gain a base of popular support for another four years in office.

Through secret negotiations with the Houston administration, Tyler secured a treaty of annexation in April 1844. When the documents were submitted to the US Senate for ratification, the details of the terms of annexation <b>became</b> <b>public</b> and the question of acquiring Texas took center stage in the presidential election of 1844.|$|E
