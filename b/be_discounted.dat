Because des Roches travelled to Spain to {{the shrine of}} St James at Compostela, and {{it is known that}} Foliot accompanied him, the statement by a medieval chronicler from Dunstable that Foliot's destination was not certain, being either Rome or Compostela, should <b>be</b> <b>discounted.</b>|$|E
5|$|Paris {{is a city}} {{of books}} and bookstores. In the 1970s, 80 percent of French-language {{publishing}} houses were found in Paris, almost all on the Left Bank in the 5th, 6th and 7th arrondissements. Since that time, because of high prices, some publishers have moved out to the less expensive areas. It is also a city of small bookstores; There are about 150 bookstores in the 5th arrondissement alone, plus another 250 book stalls along the Seine. Small Paris bookstores are protected against competition from discount booksellers by French law; books, even e-books, cannot <b>be</b> <b>discounted</b> more than five percent below their publisher's cover price.|$|E

5|$|There was a {{great deal}} of {{controversy}} surrounding the case. Gordon received much support from his family and friends and maintained his innocence. There was a large amount of local interest in the trial as shown by the sales of the local paper, the North-West Evening Mail. Some claimed that much of the evidence against him could <b>be</b> <b>discounted</b> and there were vigils and petitions in attempts to free Gordon from prison and clear his name. The case featured prominently in the book No Smoke: The Shocking Truth About British Justice which outlined seven cases the author believed to be examples of innocent people being convicted of murder.|$|E
5|$|Detzner {{may have}} made {{attempts}} to reach West New Guinea, which was then neutral Dutch New Guinea, but his claims {{to have been the}} first outsider to enter the Papua New Guinea highlands can <b>be</b> <b>discounted.</b> In 1915, and again in 1917, Detzner and some of his men tried to escape along the coast in two canoes. In 1917, they reached the vicinity of Friedrich-Wilhelmshafen, which today is Madang. There lay anchored the Australian ship, HMAS Una, which earlier had been the German imperial yacht, the , designated for use by the German governor of the colony. The ship blocked any further travel, and ended any notions they had of a water escape to Dutch New Guinea. On this escape attempt, Detzner also learned the Australians had orders to shoot him on sight. He made one further attempt to escape overland to Dutch New Guinea, but had to be carried back suffering from an internal hemorrhage. He spent the remainder of the time investigating the island's inhabitants and its flora and fauna, particularly in the Huon peninsula and Huon gulf.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} {{accounts of}} Thomas's life are recounted in both Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus. According {{to the first}} account, Thomas first appeared in 803 accompanying general Bardanes Tourkos, and pursued a military career until launching his revolt in late 820. In the second version, he came to Constantinople as a poor youth and entered {{the service of a}} man with the high court rank of patrikios. Then, discovered trying to commit adultery with his master's wife, Thomas fled to the Arabs in Syria, where he remained for 25 years. Pretending to be the murdered emperor Constantine VI (r. 780–797), he then led an Arab-sponsored invasion of Asia Minor, but was defeated and punished. Classical and Byzantine scholar J.B. Bury tried to reconcile the two narratives, placing Thomas's flight to the Abbasid Caliphate at around 788 and then having him return to Byzantine service before 803, while the Russian scholar Alexander Vasiliev interpreted the sources as implying that Thomas fled to the Caliphate at Constantine VI's deposition in 797, and that his participation in Bardanes's revolt must <b>be</b> <b>discounted</b> entirely. The second version of Thomas's story is explicitly preferred by Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus, and is the only one recorded in 9th-century sources, namely the chronicle of George the Monk and the Life of Saints David, Symeon, and George of Lesbos. Nevertheless, the French Byzantinist Paul Lemerle came to consider it an unreliable later tradition created by his rival Michael II to discredit Thomas, and rejected it altogether, preferring to rely on the first account alone. Most modern scholars follow him in this interpretation.|$|E

40|$|In 3 studies, {{participants}} made choices between hypothetical financial, environmental, {{and health}} {{gains and losses}} that took effect either immediately or with a delay of 1 or 10 years.

There {{were no significant differences}} in the discounting of monetary and environmental outcomes, but health gains <b>were</b> <b>discounted</b> more and health losses <b>were</b> <b>discounted</b> less than gains or losses in the other 2 domains. Correlations between implicit discount rates for these different choices suggest that <b>discount</b> rates <b>are</b> influenced more by the valence of outcomes (gains vs. losses) than by domain (money, environment, or health). Overall, results indicate that when controlling as many factors as possible, at short to medium delays, environmental outcomes <b>are</b> <b>discounted</b> in a similar way to financial outcomes, which is good news for researchers and policy makers alike...|$|R

25|$|Once an asset's {{expected}} return, , {{is calculated}} using CAPM, the future cash flows of the asset can <b>be</b> <b>discounted</b> to their present value using this rate {{to establish the}} correct price for the asset.

In theory, an asset is correctly priced when its observed price {{is the same as}} its value calculated using the CAPM derived discount rate. If the observed price is higher than the valuation, then the asset is overvalued; it is undervalued for a too low price.|$|E

Furthermore, a succession of warlords – many of them claiming the title King of Dublin – made Dublin their principal power-base, and from there launched a series of military campaigns against enemies in Ireland, Britain and further afield.|$|E

The deal allowed Britain to hand much of the defence of Bermuda over to the still-neutral US, freeing British forces for redeployment to more active theatres.

25|$|Rotrou {{took part}} in the First Crusade, {{travelling}} with the army of the duke of Normandy, Robert Curthose. What influenced Rotrou in this regard were probably familial connexions. He was related to the Anglo-Norman aristocracy and the Perche was a march (border region) in southern Normandy. A sister was married to Raymond of Turenne, who was a fellow Crusader in the following of Raymond IV of Toulouse. His mother, Beatrix, was a sister of Ebles II of Roucy, who had campaigned in Spain in 1073, and Felicia, who married Sancho Ramírez, King of Aragon.
