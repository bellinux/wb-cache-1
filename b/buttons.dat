5|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{interface}} of the 3DS, {{as well as to}} take advantage of the touch screen, 3D has vastly unique controls when compared to other games in the Metal Gear series. While the game has been heavily criticized for these control changes, use of the Circle Pad Pro peripheral has been cited to alleviate much of the control issues of the 3DS. This is done by restoring camera movement to the second analog stick, adding ZL and ZR <b>buttons</b> for aiming and attacking, and allowing the face <b>buttons</b> to be used in a manner more in line with all other releases in the Metal Gear series.|$|E
5|$|In the two-player {{version of}} the game, a second game mode is added {{featuring}} two player-controlled rockets fighting each other instead of computer-controlled ships.

5|$|Sega AM2's {{first attempt}} in the genre was the 1993 arcade game Burning Rival, but gained renown {{with the release}} of Virtua Fighter for the same {{platform}} the same year. It was the first fighting game with 3D polygon graphics and a viewpoint that zoomed and rotated with the action. Despite the graphics, players were confined to back and forth motion as seen in other fighting games. With only three <b>buttons,</b> it was easier to learn than Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, having six and five <b>buttons</b> respectively. By the time the game was released for the Sega Saturn in Japan, the game and system were selling at almost a one-to-one ratio.|$|E

In reflection to his loyalties to home, this man, for example, could have adorned his uniform with Georgia State <b>buttons.</b> This would indicate to his fellow soldiers his allegiance to both his state and his military unit. This was common practice during the war for {{both sides in the}} conflict.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{control scheme}} uses a two-way {{joystick}} and five <b>buttons.</b> Jarvis designed the controls to emulate both Space Invaders and Asteroids simultaneously. The player's left hand manipulates the joystick similar to Space Invaders {{and the right}} hand pushes <b>buttons</b> similar to Asteroids. The button functions also use a similar layout to Asteroids, with the button to shoot projectiles and accelerate {{on the far right}} and left, respectively. Jarvis reasoned that players were accustomed to the control schemes of past games, and felt altering past designs would prove difficult for them.|$|E

40|$|An {{improved}} tensile adhesion <b>button</b> {{has been}} designed and tested that results in higher measured tensile adhesion strength while providing increased capability for testing high strength epoxy adhesive systems. The best attributes of two well-established tensile <b>button</b> designs were combined and refined into an optimized tensile <b>button.</b> The most significant design change to the tensile <b>button</b> was to improve alignment of the bonded tensile <b>button</b> specimens during tensile testing by changing the interface between the tensile <b>button</b> and the tensile test machine. The established or old <b>button</b> design uses a test fixture that pulls from a grooved annulus or anvil head while the new <b>button</b> design pulls from a threaded hole in the centerline of the <b>button.</b> Finite element (FE) analysis showed that asymmetric loading of the established anvil head tensile <b>button</b> significantly increases the stress concentration in the adhesive, causing failure at lower tensile test loads. The new tensile <b>button</b> was designed to eliminate asymmetric loading and eliminate misalignment sensitivity. Enhanced alignment resulted in improved tensile adhesion strength measurement up to 13. 8 MPa (2000 psi) over the established <b>button</b> design. Another design change increased the capability of the <b>button</b> by increasing the threaded hole diameter allowing it to test high strength epoxy systems up to 85 MPa(less than 12, 000 psi). The improved tensile <b>button</b> {{can be used in}} button- to-button or button-to-panel configurations...|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of the HP LaserJet 4000 in 1997, the control panel was {{completely}} redesigned. The Shift <b>button,</b> which might have been confusing, was gone.

There was a Select <b>button,</b> a large green Go <b>button,</b> and a small orange Cancel Job <b>button.</b> Configuration through the control panel was easier and more intuitive: menus could be navigated with the Menu <b>button.</b> Then, items within the menu selected with the Item <b>button.</b> The Value <b>button</b> - which had - (decrease) and + (increase) indications - could be used to select a specific setting or value. The Select <b>button</b> was used to select or confirm a particular choice. The display was adapted to a blue-backlit two-line LCD display.|$|R
