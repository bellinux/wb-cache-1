5|$|The gun {{was only}} {{initially}} {{known as the}} 41cm/45 3rd Year Type naval gun before it was redesignated as the 40cm/45 3rd Year Type naval gun on 29 March 1922 {{to comply with the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty which forbade guns larger than 40.6cm (16in). Third year type refers to the Welin <b>breech</b> <b>block</b> on which design began in 1914, the third year of the Taishō period. This <b>breech</b> <b>block</b> design was also used on the 20cm (7.9 inch), 15.5cm (6.1 inch), 14cm (5.5 inch), 12.7cm (5 inch), and 12cm (4.7 inch) naval guns.|$|E
5|$|The D-1 {{howitzer}} {{was essentially}} {{a combination of the}} barrel of the 152-mm howitzer model 1938 (M-10) on the carriage of the 122-mm howitzer M1938 (M-30). Since the new carriage was lighter than that of the M-10, the barrel was fitted with a massive double-baffle muzzle brake DT-3 to soften the shock of recoil. The <b>breech</b> <b>block</b> was of interrupted screw type, the recoil system consisted of a hydraulic buffer and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The separately loaded ammunition included a variety of shells and eight different propellant charges in cartridges.|$|E
25|$|This gun was {{designed}} as a smaller and lighter version of the 15 cm SK C/25 guns used as the main armament of the - and s. It shared the earlier gun's design with a loose barrel, jacket and breech-piece with a vertical sliding <b>breech</b> <b>block.</b>|$|E
50|$|That night, the Allies withdrew to Saint-Quentin. Of the 40,000 British troops {{fighting}} at Le Cateau, 7,812 British {{casualties were}} incurred, including 2,600 taken prisoner. Thirty-eight guns were abandoned, most having their <b>breech</b> <b>blocks</b> removed and sights disabled by the gunners first.|$|R
50|$|At the Armored Command and Artillery Command {{headquarters}} {{on the northern}} edge of the city the North Vietnamese planned to use captured tanks and artillery pieces but the tanks had been moved to another base two months earlier and the <b>breech</b> <b>blocks</b> of the artillery pieces had been removed, rendering them useless.|$|R
50|$|The Dreyse {{design was}} {{strongly}} influenced by John Browning's FN M1900, though the Browning had its recoil spring above the barrel, while the Dreyse had a concentric recoil spring. Nonetheless, the overall shape was the same, as was the grip angle and surface design, the magazine release, the positioning of the manual safety and the <b>breech</b> <b>blocks.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Type 1 47mm AT gun was a {{relative}} modern design {{compared to other}} Japanese Second World war designs, being relatively light and easy to handle. As with many Japanese designs, it had a very low profile and {{was intended to be}} operated from a kneeling or prone position. The gun had a gun shield to protect the gunner. The carriage appears to have adopted a number of design features from the Soviet ZIK 45 mm anti-tank gun, a number of examples of which were captured by the Japanese during the Battle of Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan) in 1939. It used a semi-automatic <b>breech</b> <b>block</b> with a horizontal sliding wedge. When the gun was fired the spent shell casing was automatically ejected, and upon loading a fresh shell, the <b>breech</b> <b>block</b> closed automatically. A hydrospring recoil mechanism was housed under the barrel. The weapon had a split trail which opened to an angle of 60 degrees for firing to improve stability. Transport was by towing behind a truck or horse, via two steel disc wheels fitted with sponge rubber filled tires.|$|E
25|$|BFAs for {{blowback}} and gas-operated firearms {{are relatively}} simple. These weapons depend on high pressures {{in the chamber}} generated by the combustion of the propellant to push the <b>breech</b> <b>block</b> to the rear, allowing another round to be chambered and fired. If a blank round is used, there is no bullet to seal the barrel, and the combustion gases exit through the muzzle without building up enough pressure to rechamber the next round.|$|E
25|$|The {{much longer}} and heavier MG FF {{had to be}} mounted farther along the wing in an outer bay. A large hole was cut through the spar {{allowing}} the cannon to be fitted with the ammunition feed forward of the spar, while the <b>breech</b> <b>block</b> projected rearward through the spar. A 60-round ammunition drum {{was placed in a}} space closer to the wing root causing a bulge in the underside. A small hatch was incorporated in the bulge to allow access for changing the drum. The entire weapon could be removed for servicing by removing a leading edge panel.|$|E
50|$|The Škoda 19 cm vz. 1904 was {{developed}} and built by Škoda at the Pilsen works. These guns used Krupp horizontal sliding <b>breech</b> <b>blocks</b> with separate loading metallic cased charges and projectiles. Unlike other large naval guns of the time which used separate loading bagged charges and ammunition, the 19 cm vz. 1904 used separate loading ammunition with charges inside of a brass cartridge case to provide obturation.|$|R
5000|$|Lonehort Fort, Bere Island, County Cork, Ireland- Two 6 inch BL {{guns are}} extant- <b>Breech</b> <b>blocks</b> are missing and the guns {{themselves}} somewhat rusty, but otherwise {{appear to be}} in good condition. The fort was open to the public on 14/03/14 and 15/03/14 for an underground art experience titled [...] "Nest", which took place in the shell rooms below the guns. The shell rooms and hoists are also in good condition.|$|R
50|$|The Model 1869 Cadet Rifle was a {{shortened}} {{version of}} the Springfield Model 1868. It had a 29.5 inch barrel, compared to the 32.5 inch barrel of the Model 1868, and had an overall length of 48.8 inches. The Model 1869 was produced using Model 1868 receivers and <b>breech</b> <b>blocks,</b> but used a stock that was manufactured specifically for the Model 1869. The Model 1869 had a narrower buttplate and the stock around the barrel was thinner than on the Model 1868.|$|R
25|$|The {{design of}} {{the action of the}} weapon {{combined}} functions of several different machine guns of the same era. The action consisted of a sliding <b>breech</b> <b>block</b> connected to a rotary crank, which in turn was operated by an off-set connecting rod, driven by the piston rod of the weapon. The feeding system was also unconventional, utilizing a box magazine mounted {{on the left side of}} the gun, holding 10 stripper clips with five rounds each. The stripper clips were fed one at a time through the gun from left to right where the empty clips were ejected (japanese type 11 light machine gun utilised similar feature). It used the rear sight and the barrel of the Krag–Jørgensen rifle.|$|E
25|$|Russian Empire Staff captain A.F. Brink had {{developed}} {{plans for a}} new six inch 35 caliber gun that was able to withstand 20% higher barrel pressures than existing guns. In 1882 development began for a new six inch naval gun that resulted in Brink's design being selected. Based on gun barrel material strength theories of lieutenant general N.V. Kalakutskij Obukhov State Plant produced the first 35 caliber gun in 1885. The design was a hoop gun with a total of eight layers besides the inner barrel: five mantle barrels, shroud, connecting and mounting rings. The gun was the first medium caliber gun used by Russia that had Treuille de Beaulieu screw <b>breech</b> <b>block</b> with de Bange obturator.|$|E
25|$|The {{siege of}} Plevna also signalled the {{introduction}} of the repeating rifle into European warfare. Russian troops at Plevna were largely armed with the M1869 Krnka, a single shot lifting <b>breech</b> <b>block</b> conversion of the muzzle loading M1857 rifled musket even though some units had been reequipped with the more modern, but still single shot, Berdan rifle. The old Krnka was soundly outperformed by the more modern single shot Turkish Peabody-Martini rifles and {{it became clear that the}} new Berdan rifle had also been rendered obsolete even as it was being introduced into service, outclassed by the Turkish Winchester repeaters. Reports of the heavy losses suffered by the Russian army at the hands of the Turks at Plevna forced armies across Europe to begin the process of either reequipping with repeating rifles or finding a way to convert their existing single shot rifles into magazine fed weapons.|$|E
50|$|The 320 mm naval gun was {{the main}} battery gun used to {{modernize}} Italy's World War I battleships for service during World War II. The guns were manufactured by boring out and relining the battleships' original 12"/46 (30 cm) built-up guns and modifying the turrets to increase elevation above the original 20° maximum. Each ship carried two 548-tonne twin turrets and two 745-tonne triple turrets. All guns used pneumatically operated side-swing Welin <b>breech</b> <b>blocks.</b> Each barrel could fire two rounds per minute.|$|R
5|$|Defections by {{units of}} the Greek Navy to the Venizelist factions {{provoked}} a Royalist purge of Venizelist officers and men from the Greek Navy. French Admiral Fournet, the Commander in Chief of the Allied Squadron, perceived the Greek fleet as a menace to the Entente powers in the Aegean. He delivered an ultimatum to the Greeks to sequester the small ships and disable the large ones. On 19 October 1916, the <b>breech</b> <b>blocks,</b> munitions, and torpedoes were removed from Limnos and Kilkis. At the same time, the crews were reduced to one-third of normal size.|$|R
5|$|Following Germany's capitulation, the Allies {{demanded that}} the {{majority}} of the High Seas Fleet be interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. On 21 November 1918, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, the ships sailed from their base in Germany for the last time. The fleet rendezvoused with the light cruiser , before meeting a massive flotilla of some 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow. Once the ships were interned, their <b>breech</b> <b>blocks</b> were removed, which disabled their guns.|$|R
25|$|In 1929 {{design work}} {{began in the}} Soviet Union for a new 130mm 45 caliber {{submarine}} deck gun that {{would have the same}} external ballistics as the older 130 mm/55 B7 Pattern 1913 gun. It was intended for the gun to use a wedge lock and fixed ammunition, but the plans were changed already before the prototype was ordered. Blueprints and a prototype was ordered from Bolshevik Plant no. 232 in 1930. The design bureau director was N.N.Magdasijev and project leader G.N.Rafalovits. Others involved in the design were S.A.Morozov, S.A.Zalazaev, B.A.Lever, V.M.Rosenberg and V.I.Kudrjashov. The gun design was changed from submarine to destroyer weapon using separate instead of fixed ammunition and in 1932 new specifications included a change from 45 to 50 calibers and a screw <b>breech</b> <b>block</b> instead of wedge block. During test firing in 1934—35 several shortcomings were found in the gun design, particularly with the breech and loading mechanism. Because the Leningrad class destroyers that were supposed to use the guns were already under construction the 130mm B-13 gun was accepted for mass production in 1935 and the first twelve guns were finished during the same year.|$|E
500|$|While off {{the island}} of Skiathos in the Aegean, she {{suffered}} a serious accident on 26 July 1929 during gunnery training. There was a misfire in the left gun of [...] "X" [...] turret; when the <b>breech</b> <b>block</b> was opened the propellant charge inside the barrel detonated, which ignited the charge for the next round. The ensuing explosion killed 17 men. Devonshire returned to England for repairs in August with [...] "the turret swung 'round and the guns awry". In 1929–30 she received a High-Angle Control System, used to direct her anti-aircraft guns, and a catapult was fitted in 1931–32. Four more single four-inch AA guns {{in addition to a}} pair of quadruple Vickers [...]50-calibre (12.7mm) Mark III machine guns were added in 1936–37.|$|E
500|$|The main {{armament}} was {{to consist}} of eight 40.6cm SK C/34 guns in four twin gun turrets. The 40.6cm (16in) gun was 50calibers long and fired at a muzzle velocity of 810meters per second (2,657ft/s). The guns were supplied {{with a total of}} 960 rounds of ammunition or 120 shells per gun; each shell weighed [...] The guns used a sliding <b>breech</b> <b>block,</b> as was typical for German naval guns of the period; the breech was fully sealed with a [...] brass cartridge that contained the [...] main propellant charge. A fore charge weighing [...] supplemented the main charge. The turrets allowed for elevation to 30degrees, which provided a maximum range of approximately [...] Rate of fire was expected to be two rounds per minute per gun. Fire control radar was unspecified, but the ships, which were to have been completed by 1944, presumably would have been equipped with an arrangement similar to that of [...] as she was outfitted in 1943–44. Several of the 40.6cm guns were constructed before work on the ships was halted; these were later employed as coastal guns, including at Battery Lindemann in France.|$|E
5000|$|These self-loading guns with lined {{monobloc}} {{construction and}} vertical sliding <b>breech</b> <b>blocks</b> weighed about 20 tons. Semi-fixed ammunition (projectile and powder case handled separately) with 78 pounds (35 kg) of smokeless powder gave a 335-pound (152 kg) projectile a velocity of 2500 {{feet per second}} (760 m/s). [...] Each gun could fire about ten rounds per minute. Useful life expectancy was 780 EFC per liner. Range was 17 miles (27 kilometers) at the maximum elevation of 41 degrees. [...] This gun was modified for the experimental Major Caliber Lightweight Gun.|$|R
2500|$|The 13mm {{centerfire}} [...] Reffye mitrailleuse cartridges {{were loaded}} into interchangeable steel <b>breech</b> <b>blocks</b> (unlike the Montigny mitrailleuse whose ammunition {{was held by}} the cartridge base in plates). When firing the mitrailleuse, three <b>breech</b> <b>blocks</b> were kept in continuous use: one being fired, one being pressed down on the extractor and one being loaded from a single pre-packaged 25-round box. Adjusting the elevation of the mitrailleuse in accordance to {{the distance to the}} designated target was performed with an elevating screw identical to that on a regular artillery piece. The mitrailleuse's barrel could also be moved sideways while firing, to the right and left, in order to adjust for range and provide lateral sweeping fire if needed. The lateral sweep was narrow, however, thus most effective at far distances only. The weapon's field of fire was so narrow that Prussian soldiers were often hit by several bullets at once. During an early engagement of the Franco-Prussian War, at Forbach in Alsace on August 6, 1870, a Prussian general officer (General Bruno von François) was brought down by a very closely spaced volley of four bullets. According to the Prussian regimental record, those four mitrailleuse bullets had been fired from 600meters away. French artillery attempted to rectify this problem by developing special ammunition capable of firing three bullets from the same cartridge for short-range point-defence.|$|R

500|$|The Mk 12 Gun Assembly (pictured) was a semi-automatic, power rammed, {{vertical}} sliding-wedge <b>breech</b> <b>block</b> type gun. Since {{this gun}} assembly fired semi-fixed ammunition, (pictured) each round {{was delivered to}} the guns in two pieces. Each gun, in this twin mount, had its own projectile hoist and powder case hoist from the upper handling room. The electric-hydraulic projectile hoist would deliver a projectile next to the projectile man with the nose down and waist high. The electric-hydraulic powder case hoist poked the case through a powder scuttle in the gun room's deck just next to the powder man's feet. [...] At the load command, the powder man would slip a primer protector {{off the end of}} the powder case, extract the case from the scuttle, and lift it into the gun's rammer tray. Meanwhile, the projectile man would pull a projectile out of the hoist, and place it in the rammer tray in front of the powder case. Then, as he turned to get the next projectile out of the hoist, the projectile man would pull down on the rammer lever. This caused the power rammer to ram the projectile and powder case into the chamber. As the powder case cleared the top of the breechblock, the block would rise to seal the chamber. The gun was ready to fire. The case combination primer in the base of the powder case could be fired either electrically or by percussion. Electrical firing was the preferred method because the firing circuit could be energized by firing keys down in the plotting room when firing salvos at surface targets, or up in the director when firing at air targets. Percussion firing could be executed by the Pointer (man controlling elevation) by pushing a foot treadle. When the gun fired, the recoil's rearward motion returned the rammer lever to the up position, and the rammer would drive back {{to the rear of the}} rammer tray. During counter-recoil, the breechblock was automatically lowered and the spent powder case was ejected from the chamber. When the gun returned to battery, a blast of compressed air was sent down the bore to clean it out. The gun was ready to be reloaded.|$|E

50|$|Most late-19th-century {{warships}} mounted naval artillery of {{more than}} one caliber because of uncertainty about the relative destruction possible from a few large shells (which might miss) in comparison to the increased hit probability of a larger number of less damaging small-caliber shells fired within the same time period. Quick-firing guns were initially breech-loading weapons firing ammunition small enough to be loaded by hand. Later substitution of brass cartridges for silk powder bags allowed increased rates of fire using sliding wedge <b>breech</b> <b>blocks.</b> Increasing mechanization ultimately enabled similar rates of fire from naval artillery calibers up to 8 in.|$|R
50|$|Whatever {{obturation}} {{that was}} achieved relied on manual labour {{rather than the}} power of the gun's firing, and was hence both uncertain, based on an unsound principle and unsuited to large guns. Armstrong screw-breech guns were initially adopted by the British Army and Royal Navy, but concerns about limited armour penetration of the shells due to limited maximum velocity, safety concerns with the <b>breech</b> <b>blocks</b> blowing out of guns, and higher skill levels demanded of gunners led the British Government to revert to rifled muzzle-loaders from 1865 to 1880, when Britain finally deployed reliable screw breech mechanisms.|$|R

2500|$|White {{invented the}} {{knife-edge}} <b>breech</b> <b>block</b> and self-cocking device for the [...] "box-lock" [...] Model 1851 Sharps rifle. [...] These rifles were built by White, Christian Sharps, and Richard Lawrence at Robbins & Laurence in Windsor, Vermont. [...] White later designed a self-cocking {{mechanism for the}} 1855 pattern Sharps and built 50 of these rifles for a potential US Navy contract, but the Navy only purchased 12 of them.|$|E
2500|$|The 24 cm SK L/40 was {{the first}} large caliber German naval gun to use a Krupp {{horizontal}} sliding wedge <b>breech</b> <b>block</b> and separate loading metallic cased propellant charges and projectiles. [...] Unlike other large naval guns of the time which used separate loading bagged charges and projectiles, this gun used charges inside of a brass cartridge case to provide obturation. [...] It is believed that the K94 and the K97 were both constructed of A tube, three layers of reinforcing hoops and a jacket.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{model used}} the Maynard tape primer, and {{surviving}} examples are marked Edward Maynard - Patentee 1845. In 1851 the second model {{was brought to}} the Robbins & Lawrence Company of Windsor, Vermont where the Model 1851 was developed for mass production. Rollin White of the R Co. invented the knife-edge <b>breech</b> <b>block</b> and self-cocking device for the [...] "box-lock" [...] Model 1851. This {{is referred to as the}} [...] "First Contract", which was for 10,000 Model 1851 carbines - of which approximately 1,650 were produced by R in Windsor.|$|E
50|$|Each Mark 4 {{built-up}} gun {{consisted of}} a tube, liner, and a screw box liner with a separate screwed-on flange. Three hoops and two locking rings were also included. The Mark 6 was slightly different in that it contained a single step taper liner and uniform twist rifling. Downward-opening Welin <b>breech</b> <b>blocks</b> and Smith-Asbury mechanisms were used on both Mark 4 and Mark 6 types. The Navy encountered dispersion problems at extreme ranges with these guns in the 1920s. Several methods were used to correct these problems, including correction of range tables for errors, addition delay coils, reduction of chamber volume, and improvement of shot seating.|$|R
5000|$|The Blish Lock {{resulted}} from Blish's observation of large naval guns. He {{noticed that the}} <b>breech</b> <b>blocks</b> of naval guns with interrupted thread breeches remained closed when fired with full charges, but tended to unscrew when fired with light charges. He concluded that dissimilar metals {{have a tendency to}} adhere to each other when subjected to very high pressure. This principle of metallic adhesion of dissimilar metals became known as the Blish Principle. Blish put this knowledge to use in a delayed-blowback breech lock. He developed a working model that used a simple wedge as the lock, and was eventually assigned [...] on March 9, 1915.|$|R
