5|$|The {{privilege}} of trial <b>by</b> <b>peers</b> was still ill-defined, and the statute did not cover peeresses. In 1442, after an ecclesiastical court (which included King Henry VI of England, Henry Beaufort and John Kemp) found Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester, guilty of witchcraft and banished {{her to the}} Isle of Man, a statute was enacted granting peeresses the right of trial <b>by</b> <b>peers.</b>|$|E
5|$|The last {{trial in}} the House of Lords was that of Edward Russell, 26th Baron de Clifford, in 1935 for {{manslaughter}} (he was acquitted); the following year the Lords passed a bill to abolish trial <b>by</b> <b>peers</b> but the Commons ignored it. The right to trial <b>by</b> <b>peers</b> was abolished when the Lords added {{an amendment to the}} Criminal Justice Act 1948, which the Commons accepted. Now peers are tried by juries composed of commoners, though peers were themselves excused from jury service until the House of Lords Act 1999 restricted this privilege to members of the House of Lords. The right to be excused was abolished on 5 April 2004 by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.|$|E
5|$|The {{privilege}} of access {{is no longer}} exercised, but it is possibly still retained <b>by</b> <b>peers</b> whether members of the House of Lords or not. In 1999, the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege recommended the formal abolition of any remaining {{privilege of}} peerage.|$|E

5|$|As a child, {{director}} Pete Docter relocated {{with his}} family to Denmark when his father moved to study the music of Carl Nielsen. While his sisters had an easy time adjusting to the new surroundings, Docter felt he was judged constantly <b>by</b> <b>peers.</b> While other kids were interested in sports, Docter sat alone drawing, a hobby that eventually led him to animation. His social anxiety ended by high school.|$|E
5|$|By {{the reign}} of Henry VII of England, there were two methods of trial <b>by</b> <b>peers</b> of the realm: trial in the House of Lords (or, in proper terms, by the High Court of Parliament) and trial in the Court of the Lord High Steward. The House of Lords tried the case if Parliament was in session; otherwise, trial was by the Lord High Steward's Court.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the PTC {{launched}} a campaign against the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), now World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), complaining that their SmackDown! program contained levels of sexuality and violence unbecoming prime time programming. In the campaign, Bozell said that four children had been killed <b>by</b> <b>peers</b> emulating professional wrestling moves learned from the program. With these allegations, Bozell and various PTC members began meeting {{with representatives of the}} advertising departments of various companies that advertised on SmackDown! to persuade them to withdraw sponsorship. The PTC also suggested that between 30 and 40 advertisers had pulled their commercials from WWF programming, an assertion that was not true.|$|E

25|$|Giving an {{exhaustive}} list of social liberal parties worldwide is difficult, largely because political organisations {{are not always}} ideologically pure.

25|$|Concerning the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, he {{has said}} that if {{corrections}} took place <b>by</b> <b>peers,</b> if there were a functioning process of serious review and assessment in light of Catholic doctrine by theologians competent to evaluate the work of one of their own, there would be much less work for members of the Congregation.|$|E

Over 200 baronetcies are now held <b>by</b> <b>peers</b> and others, such as the Knox line, have been made tenuous due to internal family dispute.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} was {{a consequence of}} admonitions in the Book of Rites that among adults it is disrespectful {{to be addressed by}} one's given name by others within the same generation. The true given name was reserved for the use of one's elders, while the courtesy name was employed <b>by</b> <b>peers</b> on formal occasions and in writing.

25|$|In some Western {{cultures}} shyness-inhibition {{plays an}} important role in psychological and social adjustment. It has been found that shyness-inhibition is associated with a variety of maladaptive behaviors. Being shy or inhibited in Western cultures can result in rejection <b>by</b> <b>peers,</b> isolation and being viewed as socially incompetent by adults. However, research suggests that if social withdrawal is seen as a personal choice rather than the result of shyness, there are fewer negative connotations.|$|E

25|$|An {{operational}} definition is {{the application of}} operationalization used in defining {{the terms of a}} process (or set of validation tests) needed to determine the nature of an item or phenomenon (e.g. a variable, term, or object) and its properties such as duration, quantity, extension in space, chemical composition, etc. Since the degree of operationalization can vary itself, it can result in a more or less {{operational definition}}. The procedures included in definitions should be repeatable by anyone or at least <b>by</b> <b>peers.</b>|$|E

25|$|Peer support {{occurs when}} people provide knowledge, experience, emotional, social or {{practical}} help to each other. It commonly {{refers to an}} initiative consisting of trained supporters (although it can be provided <b>by</b> <b>peers</b> without training), and can take a number of forms such as peer mentoring, reflective listening (reflecting content and/or feelings), or counseling. Peer support {{is also used to}} refer to initiatives where colleagues, members of self-help organizations and others meet, in person or online, as equals to give each other support on a reciprocal basis.|$|E
25|$|The {{experiences}} {{children go}} through {{during times of}} armed conflict can impede their ability to learn in an educational setting. Schools experience drop-outs of refugee and immigrant students from an array of factors such as: rejection <b>by</b> <b>peers,</b> low self-esteem, antisocial behavior, negative perceptions of their academic ability, and lack of support from school staff and parents. Because refugees come from various regions globally with their own cultural, religious, linguistic, and home practices, the new school culture can conflict with the home culture, causing tension between the student and their family.|$|E
25|$|In Eastern {{cultures}} shyness-inhibition in school-aged {{children is}} seen as positive and those that exhibit these traits are viewed well <b>by</b> <b>peers</b> and are accepted. They tended {{to be seen as}} competent by their teachers, to perform well in school and to show well-being. Shy individuals {{are also more likely to}} attain leadership status in school. Being shy or inhibited does not correlate with loneliness or depression as those in the West do. In Eastern cultures being shy and inhibited is a sign of politeness, respectfulness, and thoughtfulness.|$|E
