5|$|Alston guided {{his teams}} {{to at least}} 85 wins per season between 1969 and 1976. They {{finished}} in second place in their division six times during that span. The team {{came very close to}} a pennant in 1971; after falling 11 games out of first place, the team performed well late in the season and finished one game behind the San Francisco Giants.

50|$|In 1976, Yeager {{was injured}} when {{teammate}} <b>Bill</b> <b>Russell's</b> bat shattered and a large, jagged piece hit Yeager, {{who was in}} the on-deck circle. The wood hit him in the neck and pierced his esophagus, necessitating surgery. After the incident, Dodger trainer Bill Buhler invented and patented device hangs from the catcher's mask to protect the throat. It was soon worn by most catchers around the Majors and other leagues.|$|R
500|$|The New York Times in 1966 wrote [...] "Russell's main {{characteristics}} are pride, intelligence, {{an active and}} appreciative sense of humor, a preoccupation with dignity, a capacity for consideration once his friendship or sympathy has been aroused, and an unwillingness to compromise whatever truths he has accepted." [...] Russell himself in 2009 wrote his paternal grandfather's motto, passed down to his father and thence to him is: [...] "A man has {{to draw a line}} inside himself that he won't allow any man to cross"; Russell was [...] "proud of my Grandfather's heroic dignity against forces more powerful than him... he would not allow himself to be oppressed or intimidated by anyone"; he wrote these words after recounting how that grandfather stood up to the Ku Klux Klan and whites who attempted to thwart his efforts to build a schoolhouse for black children (Jake Russell was the first person in <b>Bill</b> <b>Russell's</b> patrilineal line born free in North America, and was himself illiterate). Thus <b>Bill</b> <b>Russell's</b> motto became [...] "If you disrespect that line, you disrespect me." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to coaching, Auerbach {{was a highly}} effective mentor; several players coached by Auerbach would become successful coaches themselves. <b>Bill</b> <b>Russell</b> won two titles as Auerbach's successor, Tom Heinsohn won a pair of championships as a Celtics coach in the 1970s, K.C. Jones led the Celtics to two further titles in the 1980s, and Bill Sharman coached the Los Angeles Lakers to their first title in 1972. In addition, prototypical sixth man Don Nelson had a highly successful coaching career and joined his mentor Auerbach as one of 10 Greatest Coaches in NBA history.|$|E
5|$|Kevin Wayne Durant (born September 29, 1988) is an American {{professional}} basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He has won an NBA championship, an NBA Most Valuable Player Award, the <b>Bill</b> <b>Russell</b> NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award, the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award, four NBA scoring titles, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, and two Olympic gold medals. Durant {{has also been}} selected to seven All-NBA teams and eight NBA All-Star teams.|$|E
5|$|Quadruple-doubles {{have only}} been {{possible}} since the 1973–74 season, when the NBA started recording both blocked shots and steals. It is often speculated by observers that other all-time greats, namely Oscar Robertson (all time triple-doubles leader with 181), Wilt Chamberlain, <b>Bill</b> <b>Russell</b> and Jerry West could conceivably have had quadruple-doubles. West's biography at NBA.com claims that he once recorded an unofficial quadruple-double with 44points, 12rebounds, 10assists and 10blocks. A biography of Wilt Chamberlain claims that he also recorded an unofficial quadruple-double in Game1 of the 1967 Eastern Division Finals against the Boston Celtics, when he had 24points, 32rebounds, 13assists and 12blocks.|$|E

5|$|Among Auerbach's accomplishments {{during his}} 20-year {{professional}} coaching career were eleven Eastern Division titles (including nine {{in a row}} from 1957–65), 11 appearances in the finals (including ten in a row from 1957–66), and nine NBA championships. With a total of 16 NBA championship rings in a span of 29 years (1957–86) as the Celtics coach, general manager, and team president, Auerbach is the most successful team official in NBA history. He is credited with creating several generations of championship Boston Celtics teams, including the first Celtics dynasty with <b>Bill</b> <b>Russell,</b> which won an NBA record eight titles in a row (1959–66). As Celtics general manager, he created championship-winning teams around Hall-of-Famers Dave Cowens in the 1970s and Larry Bird in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1956 NBA draft, Auerbach {{had already}} {{set his sights}} on {{defensive}} rebounding center <b>Bill</b> <b>Russell.</b> Via a draft-day trade that sent Macauley and rookie Cliff Hagan to the rival St. Louis Hawks, he acquired a center in Russell, who would go on {{to become one of the}} greatest basketball players of all time. In the same draft, Auerbach picked up forward Tom Heinsohn and guard K.C. Jones, also two future Hall-of-Famers. Emphasizing team play rather than individual performances, and stressing that defense was more important than offense, Auerbach drilled his players to play tough defense and force opposing turnovers for easy fast-break points. Forward Tom Sanders recalled that the teams were also regularly among the best-conditioned and toughest squads.|$|E
50|$|Song-cycle {{musical theater}} works are {{becoming}} extremely popular among both composers and {{fans of the}} genre. One of the earliest was December Songs, created by Maury Yeston, and commissioned by Carnegie Hall for its Centennial celebration. They have been translated and performed in both French and German. Other examples include Songs for a New World by Jason Robert Brown, William Finn's Elegies, <b>Bill</b> <b>Russell's</b> Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens, and Myths and Hymns by Adam Guettel.|$|R
50|$|The Boston Celtics faced {{surprising}} criticism this year, but won 54 {{games in}} <b>Bill</b> <b>Russell's</b> second season as player/coach. The 6' 10 225-pound 33-year-old led his team again from his center spot, ranking third in rebounds and shots blocked and quietly finishing tenth in NBA in assists just behind teammate John Havlicek. Havlicek played more guard than forward {{this year and}} was an all-star with his strong all-around game. He {{was one of three}} 20-point scorers along with Sam Jones and Bailey Howell. Seven Celtics averaged ten points.|$|R
50|$|Those {{expecting a}} close {{series in the}} East or another Philadelphia fold were stunned to see a five-game series {{completely}} dominated by the 76ers. Winning the first three in clear numbers, the Sixers brought Boston back to their home court so they could bash the Celtics 140-116 and send them home. <b>Bill</b> <b>Russell's</b> first season as coach was a disappointment only in comparison to Auerbach's towering achievements before him. Chamberlain turned down the victory champagne from that celebrated win, saying there was still one more series to win.|$|R
5|$|Before the 1956–57 NBA season, Auerbach {{acquired}} two future Hall-of-Famers: forward Tom Heinsohn, {{and defensive}} center <b>Bill</b> <b>Russell.</b> Powered by these new recruits, the Celtics went 44–28 {{in the regular}} season, and Cousy averaged 20.6 points, 4.8 rebounds and a league-leading 7.5 assists, earning his first NBA Most Valuable Player Award; he also won his second NBA All-Star Game MVP award. The Celtics reached the 1957 NBA Finals, and powered by Cousy on offense and rugged center Russell on defense, they beat the Hawks 4–3, who were noted for future Hall-of-Fame power forward Bob Pettit and former teammates Macauley and Hagan. Cousy finally won his first title.|$|E
5|$|Russell {{is one of}} {{only seven}} players in history to win an NCAA Championship, an NBA Championship, and an Olympic gold medal. He was {{inducted}} into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. He was selected into the NBA 25th Anniversary Team in 1971 and the NBA 35th Anniversary Team in 1980, and named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996, one of only four players to receive all three honors. In 2007, he was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame. In Russell's honor the NBA renamed the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player trophy in 2009: it is now the <b>Bill</b> <b>Russell</b> NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.|$|E
5|$|West {{made himself}} {{available}} for the 1960 NBA draft, and he was drafted in the 2nd overall pick by the Minneapolis Lakers, shortly before the team relocated to Los Angeles. West became the first draft pick ever of the relocated franchise. His college coach was also hired to coach the Lakers. He played West as a guard, in contrast to West's college days as a forward. The Lakers were captained by Hall-of-Fame forward Elgin Baylor, who was complemented by centers Jim Krebs and Ray Felix; forwards Rudy LaRusso and Tom Hawkins; and guards Rod Hundley (from West Virginia, like West), Frank Selvy, and Bob Leonard. This team perennially had strong forwards and guards, but was constantly weak at center, giving them a disadvantage against the Boston Celtics with their Hall-of-Fame center, <b>Bill</b> <b>Russell.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Higgins' {{record as}} a general manager, like his {{managing}} record, was mediocre. During the 1960 offseason, he traded 6 ft 6½ -in (1.99 m) starting pitcher Frank Sullivan to the Philadelphia Phillies for another tall right-hander, 6 ft Gene Conley, who was also <b>Bill</b> <b>Russell's</b> backup center for the Boston Celtics; Conley would give Higgins two healthy seasons and win 15 games in [...] But apart from swapping shortstops with Paul Richards' Houston Colt [...]45s, acquiring Eddie Bressoud for Don Buddin, Higgins made no significant trades during {{the remainder of his}} two-year (1961-62) tenure as both manager and supervisor of playing personnel.|$|R
50|$|After {{his senior}} season at SMU, Krebs was {{selected}} by the Minneapolis Lakers with the third overall pick in the 1957 NBA draft. He played with the Lakers (who moved to Los Angeles in 1960) for seven seasons, mostly in a reserve role behind Vern Mikkelsen, Larry Foust or Rudy LaRusso. The team reached the NBA Finals three times (1959, 1962 and 1963), but lost each series to <b>Bill</b> <b>Russell's</b> Boston Celtics. Over his career, Krebs posted statistics of 8.0 points per game, 6.2 rebounds per game and 0.8 assists per game. His statistically strongest season occurred in 1961-62, when he averaged 10.0 points and 7.9 rebounds.|$|R
5000|$|Bellamy had {{a stellar}} 14-year {{career in the}} NBA, and was the NBA first overall draft pick in 1961. Bellamy was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in 1962 after having arguably {{one of the three}} {{greatest}} rookie seasons in NBA history (along with Wilt Chamberlain and Oscar Robertson). His 31.6 points per game average that season is second all-time for a rookie to Wilt Chamberlain's 37.6, and the 19 rebounds per game he averaged that season is the third-best all-time rookie mark (to Chamberlain's 27 and <b>Bill</b> <b>Russell's</b> 19.6). No NBA rookie has since surpassed Bellamy's 973 field goals during the 1961-62 season.|$|R
