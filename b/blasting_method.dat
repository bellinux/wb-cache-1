30|$|Surface {{coal mining}} in WV faces many {{challenges}}. These challenges include more restrictive regulations, a negative public perception, and difficult geological formations. Current <b>blasting</b> <b>methods,</b> if not properly designed and conducted, can create hazards like flyrock, toxic fumes, dust, ground vibration, and surface vibration created by air-blast. <b>Blasting</b> <b>methods</b> have been refined and are {{performed in a}} safer manner but the hazards still remain. Additionally, acid mine drainage may be generated if the rock is not properly identified and segregated. Although these hazards do not occur with every blast, it may only take a few incidents to tarnish {{the reputation of the}} entire industry. Exploring and applying alternative safe and environmentally friendly technology provides the potential to minimize if not eliminate these hazards.|$|R
50|$|An {{exploration}} tunnel near Sigirino was excavated between 1999 and 2003 to gain geological data on {{the rock}} formations at the CBT's level. Based on those data, {{it was decided to}} only drill a small part using a tunnel boring machine while the rest was excavated with traditional <b>blasting</b> <b>methods.</b>|$|R
500|$|Construction of {{the tunnel}} was done by {{drilling}} and blasting. During planning, use of a tunnel boring machine was considered, but the conventional drilling and <b>blasting</b> <b>method</b> was chosen because it was both cheaper and faster. At Hommelvik, the new section of track starts at the river of Homla, where it will run in a curve towards the tunnel entrance at Solbakken. Just within the entrance, there will be built a pool and pump to collect surface water. A crosscut is located at Muruvik, close to the quarry. At this point it is [...] to the tunnel and blasting will be performed in both directions from the tunnel's interception with the crosscut. Muruvik will also serve as the operational hub; transport of the masses to the airport will run along the old E6. The third point of entry for blasting is the entrance at Hell. The works include replacing the level crossing at Hell Station with an overpass.|$|E
500|$|There {{were four}} main {{contracts}} for building the line issued after public tenders. Three of these involved {{part of the}} tunnel, and were awarded to Skanska, Veidekke and NCC.

50|$|Bristle blasting, {{unlike other}} <b>blasting</b> <b>methods,</b> {{does not require}} a {{separate}} blast media.

500|$|The Bømlafjord Tunnel (...) is a subsea {{road tunnel}} under Bømlafjorden which connects {{the island of}} Føyno in Stord to the {{mainland}} at Dalshovda in Sveio, Norway. The tunnel is [...] long and reaches [...] below mean sea level. It carries three lanes of European Road E39 and {{is part of the}} Triangle Link, a fixed link which connects Sunnhordland to Haugaland. Plans for the tunnel arose in the 1980s; construction started in 1997 and the tunnel opened on 27 December 2000. The tunnel was built using the drilling and <b>blasting</b> <b>method,</b> with two teams building from each end. The tunnel runs through an area composed mostly of gneiss, phyllite and greenstone. The tunnel is the longest subsea tunnel in Norway and was the second-deepest in the world until 2008. It is still (2013) the deepest point on the E-road network. The tunnel was a toll road from the opening until 30. April 2013. In 2012 the tunnel had an average 4,084 vehicles per day.|$|E
500|$|Work on {{geological}} {{surveys in}} the area started prior to 2001, with surveys being performed by the Geological Survey of Norway. The contract to build the tunnel and all other earthwork on the section from Solstad to Hønsveien was awarded to Mika, with the tunneling costing NOK425 million. The tunnel was built using the drilling and <b>blasting</b> <b>method</b> using two points of entry, the entrance on the Asker side and from a crosscut at Skaugum. Work started in February 2002 and was concluded in May 2005. Construction involved blasting [...] of earthwork [...] and drilling [...] of holes for pre-injection. The construction used [...] of gunite, [...] of concrete, 24,000 bolts, [...] of water- and frost protection, [...] of noise- and frost isolation and [...] of cable conduit. Near the entrance at Asker, the tunnel is closest to the surface, and is between [...] below the basements of residential houses. During the construction of this part, the construction was as slow as [...] per week, of which half the time was used for injections to choke the tunnel.|$|E
500|$|Geological {{sampling}} {{was undertaken}} by the Norwegian Geological Survey and Grøner, and included both core samples and reflection seismology. Late core samples showed that the tunnel {{would have to be}} located [...] further down than originally planned to avoid deposits. The tunnel construction was awarded to two companies: the contract starting from Dalshovda in Sveio and was worked by the Public Roads Administration, while the tunneling from Føyno was worked by NCC. Both used the drilling and <b>blasting</b> <b>method.</b> NCC was awarded the contract after bidding NOK175 million for the job. Construction from Sveio started on 16 September 1997 and from Føyno on 6 March 1998. In all, [...] of earthwork was extracted. The earthwork from the Føyno side was transported by barge to Austevoll and used to build the Austevoll Bridge. The earthwork from the Sveio side was used to build roads and a golf course in the area. On average, the tunnel was built at a speed of [...] per week, with the record being [...] Between 30 and 40 people worked with the tunneling on each team. The lowest point was reached on 5 May 1999 and the breakthrough took place on 2 September 1999, five months before schedule. Construction involved injection of [...] and spraying of [...] of gunite.|$|E
25|$|Work at {{the western}} end of the tunnel {{continued}} with traditional drill and <b>blast</b> <b>methods.</b> The profile of the western end, which had been round to accommodate the TBM, was changed to a horseshoe shape to better suit conventional tunnelling procedure.

30|$|The fungus T. harzianum/Hypocrealixii TSK 8 (JQ 809340) {{isolated}} from mangroves {{was used for}} this experiment. The identity of the fungal strain was confirmed based on 18 S rRNA sequence in comparison with that available in NCBI database by using <b>BLAST</b> <b>methods.</b> This strain was stored on potato dextrose agar (PDA) slants at 4 °C for the further experiments (Saravanakumar et al. 2013).|$|R

50|$|Vacuum {{blasting}} is an abrasive <b>blasting</b> <b>method,</b> {{also referred}} to as dustless blasting or closed loop abrasive blasting. The method is characterized by a blast tool that does abrasive blasting and collects both used blast media, and loosened particles from the surface to be treated, simultaneously. The blast tool is equipped with a blast hose and a suction hose, that both run from the blast tool to a control unit. The control unit supplies the blast tool with pressurized air mixed with blast media, and sucks back dust, loosened particles and used blast media. The control unit continuously separates dust and loosened particles from the used blast media, and sends used blast media back into the pressurized air flow. The dust and loosened particles are collected in a waste bin.|$|E
5000|$|Tunnel boring {{machines}} {{are used as}} an alternative to drilling and <b>blasting</b> (D&B) <b>methods</b> in rock and conventional [...] "hand mining" [...] in soil. TBMs have the advantages of limiting the disturbance to the surrounding ground and producing a smooth tunnel wall. This significantly reduces the cost of lining the tunnel, and makes them suitable to use in heavily urbanized areas. The major disadvantage is the upfront cost. TBMs are expensive to construct, and can be difficult to transport. The longer the tunnel, the less the relative cost of tunnel {{boring machines}} versus drill and <b>blast</b> <b>methods.</b> This is because tunneling with TBMs is much more efficient and results in shortened completion times, assuming they operate successfully.|$|R
30|$|The {{drill and}} <b>blast</b> <b>method</b> is widely adopted in tunnel {{construction}} of high-speed railways. Therefore, improving {{the air quality}} in tunnels is critical to keeping a good working environment in tunnels, especially for a long tunnel with a high gas content. The traditional ventilation is to dilute harmful gas and dust. However, {{it is found that}} using ventilation only is not effective or costs a lot of electricity [10].|$|R
50|$|All {{tunnels and}} {{underground}} caverns were excavated using drill and <b>blast</b> <b>method</b> {{except for the}} diversion tunnels which utilised a 3m-diameter tunnel boring machine.
