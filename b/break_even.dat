5|$|In 2010, {{the airline}} transported 14,000 people {{and had a}} revenue of NOK17 million, {{allowing}} Krohn Air to <b>break</b> <b>even.</b> On 14 February 2011, the company increased the service from Molde to Trondheim from two to four daily services in each direction, from Monday through Thursday. From 2010 to 2012 the airline had an accumulated loss of NOK3.3 million. This later was reduced back to a typical twice-daily schedule. A twice-daily route from Ålesund to Trondheim was introduced on 3 March 2013. The Ålesund service was terminated on 13 September 2013, with Krohn stating that they were lacking two to three passengers per flight to <b>break</b> <b>even.</b> The company had a revenue of NOK19 million in 2013. Krohn Air ceased all operations on 4 February 2014, and filed for bankruptcy the following day. Widerøe commenced flights on the Molde–Trondheim route from 1 September 2014.|$|E
5|$|In December 1999 Warner Music Group, {{which owns}} Atlantic Records, stated they {{expected}} to sell at least five to six million copies of Shades of Purple. Sales had exceeded one million by September 2000, though investors were disappointed as they had not yet recuperated the amount they had spent promoting the duo; {{they expected to}} <b>break</b> <b>even</b> {{before the end of}} the year. The album sold 107,000 units in its opening week in the US, and had sold 268,000 units there by March 2002. Worldwide sales of the album exceeded 1.5 million by January 2002.|$|E

5|$|The second {{leg of the}} tour, {{comprising}} 25 arena {{shows in}} Europe from May to June 1992, was announced on 30 April. Ticketing details were kept secret until radio advertisements announced that tickets had gone on sale at box offices. In many cases, tickets were limited to two-per-person to deter scalping. Due to the production costs and relatively small arena crowds, the European arena leg lost money. McGuinness had planned larger outdoor concerts in Berlin, Turin, Poland, and Vienna to help the tour <b>break</b> <b>even,</b> but only the Vienna concert occurred.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} hand, Lady Fingers {{questioned}} Howard {{how he could}} have made that $1000 raise, to which Howard replied that poker was all about making the wrong move at the right time. On third street, the Kid bet $1000 into a $1000 pot {{with a pair of}} 10s shows while Howard had just a Queen high. By raising $1000, Howard was possibly representing a Queen in the hole and trying to buy the pot at the point. The Kid only had to put in another $1000 into a $4000, so he was offered 4 to 1 odds, which were very favorable odds, since he only had to be right 1 in 5 times to <b>break</b> <b>even.</b> Howard seemed to be relying on implied odds to justify that raise as well as the $3000 call on fourth street.|$|E

Jack's rival, Devon Banks (Will Arnett), complicates the situation by threatening to publicly ridicule Jack if the show loses money. Jack, under pressure, begins to interfere with Liz's appearance, sending her over the edge with insecurity. After 510 takes, they finally settle on an opening title to the show. After Liz locks herself in her dressing room, Jack shuts Dealbreakers down, but manages to <b>break</b> <b>even</b> by selling the show's opening titles; in future, whenever a television show is playing in the background of a Sheinhardt Universals soap opera, the Dealbreakers titles will be shown.|$|E
5|$|The 1999–00 {{season was}} the club's final {{year at the}} Ice Stadium {{before moving to the}} National Ice Centre. The budget for players was limited by the club {{chairman}} so that the Panthers would be able to <b>break</b> <b>even</b> the following season. Players were asked to take a wage cut, leading to the departure of Trevor Robins, Mike Bishop, Mark Kolesar, Eric Dubios and record goalscorer Paul Adey. This frustrated Mike Blaisdell who left the club in November to become head coach of the Sheffield Steelers. He was replaced by former coach Alex Dampier. Lacking the spending power of many of their rivals, Nottingham finished sixth in the eight team league. The club fared better in the Challenge Cup where it made the final for the second successive year but the team was defeated 2–1 at London Arena by Mike Blaisdell's Steelers. On 22 March 2000 the Panthers hosted Newcastle in their final game at the Ice Stadium. Jamie Leach scored Nottingham's last goal at their home of 54 years but the club was defeated 2–1 in overtime.|$|E
5|$|The steel {{structure}} was 51 metres (167 feet) tall (doubling {{the size of}} the stadium set for The Rolling Stones' A Bigger Bang Tour, the previous record holder), was able to hold up to 200 tonnes underneath it, and required 120trucks to transport each of the three sets constructed to support the tour. Each leg of the structure contained its own sound system. The cost of each structure was between £15million and £20million ($23 million and $31 million, respectively). As a result, the tour was heavily insured. The size of the stage led to some problems with its construction in certain venues. The band paid $2million to raise the HD video screen in Cowboys Stadium for their concert in Arlington, and paid $3million to expand the Hippodrome de Montréal into a temporary stadium for their concert in Montreal. The 360° tour crew consisted of 137 touring production crew supplemented by over 120 hired locally. Daily costs of the production were approximately $750,000, not including the stage construction; the majority of this came from truck rentals, transportation, and staff wages. The tour was not expected to <b>break</b> <b>even</b> until the conclusion of the second leg.|$|E

5|$|O'Sullivan {{began the}} 2010/2011 season at Event 1 of the Players Tour Championship, where he lost 0–4 in the quarter-finals against Jamie Cope. O'Sullivan next competed at Event 4, where {{he reached the}} final, but he lost 3–4 against Barry Pinches. At the World Open O'Sullivan made his record 10th maximum break in the last frame of his match against Mark King, which he won 3–0. However, {{he had to be}} persuaded by referee Jan Verhaas to play the final black, as he had become aware that there was no {{distinct}} prize money for a maximum break in the tournament, but only a prize of £4,000 for the highest <b>break.</b> <b>Even</b> then, he played the final black in a nonchalant fashion. O'Sullivan then defeated Jimmy White (3–1), Stephen Hendry (3–1), Stephen Maguire (3–1) and Peter Ebdon (3–1) to reach the final, where he lost 1–5 against Neil Robertson. O'Sullivan participated at the Premier League Snooker, and qualified for the finals unbeaten. He then defeated Neil Robertson 5–1 in the semi-finals, and Shaun Murphy 7–1 in the final, to claim his ninth Premier League Snooker title in 14 years. In the UK Championship in December, O'Sullivan suffered an early exit, losing 6–9 against Stuart Bingham in the first round.|$|E
5|$|Walsh {{identified}} drinks as {{the central}} Diageo business, and began selling off assets that did not fit this model. He sold Pillsbury to General Mills in 2001 for $10.1 billion, and Burger King to the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in 2002 for $1.5 billion. He suggested {{that he would have}} liked to have sold Burger King earlier, but was worried about Diageo's capacity to handle both transactions simultaneously. In a strategy to bolster Diageo's drinks sales, in 2001 he acquired the Seagram drinks business from Vivendi Universal in conjunction with Pernod Ricard for $8.2 billion, an action that was later credited with refocusing and re-energising Diageo. At the time, analysts suggested that Walsh had overpaid, and that Pernod Ricard had gained control of the better brands. Despite having entered into an alliance with Pernod in order to avoid regulatory issues, Diageo was still forced to divest the Malibu Rum brand after acquiring Captain Morgan. Walsh defended the deal on the basis of efficiency savings and the fact that the deal was almost entirely financed by the sale of Pillsbury. Of the acquisition he says:We moved in on that Seagram deal and forced their hand very quickly while our competitors were still trying to get their act together. If you look at what we paid it will go down in history as the bargain of the century. It was an $8.1bn total price of which our part was about $5.6bn and it was at economic profit <b>break</b> <b>even</b> at the end of year two. It’s produced phenomenal returns. If you look at Pernod’s Allied Domecq acquisition, it is 30 per cent higher in multiple terms and you’re not getting as good a collection of brands.|$|E
