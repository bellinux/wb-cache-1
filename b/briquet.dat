25|$|A {{charcoal}} briquette, or <b>briquet</b> is a {{block of}} flammable charcoal matter which is used as fuel to start and maintain a fire, mainly used for food preparation over an open fire or a barbecue. Charcoal briquettes are made by using a process which consists of compressing charcoal, typically made from sawdust and other wood by-products, with a binder and other additives. The binder is usually starch. Some charcoal briquettes may also include brown coal, mineral carbon, borax, sodium nitrate, limestone, raw sawdust, and other additives like paraffin or petroleum solvents to aid in ignition. The design of the charcoal briquette was invented and patented by Ellsworth B. A. Zwoyer in 1897.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To help {{clarify the}} complex {{association}} between childhood abuse and adult psychopathology, the authors {{examined the relationship}} among abuse, <b>Briquet’s</b> syndrome (somatization disorder), and dissociative symptoms. Method: Ninety-nine female psychiatric clinic outpatients with a history ofsomatic complaints were assessed for <b>Briquet’s</b> syndrome, dissociative symptoms, adult and childhood sexualabuse, childhood physicalabuse, and child-hood emotionalabuse. Results: Women with high dissociation scores and many somatic symp-toms {{were more likely to}} report abuse than were subjects with low dissociation scores or with f ew somatic complaints. Conclusions: <b>Briquet’s</b> syndrome, dissociation, and abuse are signifi-cantly associated. Awareness ofthis association may have a significant effect on the treatment ofpsychiatric patients.
