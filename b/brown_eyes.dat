5|$|Lemurs {{and humans}} are both {{primates}}. Ancestral primates had <b>brown</b> <b>eyes,</b> as most primates do today. The genetic basis of blue eyes in humans {{has been studied}} in detail and much is known about it. It {{is not the case}} that one gene locus is responsible, say with brown dominant to blue eye color. However, a single locus is responsible for about 80% of the variation. In lemurs, the difference(s) between blue and <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> are not completely known, but the same gene locus is not involved.|$|E
5|$|The soft coat is reddish to golden brown, {{in sharp}} {{contrast}} with the white ventral parts. A brown band runs across the chest, and a distinct rufous collar can be observed on the neck. The chin and the medial surfaces of the legs are also white. The face is characterised by large, round dark <b>brown</b> <b>eyes,</b> small translucent ears, a slim muzzle, and a large grayish pink rhinarium.|$|E
5|$|According to the U.S. Department of State and the DEA, Antonio Ezequiel was 6ft (1.83 m) tall, {{and weighed}} {{approximately}} 215lbs (97.5 kilos). He had an alternative {{date of birth}} on 5 May 1962. He had black-colored hair and <b>brown</b> <b>eyes,</b> and his aliases were Marcos Ledezma, El Licenciado (The Certified or The Lawyer), and Tony Tormenta (Tony the Storm), which he earned for his explosive personality and for beheading and torturing his rivals.|$|E

5|$|Her {{green eyes}} {{were meant to}} symbolize nature and also served as another {{contrast}} to Tifa's <b>brown</b> <b>eyes.</b> Nomura did not change much of Aerith's design for Advent Children, but her design was updated in Kingdom Hearts with the removal of her bolero jacket, which made her attire appear more as Amano had originally drawn her. Other changes included the addition of bracelets and a belt. Nomura modified her dress in Before Crisis, adding white and green colors, and this version was also {{used as the basis}} for her design in Kingdom Hearts II.|$|E
5|$|Lara Croft is {{depicted}} as an athletic and fast woman with <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> and reddish-brown hair, frequently kept in a plait or ponytail. The character's classic costume is a turquoise tank top, light brown shorts, calf-high boots, and tall white socks. Accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a utility belt with holsters on either side, and two pistols. The video game sequels introduced new outfits designed for different environments, such as underwater and cold weather. In the later games, Croft wears a crop top, camouflage pants and black or light brown shirts. When exploring, she often carries two pistols, but has used other weaponry throughout the series. She is fluent in several languages.|$|E
5|$|The red-capped robin (Petroica goodenovii) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird {{native to}} Australia. Found in drier regions {{across much of the}} continent, it inhabits scrub and open woodland. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family Petroicidae, it is sexually dimorphic. Measuring 10.5–12.5cm (4–5in) in length, the robin has a small thin black bill, and dark <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to advertise territories and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.|$|E

5|$|The {{smallest}} of the red robins, the red-capped robin is 10.5–12.5cm (4–5in) long with a wingspan of 15–19.5cm (6–8in), and weighs around 7–9g (0.25–0.31oz). Males and females are of similar size. It has longer legs than the other robins of the genus Petroica. The male has a distinctive scarlet cap and breast. Its upperparts are jet black with white shoulder bars, and its tail black with white tips. The underparts and shoulder are white. All colours are sharply delineated from one another. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown above with a reddish tint to the crown, and paler underneath with dark brown wings and pale buff wing patch. Some females have a reddish tint to the breast. Both sexes have a small black bill, and dark <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> and legs. Immature birds initially resemble the female; it is only with their second moult, which takes place at around or {{just over a year}} of age that males adopt their distinctive adult plumage. The red-capped robin moults once a year, after the breeding season which takes place between December and April.|$|E

5000|$|Light-colored dachshunds can sport amber, light brown, {{or green}} eyes; however, kennel club {{standards}} {{state that the}} darker the eye color, the better. They can also have eyes of two different colors; however, this is only found in dapple and double dapple dachshunds. Dachshunds can have a blue and a <b>brown</b> <b>eye.</b> Blue eyes, partially blue eyes, or a blue <b>eye</b> and a <b>brown</b> <b>eye</b> are called [...] "wall" [...] coloring, and are considered a non-desirable trait in kennel club standards. Dappled eyes are also possible.|$|R

25|$|Tapirs have <b>brown</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{often with}} a bluish cast to them, which has been {{identified}} as corneal cloudiness, a condition most commonly found in Malayan tapirs. The exact etiology is unknown, but the cloudiness may be caused by excessive exposure to light or by trauma. However, the tapir's sensitive ears and strong sense of smell help to compensate for deficiencies in vision.|$|E
25|$|Stanley Stanger was an {{investment}} broker when he volunteered in Toronto for the Canadian Expeditionary Force on 21 March 1916.

25|$|She was {{estimated}} to be between 20 and 28 years old and had been raped. Basic physical examination showed she was about 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighed about 118 pounds. The victim was white with possible Hispanic ancestry, as she had brown or black hair and <b>brown</b> <b>eyes.</b> She also had a unique scar {{on the back of her}} left hand, which was shaped like the letter T. She also had an inch-long scar on the back of her left thigh.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of Taboada, all {{of the victims were}} petite Caucasian brunettes with <b>brown</b> <b>eyes.</b> Although law enforcement authorities initially had very few leads, police did identify two suspects; one a University of Florida student who had a history of mental illness and bore numerous scars on his face from a car accident, making him an ideal image when discussing news about the investigation. His photo was shown repeatedly by media outlets. Authorities publicly cleared Humphrey of all charges after Rolling's arrest. The other suspect was also later cleared.|$|E
25|$|The {{protagonist of}} the two first instalments, Kim Kimberley, is a tall, athletic, {{intelligent}} woman with <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> and fair hair. She {{was born and raised}} at Hampstead Crèche, which was closed when she was thirteen years old due to violations of the Android Protection Acts. She finished her education at the Milton Keynes School of Life in Malta, then returned to England for National Service. She started doing standard security work with the occasional surveillance of subversive members of society, but ended working as a counter-espionage agent. Whilst in her mid-twenties, Kim accepted to travel undercover on the Snowball 9 to be there as the last resort for the worst-case scenario.|$|E

25|$|Marjorie Barnard met Flora Eldershaw, {{who was a}} {{year ahead}} of her, in her first year at the University of Sydney. Marjorie Barnard wrote of their first meeting as being ot entirely happy. I was the greenest of green 'freshers'. Flora was {{established}} in her second year. Chance had given me the locker immediately above hers. Its untidy contents frequently spilled out into her more ordered domain. My then meager person was continually underfoot, and Flora's <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> flashed with indignation more often than they smiled. But within the year we were close friends. She widened my horizons and quickened my mind. Later this friendship was to withstand what everyone agrees to be the acid test of collaboration in writing.|$|E
25|$|The immune system's HLA alleles {{have drawn}} {{particular}} {{attention in the}} attempt to identify genes that may derive from archaic human populations. Although not present in the sequenced Denisova genome, the distribution pattern and divergence of HLA-B*73 from other HLA alleles has led to the suggestion that it introgressed from Denisovans into humans in west Asia. As of 2011, half of the HLA alleles of modern Eurasians represent archaic HLA haplotypes, and have been inferred to be of Denisovan or Neanderthal origin. The apparent over-representation of these alleles suggests a positive selective pressure for their retention in the human population. A higher quality Denisovan genome published in 2012 reveals variants of genes in humans that are associated with dark skin, brown hair and <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> – consistent with features found with Melanesians today.|$|E
25|$|Box turtles are North American turtles of {{the genus}} Terrapene. Although box turtles are superficially similar to {{tortoises}} in terrestrial habits and overall appearance, they are actually members of the American pond turtle family (Emydidae). The twelve taxa which are distinguished in the genus are distributed over four species. They are largely characterized by having a domed shell, which is hinged at the bottom, allowing the animal to close its shell tightly to escape predators. Box turtles have become popular pets, although their needs in captivity are complex. The females usually have yellowish, <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> and the males usually have red or orange eyes, but the most reliable manner to distinguish males from females {{is to examine the}} plastron: on males there is a concave area centered beneath the hinge.|$|E
