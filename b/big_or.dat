40|$|In this dissertation, {{we study}} the partial and generic {{uniqueness}} of block term tensor decompositions in signal processing. We present several conditions for generic uniqueness of tensor decompositions of multilinear rank (1, L 1, L 1), [...] ., (1, LR, LR) terms. Our proof {{is based on}} algebraic geometric methods. Mathematical preliminaries for this dissertation are multilinear algebra, and classical algebraic geometry. In geometric language, we prove that the joins of relevant subspace varieties are not tangentially weakly defective. We also give conditions for partial uniqueness of block term tensor decompositions by proving that the joins of relevant subspace varieties are not defective. The main result is the following. For a tensor Y belong to the tensor product of three complex vector spaces of dimensions I, J, K, we assume that L 1, L 2, [...] ., LR is from small to large, K is <b>bigger</b> <b>or</b> equal to J, and J is strictly bigger than LR. If the dimension of ambient space is strictly less than IJK, then for general tensors among those admitting block term tensor decomposition, the block term tensor decomposition is partially unique {{under the condition that}} the binomial coefficient indexed by J and LR is <b>bigger</b> <b>or</b> equal to R, and I is <b>bigger</b> <b>or</b> equal to 2; it has infinitely many expressions under the condition IJK is strictly less than the sum from L_ 1 ^ 2 to L_R^ 2; it is essentially unique under any of the following there conditions: (i) I is <b>bigger</b> <b>or</b> equal to 2, J, K is <b>bigger</b> <b>or</b> equal to the sum from L 1 to LR (ii) R is 2, I is <b>bigger</b> <b>or</b> equal to 2 (iii) I is <b>bigger</b> <b>or</b> equal to R, K is <b>bigger</b> <b>or</b> equal to the sum from L 1 to LR, J is <b>bigger</b> <b>or</b> equal to 2 LR, the binomial coefficient indexed by J and LR is <b>bigger</b> <b>or</b> equal to R...|$|R

25|$|The Numerical Stroop effect {{demonstrates}} the {{close relationship between}} numerical values and physical sizes. Digits symbolize numerical values {{but they also have}} physical sizes. A digit can be presented as <b>big</b> <b>or</b> small (e.g., 5 vs. 5), irrespective of its numerical value. Comparing digits in incongruent trials (e.g., 3 5) is slower than comparing digits in congruent trials (e.g., 5 3) and the difference in reaction time is termed the numerical Stroop effect. The effect of irrelevant numerical values on physical comparisons (similar to the effect of irrelevant color words on responding to colors) suggests that numerical values are processed automatically (i.e., even when they are irrelevant to the task).|$|E

Hayes released the DFV initially to French team Matra, headed by Ken Tyrrell with Jackie Stewart as a driver. What followed was a golden age, where teams <b>big</b> <b>or</b> small could buy an engine which was competitive, light, compact, easy to work with and relatively cheap (£7,500 at 1967 prices or about £90,000 in 2005 money).

The lines have hooks which are baited, preferably with live bait. Caught tuna are swung on board, by two to three fishermen if the tuna is <b>big,</b> <b>or</b> with an automated swinging mechanism. The tuna usually release themselves from the barbless hook {{when they hit the}} deck. Tanks with live bait are placed round the decks, and water spray systems are used to attract the fish. The vessels are 15 to 45 metres o/a. On smaller vessels fishers fish from the main deck right around the boat. With larger vessels, there are two different deck styles: the American style and the Japanese style.|$|E
25|$|Considerable {{work has}} been {{published}} {{on the evolution of}} ant dulosis and almost all of it has at least some empirical evidence to defend its positions. Notably, that nearly all raiding ant species have is an adaptation of their mandibles that make them <b>big</b> <b>or</b> piercing or both. It makes sense that the very thing that enables an ant to be a better raider causes that same ant to become dependent on others; the parasite loses the use of its mandibles for actual work. On this and other evidence, it has been proposed that predation is the precursor to slavery. It has also been suggested that colony multiplication by adoption and budding followed by temporary parasitism can lead to dulosis. While observations indicate that colony multiplication can lead to temporary parasitism, it is apparently very questionable that temporary parasitism leads to dulosis.|$|E
25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1995-1996, a series of large storms {{exacerbated}} the ongoing deterioration of the wood structure. The 100-mph winds blew out 30,000 fogged white glass panes in the conservatory, shattered the white glass dome, and weakened the structure. In addition, 15 percent of the plant collection was lost due to exposure to the cold, wintry air and flying glass. After covering the holes with tarp and plywood and bringing in heaters, the conservatory contemplated farming out hundreds of plants to other institutions while the building was repaired. Some specimens however were too <b>big</b> <b>or</b> too old to move. The most challenging plant was the 112-year-old Brazilian philodendron that inhabited the shattered dome. A greenhouse was built to house the philodendron and other plants during renovation and afterwards used for expansion and keeping more exotic plants.|$|E

500|$|... "Go <b>Big</b> <b>or</b> Go Home", {{the third}} season premiere, {{was written by}} Alan Yang and {{directed}} by Dean Holland. It {{was the first to}} feature Adam Scott, Rob Lowe, Jim O'Heir and Retta as regular cast members rather than guest stars. Frequent guest performers Jama Williamson and Natalie Morales also reprised their roles. The episode was originally expected to debut in September 2010 and, due to Amy Poehler's pregnancy, the Parks and Recreation producers decided to write and film the first six episodes of the season early so it could meet that air date. However, to accommodate their new comedy series Outsourced, NBC opted not to put Parks and Recreation on the fall schedule, and instead delayed the third season premiere to a mid-season date of January 20, 2011. Due to the delay, [...] "Go <b>Big</b> <b>or</b> Go Home" [...] is set in the fall, when it was supposed to air, rather than the winter when it was actually broadcast. NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and Recreation, and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no negative effect on the show, but could actually build anticipation for its return.|$|E

500|$|... "Go <b>Big</b> <b>or</b> Go Home" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with several}} critics particularly complimenting the [...] "Swanson Pyramid of Greatness" [...] joke. HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall said the episode {{was effective in}} appealing to both new and old viewers, developing various character subplots and establishing the harvest festival story arc. He also praised the performances of Chris and Ann, which he called a far better and more interesting pairing than Ann with Mark Brendanawicz. Linda Holmes of NPR suggested the season premiere {{was a good place}} for newcomers to the series to start watching. She said all the characters were funny and the two new cast members had been seamlessly integrated into the show. Time magazine writer James Poniewozik called the episode an [...] "excellent start" [...] to the season, and said the harvest festival subplot would help better focus the series by giving the characters a single goal.

[...] The week of the third season premiere, Amy Poehler said of the hiatus, [...] "It was an NBC decision and certainly we were confused.
