40|$|RATIONALE: We have {{previously}} shown in healthy volunteers that an amino acid mixture lacking tyrosine and phenylalanine reduces tyrosine availability {{to the brain}} and produces cognitive and neuroendocrine effects consistent with reduced dopamine function. This could provide a potential nutritional approach to disorders such as mania and schizophrenia, which are characterised by overactivity of dopamine pathways. The amino acid mixture we tested previously is unpalatable, whereas mixtures containing only <b>branch</b> <b>chain</b> amino acids can be made more palatable. However, the effects of such mixtures on dopamine function in humans have not been studied. OBJECTIVE: To assess the tolerability of different doses of <b>branch</b> <b>chain</b> amino acids and to measure their effects on neuroendocrine and cognitive measures sensitive to changes in dopamine function. METHODS: We used a randomised, double-blind, cross-over design in 12 healthy volunteers to assess the effect of single oral doses of 10 g, 30 g and 60 g <b>branch</b> <b>chain</b> amino acids on plasma prolactin and a test of spatial recognition memory RESULTS: The <b>branch</b> <b>chain</b> amino acids were well tolerated. The availability of tyrosine for brain catecholamine synthesis decreased in a dose-related manner. As hypothesised, the drink increased both the plasma prolactin and the latency to respond on the spatial recognition memory task.

40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} are essential as flavor producers of cheese and fermented products. They {{are capable of}} catabolizing aromatic, <b>branched</b> <b>chain,</b> and sulfur amino acids to flavor compounds. During cheese ripening the numbers of lactococcal colonies decrease, but lactococci survive without replication in culture. This prompted an investigation into possible mechanisms of catabolism of <b>branched</b> <b>chain</b> amino acids into <b>branched</b> <b>chain</b> fatty acids and the physiological relevance of amino acid catabolism to the bacteria. We hypothesized that lactococci catabolize <b>branched</b> <b>chain</b> amino acids to <b>branched</b> <b>chain</b> fatty acids during nonculturability. Lactococci, lactobacilli, and brevibacteria catabolized both <b>branched</b> <b>chain</b> amino acids and keto acids into <b>branched</b> <b>chain</b> fatty acids. Lactococci survived carbohydrate-limited conditions for over 4 yrs. Their survival was represented by maintaining intracellular ATP, enzyme activity, membrane integrity, capability of ATP- and PMF-dependent substrate transport, transcription, and catabolism of amino acids to fatty acids. Assays conducted with NMR spectroscopy coupled with in silico analysis showed that <b>branched</b> <b>chain</b> substrates are catabolized via keto acids, HMG-CoA, and acetyl-CoA to <b>branched</b> <b>chain</b> fatty acids. A short list of candidate genes was identified for the pathway by gene expression analysis coupled to NMR analysis. The expression of these genes {{and the presence of}} the related catabolites were identified in long-term starved cultures of nonculturable lactococci. This verified that catabolism of <b>branched</b> <b>chain</b> amino acids to <b>branched</b> <b>chain</b> fatty acids occurred during the nonculturable state only and in conditions of carbohydrate deprivation. The pathway also facilitated fixation of carbon by lactococci, revealing the mechanism of survival of lactococci over 4 yrs in culture without the addition of external carbon sources. Between strains the availability of carbohydrate and acid stress played significant roles in modulating their ability to produce <b>branched</b> <b>chain</b> catabolites. The ability of lactococci to catabolize <b>branched</b> <b>chain</b> amino acids during sugar starvation represents a shift in carbon catabolic routes. The identified pathway also represented a balance between catabolism and anabolism, suggesting that the bacteria were in a homeostatic state during nonculturability. We accepted the hypothesis that nonculturable lactococci catabolized <b>branched</b> <b>chain</b> amino acids to <b>branched</b> <b>chain</b> fatty acids during starvation. /p 3 ̆...|$|R

40|$|Background: The nuclear receptors {{peroxisome}} proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) play central {{roles in}} regulating metabolism in adipose tissue, {{as well as}} being targets for the treatment of insulin resistance. While the role of PPARγ in regulating insulin sensitivity has been well defined, research into PPARδ has been limited until recently due to a scarcity of selective PPARδ agonists. Results: The metabolic effects of PPARγ and PPARδ activation have been examined in vivo in white adipose tissue from ob/ob mice and in vitro in cultured 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes using 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry metabolomics to understand the receptors' contrasting roles. These steady state measurements were supplemented with 13 C-stable isotope substrate labeling to assess fluxes, in addition to respirometry and transcriptomic microarray analysis. The metabolic effects of the receptors were readily distinguished, with PPARγ activation characterized by increased fat storage, synthesis and elongation, while PPARδ activation caused increased fatty acid β-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle rate and oxidation of extracellular <b>branch</b> <b>chain</b> amino acids. Stimulated glycolysis and increased fatty acid desaturation were common pathways for the agonists. Conclusions: PPARγ and PPARδ restore insulin sensitivity through varying mechanisms. PPARδ activation increases total oxidative metabolism in white adipose tissue, a tissue not traditionally thought of as oxidative. However, the increased metabolism of <b>branch</b> <b>chain</b> amino acids may provide a mechanism for muscle atrophy, which has been linked to activation of this nuclear receptor. PPARδ has a role as an anti-obesity target and as an anti-diabetic, and hence may target both the cause and consequences of dyslipidemia. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristic}} {{amino acid}} pattern observed in chronic liver failure with high aromatic and low <b>branched</b> <b>chain</b> amino acid levels {{is considered to}} be consequent to increased muscle protein catabolism. The main catabolic stimulus has been attributed to hyperglucagonemia and to a reduced insulin/glucagon molar ratio. Intravenous administration of a solution containing <b>branched</b> <b>chain</b> amino acids and glucose to patients with chronic liver cirrhosis rapidly normalizes the plasma amino acid pattern. This effect may result from either a change in the insulin/glucagon ratio, induced by glucose, or from the anticatabolic influence of <b>branched</b> <b>chain</b> amino acids on muscle protein turnover. To discriminate between these two possibilities, a crossover study was carried out to determine the effect of a 24 -hour infusion of either glucose alone, or glucose plus <b>branched</b> <b>chain</b> amino acids, in seven patients with chronic liver failure.

Recent evidence demonstrates {{their roles in}} plant defense responses and root development. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), nitric oxide (NO), and cyclic GMP (cGMP) are essential messengers that participate in various plant physiological processes, but how these messengers modulate the plant response to N-acyl-homoserine-lactone signals remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the N- 3 -oxo-decanoyl-homoserine-lactone (3 -O-C 10 -HL), in contrast to its analog with an unsubstituted <b>branch</b> <b>chain</b> at the C 3 position, efficiently stimulated the formation of adventitious roots and the expression of auxin-response genes in explants of mung bean (Vigna radiata) seedlings. This response was mimicked by the exogenous application of auxin, H 2 O 2, NO, or cGMP homologs but suppressed by treatment with scavengers or inhibitors of H 2 O 2, NO, or cGMP metabolism. The 3 -O-C 10 -HL treatment enhanced auxin basipetal transport; this effect could be reversed by treatment with H 2 O 2 or NO scavengers but not by inhibitors of cGMP synthesis. Inhibiting 3 -O-C 10 -HL-induced H 2 O 2 or NO accumulation impaired auxin- or 3 -O-C 10 -HL-induced cGMP synthesis; however, blocking cGMP synthesis did not affect auxin- or 3 -O-C 10 -HL-induced H 2 O 2 or NO generation. Additionally, cGMP partially rescued the inhibitory effect of H 2 O 2 or NO scavengers on 3 -O-C 10 -HL-induced adventitious root development and auxin-response gene expression. These results suggest that 3 -O-C 10 -HL, unlike its analog with an unmodified <b>branch</b> <b>chain</b> at the C 3 position, can accelerate auxin-dependent adventitious root formation, possibly via H 2 O 2 - and NO-dependent cGMP signaling in mung bean seedlings...|$|E

Root starches also were debranched enzymically, and <b>branch</b> <b>chain</b> lengths were examined. Results indicate that, irrespective of starch concentration, starch from taproots of the high starch genotype was composed of approximately 80 % high molecular weight starch with I 2 -Kl absorbance characteristics similar to amylopectin. The remaining 20 % of the starch was low molecular weight with I 2 -Kl absorbance characteristics similar to amylose. Starches of the low starch genotype contained approximately 85 % high molecular weight polysaccharide at high root starch concentrations (> 50 grams per kilogram). At low root starch concentrations (< 10 grams per kilogram), starch from the low starch genotype had nearly equal proportions of low and high molecular weight polysaccharide. The I 2 -Kl absorbance properties of the low molecular weight starches from roots of the low starch genotype indicated that some branching may be present. The distribution of chain lengths from amylopectin did not change during starch degradation and reaccumulation for the high starch genotype. In the low starch genotype, the proportion of low molecular weight branches having a degree of polymerization between 1 and 30 was decreased at the very low starch concentrations observed on the 14 th day of regrowth.
