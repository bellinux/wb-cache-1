5|$|A bourdon or knobbed {{staff is}} shown behind {{the arms of}} some priors and prioresses {{as a symbol of}} office {{analogous}} to the crosier. Arms of priors from the 15th century had a banner surrounding the shield, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> this is often a rosary.|$|E
5|$|Sahlab is a {{drinkable}} pudding {{once made}} of the powdered bulb of the orchid plant <b>but</b> <b>today</b> usually made with cornstarch. It is usually sold in markets or by street vendors, especially in the winter. It is topped with cinnamon and chopped pistachios.|$|E
5|$|The {{molecular}} {{evidence suggests}} that the storm petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next, with the procellariids and diving petrels splitting most recently. Many taxonomists used to retain the diving petrels in this family also, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> their distinctiveness is considered well supported.|$|E
50|$|Block {{matching}} {{requires a}} staggering amount of processing horsepower, <b>but</b> <b>today's</b> microprocessors {{are making it}} a viable solution.|$|R
50|$|Animal fibres have {{traditionally}} been used to create rolags, <b>but</b> <b>today's</b> spinners use many different fibre materials, including manufactured and plant fibres.|$|R
50|$|Historical {{documents}} {{talk about}} a church dedicated to Saint Michael on Mount Čad, {{to the east of}} the island, <b>but</b> <b>today's</b> whereabouts of the church are unknown.|$|R
5|$|The {{monument}} {{has been}} repaired several times. Initially in 1777 {{and again in}} 1828 and then in 1879, each time the repairs were funded by Granville's descendants. Note that the original spelling was Bevil Granville <b>but</b> <b>today</b> Grenville or Greville are commonly used.|$|E
5|$|There are {{in total}} {{nineteen}} known ruined churches on the Swedish island of Gotland, in the Baltic Sea twelve of which lie in Visby, the island's main town. Of these, ten lie within the medieval city walls. Three additional church ruins in Visby are known through written sources, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> completely vanished.|$|E
5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{initially}} taken as postulates, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> there are efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption {{has been tested}} by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the fine structure constant {{over much of the}} age of the universe is of order 10−5. Also, general relativity has passed stringent tests on the scale of the Solar System and binary stars.|$|E
50|$|Urspelt Castle has {{a history}} going back at least three centuries <b>but</b> <b>today's</b> {{building}} dates from 1860. After comprehensive restoration work and additions, it recently opened as a hotel and meeting centre.|$|R
50|$|In the Islamic {{tradition}} Dhul Qarnayn {{has been}} identified with various historical, mythical, and sacred figures, with the most popular identification being with Alexander the Great; <b>but</b> <b>today's</b> consensus is that no exact identification could be made.|$|R
50|$|Another {{reason for}} change is to address safety issues. Everyone’s view {{of safety and}} {{liability}} {{has changed over the}} years. For example, thirty years ago goalkeepers did not wear helmets <b>but</b> <b>today’s</b> standards and personal expectations demand increased protection.|$|R
5|$|Those {{with few}} or no {{qualifications}} numbered 597 in 2001, while 328 had higher diplomas, degrees or further degrees. In contrast, about 53% of children aged 5–14 went to school in 1851, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> 58% of those aged 16–17 stay on at school.|$|E
5|$|Any {{extended}} ocean voyage without {{fresh water}} or food would prove {{difficult for a}} large, warm-blooded (homeothermic) mammal, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> many small, nocturnal species of lemur exhibit heterothermy, which allows them to lower their metabolism and become dormant while living off fat reserves. Such a trait in a small, nocturnal lemur ancestor would have facilitated the ocean voyage and could have been passed on to its descendants. However, this trait has not been observed in the closely related lorisoids studied to date, and could have evolved on Madagascar {{in response to the}} island's harsh environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|As Sicily now {{becomes a}} more {{politically}} stable, secure and less corrupt environment, the Baroque palazzi are slowly beginning {{to open their}} doors to an eager paying public, American and Northern European as much as Italian. In 1963, when the movie The Leopard was released the Gangi Palace ballroom was almost unique in its status of having been a film set, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> long unused salons and ballrooms are hosting corporate and public events. Some palazzi are offering a bed and breakfast service to paying guests, once again providing impressive hospitality to visitors to Sicily, the purpose {{for which they were}} originally intended.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} years, the cup was {{dominated}} mostly by BFC Viktoria 1889 (initially {{under the name}} BTuFC Viktoria 1889). They managed to win the cup 5 times. <b>But</b> <b>today's</b> Bundesliga side Hertha BSC Berlin were able to capture the trophy five times as well.|$|R
50|$|The main {{employers}} are the paper factory, part of Billerud. They mostly produce paper for bags, sacks and wallpaper. The factory was opened in 1872, <b>but</b> <b>today's</b> industry was {{built up in}} the 1960s. Many of the town's inhabitants commute to Norrköping and Finspång.|$|R
5000|$|Jiji (...) or Chichi is {{an urban}} {{township}} {{located in the}} west central portion of Nantou County, Taiwan. In the past, the Jiji township encompassed a much larger area and included the present-day Shueili Township, <b>but</b> <b>today's</b> Jiji is the smallest of Taiwan's townships by area.|$|R
5|$|In ancient times, the addax {{occurred}} from Northern Africa through Arabia and the Levant. Pictures in a tomb, {{dating back}} to the 2500 BCE show at least the partial domestication of the addax by the ancient Egyptians. These pictures show addax and some other antelopes tied with ropes to stakes. The number of addax captured by a person were considered an indicator of his high social and economic position in the society. <b>But</b> <b>today</b> excess poaching has resulted in the extinction of this species in Egypt since the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Navenby was {{originally}} an agricultural village, with most people {{living off the}} land or trading goods in the local market. Statistics show that, in 1841, 48% of villagers worked in agriculture, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> the majority of villagers, 67%, are employed in the service industry and most commute to work away from Navenby. The village does, however, offer limited work opportunities, with the High Street lined with shops, fast-food stores and public houses. A doctors' surgery, building society and residential care home are based in the village, although the post office closed in January 2011.|$|E
5|$|The Benjaminville Friends Meeting House {{is located}} on a {{relatively}} elevated area of land east of Bloomington, Illinois, near the community of Holder. The land was originally flat, treeless prairie <b>but</b> <b>today</b> is designated mostly for agricultural use. The unincorporated community of Bentown is located nearby as well. To the east a large wind farm is being constructed within Arrowsmith Township. The building is the last extant structure in the now-defunct village of Benjaminville, Illinois.|$|E
50|$|Football {{appears to}} have been played in and around Deniliquin as early as the 1870s, <b>but</b> <b>today's</b> Deniliquin Football Club was born some six decades later, in 1933. The club is based in the town of Deniliquin located in the Riverina {{district}} of New South Wales.|$|R
50|$|Haslev Church (Haslev Kirke) {{is located}} in the town of Haslev, Diocese of Roskilde, Faxe Municipality in Region Sjælland on the Danish island of Zealand. The oldest parts of the church were built in the 12th century <b>but</b> <b>today's</b> {{structure}} is the result of its rebuilding in 1916.|$|R
50|$|A {{few decades}} ago, Bacillus mesentericus (rope), {{was a serious}} problem, <b>but</b> <b>today's</b> {{improved}} sanitary practices in the bakery, combined with rapid turnover of the finished product, have virtually eliminated this form of spoilage. Calcium propanoate and sodium propanoate are effective against both B. mesentericus rope and mold.|$|R
5|$|The {{death of}} the pope is {{verified}} by the Cardinal Camerlengo, or Chamberlain, who traditionally performed the task by calling out his Christian (not papal) name {{three times in the}} presence of the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations, and of the Cleric Prelates, Secretary and Chancellor of the Apostolic Camera. The Cardinal Camerlengo takes possession of the Ring of the Fisherman worn by the pope; the ring, along with the papal seal, is later destroyed before the College of Cardinals. The tradition originated to avoid forgery of documents, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> merely is a symbol of the end of the pope's reign.|$|E
5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge. A water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 steps that runs down {{to the foot of}} the cliffs. In the 13th century, the sea came up close to the stairway, allowing resupply by sea, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> the sea has retreated significantly, making it more difficult to envisage the concept in its original setting.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, sales {{took place}} in the {{daffodil}} fields prior to harvesting the bulbs, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> sales are handled by Marketing Boards although still before harvesting. In the Netherlands there are special exhibition gardens for major buyers to view flowers and order bulbs, some larger ones may have more than a thousand narcissus varieties on display. While individuals can visit these gardens they cannot buy bulbs at retail, which are only available at wholesale, usually at a minimum of several hundredweight. The most famous display is at Keukenhof, although only about 100 narcissus varieties are on display there.|$|E
50|$|There is {{extensive}} {{ongoing debate}} on who exactly was the historical character of Dhul-Qarnayn, with various historical, mythical, and sacred figures being proposed. The most popular identification, especially by classical Quran commentators, {{has been with}} Alexander the Great; <b>but</b> <b>today's</b> consensus is that no exact identification could be made.|$|R
50|$|Kendo {{originated}} in Japan, <b>but</b> is <b>today</b> practiced worldwide.|$|R
40|$|Who {{would have}} thought that a lumbering {{performance}} by New Labour’s unloved Witchfinder General would trap the Golden Boy of British politics? I doubt that it was all a cunning ploy by Jack Straw, <b>but</b> <b>today’s</b> Prime Minister’s Questions witnessed a masterclass in snatching defeat from the jaws of victory by Nick Clegg...|$|R
5|$|A Greek {{force of}} {{approximately}} 7,000 men marched north {{to block the}} pass {{in the middle of}} 480 BC. The Persian army, alleged by the ancient sources to have numbered over one million, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> considered to have been much smaller (various figures are given by scholars, ranging between about 100,000 and 150,000), arrived at the pass in late August or early September. The vastly outnumbered Greeks held off the Persians for seven days (including three of battle) before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous last stands. During two full days of battle, the small force led by Leonidas blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could pass. After the second day, a local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks by revealing that a small path led behind the Greek lines. Leonidas, aware that his force was being outflanked, dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, and 400 Thebans, fighting to the death.|$|E
5|$|Banff National Park has a subarctic climate {{with three}} ecoregions, {{including}} montane, subalpine, and alpine. The forests {{are dominated by}} Lodgepole pine at lower elevations and Engelmann spruce in higher ones below the treeline, above which is primarily rocks and ice. Mammal species such as the grizzly, cougar, wolverine, elk, bighorn sheep and moose are found, along with hundreds of bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are also found but {{only a limited number}} of species have been recorded. The mountains are formed from sedimentary rocks which were pushed east over newer rock strata, between 80 and 55million years ago. Over the past few million years, glaciers have at times covered most of the park, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> are found only on the mountain slopes though they include the Columbia Icefield, the largest uninterrupted glacial mass in the Rockies. Erosion from water and ice have carved the mountains into their current shapes.|$|E
5|$|In May 1957, Eisenhower tasked the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) {{to provide}} {{a report on the}} {{potential}} effectiveness of fallout shelters and other means of protecting the US population {{in the event of a}} nuclear war. Chaired by Horace Rowan Gaither, the PSAC team completed their study in September, publishing it officially on 7 November as Deterrence & Survival in the Nuclear Age, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> known as the Gaither Report. After ascribing an expansionist policy to the USSR, along with suggestions that they were more heavily developing their military than the US, the Report suggested that there would be a significant gap in capability in the late 1950s due to spending levels.|$|E
50|$|Eriksholm Castle is a {{manor house}} {{located at the}} foot of the Isefjord inlet, 6 km {{south-east}} of Holbæk, in east Denmark. The history of the estate dates back to 1400 <b>but</b> <b>today's</b> house was built in 1788. It was designed by Caspar Frederik Harsdorff, the leading Danish architect of the time.|$|R
50|$|Derby of Tetovo - Tetovo's big derby match used to {{take place}} between FK Teteks, whose fans are working class, and FK Ljuboten, whose fans are the oldest {{citizens}} of Tetovo. <b>But</b> <b>today's</b> main rival of FK Teteks is Shkëndija (which means Iskra in Macedonian language), whose fans are predominantly of Albanian descent.|$|R
50|$|Sandbjerg is {{a former}} estate and manor house 5 km north of Sønderborg in the {{southeast}} of Jutland, Denmark. The estate dates from 1571, <b>but</b> <b>today's</b> house was built in 1788. Since 1959, the estate {{has been used by}} Aarhus University for teaching and research. Today it is the university's conference centre.|$|R
