40|$|Control {{system design}} {{problems}} are generally multi-objective since they require several, generally conflicting requirements to be simultaneously met. In order {{to consider all}} individual objectives different vectorized solution concepts have been proposed {{in the past in}} which the problem is expressed as a set of algebraic inequalities. In this paper a new concept based on the theory of Fuzzy Decision Making will be introduced. According to the natural <b>blurred</b> character <b>of</b> the <b>objectives</b> and the human way of evaluating control performance the individual target functions will be expressed by Fuzzy membership functions which are aggregated to a common performance index by logical AND connection. The proposed Fuzzy-concept has been successfully applied to the control design of a complex industrial batch process which is characterized by heavy stochastic disturbances and large sensor time delay. By the employment of the developed optimization concept the implementing time of new controllers has been reduced and the product quality has been considerably improved...|$|R

This {{is attractive to}} our vision of realtime multiparty collaboration from distributed places with video data at HD resolution that must guarantee maximum end-to-end delay of 11. 5 ms to enable musical synchronization. Based on the Distributed Multimedia Plays architecture, this paper compares the performances of bicubic and Lanczos techniques {{as well as one}} recently proposed for image upsampling in terms of computing time, level <b>of</b> <b>blur,</b> and <b>objective</b> image quality in PSNR and SSIM. The effects <b>of</b> image <b>blur</b> and edges to resampling are also examined. The results show that the classic Lanczos- 2 and bicubic techniques perform the best and thus are suitable for the vision due to their potential for efficient parallel processing in hardware. We also show that composite images with different downsampling factors can achieve 4 dB increase in PSNR. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of a rear view mirror is a determining factor in its shape - resulting in a flat rear mirrored face. The resulting bluff body generates unsteady base pressures which generate unsteady forces, leading to movement of the mirror surface and potential image <b>blurring.</b> The <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> this paper was to experimentally determine the fluctuating base pressure on a standard and modified mirror. Half a full-size vehicle was utilised, fixed to the side wall of a wind tunnel. A dynamically responsive multi channel pressure system was used to record the pressures. The modification to the mirror consisted {{of a series of}} extensions to the mirror rim, to see if this method would attenuate the fluctuating base pressures. It was found that increasing the length of the extension changed the pressure pattern across the face, and the over all magnitude of the fluctuations reduced with increasing length of extension. It was recommended to further the work via phase measurements...|$|R
