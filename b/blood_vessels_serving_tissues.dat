Study design: To reveal A, B and H antigens in tissue sections of patients with precancerous and cancerous oral lesions (n= 54) we used a modified specific red cell adherence technique (SRCA-test). Normal endothelial cells expressed ABH antigens, the presence of indicator erythrocytes at the lumen of the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>served</b> as a built in positive control. The test results were graded from negative adherence to very strongly positive adherence. Negative adherence was defined as a complete absence of adhered indicator erythrocytes. A strongly positive reaction was defined as a sheet of indicator erythrocytes adhered to the epithelia cells. Results: In 31 of the 54 samples analyzed the test showed slightly positive results on atypical areas, and there was a complete antigen deletion in areas histologically affected by neoplasia. Sixteen samples showed a total absence of ABH antigens in both histologically normal and pathological areas. As a working hypothesis, we propose that areas of SRCA-test negative epithelium are closely related to invasive carcinomas and may be their precursor lesions. Further it is suggested that areas of blood group isoantigen negative epithelium showing atypia, or in some instances near normal histology, may give rise to relatively low grade carcinomas.

Using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter, we isolated ECs from pooled tissues from the DA or the descending aorta of Wistar rat fetuses at full-term of gestation (F group) or neonates 30 minutes after birth (N group). Using anti-CD 31 and anti-CD 45 antibodies as cell surface markers for ECs and hematopoietic derived cells, respectively, cDNAs from the CD 31 -positive and CD 45 -negative cells were hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip® Rat Gene 1. 0 ST Array. Among 26, 469 gene-level probe sets, 82 genes in the F group and 81 genes in the N group were expressed at higher levels in DA ECs than in aortic ECs (p 2. 0). In addition to well-known endothelium-enriched genes such as Tgfb 2 and Vegfa, novel DA endothelium-dominant genes including Slc 38 a 1, Capn 6, and Lrat were discovered. Enrichment analysis using GeneGo MetaCore software showed that DA endothelium-related biological processes were involved in morphogenesis and development.

Methods and Results-—To date, no mouse models of coronary arterial growth have been described. Using a closed-chest model of myocardial ischemia, we have demonstrated that brief episodes of repetitive ischemia are sufficient to promote the growth of both large coronary arteries and the microvasculature. Induction of large coronary artery and microvascular growth resulted in improvements in myocardial perfusion after prolonged ischemia and protected from subsequent myocardial infarction.

The high calcium content in coca explains why people used it for bone fractures. Because coca constricts <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> it also <b>serves</b> to oppose bleeding, and coca seeds were used for nosebleeds. Indigenous use of coca has also been reported {{as a treatment for}} malaria, ulcers, asthma, to improve digestion, to guard against bowel laxity, as an aphrodisiac, and credited with improving longevity. Modern studies have supported a number of these medical applications.|$|R

Endothelium, lining the first layer of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> <b>serves</b> as a dynamic interface in maintaining vascular homeostasis. Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of atherosclerosis development, signified by impaired nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability derived from endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). To investigated the molecular mechanisms by which eNOS-NO is regulated under physiological, pathophysiological and pharmacological contexts, I examined the role of two metabolic master molecules, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sirtuin 1 (silent information regulator 2 homolog, SIRT 1), in eNOS regulation and NO bioavailability. Primarily, I demonstrated that AMPK directly phosphorylates eNOS Ser- 633, in addition to Ser- 1177, leading to endothelial NO production, in response to hormonal (adiponectin), physical (shear stress), and pharmacological (atorvastatin) stimuli. Further, I found reduced eNOS phosphorylation in aortas from mice deficient in AMPKa 2 (AMPKa 2 -/-), confirming the AMPK-mediated eNOS regulation in vivo. In addition, with the application of Nano-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), I proved that eNOS Ser- 633 was able to compete with acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) Ser- 79 for AMPK phosphorylation. These findings suggest that AMPK phosphorylation of eNOS Ser- 633 is a functional signaling event for NO bioavailability in endothelial cells (ECs). In the second part, I focused on SIRT 1, a NAD + -dependent deacetylase and its modulation on eNOS. First, I found that SIRT 1 responds to laminar shear stress with increased protein level and activity in ECs. In parallel to the observation that SIRT 1 was significantly higher in ECs exposed to physiological pulsatile flow than pathophysiological oscillatory flow, SIRT 1 was shown to be higher in the mouse thoracic aorta exposed to athero-protective flow than in the aortic arch under athero-prone flow. Next, I revealed the functional consequences of the shear stress-enhanced SIRT 1 in ECs, including mitochondrial biogenesis and eNOS deacetylation. Subsequently, I studied the interplay of AMPK phosphorylation and SIRT 1 deacetylation on eNOS. By using AMPK inhibitor and eNOS Ser- 633 and - 1177 mutants, I demonstrated that AMPK phosphorylation of eNOS may prime SIRT 1 deacetylation of eNOS with attendant NO production. To verify this finding in vivo, I compared eNOS acetylation status in thoracic aortas from AMPKa 2 -/- mice and their wild-type littermates and found that AMPKa 2 -/- mice had a higher eNOS acetylation. Collectively, my study suggests that AMPK and SIRT 1 could synergistically enhance eNOS-derived NO under physiological cues, such as athero-protective flow...|$|R
