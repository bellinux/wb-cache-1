We first review the relevant psychology and experimental evidence on overconfidence. We then summarise the results of Malmendier and Tate ( 2005 a) on the impact of overconfidence on corporate investment. We present supplementary evidence on the relationship between CEOs' press portrayals and overconfident investment decisions. This alternative approach to measuring overconfidence, developed in Malmendier and Tate ( 2005 b), relies on the perception of outsiders rather than the CEO's own actions. The robustness of the results across such diverse proxies jointly corroborates previous findings and suggests new avenues to measuring executive overconfidence".

40|$|Managers' {{information}} disclosure to firm's outsiders {{plays an}} essential role for mitigating information asymmetry and agency problems. The main objective of this thesis is to analyze the managers' reporting incentives in a broader context, while considering the preferences of behavioural investors and the active role of financial analysts as target setters in particular. Further, this thesis aims to study the optimal disclosure policy of different firms {{in the form of}} guidance and to analyze its influence on the efficiency of analysts’ earnings forecasts. Overall, this thesis contributes to the broad research on <b>behavioural</b> corporate <b>finance</b> studying the determinants and consequences of managers' decisions when managers and (or) investors suffer cognitive biases and (or) have behavioural preferences. The analysis focuses on the investors' preferences as described in the prospect theory of Kahneman and Tversky (1979) and neglects any cognitive biases that might lead to irrational decisions. The contribution of this thesis is threefold. First, this thesis contributes to the empirical literature on the relevance of thresholds by showing that reported performance, particularly around the zero target, influences the market value of a firm and in particular the investors' perception of the value generated by intangibles such as R&D investments. Second, the thesis extends the theoretical literature on earnings manipulation by analyzing the managers' reporting incentives in an inter-temporal strategic game with the analysts where the managers' payoff is determined by investors using the analysts' consensus forecast as a target when evaluating earnings reports. Finally, instead of adapting the view that agents suffer some cognitive limitations, this thesis contributes to the literature that seeks economic explanations for the analysts' underreaction by showing empirically that managerial guidance is capable to explain such inefficiencies in the analysts' forecasting behavior...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the <b>behavioural</b> corporate <b>finance</b> {{question of how}} an acquirer’s recent financial performance – primarily ROA and Sales over- or underperformance relative to peers or its own past – influences their valuation after acquisition announcement. The connection is hypothesized {{to be caused by}} reference point effects affecting managerial risk propensity: Risk-seeking managers gamble with Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) and fail to maximize firm value. Extant theory – in the form of Prospect Theory and the Behavioural Theory of the Firm – suggests that such a relationship should exist. Empirical work into the relationship between firms’ positions relative to reference points and subsequent M&A performance has started recently, but the present studies are the first to consider the influence of both an acquirer’s operational over- and underperformance on market value, and accounting figures-based valuations. First, an event study assumes well-informed investors correctly price shares. A number of significant reference point effect-related relationships are observed, but without a dominant pattern. Second, M&A outcomes are valued based upon a market-to-book ratio decomposition technique from prior literature, to allow for potential stock mispricing. Two distinct effect patterns are revealed: linear and negative for a measure of fundamental value, and an inverted U-shape for a measure of acquirer mispricing. Third, the last study focuses on the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), as main decision maker, to explain the fundamental value outcome better. The negative linear relationship reappears for additional CEO-specific reference point measures. Moreover, some CEO characteristics also influence M&A outcomes directly, as well as in interaction with reference point measures. Overall, these findings suggest the existence of robust effects of initial positions relative to reference points on acquisition outcome, and the importance of the deciding managers. The results have potential implications for CEOs and further board members, investors, researchers and educators, as well as regulators...|$|R
40|$|The {{recognition}} of <b>behavioural</b> elements in <b>finance</b> has caused major {{shifts in the}} analytic framework pertaining to ratio-based modeling of corporate collapse. The modeling approach {{so far has been}} based on the classical rational theory in behavioural economics, which assumes that the financial ratios (i. e., the predictors of collapse) are static over time. The paper argues that, in the absence of rational economic theory, a static model is flawed, and that a suitable model instead is one that reflects the heuristic behavioural framework, which is what characterises behavioural attributes of company directors and in turn influences the accounting numbers used in calculating the financial ratios. This calls for a dynamic model: dynamic {{in the sense that it}} does not rely on a coherent assortment of financial ratios for signaling corporate collapse over multiple time periods. This paper provides empirical evidence, using a data set of Australian publicly listed companies, to demonstrate that a dynamic model consistently outperforms its static counterpart in signaling the event of collapse. On average, the overall predictive power of the dynamic model is 86. 83 % compared to an average overall predictive power of 69. 35 % for the static model. <br /...|$|R
50|$|<b>Behavioural</b> <b>finance</b> {{attempts}} to explain price anomalies {{in terms of}} the biased behaviour of individuals, mostly concerned with the agents themselves and to a lesser degree aggregation of agent behaviour. Statistical finance is concerned with emergent properties arising from systems with many interacting agents and as such {{attempts to}} explain price anomalies {{in terms of the}} collective behaviour. Emergent properties are largely independent of the uniqueness of individual agents because they are dependent {{on the nature of the}} interactions of the agents rather than the agents themselves. This approach has drawn strongly on ideas arising from complex systems, phase transitions, criticality, self-organized criticality, non-extensivity (see Tsallis entropy), q-Gaussian models, and agents based models (see agent based model); as these are known to be able to recover some of phenomenology of financial market data, the stylized facts, in particular the long-range memory and scaling due to long-range interactions.|$|E
5000|$|The theory {{component}} centres on {{decision making}} under {{uncertainty in the}} context of the financial markets, and the resultant economic and financial models. The degree essentially explores how rational investors would apply decision theory to the problem of investment. Investment under [...] "certainty" [...] is initially considered (Fisher separation theorem, [...] "theory of investment value", Modigliani-Miller theorem). [...] "Choice under uncertainty" [...] is then introduced, and the twin assumptions of rationality and market efficiency lead to modern portfolio theory, and the CAPM, and to the Black Scholes theory for option pricing. Where the program emphasizes economics, the curriculum is extended: it explores phenomena where these assumptions do not hold (noise trading, market microstructure, <b>behavioural</b> <b>finance)</b> and it discusses models which are further generalised (arbitrage pricing theory, continuous time finance / Martingale pricing) or extended (Multi-factor models, models of the short rate, Intertemporal CAPM, Black-Litterman model). Coursework here is often titled [...] "Asset pricing" [...] and [...] "Corporate finance theory".

40|$|A {{number of}} {{empirical}} studies have confirmed {{the existence of}} property cycles in various mature real estate markets. In this paper, we will see whether these results {{fit in with the}} existing relevant theories. The efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is one of the cornerstones of the mainstream finance. In the context of the equity market, one of the generally accepted implications of the EMH is the future price of a security is unpredictable. The real estate market, by various empirical studies, has found to be weak form efficient. It is thus natural to infer that no property cycle exists as otherwise it would imply the predictability of property price and that is not consistent with EMH. This study, after reviewing the up-to-date literature, found the Efficient Market Hypothesis has taken on a new face; it is separated from the Random Walk Hypothesis (RWH). Due to its infallibility in empirical testing, it could well be recessed to the role of benchmarking the relative efficiency of the market. The apparent inconsistency between the existence of property cycles and EMH therefore disappears. The <b>behavioural</b> school of <b>finance</b> proclaims that market may not be efficient all the time and provides an explanation for this. Under this school of thought, the apparent conflict between the existence of property cycles and EMH again disappears. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the {{financial}} turmoil of 2008 that followed the collapse of the housing bubble in the USA which was the starting point of a global economic crisis. Huge costs are borne by every part of society. Much wealth has been destroyed. Millions of jobs have been lost. The crisis has tarnished faith in free enterprise, in the financial system, and in financial theory. Likely, the era of laissez-faire capitalism that started during the Reagan-Thatcher years is ending. We are entering a period of profound uncertainty. It is imperative that the moral dimension of capitalism be restored. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on a review of theory and historical evidence relating to financial bubbles and financial regulation. Findings – The author offers suggestions on how to rebuild the global financial system. We need: a systemic risk regulator, independent from business and political influence; higher capital requirements for all systemically significant financial service firms; restrictions on proprietary trading in commercial banks; transparency in derivatives; new ways to compensate bankers that reduce the incentive to take excessive risks; consumer protection against defective financial products; and the re-establishment of the principle of fiduciary duty. Practical implications – The paper lists practical suggestions on how to reform the global financial system. Social implications – Economic success is based on trust. After the 2008 crisis, regulatory reform is the best way to rebuild trust in the financial system.

40|$|Purpose – When finance {{managers}} face decisions, they do {{not always}} make clinical evaluations using rational methodology, but systematically depart from utility maximisation. This article addresses biases {{that are related to}} risk propensity, and categorises them under five headings: decision makers' characteristics and perception; reference levels; mental accounting and the assumption of mean reversion; the longshot bias or overconfidence; and the desire for immediate gratification. The research reported in the paper seeks to understand the mechanisms of these biases using a study of decision making by Australian finance executives in a setting that is representative of a typical business decision. Design/methodology/approach – This paper uses a case study that was designed to identify why decision makers facing choices will prefer a risky alternative. Data were collected using e-mail contact and an electronic survey. Respondents (n= 67) provided demographic data, and answered questions that probed their attitudes and decision styles. Risk propensity was quantified by respondents' attitude towards a risky decision, and was explained using independent variables related to decision maker traits. Findings – Just over half the executives proved willing to take a risk, and almost half the variance in their risk propensity was explained roughly equally by respondents': endowment, perception of risk's role in decisions, assessment of alternative choices, and expectation of the decision's outcome. Manipulation of the cases along four dimensions varied the decision's facts, but they proved only marginally significant to risk taking. Originality/value – The study provides a practical explanation of the risk taking behaviour of finance executives; confirms that context is more important to decisions than their content; and adds to the growing body of applied <b>behavioural</b> research in <b>finance.</b> Decision making, Managers, Risk management...|$|R
