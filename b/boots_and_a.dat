5|$|Madonna also {{performed}} {{an excerpt of}} the song at the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show in 2012, where she was joined by Cee Lo Green and by a large marching band. The same year, the song was included on The MDNA Tour. Following an 8-minute monologue against intolerance, the song was reinvented and performed in a Basque, folk acoustic version, relying only on drums, which were played by the Basque band Kalakan, and Madonna's vocal harmony. Madonna's outfit during the performance consisted of an all-leather look, a custom design by Hervé Léger and Max Azria, with knee-high <b>boots</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> mini fur bolero, while her dancers were dressed as soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Pound was in Rome {{early in}} September when Italy surrendered. He {{borrowed}} {{a pair of}} hiking <b>boots</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> knapsack and left the city, having finally decided to tell Mary about his wife and son. Heading north, he spent a night in an air-raid shelter in Bologna, then took a train to Verona and walked {{the rest of the}} way; he apparently traveled over 450 miles in all. Mary almost failed to recognize him when he arrived, he was so dirty and tired. He told her everything about his other family; she later admitted she felt more pity than anger.|$|E
5|$|The artwork for {{the album}} was {{produced}} during a photo shoot which remains the most expensive one to be ever developed in Romania, with the total costs amounting to €15,000. It was shot by Edward Aninaru at the Media Pro Pictures studios in Buftea. Over 50 male and female models were featured in the shooting, which consisted of two different images — an uncensored one leaked onto {{the internet and the}} photograph used to commercialize the album. The artwork portrays Inna standing {{in the center of a}} background with semi-nude models wearing a red-black suit, long <b>boots</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> French-like bun.|$|E

This scene is intercut with scenes of Rihanna in a bunker; she wears an army hard hat, pink lace up <b>boots,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> skin-colored top with small black rectangles covering her breasts. Halfway through the first verse, the scene changes to a daytime desert scene in which Rihanna wears a low cut, short black dress with spiked shoulder pads, and walks through the location as small explosions occur around her.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the next}} match, Diesel threw Razor Ramon out of the ring, {{allowing}} Michaels to remove the turnbuckle padding. Payton argued with Michaels about his interference, drawing the referee's attention. Michaels {{seized the opportunity to}} attack Ramon behind the referee's back. Diesel used two big <b>boots</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> series of submission holds to maintain the advantage. When he tried to throw Ramon into the unprotected turnbuckle, Payton pointed out the missing padding to the referee, who stood in the way to prevent the move. Soon after, Diesel tried to ram Ramon into the turnbuckle, but Ramon escaped and pushed Diesel into the turnbuckle. Ramon kept his momentum by performing a bulldog, a scoop slam, and a superplex. When Michaels tried to get involved again, Payton chased him around the outside of the ring. While the referee was distracted, Michaels entered the ring and tried to perform a superkick while Diesel held Ramon. Ramon moved, causing Michaels to kick Diesel instead. Ramon pinned Diesel to win the match and regain the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E

25|$|Western riders wear a long-sleeved shirt, denim jeans, <b>boots,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> wide-brimmed cowboy hat. Cowboy boots, {{which have}} pointed toes and higher heels than a {{traditional}} riding boot, {{are designed to}} prevent the rider's foot from slipping through the stirrup during a fall, preventing the rider from being dragged—most western saddles have no safety bars for the leathers or automatic stirrup release mechanism. A rider may wear protective leather leggings called chaps. Clean, well-fitting work clothing is the usual outfit seen in rodeo, cutting and reining competitions, especially for men, though sometimes {{both men and women}} wear brighter colors or finer fabrics for competition than for work.|$|E

25|$|During his youth, Stalin usually wore a red satin shirt, grey coat, and red fedora, or {{alternatively}} a traditional Georgian chokha and white hood. At {{the time he}} grew his hair long and often had a beard. His cultivation of a scruffy appearance deliberately sought to reject middle-class aesthetic values. After the summer of 1918 until his death he took to wearing military-style clothing, in particular long black <b>boots</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> light-coloured collarless tunics, and also carried a gun. He had few material demands and lived plainly, with simple and inexpensive clothing and furniture; his interest was in power rather than wealth. He was a lifelong smoker, who smoked both a pipe and cigarettes.|$|E
25|$|Back in the 1940s {{there were}} many members {{that were in the}} military. During that time period it was not easy for all of the members to get {{together}} for meetings because of gas rationing. On May 27 and 28, 1944 the first formal convention was held. This meeting was led by Jane Farrow and Jo Folden in Columbus, Ohio. The first Regional Meeting was held later that year in Plainfield, New Jersey. From this came the decision on the colors and the logo for Motor Maids. It was decided that royal blue and silver gray would make up the colors and a shield would represent the logo. Another thing that came from this meeting was the uniform for the group. At the start the uniforms were tailor-made of silver-gray gabardine with royal blue piping. This soon changed and the uniform became gray slacks, royal blue over-blouse with white <b>boots,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> tie. Down the road in 2006, the group voted to change the uniform again. It was then changed to what it is in present day. It consists of black pants and boots, royal blue mock neck long sleeved shirt with a white cotton vest, and white gloves. White gloves were added in 1941 when Howard Foley went to the motor maids with the idea of parading at the Charity Newsies Race. During this parade, the Motor Maids wore white gloves making them known as the “Ladies of the White Gloves”. They continued to parade for this event each year up until 1979. The Motor Maids are required to wear royal blue mock turtleneck and white cotton vest, jet-black slacks, and clean black footwear. For parades white gloves are added. The rest are required at a convention for the parade, formal group picture, and banquet.|$|E
