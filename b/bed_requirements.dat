40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a model for}} projecting future hospital <b>bed</b> <b>requirements,</b> based on clinical judgment and basic probability theory. Clinical judgment is used to define various categories of care, including a category for patients who are inappropriately hospitalized, for a large teaching hospital with a heavy indigent and psychiatric workload. Survey results and discharge abstract data are then used to calculate expected discharges and patient days for each clinical category. These expected discharges and patient days are converted into estimated <b>bed</b> <b>requirements</b> using a simple deterministic equation. Results of this multistage model are compared with the results obtained from exercising the simple deterministic equation alone. Because the multistage model removes patients from the hospital if they are deemed inappropriately placed, this model results in the projection of 5. 1 percent fewer hospital beds than the simple deterministic equation alone...|$|E

30|$|Introduction: Planning for ICU-bed provision, with a {{statistical}} confidence level, required {{the average number}} of critically-ill patients, their average ICU length of stay (LOS), and the fluctuation/variance of these two parameters.

40|$|A {{study of}} {{paediatric}} intensive care usage and need was {{undertaken in the}} former English Northern region to define appropriate local provision {{in the light of}} apparently conflicting published evidence. It was hypothesised that daily bed need would follow a Poisson distribution. All admissions of children aged less than 15 years who required intensive care in the region were recorded retrospectively for the financial year 1993 / 4. The mean number of beds occupied was 11. 7 per day, which is equivalent to 20. 7 beds per million children per day. The distribution of numbers of beds used mirrored a Poisson distribution closely, and the predicted <b>bed</b> <b>requirement</b> to cover 95 % of days in the year was in agreement with that observed. Review of recommendations for paediatric intensive care provision from other studies suggests that apparent differences arise largely from the effect of different sizes of population served, and that, when allowance is made for this, underlying rates of <b>bed</b> <b>requirement</b> are strikingly similar, with a mean of around 20 per million children per day. A formula is given for the application of this model to local populations...|$|R

Separating the elective theatre activity into day case and inpatient sessions will tend to produce inpatient theatre sessions with a disproportionate number of longer procedures.

This study documents the changes over 25 years in a district general hospital. METHODS: Details of all general surgical (including urological) emergency admissions were analysed for every fourth calendar year from 1974 to 1998. RESULTS: A total of 19, 931 patients were admitted during the 7 years studied, rising from 2137 in 1974 to 3578 in 1994 (3377 in 1998). Mean age increased from 47. 9 years to 52. 6 years while mean length of stay fell from 9. 5 days to 5. 3 days. Hospital mortality decreased from 6. 6 % to 3. 7 %.

40|$|The flow of {{patients}} through geriatric hospitals {{has been previously}} {{described in terms of}} acute (shortâstay), rehabilitation (mediumâstay), and longâstay states where the bed occupancy at a census point is modelled by a mixed exponential model using BOMPS (Bed Occupancy Modelling and Planning System). In this a patient is initially admitted to acute care. The majority of the patients are discharged within a few days into their own homes or through death. The rest are converted into mediumâstay patients where they could stay for a few months and thereafter either leave the system or move on to a longâstay compartment where they could stay until they die. The model forecasts the average length of stay as well as the average number {{of patients}} in each state.

By dividing the total population into groups, the revised formula can better reflect different population growth rates of the groups. The revised formula incorporates average waiting time in a queue rather than using a fixed occupancy rate. The revised formula is based on the same fundamental idea as the present formula: that of applying rates determined by statistics in a base year to a projected population at some point in the future. The revised formula does, however, more closely reflect the character or mix of the base population as well as any projected changes in that mix.

40|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{detention}} capacity (the U. S. government measures capacity by the number {{of detention}} beds), tens of thousands of apprehended illegal aliens are released into the U. S. interior each year, instead of being removed from the country. This vulnerability can be exploited by terrorist groups wanting to enter the United States. We construct a queueing model of the U. S. detention and removal operations, and derive approximate analytical expressions for key performance measures, including a simple normal approximation for the required number of beds. Due to shortcomings in the U. S. government's data collection procedures, we cannot directly estimate all of the model's parameter values. Consequently, we use the approximate analytical expressions and the 2003 U. S. government data quantifying these key performance measures to estimate several unknown parameter values. Although current funding is for approximately 21, 000 detention beds, we estimate that approximately 34, 500 beds are needed to remove all potential detainees (this does not include nonviolent, noncriminal Mexicans, who are returned to Mexico within several hours) based on 2003 data. The dramatic increase in the arrivals of potential detainees since 2003 suggests that approximately 50, 000 beds are currently required, although the estimation of future arrival rates is very difficult due to uncertainties about the future direction of U.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{clinical}} outcome {{and costs of}} care of psychiatric patients allocated to community multidisciplinary teams or to hospital based care programmes after discharge from inpatient care. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Inner London (Paddington and North Kensington) and outer London (Brent) psychiatric services. SUBJECTS: 155 patients with severe mental illness with a previous admission within the past 2 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ratings of clinical psychopathology, depression, anxiety, and social functioning; comprehensive costs of health care. RESULTS: Clinical outcomes were available for 133 patients and cost data for 144 patients after 1 year. The clinical outcomes of the two models of care were essentially similar, but admission to hospital was more likely in the hospital based care group {{and the costs of}} health care were 14 % greater per patient than in the community group. This difference, however, was dwarfed by a twofold difference in the costs of care in the outer London services compared with those in inner London. This was explained largely by greater inpatient care for outer London patients (58 median bed days v 18 for inner London patients), more of which was provided by extracontractual referrals to other psychiatric hospitals as Brent had only 0. 28 / 1000 beds available for acute adult patients compared with 0. 82 / 1000 in Paddington and North Kensington over the period of the study. CONCLUSION: Aftercare by community teams for psychiatric patients with severe mental illness has a similar outcome to hospital based aftercare but with fewer admissions to hospital. When psychiatric <b>bed</b> <b>requirements</b> are insufficient for a population, however, neither form of aftercare is effective as greater use of hospital beds elsewhere swamps any advantage of community care programmes, with disintegration and discontinuity of psychiatric services leading to escalating costs...|$|E

Each unit comprises a tri-axial accelerometer, a tri-axial gyroscope, and a tri-axial magnetometer. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, deterministic modeling and calibration of the units are performed, based on real test data acquired from a flight motion simulator. The deterministic modeling and identification of accelerometers is performed based on a traditional model. A novel technique is proposed for the deterministic modeling of the gyroscopes, relaxing the test <b>bed</b> <b>requirement</b> and enabling their in-use calibration. This is followed by the presentation of a new sensor measurement model for magnetometers that improves the calibration error by modeling the orientation-dependent magnetic disturbances in a gimbaled angular position control machine. Model-based Levenberg-Marquardt and modelfree evolutionary optimization algorithms are adopted to estimate the calibration parameters of sensors. In the second part of the thesis, stochastic error modeling of the two inertial sensor units is addressed. Maximum likelihood estimation is employed for estimating the parameters of the different noise components of the sensors, after the dominant noise components are identified. Evolutionary and gradient-based optimization algorithms are implemented to maximize the likelihood function, namely particle swarm optimization and gradient-ascent optimization. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified through experiments and the results are compared to the classical Allan variance technique. The results obtained with the proposed approach have higher accuracy and require a smaller sample data size, resulting in calibration experiments of shorter duration. Finally, the two sensor units are compared in terms of repeatability, present measurement noise, and unaided navigation performance. SeÃ§er, GÃ¶rkemM. S...|$|R

For inpatient hospital care, capacity management requires information on beds and nursing staff capacity, {{on a daily}} as well as annual basis. This paper presents a comprehensive capacity model that gives insight into required nursing staff capacity and opportunities to improve capacity utilization on a ward level. Methods A capacity model was developed to calculate required nursing staff capacity. The model used historical bed utilization, nurse-patient ratios, and parameters concerning contract hours to calculate beds and nursing staff needed per shift {{and the number of}} nurses needed on an annual basis in a ward. The model was applied to three different capacity management problems on three separate groups of hospital wards. The problems entailed operational, tactical, and strategic management issues: optimizing working processes on pediatric wards, predicting the consequences of reducing length of stay on nursing staff required on a cardiology ward, and calculating the nursing staff consequences of merging two internal medicine wards. Results It was possible to build a model based on easily available data that calculate the nursing staff capacity needed daily and annually and that accommodate organizational improvements. Organizational improvement processes were initiated in three different groups of wards. For two pediatric wards, the most important improvements were found to be improving working processes so that the agreed nurse-patient ratios could be attained. In the second case, for a cardiology ward, what-if analyses with the model showed that workload could be substantially lowered by reducing length of stay. The third case demonstrated the possible savings in capacity that could be achieved by merging two small internal medicine wards. Conclusion A comprehensive capacity model was developed and successfully applied to support capacity decisions on operational, tactical, and strategic levels. It appeared to be a useful tool for supporting discussions between wards and hospital management by giving objective and quantitative insight into staff and <b>bed</b> <b>requirements.</b> Moreover, the model was applied to initiate organizational improvements, which resulted in more efficient capacity utilization. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{conduct an}} {{economic}} evaluation of directly observed treatment (DOT) and conventionally delivered {{treatment for the}} management of new cases of tuberculosis in adults. Design: Community based directly observed treatment, which has been implemented in the Hlabisa district of South Africa since 1991, was compared with a conventional approach to tuberculosis treatment widely used in Africa. Each was assessed in terms of cost, cost effectiveness, and feasibility of implementation within existing resource constraints. Setting: Hlabisa Health District, South Africa. Subjects: Adult patients with new cases of tuberculosis on smear testing; the number of cases increased from 20 per month to over 100 from 1991 to 1996. Main outcome measures: Cost of case management in 1996, cost effectiveness in terms of the cost per case cured, and <b>bed</b> <b>requirements</b> in comparison with bed availability for the 1990, 1993, and 1996 caseload. Costs are expressed in US dollars at values for 1996. Results: Directly observed treatment was 2. 8 times cheaper overall than conventional treatment ($ 740. 90 compared with $ 2047. 70) to deliver. Directly observed treatment worked out 2. 4 - 4. 2 times more cost effective, costing $ 890. 50 per patient cured compared with either $ 2095. 60 (best case) or $ 3700. 40 (worst case) for conventional treatment The 1996 caseload of tuberculosis required 47 beds to be dedicated to tuberculosis to implement directly observed treatment whereas conventionally delivered treatment would have required 160 beds; the current number of beds for tuberculosis treatment in Hlabisa is fixed at 56. Conclusions: Because of the reduced stay in hospital, directly observed treatment is cheaper, more cost effective, and more feasible than conventional treatment in managing tuberculosis in Hlabisa, given the existing hospital bed capacity and the escalating caseload due to the HIV/AIDS epidemic Such results may hold elsewhere, and wherever conventional tuberculosis management is practised a switch to directly observed treatment will increase hospital capacity to cope with a growing caseload. 5 page(s...|$|E

For two pediatric wards, the most important improvements were found to be improving working processes so that the agreed nurse-patient ratios could be attained. In the second case, for a cardiology ward, what-if analyses with the model showed that workload could be substantially lowered by reducing length of stay. The third case demonstrated the possible savings in capacity that could be achieved by merging two small internal medicine wards. Conclusion: A comprehensive capacity model was developed and successfully applied to support capacity decisions on operational, tactical, and strategic levels. It appeared to be a useful tool for supporting discussions between wards and hospital management by giving objective and quantitative insight into staff and <b>bed</b> <b>requirements.</b> Moreover, the model was applied to initiate organizational improvements, which resulted in more efficient capacity utilizatio...|$|E
40|$|THESIS 10601 Wind energy plants, dolphins, {{and many}} other ocean {{engineering}} structures are supported on large diameter rigid monopiles. For such structures lateral loads are more critical for the design and analysis compared with the gravitational loads and foundation piles are required to withstand {{a large number of}} repeated lateral load cycles during their design life. In such applications, the lateral forces and bending moments resulting from wind/wave loadings must be economically and safely transferred to the sea <b>bed.</b> Such <b>requirements</b> make the pile response deflection sensitive in addition to be load earring capacity posturing. The behaviour of large diameter rigid monopiles in general, under long-term low-amplitude repeated lateral loading, is not well documented. Existing methods for estimating the accumulated lateral strain (rotation) response of monopiles are based on very limited field/experimental laboratory data and are currently not capable of explicitly accounting for site-specific soil properties and loading characteristics...|$|R
40|$|In 1941 the Texas Legislature {{appropriated}} $ 500, 000 to the Board of Regents of the University of Texas {{to establish}} a cancer research hospital. The M. D. Anderson Foundation offered to match the appropriation with a grant of an equal sum {{and to provide a}} permanent site in Houston. In August, 1942 the Board of Regent of the University and the Trustees of the Foundation signed an agreement to embark on this project. This institution was to be the first one in the medical center, which was incorporated in October, 1945. The Board of Trustees of the Texas Medical Center commissioned a hospital survey to: - Define the needed hospital facilities in the area - Outline an integrated program to meet these needs - Define the facilities to be constructed - Prepare general recommendations for efficient progress The Hospital Study included information about population, hospitals, and other health care and education facilities in Houston and Harris County at that time. It included projected health care needs for future populations, education needs, and facility needs. It also included detailed information on needs for chronic illnesses, a school of public health, and nursing education. This study provides valuable information about the general population and the state of medicine in Houston and Harris County in the 1940 s. It gives a unique perspective on the anticipated future as civic leaders looked forward in building the city and region. This document is critical {{to an understanding of the}} Texas Medical Center, Houston and medicine as they are today. SECTIONS INCLUDE: Abstract The Abstract was a summary of the 400 page document including general information about the survey area, community medical assets, and current and projected medical needs which the Texas Medical Center should meet. The 123 recommendations were both general (e. g., 12. âThat in future planning, the present auxiliary department of the larger hospitals be considered inadequate to carry an added teaching research program of any sizable scope. â) and specific (e. g., 22. That 14. 3 % of the total acute <b>bed</b> <b>requirement</b> be allotted for obstetric care, reflecting a <b>bed</b> <b>requirement</b> of 522 by 1950, increasing to 1, 173 by 1970. â) Section I: Survey Area This section basically addressed the first objective of the survey: âdefine the needed hospital facilities in the area. â Based on the admission statistics of hospitals, Harris County was included in the survey, with the recognition that growth from out-lying regional areas could occur. Population characteristics and vital statistics were included, with future trends discussed. Each of the hospitals in the area and government and private health organizations, such as the City-County Welfare Board, were documented. Statistics on the facilities use and capacity were given. Eighteen recommendations and observations on the survey area were given. Section II: Community Program This section basically addressed the second objective of the survey: âoutline an integrated program to meet these needs. â The information from the Survey Area section formed the basis of the plans for development of the Texas Medical Center. In this section, specific needs, such as what medical specialties were needed, the location and general organization of a medical center, and the academic aspects were outlined. Seventy-four recommendations for these plans were provided. Section III: The Texas Medical Center The third and fourth objectives are addressed. The specific facilities were listed and recommendations were made. Section IV: Special Studies: Chronic Illness The five leading causes of death (heart disease, cancer, âapoplexyâ, nephritis, and tuberculosis) were identified and statistics for morbidity and mortality provided. Diagnostic, prevention and care needs were discussed. Recommendations on facilities and other solutions were made. Section IV: Special Studies: School of Public Health An overview of the state of schools of public health in the US was provided. Information on the direction and need of this special school was also provided. Recommendations on development and organization of the proposed school were made. Section IV: Special Studies: Needs and Education Facilities for Nurses Nursing education was connected with hospitals, but the changes to academic nursing programs were discussed. The needs for well-trained nurses in an expanded medical environment were anticipated to result in significant increased demands of these professionals. An overview of the current situation in the survey area and recommendations were provided. Appendix A Maps, tables and charts provide background and statistical information for the previous sections. Appendix B Detailed census data for specific areas of the survey area in the report were included. Sketches of each of the fifteen hospitals and five other health institutions showed historical information, accreditations, staff, available facilities (beds, x-ray, etc.), academic capabilities and financial information.

40|$|An {{instrument}} {{was developed to}} study the use of hospital beds and discharge arrangements of a cohort of 847 admissions to the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, for a three week period during February-March 1986. For only 38 % of bed days were patients considered to have medical, nursing, or life support reasons for requiring a provincial teaching hospital <b>bed.</b> The <b>requirements</b> for a <b>bed</b> in the hospital decreased with the patient's age and length of stay in hospital. For only a tenth of patients was the general practitioner concerned in discussions with hospital staff about the patient's discharge and less than one third of patients had been given more than 24 hours' notice of discharge. Several features might increase the proportion of bed days that are occupied by patients with positive reasons for being in hospital. Among these are an increased frequency of ward rounds by consultants, or delegating discharge decisions by consultants to other staff; providing diagnostic related protocols for planning the length of stay in hospital; planned discharges; and providing liaison nurses to help with communication with primary care staff...|$|R
