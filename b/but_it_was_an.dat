5|$|Overmars {{suffered}} a minor setback prior to Euro 2000 {{with a sore}} thigh muscle. However, he resumed training and was declared fit for the Netherlands opening match against Czech Republic, where he started on the bench. His introduction brought about the only goal of the match – a penalty scored the 89th minute. Ronald de Boer was adjudged to have had his shirt pulled whilst jumping to meet Overmars' cross. In the quarter-finals, he scored twice in the team's 6–1 win against Yugoslavia. The Netherlands went on to lose their semi-final to Italy on penalties. Overmars played in eight of the national team's ten 2002 World Cup qualifiers, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> unsuccessful campaign as they failed {{to qualify for the}} finals.|$|E

Tallon scored 204 runs at 22.66 without managing a half-century and made 17 dismissals.|$|E

5|$|The Guardian {{reviewer}} {{observed that}} the setting of Mr Perrin and Mr Traill – a second-rate public school – was clearly drawn from life, as indeed it was. The boys of Epsom College were delighted with the thinly disguised version of their school, but the college authorities were not, and Walpole was persona non grata at Epsom for many years. This was of no practical consequence, as {{he had no intention}} of returning to the teaching profession, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> early illustration of his capacity, noted by Benson, for unthinkingly giving offence, though being hypersensitive to criticism himself.|$|E

It capped off an unhappy June for Woodfull; he had scored only 120 runs at 13.33 for the month, with rain interruptions being frequent.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, {{the only}} Soviet factory {{suitable}} for T-26 production was the Bolshevik Factory in Leningrad, which had had experience manufacturing the MS-1 (T-18) light tanks since 1927. It was also {{planned to use}} the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, which was under construction at that time. But {{the production of the}} T-26 proved to be much more complicated than the semi-handicraft assembly of the MS-1, so the planned production of 500 T-26s in 1931 proved to be impossible. The Bolshevik Factory needed to convert all tank drawings from imperial units into metric, in order to develop a production technology, special tools, and equipment. The first 10 T-26s were assembled in July 1931 – they were identical to British Vickers 6-Ton tanks except for their armament. Soviet tanks were armed with the 37mm Hotchkiss (PS-1) gun in the right turret and the 7.62mm DT tank machine gun in the left turret. These T-26s from the development batch were of low quality and made from mild steel, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> important test of the new tank production technology.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta's {{academic}} progress was unremarkable, and in July 1912 {{he became an}} apprentice to the carpenter at the mission. At Easter 1912, he professed his dedication to Christianity and began undergoing catechism. In 1913, he underwent the Kikuyu circumcision ritual; the missionaries generally disapproved of this custom, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> important aspect of Kikuyu tradition, allowing Kenyatta to be recognised as an adult. Asked to take a Christian name, he chose both John and Peter after the eponymous Apostles in the New Testament. The missionaries however insisted that he select only one, and so he chose Johnstone, the -stone being selected {{because it was a}} Biblical reference to Peter. Accordingly, he was baptised as Johnstone Kamau in August 1914. After his baptism, Kenyatta moved out of the mission dormitory and lived with friends. Having completed his apprenticeship to a carpenter, Kenyatta requested that the mission allow him to be an apprentice stonemason, but they refused. Kenyatta then requested that he be recommended for employment, but the head missionary refused because of an allegation of minor dishonesty.|$|E
5|$|The {{views of}} historians {{of the outcome}} of the battle changed {{with the passage of time}} and the {{changing}} political situations surrounding them. Kutuzov proclaimed a victory both to the army and to Emperor Alexander. While many a general throughout history claimed victory out of defeat (Ramses II of Egypt did so) and in this case, Kutuzov was the one man to whom the entire Russian Army could give its allegiance, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> army that, despite the huge losses, considered itself undefeated. Announcing a defeat would have removed Kutuzov from his command, and further damaged an army that had endured much and still stood proud. While Alexander was not deceived by the announcement, it gave him the justification needed to allow Kutuzov to march his army off to rebuild the Russian forces and later complete the near utter destruction of the French army. As such, what was said by Kutuzov and those supporting his views was allowed to pass into the histories of the time unchecked.|$|E

25|$|With the Cowboys {{traditionally}} hosting Thanksgiving Day games, separate uniform {{practices have}} been used for these games in recent years.

25|$|Following his {{retirement}} from playing, Reedman was appointed {{coach of the}} lowly West Adelaide Football Club in 1908. To the end of 1907, West Adelaide had won only 23 and drawn 1 of the 145 SAFA matches they had played, and had been perennially close to or {{on the bottom of}} the ladder. Reedman coached West Adelaide to its first ever premiership in 1908, and then defeated Victorian Football League (VFL) champions Carlton Football Club to become Champions of Australia. Reedman promptly left West Adelaide to return to North Adelaide for one last season as a player, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> inauspicious finale, as the red and whites finished second last.|$|E

In June 1718, Blackbeard ran the ship aground at Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina. In late 1996, Intersal, a private firm working under a permit with the state of North Carolina, discovered the remains of the vessel. The shipwreck lies in 28 feet (8.5m) of water about one mile (1.6km) offshore of Fort Macon State Park, Atlantic Beach, North Carolina. Thirty-one cannons have been identified to date and more than 250,000 artifacts have been recovered. The cannon are of different origins, such as Swedish, English and possibly French, and of different sizes, as would be expected with a colonial pirate crew.|$|E

In March 1970 Bahá'ís going to a conference at Beaufort in the far south of the state and another in April in Colombia. This conference was focused at educators and the profession of education aimed at observing the UN International Education Year of 1970. Speakers at the conference included Benjamin Payton, president of Benedict College and Daniel Jordan of the University of Massachusetts and other institutions including the Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly. Participants included public school teachers from African American population centers and institutions.|$|E
25|$|<b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> {{external}} threat, {{more than}} anything else, that mended relations. While traditional Jewish society remained well entrenched in backward Eastern Europe, reports of the rapid acculturation and religious laxity in the West troubled both camps. When the Haskalah, the Jewish Enlightenment, appeared in Galicia and Congress Poland in the 1810s, it was soon perceived as a dire threat. The maskilim themselves detested Hasidism as an anti-rationalist and barbaric phenomenon, as did Western Jews of all shades, including the most right-wing Orthodox such as Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer. In Galicia especially, hostility towards it defined the Haskalah to a large extent, from the staunchly observant Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Chajes and Joseph Perl to the radical anti-Talmudists like Osias Schorr. The Enlightened, who revived Hebrew grammar, often mocked their rivals' lack of eloquence in the language. While a considerable proportion of the Misnagdim were not adverse to {{at least some of}} the Haskalas goals, the Rebbes were unremittingly hostile.|$|E
25|$|Having coached in South Africa {{on several}} {{occasions}} earlier in his career, in the 1975/76 winter Titmus played for Orange Free State in that country's Currie Cup competition, and took 42 wickets at 16.30.

He reappeared sporadically for Middlesex in 1979, 1980 and 1982. His very last appearance came by accident: attending the Middlesex v Surrey match in 1982 as a spectator (aged 49), he was prevailed upon to play by Middlesex captain Mike Brearley, and the gamble paid off: Titmus took 3–43 on a pitch taking spin, and Middlesex won by 58 runs.
