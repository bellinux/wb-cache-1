25|$|Three {{different}} approaches {{are commonly used}} in business valuation: the income approach, the asset-based approach, and the market approach. Within each of these approaches, there are various techniques for determining {{the value of a}} business using the definition of value appropriate for the appraisal assignment. Generally, the income approaches determine value by calculating the net present value of the benefit stream generated by the business (discounted cash flow); the asset-based approaches determine value by adding the sum of the parts of the business (net asset value); and the market approaches determine value by comparing the subject company to other companies in the same industry, of the same size, and/or within the same region. A number of <b>business</b> <b>valuation</b> models can be constructed that utilize various methods under the three <b>business</b> <b>valuation</b> approaches. Venture Capitalists and Private Equity professionals have long used the First chicago method which essentially combines the income approach with the market approach.|$|E

25|$|Careful {{matching}} of {{the discount}} rate to the appropriate measure of economic income {{is critical to the}} accuracy of the <b>business</b> <b>valuation</b> results. Net cash flow is a frequent choice in professionally conducted business appraisals. The rationale behind this choice is that this earnings basis corresponds to the equity discount rate derived from the Build-Up or CAPM models: the returns obtained from investments in publicly traded companies can easily be represented in terms of net cash flows. At the same time, {{the discount rate}}s are generally also derived from the public capital markets data.|$|E

2500|$|The {{capital asset}} pricing model (CAPM) {{provides}} one method of determining a discount rate in <b>business</b> <b>valuation.</b> The CAPM originated from the Nobel Prize-winning studies of Harry Markowitz, James Tobin, and William Sharpe. The method derives {{the discount rate}} by adding risk premium to the risk-free rate. The risk premium is derived by multiplying the equity risk premium with [...] "beta", a measure of stock price volatility. Beta is compiled by various researchers for particular industries and companies, and measures systematic risks of investment.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is similar}} to using the market {{approach}} in the income approach instead of adding separate (and potentially redundant) measures of risk in the build-up approach. [...] The use of total beta (developed by Aswath Damodaran) {{is a relatively new}} concept. [...] It is, however, gaining acceptance in the <b>business</b> <b>valuation</b> community since it is based on modern portfolio theory. [...] Total beta can help appraisers develop a cost of capital who were content to use their intuition alone when previously adding a purely subjective company-specific risk premium in the build-up approach.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Business</b> <b>valuation</b> {{results can}} vary {{considerably}} {{depending upon the}} choice of both the standard and premise of value. [...] In an actual business sale, it would be expected that the buyer and seller, each with an incentive to achieve an optimal outcome, would determine the fair market value of a business asset that would compete {{in the market for}} such an acquisition.

[...] In addition to estimating the selling price of a business, the same valuation tools are often used by business appraisers to resolve disputes related to estate and gift taxation, divorce litigation, allocate business purchase price among business assets, establish a formula for estimating the value of partners' ownership interest for buy-sell agreements, and many other business and legal purposes such as in shareholders deadlock, divorce litigation and estate contest.

2500|$|The market {{approach}} to <b>business</b> <b>valuation</b> {{is rooted in}} the economic principle of competition: that in a free market the supply and demand forces will drive the price of business assets to a certain equilibrium. Buyers would not pay more for the business, and the sellers will not accept less, than the price of a comparable business enterprise. The buyers and sellers are assumed to be equally well informed and acting in their own interests to conclude a transaction. It is similar in many respects to the [...] "comparable sales" [...] method that is commonly used in real estate appraisal. The market price of the stocks of publicly traded companies engaged in the same or a similar line of business, whose shares are actively traded in a free and open market, can be a valid indicator of value when the transactions in which stocks are traded are sufficiently similar to permit meaningful comparison.|$|E

2500|$|ROV {{is usually}} used when {{the value of}} a project is {{contingent}} on the value of some other asset or underlying variable. (For example, the viability of a mining project is contingent on the price of gold; if the price is too low, management will abandon the mining rights, if sufficiently high, management will develop the ore body. Again, a DCF valuation would capture only one of these outcomes.) Here: (1) using financial option theory as a framework, the decision to be taken is identified as corresponding to either a call option or a put option; (2) an appropriate valuation technique is then employed – usually a variant on the Binomial options model or a bespoke simulation model, while Black Scholes type formulae are used less often; see Contingent claim valuation. (3) The [...] "true" [...] value of the project is then the NPV of the [...] "most likely" [...] scenario plus the option value.

[...] Although it is in principle different from managerial finance which studies the financial management of all firms, rather than corporations alone, the main concepts in the study of corporate finance are applicable to the financial problems of all kinds of firms. [...] Corporate finance generally involves balancing risk and profitability, while attempting to maximize an entity's assets, net incoming cash flow and the value of its stock, and generically entails three primary areas of capital resource allocation. In the first, [...] "capital budgeting", management must choose which [...] "projects" [...] (if any) to undertake. The discipline of capital budgeting may employ standard <b>business</b> <b>valuation</b> techniques or even extend to real options valuation; see Financial modeling. [...] The second, [...] "sources of capital" [...] relates to how these investments are to be funded: investment capital can be provided through different sources, such as by shareholders, in the form of equity (privately or via an initial public offering), creditors, often in the form of bonds, and the firm's operations (cash flow). Short-term funding or working capital is mostly provided by banks extending a line of credit. The balance between these elements forms the company's capital structure. [...] The third, [...] "the dividend policy", requires management to determine whether any unappropriated profit (excess cash) is to be retained for future investment / operational requirements, or instead to be distributed to shareholders, and if so, in what form. [...] Short term financial management is often termed [...] "working capital management", and relates to cash-, inventory- and debtors management.|$|E
