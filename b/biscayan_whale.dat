But like the ibex, and some other animals which man has ceased to hunt, because he fancies that he has killed them all, they seem inclined to reappear. For in 1854 one was washed ashore near St. Jean de Luz, at news whereof Eschricht, the great Danish naturalist, travelled night and day from Copenhagen, and secured the skeleton of the new-old monster.|$|E
2500|$|Up to 49 ports had whaling establishments {{along the}} coast from the French Basque country to Cape Finisterre. The {{principal}} target of the trade was what the French Basques called [...] "sarde". It was later called the <b>Biscayan</b> right <b>whale</b> (Balaena biscayensis), and {{is now known as}} the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). It was caught during its migration from the months of October–November to February–March, with peak catching probably occurring in January. They may have also hunted the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), which existed in the North Atlantic until at least the early 18th century. Bryant suggests that if gray whales inhabited coastal waters like they do today in the North Pacific they would have been likely targets for Basque whalers, perhaps even more so then the North Atlantic right whale – although most contemporary illustrations and skeletal remains from catches were of the latter species. They may have also caught the occasional sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), as remains of this species were found in the old buildings used to try out the blubber into oil.|$|R
5000|$|Another author {{contends that}} the first mention {{of the use of}} whales by the Basques came in 1059, in which year a measure was passed to {{concentrate}} whale meat in the market of Bayonne. By the year 1150 whaling had spread to the Basque provinces of Spain. In this year King Sancho the Wise of Navarre (r. 1150-94) granted San Sebastián certain privileges. The grant lists various goods that must be paid duties for warehousing, and among this list [...] "boquinas-barbas de ballenas" [...] or plates of whalebone (baleen) held a prominent place. By 1190, whaling had spread to Santander. In 1203, Alfonso VIII of Castile gave Hondarribia the same privileges that had been given to San Sebastian. In 1204, these privileges were extended to Mutriku and Getaria. Similar privileges were given to Zarautz by Ferdinand III of Castile in a royal order dated at Burgos 28 September 1237. This document also states that [...] "in accordance with custom, the King should have a slice of each whale, along the backbone, from the head to the tail". Whaling also spread to Asturias (1232) and finally to Galicia (1371). [...] Up to 49 ports had whaling establishments along the coast from the French Basque country to Cape Finisterre.
