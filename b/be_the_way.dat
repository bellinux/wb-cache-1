25|$|Mearsheimer's {{first book}} Conventional Deterrence (1983) {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how decisions to start a war depend on the projected outcome of military conflict. In other words, how do decision makers' beliefs about the outcome of war affect {{the success or failure of}} deterrence? Mearsheimer's basic argument is that deterrence is likely to work when the potential attacker believes that a successful attack will be unlikely and costly. If the potential attacker, however, has reason to believe the attack will likely succeed and entail low costs, then deterrence is likely to break down. This is now widely accepted to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the principle of deterrence works. Specifically, Mearsheimer argues that the success of deterrence is determined by the strategy available to the potential attacker. He lays out three strategies. First, a war-of-attrition strategy, which entails a high level of uncertainty about the outcome of war and high costs for the attacker. Second, a limited-aims strategy, which entails fewer risks and lower costs. And, third, a blitzkrieg strategy, which provides a way to defeat the enemy rapidly and decisively, with relatively low costs. For Mearsheimer, failures in the modern battlefield are due mostly to the potential attacker's belief that it can successfully implement a blitzkrieg strategy in which tanks and other mechanized forces are employed swiftly to effect a deep penetration and disrupt the enemy's rear. The other two strategies are unlikely to lead to deterrence failures because they would entail a low probability of success accompanied by high costs (war of attrition) or limited gains and the possibility of the conflict turning into a war of attrition (limited aims). If the attacker has a coherent blitzkrieg strategy available, however, an attack is likely to ensue, as its potential benefits outweigh the costs and risks of starting a war.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} U.S. {{version is}} that bin Laden's location at Abbottabad was {{identified by the}} CIA by tracking an al-Qaeda courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Hersh reports that in August 2010 a former senior Pakistani intelligence officer walked into the office of Jonathan Bank, the CIA station chief at the US embassy in Islamabad and betrayed the secret of bin Laden's whereabouts in return {{for part of the}} $25 million reward, and has since been relocated with his family to Washington and is a consultant to the CIA. The ISI had captured bin Laden in 2006; he had lived undetected from 2001 to 2006 with some of his wives and children in the Hindu Kush mountains. The ISI got to him by paying some of the local tribal people to betray him. Bin Laden was very ill and was living as prisoner under ISI control in the garrison town of Abbottabad less than two miles from Pakistan's National Military Academy at Kakul (equivalent of United States Military Academy at West Point). The Saudi government also knew about Osama's presence in Abbottabad and had advised the Pakistanis to keep him as a prisoner and gave financial assistance. Major Amir Aziz, a Pakistani Army doctor, was ordered to move near his compound to provide treatment. Aziz was also given a share of the $25 million reward because he got the DNA sample which conclusively proved that it was bin Laden. A real casualty in the whole affair was the doctor named Shakil Afridi. His perfectly legitimate hepatitis B vaccination programme was claimed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the US obtained bin Laden's DNA. Afridi became the sacrificial lamb because the US wanted to protect its real CIA informant, Amir Aziz, who had been held by the Pakistanis. Afridi was sentenced to 33 years by the Pakistanis. Other vaccination programmes were canceled once this lie was put forth.|$|E

500|$|Usher had {{initially}} planned {{to release the}} album entitled All About U, as his third studio album on October 31, 2000. The album was to follow his successful My Way (1997) which to date, has sold over seven million copies. On March 13, 2000, multiple tracks from the album had leaked on to online music store Napster several months prior to its release, including [...] "T.T.P.", [...] "U R the One" [...] and [...] "Pop Ya Collar". Following the event, the album's release was delayed twice, on December 5, 2000 to July 17, 2001. During the taping of MTV Icon Janet Jackson special, Usher explained that {{he returned to the}} studios to record new songs, stating [...] "I didn't want that to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> my record was remembered or the way I would present that to my fans [...] It turned out a lot better" [...] while adding that tracks that were available for download on the site {{were not going to be}} included on the new album. With new tracks produced, Usher's publicist announced a new name for the album, under the title 8701, who claims that it is [...] "practically a new album". The origin of its new name was initially unknown, with speculation that it subsides with its US release of August 7, 2001 (8/7/01), though Usher's publicist claimed that this was purely coincidental, and was not the reasoning for the title. Usher hinted that it was derived after something significant to him, and he would disclose it in the upcoming months. Eventually, his spokesperson revealed that the '87' segment of the title refers to the year 1987, when Usher sang in public for the first time at his church in Atlanta, with the '01' referring to the year 2001.|$|E

500|$|Between 1850 and 1854 the U. S. Army {{explored}} the lower {{reach of the}} Colorado River from the Gulf of California, looking for the river to provide a less expensive route to supply the remote post of Fort Yuma. [...] First in November 1850 to January 1851, by its transport schooner, Invincible under Captain Alfred H. Wilcox and then by its longboat commanded by Lieutenant George Derby. [...] Later Lieutenant Derby, in his expedition report, recommended that a shallow draft sternwheel steamboat would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to send supplies up river to the fort. [...] The next contractors George Alonzo Johnson with his partner Benjamin M. Hartshorne, brought two barges and 250 tons of supplies arriving at the river's mouth in February 1852, on the United States transport schooner Sierra Nevada under Captain Wilcox. [...] Poling the barges up the Colorado, the first barge sank with its cargo a total loss. [...] The second was finally, after a long struggle poled up to Fort Yuma, but what little it carried was soon consumed by the garrison. [...] Subsequently, wagons again were sent from the fort to haul {{the balance of the}} supplies overland from the estuary through the marshes and woodlands of the Delta. [...] At last Derby's recommendation was heeded and in November 1852, the Uncle Sam, a 65-foot long side-wheel paddle steamer, built by Domingo Marcucci, became the first steamboat on the Colorado River. [...] It was brought by the schooner Capacity from San Francisco to the delta by the next contractor to supply the fort, Captain James Turnbull. [...] It was assembled and launched in the estuary, 30 miles above the mouth of the Colorado River. [...] Equipped with only a 20-horsepower engine, the Uncle Sam could only carry 35 tons of supplies, taking 15 days to make the first 120-mile trip. [...] It made many trips up and down the river, taking four months to finish carrying the supplies for the fort, improving its time up river to 12 days. Negligence caused it to sink at its dock below Fort Yuma, and was then washed away before it could be raised, in the spring flood of 1853. [...] Turnbull in financial difficulty, disappeared. [...] Nevertheless, he had shown the worth of steamboats to solve Fort Yuma's ls supply problem.|$|E
