5|$|Actually, {{the warning}} {{on the early}} flags {{was not meant to}} depict the timber {{rattlesnake}} as being ferocious or the American people as being warlike. The true message was that the citizens of the Colonies were a peaceable and freedom-loving people, but if England’s King George III continued with his oppressive policies toward the Colonies, then they would respond with great wrath. This response would be much like that of a timber rattlesnake, which is peaceable and slow to anger, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> attack aggressively when provoked and will not stop fighting until the enemy retreats.|$|E
5|$|Adenanthos cuneatus {{was taken}} to Great Britain in 1824, and has been grown in {{cultivation}} in Australia and the western United States. Its attractive bronzed or reddish foliage is its main horticultural feature, along with its ability to attract birds to the garden. It requires a well-drained position to do well, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> grow in full sun or semi-shade, and tolerates both sand and gravelly soils. George Lullfitz, a Western Australian nurseryman, recommends growing it as a rambling ground cover in front of other shrubs, or in a rockery.|$|E

5|$|Age of Empires III {{builds on}} and {{introduces}} new features to the Age of Mythology engine, called Bang! Engine. One new {{feature is the}} inclusion of the Havok physics simulation middleware engine on the Windows version and the similar PhysX engine on Mac OS X. This means that many events such as building destruction and tree falls will not be pre-created animations, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> be calculated according to the physics engine, in an innovation for the series. Other graphical features of the game include bloom lighting and support for pixel shader 3.0.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} will occasionally prey {{on large}} mammals, such as deer, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> usually do so when fish and smaller prey levels go down. Rarely, American alligators {{have been observed}} killing and eating bobcats, but such events are not common and have little effect on bobcat populations. Although American alligators have been listed as predators of West Indian manatees, very little evidence exists of such predation. In the 2000s, when invasive Burmese pythons occupied the Everglades, American alligators have been recorded preying on them, possibly controlling populations, thus preventing the invasive species to spread up north.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} the 1960s, Oak Ridge National Laboratory could produce 650grams of {{promethium}} per year and was the world's only large-volume synthesis facility. Gram-scale production of promethium has been discontinued in the U.S. in the early 1980s, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> possibly be resumed after 2010 at the High Flux Isotope Reactor.

Herman drafts the armistice treaty, which states that Nelson will retain his position and name, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> not hold any actual power. Then, Bart and Nelson sign the treaty. Then, Marge enters with cupcakes, and peace prevails.|$|E

Fish that are consumed include Atlantic cod, Greenland turbot, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting.

5|$|Coloured {{gold and}} green, the frogs are {{voracious}} eaters of insects, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> also eat larger prey, such as worms and mice. Unlike most frogs, they are active at day, {{although this is}} mostly to warm in the sun. They {{tend to be less}} active in winter except in warmer or wetter periods, and breed in the warmer months. Males reach maturity after around 9 months, while for the larger females, this does not occur until they are two years old. The frogs can engage in cannibalism, and males frequently attack and injure one another if they infringe on one another's space.|$|E
