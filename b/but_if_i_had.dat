500|$|Clarke {{was never}} {{sure if she}} would finish her novel or {{if it would be}} published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, {{beginning}} at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule. Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together. Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not for the reader, [...] "clung to this method" [...] "because I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning, [...] would lack depth, and I would just be skimming the surface of what I could do. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> known {{it was going to take}} me ten years, I would never have begun. I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year, or the year after next." [...] Clarke and Greenland fell in love while she was writing the novel and moved in together.|$|E

Capcom's Taketoshi Sano said that [...] "Ibuki is suited to {{those who want to}} get the most out of a single character" [...] and [...] "beginners can use her too, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to pick I'd say she's suited for intermediate." [...] Capcom Europe described Ibuki’s [...] "Raida" [...] ("Thunder Strike") command grab as having some unique properties and being one of the most powerful moves in the game. According to an MTV guide, Ibuki is [...] "one of the hardest characters to master in this latest iteration" [...] and players need to gain [...] "a strong understanding of each character's moves and abilities before truly coming to grips with what the weak, yet versatile Ibuki has to offer." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{indicated}} by the title, air, skies and wings are important themes: Yukito is searching for the [...] "girl in the sky", and Misuzu believes that her other self is flying in the sky above her. Other characters show a similar relationship to the sky, such as Minagi {{who is a member}} of the astronomy club,Translated quote: [...] "...There's still club activities...the astronomy club." [...] and Michiru who has a fondness for bubbles that float in the air. Kano wants wings to fly, and Kanna already has them. Misuzu names a crow she finds —Japanese for [...] "sky". Another major theme is the maternal bond, as the four heroines' stories, as well as Yukito's, revolve around their mothers, either biological or adoptive. Main scenario writer Jun Maeda commented that he prefers to include mothers in games if given the choice between only including a mother or a father, as is what happened with Air, though he backs this up by noting that in bishōjo games, women are the main focus anyway. Complicated relationships involving family members and friends play a key part throughout the story. One of the sub-themes in the story is magic.Translated quote: [...] "If you could use sorcery, what do you think would happen?" [...] Uraha, Yukito's mother,Translated quote: [...] "I had inherited the ability to control puppets without touching them from my mother." [...] and Yukito himselfTranslated quote: A power that can move a puppet without touching it.

Kano was told by her sister that when she grows up and takes off her yellow ribbon, she will gain the power to do magic. However, the problems of parents leaving their offspring and poverty are displayed realistically.|$|E
