5|$|Egyptian deities are {{connected}} {{in a complex}} and shifting array of relationships. A god's connections and interactions with other deities helped define its character.

5|$|The {{composition}} of the electrode core is generally similar and sometimes identical {{to that of the}} <b>base</b> <b>material.</b> But even though a number of feasible options exist, a slight difference in alloy composition can strongly impact the properties of the resulting weld. This is especially true of alloy steels such as HSLA steels. Likewise, electrodes of compositions {{similar to those of the}} base materials are often used for welding nonferrous materials like aluminium and copper. However, sometimes it is desirable to use electrodes with core materials significantly different from the <b>base</b> <b>material.</b> For example, stainless steel electrodes are sometimes used to weld two pieces of carbon steel, and are often utilized to weld stainless steel workpieces with carbon steel workpieces.|$|E
5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and <b>base</b> <b>material</b> alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the <b>base</b> <b>material.</b> Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E

5|$|These {{processes}} use a welding {{power supply}} to create and maintain an electric arc between an electrode and the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> to melt metals at the welding point. They can use either direct (DC) or alternating (AC) current, and consumable or non-consumable electrodes. The welding region is sometimes protected by some type of inert or semi-inert gas, known as a shielding gas, and filler material is sometimes used as well.|$|E
5|$|When welding {{dissimilar}} metals, {{the joint}} {{must have an}} accurate fit, with proper gap dimensions and bevel angles. Care {{should be taken to}} avoid melting excessive <b>base</b> <b>material.</b> Pulsed current is particularly useful for these applications, as it helps limit the heat input. The filler metal should be added quickly, and a large weld pool should be avoided to prevent dilution of the base materials.|$|E
5|$|After welding, {{a number}} of {{distinct}} regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the filler metal was laid during the welding process. The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the filler metal used, and its compatibility with the base materials. It is surrounded by the heat-affected zone, the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on the base material's behavior when subjected to heat. The metal {{in this area is}} often weaker than both the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> and the fusion zone, and is also where residual stresses are found.|$|E

5|$|Many {{distinct}} factors {{influence the}} strength of welds and the material around them, including the welding method, the amount and concentration of energy input, the weldability of the <b>base</b> <b>material,</b> filler material, and flux material, {{the design of the}} joint, and the interactions between all these factors. To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} common types of arc welding is {{shielded}} metal arc welding (SMAW); it is also known as manual metal arc welding (MMA) or stick welding. Electric current is used to strike an arc between the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> and consumable electrode rod, which is made of filler material (typically steel) and is covered with a flux that protects the weld area from oxidation and contamination by producing carbon dioxide (CO2) gas during the welding process. The electrode core itself acts as filler material, making a separate filler unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Shallow penetration, another {{detriment}} to weld strength, can {{be addressed}} by decreasing welding speed, increasing the current or using a smaller electrode. Any of these weld-strength-related defects can make the weld prone to cracking, but other factors are involved as well. High carbon, alloy or sulfur content in the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> can lead to cracking, especially if low-hydrogen electrodes and preheating are not employed. Furthermore, the workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual stresses into the weld and can cause cracking as the weld cools and contracts.|$|E

5|$|The {{contracted}} {{period for}} construction was {{planned to be}} around two years, but the timescale was lengthened by nearly 25% due to rainfall that persisted {{throughout much of the}} early construction period. The heavy rainfall in late 1956 had profound effects on the heavy engineering works required to construct the road foundation, resulting in this aspect of work being postponed until early 1957; an extension of five months was granted due to the extraordinary and unforeseen weather conditions. Numerous lessons were learnt from the construction of Britain's first motorway, particularly towards using an appropriately screened <b>base</b> <b>material,</b> with water drainage systems that should be appropriate and fit for purposes, as well as the inclusion of continuous hard shoulders.|$|E
5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E
5|$|Welding is a {{fabrication}} or sculptural {{process that}} joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing fusion, which {{is distinct from}} lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering, which do not melt the base metal. In addition to melting the base metal, a filler material is typically added to the joint to form a pool of molten material (the weld pool) that cools to form a joint that is usually stronger than the <b>base</b> <b>material.</b> Pressure may also be {{used in conjunction with}} heat, or by itself, to produce a weld. Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized.|$|E

50|$|Negative {{bulk modulus}} is {{achieved}} through monopolar resonances of the BWS series. Negative mass density is achieved with dipolar resonances {{of the gold}} sphere series. Rather than rubber spheres in liquid, this is a solid <b>based</b> <b>material.</b> This is also as yet a realization of simultaneously negative bulk modulus and mass density in a solid <b>based</b> <b>material,</b> which is an important distinction.|$|R
5|$|In GMAW {{the primary}} cause of {{porosity}} is gas entrapment in the weld pool, which occurs when the metal solidifies before the gas escapes. The gas can come from impurities in the shielding gas or on the workpiece, as well as from an excessively long or violent arc. Generally, the amount of gas entrapped {{is directly related to the}} cooling rate of the weld pool. Because of its higher thermal conductivity, aluminum welds are especially susceptible to greater cooling rates and thus additional porosity. To reduce it, the workpiece and electrode should be clean, the welding speed diminished and the current set high enough to provide sufficient heat input and stable metal transfer but low enough that the arc remains steady. Preheating can also help reduce the cooling rate in some cases by reducing the temperature gradient between the weld area and the <b>base</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
5|$|Resistance welding {{was also}} {{developed}} during the final decades of the 19th century, with the first patents going to Elihu Thomson in 1885, who produced further advances over the next 15 years. Thermite welding was invented in 1893, and around that time another process, oxyfuel welding, became well established. Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by Edmund Davy, but its use was not practical in welding until about 1900, when a suitable torch was developed. At first, oxyfuel welding {{was one of the}} more popular welding methods due to its portability and relatively low cost. As the 20th century progressed, however, it fell out of favor for industrial applications. It was largely replaced with arc welding, as advances in metal coverings (known as flux) were made. Flux covering the electrode primarily shields the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> from impurities, but also stabilizes the arc and can add alloying components to the weld metal.|$|E

Our model is based on the plastic frictional behaviour of cement <b>based</b> <b>materials</b> and integrates the physical mechanisms that govern material extrusion flow and extrusion force increase. When the process starts, a pressure gradient is created in the extruder due to wall friction of the paste which is submitted to plug flow. It induces a consolidation of the material. As a result, a large increase of extrusion force appears. A Coulomb law is used to model cement <b>based</b> <b>materials</b> which is considered as consolidating granular media. Such modelling is compared with experimental results. Tests were carried out on extrudible cement pastes. Modelling and experimental results are in good agreement.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare {{polymerization}} {{efficiency of}} resin composite <b>basing</b> <b>materials</b> when light-cured through resin composite and {{fiber reinforced composite}} (FRC) by testing microhardness. METHODS: Simulated indirect restorations were prepared by application of resin composite (Clearfil AP-X) or FRC (EverStick) to nylon rings with 1. 5 mm thickness and 8 mm diameter, followed by light-curing. Resin composite <b>basing</b> <b>material</b> (Clearfil Majesty Flow or Clearfil AP-X) was applied to identical rings and light-cured through the simulated indirect restorations with exposure times of 20, 40, or 60 s. Light-curing though a ring without resin material (=no indirect restoration) served as control. For each combination of <b>basing</b> <b>material</b> and indirect restoration 10 specimens were prepared for each exposure time. Top and bottom surface Vickers microhardness numbers (VHNs) of <b>basing</b> <b>materials</b> were recorded after 24 h. RESULTS: After 60 s exposure time, VHNs with indirect FRC were not different from control VHNs, while VHNs with indirect resin composite were significantly lower (p< 0. 001). Linear regression analysis revealed that resin composite <b>basing</b> <b>material</b> used had the greatest effect on top and bottom VHNs (p< 0. 001). The presence of an indirect restoration resulted in decreased VHNs (p< 0. 001), with resin composite resulting in lower VHNs when compared to FRC. Moreover, a longer exposure time resulted in increased VHNs (p< 0. 001). SIGNIFICANCE: Results suggest that polymerization of resin composite <b>basing</b> <b>materials</b> is more effective when light-curing through an FRC than through a resin composite indirect restoration. Prolonging of exposure time, however, is necessary when compared to light-curing without presence of indirect restoration material...|$|R
