5|$|Although van der Weyden did not {{adhere to}} the {{conventions}} of idealisation, he generally sought to flatter his sitters. He depicted his models in highly fashionable clothing, often with rounded—almost sculpted—facial features, some of which deviated from natural representation. He adapted his own aesthetic, and his portraits of women often <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> striking resemblance to each other.|$|E
5|$|Blackbuck <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> close {{resemblance}} to gazelles, and are distinguished mainly {{by the fact}} that while gazelles are brown in the dorsal parts, blackbuck develop a dark brown or black colour in these parts.|$|E
50|$|Completed in 1980, Bear Country {{replaced}} the zoo's historic bear pits originally constructed in 1874. Bear Country currently features four bear species: sloth <b>bears,</b> <b>an</b> Asiatic black <b>bear,</b> <b>an</b> Andean <b>bear,</b> and <b>a</b> rare polar <b>bear.</b>|$|R
50|$|On the vertebrae, the zygosphere {{processes}} are separate, and {{located on a}} distinct foot, or pedicle, of the vertebral arch. In the shoulder girdle, the clavicle is expanded and <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> notch on its interior edge, while the interclavicle <b>bears</b> <b>an</b> expansion on its front end. The scapulocoracoid <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> primary coracoid fenestra, but apparently not a secondary coracoid fenestra. Whether or not it has a scapular fenestra is unclear. On the pubis, the symphysis was rather thin. Unlike all other iguanomorphs, the tibia <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> special notch for articulation with the astragalum-calcaneum.|$|R
5|$|The novel {{follows the}} {{adventure}} of four <b>bears,</b> Kallik (<b>a</b> polar <b>bear),</b> Lusa (<b>a</b> black <b>bear),</b> Toklo (<b>a</b> brown <b>bear)</b> and Ujurak (<b>a</b> brown <b>bear).</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1251, the sheriffs {{were ordered}} to pay fourpence a day towards the upkeep for the King's polar <b>bear,</b> <b>a</b> gift from Haakon IV of Norway in the same year; the bear {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention from Londoners when it went fishing in the Thames while tied to the land by a chain.|$|E
5|$|In a stanza Vafþrúðnismál, Odin asks Vafþrúðnir {{from where}} another sun {{will come from}} once Fenrir has assailed the current sun. Vafþrúðnir {{responds}} in a further stanza, stating that before Álfröðull (Sól) is assailed by Fenrir, she will <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> daughter who will ride on her mother's paths after the events of Ragnarök.|$|E
5|$|In the stanza {{that follows}} Vafþrúðnir {{responds}} that Sól (here {{referred to as}} Álfröðull) will <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> daughter before Fenrir attacks her, and that this daughter shall continue the paths of her deceased mother through the heavens.|$|E
25|$|Once <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> claims <b>an</b> animal carcass, {{it becomes}} very {{protective}} of its kill. This becomes a problem when <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> claims <b>a</b> hunter's kill, as the hunter may not wish to kill the bear as well. By avoiding <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> over <b>a</b> carcass, the risk of attack is reduced by around fifty percent.|$|R
25|$|The Quivirans {{apparently}} {{called their}} land Tancoa (which <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> {{resemblance to the}} later sub-tribe called Tawakoni) and a neighboring province on the Smoky Hill River was called Tabas (which <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> resemblance to the sub-tribe of Taovayas).|$|R
50|$|In 1946, the Allied {{headquarters}} {{published a}} series of stamps, the so-called „Bärenmarken“, {{for the whole of}} Berlin. The graphic designers Alfred Goldhammer and Heinz Schwalbe created four images with symbols of the reconstruction, e.g. <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> with <b>a</b> brick, <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> with <b>a</b> shovel, <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> with <b>a</b> beam and a young oak tree in front of the ruins at Belle-Alliance square.|$|R
5|$|The CGS {{system had}} two units of energy, the erg that {{was related to}} {{mechanics}} and the calorie that was related to thermal energy; so {{only one of them}} (the erg) could <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> coherent relationship to the base units. Coherence was a design aim of SI resulting in only one unit of energy being defined – the joule.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the initial}} description, the eye socket of Euchambersia is rather small. The {{branches}} of the postorbital and jugal that usually surround the back {{and bottom of the}} eye socket in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced or absent entirely. Meanwhile, the top of the eye socket is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> pineal foramen. Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, further {{to the side of the}} jaw, by any sort of opening.|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test, as a classification can still <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E

5|$|Ants form {{symbiotic}} {{associations with}} a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.|$|E
5|$|As for the Harii, {{quite apart}} from their strength, which exceeds {{that of the other}} tribes I have just listed, they pander to their innate savagery by skill and timing: with black shields and painted bodies, they choose dark nights to fight, and by means of terror and shadow of a ghostly army they cause panic, since no enemy can <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> sight so {{unexpected}} and hellish; in every battle the eyes are the first to be conquered.|$|E
5|$|Being a {{foreigner}} {{and possibly a}} hetaera, Aspasia was free of the legal restraints that traditionally confined married women to their homes, and thereby was allowed {{to participate in the}} public life of the city. She became the mistress of the statesman Pericles in the early 440s. After he divorced his first wife (c. 445 BC), Aspasia began to live with him, although her marital status remains disputed. Their son, Pericles the Younger, must have been born by 440 BC. Aspasia would have to have been quite young, if she were able to <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> child to Lysicles c. 428 BC.|$|E
50|$|Billy Two Moons - Stereotypical Native American {{character}} {{who is a}} fugitive from the U.S. government. He <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> resemblance {{to the character of}} Billy Jack. The Mortal Kombat 3 character Nightwolf also <b>bears</b> <b>a</b> resemblance, even lifting a few of Billy's moves for his own.|$|R

5|$|Both of the Russian Toy {{varieties}} can be {{crossed and}} produce smooth- and long-coated puppies {{from the same}} litter. In addition, when two smooth-coated dogs are bred together, they may occasionally <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> long-coated offspring if the long hair gene is present in their pedigrees. However, {{there have been no}} records of two long-coated Russian Toys breeding together and producing smooth-coated offspring.|$|E
5|$|Dromedaries {{are mainly}} active during {{daylight}} hours. They form herds of about 20 individuals, which {{are led by}} a dominant male. This camel feeds on foliage and desert vegetation; several adaptations, {{such as the ability}} to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, allow it to thrive in its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> single calf after a gestation of 15 months.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez would <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> harsh {{change of}} fortune: after one more {{influential}} success in November 1792 at Jemappes, {{he was by}} the following year a broken man. His army had suffered such catastrophic losses that he defected to the royalist side {{for the rest of}} his life. Kellermann, however, continued in a long and distinguished military career. In 1808 he was ennobled by Napoleon and became Duke of Valmy.|$|E

5|$|Each somite, or body segment can <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> pair of appendages: on the {{segments}} of the head, these include two pairs of antennae, the mandibles and maxillae; the thoracic segments bear legs, which may be specialised as pereiopods (walking legs) and maxillipeds (feeding legs). The abdomen bears pleopods, and ends in a telson, which bears the anus, and is often flanked by uropods to form a tail fan. The number and variety of appendages in different crustaceans may be {{partly responsible for the}} group's success.|$|E
5|$|Extant {{bears are}} found in sixty {{countries}} primarily in the Northern Hemisphere and are concentrated in Asia, North America, and Europe. An exception is the spectacled bear; native to South America, it inhabits the Andean region. The sun bear's range extends below the equator in Southeast Asia. The Atlas <b>bear,</b> <b>a</b> subspecies of the brown bear was distributed in North Africa from Morocco to Libya, but it became extinct around the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|In Damascus, Syria, {{a team of}} men {{excavate}} a {{piece of}} petrified wood—the True Cross. They are interrupted {{by the arrival of}} two armed assailants; one of the excavators, Le Fur, clutches the wood as a shield, and the attackers' guns jam when they attempt to fire on him. However, when Le Fur attempts to smuggle the wood out of the country, he is killed by a bomb at the airport and the cross is taken by a man named Helmut Gunsche. Gunsche later calls his employer, Rudolf Axmann, to inform him of the theft; Axmann's cufflinks <b>bear</b> <b>a</b> Germanic rune.|$|E
