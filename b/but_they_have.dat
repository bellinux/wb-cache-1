These {{types are}} humans {{born with a}} tail, and they can shape shift like a {{werewolf}} <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> control over their transformation. Their entire power is kept in their tail. In undeath, the pricolici remain in their wolf form.|$|E

Examples are diazepam, clorazepate, chlordiazepoxide, and flurazepam.|$|E

5|$|Renewable energy {{targets in}} most {{countries}} are indicative and nonbinding <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> assisted government actions and regulatory frameworks.

5|$|Styloolithus, another fossil enantiornithine egg {{from the}} Gobi, differs from Gobioolithus {{in that it}} is larger and has a thicker eggshell with a proportionately smaller mammillary layer. Laevisoolithids, which are also eggs of enantiornithines, are also larger than Gobioolithus, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a much thicker mammillary layer.|$|E

5|$|Altogether, around fifty Christian {{artifacts}} {{were found}} in Hasekura's estate in 1640, such as crosses, rosaries, religious gowns and religious paintings. The artifacts were seized and stored by the Date fief. An inventory was made again in 1840 describing the items as belonging to Hasekura Tsunenaga. Nineteen books were also mentioned in the inventory, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been lost since. The artifacts are today preserved in the Sendai City Museum and other museums in Sendai.|$|E
5|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that the plant may be mildly toxic. The noxious odours have been associated with nausea and headaches, as well as with contact dermatitis reported in both humans and sheep, who also developed weakness and paralysis. It contains a quinone irritant, 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, as well as active quassinoids (ailanthone itself being one) which may account for these effects, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have,</b> however, proved difficult or impossible to reproduce in humans and goats. In one trial a tincture from the blossom and foliage caused nausea, vomiting and muscular relaxation.|$|E
5|$|As a group, {{the house}} martins cannot easily be {{confused}} with any other swallows. Four species of the genus Tachycineta have white rumps and underparts, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> bright metallic green or blue-green upperparts, longer tails, and are restricted to Central and South America. The variable plumages of the South Asian species and a confused taxonomic history has left their distribution ranges in doubt.|$|E

5|$|Following Maldacena's insight in 1997, {{theorists have}} {{discovered}} many different realizations of the AdS/CFT correspondence. These relate various conformal field theories to compactifications of string theory and M-theory in various numbers of dimensions. The theories involved {{are generally not}} viable models of the real world, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> certain features, such as their particle content or high degree of symmetry, which make them useful for solving problems in quantum field theory and quantum gravity.|$|E
