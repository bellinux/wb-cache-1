50|$|Particular {{care must}} be taken when {{designing}} systems with bussed signals which are wired to more than one hot-swap component. When a hot-swap component is inserted its input and output signal pins will represent a temporary short-circuit to ground.

One common design solution is to protect bussed signal pins with series diodes or resistors. CMOS <b>buffer</b> <b>devices</b> are now available with specialized inputs and outputs that minimize disturbance of bussed signals during the hot-swap operation.

40|$|A new {{configuration}} of voltage-mode quadrature sinusoidal oscillator is proposed. The proposed oscillator employs two voltage differencing current conveyors (VDCCs), two resistors, and two grounded capacitors.

Experimental {{characterization}} of 4 H-SiC power MESFETs with n implanted source/drain ohmic contact regions, {{with and without}} a p-buffer layer, fabricated on semi-insulating (SI) substrates exhibited hysteresis (looping) in the drain I-V characteristics of both types of devices at 300 K and 480 K due to traps.

40|$|Gait {{planning}} {{is an important}} basis for the walking of a legged robot. To improve the walking stability of multi-legged robots and to reduce the impact force between the foot and the ground, gait planning strategies are presented for an electrically driven large-load-ratio six-legged robot. First, the configuration and walking gait of the electrically driven large-load-ratio six-legged robot are designed. The higher-stable swing sequences of legs and typical walking modes are respectively obtained. Based on the Denavit–Hartenberg (D–H) method, the analyses of the forward and inverse kinematics are implemented. The mathematical models of the articulated rotation angles are respectively established. In view of the <b>buffer</b> <b>device</b> installed {{at the end of}} shin to decrease the impact force between the foot and the ground, an initial lift height of the leg is brought into gait planning when the support phase changes into the transfer phase.

Thus, approximately 10 kHz output rate have to be provided while feeding ~ 1 kByte data packets with 100 kHz at the input. The evaluated implementation of this readout buffer should be based on commercial "of-the-shelf" hardware. Thus a conventional Linux server PC with four PCI Bus segments has been used. This approach leads to uniformity in the ATLAS data acquisition system because all hardware beginning with the second trigger level is built of similar PCs. But a standard PC is not able to meet the previously mentioned requirements. Therefore it is extended (or accelerated) by a number of PCI based FPGA co-processor boards. Considering the above mentioned sequential selection and RoI concept, such a complex buffer component based on standard server PCs and FPGA co-processors has never been investigated before in high energy physics. The FPGA co-processor is a simple component extending the PC for the time critical receiving and buffering of data. It is able to process data from four ATLAS detector links which allows the grouping of 12 to 16 links in one PC. Measurements show that this system is able to sustain the ATLAS requirements. Currently Linux OS, running on the PC system and handling the Gigabit Ethernet network I/O {{with the rest of the}} data acquisition system, is the main bottleneck.
