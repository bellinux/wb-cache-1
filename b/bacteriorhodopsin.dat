5|$|Green {{is common}} in nature, as many plants are green because of a complex {{chemical}} known as chlorophyll, which is involved in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green. Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis. Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using <b>bacteriorhodopsin.</b> The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria.|$|E
5|$|Phototrophic archaea use {{light to}} produce {{chemical}} {{energy in the}} form of ATP. In the Halobacteria, light-activated ion pumps like <b>bacteriorhodopsin</b> and halorhodopsin generate ion gradients by pumping ions out of the cell across the plasma membrane. The energy stored in these electrochemical gradients is then converted into ATP by ATP synthase. This process is a form of photophosphorylation. The ability of these light-driven pumps to move ions across membranes depends on light-driven changes in the structure of a retinol cofactor buried {{in the center of the}} protein.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of receptors with known structures, transmembrane alpha helices constitute most of the transmembrane component. In certain receptors, such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the transmembrane domain forms a protein pore through the membrane, or around the ion channel. Upon activation of an extracellular domain by binding of the appropriate ligand, the pore becomes accessible to ions, which then diffuse. In other receptors, the transmembrane domains undergo a conformational change upon binding, which effects intracellular conditions. In some receptors, such {{as members of the}} 7TM superfamily, the transmembrane domain includes a ligand binding pocket. <b>Bacteriorhodopsin</b> is an example, the detailed structure of which has been determined by crystallography.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{structural}} {{models for}} GPCRs {{were based on}} their weak analogy to <b>bacteriorhodopsin,</b> for which a structure had been determined by both electron diffraction ( [...] , [...] ) and X ray-based crystallography (...) [...] In 2000, the first crystal structure of a mammalian GPCR, that of bovine rhodopsin (...) , was solved. [...] While the main feature, the seven-transmembrane helices, is conserved, the relative orientation of the helices differ significantly from that of <b>bacteriorhodopsin.</b> [...] In 2007, the first structure of a human GPCR was solved ( [...] , [...] ). This was followed immediately by a higher resolution structure of the same receptor (...) [...] This human β2-adrenergic receptor GPCR structure proved highly similar to the bovine rhodopsin {{in terms of the}} relative orientation of the seven-transmembrane helices. [...] However, the conformation of the second extracellular loop is entirely different between the two structures. [...] Since this loop constitutes the [...] "lid" [...] that covers the top of the ligand binding site, this conformational difference highlights the difficulties in constructing homology models of other GPCRs based only on the rhodopsin structure.|$|E
2500|$|It is also {{important}} to properly define the unfolded state. The unfolded state of membrane proteins in detergent micelles is different from that in the thermal denaturation experiments. This state represents a combination of folded hydrophobic α-helices and partially unfolded segments covered by the detergent. For example, the [...] "unfolded" [...] <b>bacteriorhodopsin</b> in SDS micelles has four transmembrane α-helices folded, {{while the rest of the}} protein is situated at the micelle-water interface and can adopt different types of non-native amphiphilic structures. Free energy differences between such detergent-denatured and native states are similar to stabilities of water-soluble proteins (< 10 kcal/mol).|$|E
2500|$|Refolding of α-helical transmembrane {{proteins}} in vitro is technically difficult. There are relatively {{few examples of}} the successful refolding experiments, as for <b>bacteriorhodopsin.</b> In vivo, all such proteins are normally folded co-translationally within the large transmembrane translocon. The translocon channel provides a highly heterogeneous environment for the nascent transmembane α-helices. A relatively polar amphiphilic α-helix can adopt a transmembrane orientation in the translocon (although {{it would be at}} the membrane surface or unfolded in vitro), because its polar residues can face [...] the central water-filled channel of the translocon. Such mechanism is necessary for incorporation of polar α-helices into structures of transmembrane proteins. The amphiphilic helices remain attached to the translocon until the protein is completely synthesized and folded. If the protein remains unfolded and attached to the translocon for too long, it is degraded by specific [...] "quality control" [...] cellular systems.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{microbes}} (phototrophs) {{are capable}} of using light {{as a source of}} energy to produce ATP and organic compounds such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. [...] Of these, algae are particularly significant because they are oxygenic, using water as an electron donor for electron transfer during photosynthesis. [...] Phototrophic bacteria are found in the phyla Cyanobacteria, Chlorobi, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes. Along with plants these microbes are responsible for all biological generation of oxygen gas on Earth. Because chloroplasts were derived from a lineage of the Cyanobacteria, the general principles of metabolism in these endosymbionts can also be applied to chloroplasts. In addition to oxygenic photosynthesis, many bacteria can also photosynthesize anaerobically, typically using sulfide (...) as an electron donor to produce sulfate. [...] Inorganic sulfur (...) , thiosulfate (...) and ferrous iron (...) can also be used by some organisms. [...] Phylogenetically, all oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria are Cyanobacteria, while anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria belong to the purple bacteria (Proteobacteria), Green sulfur bacteria (e.g. Chlorobium), Green non-sulfur bacteria (e.g. Chloroflexus), or the heliobacteria (Low %G+C Gram positives). [...] In addition to these organisms, some microbes (e.g. the Archaeon Halobacterium or the bacterium Roseobacter, among others) can utilize light to produce energy using the enzyme <b>bacteriorhodopsin,</b> a light-driven proton pump. However, there are no known Archaea that carry out photosynthesis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bacteriorhodopsin</b> {{belongs to}} the {{microbial}} rhodopsins. They have similarities to vertebrate rhodopsins, the pigments that sense light in the retina. Rhodopsins also contain retinal; however, the functions of rhodopsin and <b>bacteriorhodopsin</b> are different, and there is limited similarity in their amino acid sequences. Both rhodopsin and <b>bacteriorhodopsin</b> belong to the 7TM receptor family of proteins, but rhodopsin is a G protein-coupled receptor and <b>bacteriorhodopsin</b> is not. In the first use of electron crystallography to obtain an atomic-level protein structure, the structure of <b>bacteriorhodopsin</b> was resolved in 1990. It was then used as a template to build models of G protein-coupled receptors before crystallographic structures were also available for these proteins.|$|E
5000|$|Proteorhodopsin {{belongs to}} a family of similar retinylidene proteins, most similar to its archeal homologes halorhodopsin and <b>bacteriorhodopsin.</b> Sensory Rhodopsin was {{discovered}} by Franz Christian Boll in 1876. <b>Bacteriorhodopsin</b> was discovered in 1971 and named in 1973 and is currently only known {{to exist in the}} archea domain, not bacteria. [...] Halorhodopsin was first discovered and named in 1977. <b>Bacteriorhodopsin</b> and Halorhodopsin both only exist in the Archea domain whereas proteorhodopsin spans bacteria, archea, and eukaryotes. Proteorhodopsin shares seven transmembrane α-helicies retinal covalently linked by a Schiff base mechanism to a lysine residue in the seventh helix (helix G). <b>Bacteriorhodopsin,</b> like proteorhodopsin, is a light-driven proton pump. Sensory Rhodopsin is a G-coupled protein involved in sight.|$|E
50|$|In {{comparison}} with its better-known archaeal homolog <b>bacteriorhodopsin,</b> {{most of the}} active site residues of known importance to the <b>bacteriorhodopsin</b> mechanism are conserved in proteorhodopsin. Sequence similarity is not significantly conserved however, from either halo- or bacterio- rhodopsin. Homologues of the active site residues Arg82, Asp85 (the primary proton acceptor), Asp212 and Lys216 (the retinal Schiff base binding site) in <b>bacteriorhodopsin</b> are conserved as Arg94, Asp97, Asp227 and Lys231 in proteorhodopsin. However, in proteorhodopsin, there are no carboxylic acid residues directly homologous to Glu194 or Glu204 of <b>bacteriorhodopsin</b> (or Glu 108 and 204 depending on the bacRhodopsin variant), which {{are thought to be}} involved in the proton release pathway at the extracellular surface. However, Asp97 and Arg94 may replace this functionality without the close residue proximity as in <b>bacteriorhodopsin.</b> The department of chemistry at Syracuse University decisevely showed Asp97 cannot be the proton release group as the release happened at forcing conditions under which the aspartic acid group remained protonated.|$|E
50|$|Rhodopsins {{found in}} prokaryotes and algae {{commonly}} contain an all-trans retinal isomer {{at the ground}} state that isomerizes to 13-cis upon light activation, also known as microbial-type chromophore. Examples are bacterial sensory rhodopsins, channelrhodopsin, <b>bacteriorhodopsin,</b> halorhodopsin, and proteorhodopsin. They act as light-gated ion channels and can be further distinguished {{by the type of}} ion they channel. <b>Bacteriorhodopsin</b> functions as a proton pump, whereas halorhodopsin act as a chloride pump. Their functions range from bacterial photosynthesis (<b>bacteriorhodopsin)</b> to driving phototaxis (channelrhodopsins in flagellates). Signal transduction in phototaxis involves depolarization of the cell membrane.|$|E

50|$|Proteorhodopsin {{functions}} {{throughout the}} Earth's oceans as a light-driven H+ pump, by a mechanism {{similar to that}} of <b>bacteriorhodopsin.</b> As in <b>bacteriorhodopsin,</b> the retinal chromophore of proteorhodopsin is covalently bound to the apoprotein via a protonated Schiff base at Lys231. The configuration of the retinal chromophore in unphotolyzed proteorhodopsin is predominantly all-trans, and isomerizes to 13-cis upon illumination with light. Several models of the complete proteorhodopsin photocycle have been proposed, based on FTIR and UV-visible spectroscopy; they resemble established photocycle models for <b>bacteriorhodopsin.</b> Complete proteorhodopsin based photosystems have been discovered and expressed in E. coli, giving them additional light mediated energy gradient capability for ATP generation without external need for retinal or precursors; with the PR, gene five other proteins code for the photopigment biosynthetic pathyway.|$|E

50|$|Most {{residues}} {{participating in}} the trimerization are not conserved in <b>bacteriorhodopsin,</b> a homologous protein capable of forming a trimeric structure {{in the absence of}} bacterioruberin. Despite a large alteration in the amino acid sequence, the shape of the intratrimer hydrophobic space filled by lipids is highly conserved between archaerhodopsin-2 and <b>bacteriorhodopsin.</b> Since a transmembrane helix facing this space undergoes a large conformational change during the proton pumping cycle, it is feasible that trimerization is an important strategy to capture special lipid components that are relevant to the protein activity.|$|E

5000|$|Rhodopsin was {{originally}} {{a synonym for}} [...] "visual purple", a visual pigment (light-sensitive molecule) found in the retinas of frogs and other vertebrates, used for dim-light vision, and usually found in rod cells. This is still the meaning of rhodopsin in the narrow sense. In the broad sense, rhodopsin refers to any molecule consisting of an opsin and a chromophore (generally a variant of retinal). The term bacterial rhodopsin originally referred to the first microbial rhodopsin discovered, known today as <b>bacteriorhodopsin.</b> The first <b>bacteriorhodopsin</b> {{turned out to be}} of archaeal origin, from Halobacterium salinarum. Since then, other microbial rhodopsins have been discovered, rendering the term bacterial rhodopsin ambiguous.|$|E
50|$|All-trans-retinal {{is also an}} {{essential}} component of type I, or microbial, opsins such as <b>bacteriorhodopsin,</b> channelrhodopsin, and halorhodopsin. In these molecules, light causes the all-trans-retinal to become 13-cis retinal, which then cycles back to all-trans-retinal in the dark state.|$|E
50|$|The {{proteins}} from halobacteria include <b>bacteriorhodopsin</b> and archaerhodopsin, {{which are}} light-driven proton pumps; halorhodopsin, a light-driven chloride pump; and sensory rhodopsin, which mediates both photoattractant (in the red) and photophobic (in the ultra-violet) responses.

50|$|The way <b>bacteriorhodopsin</b> {{generates a}} proton {{gradient}} in Archaea {{is through a}} proton pump. The proton pump relies on proton carriers to drive protons {{from the side of}} the membrane with a low H+ concentration to the side of the membrane with a high H+ concentration. In <b>bacteriorhodopsin,</b> the proton pump is activated by absorption of photons of 568 nm wavelength which leads to isomerization of the Schiff base (SB) in retinal forming the K state. This moves SB away from Asp85 and Asp212, causing H+ transfer from the SB to Asp85 forming the M1 state. The protein then shifts to the M2 state by separating Glu204 from Glu194 which releases a proton from Glu204 into the external medium. The SB is reprotonated by Asp96 which forms the N state. It is important that the second proton comes from Asp96 since its deprotonated state is unstable and rapidly reprotonated with a proton from the cytosol. The protonation of Asp85 and Asp96 causing re-isomerization of the SB forming the O state. Finally, <b>bacteriorhodopsin</b> returns to its resting state when Asp85 releases its proton to Glu204.|$|E
