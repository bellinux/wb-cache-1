50|$|Streptomyces bangladeshensis is a {{thermophilic}} bacterium species from the genus of Streptomyces {{which has been}} isolated from soil in Natore in Bangladesh. Streptomyces bangladeshensis produces <b>bis(2-ethylhexyl)</b> <b>phthalate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Almost all 2-ethylhexanol {{manufactured}} {{is used as}} {{a precursor}} for the synthesis of the diester <b>bis(2-ethylhexyl)</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DEHP), a plasticizer. Because it is a fatty alcohol, its esters tend to have emollient properties. For example, the sunscreen octocrylene contains a 2-ethylhexyl ester for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bis(2-ethylhexyl)</b> <b>phthalate</b> (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, diethylhexyl phthalate, DEHP; dioctyl phthalate, DOP) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C6H4(C8H17COO)2. DEHP {{is the most}} common member of the class of phthalates which are used as plasticizers. It is the diester of phthalic acid and the branched-chain 2-ethylhexanol. This colorless viscous liquid is soluble in oil, but not in water. Accounting for an almost 54% market share in 2010, DEHP is a high production volume chemical.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife in {{the area}} has {{suffered}} significant damage due to the on- and off-shore garbage. Fishing debris, such as discarded fishing nets and lines, drowns, strangles, and traps birds and marine mammals.Some types of plastic and their constituents, such as bisphenol A, <b>bis(2-ethylhexyl)</b> <b>phthalate,</b> and polystyrene, leach carcinogenic or poisonous chemicals when they break down. Others absorb toxins such as DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls from their surroundings. These toxins are absorbed by animals when consumed.|$|E
50|$|Phthalates {{are mainly}} found as {{softeners}} in plastics, but also perfumes, nail varnish and other cosmetics. Fetuses that {{are exposed to}} a mixture of phthalates in utero may show signs of disrupted reproductive development. When Di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), <b>Bis(2-ethylhexyl)</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DEHP) and di-n-pentyl phthalate (DPP) were combined, reductions in both testosterone synthesis and gene expression of steroidogenic pathway proteins were seen. The results in male rats were undescended testes and abnormal development of reproductive tissues.|$|E
50|$|Certain flavorings contain {{diacetyl}} and acetyl propionyl {{which give}} a buttery taste. Diacetyl and acetyl propionyl {{are associated with}} bronchiolitis obliterans. A 2015 review recommended for specific regulation of diacetyl and acetyl propionyl in e-liquid, which are safe when ingested but {{have been associated with}} respiratory harm when inhaled. Both diacetyl and acetyl-propionyl have been found in concentrations above those recommended by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Diacetyl is normally found at lower levels in e-cigarettes than in traditional cigarettes. Concerns exist that the flavors and additives in e-cigarettes might lead to diseases, including the popcorn lung. The cardiovascular effects, including a vast range of flavorings and fragrances, is unknown. The irritants butyl acetate, diethyl carbonate, benzoic acid, quinoline, <b>bis(2-ethylhexyl)</b> <b>phthalate,</b> and 2,6-dimethyl phenol were present as undeclared ingredients in the e-liquid. The precise ingredients of e-cigarettes are not known.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{an expert}} panel has {{concluded}} that there is [...] "insufficient evidence" [...] that they can harm the reproductive system of infants, California,Washington state and Europe have banned them from toys. One phthalate, <b>bis(2-ethylhexyl)</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DEHP), used in medical tubing, catheters and blood bags, may harm sexual development in male infants. [...] In 2002, the Food and Drug Administration released a public report which cautioned against exposing male babies to DEHP. Although there are no direct human studies the FDA report states: [...] "Exposure to DEHP has produced a range of adverse effects in laboratory animals, but of greatest concern are effects {{on the development of}} the male reproductive system and production of normal sperm in young animals. In view of the available animal data, precautions should be taken to limit the exposure of the developing male to DEHP". Similarly, phthalates may play a causal role in disrupting masculine neurological development when exposed prenatally.|$|E
5000|$|Tomatis {{focused on}} the IARC monographs which rate chemical's carcinogenicity, and cited several cases in his 2002 critique. In 1998 a panel voted 17-13 to rate 1,3-butadiene a carcinogen. A second vote which Tomatis called [...] "highly irregular" [...] {{occurred}} after [...] "industry observers schmoozed with the panelists and one panelist left the meeting", and a 15-14 vote downgraded the chemical to a [...] "possible carcinogen". Joan Denton, director of California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, made accusations in relation to styrene in 2002, and Michael Jacobsen of the Center for Science in the Public Interest criticized the inclusion of industry observers in a saccharin panel, who were allowed to vote. Tomatis has also highlighted <b>Bis(2-ethylhexyl)</b> <b>phthalate.</b> [...] In defense of the IARC, Kleihues noted that only 17 of 410 of the working-group participants were consultants to industry and these people never served as chairs. He said that [...] "people who receive funds from affected agencies do not vote", and further noted that industry-funded scientists are important because industry often funds studies.|$|E
