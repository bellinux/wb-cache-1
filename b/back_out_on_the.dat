5|$|When her son Jackson turned 14, Smith {{decided to}} move back to New York. After the impact of these deaths, her friends Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Allen Ginsberg (whom she had known since her early years in New York) urged her to go <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road. She toured briefly with Bob Dylan in December 1995 (chronicled in a book of {{photographs}} by Stipe).|$|E
5|$|After Duquesne lost to Saint Bonaventure, the Bonnies {{also lost}} their final regular season game to Xavier, which left {{the two teams}} in a tie for the eighth seed and the home tournament game that went with it. The two teams had played each other twice during the season, with each team taking one victory, so the second tiebreaker came down to who had scored the best victory. Duquesne's best win came against Charlotte, while Saint Bonaventure's was against Rhode Island. Unfortunately, those two teams were also in a tie. So for Duquesne to get their home game, Charlotte had to win their final home game, and Rhode Island had to lose. Both teams lost, so the tie {{remained}} and Rhode Island won out due to their head-to-head records. Thus Duquesne would head <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road against the Bonnies.|$|E
5|$|Hearts {{started the}} match as the {{brighter}} {{of the two}} teams. Rudi Skácel headed wide early on from an Andrew Driver cross. Hearts took the lead through Darren Barr in the 15th minute, scoring from close range. Hearts continued to control the match and Pa Kujabi picked up a booking for fouling Suso Santana. Skácel then doubled Hearts' lead after receiving {{the ball on the}} edge of the area and turning to hit a shot which deflected off James McPake before going in. Hibs then had an opportunity as Kujabi's cross came to Garry O'Connor, but he hit his shot over the bar. McPake then made a goal-line clearance from a Suso shot which had beaten Hibs' keeper Mark Brown. McPake got Hibs back into the game from a corner. Tom Soares' initial delivery was cleared but he got the ball <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wing and put in a low cross which McPake converted.|$|E

500|$|Duquesne {{found itself}} in {{overtime}} once again as they dropped another game against the St. Louis Billikens in double overtime, 75–79. Melquan Bolding suffered another setback as he sat {{out most of the}} game, playing only five minutes due to strep throat. The team then went <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road to face the Rhode Island Rams, where they again lost with a final score of 67–75, dropping their conference record to 0–4. Bill Clark missed a game {{for the first time in}} his college career due to a suspension on suspicion of a [...] "secondary NCAA rules violation." [...] Melquan Bolding started the game for the first time since his injury, but only scored 6 points.|$|E

He finds Sarah again and this time she takes him in, but with reservations. Charlie finds Eddie at Sarah's and tries to persuade him to go <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road. Eddie refuses and Charlie realizes he plans to challenge Fats again. Eddie realizes that Charlie held out his percentage and becomes enraged, believing that with that money he could have rebounded to beat Fats. Eddie dismisses Charlie as a scared old man and tells him to [...] "go lie down and die" [...] by himself.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1986, {{following}} his departure from rehab, Vaughan moved {{back into his}} mother's Glenfield Avenue house in Dallas, which is where he {{had spent much of}} his childhood. During this time, Double Trouble began rehearsals for the Live Alive tour. Although Vaughan was nervous about performing after achieving sobriety, he received positive reassurance. Wynans later recalled: [...] "Stevie was real worried about playing after he'd gotten sober...he didn't know if he had anything left to offer. Once we got <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road, he was very inspired and motivated." [...] The tour began on November 23 at Towson State University, which was Vaughan's first performance with Double Trouble after rehab. On December 31, 1986, they played a concert at Atlanta's Fox Theatre, which featured encore performances with Lonnie Mack.|$|E
