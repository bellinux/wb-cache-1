50|$|A {{soldering}} copper {{is a tool}} with a {{large copper}} head and a long handle which is heated in a blacksmith's forge fire and used to apply heat to sheet metal <b>for</b> <b>soldering.</b> Typical soldering coppers have heads weighing between one and four pounds.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the uniaxial flow curve <b>for</b> <b>solder</b> balls in a flip-chip from experimental-computational algorithms based on finite element modeling (FEM) of in-plane thermal displacement data measured by electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI). In order to measure the deformation of such tiny components as the solder balls in the flip-chip, the spatial resolution of ESPI was increased to submicron scale by magnifying the areas studied. The flow curve <b>for</b> <b>solder</b> balls in the flip-chip was determined by the algorithm, which effectively matches the simulated solder deformation by FEM to the measured deformation by ESPI. The algorithms were applied to Sn- 36 Pb- 2 Ag flip-chip solder balls.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a new {{alloying}} method <b>for</b> <b>solders</b> by using a metal organic modified flux in solder pastes. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the impact of six metal organic compounds (Co, Fe, Al; stearate, oxalate, citrate) on the melting and solidification behaviour in comparison to the revealed microstructure. Findings - It could be shown that Co and Al influence the supercooling whereas Fe exhibits no effect. Co reduces the supercooling of the cast of about 10 K and affects the nucleation. Al retards the solidification up to 185 degrees C. Doping of the solder by flux containing metal organic compounds is successful and the alloying elements Co and Fe are found in the microstructure. Research limitations/implications This paper provides a starting-point for the new alloying method so far only fluxes <b>for</b> <b>solder</b> pastes have been investigated. Originality/value - The reactive alloying method enables the use of new alloying elements <b>for</b> <b>solder</b> pastes in unmodified soldering processes...|$|R
40|$|Soldering of {{packaged}} {{electronic components}} using industry standard Sn-Ag-Cu (SAC) lead-free solders on low-cost foils, {{which are often}} the substrate of choice for flexible electronics, is challenging. This is mainly originating {{from the fact that}} the reflow temperatures of these solder alloys are normally higher than the maximum processing temperature of the low-cost flex foils. To enable component integration on the low-cost foils a novel method <b>for</b> <b>soldering</b> has been introduced by Holst Centre as an alternative to oven reflow, termed 'photonic soldering'. In this method high intensity photonic flashes are used to deliver the thermal energy required <b>for</b> <b>soldering.</b> By taking advantage of the selectivity of light absorption, the required energy <b>for</b> <b>soldering</b> is delivered to the components and circuit tracks while excessive heating of the foils is avoided. This paper presents successful photonic flash soldering of packaged LED components on low-cost polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foils using conventional SAC solders as a demonstration of the capabilities of this novel soldering technology...|$|R

25|$|Tin-based solders readily {{dissolve}} gold, forming brittle intermetallics; for Sn-Pb alloys {{the critical}} concentration of gold to embrittle the joint is about 4%. Indium-rich solders (usually indium-lead) are more suitable <b>for</b> <b>soldering</b> thicker gold layer as the dissolution rate {{of gold in}} indium is much slower. Tin-rich solders also readily dissolve silver; <b>for</b> <b>soldering</b> silver metallization or surfaces, alloys with addition of silvers are suitable; tin-free alloys are also a choice, though their wettability is poorer. If the soldering time is long enough to form the intermetallics, the tin surface of a joint soldered to gold is very dull.|$|R
