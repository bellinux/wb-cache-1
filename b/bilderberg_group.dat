500|$|Deus Ex {{takes place}} in an {{unspecified}} near future in an alternate history where popular real world conspiracy theories are true.

500|$|Viewing {{the history}} of the world as {{the history of}} warfare between secret societies, {{conspiracy}} theorists go further than Rothkopf, and other scholars who have studied the global power elite, by claiming that established upper-class families with [...] "old money" [...] who founded and finance the <b>Bilderberg</b> <b>Group,</b> Bohemian Club, Club of Rome, Council on Foreign Relations, Rhodes Trust, Skull and Bones, Trilateral Commission, and similar think tanks and private clubs, are illuminated conspirators plotting to impose a totalitarian New World Order—the implementation of an authoritarian world government controlled by the United Nations and a global central bank, which maintains political power through the financialization of the economy, regulation and restriction of speech through the concentration of media ownership, mass surveillance, widespread use of state terrorism, and an all-encompassing propaganda that creates a cult of personality around a puppet world leader and ideologizes world government as the culmination of history's progress.|$|E

2500|$|Danzig {{is an avid}} {{reader and}} owns a large book {{collection}} on subjects including the occult, religious history and true murder cases. Danzig also has a long-standing interest in New World Order related conspiracies: [...] "Not only have I {{always been interested in}} the families that run the world forever, that people know now as the <b>Bilderberg</b> <b>Group.</b> But there’s an older book called The Committee of 300 which tells you all about it. I mean, I got in trouble for this back in the 90s, talking about this kind of stuff -- how the United States is based on a Freemason thing, and I got so many government files on me from that one".|$|E
2500|$|The group's {{original}} goal {{of promoting}} Atlanticism, of strengthening U.S.–European relations and preventing another world war has grown; the Bilderberg Group's theme is to [...] "bolster a consensus around free market Western capitalism and its interests around the globe" [...] according to Andrew Kakabadse. In 2001, Denis Healey, a <b>Bilderberg</b> <b>group</b> founder and a steering committee member for 30 years, said, [...] "To {{say we were}} striving for a one-world government is exaggerated, but not wholly unfair. Those of us in Bilderberg felt we couldn't go on forever fighting one another for nothing and killing people and rendering millions homeless. So we felt that a single community throughout {{the world would be}} a good thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2010, former Cuban {{president}} Fidel Castro wrote {{a controversial}} {{article for the}} Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma in which he cited Daniel Estulin's 2006 book The Secrets of the Bilderberg Club, which, as quoted by Castro, describes [...] "sinister cliques and the Bilderberg lobbyists" [...] manipulating the public [...] "to install a world government that knows no borders and is not accountable to anyone but its own self."

2500|$|According to the {{web page}} of the group, the {{meetings}} are conducted under the Chatham House Rule, allowing the participants to use any information they gained during the meeting, but not to disclose {{the names of the}} speakers or any other participants. According to former chairman Étienne Davignon in 2011, a major attraction of <b>Bilderberg</b> <b>group</b> meetings is that they provide an opportunity for participants to speak and debate candidly and to find out what major figures really think, without the risk of off-the-cuff comments becoming fodder for controversy in the media. A 2008 press release from the [...] "American Friends of Bilderberg" [...] stated that [...] "Bilderberg's only activity is its annual Conference and that at the meetings, no resolutions were proposed, no votes taken, and no policy statements issued." [...] However, in November 2009, the group hosted a dinner meeting at the Château of Val-Duchesse in Brussels outside its annual conference to promote the candidacy of Herman Van Rompuy for President of the European Council.|$|E
