5|$|Several {{times between}} 1978–89, the two wild-card games had to <b>be</b> <b>played</b> <b>on</b> {{different}} days. Normally they both {{would be held}} on Sunday. In 1983 and 1988, the games were split between Saturday and Monday because Sunday was Christmas, and the NFL had avoided playing on that day at the time. In 1984, both games were played in the Pacific Time Zone, {{so they had to}} <b>be</b> <b>played</b> <b>on</b> Saturday and Sunday to accommodate for time differences. In 1985, both the New York Giants and Jets hosted wild-card games. As they have shared a home stadium since 1984, the games had to <b>be</b> <b>played</b> <b>on</b> different days.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1998 season, CONMEBOL {{discontinued}} the Supercopa Sudamericana. As {{a result}} of not having an important, secondary tournament, the Recopa Sudamericana went into a hiatus from 1999 until 2002. However, the introduction of the new Copa Sudamericana revitalized the competition with Olimpia winning the 2003 final in Los Angeles. Played on a neutral venue {{for the second year in}} a row, Cienciano defeated Boca Juniors on penalties to win their second international title. From 2005 onwards, the Recopa Sudamericana would <b>be</b> <b>played</b> <b>on</b> a home-and-away basis.|$|E
5|$|Casual games can {{be played}} with only minimal equipment– a basic game can <b>be</b> <b>played</b> <b>on</b> almost any open area of {{reasonable}} size with just a ball and items to mark the positions of two sets of goalposts. Such games can have team sizes that vary from eleven-a-side, can use a limited or modified subset of the official rules, and can be self-officiated by the players.|$|E
5|$|Each console has {{a variety}} of games. Most games {{released}} on the original PlayStation are backwards compatible and can be played directly on its successors, the PlayStation 2, PSX and PlayStation 3. Some of these games can also <b>be</b> <b>played</b> <b>on</b> the PlayStation Portable but they must be purchased and downloaded from a list of PS one Classics from the PlayStation Store. Games released on the PlayStation 2 can currently only <b>be</b> <b>played</b> <b>on</b> the original console as well as the PSX and the early models of the PlayStation 3 which are backwards compatible. The PlayStation 3 has two types of games, those released on Blu-ray Discs and downloadable games from the PlayStation Store. The PlayStation Portable consists of numerous games available on both its physical media, the Universal Media Disc and the Digital Download from the PlayStation Store. However, some games are only available on the UMD while others are only available on the PlayStation Store. The PlayStation Vita consists of games available on both its physical media, the PlayStation Vita card and digital download from the PlayStation Store.|$|E

5|$|In October 2013, NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{announced plans}} to revisit the idea to expand the playoffs to 14 teams, with the increased revenue gained from the two additional postseason games being used to offset plans to shorten the preseason. The two extra Wild Card games could also be scheduled on the weekend, creating triple-headers on both Saturday and Sunday. Goodell then suggested that they might instead <b>be</b> <b>played</b> <b>on</b> Friday and/or Monday, which may eventually cause scheduling conflicts with games of the new College Football Playoff.|$|E
5|$|Jordal Amfi, {{an outdoor}} {{artificial}} ice rink, was built with {{a capacity for}} 10,000 spectators.

Of the tournament's 36 matches, 23 were played at Jordal, while the remaining were played at Kadettangen in Bærum, Dælenenga idrettspark in Oslo, Lillestrøm stadion in Skedsmo and Marienlyst stadion in Drammen.|$|E

5|$|Only two {{or three}} frets are needed for the guitarchords—major, minor, and {{dominant}} sevenths—which are emphasized in introductions to guitar-playing and to the fundamentals of music. Each major and minor chord can <b>be</b> <b>played</b> <b>on</b> two successive frets on three successive strings, and therefore each needs only two fingers. Other chords—seconds, fourths, sevenths, and ninths—are played on only three successive frets. For fundamental-chord fingerings, major-thirds tuning's simplicity and consistency are not shared by standard tuning, whose seventh-chord fingering is discussed {{at the end of}} this section.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{scheduled}} to <b>be</b> <b>played</b> <b>on</b> November 20, in July 2010 this game {{was moved to}} Thursday, November 18 to give the Crimson Tide extra {{time to prepare for}} its game against Auburn. In the first ever meeting against the Georgia State Panthers, the Crimson Tide was victorious 63–7. Alabama scored first on an eight-yard Greg McElroy pass to Julio Jones. After a Mark Barron interception ended the first Georgia State drive, Alabama responded with a 71-yard drive capped by a one-yard Mark Ingram touchdown run to take a 14–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Poohsticks is a sport first {{mentioned}} in The House at Pooh Corner, a Winnie-the-Pooh book by A. A. Milne. It {{is a simple}} sport which may <b>be</b> <b>played</b> <b>on</b> any bridge over running water; each player drops a stick on the upstream side of a bridge and the one whose stick first appears on the downstream side is the winner. The annual World Poohsticks Championships have been held at Day's Lock on the River Thames in the UK since 1984.|$|E

5|$|The game {{took the}} form of a ROM hack of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System version of Chrono Trigger. It was coded using Chrono Trigger ROM editing software, and was meant to <b>be</b> <b>played</b> <b>on</b> a Super Nintendo Entertainment System emulator. The {{finished}} game was intended to be released as a patch file in the IPS (International Patching System) format, so as to avoid illegal distribution of a full Chrono Trigger ROM.|$|E
5|$|The video had {{its world}} premiere on MTV during prime time on March 31, 1983 though {{it should be}} noted that neither Beat It nor Billie Jean was, as is often claimed, the first music video by an African-American artist to <b>be</b> <b>played</b> <b>on</b> MTV. Soon after its premiere the video was also running on other video {{programs}} including BET's Video Soul, SuperStation WTBS's Night Tracks, and NBC's Friday Night Videos. In fact, Beat It was the first video shown on the latter's first ever telecast on July 29, 1983.|$|E
5|$|Before the Baroque era, {{keyboard}} music generally was {{not written}} for one instrument or another, but rather was written to <b>be</b> <b>played</b> <b>on</b> any keyboard instrument. For this reason, {{much of the}} organ's repertoire through the Renaissance period {{is the same as}} that of the harpsichord. Pre-Renaissance keyboard music is found in compiled manuscripts that may include compositions from a variety of regions. The oldest of these sources is the Robertsbridge Codex, dating from about 1360. The Buxheimer Orgelbuch, which dates from about 1470 and was compiled in Germany, includes intabulations of vocal music by the English composer John Dunstaple. The earliest Italian organ music is found in the Faenza Codex, dating from 1420.|$|E
