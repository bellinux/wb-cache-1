6000|$|... "I {{have had}} faith in God {{all the days}} of my life. I <b>believe</b> <b>He</b> loves justice. I <b>believe</b> <b>He</b> is looking down upon us now, {{choosing}} between us. I <b>believe</b> <b>He</b> waits to work His will through my own right arm. And such is my belief, that we will take equal chance and let Him speak His own judgment." ...|$|R

However, he missed much of the 1935–36 season due to an arthritic condition. <b>Believing</b> <b>he</b> would not recover, the Rangers sold Cook to the Boston Bruins.

5|$|Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is {{contacted}} {{for help}} in finding Zero, and travels to a briefing on the situation. It is explained that Zero is carrying a disease ordinarily confined to the Congo. Meanwhile, Zero and Knox are attempting to have a local newspaper run Zero's story, <b>believing</b> <b>he</b> has been infected in a racially motivated conspiracy akin to the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. Police locate and apprehend Zero, who manages to smear blood on Black's shirt.|$|E
5000|$|... 24) In the book, Jack asks Addie if she <b>believes</b> <b>he's</b> innocent; {{she says}} she doesn't know, but she wants to believe him. In the movie, she does <b>believe</b> <b>he's</b> innocent.|$|R

5|$|Ripley {{discovers that}} Burke sent the colonists to {{investigate}} the derelict spaceship where the Nostromo crew first encountered the eggs, <b>believing</b> <b>he</b> could become wealthy by recovering alien specimens for use as biological weapons. She threatens to expose him, but Bishop informs the group of a greater danger: The power plant was damaged by the dropship crash and will soon explode {{with the force of}} a 40-megaton thermonuclear weapon. He volunteers to crawl through several hundred meters of piping conduits to reach the colony's transmitter and remotely pilot the Sulacos remaining dropship to the surface.|$|E
5|$|After {{years in}} opposition, in 1849, Paraná was {{appointed}} by the national government as president of Pernambuco Province to investigate a Liberal rebellion {{that had taken place}} a year earlier, and seek a fair trial for the rebels. Blamed by his party colleagues for the years in opposition and having lost much of his influence within his own party, Paraná accepted the post, <b>believing</b> <b>he</b> could regain his place among his peers. With the nation internally pacified, he was sent to Uruguay in 1851 to forge an alliance with that country, and with the rebel Argentine provinces of Corrientes and Entre Ríos, against the Argentine Confederation. The alliance triumphed, and the Emperor elevated Paraná to the ranks of the titled nobility.|$|E
5|$|Alien Soldier was {{released}} in 1995 on a physical cartridge format in Australia, Europe and Japan. In North America, the game was delivered exclusively through the Sega Channel cable service. Released late in the Mega Drive's lifecycle and {{after the release of}} the Sega Saturn, Alien Soldier pushed the system to its technical limits. Suganami wished he continued working on it after release, <b>believing</b> <b>he</b> could have improved on the story and graphics. Years later, Yosuke Okunari of Treasure addressed concerns that Alien Soldier {{was released}} as an incomplete game, stating that the notion is only derived from Suganami having originally had large ambitions that were never realized.|$|E

50|$|In this manner, al-Khasibi {{received}} transmission {{from both}} al-Jannān and ʿAlī ibn Aḥmad, thus continuing {{transmission of the}} Nusayri doctrine.

5|$|Before {{heading out}} to a {{baseball}} game at a nearby ballpark, sports fan Mr. Brown drinks several highball cocktails. He arrives at the ballpark to watch the game, but has become so inebriated that the game appears to him in reverse, with the players running the bases backwards and the baseball flying back into the pitcher's hand. After the game is over, Mr. Brown is escorted home {{by one of his}} friends. When they arrive at Brown's house, they encounter his wife who becomes furious with the friend and proceeds to physically assault him, <b>believing</b> <b>he</b> is responsible for her husband's severe intoxication.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1860, Bryan grew up {{in rural}} Illinois and in 1887 moved to Nebraska, where he practiced law and entered politics. He won {{election}} to the House of Representatives in 1890, and was re-elected in 1892, before mounting an unsuccessful US Senate run. He {{set his sights on}} higher office, <b>believing</b> <b>he</b> could be elected president in 1896 even though he remained a relatively minor figure in the Democratic Party. In anticipation of a presidential campaign, he spent much of 1895 and early 1896 making speeches across the United States; his compelling oratory increased his popularity in his party.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge's {{first act}} as {{secretary}} {{was to meet}} with assistant secretary John Archibald Campbell, who had opposed Breckinridge's nomination, <b>believing</b> <b>he</b> would focus on a select few of the department's bureaus and ignore the rest. During their conference, Campbell expressed his desire to retain his post, and Breckinridge agreed, delegating many of the day-to-day details of the department's operation to him. Breckinridge recommended that Davis appoint Isaac M. St. John, head of the Confederate Nitre and Mining Bureau, as permanent commissary general. Davis made the appointment on February 15, and the flow of supplies to Confederate armies improved under St. John. With Confederate ranks plagued by desertion, Breckinridge instituted a draft; when this proved ineffective, he negotiated the resumption of prisoner exchanges with the Union in order to replenish the Confederates' depleted manpower.|$|E

50|$|There are {{conflicting}} versions as to García's birthplace.

Others still <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> was born in Lares.|$|R
60|$|To be {{perfectly}} frank with the reader, I do not <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> ever {{went back to}} the Experimental Farm. I <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> hovered through long hesitations about the fields of the Hickleybrow glebe, and finally, when that squealing began, took the line of least resistance out of his perplexities into the Incognito.|$|R
5|$|Chamberlain {{served only}} {{five months in}} the office before the Conservatives were {{defeated}} in the 1923 general election. Ramsay MacDonald became the first Labour Prime Minister, but the Labour government fell within months, necessitating another general election. By a margin of only 77 votes, Chamberlain narrowly defeated Labour candidate Oswald Mosley (who later led the British Union of Fascists). <b>Believing</b> <b>he</b> would lose if he stood again in Ladywood, Chamberlain arranged to be adopted for Birmingham Edgbaston, the district of the city {{where he was born}} and which was a much safer seat which he would hold {{for the rest of his}} life. The Unionists won the election, but Chamberlain declined to serve again as Chancellor, preferring his former position as Minister of Health.|$|E
5|$|Dallas {{joined the}} Port Curtis Militia in 1913, and was {{commissioned}} as a lieutenant {{prior to the}} outbreak of World WarI. <b>Believing</b> <b>he</b> had little chance of gaining {{a place in the}} recently established Australian Flying Corps, he applied to join the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC), but was rejected. Undaunted, he travelled from Queensland to Melbourne, where he impressed Minister Without Portfolio J.A.Jensen. Jensen gave the young aspirant a letter of introduction to the Australian High Commissioner in London, Sir George Reid. Dallas paid his own passage to England and, once there, applied once more to the RFC. Rejected again, he turned to the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and was accepted, topping the entrance examination over 83 other students. He was commissioned a flight sub-lieutenant and began training at Hendon in June 1915, gaining Pilot's License #1512 on 5August.|$|E

He had vainly protested against releasing the brigade, <b>believing</b> <b>he</b> needed it and all the troops then in Korea {{if he were to}} stop the North Korean offensive against the Pusan Perimeter. At 00:15, September 6, the marines began leaving their lines at Obong-ni Ridge and headed for Pusan. They would join the 1st Marine Regiment and 7th Marine Regiment in forming the new 1st Marine Division.|$|E

I <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> has done this, not because he loves you the best, but because he thinks it {{ought to go to}} the male heir. I quite agree with him that these things should not be governed by affection. He is so good that he will {{certainly}} do what <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> to be his duty." ...|$|R

5|$|Johnson {{returned}} home when his state {{took up the}} issue of secession. His successor as governor, Isham G. Harris, and the legislature, organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession; when that failed, they put the question of leaving the Union to a popular vote. Despite threats on Johnson's life, and actual assaults, he campaigned against both questions, sometimes speaking with a gun on the lectern before him. Although Johnson's eastern region of Tennessee was largely against secession, the second referendum passed, and in June 1861, Tennessee joined the Confederacy. <b>Believing</b> <b>he</b> would be killed if he stayed, Johnson fled through the Cumberland Gap, where his party was in fact shot at. He left his wife and family in Greeneville.|$|E
50|$|Despite his prodigious arcane talents, Camber {{repeatedly}} expresses {{his frustration}} {{that he was}} not born a Healer.

Camber firmly <b>believes</b> <b>he</b> is unworthy of such status.|$|R
