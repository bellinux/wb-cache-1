5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that since Article 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution is pitched at a high level of generality, there is no limitation in the ordinary natural meaning of the phrase. Thus, there is no requirement in the Constitution for personal liberty to <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> narrowly to mean only freedom from physical restraint.|$|E
5|$|Article I {{contains}} the entire original Virginia Declaration of Rights from the 1776 Constitution. Several of the sections have been expanded to incorporate concepts from the United States Bill of Rights, {{including the right}} to due process, the prohibition against double jeopardy, and the right to bear arms. Like the Federal Constitution, the Virginia Bill of Rights, in §17, states that the listing of certain rights is not to <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> to exclude other rights held by the people.|$|E
50|$|At {{a simple}} auction, {{not subject to}} conditions, the bidder <b>is</b> <b>construed</b> as making the offer. At an auction with reserve, the {{potential}} purchaser <b>is</b> <b>construed</b> as making the offer; at an auction without reserve, the auctioneer <b>is</b> <b>construed</b> as making the offer. An auction subject to conditions <b>is</b> <b>construed</b> as two potential contracts: The first binds {{the parties to the}} auction conditions, while the second constitutes the substantive contract of sale.|$|R

30|$|In example  3.1 a, {{modality}} <b>is</b> <b>construed</b> not {{as part of}} evaluated clause {{they want}} amnesty here, but as a relational clause. In other words, modality <b>is</b> <b>construed</b> as a figure including a participant My opinion and a relational process is. By the same token, in example  3.1 b, modality <b>is</b> <b>construed</b> as a figure entailing a participant What I believe, in which a mental clause is rankshifted to serve {{as if it were}} a nominal group, and a relational process is.|$|R
5|$|In this clause the adverbial, helehgüjgeer 'without saying ' must {{precede the}} predicate's complement, üünijg 'it-' {{in order to}} avoid {{syntactic}} ambiguity, since helehgüjgeer is itself derived from a verb and hence an üünijg preceding it could <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> as its complement. If the adverbial was an adjective such as hurdan 'fast', it could optionally immediately precede the predicate. There are also cases in which the adverb must immediately precede the predicate.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{held that}} {{unless and until}} the suspect {{actually}} stated that he was relying on that right, his subsequent voluntary statements {{could be used in}} court and police could continue to interact with (or question) him. The mere act of remaining silent was, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked his or her rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence could <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> as implying a waiver.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament Act 1911 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It is constitutionally {{important}} and partly governs {{the relationship between}} the House of Commons and the House of Lords which make up the two Houses of Parliament. This Act and the Parliament Act 1949 are technically to <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> as complementary in their effects. The two Acts may be cited together as the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949.|$|E

30|$|The {{relationship}} between context and lexicogrammatical systems {{is still being}} developed within SFL. For the position taken in this paper, the relationship of instantiation may provide one way to develop an account of lexical representation within the framework. The concept of construal is also significant. Halliday (1991 : 282) explains that “the culture <b>is</b> <b>construed</b> by systems of language choice; the situation <b>is</b> <b>construed</b> by patterns of language use”. Based on Fig.  2, this statement can be rephrased in more abstract general terms as follows: the meaning potential <b>is</b> <b>construed</b> by systems of language choice; the instance <b>is</b> <b>construed</b> by patterns of language use. This is a point we {{will come back to}} in the next section when considering meaning potential and instance in terms of lexical representation.|$|R
5|$|Three {{days later}} Edwards likely killed Günter Steinhausen, {{a friend of}} Marseille. The next day, 7 September 1942, another close friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt was posted missing in action. These {{personal}} losses weighed heavily on Marseille's mind along with his family tragedy. It was noted he barely spoke and became more morose in the last weeks of his life. The strain of combat also induced consistent sleepwalking at night and other symptoms that could <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> as posttraumatic stress disorder. Marseille never remembered these events.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{nomenclature}} of Diet (Assembly or Parliament), {{this institution}} should {{in no way}} <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> as a broadly, or popularly, elected group of representatives. Many of the states did not have constitutions, and those that did, such as the Duchy of Baden, based suffrage on strict property requirements which effectively limited suffrage to {{a small portion of}} the male population. Furthermore, this impractical solution did not reflect the new status of Prussia in the overall scheme. Although the Prussian army had been dramatically defeated in the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, it had made a spectacular comeback at Waterloo. Consequently, Prussian leaders expected to play a pivotal role in German politics.|$|E
5|$|Historian Nancy Rabinowitz {{argues that}} ancient Greek red vase images portraying women {{with their arms}} around another woman's waist, or leaning on a woman's {{shoulders}} can <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> as expressions of romantic desire. Much of {{the daily lives of}} women in ancient Greece is unknown, specifically their expressions of sexuality. Although men participated in pederastic relationships outside marriage, there is no clear evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same-sex relationships before or during marriage as long as their marital obligations were met. Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection, and in instances where women appear only with other women, their images are eroticized: bathing, touching one another, with dildos placed in and around such scenes, and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of heterosexual marriage or pederastic seduction. Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown.|$|E

5|$|In North America, Smilodon hunted large herbivores such as bison and camels, and it {{remained}} successful even when encountering new prey species in South America. Smilodon {{is thought to}} have killed its prey by holding it still with its forelimbs and biting it, but it is unclear in what manner the bite itself was delivered. Scientists debate whether Smilodon had a social or a solitary lifestyle; analysis of modern predator behavior as well as of Smilodons fossil remains could <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> to lend support to either view. Smilodon probably lived in closed habitats such as forests and bush, which would have provided cover for ambushing prey. Smilodon died out {{at the same time that}} most North and South American megafauna disappeared, about 10,000 years ago. Its reliance on large animals has been proposed as the cause of its extinction, along with climate change and competition with other species, but the exact cause is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Points {{and lines}} {{may be viewed}} as special cases of circles; a point can be {{considered}} as a circle of infinitely small radius, and a line may be thought of an infinitely large circle whose center is also at infinity. From this perspective, the general Apollonius problem is that of constructing circles tangent to three given circles. The nine other cases involving points and lines {{may be viewed as}} limiting cases of the general problem. These limiting cases often have fewer solutions than the general problem; for example, the replacement of a given circle by a given point halves the number of solutions, since a point can <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> as an infinitesimal circle that is either internally or externally tangent.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Stalin in March 1953, the new {{collective}} Soviet leadership started to advocate a New Course. Moscow favored replacing East Germany's Stalinist party leader Walter Ulbricht and made inquiries about Rau as a potential candidate. In response, the leading SED party ideologist, Rudolf Herrnstadt, a candidate member of the Poliburo, with assistance from Rau drew up a concept for just such a New Course in East Germany. However, the workers' uprising, which was suppressed by the Soviet army on 17June led to a backlash. Three weeks later, during a session of the then eight person Politburo (plus six candidate members) on 8July 1953, Rau made a recommendation that Ulbricht be replaced, while Rau's Spanish Civil War comrade, Stasi chief Wilhelm Zaisser, who in Spain had been known as 'General Gómez', accused Ulbricht of having perverted the party. The majority was against Ulbricht. His only supporters were Hermann Matern and Erich Honecker. At that moment however there was no viable candidate who could replace Ulbricht immediately. Suggested were first Rudolf Herrnstadt and then Heinrich Rau, but both were hesitant, thus a decision was postponed. The very next day after the meeting Ulbricht went by plane to Moscow and the Soviet leadership, who in part also feared that deposing Ulbricht might <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> {{as a sign of}} weakness, now secured Ulbricht's position. Subsequently, five members and candidate members of the Politburo lost their positions.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Attorney General Jack Conway {{was asked}} to issue advisory opinions on two gambling-related issues. Republican state senator Damon Thayer asked for an opinion as to whether Instant Racing – allowing individuals to bet {{on the outcome of}} previously run horse races – would be allowable under the state constitution. Democratic Representative Jody Richards also asked for an advisory opinion as to whether a constitutional amendment was required to allow video lottery terminals at the state's racetracks or whether they could <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> as legal under the amendment that allowed a state lottery. Critics charged that Conway had a conflict of interest in the matter because his father {{was a member of the}} Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, but Conway denied that a conflict existed, and the state Executive Branch Ethics Board refused to take a position unless an official request for an investigation were made. Conway subsequently opined in June 2009 that video lottery terminals would be legal if governed by the Kentucky Lottery Corporation and in January 2010 that instant racing would be allowable under the state's parimutuel betting statutes with a few regulatory changes.|$|E
5|$|In {{his paper}} The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories, philosopher Michael Stocker {{challenges}} Kantian ethics (and all modern ethical theories) {{by arguing that}} actions from duty lack certain moral value. He gives the example of Smith, who visits his friend in hospital out of duty, rather than because of the friendship; he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by the wrong thing. Marcia Baron has attempted to defend Kantian ethics on this point. After presenting {{a number of reasons}} that we might find acting out of duty objectionable, she argues that these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their duty is. Acting out of duty is not intrinsically wrong, but immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty-bound to do. Duty need not be seen as cold and impersonal: one may have a duty to cultivate their character or improve their personal relationships. Baron further argues that duty should <b>be</b> <b>construed</b> as a secondary motive—that is, a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done, rather than prompt specific actions. She argues that, seen this way, duty neither reveals a deficiency in one's natural inclinations to act, nor undermines the motives and feelings that are essential to friendship. For Baron, being governed by duty does not mean that duty is always the primary motivation to act; rather, it entails that considerations of duty are always action-guiding. A responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions, such as questions of character. These should guide moral agents to act from duty.|$|E

40|$|Construal Level Theory {{states that}} psychologically {{proximal}} outcomes <b>are</b> <b>construed</b> concretely while psychologically distal outcomes <b>are</b> <b>construed</b> abstractly. Previous {{research suggests that}} the principles of Construal Level Theory can be applied to enhance self-control, as measured by delay discounting. The present studies replicate and expand on this work by examining whether theory-informed priming manipulations lead to delay discounting reductions in a repeated-measures design. Study 1 conceptually replicated previous work, with reduced delay discounting observed as a function of thinking abstractly. Studies 2 and 3 expanded on this work by reinterpreting (a) preference for immediate outcomes as preference for outcomes that <b>are</b> <b>construed</b> concretely, and (b) dispreference for delayed outcomes as dispreference for outcomes that <b>are</b> <b>construed</b> abstractly. Study 2 provided support for the first interpretation, as reduced delay discounting was observed as a function of thinking concretely about the future. Study 3 provided support for the second interpretation, as reduced delay discounting was observed as a function of thinking abstractly about the present. In studies 1 and 3, significant condition × order interactions were observed. In all three studies, the same impact of order of exposure to priming manipulation was observed, indicating specific carryover effects...|$|R
