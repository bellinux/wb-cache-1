30|$|Protection schemes are {{provided}} for distribution systems for quick disconnection of faulty section from the remaining healthy portion of power system. Main aim of protection schemes is {{to restrict the}} fault spread. Normally distribution lines and feeders are protected by over current relays [5]. Over current relays are used as primary {{as well as in}} backup <b>protection</b> <b>relays</b> for the distribution networks. However, their slow operating speed is not a desirable feature for their application as primary protection schemes for sub transmission systems. For sub transmission systems, distance relays are ideal choice for primary protection and over current relay are used in <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>protection</b> <b>relays.</b>|$|R
30|$|The WARP {{based on}} FEI doesn’t require the {{information}} changes {{in time of}} entire power system. Even for the remote <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>protection,</b> it only needs the relevant fault information of the nearby equipment {{which is in the}} rim of adjacent substation groups (the scope may be expanded appropriately from the perspective of information fault tolerance). Therefore, this is a limited wide area protection and it is beneficial to the achievement of its engineering.|$|R
30|$|The WARP {{based on}} FEI can be {{described}} as following: By using the wide area multi-point measurement information in the power system and taking several fault discriminate mechanism, the position of fault element and the state of fault clearing can be determined. And then, the cutting point of WARP can be determined. The breakers at the cutting point operate to isolate the fault through bay layer’s equipment. Its superiority {{is that there is no}} need for setting calculation, the selectivity of backup protection can be guaranteed only by simple coordination of time and logic and the operation time of <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>protection</b> can be shorted effectively. For example, no matter where the remote backup protection locates, because it only coordinates with near backup protection (or main protection), the coordination between protection is simplified. Meanwhile, the backup protection can be prevented from cascading tripping during large scale load transferring.|$|R
40|$|Protective system plays {{a pivotal}} role in any power system operation. In a typical power system there are large numbers of circuit {{breakers}} and relays installed which constitute {{an integral part of the}} protective scheme. Relay is a device that senses and locates the fault and sends a command to the circuit breaker to disconnect the faulty element. Relay coordination is done to provide primary as well as <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>protection</b> from any fault that is likely to occur in the system. In this paper, overcurrent relay coordination is implemented on a 72 bus 220 KV substation. Load flow studies and the short circuit analysis on the test system is initially done followed by relay coordination. Fault current data obtained from short circuit studies enables us to obtain operating time of the relays used in the test system. The simulated value of operating time provides the coordinated operation of all the relays connected from 220 kV to 33 kV line thereby protecting the equipment of the test system. Keywords...|$|R
30|$|As {{electric}} power system encompasses comprehensive interacting elements, {{there is a chance}} of occurring faults or unwanted short circuit conditions for all time. The flow of heavy currents due to short circuits causes damage to the equipments and other elements of power system [1]. Precise differentiation of faults and exact indication of fault type are the two key aspects for protecting the transmission line from various disturbances, faults and their consequences. Distance relay is one of the universal short circuit protection schemes in a transmission line which performs both primary and backup protection. Primary protection is as quick as possible with no time delay whereas <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>protection</b> is operational merely if primary relay fails. Various protecting zones are provided through distance relay based on the percentages of line impedances. The conventional distance relaying scheme usually provide protection to only 80 % of the line in Zone 1, Zone 2 covers 120 % of line and Zone 3 is set to cover the longest remote line. It is set up to operate with a twice time delay of Zone 1. Performance degradation occurs due to several circumstances like fault-path resistance, remote in-feed currents, and shunt capacitance [2, 3].|$|R

30|$|In [18], {{support vector machine}} (SVM) {{has been}} used for fault {{detection}} but it has the demerits of large training data and more memory requirements. The limitations of method suggested in [19] are that it requires large training data and AC section faults are not realized. Several artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are used for AC lines [20, 21] but detection of fault in DC lines from onshore wind has not been discussed. Four-terminal HVDC system during wind speed and power variations with onshore grid faults has been discussed in [22]. It focused on fault ride through capability and not on section identification. Wavelet techniques suggested in [23] for wind farm protection requires high sampling frequency which is practically difficult to analyze. It also depends on information from both ends of line. It uses detail coefficients which has the disadvantage of small standard deviation [23]. In [24, 25, 26], detailed modeling of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) has been studied. Its properties are compared with asynchronous and synchronous machines. In [27], a protection system for multi-terminal system based on the supplemental inductor placed {{at both ends of the}} DC line has been proposed. Drawback of the scheme is that main protection may not identify the high-resistance faults. Hence <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>protection</b> is required which needs data from both ends.|$|R
40|$|The {{investment}} in wind farms is increasing rapidly {{and in many}} aspects the industry is maturing. Instead of connecting single wind turbine or small wind farms to the distribution network, the energy companies and manufactures are connecting large wind farms to the transmission network. These farms can contain 200 plus turbines and have a rated capacity of greater than 500 MW up to several GW. Providing proper protection for these farms is a major challenge. In the UK, any wind farm rated above 100 MW is required to obey the grid code which means the protection consideration will be directed for grid connection and will be different from wind farms which {{are connected to the}} distribution network. In addition to the considerations of a grid connected generator, the particular characteristics of the types of turbine involved add further complications. This paper reviews the existing technologies used for protecting large wind farms and how they will affect the protection of the local transmission feeders and busbars. It is a challenge for the wind farm's protection to achieve 120 ms fault clearance for the transmission network and 800 ms fir a <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>protection.</b> Since wind turbines have different characteristics to those of conventional power plant, the paper discusses the special features and settings for the protection schemes used for large wind farms...|$|R
40|$|A 500 kV {{overhead}} line needs adequate protection for {{power to be}} transmitted safely and efficiently. Current differential protection {{is a type of}} protection that is used on a 500 kV line. In a three phase network, six matched current transformers are used in line differential protection. Three current transformers are placed {{at each end of the}} line with one in each phase. The two current transformers at each end of the line on the same phase are connected in a way to measure the differential current owing in their secondary windings. Distance protection is another form of protection used on a 500 kV line. In a three phase network, three current transformers and three voltage transformers are employed at each end of the protected line. This form of protection looks at the impedance of the line and registers a fault whenever the impedance seen by the relay becomes less that a set value. Both current differential and distance protection can be employed at the same time on the same line. This project looks at a systematic way to determine line current differential relay settings with distance <b>protection</b> as the <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>protection</b> on a 500 kV line. A simulation of faults to determine system behaviour under the fault condition is carried out on both modes of protection.
