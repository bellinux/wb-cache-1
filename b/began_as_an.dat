5|$|Settlement in {{the region}} of Gaza dates back to 3300–3000 BCE at Tell as-Sakan, a site located south of the present-day city, which <b>began</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Ancient Egyptian {{fortress}} built in Canaanite territory. Tell as-Sakan prospered as Canaanite cities began to trade agricultural goods with the Egyptians. However, when Egypt's economic interests shifted to the cedar trade with Lebanon, Gaza's role was reduced to that of a port for ships carrying goods and it declined economically. The site was virtually abandoned and remained so throughout the Early Bronze Age II.|$|E
5|$|Slavery by Another Name <b>began</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> article which Blackmon {{wrote for}} The Wall Street Journal {{detailing}} {{the use of}} black forced labor by U.S. Steel Corporation.

KALW was the Bay Area's first FM radio station, and first radio station to begin commercial broadcasting west of the Mississippi River when it signed on the air in 1941.

5|$|William Etty, {{the son of}} a York {{baker and}} miller, <b>began</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{apprentice}} printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved to London at the age of 18, with the intention of becoming a history painter {{in the tradition of the}} Old Masters.

5|$|After {{the bombings}} at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, {{a number of}} Manhattan Project {{physicists}} founded the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which <b>began</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> emergency action undertaken by scientists who saw urgent need for an immediate educational program about atomic weapons. In {{the face of the}} destructiveness of the new weapons and in anticipation of the nuclear arms race several project members including Bohr, Bush and Conant expressed the view that it was necessary to reach agreement on international control of nuclear research and atomic weapons. The Baruch Plan, unveiled {{in a speech to the}} newly formed United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC) in June 1946, proposed the establishment of an international atomic development authority, but was not adopted.|$|E

5|$|Founded in 1892, the Carabane {{school was}} one of the first in the region. It <b>began</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns {{belonging}} to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls. Soon, there were 60students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona.|$|E
5|$|In {{developing}} the mythology behind the film, the creators used many inspirations. For instance, several character names are near-anagrams: Elly Kedward (The Blair Witch) is Edward Kelley, a 16th-century mystic, and Rustin Parr, the fictional 1940s child-murderer, <b>began</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> anagram for Rasputin. Viewers {{are told that}} the Blair Witch is, according to legend, the ghost of Elly Kedward, a woman banished from the Blair Township (latter-day Burkittsville) for witchcraft in 1785. The directors incorporated {{that part of the}} legend, along with allusions to the Salem witch trials and Arthur Miller's 1953 play The Crucible, to play on the themes of injustice done on those who were called witches.|$|E
5|$|Kono's {{inspiration}} for the first Clock Tower title came from watching Italian film director Dario Argento's horror films, especially his film Phenomena (1985). The game <b>began</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> experimental project with a low budget and small staff. It sold well enough to prompt a direct sequel which competed with Capcom's Resident Evil (1996). The third game in the series was not directed by Kono and was a critical failure. Human Entertainment {{went out of business}} in 2000, after which Sunsoft purchased the Clock Tower intellectual property. They would go on to develop Clock Tower 3 with Capcom which was a commercial failure.|$|E

5|$|The CIA's base at Camp Chapman {{was set up}} at the {{beginning}} of the U.S.-led offensive against al-Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban in 2001. It <b>began</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> improvised center for operations. A military base at {{the beginning}}, it was later transformed into a CIA base. Camp Chapman was also used as a base for the Khost Provincial Reconstruction Team, a military-led development group. In recent years, the base evolved into a major counter-terrorism hub of the CIA's paramilitary Special Activities Division, used for joint operation with U.S. special operations forces and Afghan allies. It also had a housing compound for U.S. intelligence officers.|$|E
5|$|The NWOBHM <b>began</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{underground}} phenomenon {{growing in}} parallel to punk and largely {{ignored by the}} media. It was only through the promotion of rock DJ Neal Kay and Sounds campaigning that it reached the public consciousness and gained radio airplay, recognition and success in the UK. The movement involved mostly young, white, male and working-class musicians and fans, who suffered the hardships brought on by rising unemployment for years after the 1973–75 recession. As a reaction to their bleak reality, they created a community separate from mainstream society to enjoy each other's company and their favourite loud music. The NWOBHM was heavily criticised for the excessive hype generated by local media in favour of mostly talentless musicians. Nonetheless, it generated a renewal in the genre of heavy metal music and furthered {{the progress of the}} heavy metal subculture, whose updated behavioural and visual codes were quickly adopted by metal fans worldwide after the spread of the music to continental Europe, North America and Japan.|$|E
5|$|The Toronto Raptors {{have made}} 34 National Basketball Association (NBA) draft {{selections}} during their draft history. The Raptors <b>began</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> expansion team in 1995 and first {{participated in the}} NBA draft on June 28, 1995 at the SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In 1989, the NBA agreed with the National Basketball Players' Association to limit drafts to two rounds, an arrangement that has remained the same up the present time. Before each draft, an NBA Draft Lottery determines the first round selection order for the teams that missed the playoffs during the prior season. Teams can also trade their picks, which means that in some drafts teams may have {{more or less than}} two draft picks, although they must have at least one first-round pick every other year.|$|E
