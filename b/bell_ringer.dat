25|$|In later, secular times, the <b>bell</b> <b>ringer</b> {{would pass}} {{through the streets of}} villages, towns or cities announcing the name of a {{recently}} deceased person, with details of the funeral. At the funeral the <b>bell</b> <b>ringer,</b> often the beadle, would walk at the head the cortege, solemnly ringing the bell from the home of the deceased until the church was reached.

25|$|As a {{historic}} memento to {{victory over the}} Swedish army in 1645, the local Petrov Cathedral rings noon an hour earlier, at 11o'clock because the locals and Swedish army were in stalemate and the Swedish general said he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon; the <b>bell</b> <b>ringer</b> tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early. Keeping his word, the general and his army left.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1812 earthquake, the two largest bells cracked and split open. Due to this damage neither produced clear tones. Regardless, they were hung in the campanario that went up the following year. During the Mission's heyday, a lone bell also hung at the west end of the front corridor, next to an entrance gate which has long since eroded away. One of O' Sullivan's companions during his tenure at San Juan Capistrano was José de Gracia Cruz, better known as Acú, who related many stories and legends of the Mission. A descendent of the Juaneño Indians, he served as the Mission's <b>bell</b> <b>ringer</b> until his death in 1924.|$|E

500|$|In 1947, {{a novice}} <b>bell</b> <b>ringer</b> {{died in an}} {{accident}} {{when he tried to}} move one of the bells while standing under it. [...] The bell swung back and hit him in the head, killing him instantly. [...] The bell was then [...] "punished" [...] by removing the clapper. In the following years, the bell was known as la castigada ("the punished one"), or la muda ("the mute one"). In 2000, the clapper was reinstalled in the bell.|$|E
500|$|The {{reason for}} the {{difficulties}} with the bell is not certain. The Whitechapel Foundry, still in business today, takes {{the position that the}} bell was either damaged in transit or was broken by an inexperienced <b>bell</b> <b>ringer,</b> who incautiously sent the clapper flying against the rim, rather than the body of the bell. In 1975, the Winterthur Museum conducted an analysis of the metal in the bell, and concluded that [...] "a series of errors made in the construction, reconstruction, and second reconstruction of the Bell resulted in a brittle bell that barely missed being broken up for scrap". The Museum found a considerably higher level of tin in the Liberty Bell than in other Whitechapel bells of that era, and suggested that Whitechapel made an error in the alloy, perhaps by using scraps {{with a high level of}} tin to begin the melt instead of the usual pure copper. The analysis found that, on the second recasting, instead of adding pure tin to the bell metal, Pass and Stow added cheap pewter with a high lead content, and incompletely mixed the new metal into the mold. The result was [...] "an extremely brittle alloy which not only caused the Bell to fail in service but made it easy for early souvenir collectors to knock off substantial trophies from the rim".|$|E

He continued at New South Wales until 1920, however with seasonal returns of 23, 54, 201, 80 and 13 runs and wicket totals that surpassed two per season only {{twice in the}} years either side of World War I, Noble was past his prime. He retired in 1920 and moved into banking, and then dentistry. He wrote and published several works on cricket: Gilligan's Men (1925), The Game's the Thing (1926), Those Ashes (1927), and The Fight for the Ashes (1929) and also became a noted commentator and broadcaster. He continued his association with Paddington Cricket Club, and worked for a time coaching junior cricket teams. He died in Sydney on 22 June 1940, survived by his brother who died a year later. [...] He was also a church <b>bell</b> <b>ringer,</b> and reportedly visited many towers in England while on cricket tours.|$|E
2500|$|A 1915 {{article in}} Overland Monthly {{magazine}} made {{note of the}} birds' annual habit of nesting beneath the Mission's eaves and archways from spring through fall, and made the swallows the [...] "signature icon" [...] of the Mission; O'Sullivan utilized interest in the phenomenon to generate public interest in restoration efforts during his two decades in residence. One of <b>bell</b> <b>ringer</b> Acú's most colorful tales was that the swallows (or las golondrinas, as he called them) flew over the Atlantic Ocean to Jerusalem each winter, carrying small twigs on which they could rest atop the water along the way. On March 13, 1939, a popular radio program was broadcast live from the Mission grounds, announcing the swallows' arrival. Composer Leon René was so inspired by the event that he penned the song [...] "When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano" [...] in tribute. During its initial release the song spent several weeks atop the Your Hit Parade charts. The song has been recorded by such musicians as The Ink Spots, Fred Waring, Guy Lombardo, Glenn Miller, The Five Satins and Pat Boone. A glassed-off room in the Mission has been designated in René's honor and displays the upright piano on which he composed the tune, the reception desk from his office and several copies of the song's sheet music and other pieces of furniture, all donated by René's family.|$|E
