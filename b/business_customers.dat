25|$|To {{reduce the}} time {{required}} for the mail carrier to complete delivery when {{the front door of}} a home was located some distance from the street, it was proposed that individual mail boxes for residential or <b>business</b> <b>customers</b> be mounted curbside on fence-posts, lamp-posts, or other supports. While this idea was rejected for city mail delivery, it was adopted for rural areas. Curbside mailboxes located on a rural route or road and sited at the intersection of the road with each recipient's carriageway or private drive allowed limited numbers of mail carriers to deliver mail to many widely scattered farms and ranches in a single day using horse-drawn wagons or later on, motor vehicles.|$|E

In literature, place marketing strategies vary from the very simple to the very sophisticated. Through examination of present marketing and communication practices of place marketers, we find that these strategies are unplanned or “seat of the pants. ” We also find that the primary reason for the lack of deliberate and targeted strategies is a lack of understanding of customer decision-making processes. We suggest that only by understanding differences in <b>business</b> <b>customer</b> segments of the market can place marketers become more efficient and effective in winning plant placements. Using data from <b>business</b> <b>customer</b> decision-making processes, we attempt to close the knowledge gap...|$|R
25|$|During {{the early}} days, the pointed G logo was used on two other {{subsidiary}} businesses. Firstly came the 'Red Arrow Television Rental' chain. During {{the days when}} many families preferred to rent their TV sets to offset poor reliability and changing fashions, this company fared well alongside the established 'heavy hitters' such as Radio Rentals. The company's opening promotion was to give every new customer a small, Hiawatha-style figurine to stand {{on top of their}} new TV set. Upon its success, the name was later changed to 'Granada TV Rental'. Based on the results of this company, Granada Television dipped its toes into the office furniture rental business, and carpet sales and fitting for larger <b>business</b> <b>customers,</b> with 'Black Arrow'. This business was less successful.|$|E

AT Inc. previously relocated its corporate headquarters to San Antonio from St. Louis, Missouri, in 1992, when it was then named Southwestern Bell Corporation. The company's Telecom Operations group, which serves residential and regional <b>business</b> <b>customers</b> in 22 U.S. states, remains in San Antonio.

St. Louis continues as home to the company's Directory operations, AT Advertising Solutions.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturing, printing, {{publishing}} and food processing also play major {{roles in the}} city's economy. Several medical products and services companies are headquartered in the Chicago area, including Baxter International, Boeing, Abbott Laboratories, and the Healthcare division of General Electric. In addition to Boeing, which located its headquarters in Chicago in 2001, and United Airlines in 2011, GE Transportation moved its offices to the city in 2013 and GE Healthcare moved its HQ to the city in 2016, as did ThyssenKrupp North America, and agriculture giant Archer Daniels Midland. Moreover, {{the construction of the}} Illinois and Michigan Canal, which helped move goods from the Great Lakes south on the Mississippi River, and of the railroads in the 19th century made the city a major transportation center in the United States. In the 1840s, Chicago became a major grain port, and in the 1850s and 1860s Chicago's pork and beef industry expanded. As the major meat companies grew in Chicago many, such as Armour and Company, created global enterprises. Though the meatpacking industry currently plays a lesser role in the city's economy, Chicago continues to be a major transportation and distribution center. Lured by a combination of large <b>business</b> <b>customers,</b> federal research dollars, and a large hiring pool fed by the area's universities, Chicago is also the site {{of a growing number of}} web startup companies like CareerBuilder, Orbitz, 37signals, Groupon, Feedburner, and NowSecure.|$|E
