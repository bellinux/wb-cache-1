Preliminary explayning the methodology, earth buried conductors are studied in their double function of earth electrodes and connection elements between earthing grids, both in absence and in presence of other interfering conductors. Subsequently is analyzed, with a distributed parameters approach, the system constituted by an earth <b>buried</b> <b>conductor</b> and a MV tri-phase cable line. The equations that describe system behaviour are solved with the decoupling method of Modal Analysis. The proposed methodology allows to determinate the currents injected in the ground by the <b>buried</b> <b>conductor</b> and by the earth electrodes of the substations, {{as a consequence of}} an earth fault, whichever is the faulty substation.

30|$|Earthquake swarm {{activity}} in the Kojiri area provides additional insights into the structural significance of this <b>buried</b> <b>conductor</b> and its immediate surrounds. Several linear clusters of swarms have been observed in the Kojiri area between 2001 and 2015, surrounding the bowl-shaped conductor (Fig.  4 b, h, and Additional file 1 : Figs. S 2 b and S 2 d), whereas few earthquakes have been recorded in the Gora area. Furthermore, the seismicity beneath the southern extent of Mt. Kintoki, which was possibly remotely triggered by the 2011 great Tohoku earthquake (Additional file 1 : Fig. S 1), was also observed {{along the edge of}} the <b>buried</b> <b>conductor</b> in this area (Additional file 1 : Fig. S 2 c, 5  km north of the origin). Yukutake et al. (2011) suggested that the earthquake swarms observed around the Kojiri area in 2009 were activated by fluid flow along thin plane-like zones. The earthquake swarm beneath the southern extent of Mt. Kintoki also showed clear linear alignments (Yukutake et al. 2010). Since the bowl-shaped conductor beneath the Kojiri area is likely indicative of a buried structure containing saturated fluids, a series of weak zones may have evolved along the outer boundary of this structural resistivity contrast. However, the spacing of the observation sites is insufficient to explore such thin structures. Additional MT measurements at a closer spacing are required to image the subsurface structures surrounding the linear clusters of earthquake swarms beneath Hakone volcano.|$|E

40|$|Field {{experiments}} and computer simulations of two sectionalized horizontal earth electrodes are presented. The electrodes were energized using various voltage sources (dc, and transients of different shapes), and measurements {{of current and}} voltage magnitudes {{along the length of}} the electrode were examined. Furthermore, by incrementally increasing the length of the test electrodes, the effective length of the earth electrodes was determined experimentally. The experimental and simulation results show reasonably close agreement which gives confidence in predicting the effective length. A new method is proposed to increase the effective length of the horizontal earth electrode by installing an additional insulated parallel conductor which is bonded to the horizontal electrode at points along its length. Such insulated conductor allows current to be distributed further away from the injection point without high leakage as would occur with standard horizontal electrodes buried in the ground. The results show that the current and voltage distributions are modified such that a greater length of <b>buried</b> <b>conductor</b> is utilized and that this contributes to an additional reduction in the earth impedance, and hence the earth potential rise at the point of current injection. The effect of the proposed technique is simulated on a practical wind turbine earthing design, and shows significant gains...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{technique has}} been developed to solve the three-dimensional potential distribution about a point source of current located in or {{on the surface of}} a half-space containing an arbitrary three-dimensional conductivity distribution. Self-adjoint difference equations are obtained for Poisson's equation using finite-difference approximations in conjunction with an elemental volume discretization of the lower half-space. Potential distribution at all points in the set defining the subsurface are simultaneously solved for multiple point sources of current. Accurate and stable solutions are obtained using full, banded, Cholesky decomposition of the capacitance matrix as well as the recently developed Incomplete Cholesky-Conjugate Gradient Iterative method. A comparison of the two- and three-dimensional simple block-shaped models, for the collinear dipole-dipole array, indicates substantially lower anomaly indices for inhomogeneities of finite strike-extent. In general, the strike-extents of inhomogeneities have to be approximately 10 times the dipole lengths before the response becomes two-dimensional. The saturation effect with increasing conductivity contrasts appears sooner for the three-dimensional conductive inhomogeneities than for corresponding models with infinite strike lengths. A downhole-to-surface configuration of electrodes produces diagnostic total field apparent resistivity maps for three-dimensional buried inhomogeneities.

40|$|In this {{investigation}} the primary object {{has been to}} study the possible effect of weak electric currents, similar to those existing in nature, upon plant growth and certain phases of the environment. The experiments have been of two types: (1) Those using the earth-air currents collected and discharged by means of elevated metal brushes, and (2) those using currents generated {{as the result of}} differences in potential between buried, aerially connected, copper and zinc electrodes, sometimes augmented by dry cells placed in the circuits. In both types the currents developed have been applied to the root areas of the plants. 1. Currents obtained by means of. the installation of elevated metal brushes connected with buried wires trans versing the root areas of field crops apparently had little effect on yields. Yearly averages show a variation from the controls with corn of - 2. 78 to + 4. 51 percent; with soybeans of + 0. 29 to + 3. 16 percent; with turnips of - 3. 95 to + 7. 03 percent; with chard of + 3. 39 to + 9. 08 percent; with beets of + 5. 55 to + 11. 05 percent; with string beans of + 1. 82 to + 3. 91 percent. 2. Currents passing through the elevated metal brushes during fair weather changed direction frequently and were of the order of from 5. 0 x 10 - 10 amperes to 1. 0 x 10 - 9 amperes. During unsettled weather the currents varied greatly, both in direction and magnitude, the highest value being of the order of 200 x 10 - 9 amperes. 3. The intensities of the currents measured in the soil and along the <b>buried</b> <b>conductor</b> at various distances from one of the elevated 2 ̆ 7 brushes seemed to bear no relation to the intensities measured {{at the point where the}} conductor entered the soil. 4. The application of currents ranging in intensity from 7, 000 to 20, 000 volts to the roots of oats in greenhouse fiats did not produce significant variations in yields of grain and straw. The yields of the treated lots varied both above and below the average of the controls, and none yielded more than the higher control. The high voltage currents were applied for 15 minutes each day throughout the growing period. 5. The greenhouse treatments in which an electrode of copper and one of zinc were buried at opposite ends of the soil area to be treated, and connected aerially by copper wire, produced significant increases in yields of oats the first year of the experiment. Currents measured were of the order of from 0. 5 to 1. 5 milliamperes. The second year of the experiment, the grain and straw yields were not increased by treatment with electric current, while root yields were significantly decreased. For this test one or two dry cells were included in the circuit for each treated lot, and current intensities ranged as high as 4. 0 milliamperes. 6. In the field trials with oats the copper-zinc electrodes combination, with dry cells included in the circuits, provided current intensities ranging from 2. 0 to 55. 0 milliamperes but failed to affect the yields significantly. 7. In the comparisons using the copper-zinc electrodes combination, the percentage of total nitrogen of oats apparently was not affected by treatment with electric current. 8. With the exception of the determinations made in connection with the field tests, a rather definite relationship between electrical treatment and numbers of soil microorganisms was observed throughout the series of experiments. In the 1932 greenhouse experiment, a comparison of 24 samples showed increases for the electrically treated lots of 14 to 123 percent and of 15 to 23 percent for 20 samples in 1933. Further proof was provided by the carbon dioxide determinations, a weak current of 0. 1 milliampere producing appreciable increases in amounts of carbon dioxide formed and a relatively strong current of 10 to 15 milliamperes resulting in pronounced decreases...|$|E

The same kind of induction happens in overhead and above ground conductors which experience the passing energy of an atmospheric EMP caused by the lightning flash. Surge arresters only protect against induced transients characteristic of a lightning discharge's rapid rise-time and will not protect against electrification caused by a direct strike to the conductor. Transients similar to lightning-induced, such as from a high voltage system's fault switching, may also be safely diverted to ground; however, continuous overcurrents are not protected against by these devices.

Apart from the valuable contributions made towards the basic sciences, ion beams have percolated into the applied fields as well.

40|$|Some {{features}} of 1 -D magnetotelluric modelling (1 -D/MT) are reviewed {{from a practical}} point of view. A well-known feature of 1 -D modelling is that deeply <b>buried</b> <b>conductors</b> can always be perfectly fitted with ideally thin sheets of finite conductance. Less well known is that a deeply buried resistor sandwiched by two conductive layers can best be modelled with an insulating layer of minimum thickness. These two observations call to mind Parker’s theory according to which the best fit to a 1 -D structure is a D+ distribution (i. e. a perfectly insulating half-space containing {{a finite number of}} ideally thin sheets, each with a finite conductance). However, a structure with n layers of alternatingly low and high resistivities cannot be fitted satisfactorily by replacing the low-resistivity layers with thin sheets and the high-resistivity ones by insulators, as this would reduce the number of adjustable parameters from an initial 2 n- 1 to only n or n- 1 (the positions of thin sheets with their associated conductances). To achieve its good fit Parker’s D+ distribution also requires a number of adjustable parameters close to 2 n- 1. In other words, it requires about twice as many layers of alternatingly infinite or vanishing resisitivity. But such models d o not, in general, bear any relationship to the structures under investigation. This underlines the case in favour of making use of all possible reliable prior information to constrain the family of permissible models.

The seasonal variation and the nature of&# 13; soil have considerable influence on electrical characteristics and therefore affect the earthling system&# 13; performance. Approach: Eighteen sites were chosen from three main soil divisions. The soil&# 13; resistivity was taken in each of the site at depths of 0. 5, 0. 8 and 1. 2 m using the four point test&# 13; instrument (Wenner Method). From the selected sites in the three soil divisions the temperature was&# 13; also taken at depths of 0. 2, 0. 5, 0. 8 and 1. 0 m. Results: The coefficient of seasonal variation at the&# 13; depth of 0. 5 m was high and reduced drastically at a depth of 1. 2 m. The soil temperature was higher&# 13; than the ambient temperature at the depth of 0. 2 m during the months of December to March. From 0. 8 &# 13; m depth and below the temperature reduced even during the dry seasons. Conclusion: The coefficient&# 13; of seasonal variation of soil at the depth of 0. 8 and 1. 2 m was small (1. 8 - 3. 0) throughout the year in all&# 13; soil types.

40|$|The {{concept of}} Global Earthing System (GES), with {{reference}} to MV distribution systems, was introduced by the CENELEC Harmonization Document HD 637 S 1 (published in 1999) and, later, by the International Standards EN 50522 and IEC EN 61936 - 1 (published in 2010 - 2011). It is defined as: "an equivalent earthing system created by the interconnection of local earthing systems that ensures, by {{the proximity of the}} earthing systems, that there are no dangerous touch voltages". The identification and official classification of GES areas would lead to a simplification of the design and verification procedures of MV/LV substations grounding systems, with associated economical savings for both Distribution System Operators (DSOs) and MV users. However, no practical guidelines are provided by the Standards. Although many works in literature have tried to solve this issue, until now, none of the available methodologies has been massively adopted by the Italian DSOs. In fact, in Italy, just few cases of GES are certified. This happens mostly because the identification methods that are actually available lack in rigorous scientific strength or are money and time consuming. This thesis is based on the work conducted in the Meterglob Project. A pool of 6 partners (Enel Distribuzione S. p. A., Istituto Italiano del Marchio di Qualità IMQ, La Sapienza Università di Roma, Politecnico di Torino, Politecnico di Bari, Università di Palermo) has studied the phenomena linked to GESs. The goal of the project consists in providing a set of guidelines for GES identification. The main aim of this thesis is to contribute in this research field. In this thesis, first, definitions regarding earthing and the conditions to be satisfied for the design of safe MV/LV substation earthing systems (ESs) with regard to touch voltages are shown. Moreover, the maintainability procedures that ensure a safety usage of the electrical installations are introduced. Then, the GES definition is discussed in depth. Some of the main concepts related to GES (e. g., interconnection, proximity and quasi-equipotentiality), which are only cited in the Standards, are instead here fully formalized. The methods available in literature to identify a GES are described and tested in a real urban MV network. Moreover, the main phenomena resulting from the presence of a GES are presented; according to the GES definition, the close interconnection of the grounding systems {{to each other and to}} utility installations (water/gas pipelines, railway tracks, etc.) sets up an overall low resistance grounding system and has mainly two effects: a distribution of the fault current between grounding electrodes (of the faulty substation and of the neighboring ones) and MV cables sheaths; a smoothing of the earth surface potential profile, reducing the hazardous voltage gradients. With reference to the first effect, a dedicated simulation tool is presented. A parametric analysis is carried out in order to evaluate which of the influence factors are the most significant. The setup of field measurements and their results are reported: a real single line to ground fault was produced in a MV network and the currents flowing into the ES and MV cable shields of 5 consecutive substations were measured. Both the field measurements and the model results suggest that the current injected in the faulted MV/LV substation is just a small portion of the fault current. A large part flows back in the feeding cable's shields. According to the simulation results, the main factors that influence the fault current distribution (and therefore the reduction factor, defined as the ratio between the current to earth and the total fault current) are the presence of bare <b>buried</b> <b>conductors,</b> the presence of LV neutral conductors, the per unit length resistance of the cables sheaths and the number of interconnected MV/LV substations.

Multiple <b>buried</b> <b>conductors</b> in a conductive host interact via mutual induction and current &# 64258;ow through the host due to the dissipation of charge accumulated on the conductor boundary.

40|$|Abstract—Currents induced in: 1) a 100 m× 30 m <b>buried</b> rect-angular loop <b>conductor</b> (counterpoise) and 2) a {{grounded}} vertical {{conductor of}} 7 -m height by natural and rocket-triggered light-ning at distances ranging from 60 to 300 m {{were recorded in}} 2005 at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT). The peak values of 12 triggered lightning channel-base currents and the peak values of the induced currents in the coun-terpoise are strongly correlated. The first few microseconds of the current induced in the vertical conductor by triggered lightning return strokes 100 m away resemble electric field time-derivative waveforms simultaneously measured at the ICLRT. During a close natural lightning flash, five pre-first-return-stroke current pulses with peak currents up to 140 A were measured in the vertical con-ductor. These are apparently associated with multiple attempts of an upward-moving unconnected leader occurring {{in response to the}} charge lowered by downward-propagating leader steps.

40|$|In this paper, the {{behaviour}} of {{a horizontal}} electrode under impulse conditions is investigated experimentally at the Cardiff University outdoor earthing test facility. The test electrode consists of 88. 5 m long copper <b>conductor</b> <b>buried</b> {{to a depth}} of 30 cm, and is divided into sections with test pits located along the electrode to enable access for voltage and current measurements along its length. A test circuit is established using an auxiliary current electrode, and a low voltage impulse generator is used to inject current of different magnitudes and shapes into the test electrode. The effect of current injection location, electrode length and current rise time is quantified on the current and earth potential rise (EPR) distribution along the electrode. The measured voltage and current signals were analysed at various points on the electrode to determine the effective length. Good agreement between measured and computed values was obtained. Based on an analysis of the results, the effective length of a horizontal electrode under the particular test conditions was determined and good agreement between measured and computed values was obtained...|$|R
40|$|IEC Standard 61936 - 1 "Power {{installations}} exceeding 1 kV a. c. " {{defines the}} "Global Grounding System" (GGS). It consists essentially in the interconnection of the MV/LV grounding systems, generally {{at least by}} means of the MV cables metal sheaths and/or of dedicated ground <b>conductors</b> <b>buried</b> along the MV cable lines. The interconnection of grounding systems involves a significant reduction of the apparent grounding resistance at the MV/LV substations, by creating a metallic ground-fault current path in parallel with the ground which drains away most of the fault current. Due to the mentioned ground resistance reduction, the IEC 61936 - 1 allows to adopt simplified, relaxed design criteria for the individual grounding systems. The paper suggests recognizing the four "globality" levels of grounding systems in a common zone of influence. It is highlighted the analysis of the interferences between more ground electrodes that can be sensitive for special power systems as data centers and hospitals. It suggests ways to mitigate transferred potentials and a graphical test by a rolling sphere that can be useful to verify the integration of aggregate of ground systems...|$|R
40|$|Controlled source {{electromagnetic}} (CSEM) geophysics {{has been}} used with {{a fair amount of}} success in near surface hydrogeological studies. Recently, these investigations have been conducted frequently in human impacted field sites containing cultural conductors such as metal fences and buried pipes. Cultural noise adds an element of complexity to the geological interpretation of this type of data. This research investigates the influence of mutual induction between two buried targets in a CSEM experiment. In particular, it looks at the mutual coupling between a <b>buried</b> cultural <b>conductor</b> and a geological heterogeneity. We attempt to isolate the Hz field induced by tertiary currents in targets caused by mutual coupling. This is achieved with a Texas A&M 3 D CSEM finite element code, which calculates the secondary Hz fields emanating from a target buried in a halfspace. Buried geological targets and cultural conductors are modeled as volumetric slabs embedded in a halfspace. A series of models have been simulated to study the effect of varying parameters such as target conductivity, transmitter location and shape of a target on the mutual inductance. In each case, the secondary Hz field is calculated for a model with two slabs, and two models with individual slabs. The mutual coupling is calculated by removing the secondary fields from the individual slab models from the response of a two slab model. The calculations of mutual inductance from a variety of such models suggests a complicated interaction of EM fields between the two targets. However, we can explain most of these complexities by adapting a simple approach to Maxwell?s equations. Although the tertiary Hz field is complicated, it may be useful in the characterization and delineation of electrical heterogeneities in the subsurface, which can then be related to geological features such as fractures or joints. It is seen that the most important factor affecting the mutual coupling is the host conductivity. The results have also shown that mutual coupling is very sensitive to transmitter (TX) location, especially when the TX is positioned near one of the targets...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to find an efficient, preferably automated, algorithm or interpretational procedure {{that can be applied}} in real time to localise <b>conductors</b> <b>buried</b> in a host rock, with special attention given to a conductor in a conductive environment. The Time Domain Electromagnetic (TDEM) method is considered and more specifically the central loop configuration which can be found in both ground an airborne acquisition systems. The traditional interpretation approach of decay curve analysis is automated and combined with an adapted S-layer differential transform (Sidorov and Tiskshaev, 1969) to produce conductivity-depth sections with superimposed decay behaviour at every station. The adaptations made to the S-layer differential transform include: a noise filter to improve performance on field data the S-layer differential transform compatibility (SLTC) filter which only allows data conforming to the basic mathematical assumptions made in the transform to be processed (This “compatible” behaviour is derived through a number of synthetic model studies.) a depth correction based on the implications of approximating an infinite number of currents with a single filament. A remaining concern when implementing the S-layer transform is found in two consecutive numerical differentiations and various approaches are analysed to ensure stable differentiation procedures. The automated algorithm is applied to a variety of synthetic models to validate its accuracy and finally examples are shown of its application to both ground and airborne data sets.

40|$|In recent years, {{a lot of}} {{research}} has been carried out into voltage contrast which is now widely used in both failure analysis and the debugging of innovative integrated circuits. The aim {{of this paper is to}} review past developments in this field and its present and future ability to keep pace with the progress in microelectronics. Since secondary electrons are involved in this phenomenon, a brief summary of their properties is drawn up. The two physical effects produced, i. e. the local field effects and the secondary energy shifts, are then examined. They give rise respectively to : i) the qualitative voltage contrast pictures easily seen inside any standard scanning electron microscope, and ii) the quantization of local voltages using the electron beam as an electrical probe where, however, a spectrometer is required. Then, dynamic voltage contrast is examined and the conditions for extending this method to normally working integrated circuits are considered. On the one hand, the resultant testing of <b>conductors</b> <b>buried</b> under insulator offers new and very important capacities. On the other hand, some limitations in the very high frequency domain are discussed. Electron beam testing must not, by definition, change the working conditions of the Integrated Circuit (IC). The physical conditions of the disruption of ICs by electron beam irradiations are presented. The use of the electron beam as an active probe is then discussed. Electron beam testing techniques and their implementation on nowadays ICs are then briefly reviewed. So, both stroboscopic observations and local voltage quantization are available today. Other probing techniques are discussed which can be reckoned on as complementary methods, especially in the case of very high speed circuits such as HEMTs. In conclusion, voltage contrast is now of a mature age, but the extension towards future microelectronics also presupposes an extension in the domain of in situ testing methods and techniques...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the {{evaluation}} of performance and behaviour of earth electrode systems subjected to DC, AC and transient current injections with different rise times and shapes. The performance of the earth electrode system when injected with currents at the power frequency is now well understood, but {{the response of the}} system under high frequency and transient conditions is yet to be fully clarified. This thesis contributes to the better understanding of complex earthing systems such as earth grids and wind turbine earthing system behaviour under high frequency and transient conditions including voltage distributions {{along the length of the}} electrode. The frequency and time domain responses of earth electrodes (vertical and horizontal earth electrodes and earth grids) were quantified for soil resistivity ranged from 10 Ωm to 10 kΩm. Practical wind turbine earthing system models were developed to account for the additional effects of the above–ground tower structure of the wind turbine and also to consider the benefits of various enhancements to the earthing system. Simulations using 1 / 5 μs and 8 / 20 μs impulse currents were carried out, and a number of parameters were quantified; these include the earth potential rise and the voltage distributions at ground surface level. In particular, the contribution of mitigating techniques, such as rings and rods were derived. The computations allowed determination of touch and step voltages. The results show that the performance of an earth electrode depends on a number of factors such as soil resistivity and permittivity and electrode dimensions, and it was found that significant inductive effects dominate at high frequency. Thus, the ability of a horizontal earth electrode to reduce the earth potential rise is limited because, beyond a certain length known as the effective length, no further reduction is obtained. The effective length was determined experimentally by incrementally increasing the length of the test electrode. The experimental and simulation results show reasonably close agreement. Furthermore, reasonable prediction of the effective length may be possible using simple empirically derived equations. The thesis proposes a new method to increase the effective length of in-ground horizontal earth electrodes and the effective area of earth grids. It is proposed that an additional insulated parallel an above ground conductor is bonded to the horizontal electrode at suitable points along its length. Field tests show that the addition to such enhancement reduces inductance effects and helps dissipation of injected currents, so that a greater length of <b>buried</b> earth <b>conductor</b> is utilised, and this contributes to an additional reduction in the earth impedance. Hence, the earth potential rise at the point of current injection is reduced. Enhancing the earthing system in this way results in a significant reduction in the transient potentials developed at the base of the turbine structure. These TEPR reductions produce associated reductions in touch and step voltages. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Minimization of Construction Costs of Substation Grounding Grids: In every {{electrical}} installation, one of {{the most}} important aspects is adequate grounding; in particular, the grounding of high-voltage substations to protect people and equipment in the event of an electrical fault. Well-designed grounding systems ensure the performance of power systems and safety of personnel. It is desirable that the substation grounding provides a near zero resistance to remote earth. The prevailing practice of most utilities is to install a grid of horizontal ground electrodes (<b>buried</b> bare copper <b>conductors)</b> supplemented by a number of vertical ground rods connected to the grid, and by a number of equipment grounding mats and interconnecting cables. The grounding grid provides a common ground for the electrical equipment and for all metallic structures at the station. It also limits the surface potential gradient. Currently the IEEE 80 - 2000 standard for substations grounding limits the determination of the grounding parameters (namely step, touch and ground potential rise) to that of a uniform soil model unless the Sunde graphical method is used. With the Sunde graphical method, it relies on interpretation to obtain a two layer soil model. Without the use of the graphical method, the IEEE 81 - 1983 has several empirical equations that can be used for the two layer model; however, these equations rely on the use of images which retard the speed of calculations to the point where the overall optimization of the grounding grid (with respect to size and shape) has yet to be determined. The goal of the thesis was to improve upon the current restrictions for the grounding grid design, while minimizing the material (i. e., copper conductors) and installation costs of a grid. The first part of the research examined previous work through a combination of literature review, mathematical computations, and field measurements to validate the theoretical aspects of grid design. The thesis introduces an optimized uniform and two-layer soil with fast accurate calculations directly from soil measurements without the use of graphical methods or the use of complex image theory. Next, the thesis develops enhanced grounding parameter equations using Simpson’s Rule of integration. The final part of the thesis demonstrates how it is possible to optimize the configuration of the grounding grid itself, minimizing costs, and yet still achieving a safe installation. This is the first time such an optimization is possible, and it is made possible by the techniques developed in this thesis. The techniques are applied to existing real-world grid designs, and the results obtained show the effectiveness of the method in reducing construction costs. This thesis shows how these construction and material savings are realized by utilizing a process whereby the grounding design minimizes the overall cost. The overall contribution of this thesis is the optimization of the grounding grid design by eliminating the current restrictions found in the IEEE standards 80 and 81, respectively, and offering an optimized grounding system design, starting from the soil model to the actual grounding design itself...|$|R
