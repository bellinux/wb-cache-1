5000|$|Boston's {{bid for the}} 2024 Olympics {{attracted}} an {{engaged and}} vocal opposition. In December 2013, {{around the same time}} as the state's Feasibility Commission launched, the group No Boston Olympics was formed. No Boston Olympics emphasized the economic risk involved with signing a financial guarantee for the IOC, the corruption of the IOC, and the opportunity costs involved in hosting. In November 2014, another group, No Boston 2024, emerged. No Boston 2024 focused on the social injustices inherent to the modern Olympic process, including displacement, militarization, widening inequality, and the diversion of public spending from basic needs. Although the groups differed in tactics, tone, and emphases, they frequently collaborated around the common goal of defeating the city's Olympic <b>bid.</b> <b>No</b> Boston 2024 was able to shine light on the city's behind-the-scenes work on the bid through numerous public records requests.|$|E
50|$|This variant allows High, Low, Jack, and Off-Jack {{points and}} was {{originally}} meant for cutthroat play. Bids are from 2-4. The bid-winning player can only receive {{the amount of}} points bid with one exception: If the bid-winning player earns points equal to their <b>bid</b> (<b>no</b> higher), he or she receives one extra point towards the total. Non-making players earn points only if the making player is set with one exception: the Off-Jack, which can be claimed by anyone. Finally, players must follow suit in this variant - trumping in is allowed only if a player has no on-suit cards. House rules may permit a game point which is calculated by using the 10s only, such that the player who takes the most 10s is awarded the game point and no player receives this point {{if there is a}} tie. Like the Off-Jack point, the game point can be claimed by any player.|$|E
50|$|In 1913, {{the school}} was wired for {{electricity}} and in 1918, the student body had outgrown the school. The school board originally wished to add on to the school but, after two unsuccessful attempts for <b>bid</b> (<b>no</b> one would bid), the project was abandoned. In 1920, the Board of Public Instruction approved to build a school and principal’s home. The newer school was to be built {{on the corner of}} Line Avenue and Main Street. The bid was given to C.M. Emerson & Co. for a bid of $19,210. The current old school was to be strictly used as a grammar school. In 1921, the new school was built but was only used for a short time. Due to major structural problems, the students were sent back to the 1911 school. In 1930, a new high school was built once again on Main Street and Line Avenue. Citrus High received accreditation as a four-year high school from the State Board of Education. This school housed students until 1985 when a fire struck Citrus High School which nearly burned down the whole campus. The fire was blamed for faulty wiring. Students were placed in temporary portables to finish the school year. Some classes where held in the original 1911 building which is currently owned by Citrus Memorial Hospital. After the fire, Citrus High School was steadily reconstructed until 1992 when construction on the new East and West Wings were completed. Ironically, the original building from the 1930 school resides between these wings.|$|E

40|$|Both the bid {{decision}} and {{the determination of}} the bid price are very important to every contractor. The importance of such decisions lies in the fact that, {{the success or failure of}} a contractor's business depends on the outcomes derived from these decisions. The aim of this paper is to identify and analyze the factors which are believed to affect bidding and markup size decisions in the construction industry in Gaza Strip. A questionnaire survey elicited responses from 77 general contractors. The results indicated that, most of the contractors depend on subjective processes in making bid/no bid and markup size decisions are based on experience-based judgment. Some factors are considered important in both decisions while some other factors are considered important in one decision but not the other. The most important groups which affects <b>bid</b> <b>no</b> bid and mark up size were found to be 'client and consultant of the project' group, and 'project conditions contributing to profitability of the project' group. The results also showed that, the current financial capability of the client, project size and financial status of the company were the main factors affecting <b>bid</b> <b>no</b> bid decisions. Regarding mark up size decision, it was found that the duration of project, political environment, and terms of payment were the main factors affecting the mark up decision.

40|$|The {{approach}} proposed {{focuses on}} the bid/no bid decision linked to the portfolio management issue for an Engineering & Contracting company. A first step is the transposition of the financial concept of Value at Risk {{to the world of}} Engineering and Contracting projects. The distribution of the project Net Present Value over the project lifecycle has been considered, in a similar way as the distribution of return for a portfolio of financial assets over a specified time horizon, in order to define a synthetic measure of risk for an Engineering and Contracting project. The second step is the use of measures of risk based on the Value at Risk concept to support <b>bid</b> <b>no</b> bid decision-making processes in order to obtain a better balancing of the overall portfolio of projects for a company operating in the Engineering & Contracting industry. The proposed framework has been tested as a decision support tool on a power plant project...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} lines of action of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) in Brazil, since its creation in 1959, until the year 2006 (end of the first government Lula), with the main objective of detecting a possible change {{in the mode of}} action of the IADB {{from the end of the}} decade of 80 and the early 90, a period of crisis in Latin America. The hypothesis of this dissertation is that although the IADB has been influenced by the prescriptions of the Washington Consensus and some kind of liberal ideas from the United States during the 70 ¿s- 80 ¿s, the bank¿s roots assured it more independence than others institutions, so that in the case of the IADB, the well-knowned conditionalities in loans were less relevant and contracted with fewer requirements. We believe that the brazilian example is interesting to demonstrate this, because the so-called neoliberal reforms occured later in Brazil than in other Latin American countries; what led us to question what was the real role of international organizations such as the IADB in the process of adopting these reforms. We have chosed the specific case of the IADB because this institution is the largest source of multilateral credit of BrazilEsta dissertação analisa as linhas de atuação do Banco Interamericano de Desenvolvimento (<b>BID)</b> <b>no</b> Brasil, desde sua criação, em 1959, até o ano de 2006 (final do primeiro governo Lula), tendo como preocupação central detectar uma possível mudança no modo de atuação do BID a partir de fins da década de 80 e início dos anos 90, período de crise na América Latina. A hipótese da dissertação é que, embora tenha o BID sido influenciado pelo receituário do ¿Consenso de Washington¿ e por idéias mais liberais oriundas dos Estados Unidos durante os 70 - 80, as raízes do Banco garantiram a ele um papel mais independente do que outras instituições, fazendo com que, no caso do BID, as conhecidas ¿condicionalidades¿ nos empréstimos fossem menos relevantes e contassem com menos exigências. Acreditamos que e exemplo brasileiro é interessante para demonstrar isso, já que as chamadas ¿reformas neoliberais¿ ocorrem mais tardiamente no Brasil do que em outros países da América Latina; o que nos levou a questionar qual fora o real papel de organizações internacionais como o <b>BID</b> <b>no</b> processo de adoção destas reformas.

40|$|Timber {{stumpage}} appraisal is {{an important}} issue in timber markets. Public Forest Services need to set a relevant reserve price and to obtain a fair market value. The hedonic price function approach is a useful method to infer the appraisal timber value since so many characteristics may influence the stumpage price. We adopt the transaction-evidence timber appraisal using data from timber auctions in Lorraine (Eastern France). We propose a Bayesian Metropolis-Gibbs Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithm to estimate parameters of a sample selection model in which the hedonic equation includes a binary endogenous explanatory variable. We use a three simultaneous equation model: equation (1) defines the probability that there is no bid, equation (2) determines among submitted lots if there is only one <b>bid</b> (<b>no</b> competition), equation (3) is the hedonic price equation that explains the highest bid. We find that the MCMC algorithm provides stable results across different model specifications, whereas the Heckman sample selection procedure results in unreliable inference on the coefficient associated with the binary endogenous variable as well as the correlation coefficient. When there is no competition (one bid) the submitted price is- 40. 3 % lower than when there is competition...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin K antagonists, such as {{warfarin}} and phen-procoumon, are the first-line oral anticoagulants {{for primary}} and secondary prevention of cerebral embo-lism in patients with atrial fibrillation. Although vitamin K antagonists can significantly decrease the risk of stroke, their use is limited by several important drawbacks, such as a narrow therapeutic window, the risk of intracranial and gastrointestinal bleeding, interactions {{with a number of}} drugs and nutrients, and the need for regular laboratory tests for therapy adjustment. Currently, new oral anticoagulants, such as direct thrombin inhibitors (e. g., dabigatran) and direct factor Xa inhibitors (e. g., apixaban, rivaroxaban), are being developed and tested in clinical trials. Dabigatran and rivaroxaban were recently approved for prevention of cerebral embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. The ad-vantages of dabigatran in comparison to warfarin are a lower rate of major bleedings with dabigatran 110 mg bid, a better efficacy with dabigatran 150 mg <b>bid,</b> <b>no</b> clinically relevant interactions with other drugs and no need for routine coagulation monitoring. The disadvantages are the absence of antidote and the absence of routine laboratory tests for precise mea-surements of anticoagulant effect of direct thrombin/ factor Xa inhibitors. This review will focus on throm-bin and factor Xa inhibitors, which are new and promising oral anticoagulants for the prevention of cerebral embolism. We will discuss their pharmacol-ogical and clinical properties and provide the most recent updates on their clinical trials...|$|E
