25|$|On 30 January 2005, Libya {{held its}} first round of {{oil and natural gas}} {{exploration}} leases since the US ended sanctions: 15 areas were offered for auctions. In October 2005, a second <b>bidding</b> <b>round</b> was held under EPSA IV, with 51 companies taking part and nearly $500 million worth of new investment flowing into the country as a result. In December 2006, Libya held its third bidding round; however, PSAs were still being signed by NOC as of April 2007. Winners of Libyan exploration area are determined based on how high a share of production a company is willing to offer NOC. Whichever company offers NOC the greatest share of profits is likely to win. In addition, oilfield developers initially bear 100% of costs (exploration, appraisal, and training) for a 5-year minimum, while NOC retains exclusive ownership. Also included in Libyan licensing rounds was open competitive bidding and transparency, joint development and marketing of non-associated natural gas discoveries, standardized terms for exploration and production (E), and non-recoverable bonuses.|$|E
2500|$|Partnership bidding: This variant allows {{partners}} to [...] "talk" [...] during the <b>bidding</b> <b>round</b> and bid as a partnership rather than individuals. The partnership {{that did not}} deal makes their bid first, and the opposing partnership may use this information to craft their bid, although {{the total number of}} tricks bid by both teams does not need to equal 13. The minimum bid is [...] "Board" [...] or 4 tricks, and there is no Nil bidding. Players are allowed to discuss how many tricks they think they can take with each other, but any discussion that identifies specific cards or strength of a particular suit constitutes [...] "cross-boarding" [...] and results in a misdeal, for which the penalty can range from the deal passing to the left to adding a predetermined number of [...] "bags" [...] to the offending partnership to a score penalty of up to 100 points.|$|E
2500|$|The only {{exception}} to this rule is the Ace Check rule. If a player holds three or more Aces in his hand, that player may use the phrase Ace Check during the <b>bidding</b> <b>round.</b> The partner then discloses {{whether or not they}} have an Ace. If the initiating partner can now determine that all four Aces are held within the partnership, he or she may pass a card face down to his or her partner. Doing so creates a special contract where if the partnership retains all 4 Aces after all cards are played for the hand, they receive a 100-point bonus. If not, they receive a 100-point penalty. The Ace Check variant is optional to Partnership Bidding, and is generally only used in combination with [...] "Deuces High" [...] or similar Trump Variants where the Ace of Spades is more difficult to retain since other cards in the deck are assigned a higher rank.|$|E

2500|$|In 1989 Conservative junior {{minister}} James Douglas-Hamilton {{announced a}} <b>bidding</b> <b>round,</b> requested tenders {{to construct a}} toll bridge. A variety of locations and designs were proposed, and the contract was awarded to Miller-Dywidag, a consortium composed of Scottish construction company Miller Construction, German engineering company DYWIDAG Systems International, and financial partner the Bank of America. [...] The Miller-Dywidag proposal (designed in collaboration with civil engineering firm Arup) was for a single-span concrete arch, supported by two piers resting on caissons in the loch and using Eilean Bàn as a stepping-stone. [...] The PFI plan was accepted, and received support from local MP Charles Kennedy and the local council in the full knowledge {{that it would be}} on a high-toll basis for a limited period. [...] Although the bridge itself was built with PFI, the approach roads were the responsibility of the Scottish Office, which paid £15 million for the roads and associated improvements, and to cover the costs associated with decommissioning the ferry. [...] Construction began in 1992 and the bridge was opened by Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Forsyth on 16 October 1995. Then the ferry service ceased, and the bridge and the Mallaig — Armadale ferry were the only year-round connections to the mainland.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the show, four contestants are called from the audience by the announcer to take a spot on the front row behind bidding podiums, which are embedded into the front edge of the stage. This area is known as [...] "Contestants' Row". The announcer shouts [...] "Come on down!" [...] after calling each selected contestant's name, a phrase which has become a trademark of the show. The four contestants in Contestants' Row compete in a <b>bidding</b> <b>round</b> to determine which contestant will play the next pricing game (the round is known as [...] "One Bid," [...] which gets its name and format from one of two types of bidding rounds that existed on the 1950s version of the show). A prize is shown and each contestant gives a single bid for the item. In the first One-Bid game of each episode, bidding begins with the contestant on the viewer's left-to-right. In subsequent One-Bid rounds, the order of bidding still moves from the viewer's left-to-right, but it begins with the contestant most recently called down. Contestants are instructed to bid in whole dollars since the retail price of the item is rounded to the nearest dollar and another contestant's bid cannot be duplicated. If a contestant thinks the others have overbid, he or she bids $1 on the item. The contestant whose bid is closest to the actual retail price of the prize without going over wins that prize and gets to play the subsequent pricing game. If all four contestants overbid, short buzzer tones sound, the lowest bid is announced and the bids are erased. The host then instructs the contestants to re-bid below the lowest previous bid. If a contestant bids the actual retail price, a bell rings and the contestant wins a cash bonus in addition to the prize. From the introduction of the bonus in 1977 until 1998, the [...] "perfect bid" [...] bonus was $100; it was permanently increased to the current $500 in 1998. On The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular, the bonus was $1,000. After each pricing game, another contestant is called to [...] "come on down" [...] to fill the spot of the contestant that won the previous round. The newest contestant bids first in each One Bid round. Contestants who fail to win a One Bid round—thus never making it onstage to play a pricing game—receive consolation prizes, currently $300, often sponsored by companies revealed by the announcer {{near the end of the}} show, before the Showcase.|$|E
50|$|Abacos Pitch is a Pitch variant that {{is gaining}} {{popularity}} in the mid-Atlantic and northeast United States. It varies from classic Pitch as follows: In the <b>bidding</b> <b>round,</b> each player may choose to look or not look at his/her hand before making a decision. At {{the end of the}} <b>bidding</b> <b>round,</b> each player who looked at his/her cards before acting loses one card, chosen at random. Players who lose a card have nothing to play in the sixth and final round of gameplay. Gameplay and scoring after the <b>bidding</b> <b>round</b> proceed exactly as in classic Pitch.|$|E
40|$|This study {{develops}} a dynamic model of bidding behaviour {{to investigate the}} Czech voucher privatization process, {{which took place in}} two waves of <b>bidding</b> <b>rounds,</b> the first in 1992 and the second in 1994. It examines the voucher mechanism from the standpoint of investors and the pricing and allocation of shares. Investors could participate as independent individuals or by assigning some of all of their voucher points to investment privatization funds. Principal findings are that individual participants behaved differently from funds and benefited by learning from one round to the next and from observing the behaviour of the funds. An important collateral finding is that the market, though crude, behaved efficiently in the adjustment of share prices over the <b>bidding</b> <b>rounds.</b> ...|$|R
