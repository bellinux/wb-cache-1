40|$|Energy and angular {{momentum}} can be extracted from a rotating <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> and an accretion disk {{with the presence}} of open magnetic field lines connecting them with remote astrophysical loads. In this paper we investigate the effects of closed magnetic field lines, which connect a <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> with an accretion disk, on the extraction and transportation of energy and {{angular momentum}}. We find that, {{with the presence of}} such kind of closed magnetic field lines, energy and angular momentum can be extracted from the <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> and transported to the accretion disk if the <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> rotates rapidly enough. So a part of the energy extracted from the disk essentially comes from the rotational energy of the <b>black</b> <b>hole.</b> This provides a way for extracting energy from a <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> through an accretion disk. With very low accretion rate a state could exist for which the energy extracted from the disk balances the energy deposited into the disk by the <b>black</b> <b>hole.</b> In such a case the whole power of the disk essentially comes from the rotational energy of the <b>black</b> <b>hole.</b> For a slowly rotating <b>black</b> <b>hole,</b> energy and angular momentum are transferred from the disk to the <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> and so the <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> is spun up.
