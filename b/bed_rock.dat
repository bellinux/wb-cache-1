25|$|Darwin {{predicted}} that underneath each lagoon {{would be a}} <b>bed</b> <b>rock</b> base, {{the remains of the}} original volcano. Subsequent drilling proved this correct. Darwin's theory followed from his understanding that coral polyps thrive in the clean seas of the tropics where the water is agitated, but can only live within a limited depth range, starting just below low tide. Where the level of the underlying earth allows, the corals grow around the coast to form what he called fringing reefs, and can eventually grow out from the shore to become a barrier reef.|$|E
2500|$|The Kawarau valley has a {{thin and}} patchy top soil over a <b>bed</b> <b>rock</b> that is schist. [...] Early {{vineyards}} blasted holes into the bare rock of north facing slopes with miners caps to provide planting holes for the vines. [...] These conditions necessitate irrigation {{and make the}} vines work hard for nutrients. [...] This, low cropping techniques and the thermal effect of the rock produces great intensity for the grapes and subsequent wine.|$|E

2500|$|Though it is {{considered}} to be a monolith temple, [...] "temple" [...] is misnomer given that the five rathas were never completed, as evidenced by uncarved <b>bed</b> <b>rock</b> at the pinnacle. Hence, the rathas were neither consecrated nor worship offered. The structure is named after the twins, Nakula and Sahadeva, the last two born of the five Pandava brothers of the epic Mahabharata fame.

2500|$|Chesham {{is located}} in the Chiltern Hills and from its lowest point of [...] above sea level rises up valley sides. It lies at the {{confluence}} of four dry valleys formed by the meltwater {{at the end of the}} last ice age which deposited onto the <b>bed</b> <b>rock</b> of chalk, alluvial gravels, silts, on which the town now sits. Subsequent periods of subsidence and submergence deposited clays and flints. The River Chess is a chalk-stream which rises from three springs; to the north-west along the Pednor Vale at Frogmoor, at Higham Mead to the north of the town, and to the west near the Amersham Road which converge in the town near to East Street. The river was known as the Isen from at least 12th century when it is found contributing to the name to the nearby hamlet of Isenhampstead, later to divide and become the manors of Isenhampstead Chenies and Isenhampstead Latimer and persisting until the 19th century. It has been suggested, but not established, that the old name 'Isen', which derives from the Anglo-Saxon word for iron, refers to the chalybeate or iron-charged spring waters which feed the river Today the streams are culverted and conducted below street level before emerging at Waterside and flowing in a south easterly direction towards Latimer. From there it flows to the north of Chenies and on towards Rickmansworth after which it joins the River Colne.|$|E
60|$|The <b>bed</b> <b>rock</b> had indeed, in {{the course}} of ages, been pounded away by the fall of water, and by the {{boulders}} and rocks brought down in time of flood, and in the deep hole the gold had lodged, a comparatively small proportion being carried away over the lower lip of the basin. When the <b>bed</b> <b>rock</b> was found {{at the lower end of}} the claim, they set to work to clear away and wash the whole surface to that depth, as far as the foot of the rocks on either side of the little amphitheatre.|$|E

60|$|Another {{fortnight}} {{and they}} reached the <b>bed</b> <b>rock.</b> Each day the find had become heavier, but the climax was reached when they touched the rock. It was found that just where {{they reached the}} bottom, the rock which formed the bank bordering the flat came down almost perpendicularly to the level rock which had formed the old bed of the stream. This was worn perfectly smooth {{by the action of}} the water, and in the <b>bed</b> <b>rock</b> was a great caldron scooped out by an eddy of the stream. This was filled up with gravel, among which nuggets of gold were lying thickly; and when its contents were taken to the surface and separated, the gold was found to weigh over three thousand ounces. The lower part of the ground was then dug out to the full size of the claim, and when all this was washed {{it was found that the}} total amount of gold obtained from the claim was over six thousand ounces.|$|E
40|$|The cusp {{catastrophe}} {{model is}} {{proposed in the}} study to evaluate the roof stability factor of natural gas storage cavern in <b>bedded</b> <b>rock</b> salt, which can overcome the shortages of traditional Strength Reduction Finite Element (or difference) Method (SR FEM) that the failure criteria can not be precisely given. The proposed model can greatly improve the calculating precision and has clear physical and mathematical meanings. The numerical simulations of generic natural gas storage caverns in <b>bedded</b> <b>rock</b> salt located in Jiangsu province of China are carried out based on the proposed model to evaluate the stability factor of cavern roof. In addition, parameters are studied to investigate the stability factors as functions of the buried depth, roof span, roof salt thickness and roof salt Young's modulus, overlying nonsalt thickness, overlying non-salt Young's modulus and gas pressure, etc. The examples show that the proposed model is precise and correct, which can meet the actual engineering demands. The stability factor of cavern roof is equidirectional {{with the increase of}} roof salt thickness, roof salt stiffness, overlying nonsalt thickness, overlying non-salt stiffness and gas pressure, but reverse to the increase of buried depth and roof span. Our methods provide a new way to evaluate the roof stability factor of natural gas storage cavern in <b>bedded</b> <b>rock</b> salt...|$|R
30|$|No {{significant}} displacement {{developed in}} the <b>bed</b> <b>rocks</b> and weathered rocks. However, in the weathered soil layer, a sharp increase of lateral displacement was observed during the construction stages, which shows that the past land sliding or failure plane could be redeemable and affect the stability of a slope.|$|R
60|$|The {{condemned}} criminal {{was seated}} on his <b>bed,</b> <b>rocking</b> himself {{from side to}} side, with a countenance more {{like that of a}} snared beast than the face of a man.

60|$|The valleys were {{honeycombed}} with shafts driven down, sometimes {{through a}} hundred feet of gravel, to the <b>bed</b> <b>rock,</b> as it was found much more profitable working this way than in surface-washing. Stage-coaches and teams of waggons were running regularly now along well-made roads. Frank's earnings were therefore smaller {{than they had been}} at first, but they still paid his expenses, and added a few pounds each trip to his account at the bank.|$|E

60|$|The {{next morning}} Mr. Adams {{and his son}} started for San Francisco, and Frank and his party began to work their claims {{from the bottom of}} the shaft. Although they paid well, they proved far less rich than they had expected; they got good returns from the gravel, but found no pockets in the <b>bed</b> <b>rock,</b> which was {{perfectly}} smooth and even. They found that on either side of the Adams' claims the wall of rock behind swept round; this, no doubt, had caused an eddy at this spot, which had worked out the hole in the <b>bed</b> <b>rock,</b> and caused the deposit of so large a quantity of gold here; and, singularly enough, Mr. Adams' dream had led him to take up the exact spot under which alone the gold had been so largely deposited. The party had taken on several hands, and six weeks sufficed to clear out the paying stuff in their claims, and it was found that, after paying all their expenses, there remained eight hundred ounces of gold; a handsome result, but still very far below what they had reason to expect from the richness of the stuff in the claims lying in the centre of their ground.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTangjiashan {{landslide}} is {{a typical}} high-speed landslide hosted on consequent <b>bedding</b> <b>rock.</b> The landslide was induced by Wenchuan earthquake at a medium-steep hill slope. The occurrence of Tangjiashan landslide was basically controlled by the tectonic structure, topography, stratum lithology, slope structure, seismic waves, and strike of river. Among various factors, the seismic loading with great intensity and long duration was dominant. The landslide initiation exhibited the local amplification effect of seismic waves {{at the rear of}} the slope, the dislocation effect on the fault, and the shear failure differentiating effect on the regions between the soft and the hard layers. Based on field investigations and with the employment of the distinct element numerical simulation program UDEC (universal distinct element code), the whole kinetic sliding process of Tangjiashan landslide was represented and the formation mechanism of the consequent rock landslide under seismic loading was studied. The results are helpful for understanding seismic dynamic responses of consequent <b>bedding</b> <b>rock</b> slopes, where the slope stability could be governed by earthquakes...|$|R

60|$|For {{once every}} man was satisfied, {{and it was}} agreed that it was the richest place which had been {{discovered}} in California. But though all were doing well, their finds did not approach those of the party {{at the head of the}} valley. The spot on which these were at work was indeed a natural trap for gold. At the lower end of the claim the <b>bed</b> <b>rock</b> was found at the depth of three feet only; but it sloped rapidly down to the foot of the fall, and here an iron rod had been driven down and showed it to be forty feet below the surface.|$|E

Mr. Portney then carried it to a nearby pool and allowed the water to run over the top, then brushed off the surface and began to [...] "wash down." [...] This took several minutes, and Randy and Earl stood by almost breathless during the process.|$|E

60|$|The litter {{was brought}} {{and the king}} entered it with labouring breath. Passing through the north gate of the Great Place, the party ascended a slope of the hill that lay beyond it till they reached a flat plain some {{hundreds}} of yards in width.

They had great expectations of the results that it would yield when they neared the <b>bed</b> <b>rock,</b> and they at once offered him a hundred ounces for his share, an offer which he accepted. He had already laid by an equal sum, and after paying his passage and that of Jacob to England or India, would have recouped himself for all the expenses of his expedition, and he would have some three or four hundred pounds in hand after the sale of the horses and waggon.|$|E

If--as one theory had been held--the disturbance was kept up by a band of concealed marauders or road agents, whose purpose was to preserve their haunts from intrusion, we were quite able to pay them back in kind for any assault. I need not say that the boys were delighted with this prospect when the fact was revealed to them. The only one doubtful or apathetic spirit there was our host, who quietly resumed his seat and his book, with his old expression of patient martyrdom. It would have been easy for me to have drawn him out, but I felt that I did not want to corroborate anybody else's experience; only to record my own.
