500|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} {{set to be}} distributed under the title Cop Killer, named for {{the song of the}} same name, which criticizes violent police officers. During the production of the album, Warner Bros. executives were aware of the potential controversy that the album and song could cause, but supported it. At a Time-Warner shareholders' meeting, actor Charlton Heston stood and read lyrics from the song [...] "KKK Bitch" [...] to an astonished audience and demanded that the company take action. Sire responded by changing the title to Body Count, but did not remove the song. In an article for the Washington Post, Tipper Gore condemned Ice-T for songs like [...] "Cop Killer," [...] writing that [...] "Cultural economics were a poor excuse for the South's continuation of slavery. Ice-T's financial success cannot excuse the vileness of his message [...] Hitler's anti-Semitism sold in Nazi Germany. That didn't make it right." [...] The Dallas Police Association and the Combined Law Enforcement Association of Texas launched a campaign to force Warner Bros. Records to withdraw the album. CLEAT called for a boycott of all products by Time-Warner in order to secure the removal of the song and album from stores. Within a week, they were joined by police organizations across the United States. Ice-T asserted that the song was written {{from the point of view}} of a fictional character, and told reporters that [...] "I ain't never killed no cop. I felt like it a lot of times. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> it. If you believe that I'm a cop killer, you believe David Bowie is an astronaut," [...] in reference to Bowie's song [...] "Space Oddity".|$|E
2500|$|Ice-T stated of the song, [...] "I'm {{singing in}} the first person as a {{character}} who is fed up with police brutality. I ain't never killed no cop. I felt like it a lot of times. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> it. If you believe that I'm a cop killer, you believe David Bowie is an astronaut," [...] in reference to Bowie's song [...] "Space Oddity".|$|E
2500|$|Hathcock {{once said}} that he survived in his work because of an ability to [...] "get in the bubble", to put himself {{into a state of}} [...] "utter, complete, {{absolute}} concentration", first with his equipment, then his environment, in which every breeze and every leaf meant something, and finally on his quarry. After the war, a friend showed Hathcock a passage written by Ernest Hemingway: [...] "Certainly there is no hunting like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and like it, never really care for anything else thereafter." [...] He copied Hemingway's words on a piece of paper. [...] "He got that right," [...] Hathcock said. [...] "It was the hunt, not the killing." [...] Hathcock said in a book written about his career as a sniper: [...] "I like shooting, and I love hunting. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> enjoy killing anybody. It's my job. If I don't get those bastards, then they're gonna kill a lot of these kids dressed up like Marines. That's the way I look at it." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{opened the}} bag and packed the boots in; and then, just as I was going to close it, a horrible idea {{occurred}} to me. Had I packed my tooth-brush? I don’t know how it is, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> know whether I’ve packed my tooth-brush.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes--a long walk--for {{though the}} {{distance}} is only sixteen {{miles on the}} straight--that is, eight to the furthest place and eight back, what with {{the ins and outs}} to the gentlemen's houses, it makes two-and-twenty for my legs. Two-and-twenty miles a day, how many a year? I used to reckon it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> now. <b>I</b> don't care to think o' my wear and tear, now it do begin to tell upon me.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Puciato later {{commented on}} the act saying; “It was {{early in the day}} and as most people, you kind of get that out of the way early in the day <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did.</b> I made a point to hold onto it. And you know the turtle, the {{malicious}} turtle, was pretty easy to fire that fucker right out of the hole. There was no way in hell that I thought that we were ever going make a living doing this or that in fourteen years I would still be having a conversation as Greg from Dillinger Escape Plan. I just thought this was a ball of fire that’s gonna implode or it’s got a shelf life, there’s no way this can continue. So when we would get asked to play something like that in my head I was like ‘well, this is never going to happen again, when am I ever going to play a festival with bands I don’t like. That was kind of the other thing, {{that was the first time}} we ever played with bands we don’t like. Up until then it was like you go on tour with bands you feel a kinship with and we had never been exposed to some like mass thing where you’re playing with a band like Puddle of Mudd or whoever it was at the time who made me feel like [...] "Oh I got to make some kind of a statement." [...] So it was kind of a combo of kind of wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we’re obviously never going to do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we’re never allowed to do this again anyway. And then just kind of making a statement in a way that I felt would be unavoidable for people to pay attention to.” ...|$|E
60|$|I don't deny you're plump, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> like a scrag. Perhaps it's {{the last}} chance we shall ever have.|$|E
6000|$|... "Strange!" [...] said Trench, in {{open-mouthed}} surprise, [...] "I've {{often heard}} of coincidences, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> {{see or hear}} of the like of that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> what <b>I</b> ought, a fact {{for which}} I am {{grateful}} {{now come to}} think of it, since otherwise I should not be here to-night. I wish to make the worst of myself, the very worst, for whatever I am not, at least I am honest. Now having told you that I am, or was half an hour ago, an idler, a good-for-nothing, prospectless failure, I ask you--if you care to hear any more?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Many artists take a {{few years}} to regroup between albums <b>but</b> <b>I</b> had <b>never</b> <b>done</b> that. <b>I</b> had been recording, writing, touring and {{promoting}} albums for 11 years straight! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My Lord Duke," [...] replied March, [...] "when {{the service}} of the King {{requires}} it, I can ride with ten times as many horse as your Grace has named; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>done</b> so either traitorously to entrap the King nor boastfully to overawe other nobles." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> equalise the disadvantage, {{and perhaps}} it's as well, for I fancy {{that sort of}} revenge cuts both people too much for a {{rational}} man to seek it....|$|E
60|$|So I {{came away}} then, {{because he was}} looking tired. Overwork, I reckon; I never do that; I have seen the evil effects of it. My mother was always afraid I would {{overwork}} myself, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well now," [...] said Hockins, gasping forth {{his morning}} yawn {{in spite of}} circumstances, [...] "I've many a time read and heard it of other folk, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> think I should live to hear my own chains rattle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Psha! {{you know}} what I mean. I might have had the {{feelings}} of a gentleman {{as well as the}} best man that ever was born. <b>I</b> haven't; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>done</b> anything so mean as gambling. Now I have got something else to tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; I {{will not}} be called Julia. If you do, I will be insulted, and leave you instantly. I may call you Harry, as being so much younger--though we {{were born in the}} same month--and as a sort of cousin. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>never</b> <b>do</b> that after to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|Eunice's eyes {{rested on}} me in vacant surprise. [...] "How do you know?" [...] she asked. [...] "I hear her; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> see her. <b>Do</b> you see her?" ...|$|R
60|$|I grew {{very fond}} of Mr. Wood, and even of his thin little wife, who {{occasionally}} flitted into the room after we had finished. I fully intended {{to keep up with}} them in after life, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did.</b> I forgot them completely....|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; I told Thomas," [...] she said. [...] "No; it's only {{a country}} school. Once I thought I should {{go down to}} the State Normal School, and study drawing there; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did.</b> Are you--are you a painter, Mr. Staniford?" ...|$|E
60|$|FAITH. Ah! [Staring at him] I used {{to stand}} behind my door. I'd stand there {{sometimes}} I don't know how long. I'd listen and listen--the noises are all hollow in a prison. You'd think you'd get used to being shut up, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1964, he {{left his}} {{corporate}} practice for several weeks to represent several black civil rights workers who were being sued for libel in northern Mississippi. He later said: [...] "I probably did work that was more intellectually challenging later on, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> probably <b>never</b> <b>did</b> any work that was more exciting." ...|$|R
5000|$|Some Mets {{fans have}} {{also pointed out}} that Heath Bell floundered during Peterson's tenure as the Mets {{pitching}} coach yet thrived immediately after leaving the Mets, even becoming an All-Star with the San Diego Padres in 2009. [...] "Everything in New York was so serious", Bell said. [...] "I should keep my mouth shut, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>do.</b> In 2005, <b>I</b> didn't pitch for 28 straight days. I don't know if I did something to Willie then the manager of the Mets. I didn't always get along with pitching coach Rick Peterson.". Baseball Prospectus listed Bell as one of its [...] "Five players to watch in 2005"—along with Justin Morneau, D'Angelo Jiménez, Dan Haren, and Josh Beckett. After a poor 2005 season, however, Bell's game appearances declined from 42 in 2005 to 22 in 2006 before he was traded.|$|R

I think I kept you in at recess, however." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{have his}} address. Wait, I'll look," [...] end Sam pulled a little {{notebook}} {{out of his}} pocket. [...] "He asked me to write to him some time, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> more than mail him a postal. Yes, here is the address." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, Miss Jane; he {{came into}} the shop, and bought some bread. He paid for it honestly; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> see any one so dirty. And there's Alfred wishing to be like him. I knew you would tell him it is quite wicked, Miss Jane.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{would like}} it," [...] I said; [...] "that is, if it's the real thing. I've often {{read it in}} books, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> heard it. <b>Do</b> {{you think it will}} be {{dangerous}} to go unprotected among those characters?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{not only}} read last Friday, when I was {{doubtful}} {{of being able}} to do so, <b>but</b> read as <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> before, and astonished the audience quite as much as myself. You never saw or heard such a scene of excitement.|$|R
5000|$|For instance, Quentin Tarantino, when {{speaking}} about Scorsese's {{collaboration with the}} Basses, has said:"Saul Bass was undoubtedly the greatest title sequence maker. Brilliant - just brilliant. He has been a 'hero' for years.

'Why, as to that, you know, Pinch,' {{pursued the}} other, {{stirring}} the fire again, and speaking in his rapid, off-hand way; 'it's all very right and proper to be fond of parents {{when we have}} them, and to bear them in remembrance after they're dead, if you have ever known anything of them. <b>But</b> as <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> know anything about mine personally, you know, why, I can't {{be expected to be}} very sentimental about 'em.
