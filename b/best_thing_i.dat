2500|$|Although Lambert was not Newman's {{first choice}} {{to produce the}} series — Don Taylor and Shaun Sutton had both {{declined}} the position — he was very keen to ensure that Lambert took the job after his experience of working with her at ABC.

[...] When unveiled in Paris at the 1884 Salon, it aroused such a negative reaction that it likely prompted Sargent's move to London. Sargent's self-confidence had led him to attempt a risque experiment in portraiture—but this time it unexpectedly back-fired. The painting was not commissioned by her and he pursued her for the opportunity, quite unlike most of his portrait work where clients sought him out. Sargent wrote to a mutual acquaintance: ...|$|E
