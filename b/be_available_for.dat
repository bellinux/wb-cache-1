5|$|Before the duel, Hamilton wrote {{a defense}} of his {{decision}} to duel {{while at the same}} time intending to throw away his shot.

He attempted to reconcile his moral and religious reasons and the codes of honor and politics. He intended to accept the duel and throw away his fire in order to satisfy his morals and political codes, respectively. His desire to <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> future political matters also played a factor.|$|E
