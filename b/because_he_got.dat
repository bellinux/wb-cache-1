5|$|The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, February 17, 2014, {{the first}} episode. Fallon had several celebrities come {{on stage and}} give him $100 bills paying off bets that they lost <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> to host The Tonight Show. Colbert was the last celebrity and he came with $100 in a bucket of pennies, pouring them down Fallon's clothes.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Grace and Jack are {{discussing}} their own problems. Grace uses Jack's promiscuous history with married men {{as a legitimate}} reason to have {{an affair with a}} married man, but Jack tells her to forget about it as both of them are the moral role models to their friends. After being honest with her, Jack confesses that the reason he is wearing an eye patch is not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> glitter in his eye, as he told his friends. When he refused to stop his singing performance during the debut of his new talk show, Jack Talk, even though the entire set had accidentally been set on fire, his eyebrow was burnt off. Later, Will, Grace, and Jack all decide that it would be for the best to let Karen know the truth about Stan. Will breaks the news to her, but Karen believes he is joking. Rosario tells Karen that Stan is not dead, as she has been giving him reports on Karen. At the admission, Karen fires Rosario and leaves Will's apartment with Malcolm, explaining that Stan may be alive, but that he is still dead to her.|$|E
25|$|One Ranger, seventeen-year-old , {{who wanted}} to be in on the action, also died in the fighting. He was the son of camp cook, D. R. Smith and the {{youngest}} Ranger ever to die in the line of duty. Smith was apparently too inexperienced to fully appreciate McNelly's terse orders <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> too close to a wounded Mexican bandit; the bandit killed the boy before Smith even knew what was happening. Berry Smith was buried in the northwest corner of the Brownsville cemetery on June 16 with full military honors. The funeral was recorded as one of the finest the city had ever seen.|$|E
2500|$|... "Morales is {{dancing in}} the opening seconds but is that <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> a second wind or <b>because</b> <b>he</b> still doesn't know where he is. He did head to the wrong corner {{at the end of}} the last round.|$|R
6000|$|ANN. [Jumping on to {{the dais}} with disgust.] Oh, dear! When I'm {{trying to get you}} away from all this atmosphere. I don't so much mind the Vicar knowing, <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> a weak heart---- ...|$|R

25|$|Despite limited on-field {{success in}} Ewbank's first years, the Jets began {{to put the}} pieces of a winning team in place. In 1964, they outbid {{cross-town}} NFL rivals the New York Giants for Matt Snell, a top running back prospect out of Ohio State University. Linebacker Larry Grantham became a consistent All-Pro selection and safety Dainard Paulson had 12 interceptions in 1964, which remains a team record. An even bigger coup came in 1965, when the Jets signed Joe Namath, a star quarterback at Alabama under coach Bear Bryant. The St. Louis Cardinals selected Namath as the 12th pick in the NFL draft, but Namath later said he chose the Jets in part <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> along with Ewbank and was impressed by how he had developed Unitas while with the Colts.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} U.S. {{version is}} that bin Laden's location at Abbottabad was {{identified by the}} CIA by tracking an al-Qaeda courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Hersh reports that in August 2010 a former senior Pakistani intelligence officer walked into the office of Jonathan Bank, the CIA station chief at the US embassy in Islamabad and betrayed the secret of bin Laden's whereabouts in return {{for part of the}} $25 million reward, and has since been relocated with his family to Washington and is a consultant to the CIA. The ISI had captured bin Laden in 2006; he had lived undetected from 2001 to 2006 with some of his wives and children in the Hindu Kush mountains. The ISI got to him by paying some of the local tribal people to betray him. Bin Laden was very ill and was living as prisoner under ISI control in the garrison town of Abbottabad less than two miles from Pakistan's National Military Academy at Kakul (equivalent of United States Military Academy at West Point). The Saudi government also knew about Osama's presence in Abbottabad and had advised the Pakistanis to keep him as a prisoner and gave financial assistance. Major Amir Aziz, a Pakistani Army doctor, was ordered to move near his compound to provide treatment. Aziz was also given a share of the $25 million reward <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the DNA sample which conclusively proved that it was bin Laden. A real casualty in the whole affair was the doctor named Shakil Afridi. His perfectly legitimate hepatitis B vaccination programme was claimed to be the way the US obtained bin Laden's DNA. Afridi became the sacrificial lamb because the US wanted to protect its real CIA informant, Amir Aziz, who had been held by the Pakistanis. Afridi was sentenced to 33 years by the Pakistanis. Other vaccination programmes were canceled once this lie was put forth.|$|E
500|$|Some time later, Andy meets up with Nate, who {{is moving}} to Boston <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> a new job as the sous chef of a restaurant. They agree to start dating again {{and see what the}} future holds. The same day, Andy is interviewed and is {{accepted}} to work at a major New York publication company. The editor recounts how he called Runway for a reference on Andy, and got a response from Miranda herself. Miranda described Andy as [...] "her biggest disappointment"- and said that the editor would be [...] "an idiot" [...] if he didn't hire her. Emily is offered her Paris wardrobe by Andy and the two leave on good terms. Andy passes the [...] "Runway" [...] office building and sees Miranda get into a car. Andy gives a wave, but Miranda does not acknowledge her. Andy is used to this and instead walks further into the crowd. Once inside the car, however, Miranda smiles and then orders her chauffeur to drive.|$|E

5|$|In {{regards to}} {{composing}} {{the song and}} its lyrical meaning, Allen noted that, Mark's got a very good ear. He's very relaxed {{in the studio and}} very thoughtful. There's not really any pressure working there, <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> his own studio so he doesn't have time constraints.|$|R
5000|$|Arquin is {{a strong}} player known to be good {{in the air and}} {{comfortable}} using both feet. Notts County defender Dean Leacock likened Arquin to Nicolas Anelka. [...] "A lot of us call him Anelka <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> so much skill - and he's quite stroppy too!".|$|R
2500|$|Early in the 2000 season, Maddux {{was asked}} by sportswriter Bob Nightengale {{what had been the}} most memorable at-bat of his {{pitching}} career. Maddux said it was striking out Dave Martinez to end a regular season game. Nightengale was surprised Maddux hadn't picked a postseason game, or a more famous player. Maddux explained: [...] "I remember that one <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> a hit off me in the same situation (full count, bases loaded, two out in the 9th inning) seven years earlier. I told myself if I ever got in the same situation again, I'll pitch him differently. It took me seven years, but I got him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Off-screen, Mead {{had taken}} a one-year hiatus from the show in order {{to spend more time}} with his {{daughter}} and [...] "pursue other projects". Mead chose to leave the show <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> [...] "itchy feet" [...] and decided to return to theatre. Producers tried to persuade Mead to remain with the show and offered to extend his contract by a further two years, but he wanted {{to spend more time with}} his daughter as she grew older. Describing his experience with the show, Mead said it had been [...] "amazing". Mead reassured fans of the show that [...] "Lofty’s job is still there" [...] so he could return to the show and promised to return to the serial. Despite this, Mead said in an interview with Elaine Reilly of What's on TV that his return had not been confirmed and there was a possibility he may not reprise the role. Mead's official website described his break as [...] "a 12-month leave of absence". In September 2016, Mead expressed his interest in reprisng the role. He reflected on the role in May 2017, commenting that he missed the show as he created [...] "strong bonds" [...] on the show.|$|E

"Well, it {{all depends}} upon one's {{conception}} of happiness, of course," [...] Julien replied, [...] "but so far as I am concerned, {{let me tell you}} that the idea of a girl like Anne married to an insufferable bounder like Harbord, just <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> millions of money, simply made me boil." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{heard about}} Martin having an {{agreement}} with Truro that if a League club came in for him, {{he was allowed to}} leave.

6000|$|The {{brakeman}} {{was struck}} with this idea. [...] "There's where you're right. A fellow don't take {{that kind of}} a job for the fun of it.

6000|$|... "He is a cross old man," [...] added Hubert. [...] "He said {{children}} {{ought not}} to be allowed on the esplanade, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> into the way as I was pushing the perambulator." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Anyhow, {{you read}} papers before learned bodies {{and have them}} printed. And you come with as silly a story as a Staffordshire peasant who thinks someone {{has been trying to}} poison him <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> a stomach-ache.

"Man is {{the boss}} <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> the head that thinks," [...] Collins preached the lesson; [...] "and <b>he's</b> just <b>got</b> {{to make his}} head boss his body, that's all, {{so that he can}} think one thought ahead of the animal, and act one act ahead. Watch me get his goat. He ain't the hard case he's trying to make himself believe he is. And that idea, which he's just starting, has got to be taken out of him. The broomstick will do it.

However, Grilli heard boos at Comerica Park during the season, mostly due to his home ERA of 7.96. He was much more effective away from home, posting a 1.91 ERA in road games.
