60|$|It {{was a warm}} {{night in}} September, and Wilmet had laid herself down in bed in her nursery with a careful, but not an oppressed heart. About many matters she was happier than before. Her mother had revived in some degree, could walk from her bed-room to the sitting-room, and took more {{interest}} in what was passing; and this the hopeful spirits of the children interpreted into signs of recovery. Geraldine's health and spirits had evidently taken a start for the better. Fulbert, too, was off her mind--safe gone to a clergy-orphan foundation; and though Lancelot {{had not yet been}} elected, owing, Mr. Audley imagined, to Lady Price's talk about their fine friends, Wilmet could not be sorry, he was such a little fellow, and the house would be so dull without his unfailing merriment and oddities. And though there had been sore disappointment that Mrs. Thomas Underwood had chosen to go to Brighton instead of coming home, there was the promise of a visit from Alda before Christmas to feed upon. Little Robina had come home for the summer holidays, well, happy, and improved, and crying only in a satisfactory way on returning to school. Moreover, Wilmet's finances had been pleasantly increased by an unexpected present of five pounds {{at the end of the}} half year from Miss Pearson, and the promise of the like for the next; increasing as her usefulness increased; and she was also allowed to bring Angela to school with her. The <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> at Midsummer had been satisfactory, and Felix had proudly pronounced her to be a brick of a housekeeper. And thus altogether Wilmet did not feel that the weight of care was so heavy and hopeless as when it first descended upon her; and she went to bed as usual, feeling how true her father's words of encouragement and hope had been, how kind friends were, how dear a brother Felix was, and above all, how there is verily a Father of the fatherless. And so she fell fast asleep, but was ere long waked by a voice from the inner room where Cherry slept with the door open.|$|E

5000|$|Furthermore, if {{the auditor}} {{believes}} E and B are 100 thousand {{dollars on the}} average {{with a standard deviation}} 5 and the covariance 15, we can represent the belief as a multivariate normal distribution. If historical data indicate that the residual R is zero on the average {{with a standard deviation of}} 0.5 thousand dollars, we can summarize the historical data by normal distribution R ~ N(0, 0.52). If there is a direct observation on cash receipts, we can represent the evidence as an equation say, C = 50 (thousand dollars). If the auditor knows nothing about the beginning <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> receivable, we can represent his or her ignorance by a vacuous LBF. Finally, if historical data suggests that, given cash receipts C, the sales S is on the average 8C + 4 and has a standard deviation 4 thousand dollars, we can represent the knowledge as a linear regression model S ~ N(4 + 8C, 16).|$|E

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to slaughter and dress meat livestock in slaughter houses to serve it as meat. As long as slaughter houses are utilized by the resident users to serve meat to resident consumers, they might be managed as public facilities where slaughtering charge was set at so low that its revenue was far short of its cost. The <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> was made from the general revenue which resident people paid as tax. As meat marketing areas have been widened due to technological progress in transportation, communication and cold storage, the new condition has evolved that non-resident users enter into the slaughter houses and considerable amount of meat is distributed to other areas. As a result of this, {{it has not been}} appropriate to justify the current principle of marketing the accounts balance at the expence of tax revenue. The three methods of establishing the rate of slaughtering charge which regarded as appropriate to the new marketing conditions are examined by using the data of Buzen Municipal Slaughter House, Fukuoka Prefecture. The first method is to raise the rate at the level where the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> can be achieved. The second one is to establish the different rate between resident users and non-resident users. The third one is to achieve the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> by both public expenditure and charges paid at the different rate between resident users and non-resident users. It is concluded that the third method is regarded as the most appropriate in considering its workability. 食肉は他の生鮮食料品と異なり,と畜解体および加工処理の過程が必要である. つまりと畜場は,食肉流通においては必要不可欠の施設である. 以前のと畜場は地元消費のためのと畜がほとんどであつた. したがつて,地元福祉の観点からと畜場使用料も低く決められ,現在ほとんどのと畜場の経営収支は赤字である. ところが最近になつて地元消費だけでなく,地元外出荷のためのと畜が増加し,と畜場使用料についても経営採算を度外視した低水準に決めるやり方について再検討の必要が大きくなつている. このような観点から本稿では次の 2 点を中心に分析を行つた. 第 1 に赤字経営に悩まされている地方公営と畜場の経営実態の把握とその背景の分析を行つた. 第 2 に地元福祉を重視した低料金制の代わりにいかなる考え方に基づいてどの程度の水準の料金を決あたらよいかについて,公共経済学の理論に依拠して考察した. 本稿は以前に福岡県内と畜場の実態分析を行つた黒木(1978) の成果に基づき,さらにその深化を計つたものである...|$|E

The average collection period and aging schedule are two widely used gauges of accounts receivable collection performance. These performance measures are deficient, however, especially when used for internal evaluation, as {{a change in the}} average collection period or the composition of an aged schedule does not necessarily relate to a change in collection efficiency. This study proposes refinements to these metrics. In the case of the ageing schedule, it is proposed that accounts receivable values should be related to their original credit sales.
