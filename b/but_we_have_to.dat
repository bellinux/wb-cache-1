Boyack kept her role in Local Government and Planning.

500|$|The Flaming Lips {{began work}} on Zaireeka in April 1997 in the then-new Tarbox Road Studios. Initially, the band was {{frustrated}} while making the album. Even after diverting half of the budget for the next album into Zaireeka, there were no tangible results. [...] The band experienced difficulty writing songs for the album. [...] Finally, Coyne exclaimed [...] "Look, we don't have to be friends... <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make this record!" [...] While this philosophy aided progress, the band only began to complete songs when they learned to write for the medium as opposed to trying to split normal songs across four CDs.|$|E
500|$|After a {{creative}} spurt in October resulted in new song ideas, Bono {{proposed that the}} group release a double album. The Edge said: [...] "There would have been two records, depending on which songs we decided to finish. There was this one album, the 'blues' album that Bono was talking about, and another, much more 'European', {{which is kind of}} the way I was led." [...] Eno cautioned the group about pursuing the material, telling the Edge: [...] "I know that any one of these new ideas is good enough to make the record, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> draw the line somewhere. If we even consider any of them we'll still be here in three months time." [...] U2 relented, shelving the new songs to avoid missing their deadline to complete the album. Recording for The Joshua Tree wrapped up in November 1986. Rough mixes had been created throughout the sessions after each song was recorded to, in Lanois' words, take [...] "snapshots along the way ... because sometimes you go too far". The Edge explained that the arrangement and production of each song was approached individually and that while there was a strong uniform direction, they were prepared to [...] "sacrifice some continuity to get the rewards of following each song to a conclusion".|$|E
500|$|This led to Boycott {{being dropped}} from the side and forced to return to England, despite apologising via a note to the England {{dressing}} room. He claimed in his autobiography, however, {{that he went to}} the golf course following medical advice to get fresh air. Later in 1982 he was instrumental in organising, in defiance of a United Nations and a TCCB ban, a so-called [...] "rebel" [...] tour of apartheid South Africa by 13 current and former England Test cricketers, who were almost all nearing the end of their careers. All the players were banned from international cricket for three years as a result. By the mid-1980s, with Boycott in good county form and physical shape, there was speculation that he might return to the England side. David Gower, England captain of the time, stated, however, that [...] "Geoffrey's been a marvellous servant for England <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> look to the future and, in view of his age, it wouldn't make an awful lot of sense to pick him again." [...] This was confirmed by the return of Graham Gooch and Tim Robinson's 175 against Australia at Leeds, which prompted Botham, who had once remarked that Boycott was [...] "totally, almost insanely, selfish", to sing [...] "Bye-bye Boycott" [...] from the England balcony.|$|E

[...] So America is at a crossroads. [...] We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us. [...] We have to be mindful of James Madison’s warning that “No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.” [...] <...> In Afghanistan, we will complete our transition to Afghan responsibility for that country’s security. <...> [...] Beyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a boundless “global war on terror,” but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America. [...] In many cases, this will involve partnerships with other countries.″ Nevertheless, in the same speech, in a bid to emphasise the legality of military actions undertaken by the U.S., noting that Congress had authorised the use of force, he went on to say, ″Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces.
