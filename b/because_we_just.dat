The songs were produced and recorded {{for the most part}} at Olympic Studios in Barnes, London. At this time, the Autotune facility was not available and most of the vocals were recorded with few adjustments made afterwards, as Wilson remembers: [...] "Because of the fact we were not using computers, we had to work them very hard. They were in that recording booth for hours <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> had to get the right take".|$|E
500|$|Godsmack headlined {{the fourth}} annual Mayhem Festival {{alongside}} Disturbed. The band entered the studio in January 2012 to mix a live album plus record several covers {{for an upcoming}} release. The band then went on tour in the spring with Staind. Godsmack has completed work on an EP of cover songs. Godsmack released their new live album Live & Inspired on May 15, 2012. The set included a bonus EP of cover tracks. In January 2013, Erna announced a short solo tour through America. In February, Sully {{said in an interview}} that Godsmack would take a break during 2013.

500|$|... "Fishsticks" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creator Trey Parker. The concept for [...] "Fishsticks" [...] began when Parker, fellow co-creator Matt Stone, and actor Bill Hader attended a writers' retreat in Seattle, Washington and they visited a body of water where they could watch salmon jump. They started joking about a salmon wearing an outfit like the motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel, which eventually reminded them of the music video for rapper Kanye West's song [...] "Touch the Sky", in which West himself dresses like Knievel. This led to them picturing a scene with West on a news program, angrily denying reports that he is a fish, shouting [...] "No, I am not a salmon!" [...] During a four-hour ride in a car, Stone and Parker discussed the joke further, and eventually thought of the [...] "fishsticks" [...] joke that featured prominently in the final episode. The duo said they found it hilarious and told variations of the joke back and forth to each other {{for the rest of the}} ride. Stone said, [...] "The van driver we hired was just so bummed <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> kept talking about fishsticks, 'You're a gay fish', over and over. We thought it was so funny, and just the fact that he didn't get it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Enigk confessed in an {{interview}} in December 2008 that because the band had already broken up during the recording of LP2, he and Hoerner never sat down to complete the lyrics; [...] "We broke up and we just felt like we were done. We put no energy into the artwork or into anything. On a lot of songs, there aren’t lyrics! In a lot of cases, we never sat down to write them, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> wanted {{to get it out of}} the way as fast as possible. So I just sang a lot of gibberish, which makes it really quirky. My favorite is the Japanese translations".|$|E

2500|$|Murray {{never played}} much {{basketball}} before the show, and was more into football while in high school. Because of this, a basketball coach was hired for Murray {{in order to}} improve his basketball skills. To go along with the character's personality, a [...] "sedate" [...] wardrobe was designed. Schwahn said of Lucas's wardrobe, [...] "...He was a Levi's guy. He was, you know, he wore a lot of, like, plain T-shirts and things <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> wanted him to represent the everyman." [...] Despite having the character start out this way, the series eventually let his wardrobe evolve. Starting from the fourth season on, he was given some [...] "wilder stuff". Schwahn clarified, [...] "You know, he can [...] rock something from Sean John, which normally would have been Nathan's department." [...] He said the style of the characters really does evolve on the show, especially with the four-year timeline jump. [...] "Diesel is so wonderful on [...] Diesel jeans. It's an Italian company. A lot of times, Italian designers cut much more slimly...for a really lean physique," [...] stated One Tree Hill's costume designer, Carol Cutshall. [...] "Also, this year, they’ve had nice long sleeves and nice long shirts and really slim clothing and that looks best on [...] He doesn’t need to be swallowed up. He's got his own style as a person. It's not just up to me. I try to bring in what I think is going to fit him best."
