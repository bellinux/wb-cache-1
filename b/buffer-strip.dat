40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{based on the}} classical shear-lag assumptions is used to study the residual strength and fracture behavior of composite laminates with symmetrically placed buffer strips. The laminate is loaded by a uniform remote longitudinal tensile strain and has initial damage {{in the form of}} a transverse crack in the parent laminate between buffer strips. The crack growth behavior as a function of material properties, number of <b>buffer-strip</b> plies, spacing, width of buffer strips, longitudinal matrix splitting, and debonding at the interface is studied. <b>Buffer-strip</b> laminates are shown to arrest fracture and increase the residual strengths significantly over those of one material laminates, with S-glass being a more effective buffer strip material than Kevlar in increasing the damage tolerance of graphite/epoxy panels. For a typical graphite/epoxy laminate with S-glass buffer-strips, the residual strength is about 2. 4 times the residual strength of an all graphite/epoxy panel with the same crack length. Approximately 50 % of this increase is due to the S-glass/epoxy buffer-strips, 40 % due to longitudinal splitting of the buffer strip interface and 10 % due to bonding...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the {{agriculture}} of the future, {{there is a}} compelling place for agroecologically-based practices alongside practices based on the best available chemical, genetic, and engineering components. This paper explores this issue {{in the context of}} the development and spread of a conservation farming system based on natural vegetative contour buffer strips in smallholder production systems in southeast Asia. Farmers adapted contour hedgerow farming practices into a simpler, <b>buffer-strip</b> system as a labor-saving measure to conserve soil and sustain yields on steeply sloping cropland in Claveria, Mindanao, Philippines. Permanent-ridge tillage systems were also adapted to smallholder farming systems by researchers. Natural vegetative buffer strips resulted in gradually increasing yields, with an estimated benefit of 0. 5 t/ha/crop. They were seen to increase land values, facilitate investment in more intensive and profitable cropping systems, and expand the land base for food crop agriculture. They induced an institutional innovation of farmer-led Landcare organizations, which have spread this and other agroforestry practices to thousands of households in the southern Philippines...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{deals with}} a {{monitoring}} of farming landscape changes during the decade 1999 - 2009, focusing on grassy habitats. The 'Parc Naturel Regional de Lorraine' (PNRL) is a territory of 2200 km 2 located in north-eastern France, dominated by agricultural areas. The preservation of landscapes and natural habitats {{is one of these}} purposes. PNRL and the Laboratoire Agronomie & Environnement developed a GIS methodology in order to set up a long-term landscape observatory. A representative sample of the variety of landscape contexts was designed, giving an 80 km 2 monitored area in the PNRL. The main significant results of this 10 -year study concern changes of grassy habitats: grassland area decreased and grassland fragmentation increased, which confirms the same global pattern at the European scale. In the same way, heterogeneity of landscape globally decreased. All of these changes are known to have negative impacts on biodiversity. On the other hand, we show some positive changes: area of grass <b>buffer-strips</b> along rivers increased, due to new CAP rules...|$|R
40|$|Soil erosion/sedimentation is {{a colossal}} {{problem that has}} menaced water {{resources}} development in the Nile, particularly in Eastern Nile (Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt). An insight into soil erosion/sedimentation mechanism and mitigation methods plays an indispensable role for the sustainable water resources development in the region. This paper presents a daily sediment yield simulation in the Upper Blue Nile under different Best Management Practices (BMPs) scenarios. The scenarios were baseline (existing condition), Buffer strips, stone bund (parallel terrace), and reforestation. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to model soil erosion, identify soil erosion prone areas and {{assess the impact of}} BMPs on sediment reduction. The study found satisfactory agreement between daily observed and simulated sediment concentration with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0. 88, percent bias (PBIAS) =&minus; 0. 05 %, and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR) = 0. 35 for calibration and NSE= 0. 83, RSR= 0. 61 and PBIAS=&minus; 11 % for validation. The sediment yield for baseline scenario was 117 &times; 10 6 t yr&minus; 1 . The <b>buffer-strips,</b> stone-bund and reforestation reduced the sediment yield at outlet of the Upper Blue Nile basin by 44 %, 41 % and 11 %, respectively. The sediment reduction at subbasins outlets varied from 29 % to 68 % by buffer strip, 9 % to 69 % by stone-bund and 46 % to 77 % by reforestation. This study clearly demonstrates the efficacy of catchment management intervention (BMPs) for sustainable water resources development in the Eastern Nile basin...|$|R
40|$|The {{switch from}} {{shifting}} cultivation to more permanent highland cropping systems in northern Thailand {{led to an}} increase in soil tillage intensity. In order to quantify soil losses by tillage erosion, a tillage experiment was set up and an on-farm survey was conducted. Soil fluxes due to manual tillage on five slopes (32 - 82 %) were measured by monitoring tracers, by measuring tillage step characteristics and by collecting soil material in a trench. The trench method yielded soil flux values that were significantly smaller than those obtained by the tracer or the step method. Soil fluxes resulting from one manual tillage pass ranged between 39 and 87 kg/m on the tested slopes. On slopes up to 60 %, {{there were no significant differences}} in soil fluxes. However, on slopes steeper than 70 %, soil fluxes increased significantly because the angle of repose for soil clods was exceeded. The soil fluxes are used to construct a nomogram for estimating soil loss rates resulting from manual tillage erosion as a function of slope and plot length. Rates on a typical upland field (slope 30 %- 50 %, slope length 30 - 50 m) range from 8 to 18 t/ha. tillage pass, so tilage erosion is a significant contributor to the total soil loss. It dominates on short fields and fields with <b>buffer-strips,</b> whereas water erosion is the more important form of soil loss on middle size and long fields. Increasing land pressure will result in increasing tillage erosion rates, and these need to be considered when assessing soil degradation rates or when studying hillslope evolution.
