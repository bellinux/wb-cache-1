5|$|Elf-like beings {{appear to}} have been a common {{characteristic}} within Indo-European mythologies. In the Celtic-speaking regions of north-west Europe, the beings most similar to elves are generally referred to with the Gaelic term Aos Sí. The equivalent term in modern Welsh is Tylwyth Teg. In the Romance-speaking world, beings comparable to elves are widely known by words derived from Latin fata ('fate'), which came into English as fairy. This word became partly synonymous with elf by the early modern period. Other names also abound, however, such as the Sicilian Donas de fuera ('ladies from outside'), or French bonnes dames ('good ladies'). In the Finnic-speaking world, the term usually thought most closely equivalent to elf is haltija (in Finnish) or haldaja (Estonian). Meanwhile, an example of an equivalent in the Slavic-speaking world is the vila (plural vile) of Serbo-Croatian (and, partly, Slovene) folklore. Elves <b>bear</b> <b>some</b> resemblances to the satyrs of Greek mythology, who were also regarded as woodland-dwelling mischief-makers.|$|E
5|$|On {{the grand}} {{strategic}} level Marlborough had a rare {{grasp of the}} broad issues involved, and was able {{from the start of}} the Spanish Succession war to see the conflict in its entirety. He was one of the few influences working towards genuine unity within the Grand Alliance, but the extension of the war aims to include the replacement of PhilipV as King of Spain was a fatal mistake. Marlborough stands accused – possibly for political and diplomatic reasons – of not pressing his private doubts about reinforcing failure. Spain proved a continuous drain of men and resources, and ultimately hampered his chances of complete success in Flanders, the war's main theatre. The Allies did come close to a complete victory on several occasions, but the increasingly severe conditions imposed upon LouisXIV forestalled an early end to hostilities. Although the Duke lost his political influence in the latter stages of the war he still possessed vast prestige abroad, yet his failure to communicate his innermost convictions to his allies or political masters means he must <b>bear</b> <b>some</b> responsibility for the continuance of the war beyond its logical conclusion.|$|E

All of these releases <b>bear</b> <b>some</b> functional or cosmetic influence from Copland.|$|E
25|$|Manillas <b>bear</b> <b>some</b> {{resemblance}} to torcs or torques in being rigid and circular and open-ended at the front. (The word 'torc' comes from Latin 'torquere', 'to twist', {{because of the}} twisted shape of the collar, an occasional feature of manillas.) Although torcs were most often neck-rings, there were also bracelets with this shape. Torcs were made from gold or bronze, less often silver.|$|E

Soubirous's visions took place against a cultural backdrop of apparitions and other supernatural events that <b>bear</b> <b>some</b> resemblance to Soubirous's experiences.

The regulations were also designed to lower the costs of building and repairing a car.|$|E
25|$|Many modern bridges, made {{of steel}} or {{reinforced}} concrete, often <b>bear</b> <b>some</b> of their load by tension within their structure. This reduces or eliminates the horizontal thrust against the abutments and allows their construction on weaker ground.

25|$|Although his {{majority}} {{was reduced}} to 625 in the 1951 general election, Hutchison was appointed as Financial Secretary and Under-Secretary of State to the War Office. With his post he was ex-officio Vice-Chairman of the Army Council and he occasionally deputised for the Secretary of State by attending Cabinet. Hutchison supported the controversial move to German rearmament in 1952, arguing that Germany should <b>bear</b> <b>some</b> {{of the burden of}} providing her own defence.|$|E
25|$|With {{the arrival}} of {{dedicated}} gunship helicopters such as the AH-1 Cobra (since 1967) and later the AH-64 Apache, armament subsystems for non-specific types would begin to drop off, with mostly defensive armament packages remaining. Such armament packages, giving decidedly heavy armament to small or primarily transport helicopters, have become popular among second and third world countries who lack the funds for dedicated attack helicopters. Most of those systems <b>bear</b> <b>some</b> resemblance to the plethora of US systems that follow in this entry.|$|E
