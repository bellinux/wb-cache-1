50|$|Submerging is done {{by opening}} the vents {{in the top of}} the ballast tanks, as well as opening the <b>valves</b> in the <b>bottom.</b> This allows water to flood into the tank, and allows the air already present inside the tank to escape through the top vents. as the air escapes from the tank, the vessel's {{buoyancy}} decreases, thus causing it to sink. In order for the submarine to surface, the vents {{in the top of the}} ballast tanks are shut, and compressed air is allowed into the tanks. The high-pressure air pocket pushes the water out through the <b>bottom</b> <b>valves</b> and increases the vessel's buoyancy, causing it to rise.

However, the limitations of conventional design architectures have made MRAM difficult to realize. In this work, a new annular currentperpendicular-to-plane (CPP) giant magnetoresistive (GMR) design architecture is presented to achieve robust single-step switching, reasonably low switching currents, and good thermal stability.

The basis for consideration of exigent circumstances relates to the impact that a delay in performing the associated activity (i. e., the heavy load movement) would have on upcoming Refueling Outage 9, scheduled to begin March 4, 2000.

50|$|Bottom {{blowdown}} piping drains {{the lowest}} {{parts of the}} boiler {{so it can be}} used to drain the boiler for servicing. Bottom blowdown piping must be of a diameter large enough to minimize the risk of being plugged with baked sludge. Modern boilers discharge bottom blowdown to a blowoff tank where the blowdown can flash and vent steam upwards without entraining water which might cause burns. A pipe near the bottom of the blowoff tank maintains a water level below the blowdown entry point and allows cooler water remaining from earlier blowdown events to drain from the tank first. Two <b>bottom</b> blowdown <b>valves</b> are often used in series to minimize erosion. One valve serves as the sealing valve, and the other as the blowdown valve. The sealing valve is customarily opened first and closed last. Both are opened rapidly and fully to minimize erosion on the seat and disk faces. Care is taken to avoid trapping scale or rust particles within the valve by reopening a valve to flush the particles through if resistance is encountered when attempting to close it. <b>Bottom</b> blowdown <b>valves</b> are often rebuilt or replaced whenever the boiler is taken out of service for maintenance.|$|R

30|$|The test {{facility}} consisted of mixer-viscometer, a gas addition system, a cooling system, a liquid charge system, cleaning solvent charge systems, and a data acquisition system. The gas charging system {{consisted of a}} pressurized gas bottle (usually 1800 psi), a pressure regulator, gas cooling bath and a mass flow meter. Operating pressure was preset using the pressure regulator. The gas through the preset pressure regulator was routed through an ice bath to cool it before it was metered. A Porter series 200 mass flowmeter was used to meter the flow rate and total volume of gas added to the vessel. The liquid charging system consisted of a simple funnel through which liquids {{were added to the}} vessel. The liquid charge could also be done using the cleaning system especially if it was desired to add liquid when the vessel was already pressurized. The cleaning and venting system consisted of a pump, <b>bottom</b> <b>valve,</b> drain trough and a vent. The pump could be used to draw liquid from the selected tank and send it to the vessel. The liquid could be a reactant or just cleaning solvent. The <b>bottom</b> <b>valve</b> was used to let in liquids into the vessel or drain from it. The drain trough was used to collect wastes after the experiments. The cooling system consisted of a chiller, the gas temperature control bath and a cooling jacket. The chiller was used to heat, cool or maintain temperature of the vessel contents. The gas temperature bath was intended to pre-cool the gas on hot days when the ambient temperatures were extremely high. The cooling jacket was the main heat exchange point between the chiller and the vessel contents. The shaft magnetic coupling was cooled to prevent heating due to friction. The mixing system consisted of a motor drive, torque sensor, and impeller. The vessel was 3.25 â³ internal diameter, 10 â³ height and rated for a maximum working pressure of 3000 psi. It was equipped with gas inlet and outlet valves, a sampling/drain valve at the bottom, pressure gage, safety/relief valve, and internal thermocouple. A Â¼ HP variable speed motor was used to rotate the mixing shaft from 0 to 1900 Â rpm. A rotary shaft non-contact torque sensor model 01424 was used to measure torque directly from the shaft. A helical-blade impeller with two Â¼ pitch blades was used for mixing vessel contents. The helical blades impeller was found to be more sensitive to viscosity change and hydrate formation during the trial tests. It also reduces the formation of a vortex during mixing. The process control and data acquisition system was developed using Factory Talk integrated suite software from Rockwell Automation. The recorded variables were shaft rotational speed, torque on shaft, chiller temperature, gas bath temperature, vessel temperature, vessel pressure, gas injection rate and totalized gas volume. A detailed description of the design, mathematical models, and calibration for this mixer-viscometer is published elsewhere (Bbosa 2015; Bbosa et al. 2017) Fig.Â  8 shows the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) for the setup.

Hanford Site tank farms consist of 28 double-shell and 149 single-shell underground storage tanks. The single shell tanks are out-of-service an no longer receive liquid waste. Core samples of salt cake and sludge waste are remotely obtained using truck-mounted, core drill platforms. Samples are recovered from tanks through a 2. 25 inch (in.) drill pipe in 26 -in. steel tubes, 1. 5 in. diameter. Drilling parameters vary with different waste types. Because sample recovery has been marginal an inadequate at times, a system was needed to provide drill truck operators with ``real-time feedback`` about the physical condition of the sample and the percent recovery, prior to making nuclear assay measurements and characterizations at the analytical laboratory. The Westinghouse Hanford Company conducted proof-of-principal radiographic testing to verify the feasibility of a proposed imaging system. Tests were conducted using an iridium 192 radiography source {{to determine the effects}} of high radiation on image quality. The tests concluded that samplers with a dose rate in excess of 5000 R/hr could be imaged with only a slight loss of image quality and samples less than 1000 R/hr have virtually no effect on image quality.
