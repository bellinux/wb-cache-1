5|$|A {{landslide}} and 36 major aftershocks of {{more than}} magnitude2.5 (in total, 400 aftershocks) followed the earthquake. A former Portuguese fortress, built by Admiral Afonso de Albuquerque in 1507, sustained heavy damage to its eastern wall <b>but</b> <b>otherwise</b> remained intact.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, Highway401 was widened to six lanes in Durham, <b>but</b> <b>otherwise</b> {{saw little}} improvement. The 1980s saw more {{sections}} widened, {{as well as}} a new collector-express system between Highway403 / 410 and Highway427 completed in mid-1985.|$|E

5|$|Portland—after helping sink Akatsuki—was {{hit by a}} torpedo from Inazuma or Ikazuchi, causing heavy {{damage to}} her stern and forcing her to steer in a circle.

5|$|The {{bridge was}} widened and {{slightly}} flattened in 1937–40, <b>but</b> <b>otherwise</b> still conforms {{to its original}} design. The eighth Thames bridge {{to be built in}} what is now Greater London, it is today the oldest surviving Thames bridge in London.|$|E
5|$|A short section from Well Hall Road to Eltham Road {{had been}} {{completed}} by 1930, aside from a bridge underneath the Hither Green – Dartford railway, and the road had been built as far west as Burnt Ash Hill {{by the middle of}} the decade. Sir Charles Bressey's Highway Development Survey (also known as the Bressey Report), published in 1937, showed a -long South Circular that would have a new-build section near Wandsworth Bridge (then being rebuilt) <b>but</b> <b>otherwise</b> be a series of online improvements to existing roads.|$|E

5|$|All four ships {{spent the}} {{majority}} of their time in service with the main Italian fleet, alternating between active duty for training exercises and reserve status. In 1897, Goito was converted into a minelayer and Montebello became a training ship for engine room personnel. Monzambano and Confienza were simply sold for scrap in 1901. Goito laid defensive minefields after Italy entered World War I in 1915, <b>but</b> <b>otherwise</b> did not see action during the war. The two surviving vessels remained in the Italian fleet until 1920, when they too were broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|All {{those lines}} are labeled as N3 and N2 optical centers and {{associated}} with a defect consisting of three nitrogen atoms bordering a vacancy. Other stones show additional bands: brown, green, or yellow diamonds show a band in the green at 504nm (H3 center, see above), sometimes accompanied by two additional weak bands at 537nm and 495nm (H4 center, a large complex presumably involving 4 substitutional nitrogen atoms and 2 lattice vacancies). Type IIb diamonds may absorb in the far red due to the substitutional boron, <b>but</b> <b>otherwise</b> show no observable visible absorption spectrum.|$|E
5|$|As {{an example}} of Curcubita, raw summer squash is 94% water, 3% carbohydrates, and 1% protein, with {{negligible}} fat content (table). In 100 grams, raw squash supplies 16 calories and is rich in vitamin C (20% of the Daily Value, DV), moderate in vitamin B6 and riboflavin (12–17% DV), <b>but</b> <b>otherwise</b> devoid of appreciable nutrient content (table), although the nutrient content of different Curcubita species may vary somewhat.|$|E

5|$|Both vessels saw action {{during the}} Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, where Lüft-ü Celil was sunk by a Russian {{artillery}} battery on the Danube. Hifz-ur Rahman engaged Russian minelayers {{at the mouth}} of the Danube <b>but</b> <b>otherwise</b> saw little action. She survived the war and was laid up for the following twenty years. She was mobilized at the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, but like the rest of the Ottoman fleet, was in poor condition. The ship was eventually sold in 1909 and broken up.|$|E
5|$|Charlton's major {{acquisition}} for the 1979–80 {{campaign was}} signing Yugoslavia international midfielder Ante Miročević for a £200,0000 fee from FK Budućnost Podgorica. Miročević proved unable {{to handle the}} British winter <b>but</b> <b>otherwise</b> added flair to the team in fairer weather. Wednesday went on to secure promotion with a third-place finish and Curran finished as the division's top-scorer.|$|E
5|$|Hypogeomys australis is an extinct rodent {{from central}} and southeastern Madagascar. First {{described}} in 1903, it {{is larger than}} its close relative, the living Hypogeomys antimena, which occurs further west, <b>but</b> <b>otherwise</b> similar. Average length of the femur (upper leg bone) is 72.1mm, compared to 63.8mm in H.antimena. One of the few extinct rodents of Madagascar, it survived to at least around 1536 BP based on radiocarbon dating. Little is known of its ecology, but it may have lived in burrows like its living relative and eaten some arid-adapted plants.|$|E

5|$|In 18th century France, {{there was}} a {{national}} weight standard, the marc de Paris of 8 ounces. The civil pound of 16 ounces was equivalent to 2 marks, {{and it was also}} used as the apothecaries' pound. With 30.6g, the ounces were considerably heavier than other apothecaries' ounces in Romance countries, <b>but</b> <b>otherwise</b> the French system was not remarkable. Its history and connections to the English and Flemish standards are discussed below under Weight standards named after Troyes.|$|E
5|$|In five matches for his {{new team}} during the 1994–95, he took 24 wickets at 14.58 {{including}} a haul of 5/28 against Vidarbha. He was rewarded with selection in the Under-19 Central Zone team for the zonal one-day tournament, taking five wickets at 25.00 in four matches. He had little success with the bat, scoring 47 on one occasion during the season, <b>but</b> <b>otherwise</b> only aggregating nine runs in six innings.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{when the first}} fortification at Longtown was built. The first defences may have been built during either the Iron Age or Roman, or Anglo-Saxon periods, but this remains uncertain. If Roman defences were constructed at the site, it was probably because of a Roman road that may have run nearby, and the defences may well have then been reused {{in the building of}} the current castle, parts of whose earthworks have square, angular corners, similar to those of Roman forts <b>but</b> <b>otherwise</b> unusual in 12th century English castles.|$|E
