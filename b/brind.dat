In recent years, {{the concept}} of food quality has {{received}} a lot of attention from food producers and retailers as well as from public authorities and health educators. There are a lot of discusses a practical approach to defining the term ‘quality’. But although there have been many attempts to clarify and define the concept, there still no general agreement on the term (Grebitus et al, 2006). For European food industry, quality is a key factor because the high quality of a product is the basis for success in this highly competitive market. However, it is difficult to decide which sort of meat has the best nutrition value or technological properties (Kortz, 2003). Work object. To set the sows influence on meat quality of offspring. Work methodics. Meat quality indexes were measured at ‘Meat characteristics and quality assessment laboratory’ after 48 hours afterslaughtering. Samples were held in refrigerator in + 4 oC temperature. During the test it was researched: the cooking losses were determined by boiling the meat in the circulating water bath for 30 min. The changes of weight of the meat sample were determined by weighing the meat samples before and after boiling. The meat mildness was determined according to the Warner-Bratzler method. The meat abondance of water was determined as the diminuation of the sample weight during 24 h holding the sample hung in a special bag with the net air temperature + 40 C. The water binding capacity was determined according to the Grau and Hamm method. The ash was determined by burning the organic matter of meat at temperature 600 to 8000 C. The colour was determined according to the CIE-LAB method by measuring meat lightness (L*), colour intensity (b*) and colour tone (a*). The quantity of dry matters as determined by drying the samples to the constant mass and weighing with the automatic scales for dry matters. Meat pH was measured with pH. The quantity of fat was determined according to the Sosclet method. Results. The sows had the biggest influence on meat color, water <b>brinding,</b> cooking losses and toughness (P < 0. 001), less influence was on meat Ph.

500|$|Brind's {{paper was}} criticized in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute for {{ignoring}} {{the role of}} response bias and for a [...] "blurring of association with causation." [...] The amount of attention the study received prompted a cautionary editorial by a JECH editor. With the appearance of larger studies contradicting Brind's finding, <b>Brind</b> failed to convince the scientific community that abortion caused breast cancer. In 2003, <b>Brind</b> was invited to the NCI workshop on abortion and breast cancer, {{where he was the}} only one to formally dissent from the workshop's finding that there is no link between the two. <b>Brind</b> blames the lack of support for his findings on a conspiracy, arguing that the NCI and other major medical organizations are engaged in a [...] "cover-up" [...] for the purpose of [...] "protecting the abortion industry".|$|E

500|$|The surface {{bombardment}} {{took place}} during the late morning of 15 June. The bombardment force was organised into three task units comprising both cruisers and destroyers; Achilles and Uganda (with <b>Brind</b> embarked) operated with Tenacious, Newfoundland was accompanied by Troubridge and Swiftsure by Teazer. This left the aircraft carriers with only two destroyers for protection. Each task unit was also assigned two Seafires to spot their gunfire. The destroyers which were assigned to the bombardment task units were responsible for counter-battery fire on any Japanese guns which fired on the cruiser, and for generating smoke screens if necessary. Throughout the bombardments the carriers sailed [...] to the east of Truk, and maintained a combat air patrol over the area.|$|E

500|$|The English courts {{initially}} wavered {{in recognizing}} {{that an individual}} has a legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit arising from a representation from the authorities. The notion of protecting a substantive legitimate expectation was espoused in the 1995 High Court decision in R. v.

In that controversial case, Justice Stephen Sedley formulated the framework for legitimate expectations as {{the balance of the}} requirements of fairness against the decision-maker's reasons to change the policy.

2500|$|Clinton {{learned to}} play cello and piano, and his {{considerable}} musical talent became evident ahead of Hubert's. Yet despite their father's active interest in music, such activity {{was seen as a}} pastime, and was frowned upon as a career as being too uncertain and, unlike painting, a less than professional pursuit unseemly for a gentleman. From January 1856 to the middle of 1858 Hubert attended a preparatory school in Malvern, from where he moved to Twyford Preparatory School in Hampshire. At Twyford his interest in music was encouraged by the headmaster, and by two organists, S S Wesley at Winchester Cathedral, and Edward <b>Brind,</b> at Highnam church. From Wesley he gained an enduring love of Bach's music, which according to The Times [...] "ultimately found expression in his most important literary work, Johann Sebastian Bach, the Story of the Development of a Great Composer (1909)". <b>Brind</b> gave Parry piano and basic harmony lessons, and took him to the Three Choirs Festival in Hereford in 1861. Among the choral works performed at that festival were Mendelssohn's Elijah, Mozart's Requiem, and Handel's Samson and Messiah. Orchestral works included Beethoven's Pastoral and Mendelssohn's Italian symphonies. The experience left a great impression on Parry, and effectively marked the beginning of his lifelong association with the festival.|$|E

2500|$|An {{instance}} of {{the application of the}} anxious scrutiny level of review is the 1995 case of R. v.

In ex parte Smith, Smith and three other individuals appealed a Ministry of Defence ruling that mandated the discharge of homosexuals from the service. The court accepted that [...] "he more substantial the interference with human rights, the more the court will require by way of justification before it is satisfied that the decision is reasonable". This is as long as the decision remains within the range of responses open to a reasonable decision-maker.|$|E
2500|$|The {{justification}} for the strict standard of this {{ground of judicial review}} is the doctrine of separation of powers. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte <b>Brind</b> (1991), Lord Ackner explained that where the court was not acting in pursuance of a statutory right of appeal but exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, it would be usurping the decision-maker's power if it substituted its own decision on the merits for that of the decision-maker. It could quash a decision by a government minister [...] "f no reasonable minister properly directing himself would have reached the impugned decision", but for an aggrieved person [...] "o seek the court's intervention on the basis that the correct or objectively reasonable decision is other than the decision which the minister has made is to invite the court to adjudicate as if Parliament had provided a right of appeal against the decision – that is, to invite an abuse of power by the judiciary".|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1934, the League of Nations Council {{determined}} that peacekeeping force would be necessary during the plebiscite period. The German and French governments agreed to allow an international force to enter the Saar. On 8 December 1934, the council unanimously approved a resolution calling for such a force. Britain (1500 troops), Italy (1300), Sweden (260) and the Netherlands (250) agreed to provide troops for the 3300-strong [...] "International Force in the Saar". All expenses above and beyond those normally incurred for the same troops, were charged to the League fund {{set aside for the}} plebiscite. This may be [...] "the first true example of an international peace observation force". The League appointed a commander, General John <b>Brind,</b> with operational control of the entire force. Troops patrolled, but did not police, the Saar. They were not to respond except to emergencies and at the request of local authorities. There was little or no violence during the plebiscite and the peacekeeping effort was regarded as a success.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the wounded}} was a child whose {{injuries}} had been so severe that a rescue worker at the scene assumed the child had been killed. One young woman lost both legs; she was photographed by Derek <b>Brind</b> of the Associated Press as a British Paratrooper held her in his arms. Passerby Frank Heagan witnessed the explosion and came upon {{what was left of}} two binmen who had been [...] "blown to pieces". He added that [...] "there was blood everywhere and people moaning and screaming. The street was full of girls and women all wandering around". The injured could be heard screaming as the ambulances transported them to hospital; emergency amputations were performed at the scene. One policeman angrily denounced the attack by stating: [...] "This was a deliberate attempt to kill innocent people. The people who planted it must have known that people were being evacuated into its path". Whilst the security forces and firemen pulled victims from the debris in Donegall Street, two more bombs went off elsewhere in the city centre; however, nobody was hurt in either attack. That same day in Derry, a British soldier, John Taylor, was shot dead by an IRA sniper. In Dublin, the IRA's Chief of Staff, Seán Mac Stíofáin, suffered burns to his face and hands after he had opened a letter bomb sent to him through the post.
