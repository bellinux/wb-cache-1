5|$|An {{appeal for}} holiday {{pictures}} and postcards of Europe announced on the BBC produced over ten million items, {{some of which}} proved useful. Information collected by the French resistance helped provide details on Axis troop movements and on construction techniques used by the Germans for <b>bunkers</b> <b>and</b> other defensive installations.|$|E

5|$|Citizens {{were trained}} {{from the age}} of 12 to station {{themselves}} in the nearest bunker to repel invaders. Local Party cells organised families to clean and maintain their local <b>bunkers,</b> <b>and</b> civil defence drills were held at least twice a month, lasting for up to three days, in which civilians of military age of both sexes were issued with rifles (but no ammunition).|$|E

5|$|Aside from a brief {{break in}} firing 23 September to take aboard wounded from the , damaged by gunfire, New Jersey was heavily engaged in bombarding the Kansong area, {{supporting}} {{the movement of}} the U.S. X Corps. The pattern again was harassing fire by night, destruction of known targets by day. Enemy movement was restricted by the fire of her big guns. A bridge, a dam, several gun emplacements, mortar positions, pillboxes, <b>bunkers,</b> <b>and</b> two ammunition dumps were demolished.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October New Jersey steamed {{south to}} engage Communist targets. During the {{shelling}} aircraft spotting for the battleship reported taking heavy anti-aircraft {{fire to the}} extreme north of the target zone; subsequently, New Jersey altered her fire to silence the site with her big guns. The next day New Jersey leveled 30structures, destroyed three underground <b>bunkers,</b> <b>and</b> shelled a Viet Cong trench line. That afternoon an aerial observer located an enemy artillery position on a hilltop southwest of Cap Lay. New Jersey responded by firing six 16inch rounds at the site, destroying it. Follow up assaults on 30 October destroyed a Communist resupply area and an anti-aircraft site.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 1940, the Yugoslav Supreme Command {{had issued}} {{orders to the}} 4th Army District {{headquarters}} to make all necessary preparations for defence and demolitions and ordered a 14-day exercise for border troops. 4th Army District headquarters submitted a progress report on this work on 30 January 1941. This report indicated that along the Hungarian border, <b>bunkers</b> <b>and</b> trenches had been constructed for the immediate defence of the Drava along the Yugoslav-Hungarian border, in particular at Varaždin, Koprivnica, Virovitica and Slatina, but no obstacles such as barbed wire entanglements or anti-tank ditches had been developed.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Wonsan {{at the end}} of January, Wisconsin bombarded enemy guns at Hodo Pando {{before she}} was rearmed at Sasebo. The {{battleship}} rejoined TF 77 on 2 February, and the next day blasted railway buildings and marshaling yards at Hodo Pando and Kojo before rejoining TF 77. After replenishment at Yokosuka a few days later, she returned to the Kosong area and resumed gunfire support. During that time, she destroyed railway bridges and a small shipyard while conducting call-fire missions on enemy command posts, <b>bunkers,</b> <b>and</b> personnel shelters, making numerous cuts on enemy trench lines in the process.|$|E
5|$|The Allied Expeditionary Air Force {{undertook}} over 3,200 photo-reconnaissance sorties from April 1944 {{until the}} start of the invasion. Photos of the coastline were taken at extremely low altitude to show the invaders the terrain, obstacles on the beach, and defensive structures such as <b>bunkers</b> <b>and</b> gun emplacements. To avoid alerting the Germans as to the location of the invasion, this work had to be undertaken over the entire European coastline. Inland terrain, bridges, troop emplacements, and buildings were also photographed, in many cases from several angles, to give the Allies as much information as possible. Members of Combined Operations Pilotage Parties clandestinely prepared detailed harbour maps, including depth soundings.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{was called}} to support the {{multinational}} response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. The brigade grew to a 7,700 soldier force composed of three groups, ten battalions, four separate companies, and eight detachments in support of XVIII Airborne Corps during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The brigade completed 1,500 combat heavy battalions equivalent days of work constructing roads, airfields, heliports, ammunition/fuel/water storage points, life support areas and forward landing strips, distributed over ten million maps, trained over 5,000 coalition engineers, and supported the French attack on Assalman airfield. During follow-on missions the brigade destroyed over 6,000 enemy <b>bunkers</b> <b>and</b> one million tons of munitions.|$|E

5|$|The work of {{the guards}} {{involved}} carrying out repair work on the defences, monitoring the zone from watchtowers and <b>bunkers</b> <b>and</b> patrolling the line several times a day. Border Reconnaissance (Grenzaufklärungszug or GAK) soldiers, an elite reconnaissance force, carried out patrols and intelligence-gathering {{on the western side}} of the fence. Western visitors to the border were routinely photographed by the GAKs, who also oversaw work detachments maintaining the fence. The workers would be covered by machine guns to discourage them from attempting to escape.|$|E
5|$|Two major {{religious}} {{sites in}} Mendip at Glastonbury Abbey and Wells Cathedral and their precincts and dispersed residences, tithe barns and The Abbot's Fish House also figure {{prominently in the}} list. Prehistoric defensive features such as Ponter's Ball Dyke were supplemented in the medieval period by motte-and-bailey castles such as Farleigh Hungerford, Nunney and Fenny Castle. Commercial and industrial development {{is represented by the}} Old Iron Works at Mells and various market crosses. The most recent monuments are World War II <b>bunkers</b> <b>and</b> bombing decoys on Black Down the highest point of the Mendip Hills, which also appear on the Sedgemoor list as the site crosses the boundary between the districts.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the Marine Corps {{determined}} that the 37mm gun of the M2s and M3s was not powerful enough to defeat Japanese <b>bunkers,</b> <b>and</b> so they would be replaced with tanks armed with 75mm guns. Following {{the end of the}} Guadalcanal campaign, A Company returned to Australia, where the M2A4s were replaced with the new M4 Shermans in preparation for the Battle of Cape Gloucester in December 1943. They remained in service in some areas of the Pacific Theater until 1943. After they served in the Pacific, they were used for training.|$|E

5|$|Although three launch battalions {{were formed}} by the Germans in late 1943, they never {{got the chance to}} deploy to the V-weapons launch sites at Watten and Wizernes. On 3 July 1944, the Oberkommando West {{authorised}} the cessation of construction at the heavily damaged sites. On 18 July 1944, Hitler abandoned plans for launching V-2s from <b>bunkers</b> <b>and</b> authorized the downgrading of the Wizernes bunker to make it a LOX production facility. However, these plans were overtaken by the Allied liberation of Northern France following the Normandy landings. The site was finally abandoned {{a few days before the}} Allies reached it at the start of September during the rapid liberation of the area by British, American, Canadian and Polish troops. British engineers inspected it on 5 September.|$|E
5|$|As the American and South Korean forces {{approached}} the Chinese defenses, they {{were met with}} grenades, Bangalore torpedoes, shaped charges and rocks. Unable to safely advance, American and South Korean troops were forced to rely on close-support artillery to subdue Chinese resistance, but a complex network of <b>bunkers</b> <b>and</b> tunnels allowed the Chinese to bring up reinforcements as the above-ground troops were depleted. Although the 31st Infantry Regiment was equipped with ballistic vests in the first mass military deployment of modern personal armor; its 1st and 3rd battalions nevertheless suffered 96 fatalities, with an additional 337 men wounded in the first attack – the heaviest casualties the 31st Infantry Regiment had suffered {{in a single day}} during the war.|$|E
5|$|As the French {{constructed}} further fortifications, Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance aircraft}} {{picked up the}} activity and reported it. The steep slopes {{on the banks of}} the Meuse, added to what appeared in photographic reconnaissance to be a formidable barrier of <b>bunkers</b> <b>and</b> defence lines, caused Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander in chief of Army Group A, to question the wisdom of Guderian in choosing Sedan as the point of maximum effort. To identify how strong these fortifications were, a team of photographic specialists were called in to evaluate the pictures. Their analysis concluded that what appeared to be strong fortified positions were just the construction sites of half-built bunkers that were, to all intents and purposes, empty shells. The contribution of the specialists tilted the Sedan attack plan into Guderian's favour.|$|E

5|$|Between 2 and 8 December New Jersey {{returned}} {{to aid the}} 3rd Marine Division, shelling Viet Cong bunker complexes for the Marines operating around the Da Nang area before departing for Singapore 9 December. On 26 December New Jersey {{returned to}} the gunline, taking up station off Tuy Hòa {{in support of the}} Army of the Republic of Vietnam 47th Division. For the next three days New Jersey fired her guns to support the II Corps, in the process destroying Viet Cong <b>bunkers</b> <b>and</b> supply depots and neutralizing enemy cave posts. New Jersey would remain in the waters of the DMZ until after New Years, shelling Communist bunkers for ground troops until leaving to support the 1st Marine Division 3 January.|$|E
5|$|By mid-afternoon, D Company {{had finally}} moved into {{position}} and commenced an assault, {{pushing through the}} bunker system from the north-east with the Centurion tanks in close support crushing many <b>bunkers</b> <b>and</b> their occupants with their tracks. The progress of the Australian assault was slowed by thick vegetation {{and the size of}} the position, even as the resistance slackened and volume of fire diminished. Indeed, the bunker system was later found to cover nearly a square kilometre and was wider than the front of the assaulting company. Painstakingly the Australians searched each bunker systematically. With the action now over, D Company and the tanks subsequently linked up with B Company and established a night defensive position.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944, his {{regiment}} {{was withdrawn}} from the front and converted into the 395th Guards Heavy Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment. It was also reequipped with the updated ISU-152 self-propelled gun, one of which Snetkov became commander of. Snetkov and his regiment {{did not return to}} the front until June 1944, where they became part of the 3rd Belorussian Front. He was promoted to lieutenant around this time, and from late June, he fought in Operation Bagration, the Soviet strategic offensive that recaptured Belarus and eastern Poland. Between 22 and 27 June, during fighting in the Bogushevsk area, Snetkov's crew was reported by a superior to have destroyed a self-propelled gun, two <b>bunkers,</b> <b>and</b> two anti-tank guns. For this he received a second Order of the Red Star on 10 July. The regiment, as part of the front, fought in the Baltic Offensive and the Gumbinnen Operation during the fall.|$|E
