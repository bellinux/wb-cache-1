25|$|Bache was {{awaiting}} <b>boiler</b> <b>work</b> {{the summer}} of 1884 with her party assisting in work {{in the vicinity of}} New York with a change of command from Lieutenant H. R. Mansfield, USN, to Lieutenant E. D. F. Heald, USN, Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey and former commander of the schooner Eagre, who then took the ship to survey the coasts of Alabama, Louisiana and the west coast of Florida. The routine of surveys in the north during summer, a yard period and then a winter season in southern waters, ranging to Texas, continued until an accident with the Bache's boilers in the vicinity of Nantucket Shoals required she be towed by the Blake to New York for major repairs, taking her out of service for a month.|$|E
25|$|While {{the engine}} was being {{prepared}} for Christmas trains {{at the end of}} the 1999 tourist season, 2860 was found to have serious leaks from the superheater elements. The superheaters and the arch tubes were known to be life expired and some other fairly major <b>boiler</b> <b>work</b> was required. A variety of factors prevented BC Rail from carrying out the repairs immediately, including the fact that CPR Hudson 2816 was in the BCR shop being rebuilt under contract, and that all BC Rail passenger services were under threat in the lead up to the eventual privatization of BC Rail. After the election of the BC Liberal Government in 2001 all passenger services were gradually phased out starting with the Royal Hudson excursion. The Royal Hudson excursion used other locomotives during the 2000 and 2001 seasons such as back up locomotive 3716 (an ex-Canadian Pacific 2-8-0 which is also Provincially owned and currently operates on the Kettle Valley Steam Railway in Summerland).|$|E

2500|$|Since 819 {{was built}} during World War II, some {{materials}} were in short supply. The Cotton Belt emblems, {{which would have}} normally been made of brass, were made of steel to save brass for the war effort. Decorative emblems, numbers, etc., were also made of steel and chromium plating was entirely eliminated. Work on the new L1 Northerns began on Tuesday June 2, 1942. But delivery of the boilers from the Baldwin Locomotive Works lagged. The five new boilers were shipped by Baldwin to Pine Bluff between November 5 and December 12, 1942. The rail journey from Philadelphia to Pine Bluff took about five days for each <b>boiler.</b> <b>Work</b> by the Cotton Belt shop forces took an additional five or six weeks to complete each new locomotive.|$|E
2500|$|This unique 0-6-0T {{locomotive}} {{dates from}} 1885 {{and is the}} only engine on the line to have been built by Dübs and Company, of Glasgow; purchased to tackle the steep gradients of the Foxdale Railway she was ideally suited to the job. [...] After the merger in 1905 she was numbered 15 in the Isle of Man Railway fleet (having previously been Manx Northern's No. 4) and only saw sporadic use, most notably on Ramsey Cattle Mart specials and for snow clearing trains. [...] She was reboiler in 1923, receiving the first boiler on the IMR to carry [...] "Ross" [...] pop safety valves. [...] When the Marquess of Ailsa took over operations in 1967 she was repainted into spring green livery and saw service once again until 1968. By 1975 she had been painted into Manx Northern colours and placed in the then new museum at Port Erin where she remained until 1993 when she was returned to Douglas by road for steam feasibility tests. [...] By 1995 she was the star of the show, operating on the 1 in 12 gradients of the Snaefell Mountain Railway as part of the centenary celebrations. [...] This had historical precedent as Caledonia had been leased for construction purposes in 1895. [...] She has since been part of the stable of serviceable locomotives, having been painted into a non-prototypical blue livery in 1999 but reverted to the intricate original paint scheme in 2007. [...] The locomotive {{was the subject of a}} major rebuild from 2009 and returned to service in January 2013. [...] She was last in service in 2014 and is currently stripped down undergoing <b>boiler</b> <b>work,</b> unlikely to see service until 2016. The boiler was sent to the Severn Valley Railway in January 2016 to be repaired.|$|E
