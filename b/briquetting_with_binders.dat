In this work, a low-volatility bituminous coal from the Changcun mine and bentonite binders are used for briquetting. The compressive strength, impact strength, and thermal stability of briquettes made using different binder concentration are determined. The morphology and distribution of binders in briquettes are studied by optical microscopy and digital image-processing technologies. The concept of roundness is introduced to indicate the pressure to which the binders are subjected during briquetting. The influences of binder morphology on briquette strength are discussed. The binders are mainly in aggregated and dispersed forms, present in similar proportions in the <b>briquettes.</b> Aggregated <b>binders</b> <b>with</b> large differences in size are not well-distributed. Binder roundness values are concentrated between 1.5 and 4.0, which indicates that most aggregated binders are compressed and conform well to the surfaces of coal particles. A few binders had roundness value approximating 1 or above 4, which indicated that these were under little pressure or overloaded, respectively. The relationships between briquette strength and binder morphology show that aggregated binders are detrimental to mechanical strength while dispersed binders benefit briquetting.|$|R

Saw dust was sieved through 2 mm screen mesh and 6 different samples were prepared with sieved saw dust and each binding agents as 5 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, and 50 % dry basis. Cow dung samples were shown difficulties of mould detaching.

Densities of <b>briquettes</b> <b>with</b> 30 % <b>binder</b> of wheat flour and paper pulp were 373. 7 kg/m 3 and 289. 8 kg/m 3 respectively. Compression behavior of <b>briquettes</b> <b>with</b> 30 % (dry basis) binding agents was examined for cyclic loading applied using the hydraulic jack. Maximum load of 110 kg (35. 9 kg/cm 2 pressure) was maintained for all the experiments.

Natural drying time was evaluated at 86 ~ 89 % relative humidity and 25 ~ 30 oC ambient temperature, It was recorded that briquettes came to 25 % moisture content (Wet basis) within 33 hours and 20 % moisture content (Wet basis) within 35 hours.

40|$|Significant {{ecological}} {{concerns and}} attractive financial opportunities are raised by growing deposits of waste coal fines in the United States. Roughly 2 {{billion tons of}} waste coal fines are stored in impoundments in the United States and approximately 50 million additional tons are generated annually. These fines can be utilized by extrusion or roller press <b>briquetting</b> along <b>with</b> a <b>binder</b> to impart mechanical strength and water resistance to the briquettes. In this study, a variety of binder materials were considered and were evaluated on seven criteria: cost, availability, binding ability, processability, water resistance, heating value, and toxicity/environmental impact. Municipal solid waste (MSW) plastic binders are the primary focus in this study due to their excellent performance in all areas. The goal {{of this study was}} to characterize a briquetted coal product, using waste plastics, which may be an economically and ecologically viable substitute for conventional stoker coal. High density polyethylene (HDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) provide water resistance to the coal briquettes, and since they do not contain chlorine will not promote dioxin or furan formation when combusted. In addition, the heating value of LDPE is 46. 4 MJ/kg—over double that of the 21. 9 MJ/kg waste coal fines used in this study. A 10 wt% LDPE- 90 wt% coal mixture was found to have an 11 % higher heating value over the neat waste coal fines. A number of coal/LDPE mixtures were <b>briquetted</b> <b>with</b> varying coal particle size distributions, moisture content, and LDPE concentrations using a laboratory-scale roller press briquetter. To examine mechanical robustness, briquettes were subjected to compressive testing and tumbler testing according to ASTM D 441 - 07. Thermal analysis of the briquetted fuels using thermogravimetric analysis/simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC) in air revealed a significant interaction between coal and LDPE. Laboratory-scale combustion tests revealed a dependence of combustion efficiency on LDPE concentration in the briquetted fuel. Gas chromatography of effluent gas at 3 minutes validated this trend. The results of this work indicate that HDPE and LDPE can serve as excellent waste coal binders due to their high energy density, water resistance, binding ability, and relatively low cost. ...|$|R

Generally the down draft gasifier is being used in villages for power generation and rural electrification, where in different sizes of rural bio mass material being used. Even though the briquetting of saw dust and cow dung is best suitable for down draft gasifier the size of briquette plays vital role on its effectiveness in gasification process. This paper deals the performance analysis about the briquetting bio mass material, ie.
