One of the first concerts to be recorded on a Magnetophon was Mozart's 39th Symphony played by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham, during their 1936 concert tour. The recording was made on an AEG K2 Magnetophon running at 100 cm/s. The tape used was the early <b>black</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> Fe3O4 type. When Beecham and the musicians heard the playback they were greatly disappointed with the distortion and noise on the recording. This recording survived until the 1990s and has been transferred.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} solventborne paint systems applied on carbon steel and hot-dip galvanized steel {{in a wide range}} of atmospheric exposures. The study has involved paint systems exposure for 3. 5 years in eight natural atmospheres. The atmospheric conditions cover from temperate rural climates to tropical severe marine and Antarctic coastal regions. The paint systems included several alkyds formulated with a variety of pigments (anticorrosive and barrier), epoxies, chlorinated rubber, and zinc-rich (ethyl silicate and epoxy). It has been concluded that in rural and urban atmospheres alkyd systems afford equivalent anticorrosive protection of steel to the epoxy/polyurethane system. The toxic red lead pigment may be replaced in long linseed-oil alkyd primer paints by non-toxic pigments, such as a mixture of micaceous <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> (MIO) and <b>black</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> or zinc phosphate, without affecting the anticorrosive properties of the paint system.

50|$|Today, most potters are {{familiar}} with tenmoku glaze in a reduction firing. But to get oil spot effects, stiff tenmokus need to be fired in oxidation. This relies on a very simple chemical principle that, once understood, leads to successful firings. Red iron oxide (Fe2O3) acts as a refractory in oxidation but it can easily be changed to a flux {{in the form of}} <b>black</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (FeO), in reduction. Most potters {{are familiar}} with this property but for oil spots, we are interested in iron’s ability to self-reduce. At approximately cone 7 (2250 °F or 1232 °C), ferric iron (Fe2O3) cannot maintain its trigonal crystalline structure and rearranges to a cubic structure, magnetite (Fe3O4), which further reduces to become ferrous (FeO). This is called thermal reduction, and what this means in layman’s terms is that, when it is sufficiently heated, the red iron oxide used in the glaze recipe will naturally let go of an oxygen atom. As the liberated oxygen bubbles rise {{to the surface of the}} glaze, they drag a bit of the magnetite with them and deposit it on the surface. A rough black spot is left on the glaze surface that is a different color than the surrounding glaze, due to the larger concentration of iron oxide in that small area and its subsequent re-oxidization during cooling.|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the remanent magnetization of red sediments are first considered, followed by a brief account of present ideas {{on the origin of}} these rocks. Possible processes by which sediments in general might acquire a remanent magnetization are postulated, with reference to chemical and depositional remanent magnetization, and these hypotheses are then discussed both from a geological standpoint and in connection with the observed {{characteristics of}} the remanence. The experimental work done on the magnetic properties of red rocks is summarized, and this is followed by a discussion of all the available evidence on the origin of the remanent magnetization of red beds, with particular reference to whether it is of a chemical or depositional nature. The importance or otherwise of the red iron oxide in the rocks in contributing to the remanence is also discussed. From the evidence avail-able at the present time no general process of magnetization can be adduced for red sandstones, nor can the NRM be attributed to either the red or <b>black</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> present.

30|$|Dactylography, {{the study}} of {{fingerprints}} {{as a means of}} identification is one of the fundamental science in criminal investigations (Nithin et al. 2009). Most of the time, these fingermarks are invisible and require physical or chemical reagents for visualisation (Champod et al. 2004; Jelly et al. 2009). Choice of the technique used for fingermark development relies on factors such as surface porosity and smoothness, the age of fingermark, the composition of fingermark and the recovery conditions (Sears et al.; 2012; Dhall et al. 2016). Powdering technique is the most basic and common approach for fingermark development in the crime scene (Becue et al. 2011; Yamashita and French 2011). Powder particles adhere to the moist and oily component of the fingermark residue (Champod et al. 2004; Choi et al. 2008). The size, shape and agglomeration state of the powder particles play a large part in determining the amount of adhesion they have to the fingermark (Wilshire, 1996; Chadwick et al. 2012). Fine and rounded particulates adhere better than large, coarse ones. Hence, most powder formulations are composed of particles of size ranging between 1 and 10  μm (Wilshire, 1996; Sodhi and Kaur, 2001). Commercial black powder commonly contains <b>black</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide,</b> rosin, lamp black, fuller’s earth and manganese dioxide which acts as colourant as well as adhesive substance that increases adherence (Goode and Morris, 1983; Lee and Gaensslen, 2012).|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} color-matching any color product {{is a process}} that can be quite {{complicated}} and requires great skill from a color analyst. As the name suggests color-matching is the process in which the color of a standard is obtained from a sample through careful inspection and precision in order for the colors to match up. It {{is a process that}} can vary in length dependent of the amount of pigments used.  Foundations are a type of liquid emulsion cosmetic and consist of five main pigments; white (titanium dioxide), red, brown, yellow and <b>black</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxides.</b> These five pigments can when mixed together result in hundreds of shades. One of the greatest challenges for cosmetics companies is to successfully manufacture these shades often from a benchmark, a desired shade, as well as maintaining this same shade when the batch is scaled up from lab production to factory.  Oriflame is a direct-selling cosmetics company in which the Marketing department and Color Cosmetic department work closely in order to produce new products and shades for each catalogue. Liquid foundation shades are decided by the Marketing department and given to the Color Cosmetic department to color-match.  Currently the process of color-matching is carried out through the visual assessment by the color analyst. In order to improve the efficiency and lead - time of the current method, Oriflame has drawn inspiration from other sectors dealing with color and taken the decision to color-match {{with the use of a}} spectrophotometer coupled with color-appropriate software. The method was divided into four separate processes; confirming a sample method presentation to the spectrophotometer, colorant file set-up & process, color-matching process with the color-appropriate software and color match comparison.

These cosmetics routinely contain in their list of ingredients irritant factors such as tints, fragrances, preservatives or vehicle-agents. We present an in-detail overview of how these materials affect patients who display an allergic reaction after usage of cosmetic products that contain the substances mentioned above. Some of the cases discussed in this paper reference that of a 44 -year-old woman with a 10 -month history of periorbital and eyelid dermatitis (caused by <b>black</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide),</b> a study conducted on 4454 patients, by the North American Contact Dermatitis Group to evaluate the prevalence of allergic reactions triggered by paraben-containing mascaras, and 11 reports of eyelid ACD caused by shellac in mascaras or eyeliners.

Objectives: We sought to identify common allergens found in mascaras and to explore the extent each of these components affects patients that suffer from or are prone to developing eyelid ACD. Methods: We have performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis. Results: While parabens {{are one of the most}} widely avoided by consumers of cosmetic products, being considered a major allergy-inducing factor, fragrances appear to have a much more considerable adverse effect on individuals (~ 1 % of the general public in U.

40|$|Foundries today use {{temporary}} molds {{made from}} silica sand with a resin bonding agent {{to hold a}} form until the metal is poured. With the aid of computer simulations, the molds are designed to produce good castings with minimal pattern iterations by calculating cooling and porosity. Stress analysis simulations are being developed using the current software, but the known mechanical properties for the sand mold are minimal and incomplete. This study measures the elastic modulus of bonded sand {{as a function of}} temperature to obtain baseline data for the model. Following ASTM standards, a three point bend test is used to measure the elastic modulus of chemically bonded sand as a function of temperature to better understand the complex nature of the mold as it undergoes heating and cooling. Multiple measurements of the elastic modulus of PUNB bonded silica sand are performed from room temperature to 500 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere to capture the changes in the elastic modulus under heating. It is found that for an intermediate heating rate of 8 °C/min, the elastic modulus decreases steeply from a room temperature value of about 3, 600 MPa to 600 MPa at 125 °C. Between 125 °C and 250 °C, the elastic modulus is relatively constant. Above 250 °C, it increases to 1, 200 MPa at 280 °C and then decreases again to 800 MPa at 350 °C. Above 350 °C, the elastic modulus increases linearly with temperature until it reaches 2, 200 MPa at 500 °C. At approximately 500 °C, the strength of the bonded sand vanishes. At a given temperature above 125 °C, the elastic modulus can vary by more than a factor of two depending on the heating rate. Furthermore, the elastic modulus agrees with previous steady state temperature measurement literature when specimens are held at a constant temperature until the elastic modulus reach steady. It is also found that the addition of <b>black</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> has no effect on the elastic modulus, whereas solvent removal before a test increases the stiffness of the bonded sand at temperatures below 150 °C...|$|E
40|$|Gunshot residue (GSR) mixture {{consists}} of partially burned particles of propellant and characteristic particles of elements originating from the primer, bullet, propellant and some additives in the propellant. Since Harrison and Gillory [1] drew forensic scientists’ {{attention to the}} fact that GSR contained trace amounts of inorganic compounds such as lead, barium and antimony, a number of analytical techniques have been tested trying to find and establish sensitive, selective and reliable methods to identify and analyse gunshot residues. The standard procedure for the analysis of gunshot residues involves imaging these small metallic particles using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and subsequent compositional analysis using Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDX). This study focuses on the analysis organic compounds in GSR. It is motivated by the increasing need to overcome the problems with the analysis of lead-free ammunitions. A comprehensive literature review was performed in order to determine the most commonly encountered organic compounds in GSR. These compounds include diphenylamine, methylcentralite, ethylcentralite, nitroglycerine, 2 -nitrodiphenylamine and 4 -nitrodiphenylamine. It has been clearly demonstrated using standard materials and appropriate calibration curves that gas chromatograph and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is capable of providing limits of detection that are consistent with the concentrations of the key organic constituents found in gunshot residues. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the relative concentrations of seven key components can be used to provide branding information on the shotgun cartridges. A strong relationship was found between the chemical composition of fired and unfired powder. Therefore, it is possible to differentiate between two ammunition brands through the analysis of the organic constituents. Traditional fingerprint powders such as titanium dioxide, aluminium, carbon <b>black,</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide,</b> lycopodium spores and rosin are used to enhance fingerprint left at the scene of crime. More recently nanoparticles have been demonstrated to be highly effective for the enhancement of the fingerprints [2]. Silica nano-particulates of defined size and shape were synthesised and functionalised with two different functional groups (phenyl and long chain hydrocarbon) using a Tri- phasic Reverse Emulsion (TPRE) method. These nano-particulates were characterised using scan electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), elemental analysis, particles size analyser, BET surface area and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These powders were used as an effective agent to visualise latent fingerprints on different surfaces. Furthermore, they have been utilised to absorb any organic materials within the fingerprint from the discharged of weapon. Analyses of the adsorbed organic residues were performed using GC/MS and Raman spectroscopy. The results showed that the synthesised silica nano-particulate fingerprint powder gave better result in term of their ability to absorb organic materials in GSR and enhance the visualisation of the latent fingerprint compared to a single commercial powder...|$|E

Under optical microscopy, some samples of processed natural pigments do not exhibit optical activity, thus revealing mixtures with synthetic pigments, while natural pigments present a strong birefringence colorless due to optically active minerals.

30|$|The PEG-coated {{magnetite}} NPs were synthesized via the co-precipitation method [38, 39] {{with minor}} modifications. Briefly, 1.3  mg of FeCl 3.6 H 2 O and 0.5  mg of FeCl 2.4 H 2 O were dissolved in 20  mL of deionized water, and {{the solution was}} then deoxygenated through N 2 bubbling for 30  min, which produced a dark orange-colored solution. Afterwards, 2  mL of NH 4 OH was added dropwise under vigorous stirring in an inert environment. The solution was next heated up to 70  °C for 1  h and the flocculate was magnetically decanted several times, and then re-dispersed in deionized water obtaining a <b>black</b> solution of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide.</b> One third of the as-prepared solution was freeze-dried in vacuum. The resultant product was labeled as bare SPION in order to compare them to their PEG-coated counterparts. In a separate step, 40 % (w/v) aqueous solution of PEG was added to {{two thirds of the}} remaining solution, being then rapidly probe-sonicated at room temperature at a frequency of 5  Hz. The resultant solution was washed many times with abundant water in order to remove uncoated PEG NPs via centrifugation at 8000  rpm for 30  min. Finally, it was freeze-dried in vacuum for 48  h obtaining powders of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> labeled as PEG-SPION. The weight ratio of PEG/SPION was set at ~ 1 : 10.|$|R
