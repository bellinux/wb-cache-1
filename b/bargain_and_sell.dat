40|$|Richard Leonard was {{a member}} of the 104 th Regiment of the British Army. He fought during the War of 1812 at Sackett’s Harbour, Lundy’s Lane and Fort Erie. After the war he settled at Lundy’s Lane and was {{appointed}} lieutenant colonel of the 1 st Lincoln Militia. He later became the Sheriff of Niagara. He died in 1833 and is buried in the Drummond Hill Cemetery. A legal document involving John D M’Kay, Thomas Butler, and John Harris, dated February 5, 1828. The document was created by Richard Leonard, Sheriff of the District of Niagara. The document states that Leonard had been ordered to “cause to be levied of the lands and tenements of John D M’Kay as well a certain debt of six hundred pounds which Thomas Butler lately recovered in the said Court against the said John D M’Kay”. Leonard continues that “I did seize and take in execution of the said writ the lands and tenements [...] . and have sold the same at public auction attending to the Statutes in such case made and provided to John Harris of the Township of Grimsby…for the sum of seven pounds ten shillings of lawful money of Upper Canada being the highest sum bid for the same. ” The second paragraph of the document concerns a hundred acres of land in Grimsby. It states that “I the said Richard Leonard…by virtue of the said execution and of the Statutes in such case made and provided in consideration of the said sum of seven pounds ten shillings to me in hand paid by the said John Harris…and by these presents do grant, <b>bargain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sell</b> unto the said John Harris…in the Township of Grimsby…one hundred acres of land…and all the estate, right, title and interest of the said John D M’Cay of in and to the said parcel and tract of land”...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} giving a player an outside option can worsen his payoff in a {{bargaining}} game with strategic delay. If the seller has {{the option to}} terminate <b>bargaining</b> <b>and</b> <b>sell</b> the good on the spot market, this can limit {{the ability of a}} low-valuation buyer to use delayed responses to signal her type. As a result, high-valuation buyers cannot immediately accept a seller´s offer with probability one, worsening the seller´s payoff. ...|$|R

60|$|The {{impression}} made {{upon their}} greedy minds was immediately apparent. One of the band, a young man, {{and the least}} known, requested permission of the captain to depart the following day in disguise for Rome, {{for the purpose of}} traffick; promising on the faith of a bandit (a sacred pledge amongst them) to return in two days to any place he might appoint. The captain consented, and a curious scene took place. The robbers crowded round him eagerly, confiding to him such of their jewels as they wished to dispose of, and giving him instructions what to demand. There was <b>bargaining</b> <b>and</b> exchanging <b>and</b> <b>selling</b> of trinkets among themselves, and I beheld my watch, which had a chain and valuable seals, purchased by the young robber merchant of the ruffian who had plundered me, for sixty dollars. I now conceived a faint hope that if it went to Rome, I might somehow or other regain possession of it.|$|R

Gain-seeking has been considered the sole driving force in much, if not all, modeling of individual <b>bargaining</b> <b>and</b> contracting behavior. Nevertheless, {{the relevance of the}} normative effects on <b>bargaining</b> <b>and</b> contracting has {{for a number of reasons}} become more important. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{long time}} ago most economists would have limited {{themselves}} to stating that agreements should be individually rational and efficient and that selecting a specific agreement from that set depends on <b>bargaining</b> <b>and</b> negotiation power whatever that may be.

The change has been {{brought about by the}} strategic approach to <b>bargaining</b> <b>and</b> cooperation and the parallel experimental studies of <b>bargaining</b> <b>and</b> negotiation. When arguing what should be explored more thoroughly, we will point out directions where previous efforts may have been misdirected, where importing new methods may be helpful or even needed, and where new research questions need to be asked and answered.

It denoted, of course, the number 267; and that, being pretty {{near to the}} number of miles which it was thought the ship would {{probably}} make, was considered quite a valuable ticket. The owners of the several tickets, as soon as the drawing was completed, began to compare them and talk about them, <b>and</b> to propose <b>bargains</b> to one another for buying <b>and</b> <b>selling</b> them, or exchanging them. In these negotiations each man was endeavoring to outwit and circumvent his friend, in hopes of buying his ticket for a moderate sum, and drawing the whole prize with it. Others were engaged in betting on particular tickets. These bets, when they were made, they recorded in little memorandum books kept for the purpose. In fact, a very noisy and tumultuous scene of <b>bargaining,</b> <b>and</b> betting, and barter ensued.|$|R

A discrete choice model of the choice of marketing channels is developed which accounts for the role of selectivity bias. Farmers {{who are most likely to}} sell through a diversified set of outlets or to use a single outlet have increased earnings relative to farmers who overlook these marketing options. Producers with less experience gravitate toward use of a single marketing outlet while more experienced producers tend to diversify and market through all three channels. Constraints in selling organic products tends tend to have a negative effect on farm income. ...|$|R
