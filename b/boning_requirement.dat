While factors controlling their mechanical and biological response {{have recently been}} the subject of intense research, the interplay between mechanical properties, bone ingrowth requirements,and manufacturing constraints, is still unclear. In this paper, we present two high-strength stretch-dominated topologies, the Tetrahedron and the Octet truss, as well as an intuitive visualization method to understand the relationship of cell topology, pore size, porosity with constraints imposed by <b>bone</b> ingrowth <b>requirements</b> and additive manufacturing.

40|$|BACKGROUND: One of the {{greatest}} problems in treating advanced prostate carcinoma is monitoring the therapeutic response of bone metastases. As these metastases are mainly osteosclerotic and lead to a markedly increased <b>bone</b> calcium <b>requirement</b> that may give rise to an imbalance in calcium homeostasis, the authors investigated whether changes in calcium balance may be useful for evaluating the response of bone metastases to treatment. METHODS: The study involved 268 prostate carcinoma patients: 142 in Stage A-C 2 (International Union Against Cancer [UICC] staging system, 1998) and 126 with bone metastases who had {{failed to respond to}} hormone therapy and were receiving chemotherapy. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), calcium and phosphate metabolism, and the main bone formation and resorption markers were all assayed before and after chemotherapy. RESULTS: Of the 126 patients on chemotherapy, 109 were evaluable for response: according to standard criteria, 25 (23...|$|R
40|$|Determining calcium {{bioavailability}} {{is important}} in establishing dietary calcium requirements. In infants and small children, previously conducted mass balance studies have largely been replaced by stable isotope-based studies. The ability to assess calcium absorption using a relatively short 24 -hour urine collection {{without the need for}} multiple blood samples or fecal collections is a major advantage to this technique. The results of these studies have demonstrated relatively small differences in calcium absorption efficiency between human milk and currently available cow milk-based infant formulas. In older children with a calcium intake typical of Western diets, calcium absorption is adequate to meet <b>bone</b> mineral accretion <b>requirements...</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{people with}} {{alcoholic}} hepatitis, the {{serum aspartate aminotransferase}} (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio is greater than 2:1.AST and ALT levels are almost always less than 500. The elevated AST to ALT ratio is due to deficiency of pyridoxal-6-phosphate, which is required in the ALT enzyme synthetic pathway. Furthermore, alcohol metabolite–induced injury of hepatic mitochondria results in AST isoenzyme release. Other laboratory findings include red blood cell macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume > 100) and elevations of serum γ-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels. Folate level is reduced in alcoholic patients due to decreased intestinal absorption, increased <b>bone</b> marrow <b>requirement</b> for folate {{in the presence of}} alcohol, and increased urinary loss.The magnitude of leukocytosis reflects severity of liver injury. Histologic features include Mallory bodies, giant mitochondria, hepatocyte necrosis, and neutrophil infiltration at the perivenular area. Mallory bodies, which are also present in other liver diseases, are condensations of cytokeratin components in the hepatocyte cytoplasm and do not contribute to liver injury.Up to 70% of patients with moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis already have cirrhosis identifiable on biopsy examination at the time of diagnosis.|$|R
40|$|Bioceramics in {{the form}} of {{scaffolds}} hold great promise in bone tissue regeneration. While the scaffold composition is important for biocompatibility, the internal architecture {{plays a key role in}} allowing proper cell penetration, nutrient diffusion, bone ingrowth, vascularization as well as mechanical properties. A solid freeform fabrication is a promising processing technique, allowing to study structural parameters independently. This bachelor thesis is focused on ceramic bone replacements with different internal structure. The thesis is divided into 8 chapters. The first four chapters briefly summarize the current state of the art in the following fields: <b>bone</b> structure, <b>requirements</b> for synthetic <b>bone</b> replacements, scaffold architecture, and fabrication methods with an emphasis on 3 D printing. The next chapters deal with experimental part. The image analysis of mouse skeleton was performed. On the basis of the measured pore size (50 200 m) and according to the literature search, 16 structures with various shape, curvature and pore size were designed. The CAD models were printed by a stereolithography from a tricalcium phosphate dispersion. Sintered ceramic scaffolds exhibited an ideal structure for application in bone tissue engineering. Scaffolds contained both interconnected macro- and micropores of optimal sizes up to 500 m and about 3 m, respectively. The results confirm that stereolithography is suitable, and compared to others, precise method for preparing scaffolds having different internal structures. The individual structural characteristics influencing the scaffold behaviour will be possible to study independently to each other. And thus improve the scientific knowledge in the field of treatment of large segmental bone defects...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{materials}} have shown {{their ability to}} adapt their geometry in response to mechanical stress. In examining their shape and structure, it becomes apparent that the major strategic function of structural materials and systems involves mechanical support under changing load. This comparison study examines how the morphology of four biological materials (bone, wood, plant stems, and blood vessels) is influenced by environmental loading conditions. As these materials remodel their shape through adaptive growth, they seek to maintain an optimal structure that is able to sustain a particular mechanical support <b>requirement.</b> <b>Bone</b> and wood adapt to increased mechanical load by increasing their density while plant stems and blood vessels develop thicker vessel walls. For bone, trabecular bone density and cortical bone thickness are increased with load {{in order to maintain}} a roughly constant peak functional strain; wood and blood vessels remodel their shape under elevated levels of stress in order to maintain a constant surface stress and constant circumferential stress, respectively. In addition, plant stems and blood vessels whic...|$|R
30|$|The {{incidence}} of fixator-related problems, however, can prolong {{the duration of}} external fixation [8, 9]. Patients must often wear fixators for long periods and the healing index (HI) varies from 35 to 58  days/cm, depending on the publication [5, 10, 11]. Longer periods of fixator attachment are associated with numerous complications: local and deep infections, joint stiffness, delayed consolidation, axial deviation and fractures after frame removal, and a significant psychological impact on the patient [12, 13, 14, 15]. Lengthening over nail in adults or fully implantable lengthening nails {{have been described as}} techniques which permit the early removal of external fixators or make them unnecessary, providing protection against refracture and earlier rehabilitation [3, 16]. However, in children, the use of rigid intramedullary nails alone can cause physeal injuries and proximal femoral osteonecrosis [17]. Major complications have been reported, including osteomyelitis, mechanical failure of the intramedullary device, prolonged <b>bone</b> consolidation, transfusion <b>requirements,</b> collapse of the lengthened segment with breakage of locking screws and the risk of the nail becoming unreachable inside the canal [18, 19, 20]. Furthermore, the presence of an open physis meant that lengthening over nail or implantable nails are contraindicated in children, and an implantable nail can only be used after epiphyseal closure [21].|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} cut and shape <b>bone</b> is a <b>requirement</b> for {{orthopaedic}} and maxillofacial surgery. Modern tools are just powered versions of traditional instruments. New methods of cutting have potential benefits that are difficult or impossible to achieve with existing tools, such as miniaturisation or an inherent protection against cutting soft tissues. However, these new cutting technologies must still prove {{to be successful in}} cutting mineralised tissues. An amputation saw, powered sagittal saw (commonly used for arthroplasty procedures) and new ultrasonic bone scalpel, representing the last 200 years of bone surgery, were compared in a standardised fashion. Cutting time, temperature and cell death were evaluated. The amputation saw was found to cut with the lowest temperature and the least cell death but required the greatest bone exposure. The sagittal saw cut the fastest but also resulted in the greatest cell death. The ultrasonic powered blade created the greatest temperature and was also the slowest, but caused less cell death than the currently used sagittal saw. However, temperature and cell death were significantly reduced by the application of a cooling spray. It was concluded that current ultrasonic devices are not suitable for thick cortical bone, but may be useful for cutting thinner bones, especially those close to critical soft tissues...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{ultrasonic}} orthopaedic surgical {{device is}} presented, where the ultrasonic actuation {{relies on a}} modification of the classical cymbal transducer. All current devices consist of a Langevin ultrasonic transducer with a tuned cutting blade attached, where resonance is required to provide sufficient vibrational amplitude to cut <b>bone.</b> However, this <b>requirement</b> restricts the geometry and offers little opportunity to propose miniaturised devices or complex blades. The class V flextensional cymbal transducer is proposed here {{as the basis for}} a new design, where the cymbal delivers the required vibrational amplitude, and the design of the attached cutting insert can be tailored for the required cut. Consequently, the device can be optimised to deliver an accurate and precise cutting capability. A prototype device is presented, based on the cymbal configuration and designed to operate at 25. 5 kHz with a displacement amplitude of 30 μm at 300 V. Measurements of vibrational and impedance responses elucidate the mechanical and electrical characteristics of the device. Subsequent cutting tests on rat femur demonstrate device performance consistent with a commercial Langevin-based ultrasonic device and show that cutting is achieved using less electrical power and a lower piezoceramic volume. Histological analysis exhibits a higher proportion of live cells in the region around the cut site for the cymbal device than for a powered sagittal or a manual saw, demonstrating the potential for the ultrasonic device to result in faster healing...|$|R
40|$|Air Space Proportion (ASP) is {{a measure}} of how much air is present within a bone, which allows for a {{quantifiable}} comparison of pneumaticity between specimens and species. Measured from zero to one, higher ASP means more air and less bone. Conventionally, it is estimated from measurements of the internal and external bone diameter, or by analyzing cross-sections. To date, the only pterosaur ASP study has been carried out by visual inspection of sectioned bones within matrix. Here, computed tomography (CT) scans are used to calculate ASP in a small sample of pterosaur wing bones (mainly phalanges) and to assess how the values change throughout the bone. These results show higher ASPs than previous pterosaur pneumaticity studies, and more significantly, higher ASP values in the heads of wing bones than the shaft. This suggests that pneumaticity has been underestimated previously in pterosaurs, birds, and other archosaurs when shaft cross-sections are used to estimate ASP. Furthermore, ASP in pterosaurs is higher than those found in birds and most sauropod dinosaurs, giving them among the highest ASP values of animals studied so far, supporting the view that pterosaurs were some of the most pneumatized animals to have lived. The high degree of pneumaticity found in pterosaurs is proposed to be a response to the wing <b>bone</b> bending stiffness <b>requirements</b> of flight rather than a means to reduce mass, as is often suggested. Mass reduction may be a secondary result of pneumaticity that subsequently aids flight...|$|R
40|$|Background: Adipose {{tissue is}} an {{attractive}} source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) due to its abundance and accessibility. Previous studies have defined a population of native MSC termed perivascular stem cells (PSC), purified from diverse human tissues, including adipose tissue. Human (h) PSC are a homologous population composed of pericytes (CD 146 +CD 34 &# 8722;CD 45 &# 8722;) and adventitial cells (CD 146 &# 8722;CD 34 +CD 45 &# 8722;), isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), with properties identical to those of culture identified MSC. The evidence supporting the use of human perivascular stem cells (hPSC) for bone tissue engineering is based on our prior studies: firstly, pancreas- (and other organ-) derived human pericytes exhibit robust in vitro osteogenic differentiation and intramuscular bone formation and angiogenesis[31]; next, adipose-derived hPSC form significantly increased intramuscular bone compared to patient-matched unpurified cells and demonstrate in vivo trophic and angiogenic effects[32, 33], and lastly adipose-derived hPSC exhibited improved calvarial bone defect healing as compared to unsorted SVF[34]. Methods: Athymic rats(n= 5 - 6 per treatment group) were randomly distributed into four treatment groups of escalating human PSC(hPSC) dose, delivered on a demineralized bone matrix scaffold. After four weeks, animals were sacrificed and spinal fusion was assessed by manual palpation, high-resolution micro-Computed Tomography(microCT) and histology. Computerized biomechanical assays were performed using finite element analysis(FEA). Finally, immunohistochemistry, with anti-human/anti-rat Major Histocompatibility Complex Class (MHC) Class I, was performed to assay the origin of newly formed bone. Results: Treatment with hPSC successfully induced 80 - 100 % fusion by four weeks compared to acellular-treated controls (20 % fusion), confirmed by microCT and histological analyses. Biomechanically, {{it was observed that}} hPSC treatment induced more sound bone, capable of withstanding significantly higher force compared to control. Lastly, using immunostaining, it was observed that rat-specific osteoblasts outnumbered human-specific osteoblasts by a ratio of 3. 9 - 10 : 1. Likewise, rat-specific osteocytes outnumbered human-specific osteocytes by a ratio of 7. 8 - 30. 8 : 1, indicating that hPSC operate to a large degree via paracrine signaling. Immunohistochemistry for species-specific antigens verified that hPSC play a direct role in bone formation, but also that hPSC play a role in paracrine support of host osteoprogenitor cell recruitment and/or differentiation. Conclusion: hPSC are a readily available MSC population that effectively forms <b>bone</b> without <b>requirements</b> for culture, pre-differentiation or exogenous cytokine stimulation. Thus, hPSC-based products show promise for future efforts in clinical bone regeneration and repair...|$|R
40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) {{is the most}} common and the most severe of the neuromuscular disorders. Affecting 1 in 3, 500 boys, the disease causes progressive and relentless muscle weakness, limiting life to the second or third decade. The mainstay of medical management involves the use of glucocorticosteroids which has significantly altered the natural history of the disease. The nutritional issues associated with DMD are complex, yet poorly understood. To date, these issues have not been an important priority of care; but as life expectancy slowly inches forward, such concerns warrant immediate attention. This thesis aims to progress the understanding and management of nutritional issues for boys with DMD by advancing the evidence base. Five distinct lines of investigation were undertaken under this broader theme. Firstly, a comprehensive literature review highlighted many gaps in the literature specifically in the areas of energy <b>requirements,</b> <b>bone</b> health, micronutrient <b>requirements</b> (vitamin D), growth monitoring, and use of novel amino acids and nutritional supplements. Secondly, a retrospective case series documented the genetic, physical and clinical profile of boys with DMD living in Australia, {{and for the first time}} a relationship between genotype and function was elucidated; boys with a deletion in the dystrophin gene are more likely to stop walking before age 10 years. Whilst the relationship between growth and walking ability was unclear, a higher body mass index (BMI) may be protective against a decline in lung function. This analysis also provides evidence for commencing steroid treatment earlier, as a longer duration of steroid treatment was associated with walking past age 10 years, and increased lung function. Next, vitamin D status in boys with DMD was explored. Young, ambulatory boys with DMD who attend regular school were found to have low serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D when compared to their healthy siblings, a finding that was not explained by differences in sun exposure. Also, a series of meta-analyses demonstrated that steroid therapy is associated with suboptimal serum vitamin D concentrations, and may potentially explain the observed reduction in 25 -hydroxyvitamin D. Based on data obtained by meta-analysis, recommendations for vitamin D supplementation should, at a minimum, be 1800 IU (45 µg) /d for boys with DMD receiving steroid therapy. Chapter four presents data and literature to support the use of selected outcome measures for dietary trials in DMD, specifically: StepWatch™ activity monitoring, the six minute walk test, and a three day food diary. These functional outcome measures were found to be sensitive to differences in ambulatory capacity in boys with DMD when compared to control participants. Furthermore, self-reported energy intake using food diaries was similar to total energy expenditure as determined by doubly labelled water in boys with DMD. Finally, a pilot randomised control trial is described in which a novel nutritional supplement incorporating whey protein, creatine monohydrate, glutamine and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate is investigated. Results indicate that a 50 week nutriceutical intervention is feasible, and may improve functional outcome measures when used in conjunction with steroid treatment. This thesis comprises of several smaller studies that are linked in a framework of empirical research. Firstly, the evidence base for nutritional management of boys with DMD, and their nutritional status across two major paediatric clinic populations nationally is examined. The thesis then further explores confounding factors of nutritional status and determines methodology to measure these before piloting a novel nutriceutical intervention informed by the best available evidence. This body of work, with its purely nutritional focus, is the first of its kind, and will assist dietitians to provide evidence based care to this courageous group of children...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic cutting {{technology}} has been introduced for surgical applications since the 1950 s. Ultrasonic bone cutting applies high frequency mechanical vibration of a blade tuned at a specific frequency to make incision on human hard tissues. It offers advantages such as improved safety, smooth and precise cutting. To facilitate the design of high performance surgical ultrasonic bone cutting blades, this thesis {{is devoted to the}} modelling and designing of ultrasonic blades with an attempt to better understand the dynamic characteristics of blade and improve the conventional design method. A non-coupled vibration analytical model which deals with four modes of vibration, including longitudinal oscillation, flexural bending, lateral bending, and torsional vibration of ultrasonic blades, was proposed based on one-dimensional theories. The model allows the estimation of the modal parameters of a blade without establishing a 3 D model. The experimental study of this model using a uniform beam and a sectional ultrasonic blade showed that the model predicted the modal frequencies of these structures with satisfactory accuracy. This suggested that the analytical model can be used as an alternative method to FEA in the characterisation of ultrasonic blades. Two coupled models, a parametric vibration model and a longitudinal-bending coupled vibration model, were proposed to study the coupled vibration of ultrasonic blades. The parametric vibration model formulated the coupled vibration using a lumped mass beam. This enabled the investigation of interaction between the vibration modes based on a simple one-dimensional structure. However, this model resulted in governing equations of considerable complexity, which were considered to be more suitable for the purpose of theoretical study instead of performance prediction. In addition, a longitudinal-bending coupled model was proposed in this study with an attempt to understand a type of coupled vibration that is commonly observed in ultrasonic blades of beam-like profile. The model was established by introducing an extra rotation moment in the one-dimensional bending equation. Two numerical iteration approaches, with their implementation and error analysis detailed, were proposed to solve this model. An optimal design method was proposed in this study with an aim to improve the conventional design process of ultrasonic blades by applying mathematical algorithms instead of the designers' experience and intuition to optimise the design. The method was introduced based on the concept of performance indicators that measure specific physical characteristics of a blade using mathematical functions. Four kinds of indicators, the frequency based, gain based, displacement based and stress based indicators, which evaluate the main dynamic characteristics of ultrasonic blades, were detailed in this study. The process of the optimal design method consists of three major stages: formulation, optimisation and verification. The concept of the proposed method is to maximise the blade performance through the optimisation of the performance indicators. This can improve the quality of design by making sure the most desired characteristics are achieved in the blade. A software toolkit was developed using the Abaqus script interface and Python language in order to apply this method in the design of ultrasonic blades. Five ultrasonic bone cutting blades with different types of cutting edges were designed using either the conventional or the optimal design method. These blades were subjected to ultrasonic cutting tests under various cutting conditions. Ultrasonic cutting performed on biomechanical samples, ovine femur and rat bones showed that the blades were capable of making incisions on <b>bones</b> without the <b>requirement</b> of large applied force. Positive linear correlation between the applied force and the cutting speed was found in the ultrasonic cutting carried out under static applied force, and positive linear relationship between the applied force and the surface temperature was observed in the ultrasonic cutting carried out under sliding motion. The presence of elevated temperatures in the cutting tests suggested that the blades require the application of cooling in ultrasonic bone cutting. The study confirmed that the proposed optimal design method was an effective design approach. The blades were designed with expected vibration characteristics and satisfactory cutting performance...|$|R
