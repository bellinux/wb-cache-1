5|$|The main or primary <b>bronchi</b> {{enter the}} lungs at the hilum and {{initially}} branch into secondary <b>bronchi</b> {{also known as}} lobar <b>bronchi</b> that supply air to each lobe of the lung. The lobar <b>bronchi</b> branch into tertiary <b>bronchi</b> also known as segmental <b>bronchi</b> and these supply air to the further divisions of the lobes known as bronchopulmonary segments. Each bronchopulmonary segment has its own (segmental) bronchus and arterial supply. Segments for {{the left and right}} lung are shown in the table. The segmental anatomy is useful clinically for localising disease processes in the lungs. A segment is a discrete unit that can be surgically removed without seriously affecting surrounding tissue.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{are part}} of the lower {{respiratory}} tract, and accommodate the bronchial airways when they branch from the trachea. The lungs include the bronchial airways that terminate in alveoli, the lung tissue in between, and veins, arteries, nerves and lymphatic vessels. The trachea and <b>bronchi</b> have plexuses of lymph capillaries in their mucosa and submucosa. The smaller <b>bronchi</b> have a single layer and they are absent in the alveoli.|$|E
5|$|Diagnostic or {{therapeutic}} {{manipulation of}} the airway (such as bronchoscopy, laser therapy or stenting of the <b>bronchi)</b> may intermittently interfere {{with the ability to}} breathe; intubation may be necessary in such situations.|$|E
5|$|Stage IV or AIDS: severe {{symptoms}} {{which include}} toxoplasmosis of the brain, candidiasis of the esophagus, trachea, <b>bronchi</b> or lungs and Kaposi's sarcoma. A CD4 count {{of less than}} 200/µl.|$|E
5|$|The larynx, trachea, <b>bronchi</b> {{and lungs}} {{that make up}} the {{respiratory}} tract, begin to form during the fourth week of embryogenesis from the lung bud which appears ventrally to the caudal portion of the foregut.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the lower}} {{respiratory}} tract including the trachea, <b>bronchi,</b> and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. This is a ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucus, and club cells with actions similar to macrophages. Incomplete rings of cartilage in the trachea and smaller plates of cartilage in the <b>bronchi,</b> keep these airways open. Bronchioles are too narrow to support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium. The respiratory tract ends in lobules. Each lobule consists of a respiratory bronchiole, which branches into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, which in turn divide into alveoli.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{can also}} be used in the {{treatment}} of tumours of the brain, eye, head and neck region (lip, floor of mouth, tongue, nasopharynx and oropharynx), respiratory tract (trachea and <b>bronchi),</b> digestive tract (oesophagus, gall bladder, bile-ducts, rectum, anus), urinary tract (bladder, urethra, penis), female reproductive tract (uterus, vagina, vulva), and soft tissues.|$|E
5|$|In small-cell lung {{carcinoma}} (SCLC), {{the cells}} contain dense neurosecretory granules (vesicles containing neuroendocrine hormones), which give this tumor an endocrine/paraneoplastic syndrome association. Most cases {{arise in the}} larger airways (primary and secondary <b>bronchi).</b> Sixty to seventy percent have extensive disease (which cannot be targeted within a single radiation therapy field) at presentation.|$|E
5|$|The trachea and <b>bronchi</b> {{form the}} tracheobronchial tree. The trachea is {{situated}} between {{the lower end}} of the larynx and the center of the chest, where it splits into the two <b>bronchi</b> at a ridge called the carina. The trachea is stabilized and kept open by rings made of cartilage that surround the front and sides of the structure; these rings are not closed and do not surround the back, which is made of membrane. The <b>bronchi</b> split into smaller branches and then to bronchioles that supply air to the alveoli, the tiny air-filled sacs in the lungs responsible for absorbing oxygen. An arbitrary division can be made between the intrathoracic and cervical trachea at the thoracic inlet, an opening at the top of the thoracic cavity. Anatomical structures that surround and protect the tracheobronchial tree include the lungs, the esophagus, large blood vessels, the rib cage, the thoracic spine, and the sternum. Children have softer tracheas and a more elastic tracheobronchial trees than adults; this elasticity, which helps protect the structures from injury when they are compressed, may contribute to the lower incidence of TBI in children.|$|E
5|$|The tuatara is {{considered}} the most unspecialised living amniote; the brain and mode of locomotion resemble those of amphibians and the heart is more primitive than {{that of any other}} reptile. The lungs have a single chamber and lack <b>bronchi.</b>|$|E
5|$|The viral {{infection}} that causes croup leads to {{swelling of the}} larynx, trachea, and large <b>bronchi</b> due to infiltration of white blood cells (especially histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils). Swelling produces airway obstruction which, when significant, leads to dramatically increased work of breathing and the characteristic turbulent, noisy airflow known as stridor.|$|E
5|$|Tracheobronchial injury (TBI) is {{damage to}} the tracheobronchial tree (the airway {{structure}} involving the trachea and <b>bronchi).</b> It can result from blunt or penetrating trauma to the neck or chest, inhalation of harmful fumes or smoke, or aspiration of liquids or objects.|$|E
5|$|Lesions can be transverse, {{occurring}} {{between the}} rings of the trachea, longitudinal or spiral. They may occur along the membranous {{part of the}} trachea, the main <b>bronchi,</b> or both. In 8% of ruptures, lesions are complex, occurring {{in more than one}} location, with more than one type of lesion, or on both of the main <b>bronchi</b> and the trachea. Transverse tears are more common than longitudinal or complex ones. The laceration may completely transect the airway or it may go only partway around. Partial tears that do not go {{all the way around the}} circumference of the airway do not allow a lacerated airway to become completely detached; tears that encircle the whole airway can allow separation to occur. Lacerations may also be classified as complete or incomplete. In an incomplete lesion, a layer of tissue surrounding the bronchus remains intact and can keep the air in the airway, preventing it from leaking into the areas surrounding the airways. Incomplete lacerations may require closer scrutiny to detect and may not be diagnosed right away.|$|E
5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or <b>bronchi.</b> Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E
5|$|In many people, the {{infection}} waxes and wanes. Tissue destruction and necrosis are often balanced by healing and fibrosis. Affected tissue {{is replaced by}} scarring and cavities filled with caseous necrotic material. During active disease, some of these cavities are joined to the air passages <b>bronchi</b> and this material can be coughed up. It contains living bacteria, so can spread {{the infection}}. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics kills bacteria and allows healing to take place. Upon cure, affected areas are eventually replaced by scar tissue.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{diagnosis}} and treatment are important {{in the care of}} TBI; if the injury is not diagnosed shortly after the injury, the risk of complications is higher. Bronchoscopy is the most effective method to diagnose, locate, and determine the severity of TBI, and it is usually the only method that allows a definitive diagnosis. Diagnosis with a flexible bronchoscope, which allows the injury to be visualized directly, is the fastest and most reliable technique. In people with TBI, bronchoscopy may reveal that the airway is torn, or that the airways are blocked by blood, or that a bronchus has collapsed, obscuring more distal (lower) <b>bronchi</b> from view.|$|E
5|$|Tuataras superficially {{resemble}} lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) {{on either}} side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down. The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack <b>bronchi.</b> The tuatara has a well-developed parietal eye on its forehead.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians were {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} breathe like mammals, with airflow {{moving in and}} out tidally, but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude that crocodilians breathe more like birds, with airflow moving in a unidirectional loop within the lungs. When a crocodilian inhales, air flows through the trachea and into two primary <b>bronchi,</b> or airways, which branch off into narrower secondary passageways. The air continues to move through these, then into even narrower tertiary airways, and then into other secondary airways which were bypassed the first time. The air then flows back into the primary airways and is exhaled back out. These aerodynamic valves within the bronchial tree have been hypothesised to explain how crocodilians can have unidirectional airflow without the aid of avian-like air sacs.|$|E
5|$|DPB and bronchiolitis obliterans are {{two forms}} of primary bronchiolitis. Specific {{overlapping}} features of both diseases include strong cough with large amounts of often pus-filled sputum; nodules viewable on lung X-rays in the lower <b>bronchi</b> and bronchiolar area; and chronic sinusitis. In DPB, the nodules are more restricted to the respiratory bronchioles, while in OB they are often found in the membranous bronchioles (the initial non-cartilaginous section of the bronchiole, that divides from the tertiary bronchus) up to the secondary bronchus. OB is a bronchiolar disease with worldwide prevalence, while DPB has more localized prevalence, predominantly in Japan. Prior to clinical recognition of DPB in recent years, it was often misdiagnosed as bronchiectasia, COPD, IPF, phthisis miliaris, sarcoidosis or alveolar cell carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{respiratory}} tract {{is part of the}} respiratory system, and consists of the trachea and the structures below this including the lungs. The trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place where it splits (the carina) into a right and left bronchus. These supply air to the right and left lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary and tertiary <b>bronchi</b> for the lobes of the lungs, and into smaller and smaller bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles. These in turn supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of gases take place. Oxygen breathed in, diffuses through the walls of the alveoli into the enveloping capillaries and into the circulation, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be breathed out.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{of mammals}} are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly {{achieved}} with the diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing {{the volume of}} the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and <b>bronchi,</b> and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing {{the volume of the}} lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of the common cold {{are believed to be}} primarily related to the immune response to the virus. The mechanism of this immune response is virus specific. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to human ICAM-1 receptors through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. It does not generally cause damage to the nasal epithelium. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the lower respiratory tract. RSV does cause epithelium damage. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and <b>bronchi.</b> In young children when it affects the trachea it may produce the {{symptoms of}} croup due to the small size of their airways.|$|E
5|$|If {{granulation}} tissue grows over the injured site, {{it can cause}} stenosis of the airway, after a week to a month. The {{granulation tissue}} must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a bronchial rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens hospital stay. People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the bronchiole is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. Lung tissue distal to a completely obstructed bronchiole often does not become infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this tissue remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the lung is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs distal to a partially obstructed bronchiole. Infected lung tissue distal to a stricture can be damaged, and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the stenosis may cause bronchiectasis, in which <b>bronchi</b> are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a stricture is restored to normal, the resulting loss of lung function may be permanent.|$|E
5|$|The {{respiratory}} tract has a branching structure {{like that of}} a tree. In the embryo this structure is developed in the process of branching morphogenesis, and is generated by the repeated splitting of the tip of the branch. In the development of the lungs (as in some other organs) the epithelium forms branching tubes.The lung has a left-right symmetry and each bud known as a bronchial bud grows out as a tubular epithelium that becomes a bronchus. Each bronchus branches into bronchioles. The branching {{is a result of the}} tip of each tube bifurcating. The branching process forms the <b>bronchi,</b> bronchioles, and ultimately the alveoli. The four genes mostly associated with branching morphogenesis in the lung are the intercellular signalling protein – sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factors FGF10 and FGFR2b, and bone morphogenetic protein BMP4. FGF10 is seen to have the most prominent role. FGF10 is a paracrine signalling molecule needed for epithelial branching, and SHH inhibits FGF10. The development of the alveoli is influenced by a different mechanism whereby continued bifurcation is stopped and the distal tips become dilated to form the alveoli.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>bronchi</b> {{to branch}} from the trachea {{are the right}} and left main <b>bronchi.</b> Second only in {{diameter}} to the trachea (1.8cm), these <b>bronchi</b> (1 -1.4cm in diameter) enter the lungs at each hilum, where they branch into narrower secondary <b>bronchi</b> known as lobar <b>bronchi,</b> and these branch into narrower tertiary <b>bronchi</b> known as segmental <b>bronchi.</b> Further divisions of the segmental <b>bronchi</b> (1 to 6mm in diameter) are known as 4th order, 5th order, and 6th order segmental <b>bronchi,</b> or grouped together as subsegmental <b>bronchi.</b>|$|E
25|$|Foreign {{body in the}} <b>bronchi</b> {{can also}} present as chronic cough.|$|E
25|$|Theophylline (4%): Relaxes smooth {{muscles of}} the <b>bronchi,</b> and is used to treat asthma. The {{therapeutic}} dose of theophylline, however, is many {{times greater than the}} levels attained from caffeine metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation of the trachea {{is known}} as tracheitis. When the trachea is {{inflamed}} {{as well as the}} larynx and <b>bronchi,</b> this {{is known as}} croup, which often causes a distinct, barking cough.|$|E
25|$|The {{respiratory}} tube {{is also known}} in LACM 128319, preserved as cartilaginous tracheal rings. Only the posterior-most end of the tracheal tube – {{at the end of}} the neck near the pectoral girdle – is known. The section where the two <b>bronchi</b> split was also preserved in the specimen, but was destroyed during excavation. This is an indication that Platecarpus and other mosasaurs had two functional lungs. Snakes, which are closely related to mosasaurs, have only one functional lung with the second often being vestigial or absent. Unlike terrestrial lizards, however, the <b>bronchi</b> separate in front of the area of the forelimbs rather than at the level of the limbs.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 43 to 75% {{of horses}} have {{blood in the}} trachea and <b>bronchi</b> {{following}} a single post-race endoscopic examination. In one study, all horses endoscoped on at least three separate occasions following racing had EIPH at least once.|$|E
25|$|EIPH is most {{commonly}} diagnosed by endoscopic {{examination of the}} trachea and larger <b>bronchi,</b> with the optimal timing for endoscopy being 60–90 minutes after hard exercise. This post-exercise delay allows time for blood within the lungs {{to travel to the}} trachea. Blood can usually be detected in the trachea or <b>bronchi</b> for 1–3 days after an episode of EIPH, but may be present for up to a week. The amount of blood visible in the trachea at the time of examination is {{most commonly}} graded on a scale of 0 (no blood) to 4 (airways awash with blood). In some mildly-affected horses, endoscopy must be performed on multiple occasions to confirm a diagnosis of EIPH.|$|E
25|$|Bronchitis is {{inflammation}} of the <b>bronchi</b> (large and medium-sized airways) in the lungs. Symptoms include coughing up mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort. Bronchitis {{is divided into two}} types: acute and chronic. Acute bronchitis is also known as a chest cold.|$|E
25|$|Aerosol {{particles}} with {{an effective}} diameter smaller than 10 μm {{can enter the}} <b>bronchi,</b> while the ones with an effective diameter smaller than 2.5 μm can enter {{as far as the}} gas exchange region in the lungs, which can be hazardous to human health.|$|E
25|$|In amphibians, the trachea is {{normally}} extremely short, and leads {{directly into the}} lungs, without clear primary <b>bronchi.</b> A longer trachea is, however, found in some long-necked salamanders, and in caecilians. While there are irregular cartilagenous nodules on the amphibian trachea, these do not form the rings found in amniotes.|$|E
25|$|In birds, the trachea {{runs from}} the pharynx to the syrinx, from which the primary <b>bronchi</b> diverge. Swans have an unusually {{elongated}} trachea, part of which is coiled beneath the sternum; this may act as a resonator to amplify sound. In some birds, the tracheal rings are complete, and may even be ossified.|$|E
25|$|In {{humans and}} other mammals, {{the anatomy of}} a typical {{respiratory}} system is the respiratory tract. The tract is divided into an upper and a lower respiratory tract. The upper tract includes the nose, nasal cavities, sinuses, pharynx and {{the part of the}} larynx above the vocal folds. The lower tract (Fig.2.) includes {{the lower part of the}} larynx, the trachea, <b>bronchi,</b> bronchioles and the alveoli.|$|E
