My affiliation is with England. In fact, I'm starting to speak too much like Darren Gough... In fact, I'm going to get one of Gough's tattoos with three lions and my number underneath...No one can say I'm not English.|$|E
25|$|If I {{knew what}} I know now I {{probably}} would have switched. At the time I had already been playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long time. I thought I’d never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself.

25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

[...] Regarding their popularity, Yankovic has said, [...] "At this point, it's sort of mandatory for me to do a polka medley.
