5|$|Talbot died {{in about}} 1140, and his lands passed to Sybil, and her second husband, Josce de Dinan. He {{was buried in}} Gloucester Abbey. The lands at Swanscombe were divided between Talbot's two nieces, Cecily and Agnes, the daughters of Sybil and Pain fitzJohn. Cecily married first Roger of Hereford, son of Miles of Gloucester, and second William of Poitou and third Walter de Mayenne, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{children}} by any of her marriages and on her death in 1207, her lands passed to the heirs of her sister Agnes. Cecily's death without heirs also meant that the feudal barony of Swanscombe passed to her sister's heirs. Agnes married first Warin de Mountchesney and second Haldenald de Bidun, and her descendants held the barony of Swanscombe until 1324, when the line died out.|$|E

Katherine Tessman (née Lubben) was a Dutch immigrant, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{connection}} to the traditional reformed churches frequented by the Dutch American community such as the Reformed Church in America and the Christian Reformed Church. The dysfunction and tragedy of her early life gave her a strong testimony as {{the founder of the}} church.|$|E

500|$|Actress Lana Parrilla {{believed}} that Graham helped fill a void for her character, commenting that his loss [...] "was {{not easy for}} [...] That’s why, when she crushes his heart, there’s a tear {{coming out of her}} eye. She didn’t want to do it, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> choice — almost like how she had no choice to kill her father. I’m not saying I agree with it, but for the character, it’s what she had to do." [...] Parrilla also cited [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] as the first episode where viewers see [...] "how the two worlds collided," [...] a reference to Regina's ability to kill Graham by squeezing the heart of his fairytale counterpart. The revelation of the vault, Kitsis and Horowitz explained, [...] "is a very important thing for us in terms of moving forward in the season in that we wanted to send a very clear message that Regina knows what’s going on and has some very clear intentions in Storybrooke." [...] The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013.|$|E
500|$|Starting {{to appear}} more frequently, Dotty became a {{recurring}} character. Santer told Digital Spy in May 2009 that Dotty's storyline would go [...] "to a very, very dark place!" [...] He {{questioned whether the}} character was born bad or if her father had made her that way, and if she could be more dangerous than Nick. As the storyline between Dot, Dotty and Nick progressed, Nick's true agenda was revealed when he blackmailed his mother into giving him money for custody of Dotty. A BBC source told The Sun, [...] " [...] horrified when Nick tells her Dotty is for sale. He shows no emotion and his evil grin sends shivers down her spine. She always knew Nick would sell his soul {{for the price of}} some pick ’n mix <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea he’d sell his own daughter." [...] In a further plot twist, it was revealed to the audience in 2009, that Dotty was colluding with her father all along. The plot climaxed in June 2009 and marked Altman's departure from the show for the fourth time. Dotty later left on 23 February 2010.|$|E
2500|$|... "When the Virgin was {{entrusted}} to Joseph {{she was not}} {{entrusted to}} him for marriage, {{since he was a}} widower. He was called her husband because of the Law, but it is plainly follows from the Jewish tradition that the Virgin was not entrusted to him for matrimony. It was for the preservation of her virginity in witness to the things to come ... For because she had been betrothed to Joseph Mary appeared to be the wife of a husband, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> sexual relations with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> {{love for}} my Order. She is a Sulpitian. Yet we may all work to one end. Now {{if you were}} to speak to her, your Grace." ...|$|R

2500|$|Despite having {{achieved}} {{a circulation of}} 670,000 Talk magazine's publication was abruptly halted in January 2002 {{in the wake of}} the advertising recession following the 9/11 attacks. It was Brown's first very public failure <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> regrets about embarking on the project. She told Charlotte Edwardes of The Telegraph in 2002: [...] "My reputation rests on four magazines – three great successes, one that was a great experiment. I don't feel in any way let down. No big career doesn't have one flame out in it and there's nobody more boring than the undefeated." [...] Talk Media was founded in July 1998 by Miramax Films, Tina Brown and Ron Galotti to publishing books and Talk magazine and produce television programs. Talk Media formed a joint venture with Heart Magazines for the magazine only in February 1999. Brown worked with the book division's editor-in chief Jonathan Burnham. She recalled in October 2017 at the time of allegations of sexual assault being made against Harvey Weinstein: [...] "Strange contracts pre-dating us would suddenly surface, book deals with no deadline attached authored by attractive or nearly famous women".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{suspicious}} {{to begin}} with, Dot accepted them both into her home, believing that Nick truly had changed this time. Asked whether Nick {{really was a}} reformed character, Altman remained ambiguous: [...] "Nick's back, he's got a cute little daughter. He's become a plumber, he's a changed man. ...Or is he?" [...] As the storyline progressed, Nick's true agenda was revealed when he blackmailed his mother into giving him money for custody of Dotty. A BBC source reportedly told The Sun, [...] " [...] horrified when Nick tells her Dotty is for sale. He shows no emotion and his evil grin sends shivers down her spine. She always knew Nick would sell his soul {{for the price of}} some pick ’n mix <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea he’d sell his own daughter." [...] In a further plot twist, it was revealed to the audience in 2009, that Dotty (real name Kirsty) was colluding with her father all along. In the storyline, Dotty suggested killing Dot for her life assurance policy. Nick leaves following this, allowing Dotty to work on Dot and he returns three months later where they begin their plan to convince Dot and her friends that she is suffering with dementia; Nick's aim being to kill Dot and blame her death on her deteriorating mental state. During Nick's brief stay in the square, he overheard Billy Mitchell telling Dot how he let Jase Dyer die and Nick blackmailed Billy by demanding regular payments or he would tell Jase's son Jay what Billy did. When Billy's cousin, Phil, found out about this, he led Nick into the barrel store of The Queen Vic, where he beats him up and ties him to a chair. Phil gave Billy the opportunity to scare Nick off and end this, however, Billy let him go and told Jay the truth himself. The plot with his own daughter to kill his beloved mother climaxes on-screen in June 2009: Nick's plan goes awry after Dotty has a change of heart and ultimately rescues her grandmother from being poisoned, instead drugging Nick. This leads to a series of events whereby Nick, in a bid to escape once his plan has been exposed, holds various members of the community hostage in the café and an accidental fire is started after Heather Trott pushes Nick into the chip pan. The hostages manage to escape due to a fight between Nick and Ryan Malloy, {{who was one of the}} hostages. This results in an explosion at the café with Nick and Bradley Branning inside. The storyline marked Altman's departure from the show once again. His departing episode was scripted as a cliffhanger, as it was not revealed whether Nick had survived the explosion at the end of the episode. However, in the following episode, on 4 June 2009, Nick is shown to survive the explosion and Bradley is hospitalised with injuries to his eye. Nick departs after once again being disowned by Dot. Dotty is left in Dot's care despite Nick explaining to his mother that Dotty is evil.|$|E
