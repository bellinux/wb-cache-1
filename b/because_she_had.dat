5|$|In October 1944, the Frank {{women were}} {{scheduled}} to join a transport to the Liebau labour camp in Upper Silesia. Bloeme Evers-Emden {{was scheduled to be}} on this transport, but Anne was prohibited from going <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> developed scabies, and her mother and sister opted to stay with her. Bloeme went on without them.|$|E
5|$|Lea Thompson {{was cast}} as Lorraine McFly <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> acted {{opposite}} Stoltz in The Wild Life; the producers noticed {{her as they}} had watched the film while casting Stoltz.

5|$|After another {{stint in}} Japan, Sing {{returned}} to Stampede Wrestling in late 1987 and was renamed Rhonda Singh by Stu Hart, {{the owner of}} the company. There were plans to pair her with Gama Singh, but they never came to fruition. During 1987, she was named their first Women's Champion <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> defeated Wendi Richter prior to returning to Stampede. She held the title until September 22, 1988, when she lost to Chigusa Nagayo.|$|E
5|$|George Harrison met his wife-to-be, Patricia Boyd, {{on the set}} {{when she}} made a brief (uncredited) {{appearance}} {{as one of the}} schoolgirls on the train. His initial overtures to her were spurned <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a boyfriend at the time but he persisted and they were married within 18 months. The girl with Boyd in the dining car scene is Prudence Bury. Phil Collins, within a few years a band member of Genesis, was an uncredited schoolboy extra in the concert audience.|$|E
5|$|Halliwell was {{the first}} guest judge, and {{attended}} the Glasgow auditions. Imbruglia was the second guest judge, appearing for the Birmingham auditions. The guest judge slot was axed for the London auditions, but continued with Perry judging in Dublin, Lott in Cardiff and Scherzinger at the auditions in Manchester. Cole was unable to attend the Manchester auditions <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> contracted malaria and was not replaced for them.|$|E

5|$|Her first {{position}} as a professor was at Rutgers School of Law–Newark in 1963. The appointment was not without its drawbacks; Ginsburg was informed she would be paid less than her male colleagues <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a husband with a well-paid job. At the time Ginsburg entered academia, {{she was one of}} fewer than twenty female law professors in the United States. She was a professor of law, mainly civil procedure, at Rutgers from 1963 to 1972, receiving tenure from the school in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Mary soon {{experienced}} financial troubles, illnesses, and loneliness. In 1528, {{her aunt}} Margaret {{suggested that she}} should marry King James V of Scotland. Mary rejected the idea <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> loved her husband and did not wish another marriage. In 1530 Charles again suggested that she should remarry; he proposed to arrange a marriage to Frederick of Bavaria, who had unsuccessfully courted Mary's sister Eleanor sixteen years before. Mary rejected him as well.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Victor and {{his mother}} scream at each other <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> had sex with Oscar, {{and because of that}} Victor had {{informed}} the police about Oscar's drug dealing; Victor is then thrown out of his parents' home. He shows up at Linda's apartment and apologizes for having had her brother killed, but says Linda is partially to blame since she hung around with creeps. This angers Linda, who repeatedly screams that Victor should just go kill himself.|$|E

5|$|She {{attended}} Northwest Missouri State Teachers College, {{majoring in}} mathematics {{with a minor}} in English and graduating in 1945. Jennings was awarded the only mathematics degree in her class. Although she had originally intended to study journalism, she decided to change to mathematics <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a bad relationship with her adviser. Later in her life, she earned a master's degree in English at the University of Pennsylvania in 1967 and was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Northwest Missouri State University in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The Roda Codex, {{the sole}} source for Onneca's Christian marriage, places this union with her cousin Aznar Sánchez de Laron before her marriage, as a widow, to Abdullah of Córdoba. Based on this, French {{historian}} Évariste Lévi-Provençal developed a chronology for Onneca's life that placed her birth date around 835. Lévi-Provençal believed that Onneca did not accompany her {{father when he}} returned to Pamplona in 882, either <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> already died, or <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> converted to Islam and chose to remain in Abdullah's harem. However, such a chronology is problematic since it implies that Onneca's children by Aznar were born before or only shortly after her father's capture in 860, thus making Onneca's daughter Toda Aznárez a sexagenarian {{at the time of her}} son García Sánchez I's birth (which is known to have occurred in either 919 or 922), and nearly a centenarian at the time of her 958 visit to Cordoba. Therefore, most historians addressing the question have concluded that the Roda Codex was in error with regard to the order of Onneca's two marriages.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{argued that}} Sheila was the killer, {{and that she}} did {{know how to handle}} guns, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been raised on a farm and had {{attended}} shoots when she was younger. She had a very serious mental illness, had told a psychiatrist she felt capable of killing her children, and the loaded rifle and cartridges had been left on the kitchen table by Bamber. There had been a recent family argument about placing the children in foster care.|$|E

5|$|Between being {{commissioned}} in 1896 and {{the outbreak}} of the Spanish–American War in 1898, Massachusetts conducted training exercises off the eastern coast of the United States. During the war, she was placed in the Flying Squadron under Commodore Winfield Scott Schley. Schley went searching for Cervera's Spanish squadron and found it in the port of Santiago. The battleship was part of the blockade fleet until 3 July, but missed the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> steamed to Guantánamo Bay the night before to resupply coal. The next day, the battleship came back to Santiago, where she and Texas fired at the Spanish cruiser Reina Mercedes, which was being scuttled by the Spanish in a failed attempt to block the harbor entrance channel.|$|E
5|$|L. D. {{had shot}} and killed Okemah's deputy sheriff, George Loney, on May 2, 1911, while Loney and a posse were searching the Nelsons' farm for a stolen cow. L. D. and Laura were both charged with murder, in Laura's case <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{been the first to}} grab the gun. Her husband, Austin, pleaded guilty to larceny and was sent to the {{relative}} safety of the state prison in McAlester. Laura and L.D. were held in the Okemah county jail, possibly along with Laura's baby, to await trial.|$|E
5|$|On November 6, 1996 CMLL {{took the}} CMLL World Women's Championship away from then reigning {{champion}} Reina Jubuki <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> wrestled on a World Championship Wrestling (WCW) show in North America {{only a few}} days prior. At the time WCW had a working relationship with Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA), CMLL's main rival in Mexico and thus appearing for WCW was enough for CMLL to sever ties with Jubuki. CMLL held a tournament to crown a new champion only 2 days after announcing the title being vacated, choosing four of their top female competitors for a quick four-woman tournament.|$|E

Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart.|$|E

Emily Shelby is averse to this idea <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to see Tom go because he sees the man as his friend and mentor.|$|E
5|$|The role of Rachel was {{originally}} offered to actresses Téa Leoni, the producer's first choice, and Courteney Cox, {{both of whom}} declined, Leoni in favor of starring in the sitcom The Naked Truth, and Cox in favor of playing Rachel's best friend Monica in Friends. A virtually unknown actress at the time who had previously starred in five short-lived sitcoms, Aniston auditioned {{for the role of}} Rachel after turning down an offer as a cast member on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. After acquiring the role and before Friends aired, Aniston was temporarily at risk of being recast <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> also been involved with another sitcom, Muddling Through, at the time, which was ultimately canceled and allowed Aniston to remain on Friends.|$|E
