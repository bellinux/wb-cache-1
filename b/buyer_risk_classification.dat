40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a number of}} novel perspectives on <b>risk</b> <b>classification,</b> primarily {{in the context of}} life and critical illness insurance. I suggest that the terminology of "adverse selection" is often misleading, because from a public policy viewpoint, adverse selection may not always be adverse. I suggest that public policymakers should consider the criterion of "loss coverage", and that in many markets a socially optimal level of adverse selection is that which maximises loss coverage. A review of empirical studies suggests that adverse selection is often difficult to observe in practice; this leads to the concept of propitious selection, and various psychological perspectives on <b>risk</b> <b>classification.</b> I suggest that competition between insurers in <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> can sometimes be characterised as a malevolent invisible hand, and that public policy should direct competition towards areas that are more clearly beneficial to all insurance customers.

It {{can be traced back}} to the 1950 s 1 and received broad economic attention in the 1980 s when spiralling car insurance premiums in the U.

40|$|The {{problems}} of <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> are of high {{importance in the}} current period of improvement of the system analysis methods for decision making in poorly structured and formalized problems in the complex systems of different nature. The paper considers the problem of developing a formalized and comprehensive description of risks in complex systems of different nature, particularly in engineering systems. Background is caused by the inability of modern approaches to consider risks complexly, compare different risks with each other, analyze the interdependence of risks and identify cascade effects etc. The proposed concept of <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> is based on the formalized description of the risk. This approach allows the automating the process of <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> on the basis of new data during the system running. Analytical <b>classification</b> of the <b>risk</b> is shown with the resource-based clustering of system resources that are at risk of loss. Clustering of the resources is performed on the closeness of values of the total cost of the system resources that are expressed in a single measure of resources. Analyzed risks are classified and combined into one group, if they affect the resources that make up a single group (cluster). Analytical <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> takes into account and complexly considers all risks of the system, allows predicting and controlling not only the individual risks but the whole risk clusters of the system. In addition, proposed approach enables to build the structure of <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> for a particular problem, gives possibility to move from a verbal classification toward formalized one and ensures greater sustainability for risk management system. This concept of <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> minimizes costs for risk management and the losses from negative effects for the entire system in general. The future research should be focused on the developing the approaches to <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> on several parameters simultaneously. ?????? ????????? ???????????? ???????????? ?????? ????????????? ?????? ? ??????? ???????? ????????? ???????, ? ?????????, ? ???????????. ???????????? ???????? ??????????? ?????????????? ???????????? ???????? ?????????? ????????? ?????, ????????????? ?? ????????????????? ? ????????? ???????. ?????????? ????????? ????????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ?? ??????????? ????????. ??????????? ????????????? ????????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ????????????? ???????? ???????, ?????????????? ????? ??????. ???????????? ????????????? ????????? ???????????????? ????????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ????? ??????, ?????????????? ? ????????? ?? ?????????? ???????, ? ?????? ????????

40|$|<b>Risk</b> <b>classification</b> {{is a major}} {{technical}} challenge in medical diagnosis and chronic illness management. Various computational techniques {{have been developed for}} <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> in recent years with improvements in outcomes. This thesis investigates a novel approach combining support vector machine (SVM) and fuzzy modelling. The proposed hybrid model (called SVM-Fuzzy) is designed, implemented and evaluated on an available benchmark dataset. Diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus (also known as type 2 diabetes) are the motivating problem for the current investigation of <b>risk</b> <b>classification.</b> Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition marked by elevated levels of blood glucose. The prevalence of diabetes is increasing at a fast pace due to obesity, in particular, central obesity, physical inactivity, and unhealthy dietary habits. In type 2 diabetes patients, a range of different organs are under stress and are influenced by the altered metabolic condition. Hence the ailment has to be properly managed within stipulated boundaries to minimize other health complications caused by type 2 diabetes and to assure longevity of life. In the proposed model, fuzzy reasoning is used to classify the level of risks from data. SVM is used to design the fuzzy rules. The well-known Pima Indian diabetes dataset (Frank, 2010) is used to train the SVM and for testing the fuzzy system. The goal is to evaluate the proposed design for better accuracy in <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> and to investigate training the machine learning algorithm using sample real world data. Another goal is also to investigate efficiency in classification by optimizing selection of right sized datasets through appropriate dataset size selection from experiments. The experiments from the SVM-Fuzzy model show promising results on the benchmark Pima Indian diabetes dataset. Early in the thesis the various soft computing approaches, such as artificial neural network, SVM, Bayesian network and fuzzy logic models which have been previously reported as relevant to diabetes <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> are reviewed. The drawbacks in these models are analyzed and identified gaps from the previous computational models on <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> are targeted in the research questions. The main objective in <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> is to handle uncertain and incomplete input data for <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> and to make use of sample datasets using fuzzy reasoning. The experimental results from the proposed model (SVM-Fuzzy) from the type 2 diabetes <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> problem demonstrates that it is able to handle uncertain input data by making use of sample datasets for fuzzy reasoning. The outcomes from the proposed model on type 2 diabetes <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> are summarized and compared with the previous computational models. These experimental results are encouraging. The SVM-Fuzzy model can be further extended to manage type 2 diabetes risks using its output risk values in planning lifestyle and diet for responsive management of type 2 diabetes conditions. The model can further be extended to a multi-agent learning and planning environment for solving classification problems in complex applications, such as extracting patterns in structure of proteins in bioinformatics...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the predictive validity of a structured clinical judgement instrument - the Check List of Child Safety (CLCS) - that is widely used in the Netherlands. The second aim was to examine the predictive validity of a newly developed actuarial <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> that is based on variables measured with the CLCS. Method The sample consisted of 3963 Dutch families who were under the supervision of the Dutch Child Welfare Agency (CWA) between 2011 and 2013 because of problematic child-rearing situations. Relapse was defined as restarting treatment by the CWA because of newly substantiated problematic child-rearing situations. The actuarial <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> was developed by means of a CHAID analysis. The predictive validity of the CLCS and the actuarial <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> were examined by calculating several performance indicators (sensitivity, specificity, false positives, false negatives and AUC values). Results The predictive validity of the CLCS was poor, with a non-significant AUC of. 530, meaning that the CLCS performed no better than chance. The predictive validity of the actuarial <b>risk</b> <b>classification</b> was moderate, with a significant AUC of. 630.
