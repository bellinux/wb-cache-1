5|$|The format {{remained}} largely unchanged from previous series. Housemates were incarcerated in the <b>Big</b> <b>Brother</b> House with no contact {{to and from}} the outside world. Each week, the housemates took part in a compulsory task that determined the amount of money they were allocated to spend on their shopping; if they passed, they received a luxury budget and they were allocated a basic budget if they failed. Housemates were instructed to nominate two fellow housemates for eviction each week. This compulsory vote was conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room and housemates were not allowed to discuss the nomination process or influence the nominations of others. On Day 68, <b>Big</b> <b>Brother</b> changed the rules to allow housemates to discuss nominations until further notice. The two or more housemates who gathered the most nominations per week faced a public vote and the housemate receiving the most votes was evicted from the House on the Friday and interviewed by Davina McCall. Housemates could voluntarily leave the House at any time and those who broke the rules could have been ejected by <b>Big</b> <b>Brother.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{programme}} included 22 participants, four of whom {{left the}} programme voluntarily whilst {{the fate of}} the others was decided by the public vote.

The series, which was sponsored by Lucozade, achieved significantly less media coverage and viewing figures, resulting in it becoming the least-watched series in <b>Big</b> <b>Brother</b> UK history until <b>Big</b> <b>Brother</b> 12 in 2011. This series also attracted controversy, with accusations of bullying between contestants drawing complaints and criticisms levelled at the welfare of housemates after they left the programme.|$|E
