5|$|The chariots {{themselves}} were modified war chariots, essentially wooden carts with two wheels {{and an open}} back, although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle. The charioteer's feet were held in place, but the cart rested on the axle, so the ride was bumpy. The most exciting part of the chariot race, {{at least for the}} spectators, was the turns at the ends of the hippodrome. These turns were very dangerous and often deadly. If a chariot had not already been knocked over by an opponent before the turn, it might be overturned or crushed (along with the horses and driver) by the other chariots as they went around the post. Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him to crash was technically illegal, but nothing could <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> (at Patroclus' funeral games, Antilochus in fact causes Menelaus to crash in this way,) and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway.|$|E

She had {{multiple}} health problems. She was diagnosed with tuberculosis of the bone in her left arm when she was a child; this was before the discovery of antibiotics and apparently little could <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> She was treated by Sir Frederick Treves and said she had had so many operations, she had no memory of her life before the age of seven.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} bombers {{had a slight}} {{performance}} advantage over fighters due to having multiple engines and streamlined, but heavy, cantilever wing designs, so a successful interception would require careful planning to bring interceptor aircraft into a suitable defensive position {{in front of the}} bombers. Before World War II and the invention of radar, detection systems were visual or auditory, which gave only a few minutes' warning. Against World War I designs these systems were marginally useful, but against 1930s aircraft flying at twice their speed or more, they did not provide enough time to arrange interception missions. This balance of force meant that bombs would be falling before the fighters were in position and there was little that could <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> For Britain, the answer was to concentrate on bomber production, primarily as a deterrent force.|$|E

25|$|In 1995 {{the first}} Faroese patient with {{systemic}} primary carnitine deficiency (SPCD) was diagnosed. Later other patients were found, {{but nothing was}} done {{to find out if}} the illness was common or if something should <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Not until 2008 when a young woman died just a few days after being diagnosed with SPCD (in the Faroes, the illness is named CTD), actions were finally taken by the Faroese health authorities. The young woman had not been treated, and this caused a big discussion about how to prevent this from happening again. Shortly after, all Faroese people in the Faroes were invited to take a blood sample for a small cost and get it screened for SPCD. Several persons with the illness were found and got treatment immediately. It is now known that several Faroese people have died a sudden death at a young age because of this illness. Around one third of the Faroese population has been screened for SPCD (with a blood sample), and scientists think that at least one of every 1000 inhabitants of the Faroes have the illness. There have also been found elderly people who have survived the illness without treatment. The treatment is to give the patients carnitine supplement. The German physician and scientist Ulrike Steurwald, who has done research in the Faroe Islands for several years, has argued that the Faroese diet of red meat, like sheep meat and whale meat which contain high amounts of carnitine, may have protected many Faroese people from a sudden death at a young age from SPCD. The whale meat contains nutritions like carnitine, taurine and selenium. The concentration of selenium in raw fresh cod fillet and raw fresh pilot whale meat is 28µg/100g and 185µg/100g. The whale's blubber is rich in vitamin D, which around half of the elderly population and many amongst the younger generations in the Faroe Islands are lacking. Reasons for this can be changes from traditional food to pizza, chicken, etc. The fat of sea mammals provide excellent sources of vitamins A, D and E.|$|E

Doggett contacts an old military partner, Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin) to find Duffy's real identity. Although Rohrer assures Doggett he will investigate, the agent is not convinced, believing that Duffy is a CIA agent. He confides this to Skinner, who tells him to aid Scully at the military hospital. As Scully and Hendershot sneak out of the building, they are found by Rohrer and several marines, claiming Doggett has sent them to rescue her. Scully and Hendershot are driven away, but Hendershot enters labour. The women are separated, and Scully is drugged. When she wakens, Doggett informs her that Hendershot's baby was delivered and is normal. However, Scully is convinced something is amiss, but nothing more can <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> In another flashback, Scully tells Mulder that her attempt at in vitro fertilization has failed, but he tells her to [...] "never give up on a miracle".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), the deputy {{director}} of the Department of Parks and Recreation with six years of experience in the town of Pawnee, Indiana, discussing with a documentary crew her strong belief in the power of government to help other people. Later, Leslie hosts a community outreach public forum at an elementary school along with her jaded colleague Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari). Leslie is enthusiastic despite the low turnout and angry complaints, which she describes as [...] "people caring loudly at me". Local nurse Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones) complains about a giant pit near her house, which was dug out by a condominium developer that went bankrupt {{in the middle of the}} construction project. Ann says that her boyfriend Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) broke both his legs after falling into the pit, and she demands something <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Leslie is inspired by the challenge and makes a [...] "pinky promise" [...] that she will fill in the pit and build a park on the land.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} in Germany, Gerber learned about Magnus Hirschfeld and the work he and his Scientific-Humanitarian Committee were doing to reform anti-homosexual German law, {{especially}} Paragraph 175, which criminalized sex between men. Gerber traveled to Berlin, which supported a thriving gay subculture, on several occasions and subscribed {{to at least one}} homophile magazine. Gerber marveled at the development of the gay community in Berlin and later wrote [...] "I had always bitterly felt the injustice with which my own American society accused the homosexual of 'immoral acts.' What could <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> I thought. Unlike Germany, where the homosexual was partially organized and where sex legislation was uniform for the whole country, the United States was in a condition of chaos and misunderstanding concerning its sex laws, and no one was trying to unravel the tangle and bring relief to the abused." [...] He was particularly impressed with the work of a group called Bund für Menschenrechte (Association for Human Rights) and absorbed a number of Hirschfeld's ideas, including the notion that homosexual men were naturally effeminate. Following his military service, Gerber returned to the United States and {{went to work for the}} post office in Chicago.|$|E
