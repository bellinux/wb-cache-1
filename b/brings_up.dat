5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, deep vein thrombosis, and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also <b>brings</b> <b>up</b> the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{questions raised}} {{in this article}} are: {{what does it mean}} to <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> the topic of gender in a space where it is not known, and how can this moment of <b>bringing</b> <b>up</b> gender – or not <b>bringing</b> it <b>up</b> – be conceptualised? The article departs from the thoughts and questions that were provoked by an interview conducted with a Gender Studies student as part of a wider study; the personal experiences of the author and the theoretical interrogation of the issue of <b>bringing</b> <b>up</b> gender are also addressed as ‘data’. The approach that I develop builds on and troubles other Social Scientists’ uses of Julia Kristeva’s theorisation of abjection in Powers of Horror (1980), and constructs a notion of qualitative analysis that uses Kristeva’s conceptualisation of metaphor to relate theory to data. I attempt a use of the theory that accords with the textual representation of abjection in Powers of Horror. During the article, the notion of ‘bringing up gender’ evolves from a question of not knowing how to <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> gender, to not knowing how to <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> the never-knowable that is gender in the context of academic abjection. The aim of the article is to destabilise reflection on how gender ‘knowledge’ is – and can be – brought into relevance...|$|R
