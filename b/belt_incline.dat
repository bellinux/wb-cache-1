40|$|The {{efficiency}} of manure separation by {{a conveyor belt}} under a partially slatted floor for fattening pigs was determined for two types of belts, a flat <b>belt</b> with an <b>incline</b> of up to 6 ° transversely and a concave <b>belt</b> with an <b>incline</b> of up to 1 ° longitudinally.

In the model, flow conditions near the Sun are chosen {{to provide a}} reasonable match to the interplanetary configuration prevailing during the recent south polar passage by Ulysses, i. e., a streamer <b>belt</b> <b>inclined</b> approximately 30 deg to the solar equator and speeds ranging from 325 - 800 km/s. Field lines all across the stream pattern are traced from 1 to 10 AU by following the motion of marker particles embedded in the flow.

Thus, observations taken at a fixed latitude in the inner solar system sample, {{over the course of a}} solar rotation, field lines which connect to a range of latitudes in the outer heliosphere. Maps of the field line displacements are presented to help visualize these connections. In addition, it is found that depending upon the location relative to the CIR structure, the radial evolution of fluid elements frozen to different field lines can deviate considerably from that of the canonical solar wind. That is, for selected subsets of field lines, large speed changes (not just at shocks) can be experienced; the density variation can be far from 1 /r(exp 2), and the magnetic field intensity need not decay monotonically with distance...|$|R
40|$|A {{great many}} {{industrial}} processes involve interaction between solids and fluids (i. e. gases or liquids). Combustion, gasification of solid fuels, shales or solid wastes, drying of particles, calcining, particle heating, regenerative heat exchangers, oxidation or reduction of ores, metal surface treatments and catalytic and thermal cracking {{are some of}} such processes. Solids and fluids serve different roles and several combinations of solids and fluids can arise in a practical situation. Thus, when considering processes or plants {{it is necessary to}} be clear as to the particular purpose served by the fluids and the solids. Heating and drying of solids, for example, involve heat and mass transfer only, whereas combustors, gasifiers etc. have the additional complication of chemical reactions which have to be carried out simultaneously with heat and mass transfer. Again, there are many processes where just the flow of granular particles take place, for example, the flow of food grain, coal or sand particles through bin, silo, hoppers, chutes, conveyor <b>belts,</b> <b>inclined</b> planes etc. In most of these cases, a theoretical modeling of the process requires a complete and thorough understanding of the phenomena involved and constitutive modeling of the constituents along with the usual balance laws. In a process, where both a fluid and a solid constituents are involved, it is essential to model both the constituents such that the models accurately describes the characteristics of the constituent concerned.

5|$|To {{minimize}} the drawbacks of the <b>inclined</b> <b>belt,</b> it sloped {{outward from the}} keel, then back in towards the armored deck. This meant that shells fired at relatively close range would hit the upper portion of the belt at an angle, which maximized armor protection. However, {{the effectiveness of the}} upper portion of the belt was degraded at longer ranges, because plunging shells would strike it at an angle closer to the perpendicular, increasing their ability to penetrate the armor. It did reduce the area that needed to be covered by the armored deck, which saved additional weight. This enabled the upper belt to be thicker, which to an extent ameliorated the vulnerability to plunging fire. Because the belt was internal, it provided the opportunity to extend it to the inner portion of the double bottom, which gave the ship better underwater protection than the North Carolinas. Ultimately, the complex double <b>incline</b> <b>belt</b> armor was abandoned when it became apparent that a single slanted belt could provide similar protection, and save several hundred tons of weight.|$|R

The edge-on disk {{can be traced to}} about 0. 6 " or 65 AU projected separation. In its northern and southern wings, the disk shows at all wavelengths two prominent, bright and symmetrically placed knots at 0. 3 " or 32 AU from the star. We interpret these knots as a ring of planetesimals whose collisions may produce most of the dust observed in the disk. We find no evidence for a bow in the disk, but we identify a pair of symmetric, hook-like features in both wings. Based on similar features in the Beta Pictoris disk we propose that this wing-tilt asymmetry traces either an outer planetesimal <b>belt</b> that is <b>inclined</b> with respect to the disk midplane or radiation-pressure-driven dust blown out from a yet unseen, inner <b>belt</b> which is <b>inclined</b> with respect to the disk midplane.

40|$|Purpose. One of {{the main}} {{elements}} of the <b>inclined</b> <b>belt</b> bucket elevators is their drive. To determine the drive power, it is necessary to carry out calculations according to standard methods, which are described in the modern literature. The basic design parameters are the productivity, lifting height, type and properties of the transported material, the angle of inclination. It is necessary to build a parametric dependence of the driving power of the elevator on its design parameters, which takes into account the standard sizes and types of buckets and belts. Methodology. Using the methodology of traction calculation of <b>inclined</b> <b>belt</b> bucket elevator there were built parametric dependences of efforts in specific points of the route of the elevator, as well as the parametric dependences of the drive power of high-speed elevators with deep and shallow buckets on their design parameters and characteristics. Findings. On the basis of constructed parametric dependencies, {{it was found that the}} function of changing the value of the elevator’s power from design capacity (at fixed lifting height, type of cargo, belt speed) is piecewise constant and monotonically increasing. It was built a graphical representation of elevator drive power on the angle of its inclination within acceptable limits of change. The resulting relationship is non-linear and monotonically decreasing. In general terms the intervals of project performance values, which provide a constant value of drive power of inclined elevator were defined. As an example of the obtained results it was observed the process of dependence construction of the drive power on design capacity and inclination angle of the elevator for transporting the fine coal.

40|$|AbstractAs {{environmental}} regulations become more stringent, environmentally sound waste management and disposal practices are increasingly {{more important in}} all types of aquaculture. In many recirculation systems, microscreen filters are used to remove and concentrate the suspended solids from the process water, because they require minimal labor and floor space and can treat large flow rates of water with little head loss. These microscreen filters generate a separate solids waste stream that can be further concentrated to reduce the quantity and {{improve the quality of}} discharge water. A Belt Filter System, Hydrotech Model HBF 537 - 1 H, from Waste Management Technologies Inc., Baton Rouge, LA, USA was evaluated for rapid thickening of sludge from the backwash water of a microscreen filter. When used in conjunction with coagulation/flocculation aids, significant reduction of suspended solid and phosphorus are possible. Testing of the system was conducted using the backwash effluent of a microscreen filter that treated water discharged from several large-scale recirculating aquaculture production systems growing artic char and trout. The system was tested using only alum as the coagulant aid, using only a commercially available polymer as the flocculation aid and the two coagulation/flocculation aids in combination. Alum alone was moderately efficient in removing solids (82 %), but was very efficient in sequestering reactive phosphorus (96 %), with effluent concentrations less than 0. 07 mg/L-P at the highest alum dosage tested, 100 mg/L. Several commercially available polymers used alone and at relatively low dosages (15 mg/L) were very effective in removing suspended solids, with a removal rate averaging 96 % and with an effluent TSS concentration of less than 30 mg/L. The polymers were not as efficient as alum in removing reactive phosphorus, with a removal rate of approximately 40 %. At the optimum combined dosage of alum (mg/L) and polymer (mg/L), the <b>Inclined</b> <b>Belt</b> Filter System increased the dry matter content of the sludge to approximately 13 % solids, and reduced both the suspended solids and reactive phosphorus concentration of the effluent by 95 and 80 %, respectively. The combination of coagulation/flocculation aids and the <b>inclined</b> <b>belt</b> filter show excellent potential to greatly reduce the volume of solids generated, and significantly reduce the concentration of suspended solids and phosphorus in discharged effluents. By eliminating the need for settling tanks or ponds, the leaching of nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen) is minimized and the dewatered sludge is in a form for easy transport, storage, or disposal...|$|R
25|$|Belt press filters have 4 main zones: {{preconditioning}} zone, {{gravity drainage}} zone, linear compression (low-pressure) zone and roller compression (high-pressure) zone. Preconditioned slurry, which is flocculated and/or coagulated {{depending on the}} feed and process, is thickened in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone is a flat or <b>inclined</b> <b>belt</b> where gravity drainage of free water occurs The gravity drainage area is sized according to feed solid concentrations. The standard size {{can be used for}} solids concentrations of 1.5 percent or greater, but a setup with a longer drainage area or extended size should be used for 1.5 to 2.5 percent feed solids for more free water drainage before compression. For dilute sludge with feed solids of less than 1.5 percent, an independent gravity drainage belt can be used. This belt is used only in the gravity drainage area, not in the pressure zones. The pressure or wedge zones use two belts, upper and lower, to sandwich the feed together, but an independent gravity zone has its own separate belt, making the belt filter a three-belt system. Depending on the required conditions of the cake, belt filters can have added washing stages and, infrared, hot gas or even microwave drying stages.|$|R
40|$|Belt {{conveyors}} can {{be partially}} loaded {{due to the}} variation of bulk material flow loaded onto the conveyor. Speed control attempts to reduce the belt conveyor energy consumption and to enable the green operations of belt conveyors. Current research of speed control rarely takes the conveyor dynamics into account so that speed control lacks applicability. Based on our previous research, this paper will provide an improved three-step method to determine the minimum speed adjustment time. This method can be summarized as Estimation-Calculation-Optimization and ECO in short. The ECO method takes both the potential risks and the conveyor dynamics into account. It is expected to keep belt conveyors in good dynamic behaviors in transient operations. After discussing the ECO method, this research takes a long <b>inclined</b> <b>belt</b> conveyor of an import dry bulk terminal as case study. Based on the suggested acceleration time, a speed controller is built and computational simulations are carried out to evaluate the energy savings and the conveyor dynamics. Experimental results prove that {{the application of the}} ECO method ensures the healthy dynamic performance of belt conveyors under speed control in transient operations. Annually, the average electricity consumption of the single conveyor can be reduced by over 10 % with around 90 tons reduction of emission. The direct economic benefit can reach up to more than € 10, 000 in terms of the electricity utilization per year. Accepted Author ManuscriptTransport Engineering and Logistic...|$|R

One of the major challenges in this regard is to prepare the raw coffee fruits for sorting in one-by-one electronic machines. In this paper, we present a mechanical device developed to separate clusters and impurities from the main process. The mechanical device consists of two <b>inclined</b> <b>belt</b> conveyors with upward motion, working in series. This arrangement conveys upwards any elements with more than three contact points on the belt’s flat surface, while quasi-spherical elements (fruits) roll down on the belts. The experimental set up was designed to allow each belt’s inclination and speed to vary, in order to run a 3 x 3 factorial treatment design (Three inclinations: 10 º, 14 º and 18 º and three speeds: 0. 17, 0. 20 and 0. 24 m s- 1). The belt transport surface material was PVC. The best performance was obtained at the speed of 0. 20 m s- 1 and between 10 º and 14 º of inclination. After these findings, three treatments were conducted at a working speed of 0. 20 m s- 1 and three inclinations between 10 º and 14 º, finding the best performance at 11 º. In these conditions the mean efficacy of separation was 98. 8 %, varying within a range between 97. 5 % and 100 %.

40|$|From {{transportation}} of bulk materials in underground and open-cut mines to applications in power stations and processing plants to name but a few, belt conveyors {{are widely used}} as an economical continuous conveying method. Most of these industries rely strongly on conveyor transfers to divert material from one conveyor to another {{at some point in}} their system. The unfortunate reality is that some companies will be driven by cost minimisation for the short-term rather than planning for the long-term. This will result in bad decisions being made and the incorrect conveyor transfer being installed with flow-on effects such as downtime for modifications or even replacement. There are many facets to the design of a successful transfer chute including minimising product impact, degradation, chute wear, noise, dust and spillage while maximising the material velocity to allow the product to leave the chute at or near the speed of the receiving conveyor. Fully understanding the behaviour of a material is paramount to designing a successful transfer chute. Accurately determining the material discharge and trajectory from the head pulley is the first step in this design process. This paper will focus on the determination of the material trajectory as it leaves the belt conveyor head pulley. This process will also determine the point at which the material leaves the belt, referred to as the discharge angle. There are numerous methods available in the literature focusing on the modelling of material discharge and trajectory, including C. E. M. A. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], M. H. E. A.

40|$|Purpose. In {{the paper}} it is {{proposed}} to find methods of structural reinforcement of a side frame of a bogie {{in areas of}} stress concentration (the compound zone, {{the corners of the}} pedestal jaw opening, etc.), where, as the experience of operation shows, it is possible the emergence of fatigue cracks. It should avoid a significant increase in weight of the structure and does not cause «overflow» areas with a lot of stress from one portion of the structure to another. Methodology. The stresses in the side frame are determined by finite element modeling. Firstly parts of structure that is subject to be strengthened are detected. At the next stage the possible ways of enhancement are developed (wall thickness increase, change of fillet radii, introduction of additional truss plate, etc.). After which according to the results of simulation the effectiveness of each method is evaluated. Amplification of individual sections of the side frame does not always lead to its hardening as a whole (stress decrease in one place often leads to stress increase in the other one). The further procedure is iterative in nature: best-case changes are entered {{in the design of the}} frame; weakened areas of construction again are revealed and so on, till to the achievement an acceptable level of safety. Findings. Directional iterative search allows finding a combination of local amplification that increasing significantly the strength of structure. Namely, radius of the transition from the column to the support surface and in the openings between the column and the <b>inclined</b> <b>belt</b> up to 40 and 50 mm are increased respectively; truss plate are added between the upper and lower shelf of Triangel guide and on the inner guide of jaw aperture; technological area of the aperture in the column is reduced by one-third.
