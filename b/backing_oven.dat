The Akkadian administration had little effect on the local administrative traditions and sealing style, and Akkadian seals existed {{side by side with the}} local variant. The Hurrians employed the Akkadian style in their seals, and Elamite seals were discovered, indicating an interaction with the western Iranian Plateau. Tell Brak provided great knowledge on the culture of Mitanni, which produced glass using sophisticated techniques, that resulted in different varieties of multicolored and decorated shapes. Samples of the elaborate Nuzi ware were discovered, in addition to seals that combine distinctive Mitannian elements with the international motifs of that period.|$|E

40|$|The {{installed}} {{performance of}} cooking exhaust fans was evaluated through residential field experiments conducted on {{a sample of}} 15 devices varying in design and other characteristics. The sample included two rear downdraft systems, two under-cabinet microwave over range (MOR) units, three different installations of an under-cabinet model with grease screens across the bottom and no capture hood, two devices with grease screens covering {{the bottom of a}} large capture hood (one under-cabinet, one wall-mount chimney), four under-cabinet open hoods, and two open hoods with chimney mounts over islands. Performance assessment included measurement of airflow and sound levels across fan settings and experiments to quantify the contemporaneous capture efficiency for the exhaust generated by natural gas cooking burners. Capture efficiency is defined as the fraction of generated pollutants that are removed through the exhaust and thus not available for inhalation of household occupants. Capture efficiency (CE) was assessed for various configurations of burner use (e. g., single front, single back, combination of one front and one <b>back,</b> <b>oven)</b> and fan speed setting. Measured airflow rates were substantially lower than the levels noted in product literature for many of the units. This shortfall was observed for several units costing in excess of $ 1000. Capture efficiency varied widely (from < 5 percent to roughly 100 percent) across devices and across conditions for some devices. As expected, higher capture efficiencies were achieved with higher fan settings and the associated higher air flow rates. In most cases, capture efficiencies were substantially higher for rear burners than for front burners. The best and most consistent performance was observed for open hoods that covered all cooktop burners and operated at higher airflow rates. The lowest capture efficiencies were measured when a front burner was used with a rear backdraft system or with lowest fan setting for above the range systems that do not cover the front burners...|$|R

The Kohen is also required to recite the required Beracha thanking God for sanctifying the Kohanim with the sanctity of Ahron.|$|R
5000|$|The {{beehive oven}} {{typically}} took {{two to three}} hours to heat, occasionally even four hours in the winter. Breads were baked first when the beehive oven was hottest, with other baked items such as cinnamon buns, cakes, and pies. As the oven cooled, muffins and [...] "biscuits" [...] could be baked, along with puddings and custards. After a day's baking there was typically sufficient heat to dry apples and other fruits, vegetables, or herbs. Pots of beans were often placed in the <b>back</b> of the <b>oven</b> to cook slowly overnight.|$|R
50|$|Paximathia were {{traditionally}} {{consumed by}} Greek farmers, {{as well as}} the Byzantine military and thrifty priests. Greek farmers would eat paximathia in their fields after soaking it in water and olive oil, which would soften it. This was sometimes accompanied with foods such as homemade cheese and a few olives, often as sole accompaniments. It used to be baked in outdoor ovens approximately every ten to fifteen days, after which the bread would be sliced thickly into wedges and placed <b>back</b> in the <b>ovens</b> to dry, which would serve to preserve it. Paximadia was a staple food for the inhabitants of Crete.|$|R
500|$|A {{household}} {{demonstration of}} this technique is possible, using a microwave oven and food such as marshmallows or margarine: if the turntable is removed so that the food does not move, it will cook the fastest at the antinodes (the points at which the wave amplitude is the greatest), where it will begin to melt. The distance between two such spots is half the wavelength of the microwaves; by measuring this distance and multiplying the wavelength by the microwave frequency (usually displayed on the <b>back</b> of the <b>oven,</b> typically 2450MHz), the value of c can be calculated, [...] "often with less than 5% error".|$|R

Jerry carries the angry duckling into his mousehole to explain that Tom is not his mother, but Quacker stubbornly refuses to believe him, slamming the book shut onto Jerry before running away. When Tom notices Jerry chasing after Quacker, he traps the mouse in a jar, ties it shut with string and then throws it down a well. Still determined to eat Quacker, Tom then makes [...] "Stewed Duck".

5000|$|Choux {{begins as}} a mixture of milk or water and butter which are heated {{together}} until the butter melts, to which flour is added to form a dough. Eggs are then beaten into the dough to further enrich it. This high percentage of water causes the pastry to expand into a light, hollow pastry. Initially, {{the water in the}} dough turns to steam in the oven and causes the pastry to rise; then the starch in the flour gelatinizes, thereby solidifying the pastry. [...] Once the choux dough has expanded, it is taken out of the oven; a hole is made in it to let the steam out. The pastry is then placed <b>back</b> in the <b>oven</b> to dry out and become crisp. The pastry is filled with various flavors of cream and is often topped with chocolate. Choux pastries can also be filled with ingredients such as cheese, tuna, or chicken to be used as appetizers.|$|R
5000|$|Horno ( [...] ) is a mud adobe-built outdoor oven used by Native Americans {{and early}} {{settlers}} of North America. Originally {{introduced to the}} Iberian Peninsula by the Moors, it was quickly adopted and carried to all Spanish-occupied lands. The horno has a beehive shape and uses wood as the heat source. The procedure still used in parts of New Mexico and Arizona {{is to build a}} fire inside the horno and, when the proper amount of time has passed, remove the embers and ashes and insert the bread to be cooked. In the case of corn, the embers are doused with water and the corn is then inserted into the horno to be [...] "steam"-cooked. When cooking meats, the oven is fired to a [...] "white hot" [...] temperature (approximately 650 °F or 340 °C), the coals are moved to the <b>back</b> of the <b>oven,</b> and the meats placed inside. The smoke-hole and door are sealed with mud. A twenty-one-pound turkey will take 2½ to 3 hours to cook. [...] It comes out very succulent. Since the horno is made of adobe, it wicks the moisture into the food in a natural convection.|$|R

Much Sardinian bread is made dry, which keeps longer than high-moisture breads.Those are baked as well, including civraxiu, coccoi pintau, a highly decorative bread and pistoccu made with flour and water only, originally meant for herders, but often served {{at home with}} tomatoes, basil, oregano, garlic and a strong cheese. Traditional cheeses include pecorino sardo, pecorino romano, casizolu, ricotta and the casu marzu (notable for containing live insect larvae).One {{of the most famous}} of foods is pane carasau, the flat bread of Sardinia, famous for its thin crunchiness. Originally the making of this bread was a hard process which needed three women to do the job. This flat bread is always made by hand as it gives a different flavor the more you work the dough. After working the dough it will be rolled out in very thin circles and placed in an extremely hot stone oven where the dough will blow up into a ball shape. Once the dough achieves that state it is then removed from the oven where it is then cut into two thin sheets and stacked to go <b>back</b> into the <b>oven.</b>|$|R
50|$|On the {{occasion}} of Papa's birthday, Becky welcomes the boy for the party. Papa warns Becky that he doesn't want an Irishman for her. Trying to be helpful, the boy helps clean up by bringing food into the kitchen. Mama leaves for a minute while the boy opens the oven to see a cake which collapses because of the open oven door. Embarrassed, he shuts the door, only to have Mama return to warn him against opening the oven door because the cake might collapse. Concerned about the impression he'll make, he secretly removes the cake and takes it {{out the back door}} to think of what to do. Eyeing a bicycle pump, he uses it to return the cake to its air-filled state, and sneaks it <b>back</b> into the <b>oven</b> without Mama seeing. Everyone is seated for the presentation of Papa's cake. He begins to cut into it, but the nearby candles mysteriously blow out. After repeatedly trying to cut the cake only to have nearby objects flung from the force of air, Maxie reveals that the boy was responsible for making the cake full of air. Papa angrily throws him out of the house, but Becky follows, saying she's going to marry him. After a humorous pursuit down the streets of Los Angeles, Papa finally catches up as Becky and the boy enter his house. Inside the house Papa yells at the boy that his daughter is not going to marry an Irish boy. The boy then introduces his parents, clearly Orthodox Jews, leading to a happy ending. The film fades as Papa chases Maxie for playing a prank on him.|$|R
40|$|Piston’s {{rings are}} one of the most {{critical}} parts of heavy-duty engines for wear-work in conditions of prolonged exposure of alternating loads and high temperatures. Currently in the world production of billets for piston’s rings is dominated by the two methods of casting: production of individual and oiling billets of gray and ductile cast iron in green-sand mold and shell mold and centrifugal casting method (intended primarily for oiling billets of ductile iron); the technology for individual production billets for piston’s rings with a diameter up to 250 mm, from 250 to 450 mm with individual and oiling ways, over 450 mm - preference of oiling billet. The best parameters of physical-mechanical and operational characteristics piston’s rings are in the case of manufacture of billets to the maximum extent approaching the configuration to the finished product. The rings made of shaped billets are characterized by uniform distribution of properties from the perimeter, provide a given diagram of pressures and full fit to the cylinder. Because of deficiencies of traditional methods of casting, continuous quality requirements for billets, the need for economy of material, fuel and energy resources, are finding new progressive technological processes of production of high-quality billets for piston’s rings. One of the most promising for piston rings billet is a method of casting consists of immersing the sand molds into the melt. It is interesting idea, expressed by A. Sutherland and subsequently patented in several countries in the way of casting method, called "immersion pouring technology" (ICT-Immersion Casting Technique) [1]. Experiments, conducted in the laboratory of the Belarusian National Technical University, have identified significant shortcomings of immersion method of casting. When forms are immersing, have an intensive gassing in molten metal, and freezing of the metal on the out surface of the form. But despite some shortcomings, the proposed process is characterized by a significant reduction of laboriousness, improved working conditions, a significant decreasing of molding materials, decreasing of production areas, complete except flasks and ladles. In the Belarusian National Technical University was developed an improved method of casting immersion [2], schematic diagram of the process was shown in Figure 1. Thin ring single mould (5 - 10 mm), core sand - made, collect by means of a special device to the blocks. Pouring and filling billets are being when preheated moulds immersing in melt metal through one or more gatings, leaving the outer surface of the mould. Filling billet is directly from the molten pool until its complete solidification, after finishing of billet’s crystallization, non - solidified metal from the gatings goes <b>back</b> into the <b>oven.</b> For a long time, based on experimental investigation are identified optimal technological parameters of the process of casting billets of low-alloyed gray and ductile iron. Through the minimum time between the modification and pouring moulds of melt, graphitized items, in ligatures, have the greatest effect. Crystallization of the alloy is mainly running with the formation of austenite-graphite eutectic, which also has a positive effect on reducing marriage to porosity. Due to the active influence on the rate of solidification and cooling at different periods of the formation of the casting, provides technological process provide to obtaining billets without structurally - free carbides with the requisite level of physical and mechanical properties without the using of energy-intensive heat treatment. Optimal thermal conditions for the formation provide uniformity of hardness on the perimeter of billet. Physical-mechanical properties and microstructure satisfy the technical requirements for piston’s rings. Possibility to obtain a single cast billets of ductile iron with hypoeutectic composition, free shrinkage defects. Significantly reduces the deadweight loss of the metal, because there is no need to use big quantity of waste of production, accounting more than 50 % with the traditional casting technology. Replacing the traditional casting technology of individual billets of piston’s rings in the green-sand moulds with casting by immersion, allows high-performance process, increase the yield of up to 85 - 95 %, make technological process simplified and cheaper...|$|R
