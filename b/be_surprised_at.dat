25|$|Surely Bentley {{was right}} to <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> finding Faunus {{haunting}} the bower , a ghost crying in the cold of Paradise, and the lusts of Pan sacred even in comparison to Eden. There is a Vergilian quality in the lines, haunting indeed, a pathos not mentioned {{because it is the}} whole of the story. I suppose that in Satan determining to destroy the innocent happiness of Eden, for the highest political motives, without hatred, not without tears, we may find some echo of the Elizabethan fulness of life that Milton as a poet abandoned, and as a Puritan helped to destroy.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the actors}} {{went before the}} cameras each day, the pliable pieces were applied {{directly}} to their faces to recreate Seiderman's sculptural image. Welles was allergic to Max Factor's gum, so Seiderman invented an alternative that also photographed more realistically. The facial surface was underpainted in a flexible red plastic compound; Cotten recalled being instructed to puff out his cheeks during this process. Later, seeing the results in the mirror, Cotten told Seiderman, [...] "I am acting {{the part of a}} nice old gentleman, not a relief map of the Rocky Mountains." [...] Seiderman replied, [...] "You'd <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> what the camera doesn't see unless we place it within its view. How about some more coffee?" ...|$|E
500|$|Although the C5 reached {{retail stores}} {{at the start}} of March 1985, sales had tailed off. Sinclair resorted to hiring teams of {{teenagers}} to drive around London in C5s to promote the vehicle, at a cost to the company of £20 a day. Similar teams were established in Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds. The company denied that it was a marketing campaign; a spokesman told The Times that [...] "we haven't done... tests on inner city roads. That is what the team is doing. Marketing is not the prime function but will undoubtedly be a spin-off." [...] Sinclair was reported to <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> the lack of demand and blamed the press for [...] "a lack of foresight and pessimistic reporting". Matters did not improve. The retail chain Comet acquired 1,600 C5s but nine months later most were still unsold.|$|E

500|$|... 'I {{wrote it}} because it was {{necessary}} for me to write it,' Mariah said of her most personal, and angriest, song to date. Fans might <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> her references to 'the hell that we built' and the 'violent times,' but Mariah thinks this song is for 'anyone who’s been in an abusive relationship.' 'You know what? I’ve been through too much at this point,' she said. 'I want happiness and I want pure and real love, but the side effects of what other relationships have put me through cause me to be kind of on the defensive a lot of the time. And if somebody isn’t mature or caring and loving and open-hearted enough to understand that, then it’s tough, but this is a song for people who need that.' Mariah hopes that this song helps people feel 'a little bit stronger.' ...|$|E
500|$|Due to his immense {{popularity}} {{during his}} lifetime, Holmes was {{often called upon}} to produce commemorative poetry for specific occasions, including memorials, anniversaries and birthdays. Referring to this demand for his attention, he once wrote that he was [...] "a florist in verse, and what would people say / If I came to a banquet without my bouquet?" [...] As critic Hyatt Waggoner noted, however, [...] "very little... survives the occasions that produced it". Holmes became known as a poet who expressed the benefits of loyalty and trust at serious gatherings, as well as one who showed wit at festivities and celebrations. Edwin Percy Whipple for one considered Holmes to be [...] "a poet of sentiment and passion. Those who know him only as a comic lyricist, as the libellous laureate of chirping follow and presumptuous egotism, would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> the clear sweetness and skylark thrill of his serious and sentimental compositions".|$|E
500|$|CDs were {{submitted}} to Weiland containing music in completed demo form, including scratch melodies, which Weiland {{had the option}} to use or discard. Dean did not mind when his melodies were not accepted by Weiland. [...] "hen I write a song, I know what I {{want it to be}} melodically. But Scott always... knocks my melodies out of the water." [...] Weiland worked on the lyrics using these demo arrangements, often making suggestions for musical phrases to be doubled or moved. Weiland was credited for the lyrical melodies, but Robert pointed out, [...] "This record was made in a way that Scott wasn't really there for the creation of these songs, musically." [...] However, both Dean and Robert would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> the direction Weiland would take the songs, which could have been composed with an entirely different vision. Robert found this to be a strength within the band. [...] "People always have this misconception that a band all need to think alike... so many different ways of looking at songs and [...] put together, and that's really the beauty of a great band".|$|E

500|$|Recovered, the nonagenarian Meeker {{began making}} fresh travel plans. [...] With the International Air Races {{to be held}} at Dayton, Ohio, in 1924, Meeker tried to get the War Department to allow him to fly there. [...] He was successful, and flew with the Army pilot, Oakley G. Kelly. [...] At a stop in Boise, Meeker quipped they were making better time than with his ox team, and in Dayton met {{aviation}} pioneer Orville Wright, to whom he commented, [...] "You'd <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> the difference between riding in a Prairie Schooner and in an airplane." [...] The publicity was so favorable that the Army had Kelly fly Meeker {{the rest of the way}} to Washington, D.C., where the onetime pioneer met President Calvin Coolidge in October 1924. [...] Meeker returned to Seattle by train. Wanting the government to build a road over Naches Pass, where he had guided his father's party seventy years before, Meeker ran for the Washington House of Representatives in 1924 from the 47th district but was defeated in the Republican primary by 35 votes. In 1925, Meeker drove an ox team for several months while touring in J.C. Miller's Wild West Show.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} {{and success of}} the lead single [...] "Bad Boys" [...] from her debut album Overcome in October 2009, the singer {{released}} [...] "Broken Heels" [...] as the second single in January 2010, {{with the intention of}} releasing [...] "The Silence" [...] as the album's third single. However, a remix single version of [...] "All Night Long" [...] featuring Pitbull was released as the third single from the album instead in May 2010. On 25 October 2010, Burke announced via Twitter that [...] "The Silence" [...] would be the final song to be released from Overcome, writing [...] "Some of you might <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> my choice of next single and some of you guys will hopefully be really happy." [...] The song was re-recorded with a new vocal for inclusion on the re-release of the album, entitled [...] "The Silence (New Single Mix)". In an interview with Eamonn Holmes for Sky News Sunrise in December 2010, Burke stated that [...] "The Silence" [...] was released as a promotional single for the re-release of Overcome and for Christmas. During an interview talking about the song for Virgin Media in December 2010, Burke stated that [...] "The Silence" [...] is a [...] "very special song" [...] and that despite it being a [...] "very emotional song to sing", it is one of her most favourite songs on Overcome.|$|E
2500|$|We {{should not}} <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> {{the lack of}} ruins in America in general. Actually the {{scarcity}} of identifiable remains in the Old World is even more impressive. In view {{of the nature of}} their civilization one should not be puzzled if the Nephites had left us no ruins at all. People underestimate the capacity of things to disappear, and do not realize that the ancients almost never built of stone. Many a great civilization which has left a notable mark in history and literature has left behind not a single recognizable trace of itself. We must stop looking for the wrong things.|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Masters {{described}} her fiction: [...] "All my writing is about human behaviour. There's not much drama, no great happenings in it. No violence. It's about the violence that's inside the human heart, I think, {{more than anything}} else". In the same interview she also credits her journalistic career for helping her creative writing: [...] "you would sometimes take quite an ordinary and humble person and write a story about them, and you'd <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> the quality that there was in the ordinary human being ... I {{learned a lot about}} human nature, and human behaviour, as a journalist ... there is more in life, more in situations, than meets the eye".|$|E
2500|$|I {{realize that}} I shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> God's {{doing things that}} I can't explain. [...] I shouldn't doubt His {{existence}} just because I find that I sometimes can't understand why or how He has made something. [...] I know that my nature is weak and limited and that God's is limitless, incomprehensible, and infinite, and, from this, I can infer that He can do innumerable things whose reasons are unknown to me. [...] On this ground alone, I regard the common practice of explaining things {{in terms of their}} purposes to be useless in physics: it would be foolhardy of me to think that I can discover God's purposes.

2500|$|By 1953, McGuirk was {{the primary}} booker for the junior heavyweight champion, while {{coordinating}} talent from southwestern Missouri to Little Rock, across Oklahoma, and into parts of Texas. Despite being the booker, McGuirk also took on the opportunity to train promising wrestlers. One of his most promising was eventual NWA World Heavyweight Champion Dick Hutton. In the May 10, 1953 edition of the Tulsa Daily World, McGuirk said [...] "He has a fine chance {{to get into the}} big money brackets. He has a lot to learn, but has the natural qualifications, and I won’t <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> anything he may accomplish." [...] Hutton did not disappoint, as he beat Lou Thesz on November 14, 1957 at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto.|$|E

2500|$|The Washington Post {{published}} {{a series of}} articles beginning February 18, 2007, outlining cases of neglect at Walter Reed reported by wounded soldiers and their family members. Although the article focused primarily on Building 18, a former hotel just outside the post's main gates, authors Dana Priest and Anne Hull also included complaints about [...] "disengaged clerks, unqualified platoon sergeants and overworked managers" [...] that make navigating the already complicated bureaucracy to obtain medical care at WRAMC even more daunting. Although army officials claimed to <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> these conditions, a Salon.com series beginning in January 2005 had previously exposed them. In 2004 and 2005, articles appeared in the Post and in Salon interviewing First Lieutenant Julian Goodrum about his court martial for seeking medical care elsewhere due to poor conditions at WRAMC.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Knight reprised {{the role}} of Ruth in Pirates with the Lyric Opera of Chicago. [...] Chicago radio host Bruce Duffie, {{interviewing}} Knight after seeing that production noted, [...] "Gillian Knight {{is one of those}} great personalities who simply go about their business season after season, giving splendid renditions of various roles, and adding luster to their home companies while not going far afield very often and, thus, passing up the opportunity for real world-wide stardom". During that interview, Knight said, [...] "I'm getting a bit controversial here, but there is a snobbish attitude towards Gilbert and Sullivan in the opera world.... I believe in excellence. [...] Now I believe that if Gilbert and Sullivan is done well... then it is excellent, and it should be in a [...] house". [...] She advised audiences, [...] "Don't close your mind to anything because somebody has said, 'Oh, this is Gilbert and Sullivan,' or, 'This is modern music.' [...] Just keep an open mind and you may <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> how much you get out of it".|$|E
2500|$|Of {{filming the}} moment in which Rebecca pushes Paul, Hall said [...] "The way Stefan Dennis (who plays Paul) and I {{interpreted}} it and acted it was we had to satisfy ourselves {{that it was one}} of those random and instantaneous mistakes people make. When we worked on the scene we had to make it look like she had a moment of fury that caused her to do that." [...] Hall knew that viewers would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> Rebecca being the culprit and she herself was surprised by the fan's reactions. Some women questioned how Rebecca could do such a thing to Paul, even though he cheated on her and lied to her. Hall thought that someone could get [...] "so fed up" [...] that they made a rash decision that is not something they thought they could ever do. In September 2010, Rebecca's confession and explanation for the night she pushed Paul was broadcast. The episode initially saw Declan Napier (Erin Mullally) admit to Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) that he was responsible to protect his mother. Hall added that [...] "the ramifications of Rebecca pushing Paul over the mezzanine are far-reaching".|$|E

2500|$|Tim Sendra of AllMusic {{he stated}} [...] "All Time Low {{shows signs of}} maturing," [...] he {{summarized}} by adding, [...] "Nothing Personal {{is an example of}} emo-pop at its best, and anyone who thinks emo is just a bunch of pop junk might <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> how catchy and powerful a modern rock album it is." [...] Kerrang! writer Nick Ruskell praised lead single, [...] "Weightless", as [...] "a three minute rush of punk smothered in pop fairy dust". He went on to add that, [...] "Nothing Personal is simply a good, fun record." [...] Rock Sound stated the band had [...] "nailed it with their third offering". The review went on to say, [...] "Lead single 'Weightless' kicks things off in cracking fashion with its epic sing-along chorus, and the momentum continues well into the rest of the album. Matt Squire (Panic! at the Disco) returns with his trademark production polish". Courtney Lear of online music site ShockHound, also praised the album, commenting that it had [...] "massive hooks and memorable choruses, with frontman Alex Gaskarth singing songs about cross-country partying, drinking too much, and hooking up. Who needs classy guys? Rebel against your parents, girls." ...|$|E
2500|$|Austin Nichols portrays Julian Baker, Peyton's ex-boyfriend from Los Angeles. [...] "The {{funny thing}} about Austin {{is that there was}} {{initially}} much resistance from the folks who have to OK our casting choices. Which is not rare, by the way," [...] commented Schwahn. [...] "When that happens, I {{pick up the phone and}} try to rationalize with everyone, or pout or bitch or whine and eventually I get my way (and probably get called an ass****) and this leads to Austin Nichols killing it as Julian, just as I suspected he would in the first place." [...] Schwahn added, [...] "This is not to say that there aren't good people and good allies working on my show at both the studio and network, just that the fans would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> how things work behind the scenes." [...] A regular from season 7, Julian initially comes to Tree Hill to win Peyton back. He offers to produce a film based on Lucas's first book. At first, Peyton does not reveal to Lucas that Julian is her ex-boyfriend, but she is forced to do so when the plans of the movie take shape. Brooke rebuffs his advances until Peyton gives her blessing when she sees that Brooke has a serious interest in Julian. After Brooke opens up to Julian, they begin a relationship.|$|E
2500|$|Writer David Malitz of The Washington Post {{felt that}} the album [...] "is overstuffed with high-wattage cameos." [...] adding that [...] "Game {{surrounds}} himself with these stars, regularly gets out-rapped by them and proceeds to thrust his chest out and proclaim his superiority." [...] Los Angeles Times writer Mikael Wood commented that [...] "In stark contrast with such charm merchants as Jay-Z and Lil Wayne, Game’s low likability is no impediment to his art; indeed, The R.E.D. Album, his fourth studio set, succeeds not {{in spite of his}} character [...] flaws but because of them." [...] Carl Chery of XXL gave the album a rating of [...] "L" [...] and noted [...] "Game’s flows and lyrical skills are still sharp, but his narrative hasn’t changed much through the course of four albums". Despite that [...] "one shouldn’t be surprised," [...] David Amidon of PopMatters wrote [...] "A lot of what initially made Game an intriguing artist is missing from this release, replaced instead by fleeting moments of great music and extended periods of mediocrity or whackness." [...] and added that [...] "neither should one <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> the schizophrenic nature that pervades much of the album." [...] Pitchfork Media's Jordan Sargent commented that the albums [...] "unsightly storm of star power is the backbone [...] of what could've been a coherent album." [...] Arwa Haider of Metro viewed it as a [...] "cinematic drama of the rapper's Westside life experience, which could easily have become schmaltzy but is fuelled by his rugged wordplay and guests on sharp form." ...|$|E
