5|$|Greater {{problems}} arose over financial {{speculation and}} {{the management of the}} national debt. Certain government bonds could not be redeemed without the consent of the <b>bondholder</b> and had been issued when interest rates were high; consequently each bond represented a long-term drain on public finances, as bonds were hardly ever redeemed. In 1719 the South Sea Company proposed to take over £31million (three fifths) of the British national debt by exchanging government securities for stock in the company. The Company bribed Lord Sunderland, George's mistress Melusine von der Schulenburg, and Lord Stanhope's cousin, Charles Stanhope, who was Secretary of the Treasury, to support their plan. The Company enticed bondholders to convert their high-interest, irredeemable bonds to low-interest, easily tradeable stocks by offering apparently preferential financial gains. Company prices rose rapidly; the shares had cost £128 on 1 January 1720, but were valued at £500 when the conversion scheme opened in May. On 24 June the price reached a peak of £1,050. The company's success led to the speculative flotation of other companies, some of a bogus nature, and the Government, in an attempt to suppress these schemes and {{with the support of the}} Company, passed the Bubble Act. With the rise in the market now halted, uncontrolled selling began in August, which caused the stock to plummet to £150 by the end of September. Many individuals—including aristocrats—lost vast sums and some were completely ruined. George, who had been in Hanover since June, returned to London in November—sooner than he wanted or was usual—at the request of the ministry.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{makes two}} {{arguments}} that, combined, demonstrate an important synergy: first, including <b>bondholders</b> in corporate governance could help to reduce systemic risk because <b>bondholders</b> are more risk averse than shareholders; second, corporate governance should include <b>bondholders</b> because bonds now dwarf equity {{as a source}} of corporate financing and bond prices are increasingly tied to firm performance...|$|R

25|$|There is no {{guarantee}} of how much money will remain to repay <b>bondholders.</b> As an example, after an accounting scandal and a Chapter 11 bankruptcy at the giant telecommunications company Worldcom, in 2004 its <b>bondholders</b> ended up being paid 35.7 cents on the dollar. In a bankruptcy involving reorganization or recapitalization, as opposed to liquidation, <b>bondholders</b> may end up having the value of their bonds reduced, often through an exchange for a smaller number of newly issued bonds.|$|R
50|$|Kicillof was {{a central}} figure in the 2014 dispute with holdout <b>bondholders,</b> {{particularly}} with NML Capital Limited, the Cayman Islands-based hedge fund demanding US$832 million for Argentine bonds purchased for US$49 million in the secondary market in 2008. Argentine debt restructuring initiated in 2005 had been accepted by over 92% of <b>bondholders,</b> and these bonds had been serviced on schedule since then. A 2014 ruling by a District Court Judge Thomas Griesa blocked bondholders' payments for New York-issued bonds. The ruling, which granted holdouts above-market demands, had the contractually-stipulated effect of stopping payments to <b>bondholders</b> until holdout demands were met and in turn led to demands from restructured <b>bondholders</b> (the 92%) that their payments be released.|$|R

25|$|On the March 30, 2009 {{deadline}} President Barack Obama {{declined to}} provide {{financial aid to}} General Motors, and requested that General Motors produce credible plans, saying that the company's proposals had avoided tough decisions, and that Chapter 11 bankruptcy appeared the most promising way to reduce its debts, by allowing the courts to compel bondholders and trade unions into settlements. GM Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner was also forced to resign. GM bondholders rejected the government's first offer, but the unions agreed to the preferential terms. A <b>bondholder</b> debt to equity counteroffer was ignored.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year in January, 1897 again in Baltimore, the railroad was reorganized into the Frederick and Northern Railroad Company. At that time, {{it was reported}} that the predecessor line was barely able to cover operating expenses and rarely turned a profit. It never earned the interest payable on its bonds, (Frederick city was the largest <b>bondholder)</b> and {{at the time of its}} foreclosure, the unpaid interest exceeded the principal. In March 1897, this new company was itself merged with other Pennsylvania-controlled railways (Littlestown Railroad Company and the Hanover and York Railroad Company) into the York, Hanover and Frederick Railroad Company, chartered under the general laws of Pennsylvania and Maryland.|$|E
25|$|In 1871, Virginia enacted {{legislation}} exchanging {{two-thirds of}} its outstanding bonds for new debt, and issuing certificates for the remaining one-third of the debt (which the state assumed would be paid by West Virginia) guaranteeing payment once the state's debt dispute with West Virginia was resolved. Virginia enacted legislation in 1879 reducing the interest rate on the outstanding one-third of the debt, {{but was unable to}} discharge the debt due to <b>bondholder</b> resistance. A second sale in 1882 also failed, and in 1892 Virginia issued new bonds to pay off the old one-third debt. Virginia established a commission in 1894 to negotiate with West Virginia over the debt, and in 1900 authorized the commission to accept the 1871 certificates from bondholders with the promise to pay once negotiations with West Virginia concluded.|$|E
40|$|We {{argue that}} {{executives}} can affect firm outcomes {{only if they}} have influence over crucial decisions. This study explores the impact of CEO power or CEO dominance on bond ratings and yield spreads. We find that credit ratings are lower and yield spreads higher for firms whose CEOs have more decision-making power. To further investigate why <b>bondholders</b> are concerned about CEO power, we show that powerful CEOs tend to maintain an opaque information environment. <b>Bondholders</b> demand higher yields because {{it is difficult for}} them to monitor managers in firms with powerful CEOs. Taken together, the results suggest that <b>bondholders</b> perceive CEO power as a critical determinant of the cost of bond financing.

5000|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Austro-Hungarian bank was put into liquidation. Rights of the <b>bondholders</b> where settled in 1939 extra-juridical settlement. Liquidators undertook to pay $210,000 to the <b>bondholders</b> out of monies then on deposit with the United States Treasury. Problem was that money was confiscated by the United States Government as enemy property during The First World War. Finally, the United States Office of Alien Property transferred a sum of just over $45,000 to the liquidators and authorized them to transfer it to the Austrian Government. Rest of the money was transferred to the governments of Italy and Yugoslavia.The plaintiff, representing the <b>bondholders</b> claimed that the Austrian Government would be unjustly enriched if it decides not to repay <b>bondholders.</b>|$|R

25|$|Fixed rate {{bonds are}} subject to {{interest}} rate risk, meaning that their market prices will decrease in value when the generally prevailing interest rates rise. Since the payments are fixed, {{a decrease in the}} market price of the bond means an increase in its yield. When the market interest rate rises, the market price of bonds will fall, reflecting investors' ability to get a higher interest rate on their money elsewhere — perhaps by purchasing a newly issued bond that already features the newly higher interest rate. This does not affect the interest payments to the <b>bondholder,</b> so long-term investors who want a specific amount at the maturity date do not need to worry about price swings in their bonds and do not suffer from interest rate risk.|$|E
500|$|In Paris, Slidell {{had been}} {{approached}} by the banking firm Erlanger et Cie. [...] The company offered {{to float a loan}} to benefit the Confederacy. The proposed terms provided a large commission to Erlanger and would entitle the <b>bondholder</b> to cotton at a discounted price once the South won the war. Baron Frederic Emile d'Erlanger, head of the firm, journeyed to Richmond in early 1863, and negotiated with Benjamin, although the transaction properly fell within the jurisdiction of Treasury Secretary Memminger. The banker softened the terms somewhat, though they were still lucrative for his firm. [...] Benjamin felt the deal was worth it, as it would provide the Confederacy with badly needed funds to pay its agents in Europe.|$|E
500|$|The {{two main}} types of loans {{issued by the}} South during the war were [...] "Cotton Bonds", {{denominated}} in pounds sterling and sold in London, and high risk unbacked loans sold in the Netherlands. The Cotton Bonds were also convertible directly into bales of cotton, with a caveat, included {{as a means of}} political pressure on European countries to recognize the Confederacy, that any such shipments needed to be picked up by the <b>bondholder</b> in one of the blockaded Southern ports (mostly New Orleans). Cotton Bonds initially were very popular and in high demand among the British; William Ewart Gladstone, who at the time was the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was supposedly one of the buyers. The Confederate government managed to honor the Cotton Bonds throughout the war, and in fact their price rose steeply until the fall of Atlanta to Sherman, reflecting the increase in the underlying cotton prices and perhaps the possibility that George B. McClellan might get elected as US President on a peace platform. In contrast, the price of the Dutch-issued high risk loans fell throughout the war, and the South selectively defaulted on servicing these obligations.|$|E

2500|$|Conversely, {{it may be}} {{advantageous}} to the <b>bondholder</b> for the borrower to prepay if the low-coupon MBS pool was bought at a discount (<100).

So if the investor bought a bond at 95 cents on the dollar, as the borrower prepays he or she gets the full dollar back and his or her yield increases. However, this is unlikely to happen, as borrowers with low-coupon mortgages have very little incentive to refinance.|$|E
2500|$|The coupon is the {{interest}} rate that the issuer pays to the holder. Usually this rate is fixed throughout {{the life of the}} bond. It can also vary with a money market index, such as LIBOR, or it can be even more exotic. The name [...] "coupon" [...] arose because in the past, paper bond certificates were issued which had coupons attached to them, one for each interest payment. On the due dates the <b>bondholder</b> would hand in the coupon to a bank in exchange for {{the interest}} payment. Interest can be paid at different frequencies: generally semi-annual, i.e. every 6 months, or annual.|$|E
2500|$|Zero-coupon bonds (zeros) pay no regular interest. They {{are issued}} at a {{substantial}} discount to par value, {{so that the}} interest is effectively rolled up to maturity (and usually taxed as such). The <b>bondholder</b> receives the full principal amount on the redemption date. An example of zero coupon bonds is Series E savings bonds issued by the U.S. government. Zero-coupon bonds may be created from fixed rate bonds by a financial institution separating ("stripping off") the coupons from the principal. In other words, the separated coupons and the final principal payment of the bond may be traded separately. [...] See IO (Interest Only) and PO (Principal Only).|$|E
