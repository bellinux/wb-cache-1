5|$|SETI {{researcher}} Carl Sagan {{believed that}} a civilization with the technological prowess needed to reach the stars and come to Earth must have transcended war to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> self-destruction. Representatives of such a civilization would treat humanity with dignity and respect, and humanity, with its relatively backward technology, would {{have no choice but}} to reciprocate. Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute, disagrees, stating that the finite quantity of resources in the galaxy would cultivate aggression in any intelligent species, and that an explorer civilization that would want to contact humanity would be aggressive. Similarly, Ragbir Bhathal claims that since the laws of evolution would be the same on another habitable planet as they are on Earth, an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization may have the motivation to colonize humanity, much as British colonizers did to the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E

On July 16, {{a little more}} than two weeks after the initial assault allegations, the Lakers announced the signings of veteran free agents and former All-Stars Karl Malone and Gary Payton, who were recruited by O'Neal. After the signings, the Lakers were widely considered the favorite to win the NBA title.

25|$|He criticized Mel Lastman's {{plans to}} provide public {{funding for the}} North York Performing Arts Centre in 1991, arguing {{that it was an}} {{unnecessary}} expense and that private entrepreneur Garth Drabinsky would be the primary beneficiary. (Drabinsky was later charged with accounting fraud after Livent went bankrupt.) Moscoe also criticized the municipal election reforms passed by David Peterson's government in the same period, arguing that large land developers would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> donation limits without difficulty.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{industries}} (small-scale services, for example) tend to {{have more}} VAT avoidance, particularly where cash transactions predominate, and VAT may be criticized for encouraging this. From the perspective of government, however, VAT may be preferable because it captures {{at least some of the}} value added. For example, a building contractor may offer to provide services for cash (i.e. without a receipt, and without VAT) to a homeowner, who usually cannot claim input VAT back. The homeowner will thus bear lower costs and the building contractor may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> other taxes (profit or payroll taxes).|$|E

25|$|Courtship {{occurs in}} two phases. During the aerial phase, a male pursues and often forces a female to the ground. During the ground phase, the {{butterflies}} copulate and remain attached for about 30 to 60 minutes. Only 30% of mating attempts end in copulation, suggesting that females may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> mating, though some have more success than others. During copulation, a male transfers his spermatophore to a female. Along with sperm, the spermatophore provides a female with nutrition, which aids her in egg laying. An increase in spermatophore size increases the fecundity of female monarchs. Males that produce larger spermatophores also fertilize more females' eggs.|$|E
25|$|Opinion polls {{previous}} to {{the result}} suggested that Scioli would win {{by a wide}} margin, and might even <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> a ballotage. However, the final results showed only a narrow lead for Scioli, with his 37.08% just ahead of Macri's 34.15%, leading to new elections on 22 November. Massa got the third place, with 21% of the vote, and both candidates sought to secure the voters that had voted for him. Both candidates were polarized on the opinion about the presidency of Cristina Kirchner: Scioli proposes to keep most of the Kirchnerite policies, and Macri to change them. In the legislative elections, the FPV lost {{the majority of the}} chamber of deputies, but keeps the majority of the senate.|$|E

An array of hit avoidance systems would be leveraged and the Army offered the various active protection systems {{developed for the}} manned ground vehicle program. The GCV enabled the detection and neutralization of mines at standoff ranges. The vehicle was also to be equipped with an engagement detection system. The Army required the IFV to have the passive blast protection level equal to the MRAP. The Army made available {{the composition of the}} armor of the manned ground vehicle program. A transparent armor shield would provide protection for the vehicle commander when exposed through the turret. Personnel would leverage harnesses and restraints to mitigate trauma. In addition, a Vehicle Health Management System would provide vehicle diagnostic monitoring systems for commanders. A fire suppression system and ammunition detonation protection would be utilized for damage control.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} in which these polls took place, Ban made major speeches to the Asia Society and the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City. To be confirmed, Ban needed not only to win the support of the {{diplomatic}} community, but also to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> a veto from any of the five permanent members of the council: People's Republic of China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Ban was popular in Washington for having pushed to send South Korean troops to Iraq, and had the support of the Bush administration as he pursued the position. But Ban also opposed several U.S. positions: he expressed his support for the International Criminal Court and favoured an entirely non-confrontational approach to dealing with North Korea. Ban said during his campaign {{that he would like to}} visit North Korea in person to meet with Kim Jong-il directly. Ban was viewed as a stark contrast from Kofi Annan, who was considered charismatic, but perceived as a weak manager because of problems surrounding the UN's oil-for-food program in Iraq.|$|E
25|$|The Polish {{interest}} in {{an alliance with}} Brandenburg-Prussia {{was born out of}} the need to end the war with Sweden as soon as possible. On 3 November 1656, the Truce of Vilna had promised Alexis of Russia's election as successor on the Polish throne at the next diet in turn for halting his offensive in Poland-Lithuania and fight Sweden instead. While in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania there was support for this treaty among the nobles, who hoped for more privileged positions, this was not true for the Kingdom of Poland, where the elites looked for ways to circumvent Alexis' succession. To quickly end the war with Sweden and thus <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the implementation of Vilna, the anti-Swedish alliance had to be extended. The new-won Russian ally was reluctant to support Poland against Sweden as long as no diet had confirmed Vilna. A second ally, the Austrian Habsburgs were won in the first and second Vienna treaties, yet as the Habsburg forces were to be maintained by Poland, this alliance's prize was bound to rise the longer the war lasted. A third ally was Denmark-Norway, who joined the anti-Swedish coalition in June 1657 triggered by the second treaty of Vienna. Yet, Denmark was not fighting on Polish soil, and although her involvement bound Charles X Gustav's forces and a formal alliance with Poland-Lithuania was concluded in July, the Danish war aim was to recover Scandinavian territories lost in the Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645).|$|E

The expansion will allow [...] Norman residents a high-speed, limited-access route to the west without having to enter the heavily trafficked areas of Oklahoma City. Future plans call for an extension east and north of the Turnpike to connect Norman directly to Interstate 40 east and the Turner Turnpike to Tulsa, greatly reducing travel times for residents because they will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> Oklahoma City's traffic in all directions except for northbound Interstate 35.|$|E
