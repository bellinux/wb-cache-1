500|$|The {{newly built}} {{passenger}} steamboat SSHome {{was en route}} from New York City to Charleston, South Carolina, when she encountered strengthening northeasterly winds on October 8. As the storm worsened that night, the [...] craft began to leak due to a broken <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> pipe. The next morning, as the Home took on more water than the pumps could handle, the captain steered her aground [...] north of Cape Hatteras. The vessel got underway again shortly thereafter, {{in an effort to}} reach the relative shelter of the cape's leeward side and beach her there.|$|E
500|$|Costain {{constructed}} the foundations and cable tunnels; Sir Robert McAlpine laid {{the roads and}} built the ancillary buildings; Mowlem laid the deep foundations; Alfred McAlpine built the administration and control buildings; Balfour Beatty undertook general building works; and James Scott installed cabling. Tarmac Construction undertook the civil engineering works; Holst Civil Engineers built the chimney; N.G. Bailey installed cabling; Reyrolle, English Electric and South Wales Switchgear produced and installed the switchgear; English Electric manufactured the generator cooling water pumps; T.W. Broadbent maintained the temporary electrical supplies; and Sulzer Brothers manufactured the <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> pumps. In both phases the boilers were made by Babcock Power Ltd and the generators by C. A. Parsons and Company.|$|E
500|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War II {{made it impossible}} to remove her from service, and as a consequence she never received the scheduled modernisation afforded to other capital ships such as the battlecruiser [...] and several of the s. The ship's condensers were in such bad condition by this time that much of the output from the fresh-water evaporators was required to replenish the <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> water and could not be used by the crew to wash and bathe or even to heat the mess decks during cold weather as the steam pipes were too leaky. These problems also reduced her steam output so that she was unable to attain her designed speed.|$|E

2500|$|Standard displacement, {{also known}} as [...] "Washington displacement", is a {{specific}} term defined by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922.

2500|$|In 1996, {{removal of}} some [...] per {{year from the}} river was covered by {{abstraction}} licences. Major holders of licences included British Steel plc, Centrica and Anglian Water. British Steel take water for the Scunthorpe Steelworks from a pumping station immediately {{to the north of}} Worlaby railway bridge. Centrica run the Glanford Brigg Power Station, located on {{the west bank of the}} river near Brigg. It is a gas-fired generating station, capable of producing 240 MW from six turbines. Water is taken from the river to supplement cooling water lost by evaporation, and some of the cooling water is discharged to the river to prevent a build up of suspended and dissolved solids. Water is also processed by a treatment plant, where it is filtered and ion-exchanged, to provide a clean supply for the boilers, which will not cause scaling or corrosion. Like the cooling water, the <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> water is also purged regularly, to prevent dissolved solids building up.|$|E

50|$|In construction, {{provision}} {{was made on}} site for a fourth generating unit (to {{the north of the}} existing units), including a fourth stack inside the chimney, but the fourth generating unit was cancelled before construction commenced. One design feature of the power station is the lack of steam driven <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> pumps, with units 1 and 2 being provided with three 50% electric <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> pumps and unit 3 with two 50% electric feed pumps.

50|$|Industrial {{cogeneration}} plants normally {{operate at}} much lower boiler pressures than utilities. Among the reasons are: 1) Cogeneration plants face possible contamination of returned condensate. Because <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> water from cogeneration plants has much lower return rates than 100% condensing power plants, industries usually {{have to treat}} proportionately more boiler make up water. <b>Boiler</b> <b>feed</b> water must be completely oxygen free and de-mineralized, and the higher the pressure the more critical the level of purity of the feed water. 2) Utilities are typically larger scale power than industry, which helps offset the higher capital costs of high pressure. 3) Utilities {{are less likely to}} have sharp load swings than industrial operations, which deal with shutting down or starting up units that may represent a significant percent of either steam or power demand.|$|E
