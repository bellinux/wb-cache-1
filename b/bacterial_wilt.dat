25|$|Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis is the causative {{agent of}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>wilt</b> and canker of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.).|$|E
25|$|The {{causal agent}} of <b>bacterial</b> <b>wilt</b> and canker of tomato survives in or on seeds {{for up to}} 8 months but {{occasionally}} also in plant refuse in the soil. The pathogen can be spread long distances because of its association with seeds. The risk of spreading the bacteria to healthy tomato plants is greatest during transplanting, tying, and suckering or any time when the host may be wounded. Once the bacteria enters the plant through a wound, it will move and multiply primarily in the xylem vessels. Once established, the bacteria may move into the phloem, pith, and cortex. Infection can result in either systemic or superficial disease. Systemic infections appear in 3–6 weeks {{and the risk of}} secondary infection goes up with water-splashing. The common occurrence of latent infections – presence of the pathogen within the host yet the host shows no symptoms – makes this pathogen especially dangerous.|$|E
40|$|The <b>bacterial</b> <b>wilts</b> {{of banana}} known as Moko disease, Bugtok disease and blood disease {{are caused by}} members of the R. solanacearum species complex. R. solanacearum is a {{heterogeneous}} species which has been divided into 4 genetic groups known as phylotypes. Within the R. solanacearum species complex, strains that cause Moko and Bugtok diseases belong to phylotype II. The blood disease bacterium, the cause of blood disease, belongs to phylotype IV. This study employs phylogenetic analysis of partial endoglucanase gene sequences to further assess the evolutionary relationships between strains of R. solanacearum causing Moko disease and Bugtok disease and the relationship of the blood disease bacterium to other R. solanacearum strains within phylotype IV of the R. solanacearum species complex. These analyses showed that R. solanacearum Moko disease-causing strains are polyphyletic, forming four related, but distinct, clusters of strains. One of these clusters is a previously unrecognised group of R. solanacearum Moko disease-causing strains. It was also found that R. solanacearum strains that cause Bugtok disease are indistinguishable from strains causing Moko disease in the Philippines. Phylogenetic analysis of partial endoglucanase gene sequences of the strains of the blood disease confirms a close relationship of these strains to R. solanacearum strains within phylotype IV of the R. solanacearum species complex...|$|R

D. dadantii, more commonly known as: soft rot, brown rot or blackleg, causes characteristic symptoms associated with other <b>bacterial</b> <b>wilts,</b> causing final diagnosis to be difficult. The pathogen primarily seeks {{to attack the}} plant's xylem vessels located in leaves, stems, blossoms and storage organs of herbaceous plants. D. dadantii is able to infect hosts {{at any point in}} its life cycle. In addition to symptoms of wilt, the disease appears as sunken and cracked external lesions also having a brown interior in cross section in subterranean bulbs and tubers [...] Diseased plants will display a variety of symptoms including: wilting, stunting and vascular discoloration of the stems. Early symptoms include water soaked lesions at the site of infection, gradually expanding chlorotic leaves and loss of turgor in tissues. [...] The intensity of D. dadantii colonization relates to the amount of disease and degree of damage. The pathogen is very successful at infiltrating host tissues due to the many pectinases responsible for diassembly of plant cell wall polysaccharides. Once the cell wall is degraded cellular structure collapses and this cell maceration gives a characteristic [...] "water-soaked" [...] or rotted appearance. [...] D. dadantii grow intercellularly, continuing to degrade cells and colonize, until it eventually reaches xylem tissues. Upon reaching the xylem vessels D. dadantii possesses the ability to spread to new regions of the host and other areas may begin to display symptoms. Colonization within the xylem restricts flow of water causing loss of turgor pressure and wilting of foliage and stems. Restricted movement of important plant compounds eventually lead to death of the host.|$|R

It provides strong support to the livelihood of small-scale farmers through its contributions to their nutritional security, income generation and soil fertility enhancement. Worldwide about 6. 5 million metric tons of cowpea are produced annually on about 14. 5 million hectares. The low productivity of cowpea is attributable to numerous abiotic and biotic constraints. The abiotic stress factors comprise drought, low soil fertility, and heat while biotic constraints include insects, diseases, parasitic weeds, and nematodes. Cowpea farmers also have limited access to quality seeds of improved varieties for planting. Some progress has been made through conventional breeding at international and national research institutions in the last three decades. Cowpea improvement could also benefit from modern breeding methods based on molecular genetic tools. A number of advances in cowpea genetic linkage maps, and quantitative trait loci associated with some desirable traits such as resistance to Striga, Macrophomina, Fusarium <b>wilt,</b> <b>bacterial</b> blight, root-knot nematodes, aphids, and foliar thrips have been reported. An improved consensus genetic linkage map has been developed and used to identify QTLs of additional traits. In order to take advantage of these developments single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping is being streamlined to establish an efficient workflow supported by genotyping support service (GSS) -client interactions. About 1100 SNPs mapped on the cowpea genome were converted by LGC Genomics to KASP assays. Several cowpea breeding programs have been exploiting these resources to implement molecular breeding, especially for MARS and MABC, to accelerate cowpea variety improvement. The combination of conventional breeding and molecular breeding strategies, with workflow managed through the CGIAR breeding management system (BMS), promises an increase in the number of improved varieties available to farmers, thereby boosting cowpea production and productivity in SSA.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of plant-R. solanacearum interactions, we used differential display to isolate a cDNA fragment, A 6, regulated in tobacco by inoculation with RsOE 1 - 1. The deduced {{amino acid sequence}} predicted from full-length A 6 -cDNA showed similarity to small heat shock proteins from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana; hypothetical protein), Medicago truncatula, and Cucumis melo; we therefore designated A 6 to correspond to Ntshsp 17 (for tobacco small heat shock protein 17). Recombinant Ntshsp 17 overproduced in Escherichia coli exhibited molecular chaperone function. Expression of Ntshsp 17 was increased in tobacco leaves inoculated with both RsOE 1 - 1 and Rs 8107. Expression was induced by heat treatment and by treatment with aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid, hydrogen peroxide, methyl jasmonate, and salicylic acid. Ntshsp 17 expression was induced by inoculation with a HR and pathogenicity gene mutant of Rs 8107 that does not induce the HR, but not by Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of INF 1, an HR elicitor.

40|$|Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis (Cmm) is the {{pathogen}} causing bacterial  canker in tomato. The disease was described {{for the first}} time in 1910 in Michigan, USA. Cmmis considered the most harmful bacteria threatening tomato. Disease transmission occurs via seed and symptoms become visible at least 20 days after infection. Due to its complex strategy and transmission, Cmm is under quarantine regulation in EU and other countries. There is no method to stop disease progress in plants after infection. Thus, disease management consists usually of chemical treatments as protection and by careful clean cultural practices. However, the use of resistant varieties is the most effective and environmentally friendly method. Unfortunately, there is no cultivar harboring effective resistance on the market although efforts to get resistant varieties already started in the 60 s. Our aim in this thesis was to develop valuable genetic material for breeders in order to enable them to release resistant cultivars and provide comprehensive scientific knowledge for further detailed research about Cmm. Our scientific activity in this thesis started with the identification of new Cmm resistance sources and confirmation of existent ones. In Chapter 3 we have screened a collection of wild tomatoes for resistance to Cmm. We made use of Real Time TaqMan PCR for intensive phenotyping. Using <b>wilting</b> and <b>bacterial</b> concentration as parameters for evaluation of the sources, we have identified new sources and confirmed existent ones. We have decided to continue further with one new source, S. pimpinellifolium, and one existent source, S. arcanum. We continued our research in Chapter 4 with a genetic analysis of the new source coming from S. pimpinellifolium. A recombinant inbred line population  between the resistant parent, S. pimpinellifolium, and the susceptible parent S. lycopersicum was evaluated in three different environments. <b>Wilting,</b> <b>bacterial</b> concentration, and stem discoloration were the scored  parameters. Responses of resistance in different environments were determined and genomic regions responsible for different responses were mapped. In Chapter 5, we have continued our research by fine mapping of previously identified genomic regions and developing nearly isogenic lines containing those genomic regions. By doing fine mapping, we made use of old stock DNA and recently developed different types of SNP marker technology. Previously identified Quantitative Trait Loci(QTLs) could be more precisely delimited. During isogenic line development, embryo rescue was used in order to break the genetic barrier between our S. arcanum source and tomato. Marker assisted backcrossing was applied to obtain lines with a minimum of donor parent in a faster way. By using this method we gained two generations of backcrossing. In order to obtain comprehensive information about different Cmm isolates inTurkey, we have performed multi locus sequence analysis (MLST) analysis on a Cmm collection, which was collected in 20 years of time in different part of Turkey. In Chapter 6 a statistical analysis of this collection revealed that measurement of clonality of this collection was possible as well as it was possible to predict the virulence level of strainsusing a subset of housekeeping genes. All knowledge gained by our experiments and knowledge coming from literature about Cmm have led a Review paper, Chapter 2, by which comprehensive information about Cmm resistance sources, genetic analysis of these sources, detection methods of Cmm, infection strategies of Cmm and interaction with its host was discussed. In conclusion, two good Cmm resistance sources and several tools and methods are available for breeders. Genomic regions of these sources associated with resistance were determined.

40|$|Vascular wilt pathogens, which {{comprise}} bacteria, fungi and oomycetes, {{are among}} the most destructive plant pathogens that affect annual crops as well as woody perennials, thus not only impacting world food and feed production but also natural ecosystems. Vascular wilt pathogens colonize the xylem vessels of their host plants and interfere with the normal transportation of water and nutrients from the roots to upper parts of the plant, thus causing wilting symptoms. The structure and composition of xylem vessels has {{a significant impact on the}} colonization of host plants by these pathogens. Presently, genetic resistance is the most preferred control strategy against this group of plant pathogens. Verticillium wilt disease, which is caused by the vascular fungal pathogen Verticillium spp., is among the major diseases in various horticultural crops in tropical, subtropical, and temperate agro-ecological regions. The genus Verticilllium comprises of three major plant pathogenic species; V. dahliae, V. albo-atrum,and V. longisporum. While V. dahliae and V. albo-atrum arecharacterized with the ability to infect broad host range, V. longisporum has relatively limited host range infecting mainly crucifers family. V. dahliae and V. albo-atrum isolates are categorized into race 1 and race 2 based on their ability to infect tomato plants containing a Ve 1 resistance gene. On tomato, while race 1 isolates are contained by Ve 1 resistance gene, race 2 isolates overcome Ve 1 -mediated resistance. Chapter 1 is the introduction to the thesis that describes xylem defence responses that are directed against vascular wilt pathogens. Plants recognize xylem-invading vascular wilt pathogens by using extracellular or intracellular receptors. Pathogen recognition activates innate immune responses that include physical and chemical defense responses in the xylem vessels and the surrounding parenchyma cells. While physical defense responses often halt pathogen movement between vessels, chemical defense responses can eliminate the pathogen or inhibit its growth, thereby leading to resistance.   In order to identify novel sources of Verticillium wilt resistance, a collection of activation-tagged Arabidopsis mutants was screened for plants that displayed enhanced Verticillium wilt resistance. Chapter 2 describes four mutants (A 1 to A 4) that showed enhanced resistance to not only V. dahliae, but also to V. albo-atrum, and the Brassicaceae pathogen V. longisporum. Further characterization of resistance in these mutants against other vascular wilt pathogens, Ralstonia solanacearum and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Raphani, and the foliar pathogens such Botrytis cinerea, Plectosphaerella cucumerina, Alternaria brassicicola, and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, is presented in this chapter. Except for mutant A 2, that showed enhanced resistance to R. solanacearum, and mutants A 1 and A 3, that showed enhanced susceptibility to P. syringae, all the mutants responded similar as wild-type plants to these pathogens. In chapter 2, we furthermore describe the cloning and functional characterization of the gene encoding the AT-hook DNA-binding protein AHL 19 that is responsible for the enhanced resistance of the A 1 mutant to Verticillium wilt disease. The Arabidopsis genome contains 29 AHL proteins (Fujimoto et al., 2004) some of which have been implicated in various biological processes including plant development (Lim et al., 2007; Xiao et al., 2009) and defense (Kim et al., 2007 Kim et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2010). AHL 19 provides Verticillium wilt resistance upon over-expression, whereas knock-out enhances susceptibility, indicating that AHL 19 positively regulates Verticillium wilt resistance. AHL 19 not only regulates Verticillium wilt resistance, but also affects plant development, as AHL 19 over-expressing plants showed larger leaf size, delayed maturity, and low seed production (Yadeta et al., 2011). Chapter 3 describes the cloning and functional characterization of EVR 1 (for E nhanced V erticillium R esistance 1), the gene that is responsible for the enhanced Verticillium wilt resistance in mutant A 2. Mutant A 2 furthermore confers resistance to the <b>bacterial</b> vascular <b>wilt</b> pathogen R. solanacearum (Yadeta et al., 2011). While EVR 1 over-expression enhances Arabidopsis resistance to three vascular wilt pathogens: V. dahliae, R. solanacearum, and F. oxysporum, knock-out enhances susceptibility to V. dahliae and R. solanacearum. Furthermore, EVR 1 appears to regulate drought stress resistance. EVR 1 is a single copy gene that encodes a protein of unknown function, and EVR 1 homologs are only found in Brassicaceae species thus far. Interestingly, over-expression of the B. oleraceae EVR 1 homolog in Arabidopsis conferred Verticillium wilt resistance. Moreover, over-expression of Arabidopsis and B. oleraceae EVR 1 and BoEVR 1 in the Solanaceous species N. benthamiana enhanced Verticillium wilt resistance. This suggests that the Brassicaceae-specific EVR 1 gene can be used to engineer Verticillium wilt resistance in other plant families. Whereas chapters 2 and 3 focus on the identification of novel sources of Verticillium wilt resistance by screening a collection of Arabidopsis gain-of-function mutants, Chapter 4 describes the identification of novel Verticillium wilt resistance in wild tomato accessions. Six wild accessions were identified that displayed enhanced resistance to race 2 isolates. Surprisingly, however, these accessions did not show enhanced resistance to race 1 isolates. Using virus-induced gene silencing, the resistance signalling leading to race 2 resistance in the wild accessions was investigated, showing that the resistance signalling in the wild accessions is distinct from the signalling pathway employed by the resistance protein Ve 1. Finally in chapter 5, the highlights of this thesis are discussed and placed in a broader perspective.  ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>wilt</b> of turfgrass is {{the only}} known {{bacterial}} disease of turf. The causal agent is the Gram negative bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. graminis. The first case of <b>bacterial</b> <b>wilt</b> of turf was reported in a cultivar of creeping bentgrass known as Toronto or C-15, which is found throughout the midwestern United States. Until the causal agent was identified in 1984, the disease was referred to simply as C-15 decline. This disease is almost exclusively found on putting greens at golf courses where extensive mowing creates wounds in the grass which the pathogen uses in order to enter the host and cause disease.|$|E
50|$|Prolonged {{periods of}} wetness and/or poorly drained soils, {{followed}} by warm, sunny days and cool nights constitute the optimal conditions for <b>bacterial</b> <b>wilt.</b> Thus, transitions between spring and summer, and summer and autumn are usually accompanied by increases in <b>bacterial</b> <b>wilt</b> of turf grass as these seasonal changes, {{especially in the}} early fall, bring sustained rainfalls and longer, cooler nights. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>wilt</b> of turf grass {{has been reported in}} several regions of Illinois, as well as other Midwestern states such as Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin. Antiserum produced from an isolate of this pathogen in Illinois was found to have reacted to another such isolate from Europe, suggesting that the pathogen was brought over to North America from Europe. In fact, a survey of wheat and rye fields in Western Scotland demonstrated Xanthomonas campestris pv. graminis infection in 71% of the fields, with rye grass bearing the most infection. Meadow fescue from the same fields also demonstrated susceptibility to the pathogen under laboratory conditions, further pointing to Europe as the potential origin of this pathogen in the United States.|$|E
