5|$|After the war, Bacher {{returned}} to Ithaca to head Cornell's Laboratory for Nuclear Studies. He agreed with Bethe that what Cornell needed {{to become a}} major player in high energy nuclear physics was a new synchrotron, <b>but</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> needed to find somewhere to put it. However, in 1946 Bacher was appointed to the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the new United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, along with fellow United States representatives Tolman and Oppenheimer. Bacher therefore had to divide his time between Ithaca and New York City.|$|E
5|$|Ford reluctantly {{agreed to}} run for office in 1976, <b>but</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> had to counter a {{challenge}} for the Republican party nomination. Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan and the party's conservative wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in South Vietnam, for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal. (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries, including North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and California, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the Republican Convention in Kansas City, Missouri. The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.|$|E
5|$|His wartime {{experiences}} led Fitch {{to decide}} to become a physicist. Robert Bacher, {{the head of the}} physics division at Los Alamos, offered him a graduate assistantship at Cornell University, <b>but</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> needed to complete his undergraduate degree. Rather than return to Northwestern or Carnegie Mellon, he elected to enter McGill University, which Titterton had recommended. Fitch graduated from McGill with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1948. On the advice of Jerry Kellogg, who had been a student of Rabi's at Columbia University, and was a division head at the Los Alamos, Fitch decided to pursue his doctoral studies at Columbia. Kellogg wrote him a letter of introduction to Rabi. James Rainwater became his academic supervisor. Rainwater gave him a paper by John Wheeler concerning mu-mesic atoms, atoms in which an electron is replaced by a muon. These had never been observed; they were completely theoretical and {{there was no evidence that}} they existed, but it made a good thesis topic.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge is}} named after Frances Pulteney, wife of William Johnstone. He was a wealthy Scottish lawyer and Member of Parliament. Frances was the third {{daughter}} of MP and government official Daniel Pulteney (1684–1731) and first cousin once removed of William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath. She inherited the Earl's substantial fortune and estates close to Bath in Somerset {{after his death in}} 1764 and that of his younger brother and heir in 1767, and the Johnstones changed their surname to Pulteney. The rural Bathwick estate, which Frances and William inherited in 1767, was across the river from the city and could only be reached by ferry. William made plans to create a new town, which would become a suburb to the historic city of Bath, <b>but</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> needed a better river crossing. The work of the Pulteneys is memorialised by Great Pulteney Street in Bathwick, and Henrietta Street and Laura Place, named after their daughter Henrietta Laura Johnstone.|$|E

He saw there the Japanese collection from the 1680s of the German naturalist Engelbert Kaempfer (1651–1716), who had preceded him at Dejima. He also met Forster, who introduced him to his collections he had obtained during Cook's second voyage.|$|E

25|$|To {{play for}} time, Napoleon {{authorized}} Masséna {{to propose a}} truce. He did so, and Archduke Charles accepted. On 29 September, a convention was drawn up whereby the armies would not begin fighting until six days after one side notified the other. A week later, Masséna sent word to Charles that hostilities would begin on 14 October. On 17 October Charles received word that Napoleon was in Munich. Foreseeing the disastrous outcome of the Ulm Campaign, the archduke made plans to withdraw from Italy. <b>But</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> would defend himself against a French attack.|$|E

Doch er soll erst wissen—"Let him die! <b>But</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> should know"). As Pizarro brandishes a dagger, Fidelio leaps between him and Florestan and reveals her identity as Leonore, the wife of Florestan.

25|$|After the Yongle Emperor's {{overthrow}} of the Jianwen Emperor, China's countryside was devastated. The fragile new economy {{had to deal with}} low production and depopulation. The Yongle Emperor laid out a long and extensive plan to strengthen and stabilise the new economy, <b>but</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> had to silence dissension. He created an elaborate system of censors to remove corrupt officials from office that spread such rumors. The emperor dispatched some of his most trusted officers to reveal or destroy secret societies, bandits, and loyalists to his other relatives. To strengthen the economy, he fought population decline by reclaiming land, utilising the most he could from the existing labour force, and maximising textile and agricultural production.|$|E
25|$|Pelléas arrives {{alone at}} the well. He is worried that he has become deeply {{involved}} with Mélisande and fears the consequences. He knows he must leave <b>but</b> <b>first,</b> <b>he</b> wants to see Mélisande one last time and tell her things he has kept to himself. Mélisande arrives. She was able to slip out without Golaud's noticing. At first she is distant but when Pelléas tells her he is going away she becomes more affectionate. After admitting his love for her, Mélisande confesses that she has loved him since she first saw him. Pelléas hears the servants shutting the castle gates for the night. Now they are locked out, but Mélisande {{says that it is}} for the better. Pelléas is resigned to fate too. After the two kiss, Mélisande hears something moving in the shadows. It is Golaud, who has been watching the couple from behind a tree. Golaud strikes down a defenseless Pelléas with his sword and kills him. Mélisande is also wounded but she flees into the woods saying to a dying Pelléas that she does not have courage.|$|E
25|$|Ford {{chose to}} seek {{election}} {{to a full}} term in 1976, <b>but</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> had to counter a challenge for the Republican party nomination. The pardon of Nixon and the disastrous 1974 mid-term elections had weakened Ford's standing within the party, and Ford's other actions as president had alienated the conservative wing of the party. Conservative Republicans were disappointed with the selection of Rockefeller as vice president and faulted Ford for the Fall of Saigon, the amnesty for draft dodgers, and the continuation of détente policies, particularly {{with regards to the}} signing of the Helsinki Accords. Ronald Reagan, a leader among the conservatives, launched his campaign in autumn of 1975. Hoping to appease his party's right wing and sap Reagan's momentum, Ford requested that Rockefeller not seek re-election, and the vice president agreed to this request. Ford defeated Reagan in the first several primaries, but Reagan gained momentum after winning North Carolina's March 1976 primary. Entering the 1976 Republican National Convention, neither Ford nor Reagan had won a majority of delegates through the primaries, but Ford was able to win the support of enough unpledged delegates to win the presidential nomination. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas won the vice presidential nomination.|$|E

25|$|As {{the year}} 654 continued, shortly after Consort Wu {{had given birth}} to her daughter, the baby died, with some {{evidence}} suggesting deliberate strangulation, including allegations by Wu, the child's mother. Consort Wu accused Wang of murder. Wu's rival Wang was accused of having been seen near the child's room, with corroborating testimony by alleged eyewitnesses. Emperor Gaozong was led to believe that Wang had the means to kill the child, and likely done so, motivated by jealousy. Wang lacked an alibi, and was unable to clear herself. Angry, Emperor Gaozong considered deposing Empress Wang and elevating Consort Wu to her position; <b>but,</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> {{wanted to make sure that}} the government chancellors would support this. So, Gaozong visited the house of his uncle Zhangsun Wuji, the head chancellor, together with Consort Wu (later Emperor Gaozong would award Chancellor Zhangsun with much treasure). During the meeting, Gaozong several times brought up the topic of Empress Wang's childlessness, a topic easily leading to an excuse sufficient to depose her; however, Zhangsun repeatedly found ways to divert the conversation. Subsequent visits by Consort Wu's mother Lady Yang and the official Xu Jingzong, who was allied with Consort Wu, to seek support from Zhangsun also were to no avail. Scientifically credible forensic pathology information about the death of the child does not exist, and scholars lack real, concrete evidence about her death. However, speculation seems to continue.|$|E
500|$|Iðunn is {{introduced}} in the Prose Edda in section 26 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning. Here, Iðunn is described as Bragi's wife and keeper of an eski (a wooden box made of ash wood and often used for carrying personal possessions) within which she keeps apples. The apples are bitten into by the gods when they begin to grow old and they then become young again, which is described as occurring up until Ragnarök. Gangleri (described as King Gylfi in disguise) states {{that it seems to}} him that the gods depend greatly upon Iðunn's good faith and care. With a laugh, High responds that misfortune once came close, that he could tell Gangleri about it, <b>but</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> must hear the names of more of the Æsir, and he continues providing information about gods.|$|E
500|$|Franklin {{invented the}} {{lightning}} rod {{based on what}} he learned from experiments with his electrostatic machine. [...] Franklin and his associates observed that pointed objects were more effective than blunt objects at [...] "drawing off" [...] and [...] "throwing off" [...] sparks from static electricity. This discovery was first reported by Hopkinson. Franklin wondered if this discovery could be used in a practical invention. [...] He thought something could be made to attract the electricity out of storm clouds, <b>but</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> had to verify that lightning bolts really are giant electric sparks. He wrote Collinson and Cadwallader Colden letters about this theory. The 1752 Franklin letter to Collinson of October 19 of the kite experiment is noted by historian LeMay as a basis how it proved that lightning was electricity. Tom Tucker of the Isothermal Community College doubts the account however because of ambiguities in the account and points that out in his book Bolt of Fate: Benjamin Franklin and his Electric Kite Hoax. Others disagree with this view, arguing that Franklin would not make up such a fake story because he valued the integrity of the scientific community.|$|E
