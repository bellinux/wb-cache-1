We climbed up to about 200 metres, when suddenly two Thunderbolts appeared <b>behind</b> <b>us</b> and instantly shot down Günther Kirchner's plane. I saw him jettison canopy and catapult but his parachute did not deploy. I was very lucky that the Thunderbolts did not press on with another attack.|$|E

25|$|Robert Dollar {{expressed}} ideas concerning one's legacy after death. He wrote: In {{this world}} all we leave <b>behind</b> <b>us</b> {{that is worth}} anything {{is that we can}} be well regarded and spoken of after we are gone, and that we can say that we left the world just a little better than we found it. If we can't accomplish these two things then life, according to my view, has been a failure. Many people erroneously speak of a man when he is gone as having left so much money. That, according to my view, amounts to very little.|$|E
25|$|On Sun News's {{first night}} of {{programming}} on April 18, 2011, 37,000 viewers nationwide tuned into the half-hour preview show, with 31,000 viewers staying to watch the first regular program, The Source with Ezra Levant; other first-day viewership levels included 31,000 for Charles Adler and 17,000 for Byline with Brian Lilley. After that first night, however, first-week viewership fell considerably, with the network attracting 12,000 viewers on April 20, only 1,000 of them within the advertiser-desired 25-54 age demographic. Viewership numbers did not improve going forward that week; on April 22 at 7:00p.m. Eastern Time, 11,000 viewers watched Sun News, well behind CBC News Network's number for that hour (263,000) and even <b>behind</b> <b>U.S.</b> import CNN (38,000).|$|E

Though several players were selected through the Veterans Committee and the Special Committee on the Negro Leagues that year, Banks was the only player elected by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. He was inducted on August 8 of that year. During his induction speech, Banks said, [...] "We've got the setting – sunshine, fresh air, the team <b>behind</b> <b>us.</b> So let's play two!" ...|$|E
500|$|At the Russian sides, 24th Division of Likhachov {{was sent}} into the battle. The Russian fought bravely under Likachev's motto: [...] "Brethren, <b>behind</b> <b>us</b> is Moscow !" [...] But the French troops {{approached}} {{too close for}} the cannons to fire, and the cannoneers had to use everything to fight against their foes. General Caulaincourt ordered Watier's cuirassier division to lead the assault. Barclay watched Eugène's assault preparations and countered it, moving his forces against it. The French artillery, however, began bombarding the assembling force even as it gathered. Caulaincourt led the attack of Watier's cuirassiers into the opening {{at the back of}} the redoubt and met his death as the charge was stopped cold by Russian musketry.|$|E
500|$|The race result left Johnson {{maintaining}} {{the lead in}} the Drivers' Championship with 6,492 points. After the race, Martin who finished fourth, was less optimistic about his championship chances, [...] "We've still got to go to Homestead and run like this again because we've still got that threat <b>behind</b> <b>us,</b> Jeff Gordon, especially." [...] Gordon maintained third with 6,323 points, forty-two ahead of Kurt Busch and one-hundred and sixteen in front of Stewart. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet maintained the lead with 256 points. Toyota remained second with 198 points. Ford followed with 161 points, six ahead of Dodge in fourth. 5.17 million people watched the race on television. The race took two hours, forty-nine minutes and twenty-six seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 1.033 seconds.|$|E

500|$|After a poor race in Canada, {{where he}} stalled {{on the grid}} before the {{formation}} lap before receiving a ten-second stop-go penalty as his mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the race started, Coulthard said that Ferrari could still {{be caught in the}} season's nine remaining races: [...] "We have to look towards Magny-Cours and put this (Montreal) race <b>behind</b> <b>us.</b> The championship is not over yet and although we cannot change what happened in Canada, we can try to close the gap." [...] Former World Champion and President of the British Racing Drivers Club (BRDC) Jackie Stewart backed Coulthard to clinch the title after Häkkinen's continuing run of poor results. Michael Schumacher came into the race confident that his car would perform well at the circuit. Benetton team principal Flavio Briatore played down his team's chances saying, [...] "We need a miracle to finish on the podium." ...|$|E
500|$|Gibson's early {{involvement}} with the film industry extended far {{beyond the confines of}} the Hollywood blockbuster system. At one point, he collaborated on a script with Kazakh director Rashid Nugmanov after an American producer had expressed an interest in a Soviet-American collaboration to star Soviet rock musician Viktor Tsoi. Despite being occupied with writing a novel, Gibson was reluctant to abandon the [...] "wonderfully odd project" [...] which involved [...] "ritualistic gang-warfare in some sort of sideways-future Leningrad" [...] and sent Jack Womack to Russia in his stead. Rather than producing a motion picture, a prospect that ended with Tsoi's death in a car crash, Womack's experiences in Russia ultimately culminated in his novel Let's Put the Future <b>Behind</b> <b>Us</b> and informed much of the Russian content of Gibson's Pattern Recognition. A similar fate befell Gibson's collaboration with Japanese filmmaker Sogo Ishii in 1991, a film they planned on shooting in the Walled City of Kowloon until the city was demolished in 1993.|$|E
500|$|One of the Orb's {{most notable}} {{contributions}} to electronic music is {{their idea of}} blurring the distinction between sampling and remixing. Albums such as Pomme Fritz, though released {{as a piece of}} original work, consist largely of manipulated samples. Conversely, the Orb's remixes typically use only small sections of the original track, most notably in the case of their single [...] "Toxygene". [...] "Toxygene" [...] was originally commissioned as a remix of Jean Michel Jarre's [...] "Oxygene 8" [...] from Oxygene 7-13. The Orb [...] "obliterated it" [...] and reassembled only a few fragments for their remix, much to the chagrin of Jarre, who reportedly refused to release it; The Orb released the track themselves under the name [...] "Toxygene", which further irritated Jarre, to whom Paterson retorted [...] "The French are always five years <b>behind</b> <b>us,</b> anyway." [...] In statements made after the release of [...] "Toxygene", Jarre denied that he rejected the original remix because of disliking it.|$|E

500|$|Bill Veeck hired Lemon {{to succeed}} Paul Richards as the Chicago White Sox manager on November 16, 1976. Lemon {{took over a}} Chicago team that {{finished}} in last place in the AL West in 1976. [...] "Bob {{is the type of}} manager we need {{at this stage of the}} game", Veeck said. During spring training of 1977, Lemon said, [...] "I think we'll surprise a few people." [...] White Sox shortstop Alan Bannister quickly noticed a difference. Comparing Richards to Lemon, Bannister said, [...] "He'd post the lineups 10 minutes before the game, and only then we'd find out who was playing and where. Lemon's made it a serious operation." [...] As late as August 14, the White Sox were in first place in the AL West. The White Sox finished with a 90–72 record, a 26-game improvement. The team finished third in AL West and Lemon won his second Manager of the Year Award. [...] "The fans got <b>behind</b> <b>us</b> after about three weeks. They had a lot to do with our success", Lemon said after being winning the award.|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} stated that {{following}} the troublesome final years signed to Geffen Records, being an independent act again helped improve their mood and approach, with Vig remarking, [...] "There were no expectations; {{no one even}} knew we were recording. So it was all under the radar and pretty casual and we all felt inspired after having that amount of time off ... when we started writing songs, they came fast and furious. We probably wrote 24, 25 songs {{over the course of}} a couple of months. Marker commented that [...] "the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what we were supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff. With all that <b>behind</b> <b>us,</b> it was suddenly exciting again and it felt a lot like it did when we first formed, which was really just sort of a fun idea that we had." [...] Manson added, [...] "People at record companies live in fear of being wrong. Music cannot thrive in that environment. It is an unruly art form. You can't keep treating it like sausage meat. You have to let it morph and move and breathe." ...|$|E
500|$|My Dinosaur Life was {{released}} to acclaim from music critics upon its debut on January 19, 2010, and it represented the band's all-time best chart performance, peaking at number 15 on the Billboard 200. The group supported Weezer on several dates during this time, {{and they began}} a headlining tour in late January in the US. In {{the first three months}} following the album's release, the band continued to tour heavily: they travelled to Australia for the national Soundwave festival, as well as to Japan and the UK. The band began to receive radio airplay {{for the first time in}} their career, and released a music video for the single [...] "Her Words Destroyed My Planet". They embarked on a large tour with Say Anything between October and November 2010, and premiered a self-shot video for [...] "A Lifeless Ordinary" [...] during that time. Columbia dropped the band later that year, with the commercial performance of My Dinosaur Life leading to the split. [...] "I guess we didn't do as well as they hoped or expected us to," [...] said Pierre that year. [...] "And we felt that having all their resources at our disposal would perhaps propel us into another dimension. But we are what we are regardless of what label or machine is <b>behind</b> <b>us.</b> We did exceptionally well, though, if you want to look strictly at sales numbers in today's climate." ...|$|E
