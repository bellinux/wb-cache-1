5|$|The {{relationship}} between the various extant manuscripts is complex, and a definitive scheme of how the various manuscripts {{relate to each other}} cannot be made. Blake, in his edition of the Liber, suggests that <b>Book</b> <b>I</b> once existed as a stand-alone work, which influenced the B manuscript. A separate Book II, with parts of Book III, was then written and combined with the stand-alone <b>Book</b> <b>I,</b> into either manuscript E or an earlier version of that manuscript. Book II was then revised, combined with parts of G, <b>Book</b> <b>I,</b> and parts of E to make manuscript F.|$|E
