5000|$|In her {{doctorate}} work, Baruchson-Arbib {{studied the}} private libraries {{of the north}} Italian Jews {{at the close of}} the Renaissance period. This study was later published in the book [...] "Books and Readers", as well as in a French-translated edition with a preface written by Professor Jean-Pierre Rothschild. The book and the subsequent research publications provide numerous scientific innovations on the literary interest and printing culture of Jews at the time of the counter-reformation when Hebrew books were persecuted. The book is based on a collection of manuscripts, altogether amounting to 628 pages that include 438 <b>book</b> <b>inventories,</b> which were located in the homes of 430 Jews and 8 synagogues of the Mantua Duchy, and which were presented to the censor, upon his request, for examination in 1595. The entire list of books is written in different handwriting, and part of the lists mention the name of the owner of the particular library and sometimes his profession. Altogether, the collection included 21,142 volumes, divided into 1234 titles in Hebrew, Yiddish, Italian, and Latin. The research by Baruchson-Arbib was based on deciphering and analyzing the entire dataset, in addition to researching the tax records of the community in an attempt to understand the influence of the socioeconomic background on the content of the libraries. The censors who were appointed to examine and expurgate the books deleting 'forbidden' parts, such as the words [...] "Goy" [...] were three apostates, headed by Domenico Gerosolimitano. The censors, who were highly paid by the Jewish community, visited the Jewish homes, deleted the 'forbidden' parts in red ink (which, to this day, allows reading the text underneath the ink), and signed their names on the last page of the books to affirm that the books do not contain anti-Christian paragraphs. Thus, Baruchson-Arbib concluded that all were satisfied with the arrangement; the church, which censored the books, the Jews, whose books were not burned (thus allowing them to study and pray), and Duke of Mantua, who continued to receive taxes from the Jews. Years later, Domenico Gerosolimitano wrote the [...] "Index Librorum Prohibitorum" [...] (Sefer ha-Zikkuk) - a guide to the forbidden parts in the books of Jews. The life and work of Domenico Gerosolimitano, who was originally a Rabbi in Israel, were studied extensively by a doctorate student of Baruchson-Arbib, Dr. Gila Prebor.|$|E

However, managing books {{in a large}} bookshelf and finding books on it often leads to tedious manual work, especially for large book collections where books might be missing or misplaced. Recently, deep neural models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have achieved great success for scene text detection and recognition. Motivated by these recent successes, we aim to investigate their viability in facilitating book management, a task that introduces further challenges including large amounts of cluttered scene text, distortion, and varied lighting conditions. In this paper, we present a library inventory building and retrieval system based on scene text reading methods.

40|$|Reading is an {{activity}} that is realised {{in a specific place}} and period by individuals with different backgrounds, interests, expectations, and degrees of literacy. Reconstructing reading and its different practices throughout history is therefore an elaborate task. This paper proposes the use of the 'reading spaces' model as a methodology to outline the reading possibilities for various social groups in specific historical periods and places. The study goes beyond the basic divide of the literate and the illiterate by considering a wider context and analysing the elements that can foster or limit reading. These influences have been determined through a review of existing historical reading studies and can be summarised into education, profession, socio-economic conditions, culture, and the legal and political system of any certain period. This particular approach to reading studies was developed as a method to study the activity of reading in seventeenth-century New Spain. The paper provides a theoretical framework for the reading spaces model as a basis and it then examines the various differentiators and conditions that influence reading in seventeenth-century colonial Mexico. Finally, it presents the analysis of three <b>book</b> <b>inventories</b> from that period and compares them to their corresponding reading spaces...|$|E
40|$|Questions of gender, feminism, and écriture {{feminine}} {{in individual}} cases {{continue to be}} given priority in studies of women’s writing in Baroque Spain, {{to the exclusion of}} study of the wealth of original sources that show women participating freely and equally in all aspects of the Republic of Letters, as contemporaries called the literary profession. My doctoral thesis seeks to correct this imbalance by charting the rise and consolidation of the status and image of women as authors in and around the period now recognized as having seen the beginnings of the literary profession, 1600 - 1650. I take as my field the república literaria in the Spanish Atlantic empire in the period 1450 – 1700, with parallels from England, France and Italy. Using Genette’s studies of the paratext (2001) and Darnton’s theory of the “communication circuit” (2006), and building on the work of cultural historians (Bouza 1992, 1997, 2001; Bourdieu 1993; Chartier 1994; Cayuela 1996 & 2005), I examine the role of women as authors and readers, chiefly through an analysis of the discourse of their paratexts in a representative corpus of texts patronized, written, or published by women in Catalan, Portuguese, and Spanish. The key criterion of selection has been the projection of a female voice in public texts, whether via a sobriquet, a real name, grammatical gender, or a pseudonym. However, where appropriate, it has been extended to include also literary correspondence, <b>book</b> <b>inventories,</b> and texts, which despite being published anonymously, {{have been shown to be}} by women. The study is divided into two parts wherein extant sources have been selected and arranged chronologically and by theme, rather than by author. Part I, comprising Chapters 1 and 2, examines the rise and expansion of women’s symbolic capital in the public literary sphere. Part II, comprising Chapters 3 and 4, shows that, by the seventeenth century, women’s literary practices had achieved commercial, professional and didactic renown on both sides of the Atlantic. Chapter 1 shows the rhetorical significance embedded in women’s first metadiscourses, whether in identifiable or anonymous authorship, dating back to the fifteenth century. Chapter 2 illustrates women’s rising literary authority by reviewing their public endeavours and literary self-consciouness in the sixteenth century. Chapter 3 shows the rise of discourses of fame and professionalization in single publications by identifiable female authors, a shift most noticeable in commercial traditions in print (ephemera, the novela and the theatre). Chapter 4 challenges the fallacy that women chose anonymity or hid behind a patron (or publisher) because of their sexual difference. It thus assesses whether the question of women’s literary successes ultimately depended on a negation of their female sex —through publishing anonymously, under a pseudonym, or in the name of a publisher— or was, rather, influenced by their authorial intent, social and religious status. In sum, the thesis shows that women’s sexual difference did not prevent them from gaining a successful and recognized place within the rising Republic of Letters, but was on the contrary turned to their advantage as a promotional point. Women were as important as men as agents in the emergence of the modern concept of the author as independent artist. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Objective – This study {{looks at}} what {{constitutes}} legitimate reading material {{for boys and}} how this material is defined in light of assessed gender differences in reading, and {{is part of a}} larger, ongoing research project on the role of public libraries in the development of youth as readers. Design – Semi‐structured, qualitative interviews and <b>book</b> <b>inventories.</b> Setting – The research originated from the MLIS 566 (Literature for Children and Young Adults) class at the Faculty of Information and Media Studies, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada. Subjects – Forty‐three boys, ages four through twelve, were interviewed. Most of the boys lived in Ontario, although a few came from other Canadian provinces. Methods – Library school students who were registered in a Literature for Children and Young Adults class interviewed children and young adults about their reading and information practice as part of a “Book Ownership Case Study” assignment. The researcher also interviewed children and young adults, for a total of 137 case studies. For the purpose of this article, a data subset for the 43 boys included in the larger project was analyzed. The boys ranged in age from four to twelve years. The mean age was eight and the median age was nine. The theoretical perspective of reader response theory was used to situate the study. This theory has the relationship between the text and the reader as its focus, and it suggests that to understand the reading habits of boys, there needs to be recognition that the experts about their reading are the boys themselves. The interviews, which explored reading preferences and practices, were qualitative, semi‐structured, and took thirty minutes to complete. In addition to the interview, each boy’s personal book and information material collection was inventoried. The researcher used a grounded theory approach to analyze the inventory and interview data to pull out themes related to the research questions. Grounded theory “uses a prescribed set of procedures for analyzing data and constructing a theoretical model” from the data (Leedy and Ormrod 154). Main Results – The collection inventories revealed that all 43 study participants had personal collections of reading materials. The collections ranged from eight volumes to 398 volumes. There was a mean volume total of 108 and a median of 98 books per boy. In addition to books, other materials were in the collections. Video recordings were owned by 36 (83. 7 %) of the boys, 28 (65. 1 %) of participants had computer software, 28 (65. 1 %) owned audio recordings, and 21 (48. 8 %) of the collections also included magazines. In the interview data analysis, a number of themes were revealed. All of the boys except one owned fiction. Some genres appeared frequently and were different than the ones found in the inventories taken of the girls in the larger study. Genres in the boys’ collections included fantasy, science fiction, sports stories, and humorous stories. The boys also discussed genres they did not enjoy: classic children’s fiction, such as The Adventures of Robin Hood, love stories, and “books about groups of girls” (61). All but five boys had series books such as Animorphs, Captain Underpants, Redwall, and Magic Treehouse in their collections. All study participants except for one owned non‐fiction titles. When asked what their favourite book was, many of the boys chose a non‐fiction title. Holdings included subjects such as “jokes, magic, sports, survival guides, crafts, science, dictionaries, maps, nature, and dinosaurs” (62). In addition to books, the boys reported owning and reading a wide range of other materials. Comics, manga, magazines, pop‐up and other toy books, sticker books, colouring books, puzzle books, and catalogues were among the collection inventories. Only one boy read the newspaper. Another theme that emerged from the interview data was “gaming as story” (63). The boys who read video game manuals reported reading to learn about the game, and also reading to experience the game’s story. One boy’s enjoyment of the manual and the game came from the narrative found within. Various reading practices were explored in the interviews. Formats that featured non‐linear reading were popular. Illustrations were important. Pragmatic reading, done to support other activities (e. g., Pokeman), was “both useful and pleasurable” (54). And finally, the issue of what counts as reading emerged from the data. Many boys discounted the reading that “they liked the best as not really being reading” (65). Some of the boys felt that reading novels constituted reading but that the reading of computer manuals or items such as science fair project books was “not really reading” (65). A distinction was made between real books and information books by the boys. Conclusions – The researcher explored what has been labelled as the “problem” of boys reading in this paper. She found that the 43 boys in this study are reading, but what they are reading has been undervalued by society and by the boys themselves. Collection inventories found a large number of non‐fiction books, computer magazines, comic books, graphic novels, and role‐playing game manuals—items not necessarily privileged by libraries, schools, or even by the boys themselves. The researcher suggests that “part of the ‘boys and reading problem’ then lies in what we count as reading” (66). By keeping what boys are actually reading in mind when it comes to collection development and library programming, children’s librarians can “play a central role in legitimizing the reading practices of boys” (66) ...|$|E
