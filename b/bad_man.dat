5|$|In 1955, Cagney {{replaced}} Spencer Tracy on the Western film Tribute to a <b>Bad</b> <b>Man</b> for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He received {{praise for}} his performance, and the studio liked his work enough {{to offer him}} These Wilder Years with Barbara Stanwyck. The two stars got on well; they had both previously worked in vaudeville, and they entertained {{the cast and crew}} off-screen by singing and dancing.|$|E
5|$|MGM lent Tracy to Twentieth Century-Fox for the Western film Broken Lance, {{his only}} {{appearance}} of 1954. The picture was well received. In 1955 Tracy turned down William Wyler's The Desperate Hours because {{he refused to}} take second-billing to Humphrey Bogart. Instead, Tracy appeared as a one-armed protagonist who faces the hostility {{of a small town}} in Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), a film directed by John Sturges. For his work, Tracy received a fifth Oscar nomination and was awarded the Best Actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival. He had personally been unhappy with the picture, and threatened to leave it during production. This behavior became a regular occurrence for the aging Tracy, who was increasingly lethargic and cynical. He began production on Tribute to a <b>Bad</b> <b>Man</b> in the summer of 1955, but pulled out when the location shooting in Colorado gave him altitude sickness. The trouble caused by the picture fractured Tracy's relationship with MGM. In June 1955 he was the last remaining star of the studio's heyday, but with his contract up for renewal—Tracy opted to go independent {{for the first time in}} his movie career.|$|E
25|$|Also on November 26, Crow Neck, a {{returning}} warrior, told <b>Bad</b> <b>Man</b> (also {{known as}} Cranky Man) {{that he had}} left an exhausted horse along the trail to rest. When {{he went back to}} retrieve the horse that day, he saw moving figures to the north who looked like soldiers. Fearful, he turned back without getting his horse. <b>Bad</b> <b>Man</b> doubted Crow Neck had seen soldiers; he said perhaps he had a guilty conscience from having gone against the chiefs' wishes by joining the war party. Crow Neck told no one else what he had seen, fearing that he might be laughed at, or chastised by Black Kettle for having been part of the raid.|$|E

25|$|Although he {{traveled}} and operated his confidence swindles {{all across the}} western United States, he is most famous for having a major hand in the organized criminal operations of Denver and Creede, Colorado, and Skagway, Alaska, from 1879 to 1898. In Denver, he ran several saloons, gambling halls, cigar stores, and auction houses that specialized in cheating their clientele. In Denver, Soapy began {{to make a name}} for himself across the country as a <b>bad</b> <b>man.</b> Denver is also where he entered into the arena of political fixing, where, for favors, he could sway the outcome of city, county, and state elections.|$|E
25|$|Then the debaters {{return to}} their {{previous}} analysis of Pittacus' and Simonides' poetry. On Socrates' interpretation, Pittacus claims {{that it is difficult}} to be a good man, but presumably possible. Simonides, on the other hand, claims that it is impossible to live without ever being a <b>bad</b> <b>man,</b> and even to be a good man on occasion is difficult (344a45d). Simonides praises those who at least do not do wrong willingly. Socrates' interpretation is that, since Simonides was a wise man, he must know that no one does any wrong willingly; accordingly, he must mean that he will willingly praise those who do no wrong, not that some do wrong willingly and others unwillingly, only the latter garnering his praise (345d46b). Socrates thus argues that the authority of Simonides does not stand against his understanding of virtue and whether anyone willingly does wrong.|$|E

500|$|Hanneman was {{inspired}} to write [...] "Angel of Death" [...] after he read {{a number of books}} on Mengele during a Slayer tour. Hanneman has complained people usually misinterpret the lyrics, and clarified: [...] "Nothing I put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was a <b>bad</b> <b>man,</b> because to me— well, isn't that obvious? I shouldn't have to tell you that." [...] The band utilized the controversy to attract publicity, incorporating the Reichsadler into their logo (also the S in the band's name resembles the Sig runes used by the SS), and writing a song in Divine Intervention titled [...] "SS-3", which mentions Reinhard Heydrich, the second in command in the Schutzstaffel.|$|E

Stella later described her father as [...] "a <b>bad</b> <b>man,</b> but a good doctor". He was charitable to his poorer patients and imaginative in finding cures, but made life miserable for his family. Initially Stella was his favourite, {{but by the time}} she reached puberty he frequently mocked her looks and size. Fortunately, her mother was a calm and stabilising influence.

500|$|Morrison {{found that}} the locals whom he spoke to [...] many of whom remembered Murrell from several decades before [...] found the cunning man to be [...] "a white and lawful wizard, who warred against the powers of {{darkness}} with all his might"; they added that it was [...] "no sin to employ the arts of a man like him". Conversely, Maple noted that his research indicated that attitudes toward Murrell varied within the local community. Although many individuals, particularly among the poor, viewed him as a valuable member of the community, others [...] particularly among the wealthier strata of society [...] deemed him to be [...] "a dangerous quack and disseminator of superstitious nonsense". Maple found one woman, Mrs Petchey, who described him as [...] "a smuggler and a <b>bad</b> <b>man.</b> He did things that wouldn't be allowed today - them witchcrafts, I mean. Nowadays, people would say he'd sold his soul to the Devil, wouldn't they? They'd put him away for his witchcrafts." [...] Conversely, Maple noted that Mrs Murrell, who was a descendent of James, described the cunning man as [...] "a good man and a regular churchgoer". According to the folklore obtained by Maple, Murrell would often have debates about Christian theology with a local parson, the Reverend Thomas Espin [...] who had been Professor of Pastoral Theology at Queen's College, Birmingham [...] and that Espin expressed the view that Murrell [...] "knows his Bible better than I do...
