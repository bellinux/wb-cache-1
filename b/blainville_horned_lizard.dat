It {{is often referred to}} as a [...] "horny toad" [...] due to its wide body and blunt snout, but it is not a toad.|$|R
50|$|The Texas <b>horned</b> <b>lizard</b> is the largest-bodied {{and most}} widely {{distributed}} {{of the roughly}} 14 species of <b>horned</b> <b>lizards</b> in the western United States and Mexico. The average Texas <b>horned</b> <b>lizard</b> is 69 mm in snout-vent length, but the upper boundary for males is 94 mm and for females it is 114 mm.|$|R
50|$|The short-tailed <b>horned</b> <b>lizard</b> (Phrynosoma braconnieri) is an {{uncommon}} species of <b>horned</b> <b>lizard</b> endemic to Mexico. It {{has a very}} distinct, shortened tail, which is sometimes not apparent.|$|R
50|$|The Texas <b>horned</b> <b>lizard</b> (Phrynosoma cornutum) is one {{of about}} 14 North American species of spikey-bodied {{reptiles}} called <b>horned</b> <b>lizards.</b> P. cornutum ranges from Colorado and Kansas to northern Mexico (in the Sonoran desert), and from southeastern Arizona to Texas.

5000|$|The rock <b>horned</b> <b>lizard</b> or Ditmars' <b>horned</b> <b>lizard</b> (Phrynosoma ditmarsi) is {{a species}} of phrynosomatid lizard endemic to Sonora in {{northern}} Mexico, south of the Arizona border. Bearing the shortest horns of all the <b>horned</b> <b>lizards,</b> it lives in thorn-scrub and deciduous Sinaloan woodlands. The rock <b>horned</b> <b>lizard</b> was [...] "lost" [...] to science for about 65 years. It has a unique habitat preference and limited distribution. It also had a very imprecise holotype locality record which {{made it difficult to}} locate. An extraordinary effort by Vincent Roth based on a cross-correlational analysis of gut contents from only three specimens led to its rediscovery.|$|R

5000|$|Round-tailed <b>horned</b> <b>lizard,</b> Texas garter snake, Texas <b>horned</b> <b>lizard,</b> Texas long-nosed {{snake and}} Western Massasauga {{are among the}} most {{dominant}} reptiles in the short grass prairie.

Like all <b>lizards,</b> the giant <b>horned</b> <b>lizard</b> is cold-blooded. It is able to survive in the desert. The spines on its back and sides are made from modified scales, whereas the horns on its head are true horns (i.e., they have a bony core).|$|R

40|$|Many {{descriptions}} of evolutionary adapta-tions are criticized as “just-so stories ” (1) {{that are based}} more on intuition than on direct tests of adaptive hypotheses. The elaborate crowns of horns possessed by many species of <b>horned</b> <b>lizards</b> (genus Phrynosoma) are classic examples of intuitively adaptive fea-tures that lack direct tests of function. The bony horns that give <b>horned</b> <b>lizards</b> their name are presumed {{to function as a}} defense against predators (Fig. 1 B). Here we present data from the wild showing that natural se-lection by loggerhead shrikes favors longer horns (fig. S 1) in the flat-tailed <b>horned</b> <b>lizard</b> (Phrynosoma mcalli) ...|$|R
