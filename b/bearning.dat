The crystal packing can be described as alternating zigzag layers of cations parallel to the (001) plane, which are sandwiched by the iodide ions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the study {{carried out in}} the urban area of Sogamoso, in order to document and obtain a diagnosis of the conditions of health and safety at work of people who develop some activities in the limber industry inthis city. All the processes that art part of the production and processing of wood in this industry in this city. All  the processes that art part of the production and processing of wood in this industry are characterized, identified and evaluated. <b>Bearning</b> in mind the parameters and concepts of occupational health, the necessary information was obtained by the same workers, through a survey, which enabled to capture the creation concerning  socio-economic conditions, working conditions of themselves. Diverse dangers were identified and were assessed the occupational risks existing in each of their productive activities using the GTC 45, 2012. All this allowed defining a series of activies and proposals for improvement, applicable to this type of companies that, if they are welcomed, would mitigate all the shortcomings identified in this research, contribuiting to a better quality of life workers, greater competitiveness and productivity in the timber industry in Sogamoso...|$|E
40|$|It is {{becoming}} reality that robots act {{in our living}} life environment in recent years. Not only in special environment as like factory but also in our daily living office buildings, robots are working without disturbing us. It is important for robot to know environment around itself, {{in order to move}} around us safely especially at such conditions. Ultrasonic sensor {{is one of the most}} popular external sensor among various external sensors for mobile robots. A pulse-echo method which transmit a pulse and measure deistance using time-of-flight is often used for mobile robot ultrasonic sensor. However, it is difficult to measure accurate bearing angle because of its wide beam width. On the other hand, the reflecting objects in indoor environment can be considered as specular in regard to an ultrasonic wave length in the air. When ultrasound reflect specularly, an area corresponding to a leading edge of an echo is assumed as a point. Consequently, if it is possible to improve bearing measurement accuracy, the ultrasonic sensor can measure the reflecting point. The reflecting point shows special feature of the environment, for example position of corner or bearing angle of wall, which are quantitative information. It is very useful for environment recognition of mobile robots to detect those reflecting points which show such information accurately. In a word, it is really important to develop accurate direction measurable ultrasonic sensor for mobile tobots. Moreover, simplicity and real-time operation are also important to use it for moving mobile robots. Purpose of this reaserch is the development of highly efficient ultrasonic sensors for indoor mobile robots environment recognition. Especially, it emphasized to improve a weak point of ultrasonic sensor, bad bearing accuracy, without injuring merit, fast measurement speed. For this purpose, fast and accurate reflecting points measurement method are proposed, and their usefulness are confirmed by actual proofs on mobile robots in this research. ･･･Thesis (Ph.
