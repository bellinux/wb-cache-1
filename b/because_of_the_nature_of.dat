5|$|Although the edibility of S.amygdalinus is {{not known}} with certainty, {{authorities}} often recommend to avoid consuming blue-staining, red-pored boletes, as several are poisonous. The species was implicated in one group of poisonings in California in 1996–97, but <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the symptoms experienced, there was probably more than one type of mushroom consumed.|$|E
5|$|The Medal of Honor {{was created}} during the American Civil War {{and is the}} highest {{military}} decoration presented by the United States government {{to a member of}} its armed forces. Recipients must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} in action against an enemy of the United States. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> this medal, it is commonly presented posthumously.|$|E
5|$|Though Kikai {{started to}} {{photograph}} in Asakusa {{simply because it}} was near where he then lived, he has continued <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the place and its visitors. Once a bustling and fashionable area, Asakusa long ago lost this status. If it were as popular and crowded {{as it was before}} the war, Kikai says, he would go somewhere else.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{activities}} <b>of</b> commissioned {{agents were}} strengthened <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> and social {{attitudes and values}} in Sakkwato.

5|$|Local {{opinion was}} heavily against Thornton. Pamphlets were sold {{purporting}} to show Thornton's guilt, and poems were composed {{with the same}} theme. The defendant's solicitor complained of these, alleging it {{made it hard to}} find an unbiased jury. On 8 August 1817, people filled {{the street in front of}} County Hall in Warwick, where the trial was to take place. When the judge, Sir George Sowley Holroyd (a justice of the Court of King's Bench) began proceedings at 8a.m., people rushed to fill the available seating, and the public benches remained full throughout the one-day trial. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the evidence, women were not permitted to witness the trial.|$|E
5|$|The North Somerset Levels are to {{the east}} of Weston-super-Mare, while the Axe valley is {{separated}} by the Isle of Wedmore from the Brue valley. The latter is separated by the Polden Hills from the main wetland of the Parrett/Tone/Cary valleys. The Poldens are a low narrow ridge of Blue Lias with alternating bands of limestone and clay. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the Levels and Moors, the Poldens have a significant visual impact.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} side of the hill was a shallow creek (Burnett Creek), and on the east side a very steep embankment. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the position, Harrison did not order {{temporary}} works to be created around the position, as was ordinarily done by encamped armies. The Yellow Jacket company, with Captain Spier Spencer in command, was posted on the southern end of the camp perimeter. The rest of the militia formed a rectangular formation along the edges of the bluff surrounding the camp. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Bartholomew commanded the Indiana militia units guarding the steep bluff on the eastern side of the formation. The regulars, commanded by Major Floyd, and the dragoons, commanded by Maj. Joseph Daveiss and former congressman Capt. Benjamin Parke, were kept behind the main line in reserve.|$|E

25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> its work, ASIO {{does not}} make details of its {{activities}} public and law prevents the identities of ASIO officers from being disclosed. ASIO and the Australian Government say that operational measures ensuring the legality of ASIO operations have been established.|$|E
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the {{information}} passing through continuous auditing systems, security and privacy issues {{are also being}} addressed. Data assurance techniques, as well as access control mechanisms and policies are being implemented into CA systems to prevent unauthorized access and manipulation, and CCM can help test these controls.|$|E
50|$|An {{equipment}} room can house telecommunication installations that serves <b>the</b> occupants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building or multiple buildings in a campus environment. An {{equipment room}} is considered distinct from a telecommunications room {{because it is}} considered to be a building or campus serving (as opposed to floor serving) facility and <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> or complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equipment that it contains.|$|R

25|$|Ultra- or super- short base line, USBL or SSBL. This {{works as}} {{described}} above. Because the {{angle to the}} transponder is measured, a correction {{needs to be made}} for the ship's roll and pitch. These are determined by Motion Reference Units. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> angle measurement, the accuracy deteriorates with increasing water depth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the HTPC, {{higher than}} average {{capacities}} are required for HTPC units to allow storage of pictures, music, television shows, videos, and other multimedia. Designed almost as a 'permanent storage' device, space can quickly run out on these devices. Because of restrictions on internal space for hard disk drives and a desire for low noise levels, many HTPC units utilize a NAS (Network Attached Storage) device, or another type of network connected file server.|$|E
25|$|Karnaugh {{maps are}} useful for {{detecting}} and eliminating race conditions. Race hazards are very easy to spot using a Karnaugh map, because a race condition may exist when moving between any pair of adjacent, but disjoint, regions circumscribed on the map. However, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> Gray coding, adjacent has a special definition explained above - we're in fact moving on a torus, rather than a rectangle, wrapping around the top, bottom, and the sides.|$|E
50|$|Het Gooi {{has become}} heavily populated. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> in <b>the</b> area and its {{historic}} charm, the villages have become {{attractive to the}} affluent, including retirees. The population is relatively older {{and there are many}} old-age homes. <b>The</b> original inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area have been submerged by <b>the</b> flood <b>of</b> newcomers. <b>The</b> local dialect that used to be spoken here has virtually disappeared.|$|R

25|$|Jinx {{returns in}} the 2004 direct-to-video {{animated}} film , voiced by Venus Terzo. Her original background with the Blind Master is not mentioned, instead she is training along with Kamakura under Snake Eyes, and likes to rib Kamakura for his lesser experience. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the movie, {{it is hard}} to determine if she is an apprentice for the first time, or is learning a new level of skills, as she does seem to be a very seasoned ninja.|$|E
25|$|Married {{people who}} form {{relations}} with extramarital partners {{or people who}} engage in relations with partners married to somebody else may be subjected to violence in these relations. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> adulteryillicit or illegal in many societiesthis type of intimate partner violence may go underreported {{or may not be}} prosecuted when it is reported; and in some jurisdictions this type of violence is not covered by the specific domestic violence laws meant to protect persons in 'legitimate' couples.|$|E
25|$|Chester Carlson (1906–1968), the {{inventor}} of xerography, offered further financial help. Tucker writes that this allowed Stevenson to step down {{as chair of the}} psychiatry department and set up a separate division within the department, which he called the Division of Personality Studies, later renamed the Division of Perceptual Studies. When Carlson died in 1968, he left $1,000,000 to the University of Virginia to continue Stevenson's work. The bequest caused controversy within the university <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the research, but the donation was accepted, and Stevenson became the first Carlson Professor of Psychiatry.|$|E
50|$|Emission {{spectroscopy}} {{is often}} referred to as optical emission spectroscopy <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> what is being emitted.|$|R

50|$|That {{will either}} be {{some form of}} dialysis, which can be done at least two {{different}} ways at varying frequencies and durations (whether it is done {{at home or in}} the clinic depends on the method used and the patient's stability and training) and eventually, if they are eligible <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> and severity <b>of</b> their condition and if a suitable match can be found, unilateral or bilateral kidney transplantation.|$|R
25|$|Non-medical use of {{fentanyl}} {{by individuals}} without opiate tolerance {{can be very}} dangerous and has resulted in numerous deaths. Even those with opiate tolerances {{are at high risk}} for overdoses. Once the fentanyl is in the user's system, it is extremely difficult to stop its course <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> absorption. Illicitly synthesized fentanyl powder has also appeared on the United States market. Because of the extremely high strength of pure fentanyl powder, {{it is very difficult to}} dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, therefore, very dangerous.|$|E
25|$|Not all of {{that energy}} can be {{utilized}} by any realistic propulsion technology <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the annihilation products. While electron–positron reactions result in gamma ray photons, these are difficult to direct and use for thrust. In reactions between protons and antiprotons, their energy is converted largely into relativistic neutral and charged pions. The neutral pions decay almost immediately (with a lifetime of 85 attoseconds) into high-energy photons, but the charged pions decay more slowly (with a lifetime of 26 nanoseconds) and can be deflected magnetically to produce thrust.|$|E
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the {{recording}} medium, playback of many cylinders can cause degradation of {{the recording}}. The replay of cylinders diminishes their fidelity and degrades their recorded signals. Additionally, when exposed to humidity, mold can penetrate cylinders' surface and cause the recordings to have surface noise. Currently, the only professional machine manufactured for the playback of cylinder recordings is the Archéophone player, designed by Henri Chamoux. The Archéophone {{is used by the}} Edison National Historic Site, Bowling Green State University (Bowling Green, Ohio), The Department of Special Collections, Donald C Davidson Library at The University of California, Santa Barbara, and many other libraries and archives.|$|E
