50|$|In the 1920s, Walter Stanley Stiles, a young {{physicist}} at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, England, {{examined the effects}} of street lighting and headlight features on automobile traffic accidents, which were becoming increasingly prevalent at the time. Stiles, along with his fellow National Physical Laboratory researcher Brian Hewson Crawford, set out to measure the effect of light intensity on pupil size. They constructed an apparatus where two independently controlled beams, both emitted by the same light source, entered the eye: a narrow beam {{through the center of the}} pupil, and a wider <b>beam</b> <b>filling</b> the whole pupil. The two beams alternated in time, and the subject was instructed to adjust the intensity of the wider beam until minimum flicker was observed, thus minimizing the difference in the visual stimulus between to the two beams. It was observed that the luminance of the pupil is not proportional to the pupil area. For instance, the luminance of a 30 mm2 pupil was found to be only twice that of a 10 mm2 pupil. In other words, to match the apparent brightness of light entering a 30 mm2 pupil, the luminance of light entering through a 10 mm2 pupil had to be increased by a factor of two, instead of the expected factor of three.|$|E
40|$|Estimating {{rain rate}} from {{environmental}} microwave emissions is hampered by several difficulties. One of these difficulties {{is known as}} the beam-filling effect. <b>Beam</b> <b>filling</b> is the systematic error introduced when the microwave radiometer's field of view is not filled with uniform rain. <b>Beam</b> <b>filling</b> can have dramatic effects on rain-rate estimation, causing rain rates to be underestimated by as much as a factor of 2. The present study derives an approximate expression for <b>beam</b> <b>filling</b> that provides, in principle, a way to estimate this effect. In addition, this study deals only with single-channel microwave rain estimation over the ocean. The final results reveal that <b>beam</b> <b>filling</b> is essentially determined by the freezing level, the mean fraction of the footprint raining, and the footprint-averaged rain rate. Also, the numerical results appear to agree with other empirical studies. Furthermore, the analysis brings to light an interesting connection with rain threshold techniques for estimating area-averaged rain rates...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} of rain rates retrieved from the Nimbus 5 electronically scanning microwave radiometer brightness temperatures and observed from shipboard radars during the Global Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE) phase I {{shows that the}} <b>beam</b> <b>filling</b> error is {{the major source of}} discrepancy between the two. When averaged over a large scene (the GATE radar array, 400 km in diameter), the <b>beam</b> <b>filling</b> error is quite stable, being 50 percent of the observed rain rate.

A statistical model of the <b>beam</b> <b>filling</b> error is developed by envisioning an idealized instrument field-of-view that encompasses an entire gamma distribution of rain rates. A modeled correction factor near 2 is found for rain rate and temperature characteristics consistent with GATE conditions. The statistical model also suggests that the correction factor varies from 1. 5 to 2. 5 for suppressed to enhanced tropical convective regimes, and decreases to 1. 5 as the freezing level and average depth of the rain column decreases to 2. 5 km...|$|E

40|$|Algorithms for {{estimating}} precipitation {{rates from}} spaceborne radar observations of apparent radar reflectivity depend on attenuation correction procedures. The algorithm suite for the Ku-band precipitation radar aboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite {{is one such}} example.

Empirical tests conducted using ground-based radar observations in the current simulation study show that decorrelation effects are evident in tilted convective cells.

An evaluation of a spaceborne three-frequency Ku-/Ka-/W-band radar system is presented in this study, based on modeling radar reflectivities from the results of a global cloud-resolving model with a 875 m grid spacing. To produce the reflectivities, a scattering model has been developed for each of the hydrometeor types produced by the model, as well as for melting snow. The effects of attenuation and multiple scattering on the radar signal are modeled using a radiative transfer model, while nonuniform <b>beam</b> <b>filling</b> is reproduced with spatial averaging. The combined effects of these are then quantified both globally and in six localized case studies. Two different orbital scenarios using the same radar are compared. Overall, based on the results, it is expected that the proposed radar would detect a high-quality signal in most clouds and precipitation. The main exceptions are the thinnest clouds that are below the detection threshold of the W-band channel, and {{at the opposite end of}} the scale, heavy convective rainfall where a combination of attenuation, multiple scattering and nonuniform <b>beam</b> <b>filling</b> commonly cause significant deterioration of the signal; thus, while the latter can be generally detected, the quality of the retrievals is likely to be degraded...|$|E

Different foam-filled AZ 31 B beams with {{a variation of}} foam density (0. 05 g/cm 3, 0. 20 g/cm 3 and 0. 30 g/cm 3) were fabricated through several manufacturing processes: cold bending, tungsten inert gas welding, cathodic dip painting and polyurethane foam injection. It was found that 0. 20 g/cm 3 and 0. 30 g/cm 3 foams stabilised the cross sections of the thin-walled AZ 31 B beams and no inward folds occurred during the bending process, which resulted in significantly higher load carrying capacity than the empty beam. A nonlinear non-monotonic relationship between the specific energy absorption and the foam density was found for the foam-filled AZ 31 B beams. The AZ 31 B <b>beam</b> <b>filled</b> with 0. 20 g/cm 3 foam reached the highest specific energy absorption; moreover, it absorbed nearly 33 % more energy and reached nearly 2. 9 times higher specific energy absorption than the foam-filled DC 04 <b>beam</b> <b>filled</b> with the same foam, although the former one was nearly 54 % lighter. This outperformance is associated to the high work hardening rate of AZ 31 B in compression, where more material is involved in plastic deformation. However, the foam-filled AZ 31 B beams tend to fracture at the compression and tension walls, because the foam exhibits brittle fracture behaviour in tension and AZ 31 B exhibits low ductility in compression and plane-strain conditions, which limits their energy absorption at a larger deflection...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{concerns}} {{the assessment of}} the performance of the upcoming Earth Cloud Aerosols Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) Doppler cloud profiling radar in convection. Spaceborne Doppler radar data are simulated starting from high-resolution CRM model data, through forward Monte Carlo simulation from which the voltage signals as sampled by specific radar configuration are generated. Until the launch of Earth- CARE in 2016, simulations are the only means of assessing the impact of EarthCAREs configuration on the accuracy of the Doppler products (reflectivity and mean Doppler velocity). Two of the main contributors to EC-CPR total error budget are the multiple scattering and non-uniform <b>beam</b> <b>filling</b> effect errors, which can be mitigated using methods described in the thesis. However, for Earth- CARE radar using the conventional pulse pair technique, the scientific requirement for accuracy of 1 m/s at 1 km integration of Doppler velocity cannot be met for deep convective systems, even if the correction methods are applied. The thesis then focuses on six polarization diversity radar systems, three for W-band (94 GHz) and three for Ka-band (35 GHz). After the correction methods are applied for MS and NUBF effects, the accuracy of 1 m/s for 500 m integration is possible for all W-band configurations assessed. This includes relatively small antennas of 2. 5 m currently being implemented in space. Consequently, two key results for measurements in deep convection can be drawn for future radar concept design. Firstly, the large antenna will help to minimize the effects of non-uniform <b>beam</b> <b>filling</b> and multiple scattering.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe continuing {{development of the}} free electron laser (FEL) as a powerful and versatile source of coherent radiation steadily drives toward the goal of high efficiency and broad tenability at shorter wavelengths. New experiments provide significant data and insight for analysis by theoreticians and experimentalists. Two important areas to study are about electron pulse effects, and the dynamics of optical mode distortion by intense electron beam currents. The initial part of this thesis examines {{one aspect of the}} projected task of FEL application as a military weapon. The advantages of the FEL over other directed energy sources are detailed, as well as the challenge presented by the effects of the marine atmosphere to high energy laser propagation. The remainder of this thesis examines several effects of long wavelength FELs. Chapter IV examines the proposed parameters of the CEBAF IR FEL, and the analysis leads to predictions describing system performance. Chapter V examines the effects of single pass optical mode distortion for FELs with narrow electron beams. Single-mode theory states that gain is proportional to the product of electron beam current and filling factor, but three dimensional simulations show that gain is a function of electron <b>beam</b> <b>filling</b> factor alone. Also examined is a phenomenon of destructive interference of light in the FEL undulator. Chapter VI extends the analysis of the relationship of gain and beam size to include multiple passes of laser light through the laser resonator.
