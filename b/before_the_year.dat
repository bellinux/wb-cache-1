In 1774, he accompanied his sister Clotilde to Chambéry on the journey to meet her bridegroom Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Piedmont, heir to the throne of Sardinia. In 1775, he visited Lyon and also his spinster aunts Adélaïde and Victoire while they were taking the waters at Vichy. The four provincial tours that Louis Stanislas took <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 1791 amounted to a total of three months.|$|E

5|$|The British press {{unanimously}} {{agreed that}} Arsenal were fortunate to win; Wenger himself admitted so in {{his press conference}} afterwards. A television audience of over 480million worldwide watched the final; in the United Kingdom, coverage of the match peaked at 12.8million, making it the highest-rated game in Cup history since the 1996 final. The departures of captains Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> end, coupled with the changing objectives of both clubs, meant the 2005 final is considered as the natural end point in the rivalry between Arsenal and Manchester United under Ferguson and Wenger.|$|E

5|$|The {{west coast}} of Ireland, Lahinch and Donegal Bay in particular, have popular surfing beaches, being fully exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, {{creating}} good surf, especially in winter. Since just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 2010, Bundoran has hosted European championship surfing. Scuba diving is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard. There are also many shipwrecks {{along the coast of}} Ireland, with some of the best wreck dives being in Malin Head and off the County Cork coast.|$|E

5|$|Afforestation {{projects}} have been undertaken to prevent groundwater pollution, secure drinking water, sequester CO2, increase biodiversity, create an attractive countryside, provide easy access to nature and offer outdoor activities to the public. In 2000 the first project, the New Forests of Aarhus, was completed which aimed to double the forest cover in the municipality and in 2009 another phase was announced to double forest cover once more <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 2030. The afforestation plans were realised as a local project in collaboration with private landowners, under a larger national agenda. Other projects to expand natural habitats include a rewilding effort in Geding-Kasted Bog and continuous monitoring of the four Natura 2000 areas in the municipality.|$|E
5|$|At the {{procession}} to George's lying in state in Westminster Hall {{part of the}} Imperial State Crown fell from {{on top of the}} coffin and landed in the gutter as the cortège turned into New Palace Yard. The new king, Edward VIII, saw it fall and wondered whether it was a bad omen for his new reign. As a mark of respect to their father, George's four surviving sons, Edward, Albert, Henry, and George, mounted the guard, known as the Vigil of the Princes, at the catafalque on the night before the funeral. The vigil was not repeated until the death of George's daughter-in-law, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, in 2002. George V was interred at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 28 January 1936. Edward abdicated <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> was out, leaving his brother Albert, Duke of York, to ascend the throne (taking the regnal name George VI).|$|E

Following these consultations, and shortly after assuming the presidency, Kagame launched an ambitious programme of national development called Vision 2020. The major purposes of the programme were to unite the Rwandan people and to transform Rwanda from a highly impoverished into a middle income country. The programme consists of a list of goals which the government aims to achieve <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 2020.

5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E
5|$|The British instigated a new {{offensive}} on 25 September, at Loos, {{to coincide}} with French offensives in the Champagne and Artois regions. The King's were represented in the offensive by eight battalions, from standard infantry to pioneers. Some 150 tons of Chlorine gas was used {{on the first day}} of the battle, discharged via thousands of cylinders. Strong winds blew the gas backwards, hindering the advance of the 1st King's and other units having to also contend with partially uncut barbed wire. The advance of the 1/9th King's also stalled, though they took about 300 Germans prisoner. The battalion later assisted in the repulse of a German counter-attack on 8 October. More battalions arrived <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> ended, including the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th Liverpool Pals, which formed the 89th Brigade, 30th Division.|$|E

25|$|According to Silva Lake, textual critic, it {{is hardly}} to prove it have been written earlier than the year 1000, and is perhaps {{as late as the}} middle of the {{eleventh}} century. This assessment was based rather on the textual dependency from other manuscript, members of the family Π, than on the palaeographical ground (variations of letter forms). According to Silva codex 1219 represents text of the family Π in its earlier stage than Codex Cyprius. Cyprius could be copied from the codex 1219 (Gregory-Aland) or copy of codex 1219 (Lake's hypothetical codex b). Codex 1219 can hardly have written <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 980 or long after 990, in result Codex Cyprius can hardly be dated very long <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 1000.|$|E
