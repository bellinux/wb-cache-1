500|$|A {{symposium}} titled [...] "Supersonic-Transport Implications" [...] was {{hosted by}} the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1960. Various views were put forward on the likely type of powerplant for a supersonic transport, such as podded or buried installation and turbojet or ducted-fan engines. Boundary layer management in the podded installation was put forward as simpler with only an inlet cone <b>but</b> <b>Dr.</b> Seddon of the RAE saw [...] "a future in a more sophisticated integration of shapes" [...] in a buried installation. Another concern highlighted the case with two or more engines [...] situated behind a single intake. An intake failure {{could lead to a}} double or triple engine failure. The advantage of the ducted fan over the turbojet was reduced airport noise but with considerable economic penalties with its larger cross-section producing excessive drag. At that time it was considered that the noise from a turbojet optimised for supersonic cruise could be reduced to an acceptable level using noise suppressors as used on subsonic jets.|$|E
500|$|Joel Brind, {{a faculty}} member at Baruch College in the Department of Natural Sciences, is the primary {{advocate}} of an abortionbreast cancer ("ABC") link.

Brind found that his lobbying efforts were not taken seriously because he had not published his findings in the peer-reviewed medical literature. He therefore collaborated with two anti-abortion physicians and a statistician to publish a 1996 article in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, arguing that induced abortion was a risk factor for breast cancer. The statistician who collaborated with Brind later stated of their findings: [...] "I have some doubts. I don't think the issue has been resolved. When {{we were talking about the}} conclusions, he [...] wanted to make the strongest statements. I tried to temper them a little bit, <b>but</b> <b>Dr.</b> Brind is very adamant about his opinion." ...|$|E

The lighter main battery, compared to other pre-dreadnought type battleships that typically carried twice as many heavy guns, was criticized by some observers, <b>but</b> <b>Dr.</b> Philip Alger writing in Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute noted that [...] "it should be borne in mind that a pair of guns in a turret do not make twice as good shooting as a single gun," [...] and that given the limited displacement of the design, it [...] "was the wisest choice that could be made." [...] Fire control for the guns was provided by Barr and Stroud rangefinders mounted on the conning tower.
