500|$|Henderson {{would not}} accept {{the end of his}} major league career. In May 2005, he was still insisting that he was capable of playing in the major leagues. NBC and ESPN {{reported}} that Henderson had announced his much-delayed official retirement on December 6, 2005, but his agent denied the report the following day. On February 10, 2006, he accepted a position as a hitting instructor for the Mets, while leaving the door open to returning as a player. In July 2006, Henderson discussed an offer he'd received to rejoin the SurfDawgs for the 2006 season, which would have been his 31st in professional baseball, but suggested he'd had enough. But six weeks later, on August 11, he claimed [...] "It's sort of weird not to be playing, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to take a year off", adding, [...] "I can't say I will retire. My heart is still in it... I still love the game right now, so I'm going to wait it out and see what happens." ...|$|E

[...] I didn't fully {{understand}} what he meant <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to ease the rudder lest it bang against the stops and get stuck. I was a little late but in time enough to keep the rudder from jamming. There was a jolt as the rudder hit the stop, but it was light enough so there was no jamming.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} ten, Parsons was {{enrolled}} in Miss Chapin's school for girls in New York. She remained at the Chapin School for five years but was a mediocre student who was easily bored. In 1913, Parsons visited the Armory show, the International Exhibition of Modern Art. She was delighted and inspired by what she saw and described this pivotal moment years later: [...] "It was exciting, full of color and life. I felt like those paintings. I couldn't explain it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> then {{that this was the}} world I wanted... art." [...] Although her parents disapproved, she soon began studying art in the studio of Gutzon Borglum, whom she described as a poor teacher.|$|E
2500|$|During production, {{management}} booked {{dates for}} the band's upcoming European tour. This proved {{a problem for}} Thomas as he felt the album needed more songs. Thomas recalls, [...] "They had an incredible momentum building and were gaining fans all the time. There was an audience waiting for the product, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that they didn't have the right songs yet". Thomas persuaded primary songwriters Hutchence and Andrew to fly to Hong Kong (where Hutchence and drummer Jon Farriss owned an apartment) to write more material for Kick. While waiting for a cab {{to go to the}} airport to fly to Hong Kong, Andrew thought up the famous guitar riff for [...] "Need You Tonight". He told the cab driver to wait a couple of minutes while {{he went back to his}} motel room to grab something. In fact, he went back record the riff on cassette. The cab driver was furious when Andrew returned to the cab forty-five minutes later. When Hutchence heard the demo in Hong Kong, he began to write the song's lyrics, penning them in just ten minutes.|$|E
2500|$|At age 22, Sondheim had {{finished}} the four shows requested by Hammerstein. Julius and Philip Epstein's Front Porch in Flatbush, unproduced at the time, was being shopped around by Lemuel (Lem) Ayers. Ayers approached Frank Loesser and another composer, who turned him down. Ayers and Sondheim met as ushers at a wedding, and Ayers commissioned Sondheim for three songs for the show; Julius Epstein flew in from California and hired Sondheim, {{who worked with him}} in California for four or five months. After eight auditions for backers, half the money needed was raised. The show, retitled Saturday Night, was intended to open during the 1954–55 Broadway season; however, Ayers died of leukemia in his early forties. The rights transferred to his widow, Shirley, and due to her inexperience the show did not continue as planned; it opened off-Broadway in 2000. Sondheim later said, [...] "I don't have any emotional reaction to Saturday Night at all – except fondness. It's not bad stuff for a 23-year-old. There are some things that embarrass me so much in the lyrics – the missed accents, the obvious jokes. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided,</b> leave it. It's my baby pictures. You don't touch up a baby picture – you're a baby!" ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Tumble and Fall", {{the third}} track on Pushing the Senses, {{was chosen as}} its lead single, because their European label Play it Again Sam (PIAS), were getting more {{involved}} with the band, believing the song would be a crossover to make them successful in Europe after touring with Coldplay in 2003. The single became the band's most successful single release since [...] "Buck Rogers", reaching the top five in the UK. Grant claimed that [...] "Tumble and Fall" [...] is a love song, but can be interpreted in any way. In an interview with Feederweb, Grant said of the song: [...] "Again {{this is about the}} ups and downs of life. Its about life in general and how you deal with it. It covers the journey of life and how you have to take the ups with the downs. I wasn’t going to record this song. It took me a long time to finish it, to be happy with it, because the song went through various stages. I wasn’t sure if we really needed a tune like that on the album. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to go to the studio to record an acoustic version just to see what happened and that’s how the song started. It was a completely one take vocal, live with the acoustic guitar and we built everything else around it. It is an acoustic track that grew into what it is now. So that was the only song that we recorded like that on the album, so it is a bit different for that reason and is probably why it has an organic feel to it".|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes--that {{was what}} I was afraid of! <b>But</b> <b>I</b> had <b>decided</b> {{not to write}} to you any more. They won't have me back at the school--that's why I couldn't write. Not the fact, but the reason!" ...|$|R

5000|$|As a math {{professor}} at Carroll College for 25 years, Topel was an unlikely pick {{to become a}} bishop.

[...] "I didn't have a bound script ready for the sequel, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> had <b>decided</b> to continue the sequel with Vallaba's character that you see in Thegidi. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> this while working on the film".|$|R

5000|$|On 25 July 2010, Guti left Real Madrid {{after nearly}} 25 years of service. He said: [...] "I have {{an offer from}} Beşiktaş JK, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> haven't <b>decided</b> yet".
