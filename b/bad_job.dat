5|$|During a {{party at}} the {{community}} centre, Fatboy smuggles in alcohol and kisses Denise Fox (Diane Parish), angering her husband Lucas (Don Gilet), who throws Fatboy out and begins angrily preaching to him. This causes Fatboy to argue with Mercy. During the argument, Mercy pushes him and he falls onto a tree in the Square's gardens planted in memory of Lucas's ex-wife Trina (Sharon Duncan Brewster), snapping it. Fatboy enlists the help of Mercy, Leon and ZsaZsa to replace it, but as they dig it up, they uncover a dead body, that of Denise's ex-husband Owen Turner (Lee Ross), who Lucas murdered eight months previously. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy and to cheer her up, they play rounders. However, they smash Dot Branning's (June Brown) window and she makes Fatboy fix it. He does a <b>bad</b> <b>job</b> so she insists he pay for a professional, asking Fatboy to wait in her house for the professional to arrive. While he waits, he plays dominoes with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) and when Dot returns, she is impressed with Fatboy's politeness when he offers to clean the new window and make her a cup of tea.|$|E

The writers wanted to explore what made Flanders tick and examine what made him act the way he does. The original idea came from George Meyer, who had also wanted an episode about Flanders' faith being tested. One of the key story points came from his friend Jack Handey, {{a writer for}} Saturday Night Live, who wanted to do a sketch about a down-on-his-luck shoemaker who is visited by elves who help him, but make very bad shoes. Likewise, it inspired the idea that the neighbors would rebuild Flanders' house, but do a <b>bad</b> <b>job</b> and provoke an outburst.|$|E

In reviewing the film for DVD Talk, film instructor and critic Justin Felix found the use of a real tiger one of the only original elements of the film, while feeling the plot, setting, and characters followed the set Sci Fi Channel movie of the week formula. At the same time, he notes that the use of a live tiger results in most attacks occurring off screen and the tiger being rarely seen at all, taking away the [...] "usual" [...] fun of laughing at badly done [...] "CG terrors."

[...] While he felt the character of Colonel Graham was contrived and seemed to come from another era, Swindoll did think Ian D. Clark did portray the character decently.

2500|$|Behavioral Checklists and Scales: {{behaviors}} are more definite than traits. [...] The critical incidents method (or critical incident technique) concerns [...] "specific behaviors indicative of good or <b>bad</b> <b>job</b> performance". [...] Supervisors record behaviors {{of what they}} judge to be job performance relevant, and they keep a running tally of good and bad behaviors. [...] A discussion on performance may then follow. [...] The behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS) combine the critical incidents method with rating scale methods by rating performance on a scale but with the scale points being anchored by behavioral incidents. [...] Note that BARS are job specific. In the behavioral observation scale (BOS) approach to performance appraisal, employees are also evaluated {{in the terms of}} critical incidents. In that respect, it is similar to BARS. However, the BOS appraisal rate subordinates on the frequency of the critical incidents as they are observed to occur over a given period. The ratings are assigned on a five-point scale. The behavioral incidents for the rating scale are developed {{in the same way as}} for BARS through identification by supervisors or other subject matter experts. Similarly, BOS techniques meet equal employment opportunity because they are related to actual behavior required for successful job performance.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{people do}} not oppose the IVF {{practice}} itself (i.e. the creating of a pregnancy through [...] "artificial" [...] ways) but are {{highly critical of the}} current state of the present day industry. Such individuals argue that the industry has now become a multibillion-dollar industry, which is widely unregulated and prone to serious abuses in the desire of practitioners to obtain profit. For instance, in 2008, a California physician transferred 12 embryos to a woman who gave birth to octuplets (see Suleman octuplets). This has made international news, and had led to accusations that many doctors are willing to seriously endanger the health and even life of women in order to gain money. Robert Winston, professor of fertility studies at Imperial College London, had called the industry [...] "corrupt" [...] and [...] "greedy" [...] saying that [...] "One of the major problems facing us in healthcare is that IVF has become a massive commercial industry," [...] and that [...] "What has happened, of course, is that money is corrupting this whole technology", and accused authorities of failing to protect couples from exploitation [...] "The regulatory authority has done a consistently <b>bad</b> <b>job.</b> It's not prevented the exploitation of women, it's not put out very good information to couples, it's not limited the number of unscientific treatments people have access to". The IVF industry can thus be seen as an example of what social scientists are describing as an increasing trend towards a market-driven construction of health, medicine and the human body.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theory {{in which the}} composition of jobs is always sub-optimal, we use a search framework which is a natural tool to model {{a situation in which}} identical workers can end up in different jobs with very different compensation patterns.

There will naturally exist good and <b>bad</b> <b>jobs</b> in this economy. Second, establish that in an unregulated market, the composition of jobs is in efficiently biased towards <b>bad</b> <b>jobs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Much debate exists about postbureaucratic {{organizational}} {{forms that}} are sometimes felt {{to strengthen the}} polarization between good and <b>bad</b> <b>jobs.</b> Small firms provide one test in that they lack bureaucracy. Such firms from two contrasting sectors, food manufacture and the media, are used to assess, respectively, the models of good and <b>bad</b> <b>jobs.</b> Data from 66 firms and 203 employees show a mixed picture: Food <b>jobs</b> are <b>bad</b> for pay but relatively good for autonomy. Media jobs offer autonomy, but this is constrained by tight performance demands and low pay. These results help to explain why national surveys find no polarization in terms of autonomy and are explained by the economic contingencies of the two sectors. Ordinariness rather than stark polarization is the key picture...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} novel {{evidence on}} the long-term effect of the Great Recession {{on the quality of}} jobs, in particular whether the Great Recession results in the replacement of good jobs (characterized by high wage/benefit, job security, and opportunity for training and development) with <b>bad</b> <b>jobs</b> (characterized by the lack of such attributes). Unfortunately there is not yet sufficiently long data from the recent Great Recession that enable researchers to study fully its long-term consequences for the labor market structure. To this end, we examine Japan's Lost Decade, the original Great Recession that occurred two decades ago. First, insofar as male workers are concerned, we find evidence against the popular narrative that during Japan's Lost Decade there was a significant shift of the composition of employment toward <b>bad</b> <b>jobs.</b> Second, we find that the composition of female workers shifted significantly toward <b>bad</b> <b>jobs</b> and that such a shift occurred primarily through an increased use of a hybrid employment contract of nonstandard employment with indefinite contracts. Third, young women in Japan made considerable progress in shifting the composition of their employment toward good jobs during Japan's growth decade preceding the Lost Decade. We find that such progress was entirely undone during the Great Recession. Obviously the Great Recession affects the quantity of jobs and policy makers ought to pay immediate attention to such quantity effects. However, the Great Recession may also have more long-term structural effects on the quality of jobs...|$|R
40|$|We analyse {{back to work}} {{incentives}} {{taking into}} account intertemporal gains and worker mobility between jobs. Theoretically, we show that these incentives {{vary depending on the}} difference between replacement benefits and <b>bad</b> <b>jobs</b> wages. They are also sensible to the accessibility and stability of good jobs and to the wage inequality between good and <b>bad</b> <b>jobs.</b> The fact is all these factors are diverse among social groups. Facing this kind of diversity, we present an illustrative simulation based on Labor Force French Survey, which suggests that mixing policies {{is the best way to}} improve back to work incentives. For instance, one have to make jobs more stable to improve employment gains for unskilled young men, but it is better to improve good job accessibility for the skilled young women and for unskilled adults and we need to use all the chanels for the young unskilled women.

30|$|This result {{indicates}} that government policy aiming to increase labor mobility {{can be very}} effective in improving labor market outcomes. However, the efficacy can be even higher if policy is more specifically targeted to elicit within-occupation job changes, where ex ante information seems more easily observable. Furthermore, there is still room for improvement if policy makers would not only focus on increased job mobility, but also would invest in transparency of labor markets. If workers would be more capable of observing job quality ex ante, they can better distinguish good <b>jobs</b> from <b>bad</b> <b>jobs,</b> and job mobility {{is more likely to}} improve matching efficiencies.|$|R
