50|$|In {{modern times}} the rituals {{associated}} with Marzanna {{have lost their}} sacred character and are a pastime - an occasion to have fun and celebrate the beginning of spring. The tradition is usually celebrated around the spring equinox (March 21). Usually schoolchildren and young people participate in the celebrations alongside local folklore groups and other residents. A procession consisting of men, women and children carries handmade Marzanna (and often also Marzaniok dolls, the male counterpart to Marzanna) to the nearest river, lake or pond. The participants sing traditional songs and throw effigies of Marzanna into the water. Sometimes the effigies are first set on fire, or their clothes are torn. On the journey back to the village the focus falls on the copses, adorned with ribbons and <b>blown</b> <b>egg</b> shells. The procession, still singing, returns to the village. In some locations (e.g. in Brynica - a district of Miasteczko Śląskie), the beginning of spring is then celebrated with a feast.|$|E

50|$|When {{collecting}} eggs, {{normally the}} whole clutch of eggs is taken. Because eggs will rot if the contents are left inside, {{they must be}} 'blown' to remove the contents.

50|$|Most {{species of}} blow flies studied thus far are anautogenous; a female {{requires}} {{a substantial amount}} of protein to develop mature eggs within her ovaries (about 800 µg per pair of ovaries in Phormia regina).

40|$|Typically, eggshell {{water vapor}} {{conductance}} is measured on whole eggs, freshly {{collected at the}} commencement of a study. At times, however, {{it may not be}} possible to obtain whole fresh eggs but rather egg fragments or previously <b>blown</b> <b>eggs.</b> Here we evaluate and describe in detail a technique for modern laboratory analysis of eggshell conductance that uses fragments from fresh and museum eggs to determine eggshell water vapor conductance. We used fresh unincubated eggs of domesticated chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus), and guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) to investigate the reliability, validity, and repeatability of the technique. To assess the suitability of museum samples, museum and freshly collected black-headed gull eggs (Larus ridibundus) were used. Fragments were cut out of the eggshell from the blunt end (B), equator (E), and pointy end (P). Eggshell fragments were glued {{to the top of a}} 0. 25 -mL micro test tube (Eppendorf) filled with 200 μL of distilled water and placed in a desiccator at 25 °C. Eppendorfs were weighed three times at 24 -h intervals, and mass loss was assumed to be a result of water evaporation. We report the following results: (1) mass loss between weighing sessions was highly repeatable and consistent in all species; (2) the majority of intraspecific variability in eggshell water vapor conductance between different eggs of the same species was explained through the differences in water vapor conductance between the three eggshell parts of the same egg (B, E, and P); (3) the technique was sensitive enough to detect significant differences between the three domestic species; (4) there was no overall significant difference between water vapor conductance of museum and fresh black-headed gull eggs; (5) there was no significant difference in water vapor conductance for egg fragments taken from the same egg both between different trials and within the same trial. We conclude, therefore, that this technique is an effective way of measuring interspecific water vapor conductance from eggshell fragments and that museum eggs are a suitable resource for such work.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Forensic {{entomology}} can aid death investigations {{by using}} predictable developmental changes {{to estimate the}} ages of flies associ-ated with a body. In developmental stages that do not increase in size however, including the egg and pupa, {{it can be difficult}} to objectively refine an age estimate beyond the limits of the stage duration. Gene transcript levels, changing throughout development, represent a potential data source useful for objectively identify smaller units of developmental time. The expression of three genes (bcd, sll, cs) was profiled throughout the maturation of <b>blow</b> fly <b>eggs</b> to determine the feasibility of predicting age, identifying significant linear trends in expression during their development. Models estimating egg age made predictions within 2 h of true age when all expression data were available, while the presence ⁄ absence of cs transcripts identified two age classes, together indicating that gene expression can be used to more precisely predict blow fly age...|$|R

25|$|Other {{potential}} and threatening diseases include rabbit haemorrhagic disease in New Zealand and flystrike. Although strike {{is not limited}} to blow flies, these maggots are a major source of this skin invasion, causing lesions, which, if severe enough, may be lethal. Strike starts when <b>blow</b> flies lay <b>eggs</b> in a wound or fecal material present on the sheep. When the maggots hatch, they begin feeding on the sheep and thus irritating it. As soon as the first wave of maggots hatch, they attract more blow flies, causing the strike. Insecticides are available for blow fly prevention, and precautionary measures may be taken, such as docking tails, shearing, and keeping the sheep healthy overall.|$|R
50|$|This led to Peakall working {{full-time}} on raptor pesticide problems, combining {{his passion}} for birds with his skills as a chemist. He measured DDE levels in peregrine eggs collected in Alaska from 1969 to 1973, and showed a strong inverse relationship between DDE content and eggshell thickness. The chemical industry claimed that shell thinning occurred too rapidly after the introduction of DDT in 1946 for DDT to be the cause. Peakall filled <b>blown</b> peregrine <b>eggs</b> collected from the critical period with solvent and measured DDE in the extracted lipids. DDE was present in sufficient concentrations to account for significant eggshell thinning in 1946 in Great Britain and as early as 1948 in California. Later, he would apply similar methods to California condor eggshell fragments as evidence that this species was extremely sensitive to DDE. His testimony at US congressional hearings contributed to the banning of DDT use in the United States. While at Cornell, Peakall also conducted studies {{on the ability of}} pesticides to induce breakdown of steroids, to alter vitamin D metabolism and calcium up-take, and on the role of carbonic anhydrase and calcium ATPase in eggshell thinning. He also pioneered research on the effects of PCBs on birds.|$|R

The purpose of this experiment was to create a more effective bait cup for a higher percent yield in oviposition. The three main questions studied were: “does the weight of the liver affect oviposition?”, “does the location of the bait cup affect the occurrence of oviposition?” and, “is a foil or a plastic cup more attractive for oviposition?” A one way ANOVA showed {{a significant difference in the}} amount of oviposition using different liver weights (F= 4. 5, df= 27, p= 0. 012). Tukey post hoc tests revealed significant differences between the 15 g and 60 g weights, and between the 30 g and 60 g weights. A one way ANOVA found no significant difference in the number of trials with oviposition in different locations (F= 2. 283, df= 34, p= 0. 084). An independent samples t-test found a significant difference in the number of trials with oviposition using foil vs. plastic cups (T=- 2. 61, df= 12, p= 0. 023).

5000|$|Male {{and female}} {{triggerfish}} perform certain pre-spawning behaviors: blowing and touching. A {{male and female}} blow water on the sandy bottom (usually {{in the same spot}} at the same time) and set up their egg site. They touch their abdomens on the bottom as if they are spawning. During actual spawning, eggs are laid on the sandy sea bottom (triggerfish are demersal spawners despite their large size). Eggs are scattered and attached to sand particles. Triggerfish eggs are usually very small (diameter of 0.5-0.6mm) [...] and are easily spread by waves. After spawning, both the male and female participate in caring for the fertilized eggs (biparental egg care). A female triggerfish stays near the spawning ground, around 5 meters off the bottom, and guards the eggs within her territory against intruders. Some common intruders include Parupeneus multifasciatus, Zanclus cornutus, Prionurus scalprum and conspecifics. Besides guarding, females will roll, fan, and <b>blow</b> water on <b>eggs</b> to provide oxygen to the embryo, thereby inducing hatching. [...] This behavior of female triggerfish is called 'tending,' and males rarely perform this behavior. A male triggerfish stays farther above the eggs and guards all the females and eggs in his territory. Males exhibit aggressive behaviors against conspecific males near the boundaries of their territories.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} protocol for extracting DNA from egg membranes and other internal debris {{recovered from the}} interior of <b>blown</b> museum bird <b>eggs.</b> A variety of commercially available DNA extraction methods {{were found to be}} applicable. DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products for a 176 -bp fragment of mitochondrial DNA was successful for most egg samples (> 78 %) even though the amount of DNA extracted (mean = 14. 71 ± 4. 55 ng/µL) was significantly less than that obtained for bird skin samples (mean = 67. 88 ± 4. 77 ng/µL). For PCR and sequencing of snipe (Gallinago) DNA, we provide eight new primers for the ‘DNA barcode’ region of COI mtDNA. In various combinations, the primers target a range of PCR products sized from 72 bp to the full ‘barcode’ of 751 bp. Not all possible combinations were tested with archive snipe DNA, but we found a significantly better success rate of PCR amplification for a shorter 176 -bp target compared with a larger 288 -bp fragment (67 % vs. 39 %). Finally, we explored the feasibility of whole genome amplification (WGA) for extending the use of archive DNA in PCR and sequencing applications. Of two WGA approaches, a PCR-based method was found to be able to amplify whole genomic DNA from archive skins and eggs from museum bird collections. After WGA, significantly more archive egg samples produced visible PCR products on agarose (56. 9 % before WGA vs. 79. 0 % after WGA).

40|$|Abstract. Xenopus egg {{extracts}} {{treated with}} the pro-tein kinase inhibitor 6 -dimethylaminopurine (6 -DMAP) are unable to support he initiation of DNA replication. Nuclei assembled in 6 -DMAP ex-tracts behave {{as though they are}} in G 2, and will not undergo another ound of DNA replication until pas-sage through mitosis. 6 -DMAP extracts are function-ally devoid of a replication factor that modifies chro-matin in early G 1 before nuclear envelope assembly, but which is itself incapable of crossing the nuclear envelope. This chromatin modification is capable of supporting only a single round of semiconservative replication. The behavior of this replication factor is sufficient o explain why eukaryotic DNA is replicated once and only once in each cell cycle, and conforms to the previous model of a Replication Licensing Fac-tor. Cell cycle analysis hows that this putative Licens-ing Factor is inactive during metaphase, but becomes rapidly activated on exit from metaphase when it can modify chromatin before nuclear envelope assembly is complete. T HE eukaryotic genome is replicated from 103 - 105 ini-tiation events which are coordinated so that no sec-tion of the DNA is replicated more than once in each S phase. In order to ensure that re-replication cannot occur, replicated DNA must differ in some way from unreplicated DNA, so that re-initiation does not occur on replicated DNA. This can be observed irectly in hybrids of G 1 and G 2 cells, where the G 1 nucleus passes directly into S phase, while the G 2 nucleus does not replicate until after the hybrid cell has passed through mitosis (Rao and Johnson, 1970). Mechanisms which prevent DNA from replicating more than once in a single cell cycle have been investigated using cell-free xtracts of Xenopus <b>eggs</b> (<b>Blow</b> and Laskey, 1988; Leno et al., 1992).

[...] Retzow Junior, though there is no evidence except of the circumstantial kind, thinks this current story may be true. [Retzow, i. 347.] Certain it is, neither Friedrich nor any of his people had the least suspicion of Daun's project, till the moment it exploded on them, when the clock at Hochkirch struck five. Daun, in the last two days, had been felling even more trees than they are aware of,--thousands of trees in those Devil's wildernesses to Friedrich's right; and has secretly hewn himself roads, passable by night for men and ammunition-wagons there:--and in front of Friedrich, especially Hochkirch way, Daun seems busier than ever felling wood, this Friday night; numbers of people running about with axes, with lanterns over there, as if in the push of hurry, and making a great deal of noise.

40|$|Forensic {{entomology}} is {{the application}} and study of insect biology to criminal matters. One {{of the most}} important aspects of forensic entomology is the usage of maggot found in dead human body to determine the post-mortem interval (PMI). Based on the number of maggot sent for PMI determination, the application of forensic entomology in crime scene investigation is still unsatisfactory in Malaysia. Hence the present study was the first to conduct a questionnaire survey to determine the degree of knowledge and awareness of forensic entomology in Malaysia. A total of 402 participants comprising of the crime scene police officers, pathologists who did the post-mortem examination, scientific officers and university students who have taken forensic science as their main subjects were included. Results showed that pathologists, scientific officers and university students have better awareness and knowledge of forensic entomology than the crime scene police officers. Hence more professional training is needed particularly among the crime scene police officers. The survey identified two major obstacles that may hinder the growth of forensic entomology in Malaysia which are the lack of information on the forensically important fly as well as the lack of expertise in species identification. Nevertheless the survey revealed a bright prospect for forensic entomology as evidenced by increased awareness of its importance and interest in the younger generation. The present study was the first to apply both morphological and molecular methods for fly species identification in samples collected from crime scene investigation in Malaysia. A total of 50 cases from December 2008 to March 2010 were included. The present study confirmed the usefulness of molecular method based on cytochrome oxidase genes sequencing as a complementary tool in assisting fly species identification. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the presence of Chrysomya megacephala, Chrysomya rufifacies, Chrysomya nigripes, Hemipyrellia ligurriens and Sarcophaga ruficornis. In addition, one ‘unknown’ species of blow fly was discovered. The application of molecular method has proven to be more advantageous in the case of immature maggot and egg. Due to the lack of experienced entomologist in Malaysia, it is recommended that molecular method should be widely applied. iii Since Chrysomya megacephala and Chrysomya rufifacies was found to be the two most prominent fly species recovered in crime scene investigation, DNA barcoding was done for each life cycle stage of both <b>blow</b> flies namely <b>egg,</b> 1 st instar, 2 nd instar, 3 rd instar, pupae, empty puparium and adult fly. The present study confirms that all life cycle stage of a particular species of fly yield identical DNA barcode and hence all the stages can be used for accurate species identification. The present study represents an initial effort to establish a DNA barcoding for forensically important blow fly in Malaysia. However, the effective use of DNA barcoding would require an expert system of integrated information whereby species names and their respective DNA barcodes are coupled with data of life cycle and geographic distributions...|$|R

In those four years, from 1 September 1904 till 1 September 1908, the collection of indigenous birds has been enlarged with about 1900 skins, by donation as well as by purchase. In the academical year from 1 September 1908 till 1 September 1909 this collection has been augmented again with about 675 skins, among which are three specimens belonging to two species, Megalestris skua and Serinus serinus, which were not represented in our collection of native birds. Our collection of indigenous birds becomes by little and little the standard-collection for the study of the avifauna of the Netherlands; it is at present by far the largest and the most complete collection in our country, though, as shown in my list of the Netherland birds, still some rare examples are desiderata to us. Yet, many species are still insufficiently represented and more material, especially that, collected during the breedingperiod, is wanted. Also the collection of the eggs of our birds is not at all up-to-date. The old collection, chiefly originating from Schlegel’s time, fifty at sixty years ago, is of no great value, as the eggs have been exposed to daylight during several years, most of the smaller eggs are very badly <b>blown</b> and the <b>eggs</b> have been preserved in a quite wrong manner, the eggs being left in the nests. It is therefore no wonder, that this collection also requires new material. This year about 560 eggs have been added to the collection. I am sorry that I must state here, that only a very small part of the acquisitions have been presented to us, by far the largest part has been purchased. In opposition to what we read in the annual reports of foreign musea, our museum is presented with very few objects, from our mother-country as well as from our colonies. Yet I believe, that if people knew, how good we can use different specimens, we should receive more; f. i. how many birds of prey, which are very welcome to us, are shot down or caught in traps and innocently thrown away! Here I have the pleasure to mention the following gentlemen, who kindly presented us with specimens for our collection of native birds: D. Bakker, Dr. J. F. van Bemmelen, F. E. Blaauw, J.
