40|$|It is {{commonly}} {{assumed that the}} world’s most successful companies have built their success {{on the basis of}} their own internal competencies and relentless single-handed pursuit of market impact. However, as Iansiti and Levien (2004) show, using examples of Microsoft, Wal-Mart, Dell and others, many of those firms have attained market leadership in their respective industries by developing and nurturing business ecosystems of partner firms. By embedding their competencies in technologically sophisticated and standard-setting platforms have those large firms attracted smaller firms to become partners and enabled them to leverage platforms, build on top of them and pursue particular niche. In doing so, large firms have become keystone players for their industry and expanded their impact, as in addition to their own activity they created basis for activity of bulk of smaller firms (niche players). This leads to the following question: how does such leveraging impact top-line and <b>bottom-line</b> <b>growth</b> of both keystone players and niche players? This paper addresses top-line impact in the context of niche players in the IT industry. Building on dynamic capabilities framework by Teece et al. (1997) and literature on measurement of intangible assets, this paper: i) presents conceptual model that shows how niche players can increase their competitiveness by strategically leveraging competencies of keystone players, and ii) proposes measures to estimate impact of such leverage o...|$|E

40|$|In today's highly {{competitive}} environment, {{most of the}} businesses in the manufacturing and service sectors {{have been forced to}} constantly monitor and have strict control not only over their top-line but also their <b>bottom-line</b> <b>growth.</b> As such being able {{to cut down on the}} cost of manufacturing or servicing has become one of the key performance indicators in the businesses. LEAN Manufacturing, which has now evolved into more of a LEAN Philosophy is a powerful approach used by today's businesses that are fighting hard to maintain a competitive edge in the market. The philosophy is also yielding benefits outside manufacturing. Manufacturing was also the original spawning ground of MRP and MRP II which later evolved into the now ubiquitous ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) that we find in virtually every type of corporate entity. It is quite appropriate to ask the question of how LEAN and ERP interact in today's business world, and specifically whether they are mutually exclusive, independent or mutually supportive concepts altogether. This exercise is to present, that the synergetic implementation of ERP could hugely strengthen the LEAN initiatives and vice versa. This applied research is done at MAS Holdings, who is currently having a very well established SAP system as their ERP solution, and a well matured LEAN system. MAS Holdings founded in 1986, is considered to be the region's single largest supplier of intimates apparel to worlds renowned brands such as Victoria's Secret, and being the preferred supplier to Nike and GAP. With a strong regional presence spanning 8 countries, MAS brings unparalleled supply chain integration, breathing life into design-to-delivery solutions through innovation and flexibility. MAS considers SAP, their ERP system, as one of their advantages in the business, being the first to go ahead with SAP AFS Industry Solution in the apparel sector, which is approximately a decade old. MAS's latest decision in adopting Lean Manufacturing system more as a Philosophy in the company demands for radical changes in the business processes. Due to the frameworks set during the initial implementation of SAP, now there occur misalignments between the two systems considered in MAS as advantages. An effort is made in this study to identify the misalignments between the two systems and to propose a framework or a model that could be adopted by the company to make the two systems coexist in complete harmony...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} CDR International 2 ̆ 7 s first board sponsored {{and senior}} executive approved and organized effort to leverage the labor arbitrage and service and performance opportunities existing {{in the global}} marketplace. I describe the initial phases {{of the formation of}} the outsourcing team, the challenges and political obstacles overcome and the decision making phase of this important organizational project. I argue that key factors for success of this initiative included a solid foundation of research, best practices, lessons-learned from comparable organizations, and most important, the formation of standard tools and methods for identifying and evaluating opportune functions for consideration. The development of these toolsets and methodologies has and continues to directly impact the decision making process. In correlation with {{the development and implementation of}} these standards and methods, and consistent with almost any organizational role, the importance of leveraging the organizational dynamics across the association was also vital. Accordingly, factors to success emanated from proper expectation setting, solid written and verbal communication skills, political and business savvy, and thoughtful and constructive organizational alliances. Although useful across a wide range of organizational roles, the mere importance and sensitivity of the outsourcing charter and its implications to <b>bottom-line</b> savings, top-line <b>growth</b> and the net effect to our career-minded employees, heighten the significance of those aforementioned traits...|$|R
