25|$|Packaging is the {{operation}} {{to put the}} wine in the container in which it will be marketed. Over the ages it was kept in a barrel or cask and the client would fill his pitcher or bottle at the wine merchant. The appearance of the glass bottle revolutionized the world of wine. The absence of transfer and thus contact with the oxygen in the air has made a significant improvement {{to the quality of}} the product. Other containers have emerged: the brick from Tetra Pak, the bottle of polyethylene terephthalate or PET, the <b>beverage</b> <b>can,</b> and the Bag-In-Box. Their quality is in their chemical inertness in relation to wine and their hermetic character against oxygen.|$|E
50|$|The alloy 3004 is {{commonly}} used {{in the making of}} <b>beverage</b> <b>cans.</b> It was developed to satisfy the need for thinner gauges in can-stock, and thereby to some extent replaced its predecessor 3003 alloy in the making of <b>beverage</b> <b>cans.</b> Can-stock can be made thinner due to the addition of 1% magnesium, which contributes in solid solution strengthening.|$|R

2500|$|Aluminum has a {{different}} optimal wall thickness to tubing diameter than steel. [...] It is at its strongest at around 200:1 (diameter:wall thickness), whereas steel is {{a small fraction of}} that. [...] However, at this ratio, the wall thickness would be comparable to that of a <b>beverage</b> <b>can,</b> far too fragile against impacts. [...] Thus, aluminum bicycle tubing is a compromise, offering a wall thickness to diameter ratio that is not of utmost efficiency, but gives us oversized tubing of more reasonable aerodynamically acceptable proportions and good resistance to impact. This results in a frame that is significantly stiffer than steel. [...] While many riders claim that steel frames give a smoother ride than aluminum because aluminum frames are designed to be stiffer, that claim is of questionable validity: the bicycle frame itself is extremely stiff vertically because it is made of triangles. Conversely, this very argument calls the claim of aluminum frames having greater vertical stiffness into question. On the other hand, lateral and twisting (torsional) stiffness improves acceleration and handling in some circumstances.|$|E
60|$|But {{there is}} one luxury at this feast which it would be unpardonable not to mention--namely the punch. Whoever tastes this <b>beverage</b> <b>can</b> never forget it! Description were useless to convey an idea of it. Imagination were {{impotent}} to form a conception of it. Taste alone will avail, so that our readers must either go to Cornwall to drink it, or for ever remain unsatisfied. We can only remark, in reference to it, that it is potent as well as pleasant, {{and that it is}} also dangerous, being of an insinuating nature, so that those who partake freely have a tendency to wish for more, and are apt to dream (not unreasonably, but too wildly) of Botallack tin being transformed into silver and gold.|$|E
