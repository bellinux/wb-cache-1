In addition to the storyline missions, there were side missions and bonus activities such as survival and foot races. Players with memberships saw this as the first zone to see tamable pets in. The Maelstrom minions here are easy, such as the Stromling, Stromling Mech, and the Dark Spiderling, born from the <b>Block</b> <b>Yard's</b> boss, the Spider Queen. The mini-game here is Avant Garden Survival. Here you must survive against Stromlings, Dark Spiderlings, Stromling Mechs, and other enemies more difficult to destroy. Avant Gardens is where you can tame the pets such as Doberman, Triceratops, and Buffalo. The two properties where you can build your creations in Avant Gardens are <b>Block</b> <b>Yard</b> and Avant Grove.|$|R

This study proposes two methods for optimizing the block size, by considering the throughput requirements of yard cranes (YCs) and the block storage requirements. To estimate the YC performance, cycle-time models of various handling operations of YCs are analytically derived. Two types of container yards are examined: those with blocks that are laid out parallel to the quay and those laid out vertical to the quay.

50|$|The station served Procter & Gamble {{and until}} 1914, {{neighboring}} industry Milliken Steel (which became Downey's Shipyard) as well. The station opened in 1906, and SIRT provided & scheduled trains to meet shift changes at Procter & Gamble. In 1925, {{a section of}} track was electrified from Arlington to Port Ivory. The passenger station ended in 1948. This was the terminal of the North Shore Branch until its closure. The Port Ivory Station platform was behind the Procter & Gamble employee cafeteria. Most trains terminated one station to the south at Arlington, but the SIRT ran some trains farther west through the yard to the Western Avenue grade crossing, then into the Procter & Gamble <b>plant</b> <b>yard.</b> The <b>plant</b> was the B & O's largest customer on the island. There was a main receiving <b>yard</b> at the <b>plant,</b> which was full of covered hoppers.

50|$|The {{streets were}} lined with tall trees that created a {{continuous}} canopy of shade. Gardens of ivy, shrubs, and flowering plants were created in the successive terraces from the streets {{to the base of}} the stairs of the typical front porches. Landings in the staircases through the terraces were marked with fountains and sculpture. Houses were built next to each other as row houses. Alleys between all streets provided access for servants and services. Fences separated properties into back <b>yards</b> <b>planted</b> with vegetable gardens and fruit trees, and sites for barns and garages. Many houses were constructed with two levels of cellars below the entry level from the main street, but all having disguised access for landscape equipment through the cellars under the house. Rear sleeping porches extended from the floors with bedrooms.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the allocation of}} <b>yard</b> cranes and <b>blocks</b> for <b>yard</b> activities in container terminals. In this paper, the yard cranes are confined to rail mounted gantry cranes (RMGC), which are characterized by the restricted traveling range {{on a pair of}} rails. Since RMGCs and <b>yard</b> <b>blocks</b> are tightly bound to each other, when allocating them, we should make sure that the RMGCs allocated for a yard activity are able to together cover the blocks allocated for the corresponding yard activity. In addition, considering that there are four basic activities occurring in the yard which compete with each other for the scarce resources and have different requirements and priorities in the allocation of <b>blocks</b> and <b>yard</b> cranes, we treat them in a single model rather than in multiple independent models as were generally done in literature. A mixed integer programming model is constructed, and an iterative decomposition solution procedure is proposed for the problem. Based on the solution procedure, a decision support system is developed and implemented for a terminal in Tianjin seaport. Using the actual data, the numerical experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision support system.

40|$|In {{cities where}} their scarce land {{supplies}} have {{to accommodate the}} gigantic capacities of port container terminals, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, the containers to be loaded onto the same vessel are usually stacked together to form tall stacked blocks. In most container yards, only one working lane adjacent to each <b>yard</b> <b>block</b> is available for the empty trucks to queue up to receive the export containers. When loading activities start, {{a large number of}} trucks flock to the loading <b>yard</b> <b>blocks</b> containing a huge number of export containers, thus jamming the working lane. This paper considers the problem of determining the sequence of trucks entering the working lane that minimizes the total time required to serve all the empty trucks dispatching to a loading <b>yard</b> <b>block.</b> An algorithm with easy implementation is developed to find the optimal sequence easily. © INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|Red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} thrive in urban areas, especially in backyards, golf courses, parks, recreational areas, school grounds, and street verges, {{in which their}} presence may deter outdoor activities. If they enter homes or properties, they can harm pets if they are either caged, penned, tied or cannot escape. Nests can be built under pavements or even roads, as well as under driveways, foundations, lawns, edges of sidewalks, under patio slabs, in electrical boxes or near power lines. A colony can excavate huge quantities of soil, resulting in structural problems in driveways, pavings and walls, and can also cause the formation of potholes in roads. Additional damage by mounds can be inflicted on trees, <b>yard</b> <b>plants,</b> and pipes; some structures may also collapse. Colonies may migrate into human homes after heavy rain to take refuge from saturated soil.|$|R

5000|$|Between the {{hydroelectric}} dam {{and industrial}} area in 10 km {{from the center}} of the old Alexandrovsk was established residential district #6, which was named [...] "Sotsgorod". In 20th doctrinaire idealistic enthusiasm of the architects was reflected in the intense debate about the habitation of the socialist community. The architects believed that by using new architectural forms they could create a new society. District #6 was one of the few implementations of urban development concepts. The construction of the district began in 1929 and finished in 1932. The main idea guiding the architects was the creation of the garden city, the city of the future. Multi-storey houses (not more than 4 floors) with large, roomy apartments were built in Sotsgorod with spacious <b>yards</b> <b>planted</b> with grass and trees around the buildings.Nikolai Kolli, V.A.Vesnin, G.M.Orlov, V.G.Lavrov and others designed the DniproHES and SotsGorod.
