5|$|As of 2014, {{researchers}} have identified 119 documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants from historical records. The exact number still remains unclear <b>because</b> <b>many</b> Hawaiians enlisted and served under Anglicized names, and {{little is known}} about them {{due to the lack of}} detailed records.|$|E
5|$|Estimates for {{the total}} number of {{casualties}} in the war vary, <b>because</b> <b>many</b> deaths went unrecorded. Most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war, including about 20 million military personnel and 40 million civilians.|$|E
5|$|Estimates {{ranged from}} 400 to 700 to 900 {{unauthorized}} file disclosures.

5|$|Horses {{used for}} chariot warfare {{were not only}} trained for combat conditions, but <b>because</b> <b>many</b> chariots were pulled {{by a team of}} two to four horses, they also had to learn to work {{together}} with other animals in close quarters under chaotic conditions.|$|E
5|$|Night diving {{can allow}} the diver to {{experience}} a different underwater environment, <b>because</b> <b>many</b> marine animals are nocturnal.

5|$|While {{the show}} portrays real events among the Kalahari Meerkats, it also removes {{repetitive}} {{elements of the}} animals' lives. <b>Because</b> <b>many</b> days are filled with behaviour related to grooming and foraging, these routines were often {{left out of the}} show in favour of more unusual events.|$|E
5|$|A {{growing number}} of astronomers argued for Pluto to be declassified as a planet, <b>because</b> <b>many</b> similar objects {{approaching}} its size {{had been found in}} the same region of the Solar System (the Kuiper belt) during the 1990s and early 2000s. Pluto was found to be just one small body in a population of thousands.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Kids Can Say No!, many {{teachers}} who showed the film to their students reported receiving disclosures of abuse. <b>Because</b> <b>many</b> of the teachers said they were unsure of {{how to deal with}} the disclosures, Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare. Kids Can Say No! encourages children to report abuse they experience and Beyond the Scare advises teachers about what to do if a child makes such a disclosure.|$|E

5|$|Although practised in Basse Casamance for centuries, rice {{cultivation}} has been threatened {{since the late}} 1960s. Productivity has declined <b>because</b> <b>many</b> workers have opted for life in the city, even though they continue to support their community. The drought of the 1970s and 1980s further aggravated the situation.|$|E
5|$|As {{the eldest}} child of king Alfonso and Eleanor, {{she was the}} heiress {{presumptive}} of the throne of Castile for several years, <b>because</b> <b>many</b> of her siblings who were born after her died shortly after birth or in early infancy, so Berengaria became a greatly desired partner throughout Europe.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>many</b> Native Americans {{were forced}} to move to Oklahoma when White {{settlement}} in North America increased, Oklahoma has much linguistic diversity. Mary Linn, {{an associate professor of}} anthropology at the University of Oklahoma and the associate curator of Native American languages at the Sam Noble Museum, notes Oklahoma also has high levels of language endangerment.|$|E

5|$|Chromium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Cr and atomic number 24. It {{is the first}} element in group 6. It is a steely-grey, lustrous, hard and brittle metal which takes a high polish, resists tarnishing, and has a high melting point. The name of the element {{is derived from the}} Greek word χρῶμα, chrōma, meaning color, <b>because</b> <b>many</b> chromium compounds are intensely colored.|$|E
5|$|Colony {{collapse}} disorder causes {{significant economic}} losses <b>because</b> <b>many</b> agricultural crops (although no staple foods) worldwide are pollinated by western honey bees. According to the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, {{the worth of}} global crops with honey bee pollination was estimated at close to $200 billion in 2005. Shortages of bees in the US have increased the cost to farmers renting them for pollination services by up to 20%.|$|E
5|$|Functional {{genomics}} using RNAi is {{a particularly}} attractive technique for genomic mapping and annotation in plants <b>because</b> <b>many</b> plants are polyploid, which presents substantial challenges for more traditional genetic engineering methods. For example, RNAi has been successfully used for functional genomics studies in bread wheat (which is hexaploid) {{as well as more}} common plant model systems Arabidopsis and maize.|$|E

5|$|However, some {{problems}} have been encountered with basing agencies in the eastern states. For example, Frontex, the new border agency, has had problems recruiting skilled experts <b>because</b> <b>many</b> {{do not want to}} live in the agency's host city, Warsaw, due to its relatively low wages and standard of living. In addition, plans to place the headquarters of Galileo in Prague met with opposition over security concerns that the city would not be safe enough for such a sensitive agency.|$|E
5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of a contact line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs <b>because</b> <b>many</b> different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} regions, the locally dominant Fulani ethnic group is mostly Muslim, {{but the overall}} population is fairly evenly divided among Muslims, Christians, and followers of indigenous religious beliefs (called Kirdi ("pagan") by the Fulani). The Bamum ethnic group of the West Region is largely Muslim. Native traditional religions are practiced in rural areas throughout the country but rarely are practiced publicly in cities, in part <b>because</b> <b>many</b> indigenous religious groups are intrinsically local in character.|$|E
