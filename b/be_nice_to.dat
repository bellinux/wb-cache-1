25|$|British writer Arthur C. Benson felt shyness is {{not mere}} self-consciousness, but a {{primitive}} suspicion of strangers, the primeval belief that their motives are predatory, with shyness a sinister quality which {{needs to be}} uprooted. He believed the remedy is for the shy to frequent society for courage from familiarity. Also, he claimed that too many shy adults take refuge in a critical attitude, engaging in brutal onslaughts on inoffensive persons. He felt that a better way is for the shy to <b>be</b> <b>nice,</b> <b>to</b> wonder what others need and like, interest in what others do or are talking about, friendly questions, and sympathy.|$|E

500|$|Every {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} an ornamental hare somewhere on-screen.

[...] "David and Maureen" [...] took place entirely in a single room, and was filmed in only two shots.
