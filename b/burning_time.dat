[...] The solid fuel increased the distance each runner could run to [...] over flat terrain, decreasing {{the number of}} torches needed to be produced, which in turn reduced {{the cost of the}} relay. There were eight tablets loaded into each torch, with the bottom tablets pushed up by the use of a spring. The design increased the <b>burning</b> <b>time</b> of each torch up to around fifteen minutes, an increase from the four-minute torches of the 1936 Olympics. The torch itself was designed by Ralph Lavers, with the brief that it should be [...] "inexpensive and easy to make, of pleasing appearance and a good example of British craftmanship". The torches were made from aluminium, with a long shaft holding a cup that contained the burner. [...] "With thanks to the bearer" [...] was written on the cup of the torch itself, along with the Olympic rings. The torches for the Greek leg of the relay were shipped to the Mediterranean aboard HMS Liverpool, along with a purpose built torch for the leg aboard a Royal Navy vessel from Corfu to Italy.|$|E

Transition to fully transient heat-up through the critical state is demonstrated above a threshold pressure corresponding to P(r) of roughly 1. 4. A silhouette imaging technique resolves the droplet surface for reduced pressures up to about P(r) roughly 0. 63, but soot formation conceals the surface at higher pressures. Images of the soot plumes do not show any sudden change in behavior indicative of critical transition. Mean burning rate constants are computed from the d-squared variation law using measured effective droplet diameters at ignition and measured burn <b>times,</b> and corrected <b>burning</b> <b>times</b> are computed for an effective initial droplet diameter.

40|$|Results of a {{study of}} {{heterogeneous}} and homogeneous combustion of metals in reduced gravity are presented. Cylindrical titanium and magnesium samples are radiatively ignited in pure-oxygen at 1 atm. Qualitative observations, propagation rates, and <b>burning</b> <b>times</b> are extracted from high-speed cinematography. Time-resolved emission spectra of gas-phase reactions are acquired with an imaging spectrograph. Lower propagation rates of the reacting mass on titanium and of ignition waves on magnesium are obtained at reduced gravity. These rates are compared to theoretical results from fire-spread analyses with a diffusion/convection controlled reaction. The close agreement found between experimental and theoretical propagation rates indicates the strong influence of natural-convection-enhanced oxygen transp 6 rt on burning rates. Lower oxygen flux and lack of condensed product removal appear {{to be responsible for}} longer <b>burning</b> <b>times</b> of magnesium gas-phase diffusion flames in reduced gravity. Spherically symmetric explosions in magnesium flames at reduced gravity (termed radiation-induced metal explosions, or RIME) may be driven by increased radiation heat transfer from accumulated condensed products to an evaporating metal core covered by a porous, flexible oxide coating. In titanium specimens, predominantly heterogeneous burning characterizes the initial steady propagation of the molten mass, while homogeneous gas-phase reactions are detected around particles ejected from the molten mixture. In magnesium specimens, band and line reversal of all the UV spectral systems of Mg and MgO are attributed to the interaction between small oxide particles and the principal gaseous emitters...|$|R

The long <b>burning</b> <b>times</b> for the woody {{stems of}} shrubs and their {{associated}} litter (Engber and Varner 2012) {{would be expected}} to contribute to cambial heating and higher levels of damage to low foliage, leading to higher mortality of trees near shrubs.

When conditions are conducive to fire, however, the severity of fire in riparian shrub communities could be higher due to greater fuel loads (e.g., Olson and Agee 2005, Van de Water and North 2011). Finally, although the aboveground portion of shrubs burns, some patches would likely remain unburned in isolated refugia (e.g., Hylander and Johnson 2010; Kolden et al. 2012, 2015), making the net effect of shrubs on tree mortality unclear.|$|R
