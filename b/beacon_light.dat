5|$|The Anglican parish {{church of}} St Michael {{dates from the}} 15th century and has been {{designated}} by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building; its tower used to display a <b>beacon</b> <b>light</b> for ships approaching the harbour. After being caught in a violent storm at sea, Robert Quirke dedicated a ship and its cargo to God's service, as well as donating a cellar near the quay for prayers to be offered for those at sea. Dating from 1628 and known as the Gibraltar Celler , {{it is now the}} Chapel of St Peter. Quirke also donated money from the sale of the ship and its cargo to build almshouses.|$|E

Like his father, during his elementary school years, Hurdzan started as a caddie; he later became Kidwell's greenskeeper at the age of 13.|$|E
25|$|The beacons were trailer-mounted. The <b>beacon</b> <b>light</b> itself {{consisted}} of eight 400watt red neon tubes mounted {{in a glass}} pyramid lamp house. They were powered by a 16.9bhp Coventry Climax petrol engine-generator set driving a set of eight induction coils to produce the high voltage needed by the neon tubes. The complete engine-generator, Morse code sequencer and lamp house was carried on the trailer. In transit, the lamp house was carried on {{the rear of the}} generator housing to reduce overall height, then put in place once on site.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, Scottish {{researcher}} James Easton {{obtained the}} original witness {{statements made by}} {{those involved in the}} first nightâ€™s sightings. One of the witnesses, Ed Cabansag, said in his statement: [...] "We figured the lights were coming from past the forest since nothing was visible when we passed through the woody forest. We would see a glowing near the <b>beacon</b> <b>light,</b> but as we got closer we found it to be a lit-up farmhouse. We got to a vantage point where we could determine that what we were chasing was only a <b>beacon</b> <b>light</b> off in the distance." [...] Another participant, John Burroughs, also stated: [...] "We could see a beacon going around so we went towards it. We followed it for about two miles [...] before we could [...] it was coming from a lighthouse." ...|$|E

60|$|After the {{disaster}} the mate had taken charge, {{and the men}} had transferred their supplies to the shore and gone to living there. They had had more than enough oil to burn, and during the winter had kept a <b>beacon</b> <b>light</b> going, hoping it might bring some one to their assistance. Several had proved themselves good hunters, so they did not suffer for something to eat, although their diet was a limited one.|$|E

60|$|The last {{light is}} {{extinguished}} {{in the village}} of Bethany. The wailing breeze has become a moaning wind; a white film spreads over the purple sky; the stars are veiled, the stars are hid; all becomes as dark as the waters of Kedron and the valley of Jehosha-phat. The tower of David merges into obscurity; no longer glitter the minarets of the mosque of Omar; Bethesda's angelic waters, the gate of Stephen, the street of sacred sorrow, the hill of Salem, and the heights of Scopas can no longer be discerned. Alone in the increasing darkness, while the very line of the walls gradually eludes the eye, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is a <b>beacon</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E

60|$|Then, as {{the smell}} of the man came to her from the tainted underbrush, the {{absolute}} necessity of teaching them their neglected second lesson before another danger should find them swept over her in a flood. She sprang aside with a great bound, and the hoarse K-a-a-a-h! k-a-a-a-h! crashed through the woods again. Her tail was straight up, the white flag showing like a <b>beacon</b> <b>light</b> as she jumped away. Behind her the fawns stood startled a moment, trembling with a new wonder. Then their flags went up too, and they wabbled away on slender legs through the tangles and over the rough places of the wood, bravely following their leader. And I, watching from my hiding, with a vague regret that they could never again be mine, not even for a moment, saw only the crinkling lines of underbrush and here and there the flash of a little white flag. So they went up the hill and out of sight.|$|E
6000|$|As night came {{on there}} could be seen, {{twinkling}} far away upon the horizon, a <b>beacon</b> <b>light,</b> which {{in those days was}} kept burning {{for the benefit of the}} piratical craft which made a rendezvous of the waters off Belize, then the commercial centre for the vessels of the [...] "free companions." [...] Having supposed, in his unnautical mind, that his entrance into the Gulf of Honduras meant the end of his present voyage, and not wishing to lower his own feeling of importance by asking too many questions of his inferiors, Captain Bonnet had bedecked himself a day too soon, and there were some jeers and sneers among his crew when he descended to his cabin to take off his fine clothes. But his self-complacency was well armoured, and he did not hear the jokes of which he was the subject, especially by the little clique of which Black Paul was the centre. But the sailing-master knew his business, and the Revenge was safely, though slowly, sailed among the coral-reefs and islands until she dropped anchor off Belize. Early in the morning the now dignified and pompous Captain Bonnet, of that terror of the seas, the pirate craft Revenge, again arrayed himself in a manner befitting his position, and stationed himself on the quarter-deck, where he might be seen by the eyes of all the crews of the other pirate vessels anchored about them and by the glasses of their officers.|$|E

60|$|Ethel prevailed by {{following}} her brother to his room, and perching {{herself on the}} window-sill, while he read his performance from many slips of paper. The visions of those boyish days had not been forgotten, the Vesuvius scenery was much as Ethel had once described it, but with far more force and beauty; there was Decius's impassioned address to the beauteous land {{he was about to}} leave, and the remembrances of his Roman hearth, his farm, his children, whom he quitted for the pale shadows of an uncertain Elysium. There was a great hiatus in the middle, and Norman had many more authorities to consult, but the summing-up was nearly complete, and Ethel thought the last lines grand, as they spoke of the noble consul's name living for evermore, added to the examples that nerve ardent souls to devote life, and all that is precious, to the call of duty. Fame is not their object. She may crown their pale brows, but for the good of others, not their own, a <b>beacon</b> <b>light</b> to the world. Self is no object of theirs, and it is the casting self behind that wins--not always the visible earthly strife, but the combat between good and evil. They are the true victors, and, whether chronicled or forgotten, true glory rests on their heads, the sole true glory that man can attain, namely, the reflected beams that crown them as shadowy types of Him whom Decius knew not--the Prince who gave Himself for His people, and thus rendered death, for Truth's sake, the highest boon to mortal man.|$|E

50|$|All {{aircraft}} built after 11 March 1996 {{must have}} an anti-collision light system (strobe <b>lights</b> or rotating <b>beacon)</b> turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. The anti-collision system is recommended in good visibility, where only strobes and beacon are required. For example, just before pushback, the pilot must keep the <b>beacon</b> <b>lights</b> on to notify ground crews that the engines are about to start. These <b>beacon</b> <b>lights</b> stay on {{for the duration of}} the flight. While taxiing, the taxi lights are on. When coming onto the runway, the taxi lights go off and the landing lights and strobes go on. When passing 10,000 feet, the landing lights are no longer required, and the pilot can elect to turn them off. The same cycle in reverse order applies when landing.|$|R
