30|$|Thermal self-compressing bonding (TSCB) {{is a new}} {{solid-state}} bonding method {{pioneered by}} the authors. With electron beam as the non-melted heat source, previous experimental study performed on titanium alloys has proved the feasibility of TSCB. However, the thermal stress–strain process during bonding, which is of very important significance in revealing the mechanism of TSCB, was not analysed. In this paper, finite element analysis method is adopted to numerically study the thermal elasto-plastic stress–strain cycle of thermal self-compressing bonding. It is found that due to the localized heating, a non-uniform temperature distribution is formed during bonding, with the highest temperature existed on the <b>bond</b> <b>interface.</b> The expansion of high temperature materials adjacent to the <b>bond</b> <b>interface</b> are restrained by surrounding cool materials and rigid restraints, and thus an internal elasto-plastic stress–strain field is developed by itself which makes the <b>bond</b> <b>interface</b> subjected to thermal compressive action. This thermal self-compressing action combined with the high temperature on the <b>bond</b> <b>interface</b> promotes the atom diffusion across the <b>bond</b> <b>interface</b> to produce solid-state joints.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} electrical measurements and sample modifications that enabled the electrical properties of hybrid-orientation direct silicon <b>bonded</b> wafer <b>interfaces</b> to be determined.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, the shear-mode (Mode-II) {{fracture}} toughness of wood– wood and wood–fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) <b>bonded</b> <b>interfaces</b> using unique linear tapered end-notched flexure (TENF) specimens is evaluated. A tapered beam on elastic foundation (TBEF) model developed for design {{and analysis of}} the TENF specimens is briefly introduced. Based on the TBEF model, the TENF specimens are designed to achieve an approximate constant compliance rate change for fracture tests, and design procedures for Mode-II fracture of <b>bonded</b> <b>interface</b> are accordingly developed. The linear compliance rate changes of the designed TENF specimens are verified experimentally by the compliance calibration tests and numerically by finite element modeling. Two types of TENF specimens, namely for wood–wood and wood–FRP <b>bonded</b> <b>interfaces,</b> are designed and tested to determine the {{fracture toughness}} values of adhesively <b>bonded</b> <b>interfaces</b> under Mode-II loading. The critical loads for crack initiation and arrest are measured during the testing, in which the critical strain energy release rates are then easily evaluated by making use of the approximate constant compliance rate change of the designed specimens over defined crack lengths. The wood–wood and wood–FRP <b>bonded</b> <b>interfaces</b> tested in this study exhibit a stable crack propagation behavior. The unique TENF specimen and experimental–design program presented in this paper can be efficiently used to evaluate the Model-II fracture toughness of hybrid material <b>interface</b> <b>bonds,</b> and the fracture toughness values obtained can be applied to detect the potential delamination and crack growth of the adhesively bonded joints...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that it is {{difficult}} to bond dissimilar metals such as aluminum and copper or aluminum and iron using diffusion bonding, because an intermetallic compound is easily produced at the <b>bond</b> <b>interface</b> and <b>bonding</b> strength becomes low.
