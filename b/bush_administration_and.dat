25|$|There was a {{widespread}} belief {{on all sides}} of the debate, confirmed by top Bush administration officials, that politics {{played a role in the}} decision to impose tariffs.

Harper also came under criticism for his laissez-faire attitude to the job sector, supporting primarily the oil companies and companies that outsource jobs in the manufacturing sector.|$|E
