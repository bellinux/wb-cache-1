25|$|Blix's {{statements}} about the Iraq WMD program came to contradict {{the claims of the}} George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> <b>and</b> attracted a great deal of criticism from supporters of the invasion of Iraq.

25|$|There was a {{widespread}} belief {{on all sides}} of the debate, confirmed by top Bush administration officials, that politics {{played a role in the}} decision to impose tariffs.

May lashed out at Harper for not understanding that Canadians were worried about their homes, jobs and finances, and comparing the current situation to Dutch disease, Dion stated that the only thing that keeps Canada from being hit as hard by the crisis as the US are laws created by the previous Liberal government that the Conservatives had been attempting to overturn, Duceppe repeatedly criticized Harper for financial practices and attitudes similar to the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> <b>and</b> Layton at one point stated that Harper's position showed he was either incompetent or uncaring to the situation, and asked which one he was, to which Harper did not respond. Harper also came under criticism for his laissez-faire attitude to the job sector, supporting primarily the oil companies and companies that outsource jobs in the manufacturing sector.|$|E
