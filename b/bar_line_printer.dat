50|$|Machine control characters, in contrast, are {{the very}} {{commands}} which IBM <b>line</b> <b>printers</b> understand. This is why they are hardware dependent or hardware determined. IBM defined this set of commands for their <b>line</b> <b>printers</b> and made sure all their <b>line</b> <b>printers</b> understand them. Other (mainframe) <b>line</b> <b>printer</b> manufacturers also {{had to make sure}} their printers understood those commands. Since machine control characters are hardware commands, many of them are not displayable characters and therefore machine control characters are always specified as hexadecimal values.|$|R
5000|$|The {{names of}} the [...] and [...] {{commands}} in Unix were derived from the term [...] "line printer". Analogously, many other systems call their printing devices [...] "LP", [...] "LPT", or some similar variant, whether these devices are in fact <b>line</b> <b>printers</b> or other types of printers. These references served to distinguish formatted final output from normal interactive output from the system, which in many cases in <b>line</b> <b>printer</b> days was also printed on paper (as by a teletype) but not by a <b>line</b> <b>printer.</b> <b>Line</b> <b>printers</b> printed characters, letters and numbers line by line.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Line</b> <b>{{printers}}</b> are {{the fastest}} of all impact printers {{and are used}} for bulk printing in large computer centres. A <b>line</b> <b>printer</b> can print at 1100 lines per minute or faster, frequently printing pages more rapidly than many current laser printers. On the other hand, the mechanical components of <b>line</b> <b>printers</b> operat with tight tolerances and require regular preventive maintenance (PM) to produce top quality print. They are virtually never used with personal computers and have now been replaced by high-speed laser printers. The legacy of <b>line</b> <b>printers</b> lives on in many computer operating systems, which use the abbreviations [...] "lp", [...] "lpr", or [...] "LPT" [...] to refer to printers.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>line</b> <b>printer</b> is {{an impact}} printer that prints one entire line of text at a time. It is mostly {{associated}} with unit record {{equipment and the}} early days of digital computing, but the technology is still in use. Print speeds of 600 lines-per-minute (approximately 10 pages per minute) were achieved in the 1950s, later increasing to as much as 1200 lpm. <b>Line</b> <b>printers</b> print a complete line at a time and have speeds in the range of 150 to 2500 lines per minute. The different types of <b>line</b> <b>printers</b> are drum printers and chain printers. Other non-impact technologies have also been used, as thermal <b>line</b> <b>printers</b> were popular in the 1970s and 1980s, [...] and some inkjet and laser printers produce output a line or a page at a time.|$|R

50|$|Early {{mainframe}} printers were {{so called}} <b>line</b> <b>printers.</b> <b>Line</b> <b>printers</b> provided {{only a very}} limited set of commands to control how the paper was advanced when print lines were printed. The application writing reports, list, etc. to be printed had to include those commands in the print data. These single character print commands are called printer control characters.|$|R

One of them is a graphic speed and the other is a mass of graphics. We experienced concerned with a speed of graphics that it takes 5 ～ 20 minutes to graphic by a X-Y plotter, but it takes only 1 ～ 2 secs to graphic the allmost same object by a high speed <b>line</b> <b>printer.</b> The other our experience is that it is very effective to eliminate the errors from a lot of experimental data, when we use this way of the graphic. We reported our experienes and the merits by a high speed <b>line</b> <b>printer.</b> We keep our new eye for the merits of the computer graphics by a high speed printer.

5000|$|The <b>line</b> <b>printer</b> {{employed}} {{a series of}} status codes, specifically ready, online, and check.

However, if the online code was set to [...] "on" [...] and the check code was also set to [...] "on", it meant that the printer still had paper, but was suffering an error (and may still be attempting to run). Due to the potentially hazardous conditions which could arise in early <b>line</b> <b>printers,</b> Unix displayed the message [...] "on fire" [...] to motivate any system operator viewing the message to go and check on the <b>line</b> <b>printer</b> immediately.|$|R
