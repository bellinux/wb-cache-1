5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is not {{threatened by}} human activity, and is widespread throughout its range. The clearing of forests by humans, though harmful to many species, has benefited the American goldfinch.

5|$|Using deficit spending, a government-sponsored {{programme}} {{for economic}} renewal focused on public works projects.

5|$|Another {{instance}} of population control is {{the prevalence of}} female infanticide. People in rural areas practiced female infanticide and selective neglect due to a preference of sons over daughters. Since the 1980s, roughly 200,000 female infants would be killed per {{year because of the}} preference for male children and the advancement in technologies such as ultrasound, which help to find out the sex of the fetus. In addition to female infanticide, girls are being unregistered or are abandoned by their families, which stops them from receiving education and legal <b>benefits</b> <b>the</b> government offered. These methods of controlling population have resulted in a huge gender gap in China.|$|E

5|$|Club captain Noel Spencer was {{released}} by the Mariners, then signed {{to participate in the}} Asian Champions League by Sydney FC after the 2006–07 season, and Alex Wilkinson was appointed the new captain. Only 22 years of age at the time, Wilkinson had played every possible competitive match for the Mariners up to his appointment. In February 2008, Central Coast Mariners signed an arrangement with English Football League Championship side Sheffield United. The partnership was one of several connections the Mariners made with foreign clubs; other partner clubs included Ferencváros of Hungary, Chengdu Blades of China and São Paulo of Brazil. The agreement <b>benefits</b> <b>the</b> club by providing an opportunity for the youth programme and senior side to draw from the roster of Sheffield United through transfers.

5|$|Despite its shorter term {{political}} <b>benefits,</b> <b>the</b> South Vietnamese {{government also}} had {{complaints about the}} way the Americans set up the CIP. Diem and Nhu claimed that the paperwork involved in the applications for imports made the process was too slow and hindered the development of an emerging economy where the market situation changed rapidly. In particular, any investment in capital goods by importers that cost more than USD500,000 needed a formal American review before approval. Nhu also publicly criticized the review policy on several occasions, citing several private infrastructure investments that were blocked by American administrators. Nhu and Diem felt that the regulations that the Americans put {{on the use of the}} piaster fund obtained from Vietnamese importers were stifling their ability to accelerate development, especially as the planning and approval reviews took a long time.|$|E

Planes flew claims adjusters and other officials to Innisfail, establishing an insurance emergency service in the city hall, while the Insurance Council of Queensland deployed its special emergency service employees for the first time. As a result of severe damage, a disaster declaration for northern regions was issued by Queensland Government on 4February. The first $10million in aid from the state government, paid by the federal government, was supplied the same day. Meanwhile, the SES continued its cleanup efforts, removing debris and repairing structures. Looters took advantage of confusion in the days following the cyclone, striking residences throughout Innisfail. By the end of the day, 2200tarpaulins had been distributed; however, the previously-smooth relief efforts were impeded by thunderstorms in Cairns.|$|E

5|$|Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche criticised all {{contemporary}} moral systems, with {{a special}} focus on Christian and Kantian ethics. He argued that all modern ethical systems share two problematic characteristics: first, they make a metaphysical claim {{about the nature of}} humanity, which must be accepted for the system to have any normative force; and second, the system <b>benefits</b> <b>the</b> interests of certain people, often over those of others. Although Nietzsche's primary objection is not that metaphysical claims about humanity are untenable (he also objected to ethical theories that do not make such claims), his two main targets—Kantianism and Christianity—do make metaphysical claims, which therefore feature prominently in Nietzsche's criticism.|$|E

For Wood, the greatest benefit was that the BBC gave him twice as much rehearsal time as he had previously enjoyed. He now had a daily rehearsal and extra rehearsals as needed. He was also allowed extra players when large scores called for them, instead of having to rescore the work for the forces available.|$|E

5|$|The GRC scheme {{has also}} been criticized for raising the bar for the {{opposition}} in elections. First, opposition parties may find it harder to find competent candidates, including minority candidates, to form teams to contest GRCs. Goh Chok Tong has acknowledged that the GRC scheme <b>benefits</b> <b>the</b> PAP as they can put together stronger teams. With the GRC system the threshold for votes for the opposition is also increased, and opposition parties {{have to take a}} gamble and commit huge proportions of their resources to contest GRCs. Each candidate in a GRC is required to deposit a sum equal to 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the calendar year preceding the election, rounded to the nearest S$500. At the 2011 general election, the deposit was $16,000. Unsuccessful candidates have their deposits forfeited if they do not receive at least one-eighth {{of the total number of}} votes polled in the GRC. Critics have noted that the number of walkovers has generally increased since the introduction of GRCs. To date, only one opposition party, the Workers' Party, has won a GRC: Aljunied, in the 2011 general election.|$|E
5|$|The RAF {{activated}} 20 squadrons between September 1958 and December 1959 {{to operate}} the 120 Thor missiles. They were located at 20 old wartime airfields so that {{the government did not}} have to purchase the land. Each missile was supplied with its own Mark 49 warhead, a variant of the Mark 28 with a thinner and lighter casing. While the Thor missile bases were manned by the RAF, the warheads were supplied under Project E. Each one had a USAF authorisation officer. The missiles used a dual key system, one of which was held by the authorisation officer. Occasionally a missile would be chosen for test firing, for which the missile and its RAF crew would be flown to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Twelve test firings were conducted between 6 October 1959 and 12 June 1962. Under the original agreement, the USAF paid the cost of maintenance for the missiles for five years. After a debate over costs and <b>benefits,</b> <b>the</b> Air Council decided on 31 May 1962 that Project Emily should be terminated by the end of 1963. The last Thor squadrons were inactivated on 23 August 1963. The missiles were returned to the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} male over-representation {{in terms of}} total number of sports and athletes is structural. In the United Kingdom, for example, more male athletes than female ones receive {{financial}} support. Sports officials rationalise this uneven distribution by claiming {{that there are more}} opportunities for men to win at the highest level than there are for women. The importance of being part of the Summer Olympics is illustrated by softball, and the <b>benefits</b> <b>the</b> sport derived from its inclusion. This included additional media coverage, especially during Olympic years. Olympic recognition plays an important part in getting sponsorship for local competitions around the world and providing new opportunities for females.|$|E
