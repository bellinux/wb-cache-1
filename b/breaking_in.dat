40|$|Office {{workers are}} {{commonly}} targeted in interventions {{to modify their}} sitting behaviour, yet there is limited evidence of the correlates of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting to inform intervention development. This study identifies the individual, workplace and spatial configuration correlates of the frequency of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting (number/hour) in office workers (n = 5531) stratified by office type (private-enclosed, shared, open plan). All behaviours and potential correlates were measured via self-report using an online cross-sectional survey. Regression analyses revealed age was the only socio-demographic characteristic associated with frequency of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting in all office types. Greater job autonomy and local connectivity were positively associated with frequency of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting in shared and open-plan offices. In open-plan offices co-worker proximity was negatively associated with frequency of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting. Co-worker visibility was positively associated with frequency of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting in all office types. This study demonstrates that individual, workplace and spatial configuration factors are all associated with the frequency of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting and that these relationships differ by office type. These observations extend prior studies that have only examined correlates at a single level (e. g. the individual). This evidence could be useful to guide future interventions {{in the design of}} workplaces to increase <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting and workers physical activity...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: To date it {{is unknown}} whether there are moderating {{variables}} for the associations between children’s self-reported screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time and objectively measured sedentary time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sedentary time. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine whether the associations between self-reported screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time and accelerometer assessed sedentary time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sedentary time were moderated by gender, ethnicity, children’s moderate-to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), parents’ educational level, parents’ screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time and parents physical activity (PA). Methods: Screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time were assessed with questionnaires in a sample of 445 children (10 - 12 years) in Belgium, Greece, Hungary and Norway. Parents’ screen time, <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time, parents’ PA and demographics were also assessed with questionnaires. Accelerometers measured sedentary time per day and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sedentary time per day and MVPA (children only). Bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were applied to assess the associations between the independent variables and the dependent variables. Interaction terms were added in the final model to examine whether the associations between self-reported screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time and accelerometer assessed sedentary time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sedentary time were moderated by the significant independent variables. Results: No statistical significant interactions were found between the significant independent variables. Country specific significant associations were found between self-reported screen time and gender, parents’ screen time, parents’ educational level and accelerometer assessed sedentary time. Country specific associations were found between self-reported breaks during one hour of screen time and parents’ educational level and ethnicity. Conclusion: The associations between self-reported screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time and accelerometer assessed sedentary time and breaks were not moderated by gender, ethnicity, MVPA, parents’ educational level, parents’ self-reported screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time and parents’ PA.

5|$|Sea anemones breed by {{liberating}} {{sperm and}} eggs through the mouth into the sea. The resulting fertilized eggs develop into planula larvae which, after being planktonic for a while, {{settle on the}} seabed and develop directly into juvenile polyps. Sea anemones also breed asexually, by <b>breaking</b> <b>in</b> half or into smaller pieces which regenerate into polyps. Sea anemones are sometimes kept in reef aquariums; the global trade in marine ornamentals for this purpose is expanding and threatens sea anemone populations in some localities, as the trade depends on collection from the wild.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{other members}} of this phylum, {{anthozoans}} {{do not have a}} medusa stage in their development. Instead, they release sperm and eggs into the water. After fertilisation, the planula larvae form part of the plankton. When fully developed, the larvae settle on the seabed and attach to the substrate, undergoing metamorphosis into polyps. Some anthozoans can also reproduce asexually through budding or by <b>breaking</b> <b>in</b> pieces. More than 6,100 species have been described.|$|E

5|$|A dance crew {{is a team}} {{of street}} dancers who come {{together}} to develop new moves and battle other crews. As hip-hop culture spread throughout New York City, the more often breaking crews got together to battle against each other.

All styles of hip-hop are rooted in battling, and {{being a part of}} a crew {{was the only way to}} learn when these styles began because they were not taught in studios: they all started out as social dances.

Before <b>breaking</b> <b>in,</b> he and Scully discuss the odd behavior of the roaches, with Scully hypothesizing that the roaches could be an invasive species. Inside the facility, which resembles a typical house, Mulder sees the walls rippling and is quickly surrounded by roaches. He is then confronted by Dr. Bambi Berenbaum (Bobbie Phillips), a researcher from the Department of Agriculture who is studying cockroaches to develop more effective methods of pest control. Berenbaum has great interest in insects and, incidentally, believes that some UFOs are actually insect swarms flying through electrically charged airspaces. Yet another death occurs in Mulder's hotel, with the individual being found covered in roaches that quickly flee. At this point, Mulder believes that the individual simply died of fright, though Scully begins to wonder {{what is going on}} and decides to head up there herself.|$|E

5|$|Architecturally, Plas Mawr {{is almost}} {{unchanged}} from the 16th century, {{making it a}} very rare survival from this period. The architectural style {{is a product of}} the broader Renaissance influences prevalent across Europe at the time. Robert Wynn spent time in Germany, and the style of Plas Mawr makes use of North German Gothic themes, particularly in its use of symmetry, the pedimented windows at the front of the house, faceted finials and crow-stepped gables. These features were already popular in England when the house was built, and indeed Plas Mawr is very similar in design to Eastbury Manor House, the two possibly being based off the same architectural plan. Some of these features had already begun to spread into Wales – crow-stepped gables, for example, were already being used in Flintshire by the 1580s – but others were ground <b>breaking</b> <b>in</b> Wales, such as the use of ovolo-moulded and dormer windows. Nonetheless, Robert Wynn was only an emerging member of the gentry, and his house was not as large or as sophisticated as contemporary grander Renaissance properties built in larger rural settings.|$|E
