5000|$|Spray {{painting}} with solvent-based or water-based paint creates paint overspray, a waste material {{that must be}} effectively neutralized, or [...] "detackified", and collected for disposal. In order {{to assist in the}} removal of the oversprayed paint from the air and to provide efficient operation of the down-draft, water-washed paint spray booths utilize paint detackifying chemical agents. The detackification products are commonly introduced into the water that is recirculated in the paint spray <b>booth</b> <b>system.</b> The first purpose is to render the paint non tacky so it does not stick to the booth equipment and foul the paint system.

40|$|I {{propose the}} {{replacement}} of our current system of individual and corporate income, sales, excise, capital gains, import and export duties, gift and estate taxes with a single comprehensive “revenue neutral” Automated Payment Transaction (APT) tax. The APT tax consists of a flat rate tax levied on all voluntary transactions. The total volume of transactions represents the broadest conceivable tax base and therefore requires the lowest conceivable marginal tax rate. Since the efficiency (misallocation) costs of a tax system tend to rise geometrically with the marginal tax rate, a massive reduction in tax rates can save an estimated $ 300 billion of misallocation {{costs associated with the}} current tax system. The APT tax is automatically assessed and collected when transactions are routinely settled through the electronic technology of the bank/payments clearing system with no deductions, exemptions, or exclusions. The APT tax also imposes an automatically collected tax on cash as it enters and leaves the banking system. All income and information tax returns are eliminated as taxes are digitally assessed and collected by the financial equivalent of the E-Z pass that is now used to speed traffic through a toll <b>booth</b> <b>system</b> on highways. The annual savings in compliance and administrative costs are estimated to be $ 200 billion per year. Unlike the “Fair Tax” or “National Sales Tax” proposals which are highly regressive, the flat rate APT tax introduces progressivity through the tax base since the total volume of transactions includes all asset transactions involving exchanges of titles to property. The wealthy carry out a disproportionate share of these asset exchanges and therefore bear a disproportionate burden of the tax despite its flat rate structure. The perceived fairness, even handedness and simplicity of the APT tax will greatly reduce tax evasion, which the IRS estimates to total $ 325 billion per year. Like all taxes, the APT tax creates new distortions which must be weighed against the benefits obtained by scrapping the current tax system. Scrapping the present tax system tax promises potential benefits estimated at $ 825 billion annually. The proposed APT tax is simple, comprehensible, fair and efficient, with minimal administrative and compliance costs. The burden of proof therefore rests with APT tax opponents who must demonstrate that its costs exceed the $ 825 billion of potential annual benefits.

Since innovative technology, such as <b>booth</b> recommender <b>systems</b> (BRS), is changing, creating uncertainty among consumers, consumer’s resistance to innovative technology {{can be considered a}} normal reaction. Therefore, it is important for a company to understand the psychological aspect of the consumer’s resistance and make measures to overcome the resistance. Accordingly, based on the model of Kim and Kankanhalli (2009), by applying the perceived value, the technology acceptance model, and the status quo bias theory, this study focused on the importance of self-efficacy and technical support in the context of using BRS. To do this purpose, a total of 455 survey data that was collected from “Korea franchise exhibition” attendees were used to analyze the proposed model. Structural equation modeling was applied for data analysis. The result shows that perceived value was affected by relative advantage and switching cost, also switching cost reduced the perceived value. However, self-efficacy reduced the switching cost, thereby decreasing the resistance of exhibition attendees. In addition, technical support increased the relative advantage switching cost and the perceived value. Exhibition attendee’s resistance was significantly negatively affected by perceived value, and positively affected by switching cost. The results will provide balanced viewpoints between the relative advantage and switching cost for exhibition marketers, helping to strengthen the competitiveness in terms of sustainable tourism of exhibition...|$|R

40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems use {{electromagnetic}} {{signals to}} wirelessly identify and track RFID-tagged objects. A reader transmits a carrier wave request signal to an RFID tag, which then transmits a unique identification signal {{back to the}} reader. Applications include supply chain inventory management, automated toll <b>booth</b> fee <b>systems,</b> sports event timing, restricted access control, pet monitoring and retail theft prevention. An RFID tag includes an antenna connected to a Radio Frequency Integrated Circuit (RFIC). RFID tags in the ultra-high frequency (UHF), industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) 902 - 928 MHz band and global Electronic Product Code (EPC) 860 ‑ 960 MHz band are powered passively (power extracted from carrier wave) and cost less than 15 cents per tag. Low cost UHF ISM RFID tags are an effective solution for tracking large inventories. UHF ISM tag antennas are typically planar dipoles printed onto a plastic dielectric substrate (inlay). Power exchange and transmit range is maximized when a tag antenna’s input impedance is conjugate matched to the RFIC input impedance. Since RFIC input impedance includes capacitive reactance, optimized antenna input impedance includes compensating inductive reactance. The T-match network adds inductive matching microstrips to conjugate match the RFIC. Narrowband (± 1. 5 % of center frequency) and broadband (± 5 % of center frequency) lumped element designs also use inductive matching strips. Narrowband, lumped element design is accomplished through Smith Chart matching assuming lumped antenna elements. The broadband lumped element design is accomplished through a circuit transformation to an equivalent network and tuning the transformed circuit to resonate from 865 MHz to 955 MHz, with a center frequency of 910 MHz. This thesis demonstrates a start-to-finish design process for narrow (± 1. 5 % of center frequency) and broadband (± 5 % of center frequency) RFID tag antennas [3]. Furthermore, antenna matching element geometries are parametrically swept to characterize input impedance frequency response. Thesis accomplishments include (a) narrow and broadband antenna designs, (b) Keysight’s Advanced Design System (ADS) Momentum simulations, (c) antenna fabrication, and (d) differential probe impedance setup and antenna impedance measurements.
