5|$|Marvel has {{featured}} Spider-Man {{in several}} comic book series, {{the first and}} longest-lasting of which is titled The Amazing Spider-Man.

In the 2010s, he joins the Avengers, Marvel's flagship superhero team. Spider-Man's nemesis Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014, following a <b>body</b> <b>swap</b> plot in which Peter appears to die. Separately, Marvel has also published books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in an alternate universe; and Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, which depicts the teenager Miles Morales, who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's supposed death. Miles is later brought into mainstream continuity, where he works alongside Peter.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{amount of}} evidence {{has shown that}} embodiment of a virtual body via visuo-tactile stimulation can lead to an altered perception of body and object size. The current study aimed to investigate whether virtual reality (VR) <b>body</b> <b>swapping</b> {{can be an effective}} tool for modifying the enduring memory of the body. The experimental sample included 21 female participants who were asked to estimate the width and circumference of different body parts before any kind of stimulation and after two types of <b>body</b> <b>swapping</b> illusions (“synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation” and “asynchronous visuo-tactile stimulation”). Findings revealed that after participants embodied a virtual body with a skinny belly (independently of the type of visuo-tactile stimulation), there was an update of the stored representation of the body: participants reported a decrease in the ratio between estimated and actual body measures for most of the body parts considered. Based on the Allocentric Lock Theory, these findings provide first evidence that VR <b>body</b> <b>swapping</b> is able to induce a change in the memory of the body. This knowledge may be potentially useful for patients suffering from eating and weight disorders...|$|R
