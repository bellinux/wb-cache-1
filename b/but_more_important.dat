The players knew it was going on, and the owners knew it was going on. <b>But</b> <b>more</b> <b>important,</b> the players knew that the owners knew—and they knew the owners were doing nothing about it for fear of a scandal that might damage organized baseball. Under such conditions it quite obviously did not pay to be honest.|$|E
25|$|<b>But</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> to the {{operation}} of the ODBC system is the DM's concept of a Data Source Name (DSN). DSNs collect additional information needed to connect to a specific data source, versus the DBMS itself. For instance, the same MySQL driver can be used to connect to any MySQL server, but the connection information to connect to a local private server is different from the information needed to connect to an internet-hosted public server. The DSN stores this information in a standardized format, and the DM provides this to the driver during connection requests. The DM also includes functionality to present a list of DSNs using human readable names, and to select them at run-time to connect to different resources.|$|E

500|$|Cyanide {{complexes}} are technically organometallic <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> are carbonyl complexes and {{sandwich and}} half-sandwich compounds. [...] The premier iron(0) compound is iron pentacarbonyl, Fe(CO)5, {{which is used}} to produce carbonyl iron powder, a highly reactive form of metallic iron. Thermolysis of iron pentacarbonyl gives the trinuclear cluster, triiron dodecacarbonyl. Collman's reagent, disodium tetracarbonylferrate, is a useful reagent for organic chemistry; it contains iron in the −2 oxidation state. Cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl dimer contains iron in the rare +1 oxidation state.|$|E

Thus the rain forests carpeting Kohala are vital to the supply of groundwater on the island. The role of Kohala's ecosystem in supporting water flow has long been recognized. As early as 1902, US Forester E. M. Griffith wrote [...] "Forest protection means not only increasing the rainfall, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> still, conserving the water supply. The future welfare and agricultural prosperity of the Hawaiian Islands depends upon {{the preservation of the}} forest." ...|$|E

500|$|The Scout uniform is {{a widely}} {{recognized}} characteristic of Scouting. In the words of Baden-Powell at the 1937 World Jamboree, it [...] "hides all differences of social standing in a country and makes for equality; <b>but,</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> still, it covers differences of country and race and creed, and makes all {{feel that they are}} members with one another of the one great brotherhood". The original uniform, still widely recognized, consisted of a khaki button-up shirt, shorts, and a broad-brimmed campaign hat. Baden-Powell also wore shorts, because he believed that being dressed like a Scout helped to reduce the age-imposed distance between adult and youth. Uniform shirts are now frequently blue, orange, red or green and shorts are frequently replaced by long trousers all year or only under cold weather.|$|E

He had been under close surveillance since the early 1940s, his home and office bugged, his phone tapped and his mail opened. The FBI furnished Oppenheimer's political enemies with incriminating evidence about his Communist ties. These enemies included Strauss, an AEC commissioner who had long harbored resentment against Oppenheimer both for his activity in opposing the hydrogen bomb and for his humiliation of Strauss before Congress some years earlier; regarding Strauss's opposition to the export of radioactive isotopes to other nations, Oppenheimer had memorably categorized these as [...] "less important than electronic devices <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than, let us say, vitamins".|$|E
500|$|The Monster and Other Stories was {{the last}} {{collection}} of Crane's work to be published during his lifetime. [...] In the mid-20th century, the novella received a resurgence of critical attention, especially in regard to studies of race relations in late 19th-century New York. [...] Critic Chester L. Wolford wrote that the story [...] "reveals truths not socially accepted for almost another hundred years. [...] The story is, indeed, an excoriation of social conditions for the blacks, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>important...</b> it is an excoriation of all communities, all societies, in all places and all times." [...] African-American author Ralph Ellison called The Monster, alongside Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, [...] "one of {{the parents of the}} modern American novel". [...] In a 1999 article, critic James Nagel stated that [...] "no other work of short fiction in the decade was more important thematically, and nothing until William Faulkner's [...] "The Bear" [...] so enriched the genre of the United States. [...] Screenwriter and director Albert Band adapted Crane's novella for the 1959 film Face of Fire, starring Cameron Mitchell as Dr. Trescott and James Whitmore as Johnson. [...] Unlike in the original story, Johnson was depicted as white, and his first name was changed from Henry to Monk.|$|E

500|$|Indian Jaguars {{were quite}} {{different}} from the RAF ones. The Adour Mk 811 engines were soon adopted, in the HAL production line (the previous Jaguars made in UK had the earlier Mk 804), giving 8,400 lbf each. There were R-550 Magic 1 or 2 in rails over the wings. <b>But</b> <b>more</b> <b>important,</b> the NAWASS, even if very modern in conception, was replaced because it was found quite unreliable. RAF was already upgrading the system with the modern Ferranti Type 1024 INS, but to India was offered the 1024E (export, less powerful version). So IAF pursued instead the development of an total new nav-attack system, called DARIN, that combined several technology from France, UK and other sources. This system was about ten times more reliable and even more precise than the older NAWASS and all the IAF Jaguar had it as standard system. The IAF was proud of this improvement in the Jaguar effectiveness [...] and DARIN is still upgraded in new versions. Jaguar was found a long range, fast, stable and effective strike aircraft in IAF service; another important upgrade was the Maritime Strike version, [...] fitted with a radar (the French Agave) and powerful British anti-ship missiles, produced in a very limited number (12). The only real issue with Jaguar is about the lack of power at altitude, especially with heavy ordnance on board.|$|E
500|$|Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. It {{was called a}} [...] "masterpiece" [...] by several reviewers who viewed it as {{a departure from the}} mainstream, hip hop-oriented R of the time. Maxwell was also compared to soul singers of the 1960s and 1970s. Writing for Vibe, OJ Lima said the record was a [...] "refreshing detour from hump-bouncin' '90s R", while Dimitri Ehrlich from Entertainment Weekly wrote that Maxwell [...] "smooths hip-hop's and soul's edges, proving that black dance music doesn't automatically mean ghetto culture." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News called it [...] "one of the few modern sex albums to offer a sense of succor", and Urban Latino hailed it as [...] "one of the most soulful releases of the year", writing that Maxwell exhibited [...] "the soul of Curtis Mayfield, the poetics of Beni More and the stage presence of Michael Jackson, pre-Thriller". In American Visions, Michael George wrote, [...] "In an age where young, black artists are criticized (often rightly so) for misogynistic lyrics, Maxwell's focus on commitment is refreshing. <b>But</b> <b>more</b> <b>important,</b> he can flat-out sing." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Arion Berger later said, [...] " [...] laid-back romanticism has heat at its core and a powerful groove that grounds the music: By varying the push of the beat but retaining the central mellow vibe, Maxwell creates a sound as felicitous on headphones {{as it is in the}} bedroom." [...] Peter Shapiro was more critical, panning Maxwell's lyrics and calling the album an [...] "overly mannered pastiche of early 70s soul ... all style and no substance". In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau jokingly accused Maxwell of [...] "expiring of Afrocentric texturitis", while rating the album a [...] "dud", which indicated [...] "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought".|$|E
