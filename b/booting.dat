5|$|Microsoft Windows {{keeps the}} system {{real-time}} clock in local time. This causes several problems, including compatibility when multi <b>booting</b> with operating systems {{that set the}} clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi <b>booting</b> different Windows versions, such as with a rescue boot disk. This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a Windows registry entry RealTimeIsUniversal that had been introduced many years earlier, when Windows NT supported RISC machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained. Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Unix, Plan 9 was {{designed}} with graphics in mind. After <b>booting,</b> a Plan 9 terminal {{will run the}} rio windowing system, in which the user can create new windows displaying rc. Graphical programs invoked from this shell replace it in its window.|$|E

50|$|Thigh-high <b>boots,</b> known also as thigh-length <b>boots</b> {{or simply}} thigh <b>boots,</b> are <b>boots</b> that extend above the knees. Other terms for this {{footwear}} include over-the-knee <b>boots</b> (abbreviated OTK boots; the full term {{is also used}} for the 15th century riding <b>boots</b> for men, later adopted by women) and, especially when cuffed, pirate <b>boots.</b> Lengths vary from reaching just over the knee to reaching almost to the crotch (referred to as crotch <b>boots</b> or crotch-high <b>boots).</b>|$|R
5|$|BootX is a {{software-based}} bootloader {{designed and}} developed by Apple Inc. {{for use on}} the company's Macintosh computer range. BootX is used to prepare the computer for use, by loading all required device drivers and then starting-up Mac OS X by <b>booting</b> the kernel on all PowerPC Macintoshes running the Mac OS X 10.2 operating system or later versions.|$|E
5|$|To {{make the}} boot loader {{appealing}} to other operating system developers, Apple added features to allow {{flexibility in the}} <b>booting</b> process such as network boot using TFTP and load Mach-O and ELF formatted kernels. BootX can also boot from HFS, HFS+, UFS and ext2 formatted volumes. The boot loader can be manipulated at startup by holding down various key combinations to alter the <b>booting</b> process. Such functions include Verbose Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and V key at startup, which replaces the default Apple logo with text-based information on the boot process and Single User Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and S, which, depending on the operating system, may boot into a more basic command-line or text-based version of the operating system, to facilitate maintenance and recovery action. The ROM can also be set to require a password to access these technical functions using the OpenFirmware interface.|$|E
5|$|Petya {{was first}} {{discovered}} in March 2016; unlike {{other forms of}} encrypting ransomware, the malware aimed to infect the master boot record, installing a payload which encrypts the file tables of the NTFS file system the next time that the infected system boots, blocking the system from <b>booting</b> into Windows at all until the ransom is paid. Check Point reported that despite what it believed to be an innovative evolution in ransomware design, it had resulted in relatively-fewer infections than other ransomware active {{around the same time}} frame.|$|E
50|$|Variants {{and similar}} <b>boots</b> include {{a type of}} riding <b>boot</b> called jodhpur <b>boots</b> as well as {{assorted}} work <b>boot</b> designs, including Australian work <b>boots</b> like those manufactured by Blundstone and other companies: such work <b>boots</b> may have steel toes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Boot</b> socks are {{a type of}} sock {{suitable}} for wearing with <b>boots.</b> Typically made from a knitted material, popular styles of knit currently are the cable and fairisle knit. <b>Boot</b> socks provide additional comfort and warmth in colder weather. <b>Boots</b> are often worn by both genders, with military <b>boots,</b> brogue <b>boots</b> and hiking <b>boots</b> all being popular styles to pair with <b>boot</b> socks. <b>Boot</b> socks vary in lengths, ranging from normal sized socks to knee high length socks.|$|R
5000|$|Bovver <b>boots,</b> Doc Martens <b>boots</b> {{and army}} <b>boots</b> were adopted by skinheads and punks {{as part of}} their typical dress and have {{migrated}} to more mainstream fashion, including women's wear. As a more rugged alternative to dress shoes, dress <b>boots</b> may be worn (though these can be more formal than shoes). Fashionable <b>boots</b> for women may exhibit all the variations seen in other fashion footwear: tapered or spike heels, platform soles, pointed toes, zipper closures and the like. The popularity of <b>boots</b> as fashion footwear ebbs and flows. Singer Nancy Sinatra popularized the fad of women wearing <b>boots</b> in the late 1960s with her song [...] "These <b>boots</b> are made for walking". They were popular in the 1960s and 1970s (particularly knee-high <b>boots),</b> but diminished in popularity {{towards the end of the}} 20th century. In the 2010s, they are experiencing a resurgence in popularity, especially designs with a long bootleg. <b>Boot</b> bolos, <b>boot</b> bracelets, <b>boot</b> straps, <b>boot</b> chains, and <b>boot</b> harnesses are used to decorate <b>boots.</b> Sandal <b>boots</b> also exist.|$|R
5|$|Some {{payloads}} consist simply of {{an application}} designed to lock or restrict the system until payment is made, typically by setting the Windows Shell to itself, or even modifying the {{master boot record}} and/or partition table to prevent the operating system from <b>booting</b> until it is repaired. The most sophisticated payloads encrypt files, with many using strong encryption to encrypt the victim's files {{in such a way}} that only the malware author has the needed decryption key.|$|E
5|$|The chipset {{brought a}} 1066MHz system bus, use of DDR3 system memory, and {{integrated}} Nvidia GeForce 9400M graphics. Other changes include a display which uses LED backlights (replacing the fluorescent tube backlights {{used in the}} previous model) and arsenic-free glass, a new Mini DisplayPort (replacing the polycarbonate MacBook's mini-DVI port), a multi-touch glass trackpad which also acts as the mouse button, {{and the removal of}} the FireWire 400 port (thus it doesn't support Target Disk Mode, used for data transfers or operating system repairs without <b>booting</b> the system).|$|E
5|$|Some NTFS {{features}} are not supported in ReFS, including object IDs, short names, file compression, file level encryption (EFS), user data transactions, hard links, extended attributes, and disk quotas. Sparse files are supported. Support for named streams is not implemented in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, {{though it was}} later added in Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. ReFS does not itself offer data deduplication. Dynamic disks with mirrored or striped volumes are replaced with mirrored or striped storage pools provided by Storage Spaces. In Windows Server 2012, automated error-correction with integrity streams is only supported on mirrored spaces; automatic recovery on parity spaces was added in Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. <b>Booting</b> from ReFS is not supported either.|$|E

50|$|In {{operating}} system <b>boot</b> manager programs, chain loading {{is used to}} pass control from the <b>boot</b> manager to a <b>boot</b> sector. The target <b>boot</b> sector is loaded in from disk, replacing the in-memory <b>boot</b> sector from which the <b>boot</b> manager itself was bootstrapped, and executed.|$|R

5|$|The MacBook Pro {{comes with}} the {{successor}} to BIOS, Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) 1.1. EFI handles <b>booting</b> differently from BIOS-based computers, but provides backwards compatibility, allowing dual and triple boot configurations. In addition to OS X, the Microsoft Windows operating system is installable on Intel x86-based Apple computers. Officially, this is limited to both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 with the necessary hardware drivers included with the Boot Camp software. Other x86 operating systems such as Linux are also unofficially supported. This is {{made possible by the}} presence of the Intel architecture as provided by the CPU and the BIOS emulation Apple has provided on top of EFI.|$|E
5|$|USB {{implements}} {{connections to}} storage devices using {{a set of}} standards called the USB mass storage device class (MSC or UMS). This was at first intended for traditional magnetic and optical drives and has been extended to support flash drives. It has also been extended to support {{a wide variety of}} novel devices as many systems can be controlled with the familiar metaphor of file manipulation within directories. The process of making a novel device look like a familiar device is also known as extension. The ability to boot a write-locked SD card with a USB adapter is particularly advantageous for maintaining the integrity and non-corruptible, pristine state of the <b>booting</b> medium.|$|E
5|$|Mickal {{showed his}} {{versatility}} {{in the first}} game of the 1933 season against Rice, tossing a 40-yard pass on the first play from scrimmage to end Pete Burge and <b>booting</b> punts of 76 and 61 yards. In week four against Arkansas Mickal completed touchdown passes of 48 and 57 yards and ran for a 15-yard touchdown, as he was responsible for every score in the 20–0 win over the eventual Southwest Conference champion Razorbacks. He scored the only touchdown of LSU's final game of the season, against Tennessee, with a goal line dive into the end zone. He also kicked the extra point for the 7–0 victory, and completed the season having successfully made every extra point he attempted. The Tigers finished undefeated with three ties in their first season as members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). After the season, Mickal was named to the United Press (UP) All-SEC second team as a halfback.|$|E
50|$|Other <b>boot</b> loaders used by {{third-party}} <b>boot</b> managers (such as GRUB or XOSL) can {{be installed}} to a master <b>boot</b> record and can <b>boot</b> primary or extended partitions, which {{do not have the}} <b>boot</b> flag set.|$|R
50|$|Combat <b>boots</b> are {{military}} <b>boots</b> {{designed to}} be worn by soldiers during combat or combat training, as opposed to during parades and other ceremonial duties. Modern combat <b>boots</b> are {{designed to provide a}} combination of grip, ankle stability, and foot protection suitable for a rugged environment. They are traditionally made of hardened and sometimes waterproofed leather. Today, many combat <b>boots</b> incorporate technologies originating in civilian hiking <b>boots,</b> such as Gore-Tex nylon side panels, which improve ventilation and comfort. They are also often specialized for certain climates and conditions, such as jungle <b>boots,</b> desert <b>boots,</b> and cold weather <b>boots</b> as well as specific uses, such as tanker <b>boots</b> and jump <b>boots.</b>|$|R
50|$|High-heeled <b>boots</b> help to {{elongate}} the calf, {{creating a}} longer-legged appearance {{which is generally}} considered to be more sexually attractive. The length of the <b>boot</b> shafts also adds to this impression. <b>Boots</b> have been displayed in magazines such as Leg Show and there are also magazines and websites aimed directly at this fetish. <b>Boot</b> fetishism may be accompanied by a fetish for the material from which it is made, such as leather, rubber, or latex. <b>Boot</b> fetishism is often targeted at fashion <b>boots</b> and riding <b>boots</b> but there are also <b>boots</b> expressly made for fetish purposes, such as ballet <b>boots</b> and some forms of thigh-high <b>boots.</b>|$|R

50|$|Over-the-knee <b>boots</b> (or cuissardes, {{which include}} thighboots, top <b>boots,</b> hip-boots, and waders) are long <b>boots</b> that fully or partly cover the knee. Originally {{created as a}} man's riding <b>boot</b> in the 15th century, {{in the latter part}} of the 20th century, the style was redefined as a fashion <b>boot</b> for women. Over-the-knee <b>boots</b> are also used as a work <b>boot</b> in {{circumstances}} requiring additional protection for the legs (e.g. fishing waders).|$|R
50|$|<b>Boot</b> socks {{can be worn}} {{for comfort}} or for fashion.The turn up of trousers, showing a dash of the <b>boot</b> sock is a trend which has been {{highlighted}} by various fashion sources. Rolling the <b>boot</b> socks down in a scruffy way adds a unique touch to a look. <b>Boot</b> socks are also used for the obvious function of warmth and comfort. Also <b>boot</b> socks are worn with knee high <b>boots</b> and knee high riding <b>boots</b> with knee length or over the knee length <b>boot</b> socks. The socks are worn alone or over tights. leggings or jeans and are scrunched {{at the top of}} the <b>boots.</b> This style of wearing <b>boot</b> socks is fashionable with young girls, tweens, teens, college age girls and women. <b>Boots</b> are seen as hard wearing footwear and aren't as comfortable to wear as most shoes,so wearing a decent sock is crucial. Wearing the <b>boot</b> socks have become popular with the Wellington <b>Boot,</b> hiking <b>boots</b> and wearing them for any other sporting activity involving walking long distances.|$|R
50|$|<b>Boots</b> was {{established}} in 1849, by John <b>Boot.</b> After his father's death in 1860, Jesse <b>Boot,</b> aged 10, helped his mother run the family's herbal medicine shop in Nottingham, which was incorporated as <b>Boot</b> and Co. Ltd. in 1883, becoming <b>Boots</b> Pure Drug Company Ltd. in 1888. In 1920, Jesse <b>Boot</b> sold the company to the American United Drug Company. However, because of deteriorating economic circumstances in North America <b>Boots</b> was sold back into British hands in 1933. The grandson of the founder, John <b>Boot,</b> who inherited the title Baron Trent from his father, headed the company. The <b>Boots</b> Pure Drug Company name was changed to The <b>Boots</b> Company Limited in 1971.|$|R
