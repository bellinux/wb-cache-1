40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{and thermal}} {{evolution of a}} gas shell, swept by a supernova in first pregalactic objects, is discussed with taking into account primordial H 2 and HD chemistry and by using an analytical solution with the explosion energy and the background density in the host cloud.

The Jeans masses in the fragments decrease well below a solar mass before the fragments contract to be optically thick to the H 2 and HD lines. Accordingly, low-mass stars, which survived to date, is expected even in the primordial clouds with the lowest masses of ∼ 106 M.

In this paper,flow field characters of dual-cavity scramjet combustor were analyzed in details without and with combustion. The results show that, under the interaction of cavity flow and fuel injection, two sizes of vortexes were formed in the upstream cavity after combustion. The bigger vortex provides a stable flame and the smaller one protects the upstream cavity back wall from heat in a certain extent. Additionally, the unburned fuel was <b>blew</b> <b>away</b> <b>to</b> the downstream cavity for a further combustion as soon as it meets high-speed main stream, which is helpful to improve combustion efficiency and to make the scramjet combustor shorter.
