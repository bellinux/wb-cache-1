5|$|The next morning, on 24 December 1972, two {{tracking}} teams {{arrived at}} Whistlefield to assist Buttenshaw and Sachse in a 360-degree search: one {{was from the}} SAS, and led by Ron Marillier, while {{the other was a}} British South Africa Police (BSAP) team including tracking dogs. The security forces searched for tracks while also investigating reported sightings. The tracks of the ZANLA fighters were discovered on 27 December on the western side of the farm and the trackers asked Buttenshaw and Sachse to bring the vehicles carrying the heavy equipment around to meet them. On the way the truck carrying Buttenshaw ran over a mine with one of its rear wheels, causing it to detonate. Buttenshaw himself, who was sitting on the bonnet of the vehicle, was thrown clear but Corporal Norman Moore and Trooper Pete Botha, sitting in the back, were not as fortunate, taking the brunt of the blast. Captain Gordon Holloway, <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> <b>and</b> Trooper Rod Boden in the passenger seat went into severe shock but were ultimately unharmed. Moore, on the other hand, died two days later from his wounds, while Botha survived but lost both legs.|$|E
25|$|On 24 June 1922, {{two months}} after the signing of the Treaty of Rapallo (which renounced German {{territorial}} claims from World War I), Rathenau was assassinated. On this Saturday morning, Rathenau had himself chauffeured from his house in Berlin-Grunewald to the Foreign Office in Wilhelmstraße. During the trip, his NAG-Convertible was passed by a Mercedes-Touring car with Ernst Werner Techow <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> Erwin Kern and Hermann Fischer on the backseats. Kern opened fire with a MP 18-submachine gun at close range, killing Rathenau almost instantly, while Fischer threw a hand grenade into the car before Techow quickly drove them away. Also involved in the plot were Techow's younger brother Hans Gerd Techow, future writer Ernst von Salomon, and Willi Günther (aided and abetted by seven others, some of them schoolboys). All conspirators were members of the ultra-nationalist secret Organisation Consul (O.C.). A memorial stone in the Königsallee in Grunewald marks the scene of the crime.|$|E
500|$|In the mid- to late 1970s, HIAG {{attempted}} to commission a favorable biography of Peiper, to stop [...] "the bad rumors", {{according to a}} HIAG official. [...] "We must steadfastly remain <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> direct this book ourselves, otherwise [...] will do it", Harzer wrote to a fellow member in 1976. HIAG contemplated approaching (or approached) Herbert Reinecker, a prolific screenwriter who had served in a propaganda company (...) of the Waffen-SS, but nothing came out of it.|$|E
50|$|The {{radiator}} {{was mounted}} vertically, directly <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> front <b>wheels,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> semi-elliptic leaf springs were of substantial construction.|$|R
5000|$|The initial {{locomotives}} were of 2-2-2 wheel arrangement {{to accommodate}} the extra length. However, with the outside cylinders, the engines were extremely unsteady, swaying from side to side. This led Stephenson to bring <b>the</b> rear <b>wheels</b> forward in <b>the</b> 4-2-0 formation, with the cylinders between <b>the</b> leading <b>wheels.</b> Such an engine was the [...] "Great A" [...] which {{took part in the}} Gauge Trials. This however, left <b>the</b> firebox <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> was therefore limited in size and weight. Moreover, the long rigid chassis made bends difficult to negotiate and damaged the track.|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{identified}} by a [...] "Ford 300" [...] badge on each front fender just <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> wells <b>and</b> [...] "F-O-R-D" [...] in small block {{letters on the}} trunk lid. The series was available only as a 2- or 4-door pillared sedan.|$|R
500|$|The {{beginning}} of the episode, in which Homer has a dream of himself as an ape, is {{a reference to the}} [...] sequence from the 1968 science-fiction film [...] The Simpsons director David Silverman had difficulties with making the ape resemble Homer and struggled with the design for several hours. After hurting Lisa's feelings at talent show, Homer watches old home movies of him and Lisa, including one in which a young Homer is seen watching Fantasy Island on television instead of paying attention to Lisa's taking her first steps. The scene in which Lisa wakes up in her bed and discovers the pony lying next to her is a reference to a scene in the 1972 film The Godfather, in which Jack Woltz awakens to discover the severed head of his favorite horse placed in his bed. The musical chords used in the episode are the same as in the film but shortened. While driving home from the Kwik-E-Mart, Homer falls asleep <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> dreams that he is in Slumberland, drawn in the style of Winsor McCay's Little Nemo in Slumberland. The song [...] "Golden Slumbers" [...] by The Beatles plays during the sequence.|$|E
2500|$|HKS GT-R {{would hold}} a drag series record {{for several years}} in there drag series [...] making a record win of 7.671-second pass at Sendai Hi-Land Raceway with Tetsuya Kawasaki <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> taking {{it to be the}} World's fastest AWD car.|$|E
2500|$|After {{succeeding}} {{with two}} stores {{at such a}} distance (and with the postwar baby boom in full effect), Sam became enthusiastic about scouting more locations and opening more Ben Franklin franchises. (Also, having spent countless hours <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> <b>and</b> with his close brother James [...] "Bud" [...] Walton having been a pilot in the war, he decided to buy a small second-hand airplane. Both he and his son John would later become accomplished pilots and log thousands of hours scouting locations and expanding the family business.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{six-speed}} transaxle gearbox has computerized {{gear selection}} {{by means of}} levers <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> {{may be used in}} Manual-Normal; Manual-Sport; Automatic-Normal; Automatic-Sport and Wet modes. The gearbox can shift in 175 milliseconds when using Sport mode. The 8C also has a limited slip differential.|$|R
50|$|Marais or Groupe Marais, {{founded in}} 1962 in France, is a {{manufacturer}} of trenchers. The head office and workshop buildings have been located in Durtal since 2001. Marais society via its founder, Jacques Marais is in 1962 <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> trenching <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mechanized laying of cables or flexible pipes process.|$|R
50|$|The Cannone da 149/35 A {{was a heavy}} gun {{which served}} with Italy during World War I and World War II. It was already an old-fashioned weapon when {{introduced}} around 1900. It lacked a recoil system of any kind and could not traverse. The gun recoiled up two ramps placed <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> had to be re-laid after every shot. Wheel plates were added to absorb more recoil energy and to help the gun cross soft ground. Despite these serious drawbacks {{it seems to have}} been produced in large numbers as some 895 were in Italian service on June 1940. Weapons captured by the Germans after the Italian surrender in 1943 seem to have been scrapped or ignored as there is no record of them in German service.|$|R
60|$|A simple break, used in Italy, in {{some parts}} of England and {{probably}} elsewhere, is shown in fig. 3. A rail is lashed to the body of the cart, both before and <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> <b>and</b> is made to press against the wheel. Either both lashings can be tightened at the same time, as at A, A; or only one of them, as at B. When the lashings are loose, the rail rests partly on the nave of the wheel and does not sensibly interfere with its movement.|$|E
60|$|Appleby {{watched them}} languidly {{from where he}} sat <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> <b>and</b> {{wondered}} what lay before him when he glanced towards the dusky coast‐ line. He was, however, not unduly anxious, for he had cut himself adrift from the cramped life he had led, and as yet found the new one pleasant. It needed qualities he felt he possessed, and which, indeed, he had with difficulty held in due subjection in England; while {{the fact that it}} might at any time terminate suddenly caused him no great concern. In the meanwhile the risks and opportunities attached to it had their charm for one who had long found poverty and the restraints of conventionality irksome.|$|E
60|$|Mayne rang his {{telegraph}} and Kit {{went into}} the pilot house. The {{dim light of the}} binnacle lamp touched the compass, but everything else was dark and the windows were down. Kit could see the quartermaster's dark form <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> <b>and</b> the silver shining of the sea. There was a splash as the man on the platform released the whirling hand-lead. When he called the depth Mayne gave an order and the quartermaster pulled round the wheel. The swell was not so smooth now. It ran in steep undulations and in one place to starboard a broad, foaming patch appeared between the rollers. Kit knew the water was shoaling fast as the Rio Negro steamed across the inclined shelf. It was risky work to take her in, because the fire had vanished and there were no marks to steer for. Mayne must trust his compass and his rough calculations.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the new Civic likewise features major design changes. Unlike the split bi-level speedometer and tachometer of its predecessor, the tenth generation Civic consolidates these instruments into a fully customisable, all digital interface incorporating a 7-inch LCD screen positioned directly <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> driver's line of sight.|$|R
50|$|Löw {{lost his}} driver's licence twice, once in 2006 (for one month) {{and once in}} 2014 (for six months) because of his {{reckless}} behaviour <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> (excessive speed <b>and</b> phoning).|$|R
50|$|The Violet 160J was Nissan's most {{successful}} {{car in the}} World Rally Championship. It won the Safari Rally in Kenya from 1979 to 1982 consecutively, all with Shekhar Mehta <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> 1979 <b>and</b> 1980 winners were powered by an SOHC engine; the 1981 and 1982 winners were Violet GT models with a DOHC engine. These Safari records are only matched by the Toyota Celica GT-Four which won the 1992-95 events. Driven by Timo Salonen, the Violet also won the 1980 Rally New Zealand and the 1981 Rallye Côte d'Ivoire.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, the No. 25 raced at Richmond and Chalotte with Kelly Bires <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> Raybestos as the sponsor.|$|E
50|$|The team {{debuted in}} 2011 at Lucas Oil Raceway with Tommy Joe Martins behind the wheel. The team {{returned}} at Iowa Speedway in 2017 with Matt Mills <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> additional races to be determined.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{theories}} of syntax judge subjects to be single constituents, hence the small clauses Bill <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> Sam drunk here should each {{be construed as}} one constituent. Further, small clauses can appear as the complement of with, e.g.: ...|$|E
50|$|The Imp uses an 875 cc all-aluminium power unit, {{adapted by}} Rootes from a Coventry Climax FWMA fire pump engine which had enjoyed some racing success, but {{significantly}} different {{in areas such}} as cylinder head design. It is mounted <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> canted over at 45°, keeping the centre of gravity low to optimise road-holding.|$|R
50|$|Further export orders followed. Both nations also {{appreciated}} the all-terrain mobility of the Lynx which {{is enhanced by}} the capability to raise or lower the central pair of wheels depending on terrain condition, especially in sandy or muddy ground. All versions of the ERC are also equipped with two hydrojets <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> require no preparation for amphibious operations.|$|R
50|$|The freight harness, {{often an}} H-back harness {{with a wide}} chestband and {{sometimes}} extra padding, {{is designed to help}} the dog pull heavy weights efficiently, and may feature a spreader bar <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> dogs <b>and</b> before <b>the</b> sled or cart. The straps form an 'H' or ladder-like effect across the back of the dog. These harnesses help distribute the weight of the cargo over a broader body area.|$|R
5000|$|Motor Mania is {{a cartoon}} made by Walt Disney Productions in 1950. In this madcap {{motoring}} animation, Goofy (during his [...] "Everyman" [...] period) transforms into a Mr. Hyde-type split personality, {{when he gets}} <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> provides the lowdown on how to not drive safely.|$|E
50|$|Thomas gets <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> embarks on {{a journey}} to connect one final time {{with each of the}} {{meaningful}} people in his life. Hating the man he's become, he ends the tour by committing suicide - - and event foretold in the film's opening narration (from Netflix).|$|E
50|$|On October 24, 2013, {{while riding}} his bicycle up Millcreek Canyon in Salt Lake Valley, Utah, Quinn was hit head on by an elderly driver who became distracted <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> <b>and</b> crossed into {{oncoming}} traffic. Quinn was transported {{to an area}} hospital in critical condition where he later died from his injuries.|$|E
50|$|The Region 1 DVD was {{released}} on 10 March 2009. It is in anamorphic widescreen format with an audio track in English and subtitles in English and Spanish. Bonus features include commentary by screenwriter/director Mike Leigh, <b>Behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wheel</b> of Happy-Go-Lucky, <b>and</b> Happy-in-Character.|$|R

60|$|Devine drove a birch log <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> {{then ran}} to the leaders' heads and cracked his whip, while Harding called to the pole-team. For a few moments the {{battering}} hoofs churned up the sloppy trail and the wagon groaned and shook, the horses floundering and slipping without moving it. Then with a harsh creak <b>the</b> high <b>wheels</b> began to turn and they slowly struggled up the hill. Harness rattled, chain and clevis rang, the steam from the toiling animals rose in a thin cloud, and white smears streaked their coats as they strained at the collar. The men were red in face and panting hard, but as they fought the grade they broke into breathless shouts. Harding was sparing of the whip; {{but this was not}} a time to be weakly merciful, when the load might overpower his teams and, running back, drag them over the edge. Nor dare he stop again and subject the animals to the cruel effort of restarting. They must get up somehow before their strength gave out.|$|R
50|$|The article {{opened with}} an {{explanation}} that the Trevi {{was designed as}} a means to restore confidence lost during the Lancia Beta rust debacle where sales fell from 11,000 a year in 1977 to 7,000 in 1980. The car was reviewed under several headings: Performance, Economy, Noise, Road Behaviour, Brakes, <b>Behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>and</b> Living With the Car.|$|E
50|$|The Guidelines {{state that}} driving can bring out {{primitive}} behavior in drivers, {{which leads to}} road rage, rude gestures, speeding, drinking behind the wheel, cursing, blasphemy, impoliteness, and intentional violation of the highway code. The Guidelines encourage drivers to obey the highway code, pray <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> recite the rosary, which the Guidelines insist would not distract the driver's attention.|$|E
50|$|The Autorlando Porsche, {{which started}} from pole-position with Richard Lietz <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> <b>and</b> the {{identical}} Land Motorsport entry, driven by Marc Basseng, {{were able to}} pull a gap over Claudia Hürtgen with the Al Faisal Racing BMW Z4 Coupé M on the first few laps. On lap seven, there was the first lead change as Basseng managed to overtake Lietz.|$|E
5000|$|The {{requirement}} for locomotives {{that could be}} converted from [...] to [...] without major re-engineering led {{to the introduction of}} Mikado locomotives by the Victorian Railways (VR) in the 1920s. Whereas previous 2-8-0 Consolidation type locomotives featured long, narrow fireboxes between the frames that made gauge conversion impractical, the N class light lines and X class heavy goods locomotives both featured wide fireboxes positioned <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> coupled <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> above <b>the</b> frames.|$|R
5000|$|In October 13, 2014, Brazeau {{was charged}} with {{intoxicated}} driving. An officer investigated an unconscious Brazeau as he parked and was seated <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> he detected a strong scent of liquor. Brazeau tested for [...]16 BAC at the police station. He is officially charged with:violating bail conditions and intoxicated driving. A knife was found in his vehicle, and he {{was charged with}} weapons possession violating bail conditions. Brazeau was court ordered to two months of detox rehabilitation as he awaits trial.|$|R
50|$|The {{first eight}} hours {{saw a lot}} of action that {{involved}} some of the possible contenders for a podium finish. Among the early retirements were the Auto Racing Club Bratislava-Porsche (Miroslav Konopka-Oliver Morley-Sean Edwards-Richard Cvörnjek) and the Besaplast Racing Team-Porsche (Franjo Kovac-Martin Tschornia-Kurt Thiim-Roland Asch-Sebastian Asch). The latter team that finished third in last year's race was out of contention after their car caught fire on the main straight with Martin Tschornia <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> seven <b>and</b> a half hours into the race. The unfortunate driver escaped unscathed, but the car was damaged beyond immediate repair.|$|R
