40|$|The {{substantiation}} {{for using}} techniques of fish raw material canning has been presented, raw fish being caught or farmed in aquaculture. The main problems in raw fish canning have been reviewed, including {{significant reduction in}} thermolabile vitamins in the ultimate product {{as compared with the}} raw material due to the thermal processing. Promising canning technique – vacuum drying – has been proposed. This technique makes possible to reduce the temperature of thermal processing down to 50 … 55 °С and significantly enlarge preservation of thermolabile vitamins from the raw fish. Sampling of raw materials, semi-finished products, finished products, including preparation for analysis has been conducted by standard methods. Disadvantages of this way have been found, it is low energy efficiency of the process. The way to intensify the vacuum drying of aquatic organisms has been proposed based on the method of preliminary pore-forming due to augmenting the area of moisture evaporation. The design of the pilot plant has been proposed in order to research the process of pore forming and vacuum drying. Target species for processing have been suggested. They are as follows: Azov goby (fillet) for food products and <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>sprat</b> for feeds. The recipes of the feed mixture for granulated floating food for trout have been developed. The results of the first series of the pilot research have been provided.

In this study, we have implemented a coupled, basin-scale circulation-biogeochemical model and used its output to feed a food web model to test near-future changes that may be observed in the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> ecosystem under the influence of contemporary fisheries exploitation conditions. In order to test model response to changes in climate and related drivers, the future climate scenario (2015 – 2020) simulation was compared to the present day (2000 – 2014) simulation. Likewise, to test the sensitivity of the higher trophic level food web model to changes in fishing pressure, a future estimate of fishing pressure was projected based on its respective contemporary value and applied to each fish stock. Using these models, fishing mortality rates that could produce the maximum sustainable yield (FMSY) in future years 2015 – 2020 and ensure the long-term recovery of the predatory fish stocks of the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> are predicted. Future projections suggest that all fish stock will decrease in all the regions of the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> except for <b>sprat.</b> Anchovy is expected to show the highest decrease in biomass.

40|$|Purpose. To investigate, {{analyze and}} {{summarize}} the biological indices of commercial fish {{species in the}} main fishery water bodies of Dnіpropetrovsk region for the last 10 years. Methodology. Field data were collected in the Zaporizhzhia reservoir during 2003 – 2013 using a standard set of monitoring fishing gears (gill nets with mesh size a= 30 – 120 mm). Juvenile fish were caught in third decade of June - first decade of August using the juvenile fish beach seine with a length of 10 m. Processing of ichthyological materials was conducted according to generally accepted methods. Findings. When comparing the biological indices of fish in the Zaporіzhzhia reservoir with {{the data for the}} past decade reflected in the normative documents, we found significant changes in the population of pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) and gibel carp (Carassius gibelio), which concern the average fish weight, fertility and the relative proportion of females in the spawning stock. Roach (Rutilus rutilus), perch (Perca fluviatilis), and gibel carp are characterized a reduced number of spawning events. The biological indices of bream (Abramis brama), common carp (Cyprinus), pike (Esox lucius) and catfish (Silurus glanis) populations remain virtually unchanged during the study period. As for biological indices of <b>Black</b> and Caspian <b>Sea</b> <b>sprat,</b> rudd, gobies and crayfish, the information on these species in the relevant regulatory documents is missing, so {{it is not possible to}} assess the dynamics of their changes. Due to an inventory of small fishery water bodies we received the information on the biological indicators of major species, which can also be used for updating the normative database. Originality. For the first time we summarized the characteristic of fish fauna in major fishery water bodies of Dnepropetrovsk region and analyzed main indices, which define the conditions of fish stock development and exploitation of aquatic living aquatic resources in fishery water bodies.
