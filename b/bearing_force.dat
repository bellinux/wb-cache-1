Why {{lines of}} this kind are beautiful, I {{endeavored}} to show in the [...] "Modern Painters;" [...] but one point, there omitted, may be mentioned here,--that almost all these lines are expressive of action of force of some kind, while the circle is a line of limitation or support. In leafage they mark the forces of its growth and expansion, but some among the most beautiful of them are described by bodies variously in motion, or subjected to force; as by projectiles in the air, by the particles of water in a gentle current, by planets in motion in an orbit, by their satellites, if the actual path of the satellite in space be considered instead of its relation to the planet; by boats, or birds, turning in the water or air, by clouds in various action upon the wind, by sails in the curvatures they assume under its force, and by thousands of other objects moving or <b>bearing</b> <b>force.</b> In the Alisma leaf, q r, the lines through its body, which are of peculiar beauty, mark the different expansions of its fibres, and are, I think, {{exactly the same as}} those which would be traced by the currents of a river entering a lake of the shape of the leaf, at the end where the stalk is, and passing out at its point. Circular curves, on the contrary, are always, I think, curves of limitation or support; that is to say, curves of perfect rest. The cylindrical curve round the stem of a plant binds its fibres together; while the ascent of the stem is in lines of various curvature: so the curve of the horizon and of the apparent heaven, of the rainbow, etc.: and though the reader might imagine that the circular orbit of any moving body, or the curve described by a sling, was a curve of motion, he should observe that the circular character is given to the curve not by the motion, but by the confinement: the circle is the consequence not of the energy of the body, but of its being forbidden to leave the centre; and whenever the whirling or circular motion can be fully impressed on it we obtain instant balance and rest with respect to the centre of the circle.|$|E

50|$|Elastohydrodynamic lubrication: Mostly for nonconforming {{surfaces}} {{or higher}} load conditions, the bodies suffer elastic strains at the contact. Such strain creates a load-bearing area, which provides an almost parallel gap for the fluid to flow through. Much as in hydrodynamic lubrication, {{the motion of}} the contacting bodies generates a flow induced pressure, which acts as the <b>bearing</b> <b>force</b> over the contact area. In such high pressure regimes, the viscosity of the fluid may rise considerably. At full film elastohydrodynamic lubrication the generated lubricant film completely separates the surfaces. Contact between raised solid features, or asperities, can occur, leading to a mixed-lubrication or boundary lubrication regime. In addition to Reynolds equation, elastohydrodynamic theory considers the elastic deflection equation, since in this regime elastic deformation of the surfaces contributes significantly to the lubricant film thickness.|$|E

Moreover, the increase in stiffness as critical speeds were approached caused a large increase in rotor and bearing vibration amplitude over part of the speed range compared to the case of constant-stiffness bearings. Regions of bistable operation were possible, in which the amplitude at a given speed was much larger during rotor acceleration than during deceleration.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{which can be}} used to calculate dynamic gear tooth force and bearing forces. The model includes elastic bearings. The gear mesh stiffness and the path of contact are determined using the deformations of the gears and the bearings. This gives contact outside the plane-of-action and a time-varying working pressure angle. In a numerical example it is found that the only important vibration mode for the gear contact is the one where the gear tooth deformation is dominant. The <b>bearing</b> <b>force</b> variation, however, will be much more affected by the other vibration modes. The influence of the friction force is also studied. The friction has no dynamic influence on the gear contact force or on the <b>bearing</b> <b>force</b> in the gear mesh line-of-action direction. On the other hand, the changing of sliding directions in the pitch point is a source for critical oscillations of the bearings in the gear tooth frictional direction.

As a result, a comparison between the spectral method, the finite difference method, and the finite element method is performed to investigate which method is more adapted to dynamical analysis of the bearing. It is observed that the spectral method has the advantage of having a reasonable simulation time for any eccentricity magnitude with a moderate number of interpolation points.
