5|$|In {{developing}} the mythology behind the film, the creators used many inspirations. For instance, several character names are near-anagrams: Elly Kedward (The Blair Witch) is Edward Kelley, a 16th-century mystic, and Rustin Parr, the fictional 1940s child-murderer, {{began as an}} anagram for Rasputin. Viewers are told that the Blair Witch is, according to legend, the ghost of Elly Kedward, a woman <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Blair Township (latter-day Burkittsville) for witchcraft in 1785. The directors incorporated {{that part of the}} legend, along with allusions to the Salem witch trials and Arthur Miller's 1953 play The Crucible, to play on the themes of injustice done on those who were called witches.|$|E
5|$|John Wheelwright (c.15921679), was a Puritan clergyman in England and America, and {{was most}} noted for being <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Massachusetts Bay Colony during the Antinomian Controversy, and for {{subsequently}} establishing {{the town of}} Exeter, New Hampshire. Born in Lincolnshire, England, {{he was raised in}} a family with substantial means, and received both a B.A. and M.A. at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge where he was a noted athlete and where Oliver Cromwell was a college friend. Ordained in 1619, he became the vicar of the church in Bilsby, Lincolnshire, and held this position for ten years until removed for simony.|$|E

5|$|The {{morning after}} the battle, forty young noblemen from Besançon, {{suspected}} of sympathizing with the Protestant insurgents, were executed after lengthy torture sessions. Other citizens suspected of heresy would receive the same punishment—some were imprisoned; others were <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city, or had their money and possessions taken away. Many citizens were publicly hanged {{in front of the}} city hall. Some Protestants were hanged, beheaded, and quartered, while some others were dragged onto a publicly displayed pile of bodies. Some Protestant corpses were cut up and the pieces exposed on the city gates. Masses were held at St. Jean's Cathedral and St. Stephen's Cathedral of Besançon to celebrate the defeat of the Huguenots.|$|E

Vogue and other major women's and fashion magazines have avoided reviewing or even mentioning the book in their pages.

5|$|Fearful of Hereford's power, Richard {{unjustly}} {{orders that}} his cousin be <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> realm for six years, {{to the dismay}} of the House of Commons and many others. Slowly dying of old age, Gaunt's final advice to Richard, that he put aside his favourites and become a just king, falls on deaf ears. Gaunt dies soon after; Richard becomes increasingly dictatorial and prevents Gaunt's vast inheritance from being granted to Bolingbroke; his banishment is converted to life, though his sons remain in the country. In the wake of these troublesome events, Richard leaves England for Ireland, a decision widely considered folly considering the turmoil England is in. Bolingbroke returns to England and many nobleman flock to his banner; Richard is overthrown.|$|E

5|$|Harley's {{leadership}} {{qualities and}} {{influence on the}} club as captain was commended {{early on in the}} season after his handling of teammate Steve Johnson's off-field discretions. Johnson was <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> team during the pre-season and demoted to the reserves for the first five games of the season. However, he successfully returned to the team and finished the season as a Norm Smith Medallist and All-Australian. Harley's leadership influence on the team was reflected in his finishing fourth in the AFLPA Best Captain award during his first year at the helm. He was also awarded life membership of the Geelong Football Club following his 150th team appearance in the round sixteen win against the Western Bulldogs, and named in the end-of-season South Australian State of Origin team.|$|E
5|$|Marge {{dreams that}} she and Homer are Adam and Eve. They peacefully live in the Garden of Eden until a snake (Snake Jailbird) tempts Adam into eating dozens of apples from the {{forbidden}} tree. He persuades Eve to try one when God (Ned Flanders) witnesses his sin. Even though Adam ate many apples, God only caught Eve eating an apple, and she is therefore <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Garden of Eden. Adam is unwilling to come clean, but misses Eve and thinks {{of a way of}} getting her back in by digging a tunnel with the help of some of the animals. God's unicorn, named Gary, becomes exhausted from the digging and dies just before God catches Adam trying to smuggle Eve back into the Garden. The death of the unicorn enrages him further, and he expels them both from the Garden of Eden.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifespan}} of the Columbian mammoth {{is thought}} to have been about 80 years. The lifespan of a mammal is related to its size; Columbian mammoths are larger than modern elephants, which have a lifespan of about 60 years. The age of a mammoth can be roughly determined by counting the growth rings of its tusks when viewed in cross section. However, ring-counting does not account for a mammoth's early years; early growth is represented in tusk tips, which are usually worn away. In the remainder of the tusk each major line represents a year, with weekly and daily lines found in between. Dark bands correspond to summer, making it possible to determine the season in which a mammoth died. Tusk growth slowed when foraging became more difficult, such as during illness or when a male mammoth was <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> herd (male elephants live with their herds until about the age of ten).|$|E

5|$|What {{followed}} Marcellinus's act of traditio, if it {{ever actually}} happened, is unclear. There {{appears to have been}} a break in the episcopal succession, however. Marcellinus seems to have died on October 25, 304, and (if he had apostatized) was probably expelled from the church in early 303, but his successor, Marcellus, was not consecrated until either November or December 306. In the meantime, two factions diverged in the Roman church, separating the lapsed, Christians who had complied with the edicts to ensure their own safety, and the rigorists, those who would brook no compromise with secular authority. These two groups clashed in street fights and riots, eventually leading to murders. It is said that Marcellus, a rigorist, purged all mention of Marcellinus from church records, and removed his name from the official list of bishops. Marcellus himself was <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city, and died in exile on January 16, 309.|$|E
5|$|Calvin's {{theology}} caused controversy. Pierre Caroli, a Protestant {{minister in}} Lausanne accused Calvin {{as well as}} Viret and Farel of Arianism in 1536. Calvin defended his beliefs on the Trinity in Confessio de Trinitate propter calumnias P. Caroli. In 1551 Jérôme-Hermès Bolsec, a physician in Geneva, attacked Calvin's doctrine of predestination and accused him of making God the author of sin. Bolsec was <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city, and after Calvin's death, he wrote a biography which severely maligned Calvin's character. In the following year, Joachim Westphal, a Gnesio-Lutheran pastor in Hamburg, condemned Calvin and Zwingli as heretics in denying the eucharistic doctrine of the union of Christ's body with the elements. Calvin's Defensio sanae et orthodoxae doctrinae de sacramentis (A Defence of the Sober and Orthodox Doctrine of the Sacrament) was his response in 1555. In 1556 , a Dutch dissident, held a public disputation with Calvin {{during his visit to}} Frankfurt, in which Velsius defended free will against Calvin's doctrine of predestination. Following the execution of Servetus, a close associate of Calvin, Sebastian Castellio, broke with him {{on the issue of the}} treatment of heretics. In Castellio's Treatise on Heretics (1554), he argued for a focus on Christ's moral teachings in place of the vanity of theology, and he afterward developed a theory of tolerance based on biblical principles.|$|E
5|$|The Binding Blade {{is set on}} the {{continent}} of Elibe, a setting shared with its prequel Fire Emblem. Elibe was engulfed a thousand years before in a conflict between humanity and dragons called the Scouring: begun by humanity, the dragons were defeated and <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> world. Victory was achieved using the eight Divine Weapons, which were subsequently scattered across Elibe. The story begins when King Zephiel, ruler {{of the kingdom of}} Bern, finishes the brutal conquest of Ilia and Sacae and sets his sights on Lycia. In a small region called Pherae, Roy, the son of Pherae's ruling marquess Eliwood, is forced to return home when Bern begins its invasion. As Eliwood is unable to battle due to illness, Roy is assigned command of Lycia's army. Roy leads his forces to Ostia, another region of Lycia ruled by Eliwood's friend Hector and his daughter Lilina. He is unable to save Hector from death, but rescues Lilina from Bern's occupation and sees to the protection of Guinivere, Zephiel's sister who opposes his war and has fled Bern with its royal treasure the Fire Emblem. They also discover a small cave on the outskirts of Ostia where they obtain a Divine Weapon. Over the course of the journey, Roy and the Lycian Army locate the other Divine Weapons.|$|E

5|$|While William Dyer {{appeared}} in the Boston records on several occasions, Mary Dyer had not {{caught the attention of}} the Massachusetts authorities until March 1638 as the Antinomian Controversy came to an end. Following Hutchinson's civil trial, she was kept as a prisoner in the home of a brother of one of the colony's ministers. Though she had been <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> colony, this did not mean she was removed {{as a member of the}} Boston church. In March 1638 she was forced to face a church trial to get at the root of her heresies, and determine if her relationship with the Puritan church would continue. While William Dyer was likely with other men finding a new home away from Massachusetts, Mary Dyer was still in Boston and in attendance at this church trial. At the conclusion of the trial, Hutchinson was excommunicated, and as she was leaving the Boston Church, Mary stood and walked hand in hand with her out of the building. As the two women were leaving the church, a member of the congregation asked another person about the identity of the woman leaving the church with Hutchinson. A reply was made that it was the woman who had had the monstrous birth. Governor Winthrop soon became aware of this verbal exchange and began conducting an investigation.|$|E
5|$|The late 17th {{century in}} England {{was a time}} of great {{progress}} in design. Following the austere years of Commonwealth rule, a great flourishing and development in both architecture and the arts began after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Royalist exiles and wealthy young men who made the Grand Tour, returned home with new ideas—often extravagant variations on classical themes. This was, for England, the dawn of the Baroque era. The new wave of architects such as Roger Pratt, John Webb, and Sir Christopher Wren were not just building vast edifices in Renaissance-inspired styles, but also transforming existing older houses. Representative of the utilisation of older houses is Coleshill House in Berkshire, where Pratt transformed the medieval, but now redundant, great hall into a classically inspired entrance hall complete with an imperial staircase. Great Halls were considered redundant now that employers wished to live separately from their servants, and no longer ate with them in a Great Hall. All evidence and odours of cooking and staff were <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> principal parts of the house. Employers began to live in fine airy rooms, above the ground floor, with privacy from their servants, who were now confined, unless required, to specifically delegated areas—often the ground and uppermost attic floors. This was a period of great social change in British history, and the educated prided themselves on enlightenment and elegance. While Belton is not in the Baroque style, it displays all the traits typical of the new tendencies.|$|E
5|$|The series {{revolves}} around the lives of Jaypaw, Lionpaw and Hollypaw, kits of Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight and grandchildren of the ThunderClan leader Firestar. The three slowly {{come to terms with}} their unique paths in life; Lionpaw worries about his thirst for blood on the battlefield, Hollypaw considers {{what it means to be}} truly loyal to her Clan, and Jaypaw is bitter that he was born blind. One day, Jaypaw unintentionally discovers a prophecy that he believes refers to him and his siblings. The three attempt to understand their new destinies, and realize that Lionpaw has the power to never be harmed in battle, whilst Jaypaw can walk in the dreams and read the minds of other cats. Hollypaw, on the other hand, struggles to determine what her unique power is. Hollypaw and Lionpaw are made warriors, becoming Hollyleaf and Lionblaze respectively, whilst Jaypaw becomes a medicine cat and is later given the name Jayfeather. They seek the advice of a mysterious loner named Sol, who promises to give them the answers to their destinies; however, they eventually realize him to be a deceptive liar, and he is <b>banished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> forest. Although uncertain of their powers, the three cats are always secure in the knowledge that they are deeply loved by their parents. This safe haven is shattered when they are forced into a fire by Ashfur, another ThunderClan warrior. Ashfur wishes to murder the three cats in order to punish their mother, Squirrelflight, for rejecting his love years earlier. However, Squirrelflight admits that the three cats are not her offspring, and Ashfur lets them go. The siblings are deeply distressed by this confession, and attempt to discover who their true parents are. They eventually learn that their mother is Leafpool, the ThunderClan medicine cat, and their father is Crowfeather, a WindClan warrior. Hollyleaf is devastated by this, and murders Ashfur in revenge. Unsatisfied, she then publicly announces to the rest of the Clans the true story of her heritage. When the Clans do not praise her for her honesty, but rather react with shock and confusion, Hollyleaf runs away into a series of collapsing tunnels. Presuming her to be dead, and numb with grief for their sister, Lionblaze and Jayfeather realize that Hollyleaf never had a power in the first place. They instead turn their eyes to two kits newly born in the Clan, one of whom could fulfill the third role in the prophecy.|$|E
