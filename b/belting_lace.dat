40|$|The {{individual}} {{passes through}} a variety of development periods on life line continuing from his childhood until his old age, and within these periods he shows some physiological and psychological characteristics which are different from each others. When consumption process starting with the birth of the individual is examined, it is seen that his needs are different in infancy, childhood, adolescence and old age. Consumer behaviours are affected by many demographical, economic, social, psychological and conditional factors and these factors form the frame of consumer behaviours. Since human is a being who continuously changes and develops, these factors changes according to people and in time. Consumer specialities and behaviours in childhood are quite important for knowing behaviours in the next years, building lifestyle and forming permanent ideas. Social development as a consumer in children and adolescents forms through taking buying decisions and preferring known brands. Children’s physical differences such as age, gender and body specialities, the families’ incomes, education levels and business statuses affect choice roles and perceptions of their children in clothes buying. Friendship groups in which children take place are important factors affecting clothing preferences. The child can form his clothing style in consequence of socialization and interaction. For children, their friends are so important. They significantly give importance to what their friends think about them. They form groups having the same opinions and likes between themselves. Each child wants to take place in a certain group. Clothes are effective as tools of communication and forming self in terms of being approved and attending to activities in friendship groups of the same age. By taking life line into account, life of the individual can be separated into the development periods as childhood, adolescence/youth, adulthood and old age. Childhood period examined in the scope of the research is the concrete operation period being one of the development periods of Piaget (7 - 11 years) and the period of incompetence against being successful that is one of psycho-social development periods of Eriksson (6 - 12 years). In the period of 7 - 11 years, since children {{spend most of their time}} in school and have high physical mobility, their clothes should have easy use and be functional. The aim of this study is to examine the factors managing clothes choices of students in primary education period according to the school variable. In the research, students’ consumer behaviours were examined in terms of gender properties, people and elements affecting shopping, shopping time and brand and colours. This study aims to determine the role of families, peers and school especially in clothes shopping of children. The material of the research composes of the data got by the help of the survey from primary education first step students who are between 7 - 11 years and study in private and public schools within the boundaries of the city of Ankara and of the relevant sources. In the research since it was aimed to determine clothes buying decisions of 7 - 11 years old children, descriptive survey method was used. The subject of this research is 7 - 11 years old children consumers studying in private and public schools within the boundaries of the city of Ankara; and the sample of it is 110 female and 110 male students who are randomly selected from private and public schools in Ankara and who study in private and public schools. The prepared survey was applied to the total 220 students as 55 female 55 male in public schools and 55 female 55 male in private schools. In addition, in the survey application, 22 students from each class taking place in primary education, both in private and public schools, were taken into the scope of the research. By the aim of collecting the data necessary for the research, the survey, in which questions tending to know 7 - 11 years old children and to determine factors affecting their clothes buying decisions were available, was developed. The survey consists of 20 questions. The findings were given in the cross tables by taking the school variable into account. In addition, χ² relation analysis was used to measure statistical relation between 7 - 11 years old primary education period students’ school and gender variables and clothing preferences and the properties they cared in clothes buying variables. Hypotheses for the relation test were structured in the following way. Ho= There isn’t statistical relation between the sample’s school type and variables related to clothes preferences and the properties they cared in clothes buying. H 1 = There is a statistical relation between the sample’s school type and variables related to clothes preferences and the properties they cared in clothes buying. For acceptance or denial of the hypothesis, the probability value is accepted as H 1 if (P) α= 0. 05. In consequence of the research, it is seen that 7 - 11 years old private and public school students go shopping with their families, that in children of primary education period the people with whom shopping is performed don’t show any difference and that the family has a significant effect on clothes buying for both groups. People with whom children go shopping vary according to gender. It was determined that male children made shopping more with the father and elder brother when compared to female ones. In the end of the research it was seen that the family and environmental factors became effective in children’s clothing preferences that supported the researches made before. Factors affecting children’s clothes buying behaviours are in the same direction both in public and private schools as advice of parents, friends and seeing in the store. The family being the first social groups of the children directs preferences during shopping. In the children taking place in a different social group with the start of school term, after the family element, friends and environmental stimulations affect shopping preferences. In the research, the effect of the family was seen more since that term was before the adolescence age of 7 - 11 years old children. Because the effect of the family loses its effect inversely proportional to increasing age. As the age of the child grows, the effect of the family decreases and the effect of peers and environment increases. When looked at colours preferred in clothes, it was seen that the students studying both in public and private school preferred the blue colour at the most. Close distributions occurred in colours of green, red, pink, lilac, orange, black and dark blue. It is considered that the reason of that was sourced from differences in the colour preferences of female children. While colours of blue, pink, lilac became dominant in girls, colours of blue, black and dark blue became dominant in boys. In the parallelism with studies made before, it was seen again that the gender became effective on colours. In the research the results relating reactions the children exhibited when they saw the dress on the body of another person revealed that 7 - 11 years old students studying both in public and private schools were not affected by this situation. In consequence of the research, it was determined that the covering tool the children most easily used in clothes was the zip in both school types. When looked in terms of gender, it was seen that girls preferred buttons but boys preferred rubber. It was determined that in dressing and undressing the children needed help in buttoning in both school types and that buttoning was followed by <b>belting</b> and <b>lacing</b> choices. When evaluated in terms of gender, it was seen that girls were in difficulty in zipping and boys were in difficulty in belting. According to the research results, 7 - 11 years old students in public and private schools preferred LCW at the most and later Nike brand. This study examined consumer behaviours in clothes buying of primary education students studying in public and private schools. It is recommended a comprehensive research to determine if factors affecting clothes buying behaviours continue also in adulthood term be made in the next researche...|$|R
