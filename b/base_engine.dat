5|$|The <b>base</b> <b>engine</b> was {{a version}} of the older Simca Type 180 2.0-litre with {{increased}} displacement, as also featured in the Matra Murena. It was unrelated to either the American Chrysler K or PSA Douvrin 2.2-litre engines. Available trim levels were designated GL and GLS. The GL was the only model to feature the four-speed manual transmission, and have power steering as an option as opposed to standard. It was first to be dropped, for the 1983 model year.|$|E
25|$|The <b>base</b> <b>engine</b> was {{unchanged}} for 1970, but the low-compression economy {{engine was}} deleted and the Ram Air III and Ram Air IV remained available, although {{the latter was}} now a special-order option.|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{magnesium}} silicate and alumina dispersed in engine lubricant on friction, wear, and tribosurface characteristics are studied under boundary and mixed lubrication conditions. Magnesium silicate and alumina, henceforth called as friction reducing compounds (FRC), were dispersed in engine lubricant in very low concentration of 0. 01 % weight/volume. Four-ball wear test rig {{was used to}} assess friction coefficient and wear scar diameter of balls lubricated with and without FRC <b>based</b> <b>engine</b> lubricant. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) was used to analyse the tribosurface properties and elemental distributions on worn surfaces of the balls. Test results revealed that FRC <b>based</b> <b>engine</b> lubricant increases friction coefficient but marginally reduces wear scar diameter of new balls, whereas, test on the worn-out balls running on FRC <b>based</b> <b>engine</b> lubricants shows 46 % reduction in friction coefficient compared to the new balls running on engine lubricants without FRC. Investigations on tribosurfaces with respect to morphology and elemental distribution showed the presence of Si and O elements in micropores of the worn surfaces of the balls, indicating role of FRC in friction coefficient reduction and antiwear properties. These FRC <b>based</b> <b>engine</b> lubricants may be used in the in-use engines...|$|R

25|$|The {{big-block}} 455 {{was gone}} forever. The <b>base</b> <b>engine</b> {{was now the}} Buick 350 with a 4-barrel carburetor until 1979. The Oldsmobile 403 was optional from 1977 to 1979. Oldsmobile's 350 diesel {{was added to the}} option list beginning in 1980, along with an Oldsmobile-sourced 307. The Buick 350 was now optional, with the <b>base</b> <b>engine</b> being the Buick 4.1 L V6 for improved fuel economy. In 1981, the then-optional Buick 350 was dropped. That same year, the Electra gained the new THM200-4R automatic transmission, which featured a lock-up torque converter and a 0.67:1 overdrive ratio. With the new transmission, the Electra could be equipped with a numerically higher rear axle ratio for better performance, while offering improved fuel economy with the overdrive range.|$|E
25|$|This {{engine was}} used in the 1970 AMX as the <b>base</b> <b>engine</b> and also in the 1970 Rebel, 1971-1978 Matador, Jeep J-series trucks 1970-1987, Wagoneer (SJ) models from 1972 to 1984, Cherokee (SJ) from 1974 to 1983, {{as well as in the}} {{full-sized}} Grand Wagoneer from 1984 to 1991 - becoming the last carbureted engine used in an American-built vehicle. The 360 V8 was also installed in the Bricklin SV-1 sports car for 1974 model year.|$|E
25|$|The '76 LeSabre was {{the only}} American {{full-size}} car with a standard V6 engine, which was Buick's brand-new 3.8-litre (231 CID) V6 engine. The V6 was only offered on the base-level LeSabre and not mentioned in initial 1976 Buick literature issued in September 1975 because the V6 engine was a last-minute addition to the line. The 350-cubic-inch V8 was the <b>base</b> <b>engine</b> on the LeSabre Custom and the 455-cubic-inch V8 was optional. Both V8s were optional on the base LeSabre.|$|E

25|$|The Federal Clean Air Act caused Ford {{to install}} {{catalytic}} converters for 1975 to help meet new emission standards. The converter significantly reduced the power {{output of the}} engines due to increased exhaust back pressure. In response, Ford changed the <b>base</b> <b>engine</b> on all Torinos to the 351-2V engine; along with this change, the Cruise-O-Matic transmission became standard. No manual transmissions were available. Power for all engines, except the 460, was significantly reduced compared to 1974, and with the weight increase, fuel economy and performance continued to decrease. The 400-2V and the 460-4V were the only engine options, as the 351-4V was no longer available.|$|E

2500|$|Engine {{selections}} {{consisted of}} only V8s. 1966 transmissions included a three-speed steering-column mounted manual with the <b>base</b> <b>engine,</b> a console mounted four-speed manual, or three-speed automatic.
