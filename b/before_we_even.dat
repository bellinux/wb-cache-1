That's not just a metaphor. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>even</b> fade in we have two cars smashing into each other. What a way to return: an accident in which one driver is nowhere to be found and the other flees into a nearby apartment, smooches his face and then uses a strange device to rearrange his appearance. That's my good old Fringe." [...] The Futon Critic rated [...] "A New Day in the Old Town" [...] the sixteenth best television episode of 2010, while website blogger io9 listed it as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{tried to}} work quickly and spontaneously, {{avoiding}} procrastination and over-analysis. Yorke was forced to write lyrics differently, as {{he did not have}} time to rewrite them in the studio; for some songs, he returned to the method of cutting up words and arranging them randomly he had employed for Kid A and Amnesiac. Greenwood said: [...] "We didn't really have time to be stressed about what we did. We got {{to the end of the}} second week <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>even</b> heard what we did on the first two days, and didn't even remember recording it or who was playing things. Which is a magical way of doing things." [...] The approach protected against the tension of previous sessions; O'Brien told Rolling Stone that Hail to the Thief was the first Radiohead album [...] "where, at the end of making it, we haven't wanted to kill each other." ...|$|E

500|$|... "You Got Me" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} on August 26 with a live acoustic version of [...] "Sad Savior" [...] as the B-side. The group went on a US fall tour in October and November with support from The Maine and Bad Rabbits. On November 7, a music video {{was released}} for [...] "You Got Me". The video begins with the band wondering about Reyes whereabouts, before shifting to Reyes dancing on an empty stage. The idea for it was proposed by the group's tour manager. Cooper said: [...] "Back <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>even</b> started touring, we’d go out to clubs on Long Island together and Eddie [...] would be tearing up the dance floor ... {{is by far the}} best dancer of the band." [...] On March 21, 2012, a music video was released for [...] "This Is All Now". Directed by Greg Hunter and Josh Romero of Dionysian Entertainment, they had shot the footage during the previous summer and created a music video with it. The group was so impressed they selected it as an official video. In April, the band toured Australia with New Found Glory and This Time Next Year. Between June and August, they were one of the headliners of the 2012 edition of Warped Tour.|$|E

I think that was a year <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>even</b> started thinking about recording this record".

K-Ci would later draw comparisons to Michael Jackson during his gospel career. [...] Separately, Mr. Dalvin and DeVante Swing performed and toured in their own family's gospel group, where the duos later made acquaintances through relationships the members were in at the time. In a 2011 interview, Dalvin stated, [...] "there was this girl gospel group called UNITY and then the Don DeGrate Delegation, which Devante and I played in. So we met {{some of the girls}} from UNITY and [...] was dating K-Ci <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>even</b> met [...] would always tell us that we need to meet K-Ci and JoJo."

I kind of have an idea though, and it's very rough right now. So I'm very eager to start that." [...] Sean Garrett spoke on the album's sound saying it was [...] "a great mish-mash of genres". Rihanna revealed during an interview with GQ's [...] "Men of the Year" [...] that she wanted her music to be uplifting saying [...] "I want to make music that’s hopeful, uplifting.

2500|$|Regarding the {{decision}} to do an episode about Anne Frank, Murphy said, [...] "We have a great writing staff but I will take credit for that. One of the things we've done on the show is we take historical figures – {{last year was the}} Black Dahlia and this year is Anne Frank. The Black Dahlia particularly was a case that was never solved so we solved that case in our way. The Anne Frank thing was always interesting to me because after the war, much like the Anastasia case, there were many women who came forward after that diary and said, 'Well I'm the real Anne Frank,' and they were struck down. Many of them were found to be mentally ill and suffering from schizophrenia, so I read about those cases. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>even</b> wrote one word of it, I thought there was sort of only one actress I was interested in playing Anne Frank and that was Franka. So I brought her in and said, 'I'm gonna write this for you and would you do it.' And we had no script because we were very early on in the season. She loved the story and I sorta swore her to secrecy and God bless her heart she had like five months without telling anybody. I love how it came together." ...|$|E

Three of the stories, obviously derived from some common source, state that five loaves and two fishes sufficed to feed five thousand persons, and that twelve baskets of fragments remained over. In the two others, also obviously derived from a common source, distinct from the preceding, seven loaves and a few small fishes are distributed to four thousand persons, and seven baskets of fragments are left.|$|E

60|$|It {{is proper}} I should add {{in this place}} the very little I have {{subsequently}} angled out upon the doings of that night. It {{took me a long}} while to gather it; for we dared not openly ask, and the free-traders regarded me with enmity, if not with scorn. It was near six months <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>even</b> knew for certain that the man survived; and it was years before I learned from one of Crail's men, turned publican on his ill-gotten gain, some particulars which smack to me of truth. It seems the traders found the Master struggled on one elbow, and now staring round him, and now gazing at the candle, or at his hand, which was all bloodied, like a man stupid. Upon their coming, he would seem to have found his mind, bade them carry him aboard, and hold their tongues; and on the captain asking how he had come in such a pickle, replied with a burst of passionate swearing, and incontinently fainted. They held some debate, but they were momently looking for a wind, they were highly paid to smuggle him to France, and did not care to delay. Besides which, he was well enough liked by these abominable wretches: they supposed him under capital sentence, knew not in what mischief he might have got his wound, and judged it a piece of good-nature to remove him {{out of the way of}} danger. So he was taken aboard, recovered on the passage over, and was set ashore a convalescent at the Havre de Grace. What is truly notable: he said not a word to any one of the duel, and not a trader knows to this day in what quarrel, or by the hand of what adversary, he fell. With any other man I should have set this down to natural decency; with him, to pride. He could not bear to avow, perhaps even to himself, that he had been vanquished by one whom he had so much insulted and whom he so cruelly despised.|$|E
