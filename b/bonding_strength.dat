25|$|Because of {{the small}} size of the B6 octahedra, they cannot interconnect. Instead, they bond to the B12 icosahedra in the {{neighboring}} layer, and this decreases <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> in the c-plane. Nitrogen atoms strengthen the bonding in the c-plane by bridging three icosahedra, like C atoms in the C-B-C chain. Figure 13 depicts the c-plane network revealing the alternate bridging of the boron icosahedra by N and C atoms. Decreasing the number of the B6 octahedra diminishes the role of nitrogen because the C-B-C chains start bridging the icosahedra. On the other hand, in MgB9N the B6 octahedron layer and the B12 icosahedron layer stack alternatively and there is no C-B-C chains; thus only N atoms bridge the B12 icosahedra. However, REB9N compounds have not been identified yet.|$|E
50|$|Atoms with {{non-bonding}} valence electrons, i.e., with lone pairs, {{have more}} flexibility in their <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> than those without lone pairs {{depending on whether the}} lone pairs are stereoactive or not. If the lone pairs are not stereoactive, they are spread uniformly around the valence shell, if they are stereoactive they are concentrated in one portion of the coordination sphere preventing that portion from forming bonds. This results in the atom having a smaller coordination number, hence a higher <b>bonding</b> <b>strength,</b> when the lone pair is stereoactive. Ions with lone pairs have a greater ability to adapt their <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> to match that of the counter-ion. The lone pairs become stereoactive when the <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> of the counter-ion exceeds twice the <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> of the ion when its lone pairs are inactive.|$|E
50|$|After the pre-bonding in air, in {{a special}} gaseous {{atmosphere}} or vacuum, the wafers have to pass an annealing process for increasing the <b>bonding</b> <b>strength.</b> The annealing therefore provides {{a certain amount of}} thermal energy which forces more silanol groups to react among each other and new, highly stable chemical bindings are formed. The kind of binding which forms directly depends on the amount of energy which has been delivered or the applied temperature respectively. In consequence the <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> rises with increasing annealing temperatures.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the push-out <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> of two surface treatments {{of a glass}} fiber and zirconia ceramic post. Materials and Methods: Sixty samples were fabricated and divided into two main groups according {{to the type of}} esthetic post indicated for maxillary central incisor: glass fiber post and zirconia ceramic post. Each group was subdivided to two subgroups according to the type of <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> test either between post and root or between post and core. Each subgroup was further subdivided into three classes according to surface treatment: no treatment (control), sandblasting in conjunction with silica particles then silane coating (SB+SIC+SC), etching using hydrofluoric acid then silane coating (E+SC). For the subgroups of the <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> between post and root, each class was subdivided into two subclasses according to the location of the sample (cervical or apical). Results: <b>Bond</b> <b>strength</b> to root canal or resin core were affected by the type of post, glass fiber post recorded significant higher <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> than zirconia ceramic. Surface treatment recorded higher values for <b>bond</b> <b>strength,</b> SB+SIC+SC gave higher <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> than E+SC. Cervical section recorded significant higher <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> than apical section. Conclusions: Glass fiber posts recorded higher <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> than glass ceramic post to both root canal and resin core. Surface treatments increase <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> for glass fiber and zirconia ceramic posts to both root canal and resin core.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of thermal cycling on the metal-ceramic <b>bond</b> <b>strength.</b> METHODS: Four different noble metal alloys were used. Specimens for the crack initiation test according to ISO 9693 were prepared to assess metal-ceramic <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> (n= 10). The metal substrates were either air-borne particle abraded or polished prior to veneering. <b>Bond</b> <b>strength</b> was measured after veneering or after 6000 thermal cycles. With one alloy in addition long-term thermal cycling with 15, 000 and 50, 000 cycles was carried out. Statistical analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Bonferroni test. RESULTS: Polished metal substrates showed a significantly lower <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> compared to the air-borne particle abraded substrates. Treatment with 6000 thermal cycles did not significantly reduce the <b>bond</b> <b>strength.</b> Long-term thermal cycling resulted in an exponential decrease of <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> for both polished and air-borne particle abraded specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Air-borne particle abrasion significantly increases metal-ceramic <b>bond</b> <b>strength.</b> Thermal cycling of metal-ceramic composites results in an exponential decrease of <b>bond</b> <b>strength.</b> The crack initiation test is a sensitive method for assessing the metal-ceramic <b>bond</b> <b>strength...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract – In this study, loss of concrete-steel <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> of {{lightweight}} and ordinary concrete under monotonic and cyclic loading is examined for plain and deformed steel bars. Here, {{lightweight and}} ordinary concrete-steel <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> {{is determined by}} pull-out test {{for a variety of}} specimens in various configurations. For each specimen, a bond strength-slip curve is obtained through monotonic loading. Following this process, an identical specimen is subjected to cyclic loading under similar conditions using the same test setup. These examinations reveal several insights. Lightweight concrete-steel <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> is greater than the ordinary concrete-steel <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> for plain steel bars under monotonic loading.

40|$|The <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> of resin cements to metal alloys {{depends on}} the type of the metal, {{conditioning}} methods and the adhesive resins used. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> of resin cements to base and noble metal alloys after sand blasting or application of silano-pen. Cylinders of light cured Z 250 composite were cemented to "Degubond 4 " (Au Pd) and "Verabond" (Ni Cr) alloys by either RelyX Unicem or Panavia F 2, after sandblasting or treating the alloys with Silano-Pen. The shear <b>bond</b> <b>strengths</b> were evaluated. Data were analyzed by three-way ANOVA and t tests at a significance level of P< 0. 05. When the alloys were treated by Silano-Pen, RelyX Unicem showed a higher <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> for Degubond 4 (P= 0. 021) and Verabond (P< 0. 001). No significant difference was observed in the <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> of Panavia F 2 to the alloys after either of surface treatments, Degubond 4 (P= 0. 291) and Verabond (P= 0. 899). Panavia F 2 showed a higher <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> to sandblasted Verabond compared to RelyX Unicem (P= 0. 003).

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} some issues {{pertaining}} to brick-mortar bond and masonry compressive strength.

In this investigation, the influence of <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> on masonry compressive strength has been examined through an experimental program using local bricks and mortars.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} study on flexural <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> of masonry using various blocks {{in combination with}} different mortars. Flexural <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> of masonry has been determined by testing stack-bonded prisms using a modified bond wrench test set-up. The effect of mortar composition and strength on the masonry's. flexural <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> using three types of masonry units (stabilized mud blocks, stabilized soil-sand blocks and burnt brick) has been examined. The effect of the masonry unit's moisture content on flexural <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> has also been studied. Increases in mortar strength lead to increased flexural <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> for cement mortar, irrespective {{of the type of}} masonry unit. It has been found that combination mortars, such as soil-cement mortar and cement-lime mortar, lead to better <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> compared to cement mortars.
