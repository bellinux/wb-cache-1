5|$|Hale {{had spent}} many {{hundreds}} of hours searching for comets without success, and was tracking known comets from his driveway in New Mexico when he chanced upon Hale–Bopp just after midnight. The comet had an apparent magnitude of 10.5 and lay near the globular cluster M70 in the constellation of Sagittarius. Hale first established {{that there was no}} other deep-sky object near M70, and then consulted a directory of known comets, finding that none were known to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area of the sky. Once he had established that the object was moving relative to the background stars, he emailed the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, the clearing house for astronomical discoveries.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June 2009, it was {{announced}} that the new album title would <b>be</b> <b>In</b> <b>This</b> Light and on This Evening and that they would be the first band to play at the new O2 Academy Birmingham. Through producer Flood's heavy usage of synthesisers, the album provided a synthpop/post-punk sound to Editors' production. Flood, who is famous for collaborating with electronic music influenced bands like U2, Depeche Mode, The Killers and Erasure, helped develop synthetic elements on the album, which resulted in a mixed reception from long-term fans as to the group's new direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{language}} spoken {{during this period}} {{is thought to be}} Southwestern Brythonic, but only one or two inscribed stones survive in Somerset from this period. However, a couple of curse tablets found in the baths at Bath may <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> language. Some place names in Somerset seem to be Celtic in origin and may be from this period or earlier, e.g. Tarnock. Some river names, such as Parrett, may be Celtic or pre-Celtic. The religion of the people of Somerset in this period is thought to be Christian but it was isolated from Rome until after the Council of Hertford in 673AD when Aldhelm was asked to write a letter to Geraint of Dumnonia and his bishops. Some church sites in Somerset are thought to date from this period, e.g., Llantokay Street.|$|E

25|$|Surgery was {{a common}} {{practice}} among physicians as treatment for physical injuries. The Egyptian physicians recognized three categories of injuries; treatable, contestable, and untreatable ailments. Treatable ailments the surgeons would quickly set to right. Contestable ailments were those where the victim could presumably survive without treatment, so patients assumed to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> category were observed and if they survived then surgical attempts {{could be made to}} fix the problem with them. They used knives, hooks, drills, forceps, pincers, scales, spoons, saws and a vase with burning incense.|$|E

Skiers in this class have a disability in one lower extremity, which may {{be a result of}} a leg amputation below the knee, knee arthrodesis or a hip arthrodesis. If there are functional problems on the leg, the strength of the leg will be 30 or less, where a fully functional leg normally has a strength of 40.
