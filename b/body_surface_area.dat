5|$|Due to this {{extremely}} thin membranous tissue, a bat's wing {{can significantly}} {{contribute to the}} organism's total gas exchange efficiency. Because of the high energy demand of flight, the bat's body meets those demands by exchanging gas through the patagium of the wing. When the bat has its wing in an open/spread out position it allows {{for an increase in}} surface area to volume ratio. The surface area of the wings is about 85% of the total <b>body</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area,</b> suggesting the possibility of a useful amount of gas exchange. The subcutaneous vessels in the membrane very close to the surface allow for the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how to classify the severity of psoriasis. Mild psoriasis {{has been defined as}} a percentage of <b>body</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> (BSA)≤10, a Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score ≤10, and a dermatology life quality index (DLQI) score ≤10. Moderate to severe psoriasis was defined by the same group as BSA >10 or PASI score >10 and a DLQI score >10. The DLQI is a 10 question tool used to measure the impact of several dermatologic diseases on daily functioning. The DLQI score ranges from 0 (minimal impairment) to 30 (maximal impairment) and is calculated with each answer being assigned 0–3 points with higher scores indicating greater social or occupational impairment.|$|E

To support them, the information model needs further extension to represent such individualized knowledge.|$|R
50|$|Allen’s rule is a {{biological}} rule {{that says the}} limbs of an endotherm is either shorter in cold climates or longer in hot climates.

25|$|Administration a 100mg/m² dose over {{a one-hour}} {{infusion}} gave a mean {{total body clearance}} of 21 L/h/m² and a mean steady state volume of distribution of 73.8 L/m² or 123 L based on the mean BSA (<b>body</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area)</b> of 1.68 m². Area under the plasma concentration-time curve had a mean value of 2.8mg.h/L. The Cmax of docetaxel {{was found to be}} 4.15 ± 1.35mg/L.

25|$|Dosage of {{chemotherapy}} can be difficult: If the dose is too low, {{it will be}} ineffective against the tumor, whereas, at excessive doses, the toxicity (side-effects) will be intolerable to the patient. The standard method of determining chemotherapy dosage is based on calculated <b>body</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> (BSA). The BSA is usually calculated with a mathematical formula or a nomogram, using a patient's weight and height, rather than by direct measurement of body mass. This formula was originally derived in a 1916 study and attempted to translate medicinal doses established with laboratory animals to equivalent doses for humans. The study only included 9 human subjects. When chemotherapy {{was introduced in the}} 1950s, the BSA formula was adopted as the official standard for chemotherapy dosing {{for lack of a better}} option.|$|E

5|$|There are no {{indications}} of the colour and skin {{texture of the}} animal because no skin impressions or mummies are known. Most life restorations show the creature's skin as thick, folded, grey, and hairless, based on modern rhinoceroses. Because hair retains body heat, modern large mammals such as elephants and rhinoceroses are largely hairless. American palaeontologist Donald Prothero has proposed that, contrary to most depictions, Paraceratherium had large, elephant-like ears that it used for thermoregulation. The ears of elephants enlarge the <b>body's</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> and are filled with blood vessels, making the dissipation of excess heat easier. According to Prothero, {{this would have been}} true for Paraceratherium; he points to robust bones around the ear openings.

25|$|The thermoregulatory model {{explaining}} {{the origin of}} bipedalism {{is one of the}} simplest theories so far advanced, but it is a viable explanation. Dr. Peter Wheeler, a professor of evolutionary biology, proposes that bipedalism raises the amount of <b>body</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> higher above the ground which results in a reduction in heat gain and helps heat dissipation. When a hominid is higher above the ground, the organism accesses more favorable wind speeds and temperatures. During heat seasons, greater wind flow results in a higher heat loss, which makes the organism more comfortable. Also, Wheeler explains that a vertical posture minimizes the direct exposure to the sun whereas quadrupedalism exposes more of the body to direct exposure. Analysis and interpretations of Ardipithecus reveal that this hypothesis needs modification to consider that the forest and woodland environmental preadaptation of early-stage hominid bipedalism preceded further refinement of bipedalism by the pressure of natural selection. This then allowed for the more efficient exploitation of the hotter conditions ecological niche, rather than the hotter conditions being hypothetically bipedalism's initial stimulus. A feedback mechanism from the advantages of bipedality in hot and open habitats would then in turn make a forest preadaptation solidify as a permanent state.|$|E
2500|$|Kt/V may {{disadvantage}} {{women and}} smaller patients {{in terms of}} the amount of dialysis received.

[...] Also, smaller people of either sex will have markedly lower levels of V, but only slightly lower levels of <b>body</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area.</b> [...] For this reason, any dialysis dosing system that is based on V may tend to underdose smaller patients and women. [...] Some investigators have proposed dosing based on surface area (S) instead of V, but clinicians usually measure the URR and then calculate Kt/V. [...] One can [...] "adjust" [...] the Kt/V, to calculate a [...] "surface-area-normalized" [...] or [...] "SAN"-Kt/V as well as a [...] "SAN"-standard Kt/V.
