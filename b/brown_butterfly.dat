They are {{generally}} quite plain in colour, white, pale green, bluish-green, or <b>brown.</b> <b>Butterfly</b> and moth eggs come in various shapes; some are spherical, others hemispherical, conical, cylindrical or lenticular (lens-shaped).

60|$|One {{day when}} {{out with his}} flock a sudden storm of rain caused him to seek for shelter in an old {{untrimmed}} hedge close by. He crept into the ditch, full of old dead leaves beneath the tangle of thorns and brambles, and setting {{his back against the}} bank he thrust his legs out, and as he did so was startled by an outburst of shrill little screams at his feet. Looking down he spied a shrew standing on the dead leaves close to his boot, screaming with all its might, its long thin snout pointed upwards and its mouth wide open; and just above it, two or three inches perhaps, hovered a small <b>brown</b> <b>butterfly.</b> There for a few moments it continued hovering while the shrew continued screaming; then the butterfly flitted away and the shrew disappeared among the dead leaves.|$|E

60|$|In 1831, when Tam {{was still}} eighteen, he {{enlisted in the}} Aberdeenshire militia, and during his brief period of service an amusing {{circumstance}} occurred which well displays the almost irresistible character of Edward's love of nature. While he was drilling with the awkward squad one morning, a butterfly of a kind {{that he had never}} seen before happened to flit in front of him as he stood in the ranks. It was a beautiful large <b>brown</b> <b>butterfly,</b> and Edward was so fascinated by its appearance that he entirely forgot, in a moment, where he was and what he was doing. Without a second's thought, he darted wildly out of the ranks, and rushed after the butterfly, cap in hand. It led him a pretty chase, over sandhills and shore, for five minutes. He was just on the point of catching it at last, when he suddenly felt a heavy hand laid upon his shoulder, and looking round, he saw the corporal of the company and several soldiers come to arrest him. Such a serious offence against military discipline might have cost him dear indeed, for corporals have little sympathy with butterfly hunting; but luckily for Edward, as he was crossing the parade ground under arrest, he happened to meet an officer walking with some ladies. The officer asked the nature of his offence, and when the ladies heard what it was they were so much interested in such a strange creature as a butterfly-loving militiaman, that they interceded for him, and finally begged him off his expected punishment. The story shows us what sort of stuff Edward was really made of. He felt so deep an interest in all the beautiful living creatures around him for their own sake, that he could hardly restrain his feelings even under the most untoward circumstances.|$|E
