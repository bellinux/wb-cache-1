5|$|The {{race was}} {{won by the}} Spanish rider Samuel Sánchez in 6hours, 23minutes, 49seconds, after a six-man <b>breakaway</b> <b>group</b> contested a sprint finish. Davide Rebellin of Italy and Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland, {{finishing}} second and third place with {{the same time as}} Sánchez, received silver and bronze medals respectively for the event. The hot and humid conditions were {{in sharp contrast to the}} heavy rain weathered in the women's road race the following day.|$|E
5|$|The 1988 race {{contained}} a rare spectacle where {{an early morning}} <b>breakaway</b> <b>group</b> held on until the finish: 27 kilometres into the race a group of unknown riders broke away and the pack did nothing to chase them down throughout the race. It was on a section of cobblestones outside Roubaix that Thomas Wegmuller (SUI) and Dirk Demol (BEL) {{broke away from the}} lead group to try for the victory. As if the success of the breakaway wasn't enough, Paris–Roubaix was about to deliver a cruel irony.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 {{the club}} moved {{to their first}} private {{enclosed}} ground at Dinton Road, next to Kingston Barracks, moving again {{at the turn of}} the century to Lower Marsh Lane in 1902, specifically to part of the rugby ground in Richmond Road. The split in 1908–09 between Kingston-on-Thames A.F.C. and Old Kingstonians led to the <b>breakaway</b> <b>group</b> Old Kingstonians playing at Norbiton Sports Ground, Kingston-on-Thames A.F.C. remaining at Richmond Road. Reunited after World War I, the club continued to play at Richmond Road but, in 1920, the site's owners, the Dysarts, leased the site to Leyland Motors, then establishing a factory base at nearby Ham. The club managed to negotiate a ground-sharing arrangement and were eventually able to buy the land, but the issue impacted their performance.|$|E

5|$|The race's sixth {{stage was}} the first stage {{containing}} several climbs of great difficulty. As the stage progressed, the general classification contenders formed a group on the road. Chiappucci and Marco Giovannetti attacked a few times, with all of their attempts being marked by the other riders. The contenders all crossed the finish line together seconds after stage winner Franco Vona, with Frenchman Laurent Fignon being {{the only one to}} lose time. The following day, sprinter Guido Bontempi and Giuseppe Petito formed a <b>breakaway</b> <b>group</b> that survived to the stage's conclusion, with Bontempi taking the stage victory. Stages 8 and 9 both came down to field sprints won by Mario Cipollini and Bontempi, respectively.|$|E
5|$|As the Giro left Austria, {{the race}} began {{to enter the}} Dolomites during stage fourteen. The {{eventual}} stage winner Marco Pantani was in a chasing group on the final climb of the stage, the Passo di Monte Giovo. He attacked, bridged the gap to the leading group, and left them behind to claim his first professional victory of his career. The next stage saw Pantani win again after he rode away from the attack group on the last climb of the Valico di Santa Cristina and he then soloed to the finish in Stradella. Pantani's efforts on the day moved him up to second overall in the race. The race's sixteenth stage took {{a break from the}} mountains with the stage being primarily fled, which ultimately led to the sprint finish that was won by Italian Maximilian Sciandri. Ján Svorada won the next day's stage after attacking from the <b>breakaway</b> <b>group</b> in the closing seconds.|$|E
5|$|On 21 October 1999, Warnock {{announced}} her departure {{at the next}} election for personal reasons, and threw her support behind former Town of Vincent mayor John Hyde, {{a member of the}} Centre faction of the Labor Party who had the support of the Left faction and some Centre members of Parliament. However, the key Centre unions had backed former ministerial adviser Adele Farina for the post, and Labor's affirmative action policy for candidates in winnable seats meant that failing to pick a female candidate would risk sitting male MPs. A week later, the Centre faction openly split, with a <b>breakaway</b> <b>group</b> endorsing Hyde. On 5 November, Farina withdrew from the contest, leaving Hyde to be preselected unopposed ahead of the 2001 election. He maintained the seat for Labor at the election, becoming the first openly gay man to sit in the Western Australian parliament.|$|E

50|$|In the 1990s, {{the main}} loyalist paramilitaries called ceasefires. Following this, small <b>breakaway</b> <b>groups</b> {{continued}} to wage violent campaigns {{for a number}} of years, and members of loyalist groups have continued to engage in sporadic violence.|$|R
50|$|After the Woodruff Manifesto, {{some members}} {{broke away from}} the {{mainstream}} church to form what eventually became the FLDS Church, the most popular group of fundamentalist Mormonism. The FLDS Church encourages polygamy, as do some other <b>breakaway</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
5|$|The sixteenth leg of {{the race}} {{included}} five categorized climbs before concluding in the municipality of Canazei. On the descent of the Pordoi Pass, van der Velde broke away and caught up to the leader on the road before winning his second consecutive stage. Meanwhile, behind van der Velde, Visentini tried several times to attack Roche {{on the slopes of}} the Passo Fedaia; however, Roche marked all of his moves and the two raced to the finish in the same group. Stage 17, the race's final day in the Dolomites, was marred by poor weather. A <b>breakaway</b> <b>group</b> of three was given a significant gap as the main general classification contenders rode behind in a collective group. Atala Ofmega's Italian rider Marco Vitali out-sprinted his two fellow breakaway members to win his first Grand Tour stage win.|$|E
5|$|The event's tenth stage {{featured}} a summit finish to Monte Terminillo. The general classification contenders {{were all in}} a group together {{as they reached the}} final climb of the day. Piotr Ugrumov {{was the first of the}} group to attack and was joined by Roberto Conti shortly after. Behind, Indurain led a chase group that contained Andrew Hampsten, Chiappucci, Giovannetti, and Luis Herrera, while general classification hopefuls Chioccioli and Fignon dropped off the back since they could not keep pace. The group caught Conti, who was alone after Ugrumov slowed, and from there, Herrera attacked to win the stage. The next day's route was an undulating one. Chioccioli, Roberto Pagnin, and Marco Lietti formed a <b>breakaway</b> <b>group</b> and gained an advantage of three and a half minutes over the main field which was led by Indurain's team, Banesto. The group remained in front, Pagnin took the stage victory, and Indurain finished over two minutes later. With around nine kilometers remaining in the twelfth stage, there was an accident that saw Chiappicci and Giovannetti amongst others go down. The peloton continued on, gearing up for a sprint finish that Leoni won.|$|E
5|$|The sixteenth saw {{no major}} {{shifts in the}} general {{classification}}. The top five riders in the general classification formed a leading group on the final climb {{but there were no}} major moves to create time gaps. Lelli took the stage win after ahead of Bugno. The following day was the last in the Dolomites and saw the ascension of five major climbs, including the Cima Coppi Passo Pordoi. On the second climbing of Pordoi, Chioccioli attacked and rode {{to the top of the}} climb to win the stage by thirty-eight seconds. Lejaretta crashed on the day and lost over six and a half minutes, putting him out of contention for the podium and overall victory. Midway through the stage, Fignon abandoned the race. The eighteenth day of racing was a transition stage. Several attempts were made to form a <b>breakaway</b> <b>group</b> before a group of eight were successful in creating a gap. The group was caught with five hundred meters to go by the chasing peloton which was setting up for a field sprint. Silvio Martinello managed to outsprint the likes of Cipollini and Abdoujaparov to win the day.|$|E

25|$|An {{exception}} to the rule of nonviolence occurred when Badshah Khan's son Ghani Khan on 26/27 April 1947 founded the <b>breakaway</b> <b>group</b> Zalmai Pukhtoon (Pashtun Youth), a militant, organisation of Pukhtoon youth, carrying fire-arms, the aim of which was to protect the Khudai Khidmatgars (Servants of God) and members of the Congress Party from violence feared at the hands of Muslim League activists. It had no connection as such with the Khudai Khidmatgars.|$|E

25|$|However, the Institute's {{intentions}} were paternal and no democratic control by its students was intended. In 1829, radical Rowland Detrosier led a <b>breakaway</b> <b>group</b> {{to form the}} New Mechanics' Institution in Poole Street, a move that had a serious effect on the recruitment and finances of the original institute. Subscriptions and memberships in 1830–31 were an all-time low and only the gradual opening of the board up to election by the members rectified the situation. Detrosier's break-away ultimately rejoined the Institute.|$|E
25|$|Several {{thousand}} people {{upset by the}} Cypriot government's failure {{to dispose of the}} explosives held a demonstration in the capital Nicosia on 12 July. A group of about fifty broke away from the demonstration and stormed the grounds of the Presidential Palace, demanding the resignation of Dimitris Christofias, President of Cyprus. The <b>breakaway</b> <b>group</b> was almost immediately apprehended by the Cyprus Police, who nonetheless used tear gas ten minutes after the incident had begun in an attempt to disperse the crowds. The protests continued into 13 July and 20 people were arrested during the disorder.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous stage, many fewer riders were interested in joining an early <b>breakaway</b> <b>group</b> as the stage featured over 60 kilometers of climbing. 17.5 kilometres into the stage, at the first sprint, there were still no riders who had escaped and so Robbie McEwen saw the possibility of going for it. He succeeded, but mainly because the other sprinters did not even challenge him; this means that they have probably given up for the points classification. It seems now that McEwen just needs {{to make it to}} Paris to win that green jersey.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>breakaway</b> <b>groups</b> {{opposed to}} the ceasefire ("dissident Irish republicans") {{continued}} a low-level armed campaign against the British security forces in Northern Ireland (see Dissident Irish Republican campaign).

25|$|As {{a result}} of African impatience with the pace of reforms and then in {{opposition}} to increased repression new black political parties had formed. They agitated both politically and violently sometimes resorting to sporadic acts of sabotage. At the forefront of this move was the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU), mostly Ndebele, led by Joshua Nkomo. It was shortly joined by the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly Shona, a <b>breakaway</b> <b>group</b> under Ndabaningi Sithole. After {{the collapse of the}} federation in 1963, both ZAPU and ZANU were banned and the majority of their leaders imprisoned.|$|E
25|$|Chalmers' ideas {{shaped the}} <b>breakaway</b> <b>group.</b> He {{stressed}} a social vision that revived and preserved Scotland's communal traditions {{at a time}} of strain on the social fabric of the country. Chalmers's idealised small equalitarian, kirk-based, self-contained communities that recognised the individuality of their members and the need for co-operation. That vision also affected the mainstream Presbyterian churches, and by the 1870s it had been assimilated by the established Church of Scotland. Chalmers's ideals demonstrated that the church was concerned with the problems of urban society, and they represented a real attempt to overcome the social fragmentation that took place in industrial towns and cities.|$|E
