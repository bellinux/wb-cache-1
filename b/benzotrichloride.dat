40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the monocarboxylic acids of the benzene series. The {{preparation}} of Benzoic acids from arenes, toluenes, aryl halides, and arynes is discussed. Optimum conditions for the oxidation of alkylarenes to benzoic acids, avoiding decarboxylation, have been determined. Monoalkylbenzenes are oxidized to benzoic acids by oxygen {{in the presence of}} a cobalt/manganese catalyst. The oxidation of toluenes (especially nitrotoluenes) with potassium permanganate at 95 ºC in nitrobenzene/water under phase-transfer conditions gives good yields of benzoic acids. Another well established approach involves the photochlorination of toluenes, to give <b>benzotrichlorides,</b> followed by hydrolysis. Benzyne can be generated from either bromobenzene, or chlorobenzene, by treatment with sodamide. The aryne is then reacted in situ with O-silyl enolates of carboxylic esters to form bicyclic adducts. These adducts, after hydrolysis, yield 2 -alkylbenzoic acids. An improved methodology for the oxidative decarboxylation of toluic acids to cresols using copper salts and cupric oxide has been discussed...|$|R

50|$|The {{first to}} {{investigate}} trifluoromethyl groups {{in relationship to}} biological activity was F. Lehmann in 1927. An early review appeared in 1958. An early synthetic method was developed by Frédéric Swarts in 1892, based on antimony fluoride. In this reaction <b>benzotrichloride</b> was reacted with SbF3 to form PhCF2Cl andPhCF3. In the 1930s Kinetic Chemicals and IG Farben replaced SbF3 with HF.The McLoughlin-Thrower reaction (1968) is an early coupling reaction using iodofluoroalkanes, iodoaromatic compounds and copper. In 1969 Kobayashi & Kumadaki adapted their protocol for trifluoromethylations.|$|E
5000|$|The photochlorination of the {{side-chain}} of toluene generates its mono- to trichlorinated products, {{the most}} important of which is the mono-substituted benzyl chloride. It is converted via hydrolysis into benzyl alcohol, which is used as an intermediate for the production of plasticizers. Benzyl chloride can also be converted via benzyl cyanide with subsequent hydrolysis into phenylacetic acid. The disubstituted benzal chloride is used as a raw material for the production of benzaldehyde. As a pure substance, benzaldehyde is used to impart almond smell to foods. Furthermore, benzaldehyde is used as an intermediate for the production of malachite green and other dyes.

40|$|The decay technique, {{currently}} {{applied to}} the study of ionic processes in gaseous and liquid systems, requires multitritiated precursors to generate labeled daughter ions. The preparation of three such precursors, namely C 6 3 H x H 6 −x, C 6 3 H x H 5 −x CH 3, and C 6 H 5 C 3 H 3 −x is described. The ring–labeled precursors were obtained from the cyclization of C 2 3 H 2, and respectively of a C 2 3 H 2 /propyne mixture, carried out at 25 °C over a K 2 CrO 4 –promoted silica–alumina catalyst.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} reduction of alpha,alpha,alpha-trichlorotoluene (<b>benzotrichloride)</b> {{and of the}} corresponding isomeric pyridine derivatives has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry and microcoulometry. Three irreversible diffusion controlled reduction waves have been observed in the voltammetry of the trichloromethyl derivatives and are found to correspond to the progressive two-electron reduction of derivatives where a chlorine atom is substituted by a hydrogen atom. The peak potentials E-p show that reduction of the pyridine derivatives is easier {{than that of the}} benzene derivatives with the same number of chlorine atoms, the more positive shift occurring for the 4 -substituted compounds. The experimental findings would indicate a concerted electron transfer-bond breaking (C-Cl) mechanism for all the compounds examined, {{as well as for the}} chloromethyl and dichloromethyl derivatives formed after Cl/H substitution. Electron uptake appears to be the rate-determining step of the reductive cleavage of these molecules.

40|$|Two recent {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} an x-chlorine substituent increases S(_N) 1 reactivity, but analysis of the trends in E(_A) and (_Δ) S* values in each case, shows that serious discrepancies exist between them. In view of this it was considered {{that the role of}} an x-chlorine substituent was still uncertain and it was decided to look into the matter further. Towards this end, the solvolyses of benzyl chloride, benzal chloride, <b>benzotrichloride,</b> diphenylmethyl chloride and diphenylmethylene chloride have been examined in various solvents, over as wide a range of temperatures as possible, consistent with accurate results, it being considered that the mechanism of solvolysis was S(_N) 1 in all cases, {{with the possible exception of}} benzyl chloride. Analysis of the E(_A) and ΔS* values for the solvolyses of these compounds shows, in the first place, that the sol volysis of benzyl chloride is not straight forward S(_N) 1. Its mechanism of solvolysis is discussed in chapter VII where it is concluded that it proceeds by a single, predominantly S(_N) 2 mechanism. Further analysis of the E(_A) and ΔS* values (and in some cases AC*(_p) values) of the other compounds, in chapter VI, indicates that the primary role of an x-chlorine substituent in S(_N) 1 reactions is electron release, although, as a second order effect it appears to cause an increase in the extent of solvation of the transition state. The disturbing effects in the hydrolysis of diphenyl methylene chloride in aqueous acetone are analysed in part II where it is shown that they can be quantitatively explained, over a wide range of experimental conditions, on the basis of the mass law and ionic strength effects, proposed by Hughes and Ingold, in S(_N) 1 reactions. The exceptionally large mass law effect for diphenyl methylene chloride is ascribed to powerful electron release by the x-chlorine atom, so confirming the conclusions reached in part I...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} the effect of electrolytes on the rates of reaction of p-methoxybenzyl chloride and benzbydryl chloride in 70 % acetone, where both compounds hydrolyse entirely by mechanism S(_N) 1. The work was designed to test the possibility that better nucleophilic reagents than water could react with p-mothoxybenzyl chloride by the concurrent operation of mechanisms S(_N) 1 and S(_N) 2. Since electrolytes had been previously demonstrated to have specific effects on the rates of ionlsation of organic compounds(^ 29, 86, 87,) it was also necessary to measure their effect on an Ionization process before the quantitative treatment of the first problem was possible. Benzhydryl chloride, which is not susceptible to bimolecular attack(^ 61 b), was chosen for this purpose because its rate of ionisation was known to have the same sensitivity as that of p-methosybenzyl chloride to changes in the solvent composition and to additions of sodium perchlorate(^ 29). The studies have shorn that the specific effects of electrolytes on the rate of reaction of benzhydryl chloride in the present solvent are consistent with the operation of two effects 1) a non-specific acceleration of the rate of reaction duo to ion-atmosphere stabilisation of the transition state for ionisation(^ 80), ii) a specific change in the “effective” solvent composition due to solvent of the electrolytes(^ 87). The effect is greater for p-methoxybenzyl chloride than for benzhydryl chloride by a constant small amount. The application of these principles to the effects of electrolytes on the rate of reaction of p-methoxybenzyl chloride, has confirmed that azlde ions and chloride ions react with this compound by the simultaneous operation of the S(_N) 1 and S(_N) 2 processes. This is probably also the case for the substitutions by bromide, nitrate and fluoride ions. The non-electrolyte, pyridine, has also been shown to react with p-methoxybenzyl chloride by concurrent operation of the two S(_N) mechanisms, but no allowance for the medium effect could be made in tills case, because other inert non-electrolytes were found to affect the rates of ionisation of beazhydryl chloride and p-methoxybenzyl chloride in different ways. Additional evidence is provided for the validity of the criterion(^ 61) of mechanism on which it was concluded(^ 29) that p-methoxybenzyl chloride hydrolyses by mechanism S(_N) 1 70 % aqueous acetone. This mechanistic criterion requires that the value of the ratio ΔC*/∆S* should be independent {{of the nature of the}} substrate for S(_N) 1 reactions. The value of this ratio for the hydrolysis of p-nitrobenzhydryl chloride in 50 % aqueous acetone is shown to be the same as the corresponding values for the structurally different compounds tert-butyl chloride, benzylidene chloride, p-methylbenzylidene chloride and <b>benzotrichloride</b> in the same solvent(^ 62), where the reactions all follow the S(_N) 1 path...|$|E
