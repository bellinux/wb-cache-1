50|$|The {{increase}} in pressure produced by a single stage {{is limited by the}} relative velocity between the rotor and the fluid, and the turning and diffusion capabilities of the airfoils. A typical stage in a commercial compressor will produce a pressure increase of between 15% and 60% (pressure ratios of 1.15-1.6) at design conditions with a polytropic efficiency in the region of 90-95%. To achieve different pressure ratios, axial compressors are designed with different numbers of stages and rotational speeds. As a rule of thumb we can assume that each stage in a given compressor has the same temperature rise (Delta T). Therefore, at the entry, temperature (Tstage) to each stage must increase progressively through the compressor and the ratio (Delta T)/(Tstage) entry must decrease, thus implying a progressive reduction in stage pressure ratio through the unit. Hence the rear stage develops a significantly lower pressure ratio than the first stage.Higher stage pressure ratios are also possible if the relative velocity between fluid and rotors is supersonic, but this is achieved at the expense of efficiency and operability. Such compressors, with stage pressure ratios of over 2, are only used where minimizing the compressor size, weight or complexity is critical, such as in military jets.The airfoil profiles are optimized and matched for specific velocities and turning. Although compressors can be run at other conditions with different flows, speeds, or pressure ratios, this can result in an efficiency penalty or even a partial or complete breakdown in flow (known as compressor stall and pressure surge respectively). Thus, a practical limit on the number of stages, and the overall pressure ratio, comes from the interaction of the different stages when required to work away from the design conditions.

This is achieved normally through the use of adjustable stators or with valves that can <b>bleed</b> <b>fluid</b> from the main flow between stages (inter-stage bleed).Modern jet engines use a series of compressors, running at different speeds; to supply air at around 40:1 pressure ratio for combustion with sufficient flexibility for all flight conditions.|$|E

40|$|The {{indications}} for {{and type}} {{and amount of}} fluid resuscitation for trauma patients in the field remains highly controversial. There is unanimity, however, that trauma victims may suffer from acute blood loss. In addition to stopping the <b>bleeding</b> <b>fluid</b> resuscitation is the second mainstay in shock therapy. The insertion of 1 or 2 large-bore i. v. lines is indicated for manifest or threatening shock. Patients without signs of bleeding or hemorrhagic shock do not require fluid replacement therapy. Blood losses from bleeding that has ceased or has been stopped by compression or self-tamponade should be substituted. In uncontrolled bleeding from intraabdominal, pelvic or other internal sources immediate transport to a trauma center is required. In such situations many experts favour a goal-oriented approach of permissive hypotension aiming at a systolic blood pressure of 70 - 90 mmHg. In patients with severe traumatic brain injury a goal-oriented fluid resuscitation (mean arterial blood pressure of 90 mmHg) is presently recommended. Additional doses of catecholamines may be needed. Crystalloids are the recommended choice of fluid.

40|$|BACKGROUND: As women {{present at}} earlier gestations to early {{pregnancy}} units (EPUs), {{the number of}} women diagnosed with a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) increases. Some of these women will have an ectopic pregnancy (EP), and it is this group in the PUL population that poses the greatest concern. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop Bayesian networks to predict EPs in the PUL population. METHODS: Data were gathered in a single EPU from all women with a PUL. This data set was divided into a model-building (599 women with 44 EPs) and a validation (257 women with 22 EPs) data set and consisted of the following variables: vaginal <b>bleeding,</b> <b>fluid</b> in the pouch of Douglas, midline echo, lower abdominal pain, age, endometrial thickness, gestation days, the ratio of HCG at 48 and 0 h, progesterone levels (0 and 48 h) and the clinical outcome of the PUL. We developed Bayesian networks with expert information using this data set to predict EPs. RESULTS: The best Bayesian network used the gestational age, HCG ratio and the progesterone level at 48 h and had an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0. 88 for predicting EPs when tested prospectively. CONCLUSIONS: Discrete-valued Bayesian networks are more complex to build than, for example, logistic regression. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that such models can be used to predict EPs in a PUL population. Prospective interventional multicentre studies are needed to validate the use of such models in clinical practice. status: publishe...|$|R

Homologous blood was given according to unit protocols. ResultsThe groups were well matched with respect to demographic and comorbid characteristics.

Hypokalemia {{is one of the}} most commonly encountered electrolyte abnormalities causing hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis. Case presentation We present the case of a 62 -year-old Caucasian man with decompensated liver cirrhosis having multiple episodes of hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by vomiting. He had an incisional hernia at the right lumbar region. A barium contrast study of the small intestine and magnetic resonance imaging showed that the hernial sac included gastric antrum and bowel. We observed that hepatic encephalopathy coincided with hypokalemia as a result of a large volume of vomiting triggered by the collapsed hernial sac. Hepatic encephalopathy was resolved by administration of intravenous potassium. Conclusion This case illustrates that a hernia causing a large volume of vomiting may be a precipitant factor in the development of hepatic encephalopathy. </p...|$|R

Nonetheless, there might be some potential advantages of SLED in general. First, SLED might lead to more rapid mobilization of patients and perhaps lead to shorter ICU stays and more rapid convalescence. Second, short and flexible duration of therapy might to some extent decrease the complications of RRT such as <b>bleeding,</b> hypotension, <b>fluid</b> overload as seen in other therapies like IHD.

30|$|Haemorrhagic shock {{treatment}} requires immediate and appropriate resuscitation to preserve tissue perfusion {{while waiting for}} <b>bleeding</b> control. <b>Fluid</b> administration remains {{the cornerstone of the}} initial resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock. However, whereas fluid resuscitation is effective to restore arterial blood pressure, it may induce dilution of coagulation factors that subsequently increases blood loss [1]. Moreover, an uncontrolled increase in arterial pressure during resuscitation might split clots and induce re-bleeding [2, 3]. To avoid the potential adverse effects of fluid resuscitation, recent European guidelines on trauma haemorrhage have recommended the use of a restricted volume replacement strategy to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of 80 – 90  mmHg [4]. Nevertheless, targeting a tight objective of arterial pressure during the resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock is challenging for caregivers since it requires continuous attention and several interventions {{in a short period of}} time during which they have many tasks to perform concomitantly. This is even more challenging in isolated areas without specialized caregivers in case of prolonged field care or massive casualties.|$|R
