5|$|Based on {{morphological}} similarities, Jack Garrick in 1982 grouped {{this species}} with the bignose shark (C. altimus) and the sandbar shark (C. plumbeus), while Leonard Compagno in 1988 placed {{it as the}} sister species of the grey reef shark (C. amblyrhynchos). A phylogenetic analysis based on allozyme data, published by Gavin Naylor in 1992, indicated that the Caribbean reef shark is the sister taxon to a clade formed by the Galapagos shark (C. galapagensis), dusky shark (C. obscurus), oceanic whitetip shark (C. longimanus), and the <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> (Prionace glauca). However, more work is required to fully resolve the interrelationships within Carcharhinus.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Gavin Naylor's 1992 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{allozyme}} sequence data, {{found that the}} silky shark {{is part of a}} group containing large sharks with a ridge between the dorsal fins. One branch within this group contains the sandbar shark (C.plumbeus) and the bignose shark (C.altimus), while the silky shark is the basal member of the other branch and the sister taxon to a clade containing the Caribbean reef shark (C.perezi), Galapagos shark (C.galapagensis), oceanic whitetip shark (C.longimanus), dusky shark (C.obscurus), and <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> (Prionace glauca). Mine Dosay-Abkulut's 2008 ribosomal DNA analysis, which included the silky, blue, and bignose sharks, confirmed the closeness of those three species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>sharks,</b> {{like most}} pelagic sharks, tend to fare poorly in captivity. Attempts at keeping them using {{circular}} tanks with long glide paths, and pools with 3 m central depth gently ascending to zero depth {{have met with}} mixed results at best; most specimens last fewer than 30 days. As with other pelagic sharks, {{they seem to have}} trouble avoiding walls or other obstacles. In 1969, at Sea World San Diego, several <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> were put in circular tanks (15 m diameter, 2.1 m deep) for three months. The <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> did fairly well until bull sharks were added to the tank; the bull <b>sharks</b> ate the <b>blue</b> <b>sharks.</b> The captivity record for <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> as of 2008 was held by the New Jersey Aquarium for a specimen that lasted roughly seven months before expiring of an apparent bacterial infection.|$|R

5|$|The {{tiger shark}} {{is a member}} of the order Carcharhiniformes, the most species-rich order of sharks, with more than 270 species also {{including}} the small catsharks and hammerhead sharks. Members of this order are characterized by the presence of a nictitating membrane over the eyes, two dorsal fins, an anal fin, and five gill slits. It is the largest member of the Carcharhinidae family, commonly referred to as requiem sharks. This family consists of mostly slender but powerful mid- to large-sized sharks and includes some other well-known sharks, such as the <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> (Prionace glauca), lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris), and bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas).|$|E
5|$|Although {{observations}} of living goblin sharks are scant, its anatomy suggests its lifestyle is inactive and sluggish. Its skeleton is reduced and poorly calcified, the muscle blocks along its sides (myomeres) are weakly developed, and its fins {{are soft and}} small. Its long caudal fin, held at a low angle, is also typical of a slow-swimming shark. The long snout {{appears to have a}} sensory function, as it bears numerous ampullae of Lorenzini that can detect the weak electric fields produced by other animals. Due to the snout's softness, it is unlikely to be used for stirring up prey from the bottom as has been proposed. Vision seems to be less important than other senses, considering the relatively small optic tectum in the shark's brain. Yet unlike most deep-sea sharks, it can change the size of its pupils, thus probably does use its sight in some situations. Goblin sharks may fall prey to the <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> (Prionace glauca). Parasites documented from this species include the copepod Echthrogaleus mitsukurinae, and the tapeworms Litobothrium amsichensis and Marsupiobothrium gobelinus.|$|E
5|$|Prized for its {{meat and}} fins, the {{porbeagle}} {{has long been}} under heavy fishing pressure. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, and ranks among the most valuable of any shark: in 1997 and 1998 it had a wholesale price of EUR 5–7/kg, four {{times that of the}} <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> (Prionace glauca). Most of the demand comes from Europe, though the United States and Japan also import this species. The fins are shipped to East Asia for use in shark fin soup. The remainder of the shark may also be utilized, for production of leather, liver oil, and fishmeal. International trade in the porbeagle appears to be significant, but remains unquantified as shark products tend not to be reported to the species level, and many consist of a mix of various species. This shark is caught most readily on longlines, but is also susceptible to gillnets, driftnets, trawls, and handlines. It is valuable enough to be generally retained when caught as bycatch; if storage space cannot be spared it may be finned and the carcass discarded.|$|E
40|$|Stomachs from 222 <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> {{collected}} {{along the}} Brazilian coast were analyzed - 116 from the northeastern region and 106 {{from the southern}} region. A total of 51 prey taxa were identified. The most important prey items in the southern region were Mysticeti whales, teleosteans, the gempylid Ruvettus pretiosus and the nomeid Arioma bondi. Cephalopods were more diverse, with dominance of vertical migrants Histioteuthis spp., Cranchiidae and the epipelagic octopus Ocythoe tuberculata. In the northeastern region, <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> consumed mainly teleosteans, including the alepisaurid Alepisaurus ferox and the gempylid Gempylus serpens. Among cephalopods, Histioteuthis spp. and the epipelagic octopus Tremoctopus violaceus were the dominant items. Predation upon schooling prey was occasional, as observed on Arioma bondi. Birds also were consumed in both regions; Puffinus gravis was the fifth most frequent item in the northeastern region. During the reproductive migration cycle, <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> likely prey in the thermocline, which is deeper in the northeastern region {{and closer to the}} surface in the southern region...|$|R

5|$|Large {{numbers of}} silky sharks are caught by {{commercial}} and artisanal multispecies shark fisheries operating off Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, the United States, Ecuador, Spain, Portugal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Yemen, and Côte d'Ivoire. Even greater numbers are caught incidentally by tuna longline and purse seine fisheries throughout its range, particularly those using fish aggregating devices. It {{is the most}} common shark caught as bycatch in the eastern Pacific and Gulf of Mexico tuna fisheries, and the second-most common shark caught as bycatch (next to the <b>blue</b> <b>shark)</b> overall. The fins are valued as an ingredient in shark fin soup, with captured sharks often finned at sea {{and the rest of the}} body discarded. Fins from an estimated one-half to one and a half million silky sharks are traded globally per year; it is the second- or third-most common species auctioned on the Hong Kong fin market, which represents over half the global trade. The meat (sold fresh or dried and salted), skin, and liver oil may also be used, as well as the jaws: this species is the predominant source of dried shark jaw curios sold to tourists in the tropics. Some sport fishers catch silky sharks.|$|E

500|$|Countershading is {{observed}} {{in a wide range}} of animal groups, both terrestrial, such as deer, and marine, such as sharks. It is the basis of camouflage in both predators and prey. It is used alongside other forms of camouflage including colour matching and disruptive coloration.

500|$|Garrick (1982) {{placed the}} Galapagos shark and the dusky shark {{at the center}} of the [...] "obscurus group", one of two major groupings within Carcharhinus.

Based on allozyme data, Naylor (1992) reaffirmed the integrity of this group, with the additions of the silky shark (C. falciformis) and the <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> (Prionace glauca). The closest relatives of the Galapagos shark were found to be the dusky, oceanic whitetip, and blue sharks.|$|E

500|$|In 1982, Jack Garrick {{published}} a phylogenetic analysis of Carcharhinus based on morphology, {{in which he}} placed the dusky shark and the Galapagos shark (C. galapagensis) {{at the center of}} the [...] "obscurus group". The group consisted of large, triangular-toothed sharks with a ridge between the dorsal fins, and also included the bignose shark (C. altimus), the Caribbean reef shark (C. perezi), the sandbar shark (C. plumbeus), and the oceanic whitetip shark. This interpretation was largely upheld by Leonard Compagno in his 1988 phenetic study, and by Gavin Naylor in his 1992 allozyme sequence study.

Quint's methods anger Hooper, especially when he disembowels a <b>blue</b> <b>shark,</b> and then uses an illegally fished unborn dolphin for bait. All the while, Quint taunts Hooper as a rich college boy. Brody and Hooper also argue, as Brody's suspicions about Hooper's possible affair with Ellen grow stronger; at one point, Brody unsuccessfully attempts to strangle Hooper.|$|E
500|$|The {{biology of}} the longfin mako is little-known; it is {{somewhat}} common in the western Atlantic and possibly the central Pacific, while in the eastern Atlantic, it is rare and outnumbered over 1000-fold by the shortfin mako in fishery landings. The longfin mako's slender body and long, broad pectoral fins evoke the oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) and the <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> (Prionace glauca), both slow-cruising sharks of upper oceanic waters. This morphological similarity suggests that the longfin mako is less active than the shortfin mako, {{one of the fastest}} and most energetic sharks. Like the other members of its family, this species possesses blood vessel countercurrent exchange systems called the rete mirabilia (Latin for [...] "wonderful net", singular rete mirabile) in its trunk musculature and around its eyes and brain. This system enables other mackerel sharks to conserve metabolic heat and maintain a higher body temperature than their environments, though whether the longfin mako is capable of the same is uncertain.|$|E

40|$|The Atlantic Ocean {{is subject}} {{to high levels of}} {{longline}} fishing with <b>blue</b> <b>sharks,</b> Prionace glauca, being the most commonly caught species. Despite high levels of fishing pressures, the spatial dynamics and behaviour of <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> are poorly understood. Recording the individual movement patterns of fish using electronic tags is however becoming a central method for understanding how individual animals respond behaviourally to changes in environment and what habitat preferences may exist. Hence, the robust identification of how large marine predators use the ocean is essential for management and conservation. Near real-time satellite linked tags were fitted to 12 <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> in the North Atlantic Ocean between 2006 and 2011. A total of 14, 543 km of tracking data was obtained over a combined period of 476 days. Using novel remote sensing techniques to detect oceanic features objectively, shark movements were compared with the locations of thermal fronts. Front-affiliated swimming movements were observed for several sharks, but the use of bathymetric clues may also be important in determining movement patterns. Frequent seasonal fronts associated with southern Portugal coincide strongly with the space use of juvenile sharks and may be influential regarding nursery ground habitat preferences. In addition to a whole array of potential clues, movement patterns are directed by finer scale thermal gradients that are not detectable using the current model. Despite the apparent complex relationships between blue shark-movements and environment, areas with distinct bathymetric and frontal signatures could be regions in which to concentrate conservation efforts...|$|R
