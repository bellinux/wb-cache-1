5|$|Anti-slavery campaigners, {{inspired}} by Non-conformist preachers such as John Wesley, started {{some of the}} earliest campaigns against the practice. Prominent local opponents of both the trade and the institution of slavery itself included Anne Yearsley, Hannah More, Harry Gandey, Mary Carpenter, Robert Southey, William Wordsworth and Samuel Coleridge. The campaign itself proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> movements for reform and women's emancipation.|$|E
5|$|Elagabalus {{declared}} {{the date of}} the victory at Antioch to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> his reign and assumed the imperial titles without prior senatorial approval. This violated tradition but was a common practice among 3rd-century emperors nonetheless. Letters of reconciliation were dispatched to Rome extending amnesty to the Senate and recognizing the laws, while also condemning the administration of Macrinus and his son.|$|E

5|$|The {{damage from}} Rosita made a large {{impact on the}} tourist industry. The time of impact {{happened}} just before the Easter and ANZAC Day Holiday period. Easter is considered to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the tourist season, so it is usually expected {{that there will be}} an increase of visitors into Broome at this time. Many visitors delayed or cancelled their trips, and some cut short their holiday. Car hire companies that had been booked out for the holiday period had people returning vehicles early.|$|E
5|$|The {{resignation}} of Ponce Vaides {{and the creation}} of the junta has been considered by scholars to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the Guatemalan Revolution. However, the revolutionary junta did not immediately threaten the interests of the landed elite. Two days after Ponce Vaides' resignation, a violent protest erupted at Patzicía, a small Indian hamlet. The junta responded with swift brutality, silencing the protest. The dead civilians included women and children.|$|E

5|$|After an {{overtime}} loss to Carolina, the Colts won all {{but three}} of their remaining games, finishing 12–4. On November 30, the Colts hosted the 9–2 New England Patriots in what would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the NFL's top rivalry of the 2000s. The Colts trailed 31–10 late {{in the third quarter}} before Manning threw three touchdown passes in a span of six minutes to tie the game. Trailing 38–34 in the final minutes, the Colts had three plays at the 1-yard line to try and score the winning touchdown. Running back Edgerrin James was stopped on fourth down by linebacker Willie McGinest and the Patriots won. In a Week 14 win against Atlanta, Manning threw for five touchdowns and was named player of the week a second time. He also earned AFC Offensive Player of the Month honors for the month of October.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{numerous}} issues {{in dealing with}} the expanding crisis. A defensive battle had been proven unsound by the immense amount of time and resources expended pursuing a similar course during the twelve year Malayan Emergency that had ended only a few years before, as well as Dutch efforts to quell the Indonesian rebels during the Indonesian War of Independence, but launching an offensive into Indonesian territory to take the initiative would bring the conflict into an all-out war, and this was unacceptable to Cabinet policy-makers. At the same time, an effective solution had to be found that did not cede Malaysia to the Communists, a move that many feared would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the 'domino effect' in Asia. The proposal selected as the most effective was presented to the Cabinet in January 1964 by Richard Austen Butler, who recommended that Britain continue fighting without declaring war, with the conflict contained in Borneo, a strategy designed to weary the Indonesians of battle until the necessity of economic reform overcame them and peace was made.|$|E
5|$|While {{national}} security concerns were {{cited as the}} grounds for rejection, politics {{played an important role}} as well. The project, and the export issue associated with it, was considered so important that French President Georges Pompidou appealed directly to U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1971 to approve the deal, and Henry Kissinger brought the issue up with President Pompidou in a 1972 meeting. GE reportedly argued at the highest levels that having half of the market was better than having none of it, which they believed would happen if SNECMA pursued the engine on their own without GE's contribution. Nixon administration officials feared that this project could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the end of American aerospace leadership.|$|E
