There are abundant of theories that attempt to find various causes or triggers of stress while bringing emphasis on both stressors and respective coping strategies. There are also theories which explain stress in terms of body-mind complex, cognition, sociology and etc. One of the major factors which is affected by stress is perhaps health. Stress, when mismanaged leads to plethora of health problems. This descriptive study is an attempt to understand stress with respect to certain other factors like heavy drinking, perceived health and life satisfaction. The data used is secondary in nature, which was collected from Statistics Canada. Correlation and MANOVA were used in order to realize the objectives of the study. All the variables are strictly correlated with Karl Pearson correlation coefficient ranging from 0. 73 to 0. 99. In significant test all variables do not <b>belie</b> <b>with</b> alternative hypothesis, which means the association/relationship is not zero. In MANOVA, the null hypotheses were accepted as all p-values are more than significance level (0. 01). Apart from this, most interestingly the variables are behaving like cohorts whereby resulting cohort effect. * Assistant Professor, Faculty of Management, Symbiosis Centre for Distance Learning, Pune (Maharashtra...|$|E

His mistress, says the poet, is nothing like this conventional image, but is as lovely as any woman". Here, Barbara Mowat offers her opinion of the meaning behind Sonnet 130; this work breaks the mold to which Sonnets had come to conform. Shakespeare composed a sonnet which seems to parody a great many sonnets of the time. Poets like Thomas Watson, Michael Drayton, and Barnabe Barnes were all part of this sonnet craze and each wrote sonnets proclaiming love for an almost unimaginable figure; Patrick Crutwell posits that Sonnet 130 could actually be a satire of the Thomas Watson poem [...] "Passionate Century of Love", {{pointing out that the}} Watson poem contains {{all but one of the}} platitudes that Shakespeare is making fun of in Sonnet 130. However, E.G. Rogers points out the similarities between Watson's [...] "Passionate Century of Love," [...] Sonnet 130, and Richard Linche's Poem collection entitled [...] "Diella." [...] There is a great deal of similarity between sections of the Diella poem collection and Shakespeare's [...] "Sonnet 130", for example in [...] "130" [...] we see, [...] "If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head," [...] where in [...] "Diella" [...] we see [...] "Her hayre exceeds fold forced in the smallest wire." [...] Each work uses a comparison of hairs to wires; while in modern sense this may seem unflattering, one could argue that Linche's work draws upon the beauty of weaving gold and that Shakespeare mocks this with harsh comparison. This, along with other similarities in textual content, lead, as E.G. Rogers points out, the critic to believe that Diella may have been the source of inspiration for both homage, by Watson's [...] "Passionate Century of Love," [...] and satire by Shakespeare's [...] "Sonnet 130." [...] The idea of Satire is further enforced by final couplet of [...] "130" [...] in which the speaker delivers his most expositional line: [...] "And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare, as any she <b>belied</b> <b>with</b> false compare." [...] This line projects the message behind this work, demeaning the false comparisons made by many poets of the time.|$|R

40|$|Background National drug {{policies}} are often regarded as inconsequential, rhetorical documents, however this <b>belies</b> the subtlety <b>with</b> which such documents generate discourse and produce (and re-produce) policy issues over time. Critically analysing {{the ways in}} which policy language constructs and represents policy problems is important as these discursive constructions have implications for how we are invoked to think about (and justify) possible policy responses. Methods Taking the case of Australia's National Drug Strategies, this paper used an approach informed by critical discourse analysis theory and aspects of Bacchi's (2009) ¿What's the Problem Represented to be¿ framework to critically explore how drug policy problems are constructed and represented through the language of drug policy documents over time. Results Our analysis demonstrated shifts in the ways that drugs have been ¿problematised¿ in Australia's National Drug Strategies. Central to these evolving constructions was the increasing reliance on evidence as a way of ¿knowing the problem¿. Furthermore, by analysing the stated aims of the policies, this case demonstrates how constructing drug problems in terms of ¿drug-related harms¿ or alternately ¿drug use¿ can affect what is perceived to be an appropriate set of policy responses. The gradual shift to constructing drug use as the policy problem altered the concept of harm minimisation and influenced the development of the concepts of demand- and harm-reduction over time. Conclusions These findings have implications for how we understand policy development, and challenge us to critically consider how the construction and representation of drug problems serve to justify what are perceived to be acceptable responses to policy problems. These constructions are produced subtly, and become embedded slowly over decades of policy development. National drug policies should not merely be taken at face value; appreciation of the construction and representation of drug problems, and of how these ¿problematisations¿ are produced, is essential...|$|R

It challenges traditional accounts and recent critiques of this preoccupation, both of which associate modernism with heroic impulses to revolt, to experiment, or to occasion new aesthetic and/or political forms. Some critics praise the artist 2 ̆ 7 s ingenuity in such pursuits while others seek to demystify its dissimulative strategies (which ideologically <b>belie</b> contiguous relations <b>with</b> popular media or disavowed traditions). In response to these approaches, this project demonstrates that Virginia Woolf, D. H.

The new, for these thinkers, is not a quality of aesthetic, political, and/or philosophical efforts but, rather, a force that violently and unexpectedly inspires and evades such efforts. Their preoccupation with the new—or what I call “an otherwise”—has less to do, then, with formal innovation or aesthetic novelty and, instead, with the problem of how one might learn to reaffirm this incapacity as a potentially generative vulnerability, a vulnerability to ruptures and rearrangements that unforeseen surprises may introduce into habits of thinking (Deleuze), practices of reading (Woolf), erotic alliances or affections (Lawrence), and even relations to processes and problems of aging (Stevens). Their lives and oeuvres theorize that one might effortfully cultivate the ethos of a lookout—admixing self-varying attitudes of readiness, of risk, and of prudence—as a means to affirm this vulnerability. ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{forms of}} materialism, new and old, have lately offered highly visible avenues of {{critical}} and historical inquiry in modernist studies and in literary studies in general; there {{may now be}} as many materialisms as there are ideological ills in want of remedy. This dissertation takes as its point of departure a historical and intellectual discrepancy between the contemporary revival of materialism in the humanities and the prominent and typically explicit anti-materialism of modernist writers and artists, with {{particular attention to the}} fictions of Virginia Woolf and James Joyce. Modernist aesthetic and intellectual culture, I argue, can be seen as staging materiality as a crucial site for complex negotiations of modernity, technology, selfhood, and the artwork. I explore how this negotiation unfolds in the space, and occasionally at the limits, of the novel. In these terms, I explain how the vocal antimaterialism of Woolf <b>belies</b> her fascination <b>with</b> the narrative figuration of materiality. My argument shows that this figuration is typically invested not in objects, things, or materials available to everyday experience, but in a non-phenomenological core of material being that can only be imagined as a force of erasure, destruction, loss, and finitude. I suggest that for Woolf, and for Joyce in a much different way, it is only a "view from no one" of disembodied spectatorship or eyeless sight that might be adequate to materiality in this sense. In readings of Woolf's To the Lighthouse and Between the Acts, I show how this insight provokes a literary crisis embodied in the problem of materialism, which will appear to be the novel's death sentence and its hopes for renewal at the same time. My reading of the "Ithaca" episode of Joyce's Ulysses departs from standard interpretations of Joycean materiality. I suggest that the problem of materialism in Joyce lies at the crux of a conception of the literary artwork existing between total idealization (the figure of the encyclopedia) and the extinction to which ideality is finally exposed. I propose that the genuine Joycean figure of materiality may be located in this aesthetic oscillation between knowledge and its erasure. 2019 - 05 - 2...|$|R
