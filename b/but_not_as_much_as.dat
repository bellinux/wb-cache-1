5|$|Because the Earth's {{orbit around}} the Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's {{distance}} from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the Sun in the same way, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> does the Moon's varying distance from Earth. When Earth approaches its farthest distance from the Sun in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to the Sun in early January.|$|E
5|$|Neptune (30.1 AU), though {{slightly}} smaller than Uranus, is more massive (equivalent to 17 Earths) and hence more dense. It radiates more internal heat, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> Jupiter or Saturn. Neptune has 14 known satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active, with geysers of liquid nitrogen. Triton {{is the only}} large satellite with a retrograde orbit.

5|$|Babakotia radofilai and {{all other}} sloth lemurs share many traits with living sloths, demonstrating {{convergent}} evolution. It had long forearms, curved digits, and highly mobile hip and ankle joints. Its skull was more heavily built than that of indriids, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> in the larger sloth lemurs. Its dentition {{is similar to that}} of all other indriids and sloth lemurs. It lived in the northern part of Madagascar and shared its range with at least two other sloth lemur species, Palaeopropithecus ingens and Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion. Babakotia radofilai was primarily a leaf-eater (folivore), though it also ate fruit and hard seeds. It is known only from subfossil remains and may have died out shortly after the arrival of humans on the island, but not enough radiocarbon dating has been done with this species to know for certain.|$|E

25|$|Finally, even subtle nature {{manipulations}} {{can increase}} well-being or other indicators of well-being. For instance, simply having plants {{in a lab}} can increase intrinsic aspirations, decrease extrinsic aspirations, and encourage more generous decision making. These effects were also mediated by nature connectedness and autonomy. Also, virtual nature {{has been found to}} provide some psychological benefits (<b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> real nature).

25|$|However, {{the study}} of {{classics}} has not declined as fast elsewhere in Europe. In 2009, a review of Meeting the Challenge, a collection of conference papers about the teaching of Latin in Europe, noted that though there is opposition {{to the teaching of}} Latin in Italy, it is nonetheless still compulsory in most secondary schools. The same can be said in the case of France or Greece, too. Indeed, Ancient Greek is one of the compulsory subjects in Greek secondary education, whereas in France, Latin is one of the optional subjects that can be chosen in a majority of middle schools and high schools. Ancient Greek is also still being taught, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> Latin.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a stable}} {{population}} of woodland caribou throughout {{a large portion}} of the Gwich’in Settlement Area and are an important food source for Gwich’in although they harvest them less than other caribou. Gwich’in living in Inuvik, Aklavik, Fort McPherson, and Tsiigehtchic harvest woodland caribou <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> other caribou. The Gwich'in prefer to hunt Porcupine caribou or the barren-ground Blue Nose herd, who travel in large herds, when they are available. Many hunters claimed that woodland caribou that form very small groups, are wilder, both hard to see and hard to hunt. They are very smart, cunning and elusive. However, at times due to their natural curiosity, they may freeze, standing as if they were trying to hide unlike the Porcupine of Bluenose caribou that will outrun a hunter.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{scholarship}} has highlighted the deep seated problems {{emerging in the}} Spanish state and military from the 1630s onwards. The Count-Duke of Olivares, the key advisor to King Philip IV, had attempted to re-energise the Army of Flanders by injecting increasing numbers of the aristocracy into the senior ranks; the results had included rank inflation, a fragmented system of command and a raft of temporary appointments. By the 1650s, the officer-to-man ratio in the Army had reached the unsustainable levels of one to four. Recruitment had steadily shifted; by the mid-17th century, troops were increasingly being raised less by contractor and contractors, and more by either capturing men or selecting them as levies from cities and towns via lotteries (quintas or suertes). The infrastructure and support services were considerably improved, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> elsewhere, and Army was increasingly perceived as a 'broken force' in European affairs. With money continuing to be tight, visitors to the provinces {{in the second half}} of the century reported seeing the Army in an appalling state, with soldiers begging and short of food. Despite this, there was no return to the mass mutinies of the preceding century.|$|E

Brantley noted that the work was suitable for any audience: [...] "Even if you’ve never read a word of Chekhov, you’re likely to find plenty to make you laugh: Mr. Hyde Pierce’s skillfully low-key comic discomfort; Ms. Nielsen’s segues from manic eruption into glazed smiling stupor; Ms. Weaver’s game sendup of every self-loving, self-doubting movie queen there ever was." [...] He noted the play does not compare with some of Durang's most absurd work, calling it [...] "blander and thinner". Brantley said there was comfort in an evening of deliverance of Chekhov's [...] "lost souls", by Durang.|$|E
500|$|Rock music journalists often {{uses the}} {{reported}} conflicts between Wilson and Love {{as a way}} to highlight an aesthetic dichotomy in the band's repertoire. This engendered a split fanbase corresponding to two distinct musical markets. One group is the conservative audience who enjoys the band's early hits as a wholesome representation of American popular culture from before the political and social movements brought on in the mid 1960s. The other group also appreciates the early songs for their energy and complexity, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the band's ambitious work that was created during the formative psychedelic era. In 2017, Rolling Stone included the cousins' discord as one of [...] "Music's 30 Fiercest Feuds and Beefs".

500|$|Filming {{began in}} February 2011, and {{concluded}} {{in the late}} summer (from the Northern Hemisphere's perspective). Filming largely took place in South Africa, particularly in Cape Town, but also in Durban and Springbok, Northern Cape. Outside South Africa the series was also filmed in Budapest, Hungary, and the UK. Among the separate locations the series takes place in, the New Delhi hotel in the first two episodes were shot in Cape Town, and the suburbs of Hout Bay doubled as Mozambique. Throughout the shoot the actors were allowed to perform the majority of their own stunts. Military advisors were on hand to teach the actors how to perform certain stunts, and to tell them what they did wrong during the take. The series includes a number of sex scenes, many of which were performed by Stapleton. In an interview with the British newspaper Metro, the actor stated [...] "I've done my fair share of nude scenes in the past <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> this – not as risqué, anyway," [...] adding that while he got used to it, he was always [...] "a bit nervous running around in front of 50 people with no clothes on.

It's nerve-racking at first but you have as much fun as you can with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Various {{publications}} for manga, anime {{and other}} media have provided acclaim and criticism of Yahiko's character. While reviewing the volume 8 from the manga, Mania Entertainment writer Megan Lavey [...] applauded the way Yahiko starts acting much stronger after Kenshin's departure to Kyoto and noted that, {{along with the other}} characters starring in the volume, he is seen more in-depth. While reviewing volume 15, Lavey praised Yahiko's development during the series as he becomes a good fighter and his courage shows a remarkable potential to become a powerful swordsman. However, Carlos Ross from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews criticized Yahiko for being [...] "a bit annoying" [...] during the start of the series but noted that he has his enjoyable moments. His design in the OVA series has drawn acclaim {{as one of the few}} to be well translated from his original manga design by Mike Crandol from Anime News Network. In the second review from the OVA, Crandol liked that Yahiko appeared several times in contrast to the previous OVA in which he was [...] "written out" [...] so that the story would focus more in Kamiya Kaoru and Kenshin's relationship. He also noted his battle against Himura Kenji to be very entertaining, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the previous fight which was between Kenshin and Yukishiro Enishi. Ridwan Khan from Animefringe noted the fight between Yahiko and Kenji had been long awaited, it was mostly overshadowed by Kenshin and Kaoru's ending. In the Critical Survey of Graphic Novels: Manga, multiple writers acknowledged how both Yahiko and Sagara Sanosuke spend their time in the series searching for ways to become. However, they do it for a heroic reason which is assisting Kenshin.|$|E
