5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Boeing {{selected}} the CFM56-3 to exclusively power the Boeing 737-300 variant. The 737 wings were {{closer to the}} ground than previous applications for the CFM56, necessitating several modifications to the engine. The fan diameter was reduced, which reduced the <b>bypass</b> <b>ratio,</b> and the engine accessory gearbox was moved {{from the bottom of}} the engine (the 6o'clock position) to the 9o'clock position, giving the engine nacelle its distinctive flat-bottomed shape. The overall thrust was also reduced, from , mostly due to the reduction in <b>bypass</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} airplane, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 (registration N1819U), {{was delivered}} in 1973 {{and had been}} owned by UAL since then. Before departure on the flight from Denver on July 19, 1989, the airplane had been operated {{for a total of}} 43,401 hours and 16,997 cycles. The airplane was powered by General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) CF6-6D high <b>bypass</b> <b>ratio</b> turbofan engines.|$|E
5|$|The A-10 was envisioned to {{fly from}} forward air bases and semi-prepared runways with {{high risk of}} foreign object damage to the engines. The unusual {{location}} of the General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofan engines decreases ingestion risk, and allows the engines to run while the aircraft is serviced and rearmed by ground crews, reducing turn-around time. The wings are also mounted closer to the ground, simplifying servicing and rearming operations. The heavy engines require strong supports: four bolts connect the engine pylons to the airframe. The engines' high 6:1 <b>bypass</b> <b>ratio</b> contributes to a relatively small infrared signature, and their position directs exhaust over the tailplanes further shielding it from detection by infrared homing surface-to-air missiles. The engines and exhausts are angled upward by nine degrees to cancel out the nose-down pitching moment that would otherwise generate from being mounted above the aircraft's center of gravity and avoids the need to trim the control surfaces to prevent pitching.|$|E
50|$|The {{growth of}} <b>bypass</b> <b>ratios</b> during the 1960s gave jetliners fuel {{efficiency}} that could compete {{with that of}} piston-powered planes.Today (2015), most jet engines have some bypass. Modern engines in slower aircraft, such as airliners, have <b>bypass</b> <b>ratios</b> up to 12:1; in higher-speed aircraft, such as fighters, <b>bypass</b> <b>ratios</b> are much lower, around 1.5; and craft designed for speeds up to Mach 2 and somewhat above have <b>bypass</b> <b>ratios</b> below 0.5.|$|R
50|$|Combat {{aircraft}} use engines {{with low}} <b>bypass</b> <b>ratios</b> to compromise between fuel {{economy and the}} requirements of combat: high power-to-weight ratios, supersonic performance, {{and the ability to}} use afterburners.|$|R
50|$|Turboprops have <b>bypass</b> <b>ratios</b> of 50-100, {{although}} the propulsion airflow is less clearly defined for propellers than for fans and propeller airflow is {{slower than the}} airflow from turbofan nozzles.|$|R
25|$|A higher <b>bypass</b> <b>ratio</b> {{increases}} the thrust {{for the same}} engine power as a fundamental consequence of transferring power from a small diameter propelling jet to a larger diameter one. When the F-135 is in the hover using its increased <b>bypass</b> <b>ratio,</b> the thrust augmentation decreases to 50% with no increase in fuel flow. Thrust augmentation increases to 52% in horizontal flight when using the afterburner, but with a large increase in fuel flow.|$|E
25|$|For the CF6-80A/A1, the fan {{diameter}} {{remains at}} 86.4 in (2.19 m), with an airflow of 1435lb/s (651kg/s). Overall pressure ratio is 28.0, with a <b>bypass</b> <b>ratio</b> of 4.66. Static thrust is 48,000lbf (214kN). The basic mechanical configuration {{is the same}} as the -50 series.|$|E
25|$|For the CF6-80C2-A1, the fan {{diameter}} {{is increased}} to 93 in (2.36 m), with an airflow of 1750lb/s (790kg/s). Overall pressure ratio is 30.4, with a <b>bypass</b> <b>ratio</b> of 5.15. Static thrust is 59,000lb (263kN). An extra stage {{is added to}} the LP compressor, and a 5th to the LP turbine.|$|E
5|$|The LEAP is a {{new engine}} design based on and {{designed}} to replace the CFM56 series, with 16% efficiency savings by using more composite materials and achieving higher <b>bypass</b> <b>ratios</b> of over 10:1. LEAP has entered service in 2016.|$|R
40|$|The {{requirement}} {{to reduce the}} specific fuel consumption of future advanced transport aircraft, have resulted in dedicated activities in two fields of aeronautics. In the area of propulsion the current trend {{in the development of}} turbofan engines is directed towards higher <b>bypass</b> <b>ratios.</b> In the area of aerodynamics the objective is an extensive laminarization. Since with the higher <b>bypass</b> <b>ratios</b> of the advanced powerplants is associated a growth in the engine nacelle dimensions, not only the skin friction drag rises, but the problem of engine-airframe integration is also intensified due to negative engine-airframe interactions. The paperdeals with the Euler code validation by flight trials with reference to the static pressure distributions on a Natural Laminar Flow nacelle...|$|R
40|$|Radioactive tracer {{techniques}} {{were used for}} in-situ measurements of the solute velocity, longitudinal dispersion coefficient, and <b>bypassing</b> <b>ratio,</b> {{as well as for}} estimation of the impact of land-use change on area-averaged nitrate relative concentration profiles. It was found that the impact of land-use on nitrate relative concentration profiles can be studied for small and medium cumulative infiltration only. The mean and dominant velocities obtained from breakthrough curves were significantly higher than those obtained from concentration profiles, but a good agreement of maximal velocities was found. From the results of the <b>bypassing</b> <b>ratio</b> measurement {{it can be seen that}} the warm and rainless second half of April 1993 (similar situation repeated in April 2000) resulted in a preferential flow as high in the barley field as that in the untilled soil with well-developed macropore systems. The rain resulting in the macropore flow can appear 24 -times on average in south-western Slovakia during the vegetation season. Such rain, combined with the high value of the <b>bypassing</b> <b>ratio</b> can be a cause in the drop of fertilization efficiency, as well as in the shallow groundwater pollution in the Danubian Lowland...|$|R
25|$|This initial {{version of}} the CF6 has a {{single-stage}} fan with one core booster stage, driven by a 5-stage LP (low pressure) turbine, turbocharging a 16-stage HP (high pressure) axial compressor driven by a 2-stage HP turbine; the combustor is annular; separate exhaust nozzles are used for the fan and core airflows. The 86.4-in (2.19-m) diameter fan generates an airflow of 1,300lb/s (590kg/s), resulting in a relatively high <b>bypass</b> <b>ratio</b> of 5.72. The overall pressure ratio of the compression system is 24.3. At maximum take-off power, the engine develops a static thrust of 41,500lb (185.05kN).|$|E
25|$|The Air Force {{considered}} Boeing's {{design to}} be better than that of Lockheed, but Lockheed's proposal was the lowest total cost bid. Lockheed was selected the winner in September 1965, then awarded a contract in December 1965. General Electric's TF39 engine was selected in August 1965 to power the new transport plane. At the time GE's engine concept was revolutionary, as all engines beforehand had a <b>bypass</b> <b>ratio</b> of less than two-to-one, while the TF39 promised and would achieve a ratio of eight-to-one, which had the benefits of increased engine thrust and lower fuel consumption.|$|E
25|$|An indigenously {{produced}} turbofan engine, the IHI Corporation F7, {{was also}} developed {{to power the}} P-X. By April 2004, the JDA had completed a successful evaluation of five XF7 research engines, by which point it was viewed as being the sole candidate powerplant for the P-X program. In May 2005, the IHI Corporation received a contract for an additional seven XF-7 test engines from the JDA following the completion of initial tests in December 2004, four of these engines were to equip the first flight test aircraft. The Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC)-equipped F7 engine had a <b>bypass</b> <b>ratio</b> of 8:1, which was reported as being substantially higher than rivals such as the General Electric CF34-8E.|$|E

50|$|At the June 2017 Paris Air Show, Boeing's {{aircraft}} {{development manager}} Mike Delaney confirmed {{the use of}} composites for the whole airframe, a hybrid cross-section and <b>bypass</b> <b>ratios</b> above 10:1.If it is launched in early 2019, its design will be done in 2020, fabrication in 2021-22, build in 2023, flight tests and certification in 2024 and introduction in 2025.|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{presentation}} is to give some of {{the objectives of the}} testing program. This includes: develop jet noise data base for separate flow nozzles with <b>bypass</b> <b>ratio's</b> 5 to 14; evaluate effect of pylon on noise; develop low performance impact noise suppression concepts; and evaluate potential for active control of jet noise...|$|R
25|$|The BAe 146 {{is powered}} by four Avco Lycoming ALF 502 {{turbofan}} engines, which are fixed on pylons underneath the aircraft's high wing. The ALF 502 {{was derived from the}} Lycoming T55 turboshaft powerplant that powers the Chinook heavy transport helicopter. Notably, the ALF 502 had a very low level of operational noise, much lower than most other competing aircraft. This was achieved largely {{through the use of a}} geared turbofan engine; the gearbox allows the fan blade tip speed to stay below the speed of sound dramatically reducing the aircraft noise. Additionally other sound deadening measures include a high <b>bypass</b> <b>ratio</b> compared to contemporary aircraft and additional sound damping layers built into the engine.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} the -6 entered service, an {{increase}} in thrust and therefore core power was required. Unable to increase (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature, General Electric chose the expensive path of reconfiguring the CF6 core to increase its basic size. They removed two stages {{from the rear of}} the HP compressor, leaving an empty air passage where the blades and vanes had once been. Two booster stages were added to the LP (low pressure) compressor, which increased the overall pressure ratio to 29.3. Although the 86.4 in (2.19 m) diameter fan was retained, the airflow was raised to 1,450lb/s (660kg/s), yielding a static thrust of 51,000lbf (227kN). The increase in core size and overall pressure ratio raised the core flow, decreasing the <b>bypass</b> <b>ratio</b> to 4.26.|$|E
500|$|The only {{supersonic}} airliner {{in direct}} competition with Concorde was the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144, nicknamed [...] "Concordski" [...] by Western European journalists for its outward similarity to Concorde. It had been alleged that Soviet espionage efforts {{had resulted in}} the theft of Concorde blueprints, supposedly {{to assist in the}} design of the Tu-144. As a result of a rushed development programme, the first Tu-144 prototype was substantially different from the preproduction machines, but both were cruder than Concorde. The Tu-144S had a significantly shorter range than Concorde. Jean Rech, Sud Aviation, attributed this to two things, a very heavy powerplant with an intake twice as long as that on Concorde, and low-bypass turbofan engines with too-high a <b>bypass</b> <b>ratio</b> which needed afterburning for cruise. The aircraft had poor control at low speeds because of a simpler supersonic wing design; in addition the Tu-144 required braking parachutes to land while Concorde used anti-lock brakes. The Tu-144 had two crashes, one at the 1973 Paris Air Show, and another during a pre-delivery test flight in May 1978.|$|E
40|$|The {{requirement}} {{to reduce the}} specific fuel consumption of future advanced transport aircraft, {{in order to achieve}} definite improvements in the areas of economy and ecology, has resulted in dedicated activities among others in two fields of aeronautics. In the area of propulsion the current trend in the development of turbofan engines is directed towards very high and ultra high <b>bypass</b> <b>ratios</b> with the objective to lower the specific fuel consumption and the noise level. In the area of aerodynamics the laminarization of extensive surface areas of the airframe wetted by the external flow aims at a reduction of the skin friction drag. Since the higher <b>bypass</b> <b>ratios</b> of the advanced powerplants are associated with a growth in the engine nacelle dimensions, not only the skin friction drag rises, but the problem of engine-airframe integration is also intensified due to negative engine-airframe interactions. Therefore there is a challenge to an efficient integration of...|$|R
50|$|Bypass {{provides}} a lower fuel consumption {{for the same}} thrust, measured as thrust specific fuel consumption (grams/second fuel per unit of thrust in kN using SI units).

High bypass designs are the dominant type for commercial passenger aircraft and both civilian and military jet transports.|$|R

2500|$|The GE90-115B of the 777-200LR/300ER {{already have}} a 42:1 overall {{pressure}} ratio and 23:1 [...] compressor ratio.

5000|$|Recent {{analytic}} {{and experimental}} distributed propulsion studies suggest several improvements in aircraft performance. [...] They include fuel consumption efficiency, noise abatement, steep climbing for short {{take off and}} landing (STOL), novel control approaches (in particular eliminating control surfaces for roll, pitch and yaw moments), and high <b>bypass</b> <b>ratios.</b> It has also been suggested that smaller propulsors will be cheaper to manufacture and easier to handle during assembly and maintenance.|$|R
5000|$|In 1954 Rolls-Royce {{introduced}} {{the first commercial}} bypass engine, the Rolls-Royce Conway, with a 21,000 lbf (94 kN) thrust aimed at {{what was then the}} [...] "large end" [...] of the market. This was far too large for smaller aircraft such as the Sud Caravelle, BAC One-Eleven or Hawker Siddeley Trident which were then under design. Rolls then started work on a smaller engine otherwise identical in design derived from the larger RB.140/141 Medway - which itself had been cancelled after British European Airways (BEA) had demanded the downsizing of the Trident, the RB.163, using the same two-spool turbine system and a fairly small fan delivering <b>bypass</b> <b>ratios</b> of about 0.64:1. Designed by a team under Frederick Morley, the first versions of what had become the 'Spey' entered service in 1964, powering both the 1-11 and Trident. Several versions with higher power ratings were delivered through the 1960s, but development was ended nearing the 1970s due to the introduction of engines with much higher <b>bypass</b> <b>ratios,</b> and thus better fuel economy. Spey-powered airliners continued in widespread service until the 1980s, when noise limitations in European airports forced them from service.|$|R
50|$|The lower {{fan speed}} allows higher <b>bypass</b> <b>ratios,</b> leading to reduced fuel {{consumption}} and much reduced noise. The Bae 146 is fitted with geared turbofans {{and is still}} one of the quietest commercial aircraft. A large part of the noise reduction is due to reduced fan tip speeds. In conventional turbofans the fan tips exceed the speed of sound causing a characteristic drone, requiring sound deadening. Geared turbofans operate the fan at sufficiently low rotational speed to avoid supersonic tip speeds.|$|R
2500|$|The {{main problem}} facing the Il-86 project {{was the lack}} of a {{suitable}} engine. It was never resolved. By the close of the 1960s, the USA and the UK had turbofans with bypass ratios of 4 or 5 to 1. The first Soviet large turbofan, the Lotarev D-18T, did not appear before the mid-1980s. The Soloviev D-30, originally intended for the Il-86, was the most advanced Soviet civil aeroengine. It had a <b>bypass</b> <b>ratio</b> of 2.4 to 1 and aerodynamic clamshell thrust reversers. It failed to attain the required thrust, however: [...] "only after the lapse of three years that were spent on preparing the advanced development project did it become clear that these engines would not provide the necessary take-off performance." [...] The less-advanced Kuznetsov NK-8 series engine, adopted on March 26, 1975, had a <b>bypass</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1.15 to 1 and drag-inducing grilles over its cascade thrust reversers. Both these engines had high specific fuel consumptions and were noisy. Being ultimate developments of smaller engines, they could not offer growth to future Il-86s.|$|E

40|$|To prevent fish {{entrainment}} at the Tracy Pumping Plant, the Tracy Fish Collection Facility (TFCF) {{was designed}} to guide fish along a diagonal line of louvers into one of four primary bypass intakes.

The replacement intakes were developed in the laboratory for an expected range of field operating conditions. Hydraulic field evaluations were conducted to verify {{the performance of the}} new intakes. Velocity profiles were collected in the intake entrance and upstream of the intakes to document velocity field distributions. Results show that common field conditions such as <b>bypass</b> <b>ratios</b> less than 1. o and high debris loads adversely affect bypass performance by degrading uniformity in the vertical velocity profiles at the bypass entrances. Such uniformity is considered a performance indicator from past studies connected with fish salvage efficiency. Facility operation with <b>bypass</b> <b>ratios</b> greater than 1. 0 provides the best hydraulic conditions for efficient fish collection by minimizing flow disruption and eddying and promoting smooth flow acceleration into the intakes.
