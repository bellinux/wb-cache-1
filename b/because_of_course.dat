5|$|It is poetic {{justice that}} a {{helicopter}} {{is now at}} the heart of the Government's embarrassment and in the centre of their dilemma. Indeed, it was hard to blame the prison officer who observed that he thought it was the Minister for Defence paying an informal visit to Mountjoy Prison yesterday <b>because,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> we all know the Minister for Defence is wont to use helicopters, as somebody observed already, as other Ministers are wont to use State cars.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{developed}} his own special tactics, which differed {{significantly from the}} methods of most other pilots. (When attacking a Lufbery circle) he had to fly very slowly. He even {{took it to the}} point where he had to operate his landing flaps as not to fall down, <b>because,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> he had to fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|E
25|$|I don't want {{to answer}} the question, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> he does... Ash in Alien {{had nothing to do}} with Roy Batty, because Roy Batty is more humanoid, whereas Ash was more metal.|$|E

500|$|Besides {{the above}} {{discussion}} about contributions and caveats, the summit was noticed to paint an optimistic {{picture of the}} war in Afghanistan and Afghanistan's future. For instance, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said that [...] "real progress" [...] had been made in Afghanistan and that this was the main highlight of the summit. He strongly disagreed with visions of [...] "doom and gloom," [...] and added that five years after the defeat of the Taliban regime, Afghanistan had become a democratic society that is [...] "no longer a threat to the world." [...] He also believed that the defeat of the insurgency {{was only a matter of}} time, stating that the war in Afghanistan [...] "is winnable, it is being won, but it is not yet won <b>because,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> we have many challenges in Afghanistan." [...] In his opinion, these challenges included besides military engagement mainly reconstruction and development work.|$|E
2500|$|Granholm {{was twice}} {{mentioned}} as a possible U.S. Secretary of Energy, first in December 2008 when President-elect Obama was assembling his first-term Cabinet and again in December 2010, when it was rumoured that Secretary Steven Chu might resign. Her stance on domestic drilling is summarized by her quote [...] "If you opened up every single potential drilling opportunity in the United States, it would {{have the effect of}} lowering gas prices three cents, maybe. And that's <b>because,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> oil is traded on a global market." ...|$|E
2500|$|Criticism {{has been}} {{directed}} toward the show's unequal gender representation because the team of dogs is primarily male and includes only one main female. Cat Conway of Dan Abrams' The Mary Sue rhetorically asked, [...] "the police pup, firefighting pup, builder pup, sea-rescue pup, and whatever the hell Rocky does are all coded male, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> you couldn't have a female police dog, could you?" [...] Brandy King of the Center on Media and Child Health [...] "found the gender imbalance immediately noticeable" [...] while watching the program. Today's Parent noted in April 2015 that PAW Patrol images appeared frequently on Twitter with the hashtag [...] "#IncludeTheGirls".|$|E

5000|$|The Hockanum River is a {{river in}} Connecticut. Hockanum {{is derived from}} an Indian word meaning [...] "hook-shaped", so named <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> the river. The Hockanum {{neighborhood}} in East Hartford is named after it.|$|R

2500|$|Duterte {{admitted}} in December 2016 {{that he had}} been a user of the addictive opioid drug Fentanyl. He said that a doctor prescribed the drug to alleviate back pain and headaches, but that he would take more than he was prescribed: [...] "I was only given a fourth of , but no more, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> my doctor learned that I was using the whole patch because I felt better". Fentanyl is described by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse as [...] "a powerful synthetic opioid analgesic that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent". Duterte later denied that he was a drug addict, and a spokesman stated that he was not affected by side-effects of the drug, which include confusion, anxiety and hallucinations.|$|E
2500|$|Theologians, scientists, and skeptics {{have responded}} to claims that {{conflict}} with established scientific knowledge regarding {{the behavior of the}} Sun. Science writer Benjamin Radford maintains that [...] "the sun did not really dance in the sky. We know this <b>because,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> everyone on Earth is under the same sun, and if the closest dying star to us suddenly began doing celestial gymnastics a few billion other people would surely have reported it". Radford wrote that psychological factors such as the power of suggestion and pareidolia can better explain the reported events. According to Radford, [...] "No one suggests that those who reported seeing the Miracle of the Sun—or any other miracles at Fátima or elsewhere—are lying or hoaxing. Instead, they very likely experienced what they claimed to, though that experience took place mostly in their minds." ...|$|E

50|$|The riders {{generally}} {{use only}} {{first and second}} gear, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the <b>course's</b> tight turns. The speed range is therefore usually low or moderate.

2500|$|The spitball was not {{his only}} method for {{upsetting}} batters. Sports Illustrateds Joe Posnanski wrote of Perry, [...] "My favorite trick pitch of his was the old Puffball, where he would load up on rosin so that a puff of white smoke would release while he threw his pitches. This was made illegal {{somewhere along the way}} (<b>because</b> <b>of</b> Perry, <b>of</b> <b>course),</b> but it's so awesome — it's like the sort of thing one of the villains on the old Batman TV show would do." ...|$|R
