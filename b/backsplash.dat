2500|$|The BC Express Company, (which {{had been}} {{formerly}} known as Barnard's Express) had been freighting in the area since the 1860s during the Cariboo Gold Rush. They were also aware of the great changes that the railway would bring to this sparsely populated area. Thousands of construction workers would soon be working in-between Tête Jaune Cache and Fort George and {{millions of acres of}} land would be opened for settlement. The owner of the BC Express Company was now Charles Vance Millar who had purchased the company from Stephen Tingley in 1897. Millar decided to build two large and very luxurious steamers to accommodate the growing demand. Both were built at Soda Creek by Alexander Watson Junior, the son of the man who had built the Charlotte. The first company sternwheeler was launched in May 1910. It was named the BX and was piloted by Captain Owen Forrester Browne. She had stateroom accommodation for seventy and was also licensed to carry sixty deck passengers. Her paddlewheel was covered, so there was no <b>backsplash,</b> and a fine view could be enjoyed from the stern, which was where the ladies cabin was located. The BX boasted hot and cold running water and steam heat. She soon became the preferred steamer for passenger service and also won the government mail contract. Premier Richard McBride traveled on the BX in her sumptuous bridal suite, which featured, among other luxuries, a double brass bed with a silk eiderdown. She was the only steamer that could advertise a bi-weekly service from Soda Creek to Fort George. On Sunday and Wednesday mornings, she would leave Soda Creek at the break of dawn, usually 3am, and would reach Quesnel around noon. After unloading the mail and supplies for that town she would continue upriver until dark, tying up at a woodpile where her crew would have an opportunity to load more fuel aboard. This was called wooding up and it was a common activity. Most sternwheelers burnt upwards of four cords of wood an hour when they were travelling upstream and they could only carry three. She would arrive in Fort George the next day, usually around 11am. Her return trips downriver were far swifter, she would leave Fort George at 7am on Tuesdays and Saturdays, arriving in Soda Creek by 4;30pm of the same day. [...] For the 1911 season of navigation, the BC Express Company built a second sternwheeler, the BC Express which was nearly identical to the BX, only slightly smaller and lacking the covered paddlewheel. Her pilot was Captain Joseph P Bucey. The BC Express worked the route from Fort George to Tête Jaune Cache until 1913 and then joined her sister ship, the BX, on the Soda Creek to Fort George route, where they both worked on the construction of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway. In 1915, only the BX worked on the Fraser, and in '16 and '17 there were none at all. The BX returned to the river in 1918, still under Captain Browne, and was joined, when the need arose, by the BC Express.Then, in August 1919, the BX struck a reef named [...] "Woodpecker" [...] and sank in the Fort George Canyon while carrying 100 tons of concrete. Her sister ship towed her back to Quesnel for salvage but she never sailed again.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the orbital histories of Virgo galaxies {{at various stages}} of HI gas stripping. In particular, we compare the location of galaxies with different HI morphology in phase space. This method is a great tool for tracing the gas stripping histories of galaxies as they fall into the cluster. Most galaxies at the early stage of HI stripping {{are found in the}} first infall region of Virgo, while galaxies undergoing active HI stripping mostly appear to be falling in or moving out near the cluster core for the first time. Galaxies with severely stripped, yet symmetric, HI disks are found in one of two locations. Some are deep inside the cluster, but others are found in the cluster outskirts with low orbital velocities. We suggest that the latter group of galaxies belong to a "backsplash" population. These present the clearest candidates for <b>backsplashed</b> galaxies observationally identified to date. We further {{investigate the}} distribution of a large sample of HI-detected galaxies toward Virgo in phase space, confirming that most galaxies are stripped of their gas as they settle into the gravitational potential of the cluster. In addition, we discuss the impact of tidal interactions between galaxies and group preprocessing on the HI properties of the cluster galaxies, and link the associated star formation evolution to the stripping sequence of cluster galaxies.

5000|$|Group Challenge: The Kitchen Sink - The wolf pack's tasks include {{finishing}} the kitchen <b>backsplash,</b> plumbing the kitchen sink, and tiling over a Delta Upsilon emblem with new tile. Though Simon is nominally leader, Matt {{emerges as a}} capable second-in-command: he and Angela {{take charge of the}} tiling, while Cory gets to the plumbing and Deen with the <b>backsplash.</b> The tile goes along well, but Cory struggles with the plumbing due to not knowing how to solder (despite having asked Matt, who had plumbed most of the kitchen connections so far, for advice); it takes Cory some time to figure out that he had failed to apply flux to his copper, which was causing his leaks, though he manages to finish the plumbing and move on to installing the sink. Meanwhile, Deen's work in cutting more metal for the <b>backsplash</b> hits a snag when his angle grinder breaks down. The sink installation is further hampered by the fact that Simon had unwittingly also thrown out the sink's tiedowns three episodes ago along with the sink's instructions and template; they were finally given to Cory after Andrew had salvaged them from the garbage an episode ago, so that Cory could finally secure the sink in place. Simon's overreliance on Matt proves to be the group's downfall, as an [...] "emergency" [...] caused by Cory testing the sink plumbing sees Matt diverted from his tiling job to investigate a massive basement leak, leaving none of the tasks at hand finished when the three hours are complete. As Simon is visibly shaken by the ordeal (his blood pressure, by his own claim, being sky high), the wolf pack together engage in breathing exercises to calm him down instead of the traditional wolf howl.|$|E

5000|$|Charmont Apartments is an {{historic}} {{apartment building in}} Santa Monica, California which was built in 1928. Designed by architect Max Maltzman with elements of both the Mission Revival-Spanish Colonial Revival style and the Art Deco style, the Charmont was a luxurious high-rise when it was built. The blending of Spanish Colonial Revival and Art Deco elements was popular style in the 1920s and is sometimes known as [...] "Med-Deco."

50|$|A major {{means of}} {{transmission}} is through sinks, so staff should take extra precaution in maintaining sterile conditions. Hospitals could reduce transmission by creating sinks with designs that could reduce <b>backsplash.</b> Another method to reduce transmission from sink to sink {{is to have}} sink brushes in each room that would be for cleaning that individual sink alone. Hospital staff should be trained to never dispose of clinical waste down the sinks in patient rooms. A hospital in Melbourne, Australia, implemented similar strategies as these to reduce transmission and prevent further infection of more ICU patients.Armed {{with the knowledge of}} their status as CRE transmission sites, hospitals must take special care to monitor CRE outbreaks within their wards. Efficient and accurate detection of CRE is the first step.Enterobacteriaceae are most commonly found in the intestinal flora.

5000|$|To {{tie into}} the {{industrial}} theme, many homeowners resort to a kitchen island. These islands {{tend to be}} made of reclaimed wood or other earthy materials. A kitchen island can also contribute in separating a big room and providing a defined kitchen area. They can be paired with barstools that are made of wood or contain metal finishes. Open faced shelving and storage are big hits when it comes to an industrial kitchen. Free standing metal racks can also provide extra storage and can be beneficial in smaller rooms. If they have wheels, they can multitask. For example, low shelving on wheels can serve as a computer desk one day; the next day it can stand-in as a bar cart. Exposed overhead beams, brick and concrete are notable accents to the kitchen along with darker cabinets and shelving. Lighter colored floors or polished concrete are ways to incorporate this new style into any kitchen. To modernize this rather rustic look, decorative tiles look great in the kitchen. Tile as a <b>backsplash</b> can help create a modern twist and help liven up the space.|$|E
5000|$|Group Challenge: The Kegerator - Angela {{leads the}} wolf pack in {{creating}} a kegerator out of an old fridge, as well as installing the island's countertop (including the sink) in this edition of the [...] "wolf pack challenge".

Though {{there were a few}} small mishaps with the kegerator (resulting in Andrew nearly flipping out at Cory for not reading instructions), the kegerator is eventually finished. The same cannot be said of the island, as everyone struggles on the size of hole that needed to be cut for the sink (Simon having accidentally thrown out the template to trace for the right size two episodes ago when Deen had led everyone in framing the island) as well as how to keep the sink in place (as the instructions in doing so was also thrown out).

5000|$|When {{installed}} in a kitchen on standard (U.S) wall-mounted base unit cabinets, countertops are typically about 25-26 inches (635-660 mm) {{from front to back}} and are designed with a slight overhang on the front (leading) edge. This allows for a convenient reach to objects {{at the back of the}} countertop while protecting the base cabinet faces. In the UK the standard width is 600 mm (Approximately 24 inches). Finished heights from the floor will vary depending on usage but typically will be 35-36" [...] (889-914 mm), with a material thickness depending on that chosen. They may include an integrated or applied <b>backsplash</b> (UK: upstand) to prevent spills and objects from falling behind the cabinets. Kitchen countertops may also be installed on freestanding islands, dining areas or bars, desk and table tops, and other specialized task areas; as before, they may incorporate cantilevers, freespans and overhangs depending on application. The horizontal surface and vertical edges of the countertop can be decorated in manners ranging from plain to very elaborate. They are often conformed to accommodate the installation of sinks, stoves (cookers), ranges, and cooktops, or other accessories such as dispensers, integrated drain boards, and cutting boards.|$|E

Anthony's junk runs prove fruitful, and a barter deal with a mechanic across the street from the job site allows Jean-Marc to finish his last project—an exercise bike that could also recharge laptop batteries. The budget issue is resolved when Ross suggests that Michelle should [...] "charm" [...] Ron for the money when Ron refuses to answer Geoff's calls; Michelle's plea nets them $500, which they spend on cleaning up the floor and finding some cheap fabrics for upholstery. In the end, all of the projects are completed; however, Ron and a group of his clients will be making the final inspection together. On the final day, the team decides to throw a party in preparation for their arrival, with catering to be provided by one of the restaurants Cam runs. Gordie, however, leaves at the last moment, returning with some freegan food that he found on one last junk run. Though the team is appalled by what Gordie had done, they admit that the food that Gordie had found, which included more expensive items such as proscuitto, was not as bad as they had imagined (it was not until after the party that Gordie reveals that the food was, in fact, not freegan; he had also swapped some of the food for new food). In the end, Ron and his guests were split on whether to order a total tearout, but they eventually decide that the loft should stay. The Junk Raiders experiment is now complete, taking roughly $5400 to build from start to finish.|$|E

40|$|The Large Area Telescope (LAT) {{on board}} GLAST (Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope) due for launch in late 2007 will study the gamma-ray {{sky in the}} energy range 20 MeV to > 300 GeV. GLAST-LAT's {{improved}} sensitivity with respect to previous missions will {{increase the number of}} known gamma-ray blazars from about 100 to thousands, with redshifts up to z~ 3 - 5. Since gamma rays with energy above 10 GeV interact via pair-production with photons from the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), the systematic attenuation of GLAST-detected blazars as a function of redshift would constitute and effective and unique probe of the optical-UV EBL density and its evolution over cosmic history. Analysis techniques introduced in this dissertation make use of the large number of blazars detected by GLAST to study the collective behavior of their spectra as a function of redshift. These techniques are shown to offer powerful ways to help separate the common level of attenuation due to the EBL from the intrinsic peculiarities of individual blazars. The capability of GLAST to perform these measurements depends in great measure on the acceptance of the instrument to high energy photons (E > 10 GeV), which in previous space-experiments has been drastically reduced due to <b>backsplash</b> self-veto. This dissertation includes a study of the <b>backsplash</b> effect as measured with flight-like detectors during a beam test of the LAT calibration unit.
