5|$|A 2006 International Energy Agency forum {{presented}} {{costs for}} managing intermittency {{as a function}} of wind-energy's share of total capacity for several countries, as shown in the table on the right. Three reports on the wind variability in the UK issued in 2009, generally agree that variability of wind needs {{to be taken into account}} by adding 20% to the operating reserve, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not make the grid unmanageable. The additional costs, which are modest, can be quantified.|$|E
5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic pain. For those with chronic pain, it improves pain {{a little more than}} no treatment and about the same as medications, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not help with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be a reasonable method to try for those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E

5|$|At a {{distance}} of about eight light-minutes, the most frequently studied star is the Sun, a typical main-sequence dwarf star of stellar class G2 V, and about 4.6 billion years (Gyr) old. The Sun is not considered a variable star, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> undergo periodic changes in activity known as the sunspot cycle. This is an 11-year oscillation in sunspot number. Sunspots are regions of lower-than- average temperatures that are associated with intense magnetic activity.|$|E
5|$|But from {{whichever}} it is made, {{whether from}} oats, barley or wheat, it harms {{the head and}} the stomach, it causes bad breath and ruins the teeth, it fills the stomach with bad fumes, {{and as a result}} anyone who drinks it along with wine becomes drunk quickly; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> have the property of facilitating urination and makes one's flesh white and smooth.|$|E
5|$|Construction cost {{incurred}} on the Dugopolje–Ploče {{sector of}} the motorway between 2005 and 2008 was reported at 4.1 billion kuna and additional 1.8 billion kuna of construction expenses are planned {{until the end of}} 2012 (representing approximately 560 and 245 million euro, respectively).

5|$|Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has {{the unusual}} habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through {{evaporation}} {{has been proposed}} {{as a reason for}} this behavior, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not make any sense in the cold Andean habitat of the bird. Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white buildup of uric acid.|$|E
5|$|Somerset has few {{industrial}} centres, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> have {{a variety}} of light industry and high technology businesses, along with traditional agriculture and an increasingly important tourism sector, resulting in an unemployment rate of 2.5%. Unemployment is lower than the national average; the largest employment sectors are retail, manufacturing, tourism, and health and social care. Population growth in the county is higher than the national average.|$|E

5|$|The eastern quoll (D. viverrinus) is now {{considered}} extinct on mainland Australia; the last sighting there was in the 1960s. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> inhabit much of nearby Tasmania, {{where it can be}} found in rainforests, heathland, alpine areas, and scrubs. It can be found near farms, as it eats pasture food. The eastern quoll can also be seen in the Mount Field National Park.|$|E

5|$|This bird may {{sometimes}} join mixed-species feeding flocks in winter, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> {{not appear to}} share the resources found by accompanying tits and goldcrests, and may just be benefiting from the extra vigilance of a flock. Wood ants share the same habitat as the treecreeper, and also feed on invertebrates on tree trunks. The Finnish researchers found that where the ants have been foraging, there are fewer arthropods, and male treecreepers spent a shorter time on spruce trunks visited by ants.|$|E
5|$|This species {{lives on}} hard benthic substrates, {{typically}} rocks. It lives on pebbles, sometimes on boulders, and rarely on dead wood. It tolerates mild organic pollution, low oxygen content (down to below 2mg/liter) <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not tolerate {{long periods of}} droughts, or ice. It lives in mesotrophic waters, and sometimes in oligotrophic waters.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} short-finned pilot whales off the {{southwest}} coast of Tenerife in the Canary Islands {{has found the}} members of a pod maintained contact with each other through call repertoires unique to their pod. A later study found, when foraging at around 800 m deep, short-finned pilot whales make tonal calls. The number and length of the calls seem to decrease with depth despite being farther away from conspecifics at the surface. As such, the surrounding water pressure affects the energy of the calls, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not appear to affect the frequency levels.|$|E

5|$|Camel milk is {{a staple}} food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{does not}} react with water, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> slowly react with {{atmospheric}} oxygen {{to form a}} layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides.|$|E
