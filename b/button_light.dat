2500|$|Both VAM {{versions}} incorporated manual front disk brakes, front sway bar, floor-mounted three-speed manual transmissions, a 3.31:1 rear {{differential gear}} ratio, and the [...] I6 engine with a Carter YF one-barrel carburetor, 266 degree camshaft and 8.0:1 compression ratio rated at [...] at 3900rpm. Both versions were {{equipped with a}} 140km/h / 90mph speedometer, individual fold-down front seats, three-point seat belts, parcel shelf, front and rear ashtrays, cigarette lighter, locking glove-box, padded sun visors, carpeting, round dome light, inside hood release, rear spoiler, AM radio and antenna. The Gremlin X model included a Hurst linkage for the manual transmission, power steering, bumper guards, wheel trim rings, narrow longer volcano hubcaps, blacked out side glass and door window frames, wider 70X14 radial tires, front fender [...] "4.2 Litros" [...] decals, a sports grille designed by VAM, tinted windshield, AMC's three-arm spoked sports steering wheel with a VAM logo on the horn <b>button,</b> <b>light</b> group (lighter, glove box, courtesy and hood), bright molding package (rocker panels, wheel lips and drip rails), digital tachometer and retractable three-point seatbelts instead of the non-retractable fixed units. Door panels were the same in both versions except that the X had lower carpet inserts and map pouches. The roof rack that was standard on the base model was optional on the X version. The heater was optional on the base Gremlin with manual transmission and standard for other versions. The base Gremlin had few options, while the Gremlin X offered a greater list. The base model offered bumper guards, power steering, light group, bright molding package, tinted windshield, sports steering wheel and wheel trim rings. The X versions could be ordered with air conditioning, reading dome light, AM/FM radio, rear defogger, and sunroof. Options shared by both versions were limited to a TorqueFlite A904 three-speed automatic transmission, power brakes, passenger's side remote mirror, and dual remote controlled mirrors.|$|E
50|$|The Franklin and Amelia Walton House is a Prairie School style {{bungalow}} {{built in}} 1916 in Centerville, Utah, United States. The home remains in almost original condition, including original kitchen cabinets, push <b>button</b> <b>light</b> switches, original woodwork, casement windows and hardware.

50|$|One spring post (green, left) is rigidly {{fixed to}} the handle (orange), the other spring post (green, right) is {{fastened}} {{to the base of}} the blade. The main spring (red) is under tension but the blade cannot eject because the spring mounted <b>button</b> (<b>light</b> grey, its spring not shown) is resting in a notch in the blade. The cocking arm (blue) emerges through the base of the handle; friction with the handle holds it in place.|$|E

40|$|Duke Lumsden {{operates}} a candy shop in Tacoma, Wash. Duke is blind, {{yet he has}} no trouble differentiating between the values of currency he handles {{in the course of}} business. He is aided by a spinoff from space-developed optical-electronic scanning technology known as the Paper Money Identifier. The PMI is manufactured by EMR Ltd., Los Angeles. It's not distinguishable by the human eye, but each denomination of American currency has a unique distribution of colors. This fact enables the PMI {{to tell the difference between}} different denominations of paper money. The device, the size of a cigarette pack, emits a narrow beam of invisible infrared light. This beam reacts to the reflectivity of the colors on the bill and causes an oscillator to generate an audible signal. As Duke passes his PMI lengthwise along the back of a bill, he hears a distinctive series of tones that identifies each denomination. Duke Lumsden is very pleased with the paper money identifier, which he got through Tacoma's Technology Transfer Center. He not only handles paper money with ease, but he has discovered another use for the device. Before receiving the PMI, he had difficulty operating his tape recorder because he couldn't determine which track the tape was using; now his PMI tells him, by reacting to the different colors on the switch <b>button</b> <b>light...</b>|$|E
40|$|Two {{important}} {{applications of}} the fiber Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FFPI) sensor are investigated: (1) an optical binary switch for aerospace application, and (2) an FFPI weigh-in-motion sensor for measuring the weight of trucks traveling down a highway. In the fiber optical switch, the FFPI sensor is bonded to a copper cantilever to sense the elongation of cavity length induced by force applied {{to the end of}} the cantilever via a pushed <b>button.</b> <b>Light</b> from a superluminescent diode light source passes through a scanned Michelson interferometer and is reflected from a sensing FFPI and a reference FFPI to produce a fringe pattern. A secondary interferometer uses a distributed feedback laser light source to compensate for irregularities in the mechanical scanning rate of the moving stage to achieve precision measurement of the optical path difference. The system is calibrated by applying known weights to the cantilever. The elongation measured by the FFPI sensor shows excellent linearity as a function of the force applied, and little hysteresis was observed. By comparing the measured force to a threshold, the system produces a binary signal that indicates the state of the pilotactuated system; i. e., whether or not the button has been pushed. In FFPI weigh-in-motion sensors system, the FFPI sensors are installed in metal bars so that they will experience the strain induced by applied loads and are connected to the Signal Conditioning Unit (SCU). The SCU determines the induced phase shift in the FFPI and produces voltage outputs proportional to the phase shifts. Laboratory Material Testing System tests show that the fiber optic sensor response is a fairly linear function of the axial displacement. In highway tests the FFPI sensors showed strong responses and consistently reproduced the expected characteristics of truck wheel crossings. A falling weight deflectometer was used to calibrate the sensor response and predict unknown loads. All sensors in steel bars and aluminum bars showed excellent repeatability and accurate predictions, with an average relative percentage error within 2 %. The study on sensor response variation with applied load positions shows a bell shaped distribution. Truck tests on the road sensors indicate that the repeatability of wheel crossings at similar position is good. The sensor can accurately measure axle spacing, speed, and truck class...|$|E
50|$|A {{sequence}} of <b>buttons</b> <b>light</b> up and their colors are spoken, starting with one {{button on the}} first round, two on the next, et cetera.

50|$|Early {{machines}} designed {{primarily for}} commuters are essentially receipt printers,accepting only coins (no bills) and prepaid magnetic TransitChek-like cards - not credit cards.Passengers must first insert coins (amount deposited is displayed), then press numerous <b>lighted</b> <b>buttons</b> sequentially to specify traveller count, train class, single/return/concessionary, and destination. <b>Buttons</b> <b>light</b> up only when adequate coins are inserted. TVMs sell only unreserved single/round-trips to local destinations (<50 miles) {{from the current}} station. Earlier button presses constrain subsequent choices: destinations for which insufficient fares were paid (in selected train class) do not activate and have no effect.|$|R

Frustrated, PC presses the button repeatedly, causing GIVE UP and ON VISTA to light up alternately.|$|R
