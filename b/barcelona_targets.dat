40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{technical}} brief is to investigate the comparability between two early childhood education and care indicators currently used by the European Commission – namely the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>target</b> and the ET 2020 ECEC benchmark – and to identify methodological differences and common traits that may have implications in their use for policy-making. Results show that, despite being potentially similar measures of participation of children in early childhood education and care in the different countries, they are essentially different in their nature as they cover different groups of individuals. Additionally, {{the fact that they}} use different datasets, namely administrative data from UOE and survey data from EU-SILC, implies that they follow diverse data collection protocols; in particular, the use of EU-SILC survey data brings the risk of not having a fully representative sample of the children population; and exposes data to respondent and interviewer’s biases, which further contributes to the existing differences between them. Notwithstanding, results provided in the brief suggest that the different age composition of the two indicators could explain a consistent part of the difference in the overall shares; in the majority of countries, for age groups 4 and 5, numbers are quite similar. Thus, while still taking into account all the caveats explained in this document, we could conclude that for these age groups results could be equally used for policy support. Some suggestions for the improvement of the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>target</b> sub-indicator for the ET 2020 ECEC benchmark within the Joint Assessment Framework are also proposed. JRC.

30|$|There {{are several}} {{challenges}} {{that have to}} be met. Perhaps the biggest ones are the difficulties in implementing polices arising from the decentralized nature of Hungarian administration. There are more than 3, 100 local authorities. Many of them are small with a population of less than 2, 000 people, with the same duties as the bigger ones, but with small budgets, which are not enough to finance services. Another challenge is the divergence of interests between central and local governments, which has consequences for the implementation of policies and the operation of child care centers. Whereas access issues are important for the central government due to plans to increase women’s labor force participation, and to meet the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>targets,</b> local authorities often have other priorities. Consequently, access to places in nurseries is uneven, with rural areas usually lacking services. The division between early education and care provision (nurseries and kindergartens coming under the authority of different ministries) makes the provision of children’s services even more difficult. Improving access to childcare and kindergarten for children in under-served rural settlements, for children with disabilities, and for Roma children were recommended by the OECD (2004).|$|E

40|$|The {{past decade}} has shown a rising {{popularity}} {{of the notion of}} the knowledge-based economy. In Europe this has led to important political paradigms such as the Lisbon Accord and the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>targets,</b> which have become signposts for R&D policy in the EU. The relationship between knowledge and economic growth is often studied in a conceptual and empirical context by addressing correlations between these factors (on the basis of e. g. the new growth theory and endogenous growth theory). This paper takes a complementary, more exploratory route. Starting from the notions of modern knowledge and growth theory, it examines views and attitudes of experts and industrial, R&D or research leaders to identify the critical success factors that are decisive for economic dynamism of a region or country. Knowledge is conceived of as a social capital asset that may reduce or maintain accelerated economic growth. In our study, a sample of ‘knowledge experts ’ is used to identify the relative importance attached by these experts to the various factors that shape the force field of a knowledge-based economy. The results are analyzed using statistical regression methods and common factor analysis. The study is carried out for different types of regions / countries in the world (the Netherlands...|$|E

The objective of this paper is analyzing influence of public R&D and businesses R&D in Croatia on its economic growth. In general, Croatia is still in a process of transition, industrial restructuring and integration into the EU economy.

40|$|R&D {{intensity}} {{indicators are}} increasingly used {{not only for}} international comparisons, but also as targets for policies stimulating research. The two are of course intimately linked: it makes little sense to set a quantitative policy target when not knowing whether it is high or low compared to economies at similar stages of development. This paper reflects upon the (<b>Barcelona)</b> <b>target</b> to lift R&D spending to 3 % of GDP, set by the EU as {{a key part of}} its (Lisbon) strategy for growth and jobs. The paper provides empirical evidence showing the target of 3 % of GDP for R&D expenditures in the EU as a whole to be overly ambitious, even though some Member States are above. It also argues that the EU's strategy is short on policy instruments to reach this target. In fact, what appears a simple target actually sums up public R&D, over which decision makers have direct control, and private R&D, which may be partly publicly funded but which can be influenced only indirectly. In this respect, it is clear that national policy-makers {{have to take into account}} that the bulk of R&D is conducted by relatively few companies that mostly operate on a global scale.

40|$|Innovation in the European Union {{remains weak}} {{according}} {{to a number of}} key ¿input¿ indicators, especially R&D investment by the business sector. Furthermore, there are relatively few signs of progress despite the 3 % <b>Barcelona</b> <b>target</b> established in 2000 (EC-Key Figures 2010). Compared to the United States the EU-private R&D deficit primarily manifests itself in ICT goods and services. This correlates with a lower specialisation of the EU economy in these R&D intensive, high growth sectors of the 1990 s (O¿Mahoney & van Ark (2003), Denis et al. (2005), EC Key Figures (2005), Moncada et al. (2009)). Further, firm-level evidence suggests that the EU¿s R&D deficit in the information technology sector may reflect constraints on the rapid growth of new, technology-based entrants in the EU compared to the US. From this firm-level perspective, the continued business R&D deficit seems a symptom rather than a cause of the EU¿s weakness in innovation; the cause seems rooted in the structure and dynamics of EU industry and enterprise. Europe¿s innovation gap results from an inappropriate industrial structure in which small and new firms fail to {{play a significant role in}} the dynamics of the industry, especially in the high-tech intensive sectors. This is illustrated by their inability to enter and grow to become market leaders. The creative destruction process encounters significant obstacles in the EU, weakening Europe's growth potential position (Aghion et al. (2007). This structural EU innovation deficit story has attracted many supporters. But it has received little or no thorough empirical investigation. This Policy Contribution aims to address this ¿evidence gap¿. To this end, we decompose the latest JRC-EC-IPTS Industrial R&D Scoreboard (European Commission 2008) of leading innovators in terms of global R&D expenditures by age cohort. We compare the innovation profile of young versus old leading innovators in the scoreboard and examine how the contribution of young leading innovators can explain the EU¿s lagging leading innovation performance. We find that the EU has fewer young firms among its leading innovators. But this effect only accounts for about one-third of the US-EU differential. The largest part of the differential is due to the fact that young leading innovators in the EU are less R&D intensive than their US counterparts. Further unraveling shows that this is almost entirely due to a different sectoral composition. Young leading innovators in the US are found in R&D intensive young sectors, with biotechnology and Internet being the clearest cases. We thus confirm that the EU-US private R&D gap is indeed mostly a structural issue. Bridging this gap will require the EU to nurture more young firms in young sectors, to grow to become young leading innovators. JRC. DDG. J. 3 -Knowledge for Growt...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to unravel the social {{distribution}} of childcare policies: who beneﬁ ts from government investment on public childcare? If childcare policies are mainly used by those already working, and (scarce) budgetary resources thus end up with the higher income brackets, genuine concern arises about the distributional consequences of childcare policies on the one hand, and its effectiveness as an instrument to activate mothers with young children into the labour market on the other. Answering this question is a complex endeavour, because one has to simultaneously take into account the (possibly income-differentiated) tariff structure of childcare services and private childcare costs (parental fees), government expenditures (subsidies to childcare providers) and tax concessions. In this contribution, we develop a ﬁ ne-grained analysis to reveal the distributional impact of public childcare for two countries (Flanders/Belgium and Sweden) already reaching the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>targets</b> for under 3 s and interpret the results in a European perspective. We ﬁ nd that, although both cases report high coverage rates, Sweden and Flanders have very different and even opposite distributional outcomes. Both examples provide us with valuable lessons on the redistributive nature of “new risk policies” and the effectiveness of childcare as an instrument of labour market activation. ...|$|E

Examination of three areas of reconciliation, that is, childcare services, maternity and parental leaves, and parent-friendly organization of work, reveals strong tensions between the unpaid labour of care and paid market labour. Reconciliation of work and family appears challenging for mothers and fathers alike, but {{the nature of the}} problem differs - women face greater obstacles to paid employment and men to involvement in family and care.

40|$|The World Wide Web {{has grown}} so {{fast in the}} last decade and it is today a vital daily part of people. The Internet is used for many {{purposes}} by an ever growing number of users, mostly for daily activities, tasks, and services. To face the needs of users, an efficient and effective access to information is required. To deal with this task, the adoption of Information Retrieval and Information Filtering techniques is continuously growing. Information Re-trieval (IR) is the field concerned with searching for documents, information within documents, and metadata about documents, as well as searching for structured storage, relational databases, and the World Wide Web. Infor- mation Filtering deals with the problem of selecting relevant information for a given user, according to her/his preferences and interest. Nowadays, Web advertising {{is one of the major}} sources of income for a large number of websites. Its main goal is to suggest products and services to the still ever growing population of Internet users. Web advertising is aimed at suggesting products and services to the users. A significant part of Web ad-vertising consists of textual ads, the ubiquitous short text messages usually marked as sponsored links. There are two primary channels for distributing ads: Sponsored Search (or Paid Search Advertising) and Contextual Ad-vertising (or Content Match). Sponsored Search advertising is the task of displaying ads on the page returned from a Web search engine following a query. Contextual Advertising (CA) displays ads within the content of a generic, third party, webpage. In this thesis I study, develop, and evaluated novel solutions in the field of Contextual Advertising. In particular, I studied and developed novel text summarization techniques, I adopted a novel semantic approach, I studied and adopted collaborative approaches, I started a conjunct study of Contex-tual Advertising and Geo-Localization, and I study the task of advertising in the field of Multi-Modal Aggregation. The thesis is organized as follows. In Chapter 1, we briefly describe the main aspects of Information Retrieval. Following, the Chapter 2 shows the problem of Contextual Advertising and describes the main contributes of the literature. Chapter 3 sketches a typical adopted approach and the eval-uation metrics of a Contextual Advertising system. Chapter 4 is related to the syntactic aspects, and its focus is on text summarization. In Chapter 5 the semantic aspects are taken into account, and a novel approach based on ConceptNet is proposed. Chapter 6 proposes a novel view of CA by the adoption of a collaborative filtering approach. Chapter 7 shows a prelim-inary study of Geo Location, performed in collaboration with the Yahoo!

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is to make {{a contribution}} to the literature on Making Work Pay policy. This thesis consists of four separate chapters of which three focus on the labor supply decision of households and how different policy reforms affect the labor supply decision. Each chapter answers a specific research question and, by using a solid theoretical framework, provides policy recommendations. We devote one specific chapter to a presentation of the most relevant literature on labor supply modeling. Each chapter is based on Belgian data and, hence, applies the research question on the Belgian situation. However, the methodological framework presented in each chapter can also be used for empirical studies for other countries. In order to evaluate the potential labor supply effects of policy reforms, labor supply models need to be estimated. There exists, however, a substantial amount of literature on labor supply modeling. Therefore, the first goal of Chapter 2 is to provide an overview of the existing literature and to position this dissertation in therelevant academic literature on labor supply modeling. As will be discussed in this chapter, this thesis adopts two specific methodologies thatare to a certain degree similar to each other but differ in some important aspects. It would be tempting for the reader to compare effects across chapters. However, each chapter is estimated on a different sample which makes a direct comparison difficult and hard to interpret. Therefore, the second purpose of chapter 2 is to provide a detailed discussion ofboth models and estimate them on exactly the same dataset which enablesus to directly compare both models and stress the important differencesand similarities between the two. We examine how both models perform inreproducing the observed household's choices and analyze whether the behavioral responses differ by deriving labor supply elasticities. Given this comparison, we justify the choices we made regarding the methodological framework chosen in each chapter to model labor supply. A lot of research has already been done on the effectiveness of Making WorkPay policies. However, an element that has received less attention is the importance of the scope of information that policy makers have for the design of their instrument. Chapter 3 of this dissertation emphasizes that the effectiveness of MWP-policies depends to a large extent on the information that policy makers have available. As the main purpose of Making Work Pay policies is to enlarge the incentives for low skilledindividuals to step into the labor market, the necessary condition to effectively implement such policies is the government's ability to correctly identify the low skilled individuals. If individuals only report their gross income, Making Work Pay instruments in which eligibility depends on some level of this income concept will create disincentive effects. High-skilled individuals might have incentives {{to reduce the amount of}} hours worked l in order to have lower income to be eligible to the benefit. If, on the other hand, people report gross income and the actual amount of hours worked, Making Work Pay policies can be designed that only target the low skilled individuals and the amount of distortions created by the system will be lower than in regime T. We quantify the differential positive and normative effects of Making Work Pay instruments in both scenario's by evaluating the employment effects of the Belgian Workbonus and a hypothetical budget neutral in-work tax credit. We show that policymakers are able to target the low skilled population more effectively if the scope of information is enlarged. In addition to these positive effects, our analysis shows that the implementation of an instrument based on wages leads to a higher social welfare than the implementation of a budget neutral instrument in which eligibility is based on actual earnings. Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 target Making Work Pay policies that focus on both the tax-benefit system and institutional features related to childcare and labor supply. Children have an important impact on labor supply decisions of households and it is therefore interesting to investigate how policy related to childcare and labor supply might contribute to making work pay. The availability of different childcare options, their quality and their price are major determinants of the work-family balance of households with (young) children. These issues figure also highly on the policy agenda, whichis illustrated by the <b>Barcelona</b> childcare <b>targets</b> formulated in 2002 bythe European Council, and confirmed in 2005. According to these targets, each country should provide childcare by 2010 to at least 90 % of children between 3 years old and the mandatory school age and at least 33 % ofchildren under 3 years of age. They believe that having access to more and better childcare is beneficial for both the children and induces women to start working. The focus Chapter 4 remains exclusively on labor supply and how childcare policy might influence the labor supply decision of households. This chapter builds on a structural labor supply model as proposed by Van Soest (1995), using a discrete random utility maximization model, but extends this framework to take childcare policy into account. We investigate how sensitive maternal labor supply iswith respect to changes in the price and availability of childcare and make policy recommendations whether policy should focus on the former orthe latter. The analysis suggests that, in line with other findings in the literature, policy makers should rather focus on the availability than on the price of childcare to foster employment. Chapter 5 goes one step further by modeling both the childcare and labor supply decision of households. In this second stream, known as the Simultaneous approach, households make their employment and childcare decisions simultaneously which allows for an investigation of the link between both,rather than focusing only on the former. As such, households additionally choose the amount of childcare and childcare type, next to the labor supply decision. This type of modeling is particularly interesting to investigate how the simultaneous choice of labor supply and childcare change after specific policy reforms. In march 2012 the Flemish parliament approved a decree containing a substantial reform in the Flemish childcare sector. The main goal is to make childcare more accessible, affordableand professional for each household with young children as they believethat childcare is essential for both economic and educational purposes of the household. One of the targets is that 50 % of all preschool children by 2016 find suitable childcare and this percentage increases up to 100 % by 2020. We analyze the behavioral effects of this reform and the results suggest that the relative importance of informal childcare declines in favor of formal childcare arrangements. Additionally, the participation rate of mothers increases further as they are less restricted in their childcare choice. status: publishe...|$|R
