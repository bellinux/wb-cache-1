50|$|The {{syndrome}} {{appears in}} infancy. Affected children appear normal at birth but usually fail to thrive {{during their first}} year. The syndrome may predominate in males (71%). Most cases occur in children of Jewish descent, especially among Ashkenazi Jews. The disease is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. It is also commonly recognized as a <b>betalipoprotein</b> deficiency or abetalipoproteinemia.|$|E
40|$|We {{have begun}} a {{measured}} genotype {{approach to the}} genetic analysis of lipid and lipoprotein variability. This approach enables one to simultaneously estimate the frequencies and effects of alleles at specific loci along with the residual polygenetic variance component. In this study we consider the contribution of three common alleles at the locus coding for apolipoprotein E to interindividual variation of total cholesterol, <b>betalipoprotein,</b> and triglyceride levels. A sample of 102 nuclear families consisting of 434 individuals was studied. The frequencies of the ε 2, ε 3, and ε 4 alleles in this sample are 0 · 137, 0 · 740, and 0 · 123, respectively. In separate analyses of cholesterol and <b>betalipoprotein</b> levels, a complete model that includes {{the effects of the}} six apo E genotypes, unmeasured polygenes, and individual specific environmental effects fits these data significantly better than a reduced model that does not include the effects of the apo E polymorphism or a reduced model that does not include the effects of polygenes. On the average the ε 2 allele lowers total cholesterol and <b>betalipoprotein</b> levels by 0 · 425 mmol/l and 0 · 811 units, respectively. The ε 4 allele is associated with an average increase of these phenotypes by 0 · 255 mmol/l and 0 · 628 units, respectively. Simultaneous estimates of the interindividual variability of total cholesterol levels attributable to the apo E polymorphism and to residual polygenic effects are 8 % and 56 %, respectively. For <b>betalipoprotein</b> levels, we simultaneously estimate these values to be 7 % and 42 %, respectively. A reduced model including the effects of polygenes but not the effects of the apo E polymorphism fitted the triglyceride data as well as the complete model. The estimate of the fraction of interindividual variability associated with polygenetic effects was 26. 5 %. We review our present understanding of the genetic architecture underlying variability of cholesterol levels in the population at large and infer {{that the majority of the}} genetic variability may be accounted for by polymorphic gene loci with moderate effects on cholesterol levels...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Eight {{patients}} with abetalipoproteinaemia have been followed for 3 - 4 to 15 - 8 years. Management included dietary fat restriction and supplements of the fat-soluble vitamins A, E, and K. In the 3 oldest patients serial studies of retinal and neurological function suggest that treatment with large doses of oral vitamin E may have delayed the development or {{progression of the}} neuro-logical and retinal lesions. The clinical features of abetalipoproteinaemia were first described by Bassen and Kornzweig in 1950 {{and it is now}} 15 years since three independent groups showed the absence of <b>betalipoprotein</b> in this condition (Lamy et al., 1960; Mabry et al., 1960; Salt et al., 1960). It has now been shown that the primary defect is failure of synthesis of apo B, which is the major apoprotein of <b>betalipoprotein</b> and is also essential for the formation of pre-beta-lipoprotein and chylomicra (Gotto et al., 1971). The disorder usually presents in infancy with symptoms due to malabsorption of fat which can be satisfactorily treated by restriction of dietary fat (Lloyd and Muller, 1972). In occasional patients the diagnosis has been delayed until adult life whe...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A {{patient is}} {{reported}} with hypobetalipoproteinaemia and clinical features resembling the Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome (abetalipoproteinaemia) more completely than previously described. This supports {{a link between}} hypobetalipoproteinaemia and abetalipoproteinaemia and it is sug-gested that the Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome has a wide spectrum with serum <b>betalipoprotein</b> rang-ing from absent to normal. It is likely that there are different genetic entities with similar end results. Absent serum P-lipoprotein (abetalipoproteinaemia) is usually associated with the Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome (Bassen and Kornzweig, 1950) which, in its complete form, is characterised by a Friedreich's type ataxia, acanthocytosis, steatorrhoea, fat-loading of the small-intestinal enterocytes, and atypical retinitis pigmentosa. Reduced, but not absent, serum f-lipoprotein (hypobetalipoproteinaemia) is not usually associated with clinical illness, being detected on routine screen-ing, but investigation of asymptomatic subjects has, on occasions, revealed acanthocytosis (Biemer and McCammon, 1975) and fat-loading of enterocytes (Cottrill et al., 1974). However, of the 17 families reported (Kuo and Bassett, 1962; van Buchem et al. ...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{cases with}} {{various types of}} {{pediatric}} malabsorption syndromes were evaluated. The clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, pathophysiology, and histopathological descriptions of each patient were analyzed {{in an effort to}} clear the pathogenesis of the malabsorption syndromes and the treatments were undertaken. The cases studied, included　one patient with cystic fibrosis, two with lactose intolerance with lactosuria(Durand type), one with primary intestinal lymphangiectasia, two with familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, one with Hartnup disease, one with congenital chroride diarrhea, one with acrodermatitis enteropathica, one with intestinal nodular lymphoid hyperplasia(NLH), five with intractable diarrhea of early infancy and four with glycogenosis type Ia. Each case description and outcome is described below : 1. A 15 -year-old Japanese boy with cystic fibrosis presented with severe symptoms, including pancreatic insufficiency, bronchiectasis, pneumothorax and hemoptysis. His prognosis was poor. Analysis of the CFTR genes of this patient revealed a homozygous large deletion from intron 16 to 17 b． 2 ．In the sibling case of Durand type lactose intolerance, the subjects’ disaccaridase activity of the small bowel, including lactase, were within normal limits. The results of per oral and per intraduodenal lactose tolerance tests confirmed lactosuria in both. These observations suggested, not only an abnormal gastric condition, but also duodenal and intestinal mucosal abnormal permeability of lactose. 3 ．In the case of primary intestinal lymphangiectasia, the subject had a lymphedematous right arm and hand, a grossly coarsened mucosal pattern of the upper gastrointestinal tract(identified via radiologic examination) and the presence of lymphangiectasia(confirmed via duodenal mucosal biopsy). The major laboratory findings were hypoalbuminemia, decreased immunoglobulin levels and lymphopenia resulting from loss of lymph fluid and protein into the gastrointestinal tract. 4 ．In two cases of heterozygous familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, serum total cholesterol and <b>betalipoprotein</b> levels were very low. The subjects presented with symptoms and signs of acanthocytosis and fat malabsorption. Further, one subject had neurological abnormalities such as mental retardation and severe cbnvulsions. Treatment with MCT formula diet corrected the lipid malabsorption. 5 ．A 5 -year-old girl presented with pellagra-like rashes, mental retardation and cerebellar ataxia. An oral tryptophan(Trp) and dipeptide(Trp-Phe) loading test were conducted and the renal clearance of amino acids was also evaluated in this patient and in controls. Following the oral Trp loading test, plasma levels of Trp indicated a lower peak in the case, reaching a maximum at 60 minutes. On the other hand, the oral dipeptide(Trp-Phe) loading test in the Hartnup patient showed the peak Trp plasma level was the same as the control subjects. The renal clearance of neutral amino acids in this case increased to levels 5 to 35 times normal. 6 ．In the case of congenital chloride diarrhea, the subject had secondary lactose intolerance, dehydration, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyperreninemia and metabolic alkalosis. The chloride content of her fecal fluid was very high. The concentrations were 89 - 103 mEq/ 1. In contrast, her urine was chloride-free. The subject’s growth and development improved after treatment with lactose free formura and oral replacement of the fecal loses of water, NaCl and KCI. Unfortunately, the patient died　of a small bowel intussusception. The kidney histopathological finding was　juxtaglomerular hyperplasia by a necropsy. 7 ．In the case of acrodermatitis enteropathica, the subject had characteristic skin lesions, low serum zinc levels and ALPase activity. An oral ZnSO 4 loading test and intestinal mucosal histology by a peroral biopsy were conducted. The serum zinc peak level was 2 hours after the oral ZnSO 4 loading test. Infant formula alone could not maintain normal serum zinc ranges. Light microscopic studies of the intestinal villous architecture showed a normal pattern. However, ultrastructual examination of several epithelial cells revealed numerous intracellular vesicles. After zinc therapy, these changes were decreased. The lesions were postulated as the secondary result of zinc deficiency. 8 ．A 12 -year-old girl presented with hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent　infections, chronic diarrhea and intestinal NLH. A barium meal and follow-through examination showed multiple nodules throughout the stomach and intestine. The nodules, all uniform in size, were 2 mm diameter. The barium enema did not show NLH in the colon. Mucosal biopsy of the stomach and jejunum revealed the typical histology of NLH in the lamina propria. Also, achlorhydria was present in this patient and her serum gastrin levels were very high; 315 - 775 pg/ml. 9 ．In 4 cases of intractable diarrhea in early infancy(by Avery G B), a jejunal biopsy showed shortening villi and nonspecific enterocolitis. Some patients were found with only low lactase or low lactase and sucrase levels. An electron microscope analysis of the small bowel in 2 　cases showed alterations:increased pinocytosis in microvillus membranes and lysosomes by endocytosis of undigested macromolecular substances． I postulated that the stated evidence was causative of this clinical profile. 10 ．I frequently observed diarrhea as a clinical manifestation in glycogenosis type la and lipid malabsorption in one case. The light and electron photomicrographs showed intestinal absorption cells with the glycogen deposits in the inferior devision of nuclei. わが国では, 嚢胞性線維症やセリアック病の頻度が欧米に比較して極端に低いため, 吸収不全に関する病態, 診断, 治療の研究が遅れていた．近年になって, 内視鏡の発達, 遺伝子診断, 多種類の治療乳, 経静脈栄養法,さらには臓器移植へと展開され, 患児の適格な診断や病態の把握によって治療効果が期待されるようになった. 乳幼児の小腸生検が, 器具の改良により比較的安全, 且つ容易に施行出来るようになり, かつては暗黒地帯であった吸収上皮の病変が把握され, 種々の疾患や症候群に分類されている. 表 1 は著者が分類を試みたものである. 中には日常診療で遭遇するのが稀なものがあり, 九大小児科在籍時の昭和 45 年から, 昭和 54 年以降は, 福岡赤十字病院で平成 15 年までの 34 年間に経験した次に記述する吸収不全症候群につき, 臨床像, 検査所見, 消化吸収状態, 治療および小腸生検が可能で診断や病態の解明に有用であるものについては, 組織学的特徴(光顕・電顕), 酵素学的所見につき検討した...|$|E
