The optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology is analogous to ultrasound backscatter microscopy except reflections of light are detected rather than sound. The OCT technology combines high-resolution in vivo imaging in a diode-based <b>benchtop</b> <b>instrument</b> capable of micron-scale resolution in transparent and non-transparent biological specimens. In this paper, we examine the potential of using OCT for the investigation of developing neural morphology. To demonstrate the capabilities of this technique in assessing neural development, we have chosen to image early normal and abnormal neural morphology in a common developmental biology model, Xenopus laevis. In vivo images clearly identify gross and subtle differences in neural structure and may offer {{an alternative to the}} costly and time-consuming process of repeated histological preparation for neural developmental studies. Because imaging can be performed rapidly and repeatedly, the morphological changes of single specimens can be followed throughout development.

50|$|A Benchtop nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectrometer (Benchtop NMR spectrometer) refers to a Fourier transform nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} (FT-NMR) spectrometer that is significantly more compact and portable than the conventional equivalents, such that it is portable and can reside on a laboratory benchtop.

Instead of requiring dedicated infrastructure, rooms and extensive installations these <b>benchtop</b> <b>instruments</b> can be placed directly on the bench in a lab and moved as necessary (e.g., to the fumehood). These spectrometers offer improved workflow, even for novice users, as they are simpler and easy to use.

The newly developed next-generation sequencing method is capable of broad genomic DNA sequencing with high throughput and can help explore novel correlations between genetic variants and cardiomyopathies. Methods and Results-—A proband from a multigenerational family with 3 live patients and 1 unrelated patient with clinical diagnoses of RCM underwent a next-generation sequencing workflow based on a custom AmpliSeq panel, including 64 candidate pathogenic genes for cardiomyopathies, on the Ion Personal Genome Machine high-throughput sequencing <b>benchtop</b> <b>instrument.</b> The selected panel contained a total of 64 genes that were reportedly associated with inherited cardiomyopathies. All patients fulfilled strict criteria for RCM with clinical characteristics, echocardiography, and/or cardiac magnetic resonance findings. The multigenerational family with 3 adult RCM patients carried an identical nonsense MYBPC 3 mutation, and the unrelated patient carried a missense mutation in the MYBPC 3 gene. All of these results were confirmed by the Sanger sequencing method. Conclusions-—This study demonstrated that MYBPC 3 gene mutations, revealed by next-generation sequencing, were associated with familial and sporadic RCM patients. It is suggested that the next-generation sequencing platform with a selected panel provides a highly efficient approach for molecular diagnosis of hereditary and idiopathic RCM and helps build new genotype– phenotype correlations.

This value is significantly lower than the maximum Cr content permissible in drinking waters and it is better or comparable with those obtained in other published works based on the use of solid phase extraction or liquid phase microextraction in combination with atomic absorption spectrometry techniques. A good linearity (R 2 = 0. 9937) was obtained in the range of 5 to 4000 μg L- 1 demonstrating the suitability of the DLLME + TXRF for both the analysis of drinking and waste water samples.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a portable near infrared spectrophotometer to determine biodiesel content in diesel/biodiesel blends, {{as well as to}} quantify adulteration by vegetable oil, was evaluated. The NIR transmittance/absorbance spectra of 118 samples in the range 950 - 1650 nm were acquired using an ultra-compact spectrophotometer (MicroNIR), and also by using a Fourier transform <b>benchtop</b> <b>instrument</b> (FT-NIR) from 800 to 2500 nm. In a preliminary step, partial least squares (PLS) models aimed at the determination of biodiesel quality parameters were developed by using full spectral information. Thereafter, the variables showing significant regression coefficients were selected and the PLS models were re-processed. Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA) was used to screen for the most orthogonal variables to be used in a model constructed by using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). For determining the contents of both biodiesel and vegetable oil in diesel/biodiesel blends, using MicroNIR and FT-NIR, the results indicated MLR-SPA as the best modelling strategy. RMSEP values of 0. 22 % v/v (MicroNIR) and 0. 13 % v/v (FT-NIR) for biodiesel and 0. 34 % v/v (MicroNIR) and 0. 22 % (FT-NIR) for vegetable oil contents were obtained. LOD values of 0. 31 % (MicroNIR) and 0. 22 % (FT-NIR) for biodiesel and 0. 40 % (MicroNIR) and 0. 34 % (FT-NIR) for vegetable oil determination were achieved. The results revealed comparable performances between the portable and the benchtop instruments, demonstrating the feasibility of monitoring in situ the quality characteristics of diesel/biodiesel blends according to biodiesel content and for detection of adulteration with vegetable oils by using the portable spectrophotometer.

We assessed the lysis efficiency of a very small disposable bead blender called OmniLyse relative to the industry standard benchtop Biospec Mini-BeadBeater. The OmniLyse weighs approximately 3 g, at a size of approximately 1. 1 cm 3 without the battery pack. Both instruments were used to mechanically lyse Bacillus subtilis spores and Mycobacterium bovis BCG cells. The relative lysis efficiency was assessed through real-time PCR. Cycle threshold (CT) values obtained at all microbial cell concentrations were similar between the two devices, indicating that the lysis efficiencies of the OmniLyse and the BioSpec Mini-BeadBeater were comparable. As an internal control, genomic DNA from a different organism was spiked at a constant concentration into each sample upstream of lysis. The CT values for PCR amplification of lysed samples using primers specific to this internal control were comparable between the two devices, indicating negligible PCR inhibition or other secondary effects.

These organic species are key markers for life, having {{the property of}} chirality {{that can be used}} to distinguish biological from non-biological amino acids. One of the critical components in the <b>benchtop</b> <b>instrument</b> is liquid chromatography (LC) analytical column. The commercial LC analytical column is an over- 250 -mm-long and 4. 6 -mm-diameter stainless steel tube filled with functionized microbeads as stationary phase to separate the molecular species based on their chemistry. Miniaturization of this technique for spaceflight is compelling for future payloads for landed missions targeting astrobiology objectives. A commercial liquid chromatography analytical column consists of an inert cylindrical tube filled with a stationary phase, i. e., microbeads, that has been functionalized with a targeted chemistry. When analyte is sent through the column by a pressurized carrier fluid (typically a methanol/ water mixture), compounds are separated in time due to differences in chemical interactions with the stationary phase. Different species of analyte molecules will interact more strongly with the column chemistry, and will therefore take longer to traverse the column. In this way, the column will separate molecular species based on their chemistry. A lab-on-chip liquid analysis tool was developed. The microfluidic analytical column is capable of chromatographically separating biologically relevant classes of molecules based on their chemistry. For this analytical column, fabrication, low leak rate, and stationary phase incorporation of a serpentine microchannel were demonstrated that mimic the dimensions of a commercial LC column within a 5 10 1 mm chip. The microchannel in the chip has a 75 - micrometer-diameter oval-shaped cross section. The serpentine microchannel has four different lengths: 40, 60, 80, and 100 mm.

As a common feature all involved gene products {{are found in the}} primary cilia or associated organelles. In respect to the diagnosis of the different entities, their clinical and genetic overlap hampers a distinct clinical diagnosis. Therefore an efficient molecular genetic algorithm to identify the underlying gene defects is of high practical relevance in the clinical daily routine. Knowing the genetic cause has implications for therapeutic management of the patients and opens up the possibility of prenatal diagnosis. To assess the gene specific and overall detection rates for the so far known involved disease genes the clinical and molecular genetic data of the literature were reviewed. Additionally the data of 215 collected patients of the Institute of Human Genetics RWTH Aachen were ascertained and evaluated, as a first step to develop a diagnostic algorithm. The current development of high throughput and high resolution molecular genetic methods offers new possibilities to analyze the involved genes. Therefore the use of SNP arrays in consanguineous families and of <b>benchtop</b> <b>instrument</b> based next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches was tested in a subset of DNA samples to improve a Sanger sequencing based gene by gene analysis. A comprehensive diagnostic algorithm including the NGS and array observations is presented. Furthermore as part of this work the clinical and genetic data of the patients were evaluated to uncover new genotype phenotype correlations. Quantitative conclusions regarding the frequency of the single entities in relation to the molecular genetic findings are hardly possible because of the rareness of the particular observations. However, it can be concluded from the own studies that the spectrum of genes involved in the so called Meckel-like phenotype has to be extended to BBS 1 and BBS 12.

40|$|Cirrus {{are thin}} upper tropospheric clouds that are {{composed}} entirely of ice particles. Due to their extensive {{coverage of the}} Earth’s surface, they {{have a significant impact}} on the Earth’s radiative balance. In the absence of a foreign surface, cirrus ice particles can form via homogeneous ice nucleation in liquid aqueous solution aerosol droplets. Ice can also nucleate heterogeneously when catalysed by the presence of solid particles, which can affect the physical properties of the cloud, potentially resulting in high in-cloud humidity and low optical depth. In order to better quantify the impact of cirrus on future climate it is vital to understand the microphysical processes that lead to their formation. This project focuses on the investigation of heterogeneous ice nucleation in the deposition mode under cirrus conditions. It can be divided into two sections: 1) The investigation of the ice nucleation behaviour of glassy aerosols. Atmospheric secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is likely to exist in a semi-solid or glassy state, particularly at low temperatures and humidities. Over the course of two experimental campaigns at the AIDA (Aerosol Interactions and Dynamics in the Atmosphere) cloud simulation chamber, the ice nucleation properties of aerosols of five different glass forming compositions (citric acid, raffinose, 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxy-mandelic acid (HMMA), levoglucosan, and a mixture – raffinose/M 5 AS) were studied. These organic compounds have similar functionality to oxidised organic material found in atmospheric aerosol and have estimated temperature/humidity induced glass transition thresholds that fall within the range predicted for atmospheric SOA. A small fraction of aerosol particles of all compositions were found to nucleate ice heterogeneously in the deposition mode at temperatures < 200 K, which is relevant to the tropical tropopause layer (TTL). Raffinose and HMMA, which form glasses at higher temperatures, nucleated ice heterogeneously at temperatures as high as 214. 6 and 218. 5 K respectively. Using a 1 D cirrus model, it was shown that nucleation on glassy aerosols may explain low ice crystal numbers and high in-cloud humidity in the TTL. It was also found that the ice nucleation efficiency of glassy aerosol particles became enhanced after having been frozen homogeneously at temperatures close to their glass transition thresholds. 2) The design and development of a <b>benchtop</b> <b>instrument</b> for the study of deposition mode ice nucleation. After characterisation, the deposition mode chamber was used to investigate ice nucleation by a natural sample of kaolinite clay mineral dust (KGa- 1 b, Clay Minerals Society). The surface area of kaolinite present was found to affect the onset humidity of ice nucleation. Evidence was also found for the enhancement of kaolinite particles as ice nuclei after they had nucleated ice in an initial experiment...|$|E

40|$|Signal {{amplification}} by reversible exchange (SABRE) is a hyperpolarisation {{technique that}} catalytically transfers nuclear polarisation from parahydrogen, the singlet nuclear isomer of H 2, to a substrate in solution. The SABRE exchange reaction {{is carried out}} in a polarisation transfer field (PTF) of tens of gauss before transfer to a stronger magnetic field for NMR detection. In the simplest implementation, polarisation transfer is achieved by shaking the sample in the stray field of a superconducting NMR magnet. While convenient, this method suffers from limited reproducibility and cannot be used with NMR spectrometers {{that do not have}} appreciable stray fields, such as <b>benchtop</b> <b>instruments.</b> Here we use a simple hand-held permanent magnet array to provide the necessary PTF during sample shaking. We find that the use of this array provides a 25 % increase in SABRE enhancement over the stray field approach, while also providing improved reproducibility. Arrays with a range of PTFs were tested and the PTF-dependent SABRE enhancements were found to be in excellent agreement with comparable experiments carried out using an automated flow system where an electromagnet is used to generate the PTF. We anticipate that this approach will improve the efficiency and reproducibility of SABRE experiments carried out using manual shaking and will be particularly useful for benchtop NMR, where a suitable stray field is not readily accessible. The ability to construct arrays with a range of PTFs will also enable the rapid optimisation of SABRE enhancement as function of PTF for new substrate and catalyst systems...|$|R

Several techniques suitable for on-site analysis, which integrate sampling and sample preparation in one step, have demonstrated high versatility and throughput in field applications. This research was focused on the application and evaluation of three microextraction techniques: solid phase microextraction (SPME), needle trap devices (NTD) and membrane extraction with sorbent interface (MESI), which were then coupled with various portable instruments for on-site analysis of different systems. Additionally, the conducted project involved the development of an approach using ion mobility spectrometry detection (IMS) coupled with a miniaturized gas chromatograph (GC) as a powerful system for field analysis. This proposed GC-IMS exhibited satisfactory performance in terms of retention time (inter-day variation < 3 %) and response stability (intra and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) < 10 %). Moreover, when coupled with NTD, it showed limits of detection comparable to those provided by conventional <b>benchtop</b> <b>instruments.</b> Other portable GC instruments employed in this project included flame ionization and mass spectrometry detection.

A Raman spectroscopy instrument was selected for inclusion on the ExoMars mission because of its ability to assess the habitability and to search for evidence of life on Mars. Indeed Raman spectrometers have the capability to detect geological substances which are inorganic molecules and inorganic molecular ions constituting the rocky surface of Mars. Information on the nature of rocks present on the surface of Mars will provide information about the habitability of the planet. Besides the detection of geomarkers, Raman spectrometers have the ability to detecting potential biological-derivative substances, often referred to as biomarkers. These biomarkers are organic molecules originating from extent or extinct living organisms. In preparation for ExoMars, it is crucial to study the detection capability of miniaturized Raman spectrometers (specifically developed for space missions and therefore compromised by the associated challenging constraints such as minimal power budget, mass budget, data budget and overall envelope) on both lab synthetic samples and natural terrestrial analogues samples. We present here a systematic comparison of the capability of a number of Raman spectrometer designs/configurations to detect biomarkers in geological matrices that are relevant to the Martian surface and subsurface.

Finally, recent trends and challenges toward on-CMOS sensor integration that could enable highly miniaturized electrochemical biosensor microsystems are discussed. The information in the paper can guide next generation electrochemical sensor design...|$|R
40|$|The {{advance in}} {{microfluidics}} and microfabrication enables the miniaturization {{of the conventional}} biochemical reactions to achieve inexpensive and rapid assays. In this dissertation, biochemical reaction microsystems in two-phase microfluidic formats – air-liquid and liquid-liquid (droplet-based), were developed and studied to perform single- and multi-step amplification-based DNA analyses. Microfluidic valveless devices for single-liquid-phase-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were developed to reduce the evaporation loss relying {{on the principle of}} diffusion-limited evaporation. The evaporation can be suppressed using long narrow diffusion channels in conjunction with reducing the driving force for liquid evaporation by decreasing the interfacial temperature using thermal isolation and reducing the vapor concentration gradient through replenishing water vapor in the diffusion channels. With these techniques the evaporation loss can be limited to approximately 1 % of the reaction content. Performance of droplet-based PCR was also studied in a microdevice. Droplets with a volume range of 5 - 250 nL can be formed on-chip reproducibly, and PCR in the droplets showed amplification efficiency comparable to benchtop reactions with no evaporation loss. Reaction parameters such as reagent concentration, hold time at each cycling step, template concentration and the droplet size were characterized. The droplet-based PCR also demonstrated amplification with a cycle threshold of ~ 10 cycles earlier than the <b>benchtop</b> <b>instruments.</b> Operation of the droplet-based microdevice was then automated using on-chip electronic sensing. The sensing signal was used to track the oil/aqueous interface and control the pneumatic supply for automatically generating and moving droplets. The actual droplet size was very close to the designed value with a standard deviation less than 3 % of the droplet size. The droplets can be automatically confined in the reaction region with feedback pneumatic control. PCR has also been successfully performed in the automated generated and positioned droplets. Droplet manipulations such as merging and mixing were also studied in a microdevice for applications in multi-step bioreactions. Mixing in the merged droplets was achieved with the droplet kept in the chamber or moved out of the chamber. A droplet-based two-step bioreaction, nested TaqMan® PCR with enhanced sensitivity has been demonstrated by utilizing droplet generation, merging and mixing in the microdevice...|$|R
40|$|Microarrays {{containing}} 195, 000 in situ synthesized oligonucleotide features {{have been}} created using a <b>benchtop,</b> maskless photolithographic <b>instrument.</b> This instrument, the Maskless Array Synthesizer (MAS), uses a digital light processor (DLP) developed by Texas Instruments. The DLP creates the patterns of UV light used in the light-directed synthesis of oligonucleotides. This digital mask {{eliminates the need for}} expensive and time-consuming chromium masks. In this report, we describe experiments in which we tested this maskless technology for DNA synthesis on glass surfaces. Parameters examined included deprotection rates, repetitive yields, and oligonucleotide length. Custom gene expression arrays were manufactured and hybridized to Drosophila melanogaster and mouse samples. Quantitative PCR was used to validate the gene expression data from the mouse arrays...|$|R
40|$|Most {{analytical}} methods in metabolomics {{are based on}} one of two strategies. The first strategy is aimed at specifically analysing {{a limited number of}} known metabolites or compound classes. Alternatively, an unbiased approach can be used for profiling as many features as possible in a given metabolome without prior knowledge of the identity of these features. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry with instruments capable of measuring m/z ratios with sufficiently low mass measurement uncertainties and simultaneous high scan speeds, it is possible to combine these two strategies, allowing unbiased profiling of biological samples and targeted analysis of specific compounds at the same time without compromises. Such high mass accuracy and mass resolving power reduces the number of candidate metabolites occupying the same retention time and m/z ratio space to a minimum. In this study, we demonstrate how targeted analysis of phospholipids as well as unbiased profiling is achievable using a <b>benchtop</b> orbitrap <b>instrument</b> after high-speed reversed-phase chromatography. The ability to apply both strategies in one experiment is an important step forward in comprehensive analysis of the metabolome. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dideoxy-based chain {{termination}} sequencing {{developed by}} Sanger is {{the gold standard}} sequencing approach and allows clinical diagnostics of disorders with relatively low genetic heterogeneity. Recently, new next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have {{found their way into}} diagnostic laboratories, enabling the sequencing of large targeted gene panels or exomes. The development of <b>benchtop</b> NGS <b>instruments</b> now allows the analysis of single genes or small gene panels, making these platforms increasingly competitive with Sanger sequencing. METHODS: We developed a generic automated ion semiconductor sequencing work flow {{that can be used in}} a clinical setting and can serve as a substitute for Sanger sequencing. Standard amplicon-based enrichment remained identical to PCR for Sanger sequencing. A novel postenrichment pooling strategy was developed, limiting the number of library preparations and reducing sequencing costs up to 70 % compared to Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 1224 known pathogenic variants were analyzed, yielding an analytical sensitivity of 99. 92 % and specificity of 99. 99 %. In a second experiment, a total of 100 patient-derived DNA samples were analyzed using a blind analysis. The results showed an analytical sensitivity of 99. 60 % and specificity of 99. 98 %, comparable to Sanger sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: Ion semiconductor sequencing can be a first choice mutation scanning technique, independent of the genes analyzed...|$|R
40|$|The GELFREE 8100 Fractionation System {{is a novel}} protein {{fractionation}} {{system designed}} to maximize protein recovery during molecular weight based fractionation. The system is comprised of single-use, 8 -sample capacity cartridges and a <b>benchtop</b> GELFREE Fractionation <b>Instrument.</b> During separation, a constant voltage is applied between the anode and cathode reservoirs, and each protein mixture is electrophoretically driven from a loading chamber into a specially designed gel column gel. Proteins are concentrated into a tight band in a stacking gel, and separated based on their respective electrophoretic mobilities in a resolving gel. As proteins elute from the column, they are trapped and concentrated in liquid phase in the collection chamber, free of the gel. The instrument is then paused at specific time intervals, and fractions are collected using a pipette. This process is repeated until all desired fractions have been collected. If fewer than 8 samples are run on a cartridge, any unused chambers {{can be used in}} subsequent separations...|$|R
40|$|The orbitrap mass {{analyzer}} combines high sensitivity, high resolution, {{and high}} mass accuracy in a compact format. In proteomics applications, {{it is used}} in a hybrid configuration with a linear ion trap (LTQ-Orbitrap) where the linear trap quadrupole (LTQ) accumulates, isolates, and fragments peptide ions. Alternatively, isolated ions can be fragmented by higher energy collisional dissociation. A recently introduced stand-alone orbitrap analyzer (Exactive) also features a higher energy collisional dissociation cell but cannot isolate ions. Here we report that this instrument can efficiently characterize protein mixtures by alternating MS and “all-ion fragmentation” (AIF) MS/MS scans {{in a manner similar}} to that previously described for quadrupole time-of-flight instruments. We applied the peak recognition algorithms of the MaxQuant software at both the precursor and product ion levels. Assignment of fragment ions to co-eluting precursor ions was facilitated by high resolution (100, 000 at m/z 200) and high mass accuracy. For efficient fragmentation of different mass precursors, we implemented a stepped collision energy procedure with cumulative MS readout. AIF on the Exactive identified 45 of 48 proteins in an equimolar protein standard mixture and all of them when using a small database. The technique also identified proteins with more than 100 -fold abundance differences in a high dynamic range standard. When applied to protein identification in gel slices, AIF unambiguously characterized an immunoprecipitated protein that was barely visible by Coomassie staining and quantified it relative to contaminating proteins. AIF on a <b>benchtop</b> orbitrap <b>instrument</b> is therefore an attractive technology for a wide range of proteomics analyses...|$|R
40|$|Three <b>benchtop</b> {{high-throughput}} sequencing <b>instruments</b> are now available. The 454 GS Junior (Roche), MiSeq (Illumina) and Ion Torrent PGM (Life Technologies) are laser-printer sized {{and offer}} modest set-up and running costs. Each instrument can generate data {{required for a}} draft bacterial genome sequence in days, making them attractive for identifying and characterizing pathogens in the clinical setting. We compared the performance of these instruments by sequencing an isolate of Escherichia coli O 104 :H 4, which caused an outbreak of food poisoning in Germany in 2011. The MiSeq had the highest throughput per run (1. 6 Gb/run, 60 Mb/h) and lowest error rates. The 454 GS Junior generated the longest reads (up to 600 bases) and most contiguous assemblies but had the lowest throughput (70 Mb/run, 9 Mb/h). Run in 100 -bp mode, the Ion Torrent PGM had the highest throughput (80 – 100 Mb/h). Unlike the MiSeq, the Ion Torrent PGM and 454 GS Junior both produced homopolymer-associated indel errors (1. 5 and 0. 38 errors per 100 bases, respectively) ...|$|R
40|$|The painter, Vincent van Gogh, {{and some}} of his contemporaries {{frequently}} made use of the pigment chrome yellow that is known to show a tendency toward darkening. This pigment may correspond to various chemical compounds such as PbCrO(4) and PbCr(1 -x) S(x) O(4), that may each be present in various crystallographic forms with different tendencies toward degradation. Investigations by X-ray diffraction (XRD), mid-Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR), and Raman <b>instruments</b> (<b>benchtop</b> and portable) and synchrotron radiation-based micro-XRD and X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy performed on oil-paint models, prepared with in-house synthesized PbCrO(4) and PbCr(1 -x) S(x) O(4), permitted us to characterize the spectroscopic features of the various forms. On the basis of these results, an extended study has been carried out on historic paint tubes and on embedded paint microsamples taken from yellow-orange/pale yellow areas of 12 Van Gogh paintings, demonstrating that Van Gogh effectively made use of different chrome yellow types. This conclusion was also confirmed by in situ mid-FTIR investigations on Van Gogh's Portrait of Gauguin (Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam) ...|$|R
