5|$|The MCC team which toured Australia in 1907‚Äî08, {{like that}} which toured South Africa, faced {{questions}} about its strength. <b>Because</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> four first-choice players {{chose not to}} tour, and another was not selected despite strong claims, the team was less representative than usual for an Ashes series. The tourists lost the Tests 4‚Äì1, although Wisden suggested that the series was more competitive than suggested by the results.|$|E
5|$|Britain's {{enemies in}} {{continental}} Europe had long recognised Ireland as a weak point in Britain's defences. Landing troops {{there was a}} popular strategic goal, not only because an invader could expect {{the support of a}} large proportion of the native population, but also <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> initially they would face fewer and less reliable troops than elsewhere in the British Isles. Additionally, embroiling the British Army in a protracted Irish campaign would reduce its availability for other theatres of war. Finally, French planners considered that a successful invasion of Ireland might act as the ideal platform for a subsequent invasion of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} wrestling business, Greenwald has made {{sporadic}} wrestling appearances, {{acts as a}} landlady with regards to her property holdings, invests in real estate, and performs charity work. On December 16, 2006, Nora went to Guatemala for several months to learn Spanish and do missions work. In addition, she took public speaking classes and earned a license in massage therapy. Greenwald now works for Minnesota Teen Challenge, a one-year residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. She joined the program <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> ten of her friends have died because of drug overdoses. Greenwald, a born again Christian, ministers to {{the women in the}} program. In January 2009, Greenwald participated in The Polar Bear Plunge, where she voluntarily submerged herself in freezing water {{to raise money for the}} Special Olympics Minnesota. She has also been a bus aide for special needs children and worked with recovering addicts at Teen Challenge.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of 1458 and 1459, Matthias held a Diet at Szeged {{to prepare for a}} war against the Ottoman Empire. However, gossip about a {{conspiracy}} compelled him to return to Buda. The rumours proved to be true <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 30 baronsincluding Ladislaus Garai, Nicholas √öjlaki, and Ladislaus Kanizsaimet in N√©met√∫jv√°r (now G√ºssing in Austria) and offered the throne to Emperor Frederick III on 17 February 1459. Although the joint troops of the Emperor and the rebellious lords defeated a royal army at K√∂rmend on 27 March, Garai had by that time died and √öjlaki soon entered into negotiations with Matthias' envoys. Skirmishes along the western borderlands lasted for several months, preventing Matthias from providing military assistance to Toma≈°eviƒá against the Ottomans. The latter took Smederevo on 29 June, completing the conquest of Serbia.|$|E
25|$|This result {{shows that}} it is {{possible}} to axiomatize ZFC with a single infinite axiom schema. <b>Because</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one such infinite schema is required (ZFC is not finitely axiomatizable), this shows that the axiom schema of replacement can stand as the only infinite axiom schema in ZFC if desired. Because the axiom schema of separation is not independent, it is sometimes omitted from contemporary statements of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms.|$|E
25|$|Aeta men are {{of great}} {{interest}} to genetic, anthropological and historical researchers <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 83% of them belong to haplogroup K2b, in the form of its rare primary clades K2b1* and P* (a.k.a. K2b2* or P-P295*). Most Aeta males (60%) carry K-P397 (K2b1), which is otherwise uncommon in the Philippines and is strongly associated with the indigenous peoples of Melanesia and Micronesia.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the real numbers, a (proper) subset of the surreal numbers {{does not have a}} least upper (or lower) bound unless it has a maximal (minimal) element. Conway defines a gap as {L | R}, L < R, L ‚à™ R = ùêçùê®; this is not a number <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one of the sides is a proper class. Gaps can also be thought of as the equivalent of Dedekind sections, and the Dedekind completion ùêçùê®ùïØ of the surreal numbers with the natural ordering is a (proper class-sized) linear continuum.|$|E
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> {{half the}} {{population}} of atoms must be excited from the ground state to obtain a population inversion, the laser medium must be very strongly pumped. This makes three-level lasers rather inefficient, despite being the first type of laser to be discovered (based on a ruby laser medium, by Theodore Maiman in 1960). A three-level system could also have a radiative transition between level 3 and 2, and a non-radiative transition between 2 and 1. In this case, the pumping requirements are weaker. In practice, most lasers are four-level lasers, described below.|$|E
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> two of {{the exits}} were blocked by the chutes used to bring the show's big cats {{in and out of}} the tent, people trying to escape could not bypass them. Some died from {{injuries}} sustained after leaping from the tops of the bleachers in hopes they could escape under the sides of the tent, though that method of escape ended up killing more than it saved. Others died after being trampled by other spectators, with some asphyxiating underneath the piles of people who fell over each other.|$|E

Also in March, White was charged and found guilty in General District Court of littering for throwing fliers out of his car. On May 14, White failed to appear at the sentencing hearing and left a note at his apartment that he will not be returning, violating his supervised release. He claimed online he was moving to Iran.|$|E
25|$|Staffing {{peaked in}} 1986 with 11.5 full time equivalents, and was {{subsequently}} reduced to 8.67. This includes staff spread over seven days, and reflects the high preponderance of part-timers {{typical of the}} industry. The decrease in staff occurred despite the onset of Sunday openings {{and the increase in}} door-count and issues <b>because,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> in part, amalgamation allowed the centralisation of many departments, such as cataloguing. The onset of computers has also increased efficiency, even to the near complete automation of some services, such as circulation through self-issue machines, which recorded 40% of items borrowed within their first months of installation at Birkenhead in 1995.|$|E
25|$|Iran and Syria {{are close}} {{strategic}} allies, and Iran has provided significant support for Syria in the Syrian Civil War. This {{is said to}} include technical support, some combat troops, and $9bn in financial support. Iran views the civil war as a critical front in an existential battle that directly relates to its geopolitical security. Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, was reported in September 2011 to be vocally {{in favor of the}} Syrian government. The Syrian city of Zabadani is vitally important to Assad and to Iran <b>because,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> as late as June 2011, the city served as the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps's logistical hub for supplying Hezbollah.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, inside a population, the {{presence}} of many different alleles ensures {{there will always be}} an individual with a specific MHC molecule able to load the correct peptide to recognize a specific microbe.

The variations in the MHC molecules (responsible for the polymorphism) are the result of the inheritance of different MHC molecules, and they are not induced by recombination, as it is the case for the antigen receptors.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{government}} and military institutions, {{a number of}} Canadian civilian organizations have association with the monarchy, either through their being founded via a Royal Charter (such as the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, the city of Saint John, New Brunswick, the Royal Kennebecasis Yacht Club, and McGill University), having been granted {{the right to use}} the prefix royal before their name (such as the Royal Quebec Golf Club and Royal Manitoba Winter Fair), or <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one member of the Royal Family serves as a patron.

25|$|During the Quaternary Period, {{the total}} volume of land ice, sea level, and global {{temperature}} has fluctuated initially on 41,000- and more recently on 100,000-year time scales, as evidenced most clearly by ice cores for the past 800,000 years and marine sediment cores for the earlier period. Over the past 740,000 years there have been eight glacial cycles. The entire Quaternary Period, starting 2.58 Ma, {{is referred to as}} an ice age <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one permanent large ice sheet‚Äîthe Antarctic ice sheet‚Äîhas existed continuously. There is uncertainty over how much of Greenland was covered by ice during the previous and earlier interglacials. During the colder episodes‚Äîreferred to as glacial periods‚Äîlarge ice sheets at least 4km thick at their maximum also existed in Europe, North America, and Siberia. The shorter and warmer intervals between glacials are referred to as interglacials.|$|E

In addition to The Prince's Charities Canada, established by Charles, Prince of Wales, some other charities and volunteer organizations have also been founded as gifts to, or in honour of, some of Canada's monarchs or members of the Royal Family, such as the Victorian Order of Nurses (a gift to Queen Victoria for her Diamond Jubilee in 1897), the Canadian Cancer Fund (set up in honour of King George V's Silver Jubilee in 1935), and the Queen Elizabeth II Fund to Aid in Research on the Diseases of Children. A number of awards in Canada are likewise issued in the name of previous or present members of the Royal Family. Further, organizations will give commemorative gifts to members of the Royal Family to mark a visit or other important occasion.|$|E
