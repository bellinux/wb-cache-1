500|$|The play {{ran for a}} month (and was Coward's {{first play}} seen in America), after which Coward {{returned}} to acting in works by other writers, starring as Ralph in The Knight of the Burning Pestle in Birmingham and then London. He did not enjoy the role, finding Francis Beaumont and his sometime collaborator John Fletcher [...] "two of the dullest Elizabethan writers ever known... I had a very, very long part, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very,</b> very bad at it". Nevertheless, The Manchester Guardian thought that Coward got {{the best out of}} the role, and The Times called the play [...] "the jolliest thing in London".|$|E

You cannot make a social-conscious picture in which {{you say that the}} intermediary between the hand and the brain is the heart. I mean, that's a fairy tale– definitely. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> interested in machines. Anyway, I didn't like the picture– thought it was silly and stupid– then, when I saw the astronauts: what else are they but part of a machine? It's very hard to talk about pictures—should I say now that I like Metropolis because something I have seen in my imagination comes true, when I detested it after it was finished? ...|$|E

She later described the difficult situation resulting {{from these two}} positions: [...] "They could have sacked me if they had wanted. I was a shop steward, but {{if they wanted to}} sack you they could still sack you. Instead, they would try and use me to stop the trouble. They would use me like a fire extinguisher, always there to stop trouble." [...] Ultimately, she wrote, [...] "I had a dual role in the factory, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> clear where my first loyalty lay. I was appointed a supervisor but I was elected to be a shop steward by my fellow workers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Journalist Martin Bashir {{interview}}ed Diana for the BBC {{current affairs}} show Panorama. [...] The interview was broadcast on 20 November 1995. In reference to {{her relationship with}} Hewitt, the Princess said to Bashir, [...] "Yes, I adored him. Yes, I {{was in love with}} him. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> let down [...]" [...] Referring to her husband's affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, she said, [...] "Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded." [...] Of herself, she said, [...] "I'd like to be a queen of people's hearts." [...] On the Prince's suitability for kingship, she stated, [...] "Because I know the character I would think that the top job, as I call it, would bring enormous limitations to him, and I don't know whether he could adapt to that." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 1, 2012, Nightwish {{announced}} via their Facebook {{page that}} they were parting ways with Olzon. According to the press statement, [...] "it has become increasingly obvious that the direction {{and the needs of}} the band were in conflict, and this has led to a division from which we cannot recover". This announcement came days after Olzon fell ill at a show in Denver, Colorado and was unable to perform. Nightwish used replacement singers from the opening band, Kamelot, and Olzon later expressed her disappointment, saying [...] "I was never asked if it was OK that they used Elize and Alissa in the show [...] night [...] I don't think it's a good decision they made and I'm sorry {{for those of you who}} came to see the whole band but got something else. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> ill and this decision wasn't mine." [...] According to the statement, Dutch singer Floor Jansen (ex-After Forever, ReVamp) would sing for the remainder of the Imaginaerum World Tour.|$|E

"This feeling led me {{into the}} excess of being very rude to that zealous and most {{charitable}} man, Mr. Spencer, {{when he came to}} Oxford in January, 1840, to get Anglicans to set about praying for Unity. I myself then, or soon after, drew up such prayers; {{it was one of the}} first thoughts which came upon me after my shock, but I was too much annoyed with the political action of the members of the Roman Church in England to wish to have anything to do with them personally. So glad in my heart was I to see him when he came to my rooms, whither Mr. Palmer of Magdalen brought him, that I could have laughed for joy; I think I did; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> rude to him, I would not meet him at dinner, and that, (though I did not say so,) because I considered him [...] " [...] in loco apostatx [...] " [...] from the Anglican Church, and I hereby beg his pardon for it." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{working with}} the pair, Almodóvar said: [...] "I battled a lot with the actresses' tears, against the {{physical}} need to cry. It is a very expressive battle. It wasn't out of reservedness, but because I didn't want tears, what I wanted was dejection – the thing that stays inside after {{years and years of}} pain. I adore melodrama, it's a noble genre, a truly great genre, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> clear that I didn't want anything epic, I wanted something else. Simply put, this had to be a very dry, tearless film". In an interview with the BBC, Almodóvar said there were comic situations in rehearsals, but he wanted to set the humour aside: [...] "I wanted something more intense; I wanted something cleaner to make sure the message got through". Almodóvar stated that he wanted to create something more austere and restrained than his previous films; he also reflected on the physical pain he had experienced in the past years which he believed to have inspired him to create a piece about solitude.|$|E
2500|$|Brando {{acknowledged}} {{his professional}} decline, writing later, [...] "Some {{of the films}} I made during the sixties were successful; some weren't. Some, like The Night of the Following Day, I made only for the money; others, like Candy, I did because a friend asked me to and I didn't want to turn him down... In some ways I think of my middle age as the Fuck You Years." [...] Candy was especially appalling for many; a 1968 sex farce film directed by Christian Marquand {{and based on the}} 1958 novel by Terry Southern, the movie satirizes pornographic stories through the adventures of its naive heroine, Candy, played by Ewa Aulin. It is generally regarded as the nadir of Brando's career. The Washington Post observed: [...] "Brando's self-indulgence over a dozen years is costing him and his public his talents." [...] In the March 1966 issue of The Atlantic, Pauline Kael wrote that in his rebellious days, Brando [...] "was antisocial because he knew society was crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap", but now Brando and others like him had become [...] "buffoons, shamelessly, pathetically mocking their public reputations." [...] In an earlier review of The Appaloosa in 1966, Kael wrote that the actor was [...] "trapped in another dog of a movie... Not for the first time, Mr. Brando gives us a heavy-lidded, adenoidally openmouthed caricature of the inarticulate, stalwart loner." [...] Although he feigned indifference, Brando was hurt by the critical mauling, admitting in the 2015 film Listen to Me Marlon, [...] "They can hit you every day and you have no way of fighting back. I was very convincing in my pose of indifference, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> sensitive and it hurt a lot." ...|$|E
