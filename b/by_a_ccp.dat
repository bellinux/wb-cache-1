That being said, CCPs significantly lack practical experience with advanced skills such as IV initiation, peripheral access to cardiovascular system for fluid and drug administration, advanced airway, and many other techniques. Where an PCP and ACP may run 40-50 medical codes per year a CCP may run 1-2 in an entire career. IV/IO starts are nearly non-existent in the field and for this reason CCPs are required to attend nearly double the amount of time in classroom situations or in hospital to keep current. In addition to this they are trained for other skills such as medication infusion pumps, mechanical ventilation and arterial line monitoring.13CCPs often work in fixed and rotary wing aircraft when the weather permits and staff are available, but systems such as the Toronto EMS Critical Care Transport Program work in land ambulances. ORNGE Transport operates both land and aircraft in Ontario.

40|$|We {{study the}} role of a central {{counterparty}} (CCP) in controlling counterparty risk. When trading is organized via a centralized exchange with fungible contracts [...] as in a futures market [...] we show that it is optimal to clear trades via a CCP that uses (i) novation to pool the risk of default and (ii) mutualization of losses to insure against the aggregate cost of default in the form of price risk. We then analyze the design of CCP clearing for over-the-counter (OTC) trades where contracts are customized and, hence, not fungible. A CCP can still offer gains from novation by pooling default risk across all customized contracts. Bargaining in OTC trades leads to an inefficient allocation of default risk across trades. A transfer scheme can alleviate this inefficiency, but necessitates novation being offered <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>CCP.</b> Hence, the benefit from CCP clearing for OTC markets goes beyond simple netting as it is a prerequisite for an efficient allocation of default risk in such markets.

40|$|Novating {{a single}} asset class to <b>a</b> central {{counterparty}} (<b>CCP)</b> in <b>an</b> over-the-counter derivatives trading network impacts both {{the mean and}} variance of total net exposures between counterparties. When {{a small number of}} dealers trade in a relatively large number of asset classes, central clearing increases the mean and variance of net exposures, which may lead to increased counterparty risk and higher margin needs. There are intermediate cases where there is a tradeoff: The introduction of <b>a</b> <b>CCP</b> leads to <b>an</b> increase in expected net exposures but this increase is accompanied <b>by</b> <b>a</b> reduction in variance.

40|$|An uncollateralized swap hedged {{back-to-back}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>CCP</b> swap is used {{to introduce}} FVA. The open IR 01 of FVA, however, is {{a sure sign of}} risk not being fully hedged, a theoretical no-arbitrage pricing concern, and a bait to lure market risk capital, a practical business concern. By dynamically trading the CCP swap, with the liability-side counterparty provides counterparty exposure hedge and swap funding, we find that the uncollateralized swap can be fully replicated, leaving out no IR 01 leakage. The fair value of the swap is obtained by applying to swap's net cash flows a discount rate switching to counterparty's bond curve if the swap is a local asset or one's own curve if a liability, and the total valuation adjustment is the present value of cost of funding the risk-free price discounted at the same switching rate. FVA is redefined as a liquidity or funding basis component of total valuation adjustment, coherent with CVA, the default risk component. A Longstaff-Schwartz style least-square regression and simulation is introduced to compute the recursive fair value and adjustments. A separately developed finite difference scheme {{is used to}} test and find regression necessary to decouple the discount rate switch. Preliminary results show the impact of counterparty risk to swap hedge ratios, swap bid/ask spreads, and valuation adjustments, and considerable errors of calculating CVA by discounting cash flow or potential future exposure.

This perception may be translated to current and future CO 2 storage projects, as this relatively new application has a limited track record at scale. To better understand unexpected fluid migration and responses, the CO 2 Capture Project Phase 3 (CCP 3) has developed the “CO 2 Storage Contingencies” project. The project was initiated <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>CCP</b> 3 -sponsored workshop that brought together industry, national laboratory and academic experts in wells, reservoir engineering and geosciences. The goal was to systematically assess CO 2 and displaced fluid migration scenarios with current versus needed capabilities for detection, intervention and remediation of damages. Three focus areas were addressed in detail: wells, conformance and seals/fractures. It was concluded that groundwater and vadose zone remediation strategies would be deferred owing to decades of related experience and that a focus on intervention might obviate their need. The underlying assumption of the workshop was that even if CO 2 storage projects employ state-of-the-art site characterization, risk assessment, and monitoring systems, unexpected migration may nevertheless occur, particularly during the early stages of gaining experience with large scale deployment. Specific mechanisms for unanticipated CO 2 and brine migration were identified with both established and novel mitigation approaches for remedying them proposed. The group concurred on a general approach to qualifying scenarios with potential mitigations. A forward plan was outlined to document relevant industry experience with a roadmap of needed research and development (R&D), including modelling, simulation, bench-scale experiments and field trial design through deployment. The initial phases of the study are ongoing with concurrent concept development of the latter phases entailing identification, assessment and possible deployment of a field trial of detection and intervention approaches...|$|E

40|$|The global crisis {{triggered}} a vast programme of financial markets reform, {{including a new}} regime for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives which requires hitherto private contracts to be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs). This article argues that the interaction between underlying law and this new regulation {{needs to be addressed}} in order to advance the objectives of the reforms. The starting point for the argument is the two techniques that underpin CCPs: limited access and posting assets, or margin. Having established that access via intermediated or ‘client’ clearing will become increasingly important with mandatory clearing, the article explores the impact of client clearing on the legal rules governing the margin posted <b>by</b> users of <b>a</b> <b>CCP.</b> The detail of the interaction between European regulations on CCP clearing and the UK rules on client assets is considered as an example. The dilemma identified arises because regulation, designed to improve financial stability by mandating clearing, may potentially undermine certain ways in which CCPs promote that outcome. The article concludes that the interaction between underlying law and new regulation needs to be accounted for and addressed at EU level, in order to safeguard the functions that attracted regulators to clearing in the first place...|$|R

Default funds {{play a crucial}} role as a risk mitigant in this framework.

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of central {{clearing}} of over-the-counter (OTC) transactions on counterparty exposures in a market with OTC transactions across several asset classes with heterogeneous characteristics. The impact of introducing <b>a</b> central counterparty (<b>CCP)</b> on expected interdealer exposure {{is determined by the}} tradeoff between multilateral netting across dealers on one hand and bilateral netting across asset classes on the other hand. We find this tradeoff to be sensitive to assumptions on heterogeneity of asset classes in terms of `riskyness' of the asset class as well as correlation of exposures across asset classes. In particular, while an analysis assuming independent, homogeneous exposures suggests that central clearing is efficient only if one has an unrealistically high number of participants, the opposite conclusion is reached if differences in riskyness and correlation across asset classes are realistically taken into account. We argue that empirically plausible specifications of model parameters lead to the conclusion that central clearing does reduce interdealer exposures: the gain from multilateral netting in <b>a</b> <b>CCP</b> overweighs the loss of netting across asset classes in bilateral netting agreements. When <b>a</b> <b>CCP</b> exists for interest rate derivatives, adding <b>a</b> <b>CCP</b> for credit derivatives is shown to decrease overall exposures.

40|$|A {{clearing}} member of <b>a</b> Central Counterparty (<b>CCP)</b> {{is exposed to}} losses on their default fund and initial margin contributions. Such losses can be incurred whenever the CCP has insufficient funds to unwind the portfolio of a defaulting {{clearing member}}. This does not necessarily require the default of the CCP itself. In this note we aim to quantify the risk a financial institution has when facing <b>a</b> <b>CCP.</b> We show that <b>a</b> clearing member’s <b>CCP</b> risk is given <b>by</b> <b>a</b> sum of exposures {{to each of the}} other clearing members. This arises because of the implicit default insurance that each member has provided in the form of mutualised, loss sharing collateral. We calculate the exposures by explicitly modeling the capital structure of <b>a</b> <b>CCP</b> as well as the loss distributions of the individual member portfolios. An important consideration in designing the model is the limited transparency with respect to the portfolio composition and collateral levels of individual clearing members. To overcome this we leverage the fact that, for <b>a</b> typical <b>CCP,</b> margin levels are risk-based. In particular, we parameterise the portfolio loss tail as a Pareto distribution and we calibrate this to the CCP defined probability of losses exceeding the posted initial margin levels. A key aspect of the model is that we explicitly take into account wrong-way risk, i. e. the fact that member defaults are more likely to occur in stressed market conditions, as well as potential contagion between a member’s default and the losses on his portfolio.
