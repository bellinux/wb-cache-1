50|$|The northeastern part of Turkey {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of Caucasian {{whortleberry}} (V. arctostaphylos), bilberry (V. myrtillus) and bog blueberry, <b>bog</b> <b>whortleberry</b> or bog bilberry (V. uliginosum). This region from Artvin to Kırklareli, as well as parts of Bursa (including Rize, Trabzon, Ordu, Giresun, Samsun, Sinop, Kastamonu, Zonguldak, İstanbul, İzmit and Adapazari) have rainy, humid growing periods and naturally acidic soils suitable for blueberries (Çelik, 2005, 2006 and 2007).|$|E
40|$|Pollination {{ecology of}} three Vaccinium species {{considered}} primarily adapted to bumblebees (Bombus LATR. spp.) was {{studied in the}} High Ardennes, Belgium. Observations and insect collections were conducted in a peaty heath during the period 1988 - 1990, in the bilberry (V. myrtillus), the cowberry (V. vitis-idaea) and the <b>bog</b> <b>whortleberry</b> (V. uliginosum). Nine bumblebee species were caught on Vaccinium, 95 % of these individuals were queens. They frequently visit the Vaccinium species, especially V. myrtillus. V. vitis-idaea attracted primarily honeybees but was also visited, likewise, V. uliginosum, by a diverse pollinator assemblage (with syrphids, solitary bees, bumblebees) ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{is a great}} {{diversity}} of plant life in the areas around Todd Lake. [...] The conifer forest that surrounds the lake is dominated by mountain hemlock, lodgepole pine, and various fir species. [...] Ground cover in the shaded parts of the forest includes <b>bog</b> huckleberry, <b>whortleberry,</b> smooth woodrush, Brewer's mitrewort, and sidebells. [...] In open areas of the forest Jacob's ladder, alpine lake agoseris, and larkspur are common ground cover.|$|R
40|$|Transmission electromicroscopy, trypan blue {{staining}} {{in combination}} with stereomicroscope analysis and biochemical ergosterol assay were used to study the mycorrhizal symbionts in wild bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), <b>bog</b> <b>whortleberry</b> (Vaccinium uliginosum) and highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) roots. TEM-analysis showed that in all species ericoid mycorrhizas formed hyphae coil inside the epidermal root cells. In stereomicroscopic viewing the highest mycorrhizal colonisation was observed in the roots of wild bilberries (51 %), whereas according to the ergosterol assay the highest total fungal biomass of roots was found in bog whortleberries (209 mg g- 1 of root d. wt). Both ergosterol and microscopical method showed that the mycorrhizal associations in blueberry cultivars and their wild relatives growing on natural soil medium are frequent, although ericoid mycorrhiza formation of highbush blueberries was somewhat weaker than that of wild bilberries and bog whortleberries...|$|E
40|$|A Western {{lifestyle}} {{with low}} {{physical activity and}} a diet rich in sugar, fat and processed food contribute to higher incidences of diabetes and obesity. Enhanced glucose uptake in human liver cells was observed after treatment with phenolic extracts from different Nordic berries. All berry extracts showed higher inhibition against α-amylase and α-glucosidase than the anti-diabetic agent acarbose. Total phenolic content and phenolic profiles in addition to antioxidant activities, were also investigated. The berries were extracted with 80 % methanol on an accelerated solvent extraction system (ASE) and then purified by C- 18 solid phase extraction (SPE). Among the ASE methanol extracts, black chokeberry, crowberry and elderberry extracts showed high stimulation of glucose uptake in HepG 2 cells and also considerable inhibitory effect towards carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes. SPE extracts with higher concentrations of phenolics, resulted in increased glucose uptake and enhanced inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase compared to the ASE extracts. Crowberry and cloudberry were the most potent 15 -lipoxygenase inhibitors, while <b>bog</b> <b>whortleberry</b> and lingonberry were the most active xanthine oxidase inhibitors. These results increase {{the value of these}} berries as a component of a healthy Nordic diet and have a potential benefit against diabetes...|$|E
