As a starting point for this project, the author worked on the island where she was born and raised: Ameland, The Netherlands. To experience the island from an outsider’s point of view, she also stayed for some time on Grímsey, North Iceland. The work that came forth from this period of experiencing and gathering information around islands, Iland / Us, consists of two sculptures that deal with <b>borders,</b> <b>protection,</b> self and community. Among the selected fragments are texts from literature and science, photos and sketches, alternated with personal island experience...|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Rubicon Resources was {{threatened}} by increased tariffs aimed at shrimp importers, {{in response to}} “dumping” allegations put forth by the United States Department of Commerce.

As a result, the Department of Commerce instructed the United States Customs and <b>Borders</b> <b>Protection</b> that the Rubicon Group would not be subject to higher tariffs.|$|R

The outer border of West Berlin, which was also the border between West-Berlin and the GDR, had also been closed down in 1952. During the night of 12 to 13 August 1961 the National People's Army, the German Border Police, the Volkspolizei and the Combat Groups of the Working Class locked down all passages between the Soviet sector and the three West sectors; construction of <b>border</b> <b>protection</b> facilities began.|$|E

5|$|The east–west interzonal border became {{steadily}} more tense as {{the relationship}} between the Western Allies and the Soviets deteriorated. From September 1947, an increasingly strict regime was imposed on the eastern Soviet zone boundary. The number of Soviet soldiers on the boundary was increased and supplemented with border guards from the newly established East German Volkspolizei ("People's Police"). Many unofficial crossing points were blocked with ditches and barricades. The West Germans also stepped up security with the establishment in 1952 of the Federal <b>Border</b> <b>Protection</b> force of 20,000 men– the Bundesgrenzschutz, or BGS; however, Allied troops (the British in the north, the Americans in the south) retained responsibility for the military security of the border.|$|E
5|$|The naval {{component}} of the F-FDTL was established in December 2001 when Portugal transferred two small Albatroz-class patrol boats from the Portuguese Navy.

The role of the naval component is to conduct fishery and <b>border</b> <b>protection</b> patrols and ensure that the maritime line of communication to the Oecussi enclave remains open. All of the force's warships are based at Hera Harbour, which is located a few kilometres east of Dili. Under the Force 2020 plan the naval component may eventually be expanded to a light patrol force equipped with corvette-sized ships and landing craft.|$|E
5000|$|... 1) When {{considering}} the current digital control system designs, the cyber security {{of these systems}} is dependent upon what is considered <b>border</b> <b>protections,</b> i.e., firewalls, passwords, etc. If a malicious actor compromised the digital control system for an industrial operation by a man-in-the-middle attack, data can be corrupted with the control system. The industrial facility operator would {{have no way of}} knowing the data has been compromised, until someone such as a security engineer recognized the attack was occurring. As operators are trained to provide a prompt, appropriate response to stabilize the industrial facility, there is a likelihood that the corrupt data would lead to the operator reacting to the situation and lead to a plant upset. In a resilient control system, as per Fig. 1, cyber and physical data is fused to recognize anomalous situations and warn the operator.|$|R

Main designated activities were operational, on the base of the analysis of agency´s mandate. Therefore, the main role of the agency is both coordination and assistant. The rule, that member states and their border forces are responsible for external <b>borders</b> <b>protection,</b> still applies.
