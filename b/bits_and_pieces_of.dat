Because they were playing around a preceding vamp or theme when Davis signaled the next, Tingen said the musical shifts heard on the record had the effect of post-production crossfades, similar to those used by producer Teo Macero on the studio recordings In a Silent Way (1969), Bitches Brew, and Jack Johnson. Macero claimed Davis conceived his onstage approach from him: [...] "It was because of me, because we always overlapped sections in our edits." ...|$|E

The ball was small sometimes, the ball was large sometimes, sometimes I saw the catcher, sometimes I didn't. Sometimes, I tried to stare the hitter down and throw while I was looking at him. I chewed my gum until it turned to powder. I started having a crazy idea in the fourth inning that Richard Nixon was the home plate umpire, and once I thought I was pitching a baseball to Jimi Hendrix, who to me was holding a guitar and swinging it over the plate. They say I had about three to four fielding chances. I remember diving {{out of the way of}} a ball I thought was a line drive. I jumped, but the ball wasn't hit hard and never reached me.|$|E
500|$|As the 1970s began, the New Left faded away, {{and many}} {{movements}} arose in its wake– {{among them the}} feminist, men's liberation, spiritual, human potential, ecology, appropriate technology, intentional community, and holistic health movements. [...] After graduating from the University of British Columbia in 1972, Satin immersed himself in all these movements, either directly or {{as a reporter for}} Canada's underground press. [...] He also took up residence in a free-love commune.

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Many reviews criticized the episode's {{lack of a}} cohesive plot. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a C rating, saying, Pool Party' was so loosely structured that it relied heavily on the characters to carry the narrative, {{and the result was}} some languid storytelling which gave me way too much time to think about missed opportunities, failed experiments, and the increasing burden of a show without any momentum." [...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote, [...] "There were <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> each story that worked in 'Pool Party,' but neither Robert's stroll through parties never had, nor Erin's endeavor to make Andy jealous, came together to make completely funny or interesting tales." [...] The Huffington Post wrote that, [...] "Once , the plot bits were so loose it might have been difficult for casual fans to follow it all." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, Pool Party' was one of those episodes where you can tell the writers didn't know what else to do.... This is filler, really, which unfortunately tends to be unavoidable when you do 22-episode seasons and you're eight years in." [...] Many reviews were critical of the continued Erin-Andy romance taking center-stage. McNutt wrote, [...] "I still really do not care about Andy and Erin as a relationship. The show's approach to this storyline... is to have Andy enjoying a fairly normal evening with his girlfriend Jessica while Erin acts like a crazy person {{in an effort to get}} his attention." [...] Forecella noted that, while the Erin and Dwight pairing was funny, their attempts to make Andy jealous were not successful, as Andy's sub-plots were deemed not funny and [...] "boring." ...|$|E

Invasive plant species are species that are able to survive, reproduce, spread unaided and sometimes at rapid rates across different landscapes. Invasive trees pose {{one of the most serious}} threats to nature conservation in the world. Invasive alien plants affect the capacity of ecosystems to deliver goods and services. Acacia mearnsii, an invasive plant in South Africa threatens native habitats by outcompeting indigenous vegetation for water, nitrogen and organic materials, replacing grass communities. Acacia mearnsii reduces native biodiversity and increases occurrence of water loss from riparian zones.
