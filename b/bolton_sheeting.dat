6000|$|Then {{people had}} arrived {{from all parts}} of the Bazaar. Luck, the ledger clerk, blundered against Polly and said, [...] "Help him!" [...] Somerville from the silks vaulted the counter, and seized a chair by the back. Polly lost his head. He clawed at the <b>Bolton</b> <b>sheeting</b> before him, and if he could have {{detached}} a piece he would certainly have hit somebody with it. As it was he simply upset the pile. It fell away from Polly, and he had an impression of somebody squeaking as it went down. It was the sort of impression one disregards. The collapse of the pile of goods just sufficed to end his subconscious efforts to get something to hit somebody with, and his whole attention focussed itself upon the struggle in the window. For a splendid instant Parsons towered up over the active backs that clustered about the shop window door, an active whirl of gesture, tearing things down and throwing them, and then he went under. There was an instant's furious struggle, a crash, a second crash and the crack of broken plate glass. Then a stillness and heavy breathing.|$|E
