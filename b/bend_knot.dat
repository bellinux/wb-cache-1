50|$|Ashley's <b>bend</b> is a <b>knot</b> used to {{securely}} {{join the}} ends of two ropes together. It is similar to several related <b>bend</b> <b>knots</b> which consist of two interlocking overhand knots, {{and in particular the}} alpine butterfly bend. These related bends differ by the way the two constituent overhand knots are interlocked.|$|R
50|$|Knots {{which have}} been called single carrick <b>bend</b> in various <b>knotting</b> books include the reef <b>knot,</b> the sheet <b>bend,</b> the granny <b>knot,</b> the thief knot, and even several {{arrangements}} that fail to form a knot at all, and simply fall apart.|$|R

50|$|The water knot (also tape <b>knot,</b> ring <b>bend,</b> grass <b>knot,</b> or {{overhand}} follow-through) is a knot {{frequently used}} in climbing for joining two ends of webbing together, for instance when making a sling.|$|R
50|$|More secure knots {{for this}} purpose are the Flemish <b>bend,</b> offset {{overhand}} <b>knot,</b> or double fisherman's knot.|$|R
5000|$|A {{properly}} tied butterfly bend {{should be}} as secure as the equivalent loop form. [...] However, subtle positioning errors during the above shown tying method {{can result in a}} similar looking but insecure <b>bend</b> <b>knot.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The triple fisherman's knot is a <b>bend</b> <b>knot,</b> used to join two ends of rope together. It is an {{extension}} of the double fisherman's knot and is recommended for tying slippery, stiff ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and aramid cored ropes.|$|E
5000|$|Despite being {{praised by}} some sources as a nearly ideal <b>bend</b> <b>knot,</b> {{it is not}} very well known; Clifford Ashley, author of The Ashley Book of Knots, was {{apparently}} unaware of this bend. Budworth (1998) names a similar-looking decorative knot the [...] "blimp knot".|$|E
50|$|The {{half hitch}} {{is a simple}} {{overhand}} knot, where the working end of a line is brought over and under the standing part. Insecure on its own, it is a valuable component {{of a wide variety}} of useful and reliable hitches, <b>bends,</b> and <b>knots.</b>|$|R
50|$|The fisherman's <b>knot</b> is a <b>bend</b> (a <b>knot</b> {{for joining}} two lines) with a {{symmetrical}} structure {{consisting of two}} overhand knots, each tied around the standing part of the other. Other names for the fisherman's knot include: angler's knot, English knot, halibut knot, waterman's knot.|$|R
50|$|Knots {{of ancient}} origin include the bottle sling, bowline, cat's paw, clove hitch, cow hitch, double fisherman's knot, eskimo bowline, figure-eight knot, fisherman's knot, half hitch, kalmyk loop, one-sided {{overhand}} <b>bend,</b> overhand <b>knot,</b> overhand loop, reef knot, running bowline, single hitch, thief knot, Turk's head knot, and two half-hitches.|$|R
50|$|The granny knot is {{a binding}} knot, used {{to secure a}} rope or line around an object. It is {{considered}} inferior to the reef knot (square knot), which it superficially resembles. Neither of these knots should {{be used as a}} <b>bend</b> <b>knot</b> for attaching two ropes together.|$|E
50|$|A Zeppelin bend (also Rosendahl bend) is a {{general-purpose}} <b>bend</b> <b>knot.</b> It is a secure, easily tied, and jam-resistant way {{to connect}} two ropes. Though its simplicity and security may be matched by other bends, it {{is unique in}} {{the ease with which}} it is untied, even after heavy loading by pulling the opposing bridges away from each other.|$|E
50|$|The award {{consists}} of a medal suspended from a blue ribbon; the ribbon is suspended from a silver colored bar bearing {{the design of a}} double carrick <b>bend</b> <b>knot.</b> The medal is a silver ship's wheel with a compass inscribed inside the wheel and bearing the Sea Scouting emblem consisting of the universal BSA insignia superimposed on an anchor.|$|E
50|$|The {{sheet bend}} (also known as becket <b>bend,</b> weaver's <b>knot</b> and weaver's hitch) is a bend, that is, a knot that joins two ropes together. Doubled, it is {{effective}} in binding lines of different diameter or rigidity securely together, although it {{has a tendency to}} work loose when not under load.|$|R
5000|$|The racking <b>bend</b> is a <b>knot</b> {{for joining}} two ropes of {{different}} diameter. [...] "Racking" [...] {{refers to the}} figure eight weaving that binds the bight of the larger rope together.|$|R
50|$|Hunter's bend (or rigger's <b>bend)</b> is a <b>knot</b> used to join two lines. It {{consists}} of interlocking overhand knots, and can jam under moderate strain. It is topologically {{similar to the}} Zeppelin bend.|$|R
50|$|The shroud knot is a {{multi-strand}} <b>bend</b> <b>knot</b> used to join two ends of laid (or twisted) rope together. Shroud knots, in general, are a {{class of}} knots {{in which the individual}} strands of laid rope are knotted, but not woven, to the individual strands of another laid rope. This makes them more secure than a simple bend but less secure than a full splice.|$|E
5000|$|The reef knot's familiarity, ease of tying, and {{visually}} appealing symmetry conceal its weakness. The International Guild of Knot Tyers warns that this knot {{should never be}} used to bend two ropes together. A proper <b>bend</b> <b>knot,</b> for instance a sheet bend or double fisherman's knot, should be used instead. Knotting authority Clifford Ashley claimed that misused reef knots have caused more deaths and injuries than all other knots combined. [...] Further, it is easily confused with the granny knot, {{which is a very}} poor knot.|$|E
50|$|Quartermaster is {{the highest}} rank {{attainable}} by a Sea Scout and is equivalent to Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America). The Sea Scout must attend at least three quarters of all Ship meetings and special activities over eighteen months, demonstrate marlinspike seamanship and leadership skills, demonstrate the ability to teach Sea Scouting skills, complete a Quartermaster Leadership Service Project (community service project) and pass a council level board of review. The Quartermaster emblem is a medal consisting of the Sea Scout emblem on a ship's wheel that is suspended from a solid dark blue ribbon that is in turn suspended from a bar bearing {{the design of a}} double carrick <b>bend</b> <b>knot.</b> In 2011, 40 Sea Scouts attained the rank of Quartermaster, compared with over 51000 Eagle Scouts.|$|E
5000|$|The carrick bend, {{also called}} full carrick <b>bend,</b> sailor's <b>knot,</b> and anchor <b>bend,</b> {{is perhaps the}} nearest {{thing we have to}} a perfect bend. It is symmetrical, it is easy to tie, it does not slip easily in wet material, it is among the strongest of knots, it cannot jam and is readily untied. To offset this array of excellencies is the sole {{objection}} that it is somewhat bulky. The Ashley Book of Knots ...|$|R
50|$|The {{basket weave}} knots are {{a family of}} <b>bend</b> and lanyard <b>knots</b> with a regular pattern of over-one, under-one. All of these knots are {{rectangular}} and lie in a plane. They are named after plait-woven baskets, which have a similar appearance.|$|R
50|$|The simple Simon under <b>bend</b> is a <b>knot</b> {{belonging}} to the category bend. It was invented by Harry Asher. It is more secure than the similar simple Simon over. The difference is just which of the green ends in the image below is the standing end.|$|R
5000|$|The figure-eight <b>bend</b> <b>knot</b> {{is used to}} [...] "splice" [...] {{together}} two ropes, not necessarily of equal diameter. This knot is tied starting with a loose figure-eight knot on one rope (the larger-diameter one if unequal), and threading of the other rope's running end through the first figure eight, starting at the first figure-eight's running end and paralleling {{the path of the}} first rope through the figure eight until the second's ropes running end lies parallel against first's standing end. The result is two figure-eight knots, each partly inside the other and tightening its hold on the other when they are pulled in opposite directions. This can be a permanent or temporary splice. While it precludes the ropes' slipping relative to each other, it is a typical knot in having less strength than the straight ropes.|$|E
40|$|Knot {{strength}} {{is very important}} in processing ropes than other textile products. Thus double sheet bends are usually used in rope mills, because their knots are small and strong in order to tie two threads of yarn. These knots have been made by manual operation. These mills, therefore, are demanding {{to be able to make}} these knots automatically in order to improve process efficiency. In this study, we have developed a knotter which is able to form a double sheet bend by using a set of molds. First, we designed a path to carve tracks on the surface of the mold by using the Dowker notation. But this path was too complicated to thread yarn through the path easily. Furthermore, it is desired that the knotter can be carried by a worker in rope mills. We, therefore, have moved and/or composed paths in order to obtain the simpler path for double sheet bends. Finally, we have integrated these molds and instruments such as air cylinders and linear guide ways in order to make a double sheet <b>bend</b> <b>knot</b> automatically. © 2008 The Textile Machinery Society of Japan...|$|E
5000|$|The double fisherman's knot or grapevine <b>knot</b> is a <b>bend,</b> or a <b>knot</b> used to join two {{lengths of}} rope. This knot and the triple fisherman's knot are the {{variations}} used {{most often in}} climbing, arboriculture, and search and rescue. The knot is formed by tying a double overhand knot, in its strangle knot form, with each end around the opposite line's standing part.|$|R
5000|$|The {{butterfly}} <b>bend</b> is a <b>knot</b> used to {{join the}} ends of two ropes together. It is the analogous bend form of the butterfly loop, {{in that it is}} the butterfly loop with the loop cut. [...] The observation that the butterfly loop is secure enough to isolate a worn or damaged section of rope within the loop indicated that the bend form of the knot would be similarly secure.|$|R
