50|$|This type of antenna {{is called}} a Hogg or {{horn-reflector}} antenna, invented by Alfred C. Beck and Harald T. Friis in 1941. It was built by David C. Hogg. It consists of a flaring metal horn with a curved reflecting surface mounted in its mouth, at a 45° angle to the long axis of the horn. The reflector is a segment of a parabolic reflector, so the antenna is really a parabolic antenna which is fed off-axis. A Hogg horn combines several characteristics useful for radio astronomy. It is extremely broad-band, has calculable aperture efficiency, and {{the walls of the}} horn shield it from radiation coming from angles outside the main beam axis. The <b>back</b> and <b>side</b> <b>lobes</b> are therefore so minimal that scarcely any thermal energy is received from the ground. Consequently, it is an ideal radio telescope for accurate measurements of low levels of weak background radiation. The antenna has a gain of about 43.3 dBi and a beamwidth of about 1.5° at 2.39 GHz and an aperture efficiency of 76%.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Capacity is one {{fundamental}} problem in wireless Ad hoc networks. Deploying directional antennas to wireless net-works can reduce interference among concurrent transmissions and increase spatial reuse, while {{the technology of}} multi-channel can separate concurrent transmissions. Therefore, combining these two technologies into one wireless network is capable of great improvement on the network capacity. Recent studies proposed a multi-channel network architecture that equips each wireless node with multiple directional antennas, which is called MC-MDA network. The capacity in MC-MDA network is derived under arbitrary and random placements. However, they only used a simplified directional antenna model. For approaching the more accurate capacity in real scenario, in this paper, we consider a hybrid antenna model, which takes the effect of <b>side</b> <b>lobe</b> and <b>back</b> lobe into account. We derive the capacity upper-bounds of MC-MDA networks in arbitrary and random network with the hybrid model to find the effect of <b>back</b> <b>lobe</b> and <b>side</b> <b>lobe.</b> We show that the network capacity {{is closely related to}} s the ratio of the radiuses of <b>side</b> <b>lobe</b> to main lobe. The capacity decreases when s increases. Moreover, we compare the network capacity of MC-MDA using the simplified antenna model with our results. When considering the factor of interference constraint, the capacity gain using the hybrid antenna model is√ θ 2 θ 2 +(4 π 2 −θ 2) s over the one with the simplified model.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the gain improvement of a sector antenna for mobile phone base station {{by using the}} new technique to enhance its gain for microstrip antenna (MSA) array without construction enlargement. The curved woodpile Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) has been utilized to improve the gain instead. The advantages of this proposed antenna are reducing the length of MSAs array but providing the higher gain and easy fabrication and installation. Moreover, it provides a fan-shaped radiation pattern, wide in the horizontal direction and relatively narrow in the vertical direction, which appropriate for mobile phone base station. The paper also {{presents the}} design procedures of a 1 x 8 MSAs array associated with U-shaped reflector for decreasing their <b>back</b> and <b>side</b> <b>lobes.</b> The fabricated curved woodpile EBG exhibits bandgap characteristics at 2. 1 GHz and is utilized for realizing a resonant cavity of MSAs array. This idea has been verified by both the Computer Simulation Technology (CST) software and experimental results. As the results, the fabricated proposed antenna achieves a high gain of 20. 3 dB and the half-power beam widths in the E- and H-plane of 36. 8 and 8. 7 degrees, respectively. Good qualitative agreement between measured and simulated results of the proposed antenna was obtained...|$|R

The level of minor lobes is usually expressed as a ratio of the power density in the lobe in question to that of the major lobe. This ratio is often termed the <b>side</b> <b>lobe</b> ratio or <b>side</b> <b>lobe</b> level. <b>Side</b> <b>lobe</b> levels of −20 dB or greater are usually not desirable in many applications. Attainment of a <b>side</b> <b>lobe</b> level smaller than −30 dB usually requires very careful design and construction.

Therefore, the single CIC filter has a large <b>side</b> <b>lobe</b> amplitude, which generally cannot meet the system requirements. In order to reduce <b>side</b> <b>lobe</b> attenuation, a multi-stage CIC filter cascade is used to aid the design; for each additional stage of the CIC filter, <b>side</b> <b>lobe</b> attenuation will be reduced by 13.46  dB. In this design, five CIC filter cascades make the first <b>side</b> <b>lobe</b> attenuation up to 67  dB, which can basically meet the system requirements [6, 7].|$|R

40|$|The major {{advantages}} of pulse compression are low pulse-power {{which makes it}} suitable for solid-state devices, higher maximum range, good range resolution and better jamming immunity. The matched filter is the optimal linear filter for maximizing the {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) in the presence of additive stochastic noise. Pulse compression is an example of matched filtering. But this matched filter output consists of unwanted but unavoidable <b>side</b> <b>lobes.</b> For multiple-target radar, the <b>side</b> <b>lobes</b> of the compressed pulse must be considered in the system design because of the likelihood of false alarms. At the receiver the signal processor uses weighting filters which are not matched to the transmitted waveform.
