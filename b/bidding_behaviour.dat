40|$|Online auction is {{a popular}} {{electronic}} marketplace that allows buyers and sellers to purchase and sell products in an efficient way. In spite of popularity of online auctions, there are many fraudulent <b>bidding</b> or selling <b>behaviours</b> that can occur during an auction (e. g., shill bidding, bid shielding, etc.).

The majority of popular research has focused on double auctions, i. e. auctions with multiple buyers and sellers. In this paper we investigate agent models of sealed bid auctions, i. e. single seller auctions where each buyer submits a single bid. We propose an adaptation of two learning mechanisms used in double auctions, Zero Intelligence Plus (ZIP) and Gjerstad-Dickhaut (GD), for sealed bid auctions. The experimental results determine if a single agent adopting ZIP & GD bidding mechanisms is able to learn the known optimal strategy through experience. We experiment with two types of sealed bid auctions, first price sealed bid and second price sealed bid. Quantitive analysis shows that whilst ZIP agents learn a good strategy they do not learn the optimal strategy, whereas GD agents learn an optimal strategy in first price auctions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{constructs}} an equilibrium {{model for}} the short-term money market, when the central bank provides liquidity via variable rate tenders. The relation between market rate of interest and liquidity is derived from a single bank’s profit maximisation problem in the interbank market, and the CB determines its liquidity provision by minimising a quadratic loss function that contains both deviations of expected market rate from CB target rate and differences between liquidity supply and target liquidity. We model equilibrium <b>bid</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the tenders and explain the underbidding phenomenon resulting from the minimum bid rate. We also show that, when maturities of consecutive operations overlap, the expected market interest rate will rise above the CB’s target whenever a target rate change (hike or cut) is expected {{to occur in the}} same reserve maintenance period.

Such a market aims to procure curtailment at a cost close to the marginal value of the electricity plus renewable subsidies and incentives, reducing risks for WPPs while minimising costs to the Independent System Operator (ISO). Through the use of game theory and market modelling, a key set of bidding strategies are identified that may evolve within such a market, which may act in opposition to the goals of the ISO. These are applied to a variety of network conditions in order to determine their likely impact and the resulting bidding signals provided to market participants. <b>Bidding</b> <b>behaviours</b> and market fluidity may also be affected by factors particular to wind power plants.

40|$|Online auctions {{have become}} an {{increasingly}} popular and convenient way for conducting ecommerce transactions on the Web. However, the rapid surge of users participating in online auctions has led to auction fraud. Among the types of auction fraud, the most prominent is Shill bidding. Shill bidding is intentionally fake bidding by a seller on his/her own auction to inflate the final price. This can be accomplished either by the seller himself/herself or by someone colluding with the seller to place fake bids on his/her behalf. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} manually investigate the large amount of auctions and bidders for shill bidding activities. Detecting shill bidding in real-time is {{the most effective way to}} reduce the loss result of the auction fraud. Researchers have proposed multiple approaches and experimented to control the losses incurred due to shill bidding. This paper investigates the real-time detection techniques of shill bidding. It also provides a brief overview of major work that has been conducted in shill bidding detection including both offline and real-time approaches. Furthermore, this paper identifies research gaps in the detection and prevention of shill <b>bidding</b> <b>behaviours.</b> It also provides future research issues and challenges to detect shill bidding in real-time.

Background While day-ahead offers and bids for energy should reflect participants’ expectations of real-time prices, prices between the two markets may nonetheless differ {{for a variety of}} reasons, including misestimations made by participants prior to discovering actual real-time conditions, risk averse offer and <b>bid</b> <b>behaviour,</b> varying supply and demand conditions between the markets, market power on the part of physical and/or virtual participants, and market design differences. In other words, day-ahead prices may be biased relative to real-time prices as a consequence of “contextual ” or circumstantial factors (such as the first three factors mentioned above), or {{may be the result of}} more systemic factors (such as the last two factors mentioned above). The Market Pricing Working Group has expressed concern with respect to: (a) Whether the proposed Ontario DAM design or RTM is biased relative to the other; and moreover (b) Whether any such bias would be systemic in nature; and (c) Whether any such systemic bias would generate and reinforce inefficient and unfair market outcomes and behaviours.

40|$|The {{real-time}} bidding (RTB), aka programmatic buying, {{has recently}} become {{the fastest growing}} area in online ad-vertising. Instead of bulking buying and inventory-centric buying, RTB mimics stock exchanges and utilises computer algorithms to automatically buy and sell ads in real-time; It uses per impression context and targets the ads to spe-cific people based on data about them, and hence dramat-ically increases the effectiveness of display advertising. In this paper, we provide an empirical analysis and measure-ment of a production ad exchange. Using the data sam-pled from both demand and supply side, we aim to provide first-hand insights into the emerging new impression selling infrastructure and its <b>bidding</b> <b>behaviours,</b> and help identi-fying research and design issues in such systems. From our study, we observed that periodic patterns occur in various statistics including impressions, clicks, bids, and conversion rates (both post-view and post-click), which suggest time-dependent models would be appropriate for capturing the repeated patterns in RTB. We also found that despite the claimed second price auction, the first price payment in fact is accounted for 55. 4 % of total cost due to {{the arrangement of the}} soft floor price. As such, we argue that the setting of soft floor price in the current RTB systems puts advertisers in a less favourable position. Furthermore, our analysis on the conversation rates shows that the current bidding strat-egy is far less optimal, indicating the significant needs for optimisation algorithms incorporating the facts such as the temporal behaviours, the frequency and recency of the ad displays, which have not been well considered in the past. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{opportunity}} cost {{of water in}} the irrigation industry is a contentious issue at present because of the commitment made by the State and Commonwealth governments to get water out of the irrigation industry for environmental flows. The estimated value of the {{opportunity cost}} will affect farmers' claims for compensation. Variation in the opportunity cost over space and the functioning of the spatial market will determine whether the efficiency costs of a simple across the board reduction in rights can be mitigated by trade or whether strategic buy back of water is required. The extent of variation in the opportunity cost of water according to seasonal conditions will affect the cost of flow policies that impact on the reliability of rights. To date, most economic advice on this opportunity cost of water has centred on gross margin analysis of the main irrigation uses of water and the compensation of these industries across space compared to the quantity of rights held. However, there has been a large volume of trade on temporary water markets in recent years and there is potential for using this data to better understand some of the characteristics of water demand and the market for water. This paper presents a preliminary analysis of market data from the last 5 years of trade on the Northern Victorian water exchange. The nature of <b>bidding</b> <b>behaviours</b> and spatial and temporal variations in water prices is illustrated, and the impact of water allocations and seasonal conditions on water prices is estimated.

40|$|Construction {{demand is}} a core {{component}} of the construction markets and affects contractors’ <b>bid</b> pricing <b>behaviour.</b> Through learning and adaptation, they continuously respond {{to changes in the}} level of construction demand as reflected by variations in their bids. Using an experimental research design, this research aims to investigate the effect of varying levels of construction demand on inexperienced bidders’ mark-up level and learning behaviour. Fifty-five inexperienced student bidders participated in the experiment. They were randomly assigned to two different demand scenarios: (i) a booming demand curve with a continually increasing number of projects available for bidding, and (ii) a recession demand curve with a continually decreasing number of projects available for bidding. The results show that the bidders’ mark-up level increases with the level of construction demand. They do learn and adapt rationally; whereas bidders with a higher current workload are, in general, more likely to submit higher bid prices, and vice versa. It is found that variations in their bids over time are statistically significant. The mark-up level for the booming group is significantly lower than the recession group, with the booming group having a higher bidding consistency. Linear mixed model analyses show that there is significant heterogeneity between individual bidders, indicating that each bidder behaved differently in response to varying levels of construction demand. Allowing for the heterogeneities, the significant factors affecting the bidders’ mark-up level are the number of projects available for bidding and current workload, whereas their learning behaviour is significantly affected by the time factor and bidding success rate. The implication of the findings for construction clients is that they should consider the construction demand level in their procurement strategies, in particular for scheduling the timing of their tenders. For contractors, {{a better understanding of how}} varying levels of construction demand affects their competitors will assist in the formulation of their bidding strategies.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to provide}} a comprehensive analysis of how British merchant banks organise and approach contested bids within the institutional framework of the City. To this end., a number of exploratory hypotheses were derived from a pilot study with five merchant banks in the City as well as discussions with the project supervisor. Interviews were the carried out with 30 leading UK merchant banks belonging to either the Accepting or Issuing houses associations regarding their role, organisational structure, approaches to bidding and defensive issues related to contested bids. The main perceptions and empirical findings from this major survey are then compared with results to analysis of 30 case studies spanning the 1979 - 81 period (supported by analysis of another 10 cases with respect to some issues) and the results are then discussed and analysed in chapters 8 and 9. To obtain an overview: of how self regulation prescribes <b>bid</b> <b>behaviour</b> and practices, interviews were also held with various City bodies. Volume 1 of this dissertation is divided into 5 parts. Part i outlines the research objectives, methodology and literature survey. Part II then examines the results of a survey of opinion of merchant bankers. In Part III, main results of the literature survey and merchant banking field work are compared with evidence derived. from the case studies. Important research findings pertaining to organisational structure of leading UK merchant banks, approaches to strategies and related issues are then identified and highlighted. Contemporary takeover issues which became apparent during this research project are then analysed and possible reforms suggested (Part IV). The final section i. e., Part V considers some for corporate advisory work relating to takeovers in the 1980 s. In the discussion, details of 40 case studies are used to illustrate the main trends. Volume 2, which is not to be generally available to readers gives a cross section of'transcripts of the interviews held with more than 90 merchant bankers, stockbrokers, takeover specialists, American investment bankers, merchant banking analysts, authors, foreign were chant bankers, officials of self-regulatory bodies as well as relevant financial and non-financial data of the merchant banks interviewed during this survey, Findings of this study are numerous and it has illustrated the fact that UK merchant banks approached their takeover assignments through team work with a minimum of 2, a favored norm of 3 and the maximum team size is dependent on the size, time factor and complexity of the transaction itself. Their approach to contested bids which are invariably multi-disciplinary and complicated should not be viewed purely from the financial perspective alone. In both bidding and defending capacities, the merchant subscribe to the hypotheses that while there are general financial and non-financial principles guiding their approaches,flexibility and creativity are essential. Although the bidder has more control over timing in the takeover Did, however, the findings of this survey have shown that in a number of cases, this factor [nay not always favour the buyer because of the emergence of rival bidders. *Moreover. timing is but one element of a bidding/offensive strategy. In essence, the defensive posture is necessarily a response appropriate to the offensive strategy. The share ownership structure of the defending company plays {{a crucial role in the}} final outcome of the bid. Generally, the merchant banks perceive that it is relatively easier to defend a client when the ownership is spread amongst the small investors who are thought to be more loyal to their boards. This is particularly important, for the main defensive thrust is often an appeal to shareholders' loyalty. This is but one aspect of defensive strategies for, although the literature of corporate finance tends to dwell on. only a few defensive strategies, this study finds that their range is wide. Another important finding was the fact that UK stockbrokers (as agents) work very closely with the merchant banks ('as principals) in advising on contested bids. The former are normally consulted for their market expertise. One of the leading stockbroking firms interviewed served 8 of the 17 ACH (Accepting Houses Committee) members. Owing to this special relationship between these two types of financial institutions and possibly their lack of financial power comparable to that of the merchant banks, the stockbrokers are generally constrained from acting as prinicpal advisors in takeover situations. However, with the impending structural changes in the stockbroking business in the mid 1980 s, there is a possibility that either the merchant bank or stockbroking firm assuming dual capacity. Finally, UK merchant banks in the 1980 s will be characterised by a trend towards conglomeracy and the development of fee-based international merchant banking activities especially in the USA and. the Asia/Pacific regions in view of the constriction and competition in domestic corporate financial advisory activities...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} issues of market design for emissions trading schemes by focusing on penalty designs and initial allocation mechanisms. Penalty design is {{defined in terms of}} penalty types and levels and the allocation mechanism compare free allocation with auctioning. The first essay employs a theoretical model to examine compliance incentives and market efficiency under three penalty types: the fixed-penalty rate (FPR), the make-good provision (MGP), and the mixed penalty design. Using a simple two-period model of firm&# 146;s profit maximisation, we analyse compliance decisions and the efficient penalty level under each penalty type. Our findings indicate that the penalty type does not affect compliance decisions provided that the efficient penalty level is applied. Market efficiency is retained regardless of penalty types. These findings are used as the hypotheses for the second essay. The behavioural implications of penalty designs on market performance are investigated in the second essay using an experimental method. Three penalty types and two penalty levels are enforced in a laboratory permit market with auctioning wherein subjects make compliance decisions by undertaking irreversible abatement investment decisions or by buying permits. In contrast to theory, we find that penalty levels serve as a focal point that indicates compliance costs and affects compliance strategies. The MGP penalty provides stronger compliance incentives than the other penalty types. Most importantly, a trade-off between investment incentives and efficiency is observed. Using a laboratory experiment, the third essay studies how the initial distribution of permits through free allocation or auctioning, may affect price discovery, allocative and static efficiency under the presence of three penalty designs. Price discovery is not influenced by the initial allocation mechanism. Permit prices remain above the efficient level due to the presence of irrational <b>bidding</b> and trading <b>behaviour</b> as well as risk aversion. Uncertainty regarding permit prices results in a modest allocative efficiency as over-investment prevails. Auctioning evidently generates higher static efficiency due to stronger price signals. This result supports the majority of literature which argues for auctioning. An appropriate auction design is crucial to avoid the risk of overbidding which will inflate the auction price and diminish efficiency...|$|R

However, overbidding in first-price auctions is significantly higher with outside options than without. First-price auctions yield more revenue than second-price auctions. This revenue-premium is significantly higher with outside options. In second-price auctions {{the introduction of}} outside options has only a small effect. ...|$|E

Since this information is generally not available, real data have to be substituted by predictions. In this paper we propose two alternative approaches to the problem and apply them to the hourly prediction of the aggregate supply function of the competitors of the main Italian generation company. ...|$|E
