5|$|Governments are {{particularly}} concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases {{that can affect}} domestic animals which may acquire them {{as a result of}} insufficient <b>biosecurity.</b> An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating flying foxes, their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. Avian flu H5N1 is present in wild bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include rabies, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and trichinosis.|$|E
5|$|Several {{conservation}} {{measures have been}} undertaken or proposed to protect this species. Inaccessible Island was once suggested as a site for agriculture for Tristan Islanders, which would have reduced habitat and risked the introduction of invasive species. However the island was declared a nature reserve by the Tristan da Cunha Island Council in 1994. Access to the island is restricted now, although Tristan Islanders are still permitted to visit the island to collect firewood and guano. Introduced New Zealand flax {{has been removed from}} the island, and the island now has a management plan. Other suggestions for securing this species' future include increased education on <b>biosecurity</b> for the local community, and potentially setting up a captive population. It has also been suggested that backup populations be established on other secure islands, for example Nightingale Island, in case predators reached Inaccessible Island, but this may have negative impacts on the endemic invertebrate faunas of these islands.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} maintains numerous facilities, research collaborations {{and academic}} programs devoted to agrodefense and biodefense.

25|$|Lugar, {{utilizing}} the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program (CTR) which helped former Soviet Union states dismantle {{weapons of mass}} destruction after the Cold War, worked with the country of Georgia on biosafety, <b>biosecurity</b> and biosurveillance efforts through CTR’s Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP). The main goal was to improve the biosafety, <b>biosecurity,</b> disease surveillance, and establish the Central Public Health Reference Laboratory.|$|E

25|$|When {{designing}} a facility, {{there are several}} things that {{should be kept in}} mind including <b>biosecurity,</b> worker safety and efficiency, and animal welfare. Diverse infrastructure is required in order to successfully collect and store genetic material. The buildings needed depend on the size of facilities as well as the extent of the operations.|$|E
25|$|Another major import {{are used}} cars, with {{approximately}} 166,000 landed per year. The cars are mainly relatively new Japanese models, {{due to the}} very strict technical requirements of the Japanese road authorities. Due to the very strict <b>biosecurity</b> regulations administered by the MAF, cars (and many other goods) have to pass through a decontamination facility, which strongly increases turnover times.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand <b>biosecurity</b> {{authorities}} {{announced that}} all imports of horses from Australia would be halted indefinitely, and all horses that had arrived since 1 August are being identified. The New Zealand TAB altered meeting times on Sunday 26 August {{to provide some}} racing for the Australian betting market and have temporarily suspended early betting on the Australian Spring racing carnival.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to numerous {{scientific and technical}} challenges, synthetic biology raises ethical issues and <b>biosecurity</b> issues. However, {{with the exception of}} regulating DNA synthesis companies, the issues are not seen as new because they were raised during the earlier recombinant DNA and genetically modified organism (GMO) debates and there were already extensive regulations of genetic engineering and pathogen research in place in the U.S.A., Europe {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantages}} of manure treatment are {{a reduction in}} the amount of manure that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced soil compaction. Nutrients are reduced as well, meaning that less cropland is needed for manure to be spread upon. Manure treatment can also reduce the risk of human health and <b>biosecurity</b> risks by reducing the amount of pathogens present in manure. Undiluted animal manure or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than domestic sewage, and can carry an intestinal parasite, Cryptosporidium, which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. Silage liquor (from fermented wet grass) is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high biological oxygen demand. With a low pH, silage liquor can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to storage equipment, and leading to accidental spillage. All of these advantages can be optimized by using the right manure management system on the right farm based on the resources that are available.|$|E
25|$|After Fouchier {{offered an}} article {{describing}} this {{work to the}} leading academic journal Science, the US National Science Advisory Board for <b>Biosecurity</b> (NSABB) recommended against publication of the full details of the study, and the one submitted to Nature by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin describing related work. However, after additional consultations at the World Health Organization and by the NSABB, the NSABB reversed its position and recommended publication of revised versions of the two papers. However, then the Dutch government declared {{that this type of}} manuscripts required Fouchier to apply for an export permit in the light of EU directive 428/2009 on dual use goods. After much controversy surrounding the publishing of his research, Fouchier complied (under formal protest) with Dutch government demands to obtain a special permit for submitting his manuscript, and his research appeared in a special issue of the journal Science devoted to H5N1. The papers by Fouchier and Kawaoka conclude that it is entirely possible that a natural chain of mutations could lead to an H5N1 virus acquiring the capability of airborne transmission between mammals, and that a H5N1 influenza pandemic would not be impossible.|$|E
500|$|It {{emerged in}} a highly {{critical}} report from Defra {{that there was a}} series of <b>biosecurity</b> failings at the Holton plant, some of which were drawn to the company's attention in the past. These included [...] "gulls were taking turkey waste to roosts on top of the turkey-house 500m away" [...] and [...] "holes in the turkey houses could have allowed in birds or rodents". Defra minister Jeff Rooker stated in a House of Lords debate on 22 February that the outbreak was [...] "exclusively a Bernard Matthews Holton problem".|$|E
500|$|Bernard Matthews {{had been}} {{importing}} 38tons of partly processed turkey meat {{on a weekly}} basis from their Saga Foods company, in Sárvár, Hungary, to a processing plant next to the farm. Though Saga Foods lies [...] from where the recent Hungarian H5N1 outbreak had occurred, a company director admitted it was [...] "possible" [...] that some of the meat could have come from the exclusion zone. In response to this revelation, Whitehall expressed concern over <b>biosecurity</b> and whether any meat may have been distributed for human consumption in Britain. On 9 February 2007 the Hungarian authorities started an investigation to try to establish whether there was a connection between the Suffolk and Hungarian outbreaks. On 11 February the investigation revealed that turkey products were still being transported, in both directions, between the plant and Hungary with EU regulations being cited as the reason why a transport ban could not be imposed.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Biosecurity,</b> a {{management}} measure {{used to prevent}} the transmission of diseases and disease agents on the facility, {{is important to keep}} in mind when designing a facility. In order to achieve a high level of <b>biosecurity,</b> collection facilities should be placed as far as possible from one another, as well as from farms. According to the FAO's recommendations, facilities should be [...] "at least 3 km from farms or other biological risks and 1 km from main roads and railways". Separation between collection facilities and surrounding farms can improve <b>biosecurity</b> as pests, such as flies and mice, have the potential to travel from farm to facility and vice versa. Other disease agents may be able to travel through the air via wind, furthering the importance of separation of farms and proper air sanitation and ventilation. Additionally, a perimeter fence is used to prevent potential threats that could cause contamination to germplasms, such as unauthorized personnel or unwanted animals, from entering the facilities. Animals may be housed in pens located inside or outside of a barn as long as they are contained within the perimeter fence. When interaction with outside objects, such as feed trucks or veterinary personnel, is necessary, complete sanitation is required to decrease the risk of contamination. There is always the possibility of disease spreading among the animals whose biological data is being collected or from animal to human. An example of a disease that can easily spread through germplasm is Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome, otherwise known as PRRS. A highly contagious disease between swine, PRRS causes millions of dollars to be lost annually by producers. The disease can be spread through boar semen. Therefore, <b>biosecurity</b> is particularly important when genetic material will be inserted into another animal to prevent the spread of such diseases.|$|E
2500|$|Quarantines (see <b>biosecurity</b> [...] )are one way {{in which}} {{prevention}} of the spread of invasive species can be regulated at the policy level. A quarantine is a legal instrument that restricts the movement of infested material from areas where an invasive species is present to areas in which it is absent.|$|E

The park has previously carried our vaccinations against avian influenza.|$|E
2500|$|The {{major issues}} facing {{agriculture}} in Australia are drought, water security, low soil fertility, weeds, climate change caused by global warming, <b>biosecurity</b> (biological threats from imported foods and livestock), tariffs on Australian exports in the importing country (particularly in Europe and Japan), subsidies to farmers {{in other countries}} (see Doha Development Round), currency fluctuations and price volatility.

2500|$|Regional {{authorities}} are {{primarily responsible for}} environmental management, including water, contaminant discharge and coastal management, river and lake management including flood and drainage control, regional land management; regional transport (including public transport) and harbours, <b>biosecurity</b> or pest management. Territorial {{authorities are}} responsible for local-level land use management (urban and rural planning); network utility services such as water, sewerage, stormwater and solid waste management; local roads; libraries; parks and reserves; and community development.

2500|$|Most of the <b>biosecurity</b> {{concerns}} in synthetic biology, however, {{are focused on}} the role of DNA synthesis and the risk of producing genetic material of lethal viruses (e.g. 1918 Spanish flu, polio) in the lab. Recently, the CRISPR/Cas system has emerged as a promising technique for gene editing. It was hailed by The Washington Post as [...] "the most important innovation in the synthetic biology space in nearly 30 years." [...] While other methods take months or years to edit gene sequences, CRISPR speeds that time up to weeks. However, due to its ease of use and accessibility, it has raised a number of ethical concerns, especially surrounding its use in the biohacking space.|$|E
2500|$|In {{many parts}} of the {{industrial}} world land clearing for agriculture has diminished and here the greatest threat to biodiversity, after climate change, has become the destructive effect of invasive species. [...] Increasingly efficient global transport has facilitated the spread of organisms across the planet. The potential danger of this aspect of globalization is starkly illustrated through the spread of human diseases like HIV AIDS, mad cow disease, bird flu and swine flu, but invasive plants and animals are also having a devastating impact on native biodiversity. Non-indigenous organisms can quickly occupy disturbed land and natural areas where, in the absence of their natural predators, they are able to thrive. At the global scale this issue is being addressed through the Global Invasive Species Information Network but there is improved international <b>biosecurity</b> legislation to minimise the transmission of pathogens and invasive organisms. Also, through CITES legislation there is control the trade in rare and threatened species. Increasingly at the local level public awareness programs are alerting communities, gardeners, the nursery industry, collectors, and the pet and aquarium industries, to the harmful effects of potentially invasive species.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2015, Heard and Depp {{breached}} Australia's strict <b>biosecurity</b> laws {{when they}} failed to declare their two Yorkshire Terriers to the Australian Customs Service when they flew by private jet into Queensland, where {{he was working on}} the fifth Pirates installment. Australian quarantine regulations, which are aimed at keeping rabies out of the country, require dogs from outside the country be quarantined a minimum of ten days. Heard was charged with two counts of illegally importing the dogs into the country and one count of producing a false document.

2500|$|Only {{about one}} quarter of the land is under {{cultivation}} – mainly in cereals. Barley, wheat and potatoes are grown in eastern parts of Scotland such as Aberdeenshire, Moray, Highland, Fife and the Scottish Borders. The Tayside and Angus area is a centre of production of soft fruits such as strawberries, raspberries and loganberries, owing to the mild climate. [...] Sheep raising is important in the less arable mountainous regions, such as the northwest of Scotland which are used for rough grazing, due to its geographical isolation, poor climate and acidic soils. Parts of the east of Scotland (areas such as Aberdeenshire, Fife and Angus) are major centres of cereal production and general cropping. In such areas, the land is generally flatter, coastal, and the climate less harsh, and more suited to cultivation. The south-west of Scotland – principally Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway – is a centre of dairying. Agriculture, especially cropping in Scotland, is highly mechanised and generally efficient. Farms tend to cover larger areas than their European counterparts. Hill farming is also prominent in the Southern Uplands in the south of Scotland, resulting in the production of wool, lamb and mutton. Cattle-Rearing particularly in the east and south of Scotland results in the production of large amounts of beef. Farming in Scotland was affected by BSE and the European ban on the importation of British beef from 1996. Dairy and Cattle farmers in south-west Scotland were affected by the 2001 UK Foot and Mouth outbreak, which resulted in the destruction of much of their livestock as part of the <b>biosecurity</b> effort to control the spread of the disease.|$|E
