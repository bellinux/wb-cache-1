2500|$|The {{adjustment}} of intonation {{is most often}} accomplished with a tuning slide that is a short slide between the neckpipe and the bell incorporating the <b>bell</b> <b>bow</b> (U-bend); this device was designed by the French maker François Riedlocker during the early 19th century and applied to French and British designs {{and later in the}} century to German and American models, though German trombones were built without tuning slides well into the 20th century. However, trombonists, unlike other instrumentalists, are not subject to the intonation issues resulting from valved or keyed instruments, since they can adjust intonation [...] "on the fly" [...] by subtly altering slide positions when necessary. For example, second position [...] "A" [...] is not in exactly the same place on the slide as second position [...] "E". Many types of trombone also include one or more rotary valves used to increase the length of the instrument (and therefore lower its pitch) by directing the air flow through additional tubing. This allows the instrument to reach notes that are otherwise not possible without the valve as well as play other notes in alternate positions.|$|E
50|$|Tuning slides came {{in during}} the very late 18th century. Early trombonists {{adjusted}} pitch with the slide, and by adding variously shaped and sized crooks. Modern reproductions often have a <b>bell</b> <b>bow</b> tuning slide or telescopic slide between the slide and bell sections. Crooks are still used, as are variously sized <b>bell</b> <b>bow</b> sections for larger changes.|$|E

50|$|From the glance of Kushmanda's right eye, {{a benevolent}} lady with {{complexion}} of milk was created. She had eight arms and three placid eyes. She was clad in white clothes {{and wore a}} crescent moon on her forehead. She was armed with trident, discus, small drum, arrow, conch shell, <b>bell,</b> <b>bow</b> and a ploughshare. Her face was glorious like the full moon and she wore pearl ornaments. She was seated on a gem-studded throne and maintained a serene smile. Kushmanda named her Saraswati.|$|E
50|$|In the 1940s, Hodges {{played a}} Conn 6M (recognizable by its {{underslung}} neck) {{and later on}} a Buescher 400 (recognizable by its V-shaped bell-brace) alto saxophone. By {{the end of his}} career in the late 1960s, Hodges was playing a Vito LeBlanc Rationale alto (serial number 2551A), an instrument which was notable for its unusual key-mechanisms (providing various alternative fingerings) and tone-hole placement, which gave superior intonation. Fewer than 2,000 were ever made. Hodges' Vito saxophone was silver-plated and extensively engraved on the <b>bell,</b> <b>bow,</b> body and key-cups of the instrument.|$|E
50|$|The more {{expensive}} cymbal pads can swing freely after being hit (only {{rotation of the}} pad is prevented by a special cymbal mount), so they feel more like real cymbals, while the less expensive cymbal pads are not movable and always stay in their fixed position, thus feeling less realistic. Most of the movable pads also feature a third bell zone, which is triggered when hitting the bell area of the cymbal pad. These cymbal pads are called three-way cymbals because of their three trigger zones (<b>bell,</b> <b>bow</b> and edge).|$|E

The series {{is composed of}} 14" [...] hi-hats, 20" [...] and 22" [...] rides, and a 22" [...] china cymbal. They are notable for the smaller <b>bell,</b> <b>bowed</b> profile, and paper thin edges.|$|R

50|$|Since World War II the {{contrabass}} trombone in F {{with two}} valve attachments has been primarily {{in use in}} orchestras, though the 18′ B version is still used by many. Originally due to reasons of limited space conditions in opera orchestra pits, the bell section was provided with a coil to reduce {{the length of the}} <b>bell</b> <b>bow,</b> but since the 1970s the long, straight form has taken precedence. Through the combination of both valves, the extension handle on the outer slide also became redundant and the instrument is provided with five or six working positions on the slide. Valve tuning combinations are E/B, D/B, or more rarely D/C.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the legend}} of Dick Whittington the <b>bow</b> <b>bells</b> could once be heard {{from as far away}} as the Highgate Archway (4.5 miles north). Many people assume that the <b>Bow</b> <b>Bells</b> are to be found in the {{district}} of Bow, rather than the lesser known St Mary-le-Bow church in Cheapside in the City of London. Thus while all East Enders are cockneys, not all cockneys are East Enders.|$|R

Josie Pye and Julia Bell did not [...] "speak" [...] for three months, because Josie Pye had told Bessie Wright that Julia <b>Bell's</b> <b>bow</b> when she got up to recite {{made her think of}} a chicken jerking its head, and Bessie told Julia. None of the Sloanes would have any dealings with the Bells, because the Bells had declared that the Sloanes had too much to do in the program, and the Sloanes had retorted that the Bells were not capable of doing the little they had to do properly. Finally, Charlie Sloane fought Moody Spurgeon MacPherson, because Moody Spurgeon had said that Anne Shirley put on airs about her recitations, and Moody Spurgeon was [...] "licked"; consequently Moody Spurgeon's sister, Ella May, would not [...] "speak" [...] to Anne Shirley {{all the rest of the}} winter.
