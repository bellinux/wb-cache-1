5|$|Gamma decay: {{this process}} {{results from a}} change in the energy level of the nucleus to a lower state, {{resulting}} in the emission of electromagnetic radiation. The excited state of a nucleus which results in gamma emission usually occurs following the emission of an alpha or a <b>beta</b> <b>particle.</b> Thus, gamma decay usually follows alpha or beta decay.|$|E
5|$|Fermi had {{the idea}} to resort to {{replacing}} the polonium-beryllium neutron source with a radon-beryllium one, which he created by filling a glass bulb with beryllium powder, evacuating the air, and then adding 50 mCi of radon gas, supplied by Giulio Cesare Trabacchi. This created a much stronger neutron source, the effectiveness of which declined with the 3.8-day half-life of radon. He knew that this source would also emit gamma rays, but, {{on the basis of}} his theory, he believed that this would not affect the results of the experiment. He started by bombarding platinum, an element with a high atomic number that was readily available, without success. He turned to aluminium, which emitted an alpha particle and produced sodium, which then decayed into magnesium by <b>beta</b> <b>particle</b> emission. He tried lead, without success, and then fluorine in the form of calcium fluoride, which emitted an alpha particle and produced nitrogen, decaying into oxygen by <b>beta</b> <b>particle</b> emission. In all, he induced radioactivity in 22 different elements. Fermi rapidly reported the discovery of neutron-induced radioactivity in the Italian journal La Ricerca Scientifica on 25 March 1934.|$|E
5|$|Other more rare {{types of}} {{radioactive}} decay include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of nucleons from a nucleus, {{or more than}} one <b>beta</b> <b>particle.</b> An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is internal conversion— a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays. A few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called spontaneous nuclear fission.|$|E

They {{are in the}} middle of the scale in terms of ionizing potential and penetrating power, being stopped by a few millimeters of plastic. This radiation is a small portion of the total emitted during radium 226 decay. Radium 228 emits <b>beta</b> <b>particles,</b> and is also a concern for human health through inhalation and ingestion. <b>Beta</b> <b>particles</b> are electrons or positrons and can travel farther than alpha particles in air.|$|R

5|$|If {{the mass}} of the nucleus {{following}} a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a gamma ray, or the kinetic energy of a <b>beta</b> <b>particle),</b> as described by Albert Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula, E=mc2, where m is the mass loss and c is the speed of light. This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.|$|E
5|$|Wu {{chose to}} do this by taking a sample of {{radioactive}} cobalt-60 and cooling it to cryogenic temperatures with liquid gases. Cobalt-60 is an isotope that decays by <b>beta</b> <b>particle</b> emission, and Wu was also an expert on beta decay. The extremely low temperatures were needed {{to reduce the amount}} of thermal vibration of the cobalt atoms to practically nil. Also, Wu needed to apply a constant and uniform magnetic field across the sample of cobalt-60 in order to cause the spin axes of the atomic nuclei to line up in the same direction. For this cryogenic work, she needed the facilities of the National Bureau of Standards and its expertise in working with liquid gases, and traveled to its headquarters in Maryland with her equipment to carry out the experiments.|$|E
25|$|Antineutrinos are {{produced}} in nuclear beta decay {{together with a}} <b>beta</b> <b>particle,</b> in which, e.g., a neutron decays into a proton, electron, and antineutrino. All antineutrinos observed thus far possess right-handed helicity (i.e. {{only one of the}} two possible spin states has ever been seen), while neutrinos are left-handed. Nevertheless, as neutrinos have mass, their helicity is frame-dependent, so it is the related frame-independent property of chirality that is relevant here.|$|E
50|$|<b>Beta</b> <b>particles</b> are high-energy, {{high-speed}} electrons or positrons {{emitted by}} {{certain types of}} radioactive nuclei, such as potassium-40. The production of <b>beta</b> <b>particles</b> is termed <b>beta</b> decay. They are designated by the Greek letter beta (β).There are two forms of beta decay, β− and β+, which respectively give rise to the electron and the positron.|$|R
50|$|Atomic {{batteries}} use radioisotopes {{that produce}} low energy <b>beta</b> <b>particles</b> or sometimes alpha particles of varying energies. Low energy <b>beta</b> <b>particles</b> {{are needed to}} prevent the production of high energy penetrating Bremsstrahlung radiation that would require heavy shielding. Radioisotopes such as tritium, nickel-63, promethium-147, and technetium-99 have been tested. Plutonium-238, curium-242, curium-244 and strontium-90 have been used.|$|R
2500|$|Some <b>beta</b> <b>particles</b> {{can also}} be {{detected}} by a thin-walled [...] "windowless" [...] G-M tube, which has no end window, but allows high energy <b>beta</b> <b>particles</b> {{to pass through the}} tube walls. Although the tube walls have a greater stopping power than a thin end window, they still allow these more energetic particles to reach the fill gas.|$|R
25|$|Instead {{of using}} the full {{equations}} in the style above, in many situations a compact notation is used to describe nuclear reactions. This style of the form A(b,c)D is equivalent to A + b producing c + D. Common light particles are often abbreviated in this shorthand, typically p for proton, n for neutron, d for deuteron, α representing an alpha particle or helium-4, β for <b>beta</b> <b>particle</b> or electron, γ for gamma photon, etc. The reaction above would be written as Li-6(d,α)α.|$|E
25|$|In {{electron}} and positron emission by {{beta decay}} the photon's energy {{comes from the}} electron-nucleon pair, with the spectrum of the bremsstrahlung decreasing continuously with increasing energy of the <b>beta</b> <b>particle.</b> In electron capture, the energy comes {{at the expense of}} the neutrino, and the spectrum is greatest at about one third of the normal neutrino energy, decreasing to zero electromagnetic energy at normal neutrino energy. Note that in the case of electron capture, bremsstrahlung is emitted even though no charged particle is emitted. Instead, the bremsstrahlung radiation may be thought of as being created as the captured electron is accelerated toward being absorbed. Such radiation may be at frequencies that are the same as soft gamma radiation, but it exhibits none of the sharp spectral lines of gamma decay, and thus is not technically gamma radiation.|$|E
25|$|In certain cases, {{the excited}} nuclear state {{that follows the}} {{emission}} of a <b>beta</b> <b>particle</b> or other type of excitation, may be more stable than average, and is termed a metastable excited state, if its decay takes (at least) 100 to 1000 times longer than the average 10−12 seconds. Such relatively long-lived excited nuclei are termed nuclear isomers, and their decays are termed isomeric transitions. Such nuclei have half-lifes that are more easily measurable, and rare nuclear isomers are {{able to stay in}} their excited state for minutes, hours, days, or occasionally far longer, before emitting a gamma ray. The process of isomeric transition is therefore similar to any gamma emission, but differs in that it involves the intermediate metastable excited state(s) of the nuclei. Metastable states are often characterized by high nuclear spin, requiring a change in spin of several units or more with gamma decay, instead of a single unit transition that occurs in only 10−12 seconds. The rate of gamma decay is also slowed when the energy of excitation of the nucleus is small.|$|E

50|$|Since primary {{electrons}} from {{internal conversion}} carry a fixed (large) {{part of the}} characteristic decay energy, they have a discrete energy spectrum, rather than the spread (continuous) spectrum characteristic of <b>beta</b> <b>particles.</b> Whereas the energy spectrum of <b>beta</b> <b>particles</b> plots as a broad hump, the energy spectrum of internally converted electrons plots as a single sharp peak (see example below).|$|R

500|$|The {{principal}} medicinal {{difference between}} astatine-211 and iodine-131 (a radioactive iodine isotope {{also used in}} medicine) is that iodine-131 emits high-energy beta particles, and astatine does not. Beta particles have much greater penetrating power through tissues than do the much heavier alpha particles. An average alpha particle released by astatine-211 can travel up to 70µm through surrounding tissues; an average-energy <b>beta</b> <b>particle</b> emitted by iodine-131 can travel nearly 30 times as far, to about 2mm. The short half-life and limited penetrating power of alpha radiation through tissues offers advantages in situations where the [...] "tumor burden is low and/or malignant cell populations are located {{in close proximity to}} essential normal tissues." [...] Significant morbidity in cell culture models of human cancers has been achieved with from one to ten astatine-211 atoms bound per cell.|$|E

500|$|A {{team led}} by Enrico Fermi in 1934 {{observed}} that bombarding uranium with neutrons produces the emission of beta rays (electrons or positrons from the elements produced; see <b>beta</b> <b>particle).</b> The fission products were at first mistaken for new elements with atomic numbers 93 and 94, which the Dean of the Faculty of Rome, Orso Mario Corbino, christened ausonium and hesperium, respectively. The experiments leading {{to the discovery of}} uranium's ability to fission (break apart) into lighter elements and release binding energy were conducted by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in Hahn's laboratory in Berlin. Lise Meitner and her nephew, the physicist Otto Robert Frisch, published the physical explanation in February 1939 and named the process [...] "nuclear fission". Soon after, Fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction. Confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939, and later work found that on average about 2.5 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium-235. Fermi urged Alfred O.C. Nier to separate uranium isotopes for determination of the fissile component, and on February 29, 1940, Nier used an instrument he built at the University of Minnesota to separate the world's first uranium-235 sample in the Tate Laboratory. After mailed to Columbia University's cyclotron, John Dunning confirmed the sample to be the isolated fissile material on March 1. Further work found that the far more common uranium-238 isotope can be transmuted into plutonium, which, like uranium-235, is also fissile by thermal neutrons. These discoveries led numerous countries to begin working on the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear power.|$|E
