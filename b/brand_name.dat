40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study {{conducted}} on the <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> of the 200 -top ranked Japanese rice wines in Japan {{in the year of}} 2016. The <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> are content analyzed using the same framework as was used for the Chinese <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> in the two studies by Chan & Huang (2001) and Chan & Huang (1997). With some modifications to fit the different orientation of this paper. The {{purpose of this study is}} to show the main semantic theme in <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> of sake, to give insight into the linguistic aspects of the <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> of sake, and to do several comparisons with previous studies that was conducted on Chinese <b>brand</b> <b>names.</b> The applied linguistic parameters are semantic context, semantic connotation, modifier-noun phrase, kanji character and syllable count. Alongside the results, there will be discussions to get a deeper understanding of Japanese <b>brand</b> <b>naming.</b> The results show that Japanese <b>brand</b> <b>naming</b> shares many of its linguistic aspects with Chinese <b>brand</b> <b>naming.</b> But it also revealed a difference in the syllable structure of the <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> of the two languages. Moreover, it showed that the most frequently occurring semantic theme of Japanese <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> is company names and personal names.

40|$|EEG {{coherence}} {{has been}} used extensively {{in the investigation of}} language processing of different words categories. In contrast, relatively less is known about EEG coherence pattern of processing <b>brand</b> <b>names.</b> The present study aimed to investigate EEG coherence pattern associated with <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> in English and Chinese. EEG coherence of 32 healthy normal participants during 4 reading conditions, including concrete English words, concrete Chinese characters, English <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> and their translated Chinese <b>brand</b> <b>names,</b> were computed and compared. Regardless whether it was in English or Chinese, <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> were generally associated with higher intrahemispheric beta coherence in both the left and right hemispheres than concrete words or characters. Compared to English <b>brand</b> <b>names,</b> Chinese <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> demonstrated increased interhemispheric theta coherence in the frontal and temporal cortical regions. These results suggest that <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> tend to be processed through semantic routes. Similar to proper names and nonwords, they are represented in the lexical systems of both hemispheres. In addition, English and Chinese <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> are processed similarly at the semantic level and the difference in EEG coherence patterns associated with English and Chinese <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> is more likely due to phonological and orthographic processing that are associated with English and Chinese, respectively.
