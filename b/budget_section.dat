50|$|A {{development}} director or director of {{development is the}} senior fundraising manager of a non-profit organization, company, or corporation. The position works closely with a chief financial officer (CFO) or treasurer. A Director of Development is chiefly responsible for bringing in revenue streams to a non-profit (grants, donations, special events), and a CFO {{is responsible for the}} fiscal management of the organization. A CFO is rarely assigned to write grant narratives, but may oversee the <b>budget</b> <b>section</b> of a grant application or a fiscal report for a grant. Some larger organizations (especially those that have large government grants) have a grants manager as well as a grant writer/Director of Development. A Grants Manager assists the CFO with grant reports and/or grant related accounting. A {{development director}} is usually remunerated for his or her work, and in best practices for nonprofit organizations, development directors earn salaries. Commissions are still considered unethical by professional organizations such as the Grant Professionals Association (GPA) and the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), but the practice of commission based remuneration is growing, particularly in the current economy.|$|E

This review summarizes the detected infrared spectroscopic ice features and compares the abundances across Galactic, extragalactic, and solar system environments. A tremendous amount of information is contained in the ice band profiles. Laboratory experiments {{play a critical role}} in the analysis of the observations. Strong evidence is found for distinct ice formation stages, separated by CO freeze out at high densities. The ice bands have proven to be excellent probes of the thermal history of their environment. The evidence for the long-held idea that processing of ices by energetic photons and cosmic rays produces complex molecules is weak. Recent state of the art observations show promise for much progress in this area with planned infrared facilities. Comment: To appear in Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, volume 53, 2015.

This problem will be addressed by: proposing a theological narrative (Story) as the alternative way of reading and studying Scripture. Section 1 will discuss the problem of how readers of Scripture can be helped to understand themselves within the larger narrative of the Story presented from Genesis to Revelation. Section 2 will discuss the problem of reading the text of Scripture in a fragmented way {{as a result of the}} Enlightenment 2 ̆ 7 s propensity toward propositional thinking aided by the addition of chapters and versus the 1500 s. In Section 3 we will show that the antidote to foundationalism 2 ̆ 7 s fragmented reading is story by reviewing some proposed solutions and one very real solution. Section 4 will offer a thesis that claims that the best way to understand Scripture is by grasping its metanarrative. As an antidote to reading fissiparously, Section 5 outlines a solution to the problem in a project in the form of a study guide which is a look at the Story presented in Scripture, ordered in Tom Wright 2 ̆ 7 s five-act play model with an addition of a prologue, which can be used as curriculum.

40|$|M. Ed. Section 34 (1) of the South African Schools Act No. 84 of 1996 (Government Gazette No. 17579, 1996 : 24) {{states that}} "the State must fund public schools from public revenue on an {{equitable}} basis {{in order to}} ensure the proper exercise of the rights of learners to education and the redress of past inequalities in education provision". Although the State has legislated its intentions of funding public schools, financial and budgetary constraints prevent it from meeting all the financial requirements of schools. Bearing this in mind, Section 36 of the same Act states that "a governing body of a public school must take all reasonable measures within its means to supplement the resources supplied by the State in order {{to improve the quality of}} education provided by the school to all learners at the school". Thus, schools - through their governing bodies, of which the principal is a member - are being encouraged to raise funds to supplement that which the State can provide. The State has qualified in terms of section 34 (2) of the same Act that "the State must, on an annual basis, provide sufficient information to public schools regarding the funding referred to in subsection (1) to enable public schools to prepare their budgets for the next financial year". In addition to this subsection which requires schools to draw up a <b>budget,</b> <b>Section</b> 38 (1) of the same Act stipulates that "a governing body of a public school must prepare a budget each year, according to guidelines determined by the Minister of the Executive Council, which shows the estimated income and expenditure of the school for the following financial year". Thus, budgets have become compulsory activities in the financial management functions of schools...|$|E
