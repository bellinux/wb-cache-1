25|$|In February 2014, Double Fine, and the Humble Bundle group began another charity drive titled Amnesia Fortnight 2014. During this drive, {{those that}} paid {{a minimum of}} $1 had the {{opportunity}} to vote on 29 concept ideas. In addition, those that paid more than the average will get to vote on a concept idea for a prototype led by Pendleton Ward, the creator of Adventure Time. After the completion of the voting period, Double Fine developed the top voted ideas into game prototypes that were available for those that purchased the bundle. As with Amnesia Fortnight 2012, 2 Player Productions filmed the production of the prototype, which was available to people who purchased the bundle, as well as on a Blu-ray, along with the prototypes on a DVD, for those who paid a minimum of $35. The four pitches that were made into prototypes for Amnesia Fortnight 2014 were Dear Leader, an emergent narrative game led by Anna Kipnis, Little Pink Best Buds, a game about little pink creatures who want to <b>be</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> led by Pendleton Ward, Mnemonic, a surreal, first-person noir adventure led by Derek Brand, and Steed, a game set in a storybook land full of inept heroes led by John Bernhelm. One idea, Bad Golf 2, was not selected as a prototype, but a group of Double Fine fans have started working on developing the title themselves, with the blessing of its conceptor, Patrick Hackett and permission of Double Fine.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Jones began deriding {{traditional}} Christianity as [...] "fly away religion", rejecting the Bible {{as being a}} tool to oppress women and non-whites, and denouncing a [...] "Sky God" [...] who was no God at all. Jones wrote a booklet titled [...] "The Letter Killeth", criticizing the King James Bible. Jones also began preaching {{that he was the}} reincarnation of Gandhi, Father Divine, Jesus, Gautama Buddha and Vladimir Lenin. Former Temple member Hue Fortson, Jr. quoted Jones as saying, [...] "What you need to believe in is what you can see... If you see me as your friend, I'll <b>be</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend.</b> As you see me as your father, I'll be your father, for those of you that don't have a father... If you see me as your savior, I'll be your savior. If you see me as your God, I'll be your God." ...|$|E

2500|$|Vanguard {{journalist}} Ochereome Nnanna wrote positively of the book, [...] "The simple impression I get is {{that the}} man is a very imaginative, straightforward, practical person; the ultimate Mr. Big Shot. He will <b>be</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> if you come to him with genuine friendship, but he will give you a fight of your life if you decide to fight. That is my kind of person." [...] Fashion designer Emilia Wickstead told the Financial Times the book inspired her at a young age to become an entrepreneur. Real Estate Weekly wrote, [...] "Think Big And Kick Ass is the title of one of Trump's books and the icon of everything Trump." [...] London Review of Books wrote that the work was a way to capitalize on the aspirations of consumers. The Washington Free Beacon rated the work's cover as the second best of all of Trump's book covers, and characterized the book as exemplifying [...] "The Trumpean Ideal".|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "End of Time" [...] is a {{declaration}} of co-dependence; Knowles professes her everlasting love to her romantic interest. As stated by Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic, [...] "At the start, she's stricken by her own emotional vulnerability; by the end, she's empowered by it." [...] The song opens with [...] "spitfire drums" [...] while Knowles sings in an almost distorted fashion, with her vocals layered underneath until a [...] "dramatic explosion". As her vocals continue to build up, Knowles airily chants: [...] "Come take my hand / I won’t let you go / I’ll <b>be</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> / I will love you so deeply / I {{will be the one}} to kiss you at night / I will love you till the end of time." [...] She continues her appeal as she sings to her love interest, [...] "Take you away from here / There's nothing between us but space and time". On the bridge, Knowles belts her vocal lines over a shooting horn sequence; with her multiple-layered vocals, she commands, [...] "Boy come to me", and towards the end, she repeatedly sings, [...] "Say you’ll never let me go". Knowles [...] "finds the strength in two" [...] as she affirms to her romantic interest, [...] "I just wanna be with you / I just wanna live for you / I'd never let you go!".|$|E
