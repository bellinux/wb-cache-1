40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to present, compare, and discuss the kinematic response of children and child anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) during emergency braking events in different restraint configurations in a passenger vehicle. Methods: A driving study was conducted on a closed-circuit test track comprising 16 children aged 4 to 12 years old and the Q 3, Hybrid III (HIII) 3 -year-old, 6 -year-old, and 10 -year-old ATDs restrained on the right rear seat of a modern passenger vehicle. The children were exposed to one braking event in each of the 2 restraint systems and the ATDs were exposed to 2 braking events in each restraint system. All events had a deceleration of 1. 0 g. Short children (stature 107 – 123 cm) and the Q 3, HIII 3 -year-old, and 6 -year-old were restrained on <b>booster</b> <b>cushions</b> as well as high-back booster seats. Tall children (stature 135 – 150 cm) and HIII 10 -year-old were restrained on <b>booster</b> <b>cushions</b> or restrained by 3 -point belts directly on the car seat. Vehicle data were collected and synchronized with video data. Forward trajectories for the forehead and external auditory canal (ear) were determined as well as head rotation and shoulder belt force. Results: A total of 40 trials were analyzed. Child volunteers had greater maximum forward displacement of the head and greater head rotation compared to the ATDs. The average maximum displacement for children ranged from 165 to 210 mm and 155 to 195 mm for the forehead and ear target, respectively. Corresponding values for the ATDs were 55 to 165 mm and 50 to 160 mm. The change in head angle was greater for short children than for tall children. Shoulder belt force was within the same range for short children when restrained on <b>booster</b> <b>cushions</b> or high-back <b>booster</b> seats. For tall children, the shoulder belt force was greater when restrained on <b>booster</b> <b>cushions</b> compared to being restrained by seat belts directly on the car seat. Conclusions: The forward displacement was within the same range for all children regardless of stature and restraint system. However, themaximum forward position depended on the initial seated posture and shoulder belt position on the shoulder. Differences could also be seen in the curvature of the neck and spine. Short children exhibited a greater flexion motion of the head, whereas a more upright posture at maximumforward position was exhibited by the tall children. The ATDs displayed less forward displacement compared to the children...|$|R

To better protect children in crashes preceded by emergency braking, this study a ims to quantify kinematics and seatbelt engagement during braking events. Eighteen rear‐seated children {{were exposed to}} braking events with 1 g deceleration in a passenger vehi cle, restrained by the seatbelt on a <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> and an integrated <b>booster</b> <b>cushion.</b> Vehicle acceleration and video data were analysed to m easure head displacement and shoulder belt position. On the <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> the belt was generally mid‐sho ulder and lower on the torso with a gap, while on the integrated <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> i t was closer to the neck and hi gher on the torso without a gap. Average forward head displacement was 160 mm on the <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> and 150 mm on the integrated <b>booster</b> <b>cushion.</b> Generally, the belt maintained the same position on the shoulde r throughout braking, with exceptions influenced by shifted initial positions or non‐standard motions. Braking e vents placed the head approximately 150 ‐ 190 mm forward from the initial position, influenced by booster, statu re, and initial seatbelt positioning. This reinforces the importance of maintaining mid‐shoulder or close to neck bel t positions and upright, centred postures prior to emergency braking, which may influence the likelihood of imp acting the vehicle interior and sustaining head injuries in a subsequent crash...|$|E
40|$|Head {{impact to}} the seat back has been {{identified}} as one important injury causation scenario for seat belt restrained, head-injured children and previous research highlighted vehicle maneuvers prior to impact as possible contributing factors. The aim was to quantify kinematics of child occupants during swerving maneuvers focusing on the child’s lateral movement and seat belt position relative to the child’s shoulder. A study was conducted on a closed-circuit test track with 16 children aged 4 - 12, restrained in the rear seat of a modern passenger vehicle. A professional driving instructor drove at 50 km/h making sharp turns in a repeatable fashion, resulting in inboard motion of the children. The children were exposed to two turns in each of two restraint systems. Shorter children were on a booster or highback <b>booster</b> <b>cushion.</b> The taller children were seated on a <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> or with only a lap and shoulder seat belt. Four film cameras were fixed in the vehicle monitoring the child. Vehicle data were also collected. The seat belt slipped off the shoulder in 1 of 5 turns, varying by age and restraint type. Among shorter children, the belt slipped off in a majority of turns when seated on a <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> while the belt remained on the shoulder when seated on the highback <b>booster</b> <b>cushion.</b> Among taller children, the shoulder belt moved far laterally on the shoulder in half of the turns.

40|$|Booster {{cushions}} {{are effective}} tools {{to protect children}} from injuries in car crashes, but there remains a large amount of misuse. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess potential misuse of booster cushions in an observational laboratory study, and to identify whether <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> design, age or clothing had any effect. 130 Swedish children from the ages of 4 - 12 years participated. Each child buckled up on an integrated and on an aftermarket <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> in the rear seat. The older children also buckled up with seat belt only. Interviews, observations and body measurements were performed. Time to buckle up and amount of belt slack were registered. Photographs were taken to document misuse. Results showed that 77 % failed to perform correct belt routing on the aftermarket cushion, independent of age, although they were familiar with this system. The misuse rate for the integrated cushion was only 4 %. No misuse was found for seat belt only. Few children tightened the belt. The belt slack increased when wearing winter jackets. This indicates the importance of adding pretensioners to the rear seat. Sled tests with HIII&TNO 6 y dummies were also performed for the most frequent misuse situations found. The main conclusion is that an integrated <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> has many advantages compared to an aftermarket cushion regarding both safety and comfort. It is easy and quick to handle, has few possibilities for misuse, has an intuitive design, the buckling up sequence is equal to buckling up with an ordinary seat belt, and younger children can buckle up correctly...|$|E
40|$|The risk {{of injury}} to child car {{occupants}} can be markedly reduced by their use of appropriate child restraints. These can be child seats with their own integral harness, child booster seats or <b>booster</b> <b>cushions</b> in association with adult seat belts or, {{if the child is}} old and large enough, by the use of adult seatbelts alone. However, the protection afforded can be negated if there is significant loading to the child and restraint through the car seat backrest. This paper describes analyses of accident data to demonstrate the occurrence of this effect in field accidents and presents the results of dynamic tests performed to explore the effect on different restraint types of limiting the load intrusion from the rear. Results of tests with child seats with integral harnesses show that head forward excursion is the main concern, the R 44 limits being impossible to meet if the seat back is allowed to move as far forward as the R-point. Where the child is restrained by the adult belt, belt forces in excess of the injury tolerance for adults were exceeded, raising to very high levels for backrest movement up to 150 mm ahead of the R-point...|$|R
40|$|Legislation in Europe {{requires}} {{children younger}} than 12 or shorter than 150 cm to use a child restraint system (CRS) when travelling in motor vehicles. These have decreased {{the number of children}} fatalities in car accidents, yet certain body regions such as the abdomen are still prone to severe trauma. One of the mechanisms by which injuries to this body region occur is called "submarining". It involves the seat-belt slipping over the pelvis onto the abdomen during rapid deceleration, therefore afflicting the abdomen with injurious loads. The motion characterising submarining with CRS is as of yet poorly defined, and although CRS are assessed for protection level, there is currently no established identification criteria for submarining. As part of the Enabling Protection for Older Children project (EPOCh), standard frontal impact sled tests of 10 CRS (6 high back booster seats; 4 <b>booster</b> <b>cushions)</b> with 10 year old anthropomorphic testing devices (ATDs) were analysed qualitatively, transversally and longitudinally for submarining detection. The methods used included video analysis, descriptive and inferential statistics, principal component analysis, time series analysis, as well as multiple linear regression and logistic regression, applied on both ATD trajectories and ATD instrumentation recordings (dynamic data). From the videos, trajectories and dynamic data, submarining motion is shown to embody an exaggerated slouching movement regardless of the CRS type. The observations and quantitative results confirm that exaggerated forward knee displacement is characteristic of submarining, as well as a very strong criterion for the latter's detection. No other individual trajectory or dynamic variable distinguish clear submarining behaviour, however the regression analyses on dynamic variables establish the association of the pelvis, lumbar and chest as representative of the knee displacement, and demonstrate the combination's capacity to distinguish submarining cases. These findings establish the complexity of the movement involved in submarining and the potential of using current ATD instrumentation for its assessment with CRS. This opens a path for an integral approach to ATD movement in CRS appraisal and suggests considering pelvis, lumbar and chest motion control for submarining prevention...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{protection}} of children in motor vehicle crashes has improved since the introduction of child restraint systems. However, motor vehicle crashes remain {{one of the top}} leading causes of death for children. Today, computer-aided engineering {{is an essential part of}} vehicle development and it is anticipated that safety assessments will increasingly rely on simulations. Therefore, this study presents a review of important biomechanical aspects for the safety of children in cars, including child human body models, for scenarios ranging from on-road driving, emergency maneuvers, and pre-crash events to crash loading. The review is divided into four parts: Crash safety, On-road driving for forward facing children, Numerical whole body models, and Discussion and future outlook. The first two parts provide ample references and a state-of-the-art description of important biomechanical aspects for the safety of children in cars. That children are not small adults has been known for decades and has been considered during the development of current restraints that protect the child in the crash phase. The head, neck, thorax, and pelvis are body areas where development with age changes the biomechanics and the interaction with restraint systems. The rear facing child seat distributes the crash load over a large area of the body and has proved to be a very efficient means of reducing child injuries and fatalities. Children up to age 4 years need to be seated rearward facing for optimal protection, mainly because of the proportionally large head, neck anthropometry and cartilaginous pelvis. Children aged 4 up to 12 years should use a belt positioning booster together with the vehicle seat belt to ensure good protection, as the pelvis is not fully developed and because of the smaller size of these children compared to adults. On-road driving studies have illustrated that children frequently change seated posture and may choose slouched positions that are poor for lap belt interaction if seated directly on the rear seat. Emergency maneuvers with volunteers illustrate that pre-crash loading forces forward-facing children into involuntary postures with large head displacements, having potential influence on the risk of head impact. Children, similar to adults, benefit from the safety systems offered in the vehicle. By providing child adaptability of the vehicle, such as integrated <b>booster</b> <b>cushions,</b> the child-restraint interaction can be further optimized. An example of this is the significant reduction of lap belt misuse when using integrated boosters, due to the simplified and natural positioning of the lap belt in close contact with the pelvis. The research presented in this review illustrates that there is a need for enhanced tools, such as child human body models, to take into account the requirements of children of different ages and sizes in the development of countermeasures. To study how children interact with restraints during on-road driving and during pre- and in-crash events, numerical child models implementing age-specific anthropometric features will be essential. The review of human whole body models covers multi body models (age 1. 5 to 15 years) and finite element models (ages 3, 6, and 10 years). All reviewed child models are developed for crash scenarios. The only finite element models to implement age dependent anthropometry details for the spine and pelvis were a 3 year-old model and an upcoming 10 year-old model. One ongoing project is implementing active muscles response in a 6 year-old multi body model to study pre-crash scenarios. These active models are suitable for the next important step in providing the automotive industry with adequate tools for development and assessment of future restraint systems in the full sequence of events from pre- to in-crash...|$|R
40|$|Motor vehicle crashes {{are among}} the leading causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality among children in the age group of 4 to 8 years. It is of utmost importance that the child is using correct restraints when seated in the car, taking into consideration age, length and weight. Booster cushions are important and effective tools in the effort to protect young children from injuries in car crashes. Injuries to abdomen and spine are nearly completely eliminated in accidents with children seated correctly on booster cushions compared to only seat-belts. Though, despite all benefits, there still remains a high amount of non-use and misuse of booster cushions. Therefore it is a need for continuous improvement of the safety for rear seated children. Studies of integrated booster cushions in the rear seat have shown benefits compared to aftermarket booster cushions, both in increasing the use rate and minimising the problems of misuse of the belt during buckling up, as well as better protection of the children in car crashes. The {{purpose of this study was}} to create a deeper knowledge about how children in the age between 4 - 12 years perform when they are buckling up on booster cushions in the rear seat. Two concepts of booster cushions were included; an integrated <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> (IBC) and an aftermarket <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> (BC). In addition, buckling up with seat belt only was also studied for the older children. The aim of the study was to obtain information of potential misuse; i. e. type and frequency of misuse, belt slack, and time to buckle up. Furthermore, the aim was to identify if age of the children and wearing a winter jacket had an effect. In total, 130 children in the age of 4 - 12 years participated in the study. The distribution between boys and girls was equal, as well as between children wearing or not wearing a winter jacket. The children were from the region of Göteborg and surroundings, where traffic safety aspects often are highlighted, due to large car manufactures in the area. Only children with some experience from booster cushions/seats were used as test subjects. During the tests session, each child buckled up on an integrated <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> (IBC) and an aftermarket <b>booster</b> <b>cushion.</b> The older children (8 - 12 years) also buckled up with seat belt only. Interviews, observations and measurements of height, time to buckle up and amount of belt slack were made. Photographs were also taken to document belt fit. The results showed that 77 % of the children failed to perform correct belt routing under when buckling up on BC. Nearly all cases were severe misuse. Although the majority of the children were familiar with an aftermarket <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> with guiding loops for the belt, this high misuse rate occurred. The misuse rate for IBC was only 4 % (5 cases of 128 children). For seat belt only no misuse was shown. According to the traffic regulation, children shorter than 1350 mm should use additional protective equipment than the seat belt when travelling in cars, which is equal to 54 % of the children included in the study. However, only 26 % stated that they used a booster cushion/seat, which is alarming from a safety point of view. To conclude; the integrated <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> concept has many advantages compared to an aftermarket cushion with guiding loops, both from a safety and comfort point of view. It is easy and quick to handle; has few possibilities to misuse, has an intuitive design, the buckling up sequence is equal to buckling up with the ordinary seat belt, and younger children can buckle up correctly. The majority of children 6 years and older buckle up themselves today, and travel in cars several days a week. They need a restraint system that is comfortable and intuitive in design, easy and quick to handle, to achieve a high usage rate and maximum protection during a crash. The integrated <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> concept fulfils most of these demands to a high extent...|$|E

40|$|Road {{accidents}} with {{participation of}} the children are of particular nature. According to surveys, the older children {{at the age of}} 8 - 12 years are often transported in cars in a wrong way. They are usually fastened with seat belts designed for adult passengers. In order to make the seat belts safe for a child, they should be used together with a <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> or a high back booster seat. This paper presents the test results and analysis of dynamic loads affecting a child {{in the back seat of}} a passenger car during a frontal collision. The car body was accelerated to a speed of about 48 km/h and then it was suddenly stopped in a time of about 100 ms. The analysis was carried out on the basis of results of experimental tests performed at the collision station in the Automotive Industry Institute in Warsaw. The attention was paid to the influence of protection device type on the P 10 dummy, representing a child at the age of about 10 years. Three child protection options during a collision were considered: the dummy was sitting directly in a car seat, on a <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> and on a seat. The dummy was fastened with standard seat belts. Evaluation of the protection device influence on the dummy loads was given in association with the operation of the seat belts.

40|$|In {{car crash}} scenarios, {{the head is}} the most {{frequently}} injured body region among children. The main injury mechanism for rear seated restrained children, aged 3 - 13, who sustained head injuries rated AIS 2 +, {{has been found to}} be the contact of the head with the seat back or with other parts of car interior. Previous studies showed that pre-crash manoeuvres could influence the injury outcome. This thesis quantifies the static belt measurement and the kinematics of child volunteers exposed to steering manoeuvres when restrained on different types of <b>booster</b> <b>cushion.</b> A study was conducted on a test track with 18 children divided into two groups based on their stature. Each child was tested for the static belt measurement on three different booster cushions and performed two steering manoeuvres on each of two of these boosters. Cameras were used to monitor the child during the event. Different parameters were extracted from the videos in order to analyse the kinematics of the child. From the static belt measurement arose that tall children can achieve a better belt fit than short children, especially in terms of shoulder belt position and its “grabbing” effect. The analysis of the kinematics showed that head and torso moved inboard in different ways. The position of the belt on the shoulder was also considered throughout the steering event. The belt slip off the shoulder in 11 trials out of 18 for short children when restrained on the accessory booster, while the slip off occurred only in 2 trials when restrained on integrated booster. For tall children no belt slip off occurred regardless of the type of <b>booster</b> <b>cushion...</b>|$|E
40|$|In a car crash, {{properly}} restrained {{forward facing}} children may sustain head injuries due to {{contact with the}} car interior. Emergency events such as braking and steering will influence the kinematics of the child, thereby affecting the child’s interaction with the restraint systems. Volunteer experiments (Stockman et al. 2013) have shown that children around six years of age, properly restrained on a <b>booster</b> <b>cushion,</b> may slip out of the shoulder belt during a 1 g emergency event, while older children can maintain their posture better. A numerical human body model of the 6 year-old would be a valuable tool to study and improve the performance of restraint systems in the pre-crash phase. Compared to a crash, an emergency event typically has low g and long duration loading; hence, the muscle activity will influence the kinematics of the child. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} work is to develop an active 6 year-old human body model. The 6 year-old facet occupant multi body model in the MADYMO code (TASS, Rijswijk, the Netherlands) was selected. The spine is composed of rigid vertebral bodies connected with spherical joints. Muscle activity was implemented by applying torques at each vertebral joint for flexion-extension and lateral bending. The torque actuators were controlled by proportional, integrative and derivative controllers comparing the current joint angles to an initial posture reference value. The controller gains were based on adult data and scaled by 50 % for a first version of the active child model. The resulting active 6 year-old model was used to simulate the volunteer experiments by Stockman et al. 2013. The model was seated on a <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> and loaded with the average experimental pulse. The first version of the active child model had a significantly improved biofidelity compared to the original facet model, with shape and magnitude of displacements similar to the volunteer data, see Figure. It is concluded that the first version active 6 year-old model can reproduce this specific emergency event. Future work should focus on controller gain optimization and further validation...|$|E

The height of the booster of the seat can be adjusted continuously according to the seated shoulder height of the child passenger. The depth of <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> also can be changed according to the size of the passenger. The sled test with the seat was conducted. The seat simulation models with different booster heights were developed using MADYMO software and validated. Then, these models were used to study the performance of the seat in frontal impact.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify and compare the kinematics and shoulder belt position of child anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) during emergency steering maneuvers. Furthermore, the ATDs were compared to the results from child volunteers aged 4 to 12 in the same test setup (Bohman, Stockman, et al. 2011). Methods: A driving study was conducted on a test track comprising 4 ATDs: the Q 6, Q 10, and Hybrid III (HIII) 6 - and 10 -year-old ATDs restrained in the rear seat of a passenger vehicle. The ATDs were exposed to 2 repeated steering maneuvers in each restraint system. The Q 6 and HIII 6 -year-old were restrained on booster cushions as well as high-back booster seats. The Q 10 and HIII 10 -year-old were restrained on booster cushions or restrained by 3 -point seat belts directly on the seat. Lateral motion of the forehead and upper sternum was determined, as well as shoulder belt movement on shoulder and torso tilting angle. Results: All ATDs began to move approximately at the same point in time corresponding to a vehicle lateral acceleration of just below 0. 2 g. In the later phase of the maneuver, Q 10 had moved 26 percent less than the children when restrained by seat belt only and 35 percent less when on a <b>booster</b> <b>cushion.</b> Corresponding numbers for the HIII 10 -year-old were 43 and 44 percent higher than for children. Compared to children, the Q 6 had moved 34 percent less when restrained on a high-back booster seat and 31 percent less when on a <b>booster</b> <b>cushion.</b> Corresponding numbers for HIII 6 -year-old were 7 and 28 percent higher than for children. Due to extensive variety of lateral displacements observed in the children, child performance range covers both ATD families for the evaluated sizes of 6 - and 10 -year-old ATDs. Conclusions: Compared to children, the HIII ATDs were closer with regards to mean values in the initial phase of the maneuver and the Q ATDs were closer in the end of the ramping phase of the lateral acceleration. The question regarding which ATD replicates better the behavior of children exposed to steering maneuvers still remains open. As shown in this study, it depends on the focus of the comparison and on what phase of the maneuver is of interest. This study provides valuable knowledge on how representative the current ATDs are for replicating potential precrash postures of children as a result of vehicle emergency steering maneuvers for a variety of restraint systems and ATD sizes...|$|E
40|$|Sitting postures {{and comfort}} {{experience}} were analysed from six children aged 7 - 9 (131 - 145 cm) seated on an Integrated <b>Booster</b> <b>Cushion</b> (IBC) and a high-back Booster (hbB) during 1 hour on-road drives respectively. Data was collected from video recordings, questionnaires and interviews. When {{seated on the}} IBC the most frequent posture was with the entire back and shoulders against the backrest and the head upright. On the hbB, the shoulders were seldom against the backrest. The most frequent lateral sitting posture for both boosters was upright with the seat belt {{in contact with the}} neck or mid-shoulder. Moderate and extreme forward and lateral postures occurred occasionally. A positive attitude was found towards the IBC due to possibilities to move freely, the soft seat cushion and the absence of torso supports, but the short seat cushion created some inconvenience. The hbB was perceived hard, created a locked-in feeling and felt unpleasant due to movements when changing postures. The combination of objective and subjective measures provided valuable information regarding children’s sitting behaviour. It is obvious that children do not always sit as in crash tests. Their activities and perceived discomfort influenced the selection of sitting posture and seat belt positions...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To pilot data {{collection}} instruments {{and to make}} a preliminary estimate of the level of incorrect use of car seat belts and child restraints in Fife, Scotland. DESIGN: Cross sectional survey of cars containing adults and children at a number of public sites across Fife in 1995 to assess use of car occupant restraints. Trained road safety officers assessed whether seat restraints were appropriate for the age of the passengers and whether restraints were used correctly. These assessments were based on standards published by the Child Accident Prevention Trust. PARTICIPANTS: The survey gathered data from 596 occupants in 180 cars: 327 adults and 269 children. Ten per cent of drivers who were approached refused to participate. Car occupant restraint was assessed in 180 drivers, 151 front seat passengers, and 265 rear seat passengers. MAIN RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty one occupants wore seat belts, 68 were restrained by a seat belt and <b>booster</b> <b>cushion,</b> 63 in toddler seats, 25 in two way seats, and 18 in rear facing infant carriers. Ninety seven per cent of drivers, 95 % of front seat passengers, and 77 % of rear seat passengers were restrained. However, in 98 (52 %) vehicles at least one passenger was restrained by a device that was used incorrectly. Seven per cent of adults and 28 % of children were secured incorrectly. The commonest errors were loose seat belts and restraint devices not adequately secured to the seat. Rates of incorrect use were highest in child seat restraints, reaching 60 % with two way seats and 44 % with rear facing infant seats. CONCLUSIONS: The incorrect use of car occupant restraints is an under-recognised problem, both by health professionals, and the general public. Incorrect use has been shown to reduce the effectiveness of restraints, can itself result in injury, and is likely to be an important factor in child passenger injuries. The correct use of car seat restraints merits greater attention in strategies aiming to reduce road traffic casualties. Areas of intervention that could be considered include raising public awareness of this problem, improving information and instruction given to those who purchase child restraints, and encouraging increased collaboration between manufacturers of cars and child restraints, in considering safety issues...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Run-off-road events occur {{frequently}} and {{can result in}} severe consequences. Several potential injury-causing mechanisms {{can be observed in}} the diverse types of run-off-road events. Real-world data show that different types of environments, such as rough terrain, ditch types, and whether multiple events occur, may be important contributing factors to occupant injury. Though countermeasures addressing front seat occupants have been presented, studies on rear seat occupant retention in situations such as run-off-road events are lacking. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the seat belt pre-pretensioner effect on rear-seated child-sized anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) during 2 different types of run-off-road events. Methods: The study was carried out using 2 test setups: a rig test with a vehicle rear seat mounted on a multi-axial robot simulating a road departure event into a side ditch and an in-vehicle test setup with a Volvo XC 60 entering a side ditch with a grass slope, driving inside the ditch, and returning back to the road from the ditch. Potential subsequent rollovers or impacts were not included in the test setups. Three different ATDs were used. The Q 6 and Q 10 were seated on an integrated <b>booster</b> <b>cushion</b> and the Hybrid III (HIII) 5 th percentile female was positioned directly on the seat. The seat belt retractor was equipped with a pre-pretensioner (electrical reversible retractor) with 3 force level settings. In addition, reference tests with the pre-pretensioner inactivated were run. Kinematics and the shoulder belt position were analyzed. Results: In rig tests, the left-seated ATD was exposed to rapid inboard lateral loads relative to the vehicle. The displacement for each ATD was reduced when the pre-pretensioner was activated compared to tests when it was inactivated. Maximum inboard displacement occurred earlier in the event for all ATDs when the pre-pretensioner was activated. Shoulder belt slip-off occurred for the Q 6 and Q 10 in tests where the pre-pretensioner was inactivated. During in-vehicle tests, the left-seated ATD was exposed to an inboard movement when entering the road again after driving in the ditch. The maximum inboard head displacement was reduced in tests where the pre-pretensioner was activated compared to tests in which it was inactivated. Conclusions: During both test setups, the activation of the pre-pretensioner resulted in reduced lateral excursion of the Q 6, Q 10, and HIII 5 th percentile female due to the shoulder belt remaining on the shoulder and supporting the side of the lower torso. The results provide new insights into the potential benefits of using a pre-pretensioner to reduce kinematic responses during complex run-off-road events through supporting the seat belt to remain on the shoulder. This study addresses potential countermeasures to improve real-world protection of rear-seated children, and it provides a broader perspective including the influence of precrash kinematics...|$|E
40|$|Child {{casualties}} in car crashes have decreased over the years. Nevertheless, occupant safety in rear seats, especially for children 4 - 12 years old, needs further attention because motor vehicle crashes remain {{the leading cause}} of death and long-term health consequences for children. The aim of this thesis was to obtain comprehensive knowledge of real-life situations for restrained, forward-facing, rear-seated children aged 4 - 12 years, in frontal car crashes as a basis for vehicle safety improvements to reduce long-term health consequences. The thesis is comprised of four studies based on child-specific data from Sweden and the US. Study I was based on injury data from insurance claim files, covering 2619 injured children in Sweden. Study II was an experimental study of restraint misuse, including 130 Swedish children. Study III analyzed crash data included 27 cases from two US databases, to determine injury causation scenarios. Study IV was a driving study of how pre-crash maneuvers affect child occupant kinematics with 16 children included. The results of Study I emphasized the importance of looking beyond acute, severe injuries and also examine injuries (regardless of initial injury severity) resulting in permanent medical impairment. The vast majority of injuries with the higher degree of permanent medical impairment were severe injuries to the head. The most frequent injuries leading to permanent medical impairment were minor injuries to the neck and head. To reduce the risk of head injuries among children in car crashes, a fundamental step is to ensure that vehicle restraint systems are adapted to the child, physically and behaviorally, and that the child is properly restrained. An experimental study (Study II) of children using integrated booster cushions compared to aftermarket belt positioning booster cushions, showed that misuse related to buckling up, a problem for decades, can be reduced to a minimum by the design of an integrated <b>booster</b> <b>cushion.</b> Minimizing misuse will lead to increases in proper positioning of the restraint on the child and may translate to reductions in head injury risk. Therefore, car manufacturers should focus on integrated booster cushions, preferably as standard equipment. Even with proper use, however, restrained children in rear seats sustained head injuries in frontal impacts by impacting their heads on the side interior and on the seat back in front of them. Oblique impacts and pre-crash steering maneuvers contributed to both these injurycausation scenarios (Study III). Therefore, pre-crash steering maneuvers were further explored in a driving study and it was confirmed that these common pre-crash maneuvers can result in an unstable restraint situation that may potentially compromise rear occupant safety in the event of a crash (Study IV). In conclusion, the primary recommendation as a result of this research is to protect the head and neck of child occupants from both minor and severe injuries, since all severity levels of injuries may result in long-term consequences. Frontal impacts, including oblique impacts or maneuvers prior to impact, need to be addressed to develop “tolerant” restraint systems. Furthermore, it is recommendable to design and use vehicle-built-in restraint systems to improve crash safety among children, by facilitating proper use of the restraint and placement on the child, as has been previously done for front-seated adults. To incentivize vehicle manufacturers to accelerate the implementation of child safety improvements within their vehicles, an assessment of child safety for 4 - 12 -year-old children should be included in consumer rating programs and legal requirements...|$|E
