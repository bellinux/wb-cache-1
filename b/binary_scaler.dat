40|$|The double Sing-around {{method was}} {{conceived}} {{by which the}} difference of 	sound velocities in sample liquid and in standard liquid would be precisely 	measured. The method could not be ultimately realized，but from the process 	to test the conception， an idea in which a <b>binary</b> <b>scaler</b> is combined to a 	single Sing-around circuit was yielded. It was confirmed by experiment and 	theory that the latter method has a comparable precision to and much 	simpler circuit construction than the former. By this improved Sing-around 	method，velocities in dilute water-solution of alkali-halide could be measured 	in the concentration range 0. 01 ～ 0. 05 mol/ 1...|$|E
