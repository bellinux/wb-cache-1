First-edition copies of his earlier works have become collector's items. His novel Testosterone was adapted to a film of the same name, though it was not a financial success.

5|$|Apatosaurus was {{the second}} most common sauropod in the Morrison Formation ecosystem, after Camarasaurus. Apatosaurus may have been more solitary than other Morrison Formation dinosaurs. Supersaurus has a greater total length and is the largest of all sauropods from the Morrison Formation. Apatosaurus fossils have only been found in the upper levels of the formation. Those of Apatosaurus ajax are known {{exclusively}} from the upper Brushy Basin Member, about 152–151 mya. A.louisae fossils are rare, known only from one site in the upper Brushy Basin Member; they date to the late Kimmeridgian stage, about 151mya. Additional Apatosaurus remains are known from similarly aged or slightly younger rocks, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been identified as any particular species, and thus may instead belong to Brontosaurus.|$|E

5|$|The Barons of the Cinque Ports {{also participated}} in the ceremony. Formerly, the barons were {{the members of the}} House of Commons {{representing}} the Cinque Ports of Hastings, New Romney, Hythe, Dover and Sandwich. Reforms in the 19thcentury, however, integrated the Cinque Ports into a regular constituency system applied throughout the nation. At later coronations, barons were specially designated from among the city councillors for the specific purpose of attending coronations. Originally, the barons were charged with bearing a ceremonial canopy over the sovereign during the procession to and from Westminster Abbey. The last time the barons performed such a task was at the coronation of GeorgeIV in 1821. The barons did not return for the coronations of WilliamIV (who insisted on a simpler, cheaper ceremonial) and Victoria. At coronations since Victoria's, the barons have attended the ceremony, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> carried canopies.|$|E

25|$|Most of the municipality’s {{territory}} {{is dedicated to}} agriculture. Major crops include barley, corn, sorghum, wheat, maguey, and various vegetables. Orchards also exist there producing capulins, peaches, pears, figs, plums, white sapote, tejocotes and apricots. Livestock includes cattle, pigs, goats and domestic fowl. The second most important economic activity is industry, producing processed foods, drinks, tobacco products and leather goods. Mining is limited to gravel, sand and other construction materials. There are small deposits of gold, silver, copper, quartz and mercury, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been exploited. Most mines are located near the communities of San Pedro Tepetitlan and Xometla. Commerce is mostly limited to serving local needs.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} Indian {{paintings were}} the rock paintings of pre-historic times, the petroglyphs {{as found in}} places like Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka, {{and some of them}} are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of Ellora, Maharashtra state present an example of Indian paintings, and the colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals. Thereafter, frescoes of Ajanta and Ellora caves appeared. India's Buddhist literature is replete with examples of texts which describe that palaces of kings and aristocratic class were embellished with paintings, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> survived. But, it is believed that some form of art painting was practiced in that time.|$|E
25|$|Wednesday {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} {{football}} clubs in the world of any code, and the third oldest professional association football club in England, excluding clubs with informal or disputed foundation dates. In 1868 they won the Cromwell Cup, only the second tournament of its kind, and in 1877 they won the inaugural Sheffield Challenge Cup, the oldest county cup in England. They were founding members and inaugural champions of the Football Alliance in 1889, before joining The Football League three years later. In 1992 they became founder members of the Premier League. The club has spent most of its league history in English football's top flight, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> played at that level since being relegated in 2000.|$|E

25|$|Demonstrators protested {{rising prices}} and demanded the {{dismissal}} of the Prime Minister and his government, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> directly challenged the king, criticism of whom is banned in Jordan. The demonstrators have been peaceful and have not been confronted by the police. So far no deaths, injuries or riots have been reported; however the protests' leaders said that the king had failed to take substantial steps to address mounting public resentment and they warned that unless real changes are made, that unrest could worsen. King Abdullah II, a key U.S. ally, has come under pressure recently from various protesters which include a coalition of Islamists, secular opposition groups {{and a group of}} retired army generals, all of whom are calling for substantial political and economic reforms.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} 1995 that a {{constitutional}} reform recognized such cultural leaders, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been fully restored to previous powers, as so much of society has changed. In the pre-colonial era, all the Acoli believed in the same superior being, lubanga, through an intermediary deity, known as the jok-ker, which meant ‘the ruling deity’. Killing of a person was prohibited but if it took place, negotiations for blood money were led by the victim's family, with agreement followed by rituals of a reconciliation ceremony to restore the killer to the community, and to bring peace between clans. In addition, the people have important rituals for cleansing homes and sites, to welcome back {{people who have been}} away a long time, to clear spirits from places where killings have occurred, and to welcome people who have been captive.|$|E
25|$|The Bristol Unit has {{suffered}} {{along with the}} rest of the BBC from recent staff cuts. Yet it remains confident in the belief that the BBC will maintain it, in spite of the vagaries of fashion, because the Corporation believes that such programmes deserve a place in the schedules of any broadcaster with pretensions of providing a Public Service. In due course, similar specialist Units were also established in London, in order to produce programmes on archaeology and history, on the arts, on music and on science. They too, at one time, had their successes. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> survived as well as the Unit in Bristol. The statutory requirement that a certain percentage of programmes must come from independent producers has reduced in-house production and the Units necessarily shrank proportionately in size. As they dwindled, so the critical mass of their production expertise has diminished. The continuity of their archives has been broken, they have lost the close touch they once had worldwide with their subjects and they are no longer regarded internationally as the centres of innovation and expertise that they once were.|$|E
