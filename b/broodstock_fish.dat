40|$|A simple, rapid PCR assay for the {{identification}} of Renibacterium salmoninarum in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) tissues detected DNA extracted from between 4 and 40 bacterial cells. PCR was at least as sensitive as culture when {{it was used to}} identify subclinically infected fish experimentally challenged with R. salmoninarum. However, PCR identified much higher numbers of kidney tissue and ovarian fluid samples from commercially reared <b>broodstock</b> <b>fish</b> to be positive for R. salmoninarum than did culture. This difference {{may be due to the}} antibiotic chemotherapy of <b>broodstock</b> <b>fish</b> used by the industry in 1994 to control the vertical transmission of R. salmoninarum. A much closer relationship between PCR and culture results was observed for ovarian fluid samples collected from <b>broodstock</b> <b>fish</b> in 1993. Also, PCR scored a much higher percentage of kidney tissue samples than ovarian fluid samples from 1994 <b>broodstock</b> <b>fish</b> positive for R. salmoninarum, which may reflect the uneven distribution of the pathogen in different fish tissues. Inclusion of a nested probe to identify the PCR-positive 1994 ovarian fluid samples increased the sensitivity of detection to between one and four cells and the number of samples that scored positive by almost threefold. These data indicate that many infected ovarian fluid samples contained very low numbers of R. salmoninarum cells and, because almost all these samples were culture negative, that PCR may have detected dead or otherwise unculturable bacterial cells...|$|E

40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{composition of}} fish eggs {{is often used}} as an indicator for assessing the nutritional requirements of aquaculture species during their larval stages. Fatty acids of the (n- 3) HUFA type have proven to {{play a critical role}} in providing good growth, survival and stress resistance in marine fish larvae. Hence, analyzing these fatty acids in fish eggs may provide interesting data on the requirements for those essential nutrients. By comparing the analyses of wild versus <b>broodstock</b> <b>fish</b> eggs differences may appear, possibly explaining differences in egg quality. Intra-spawning-season differences may further appear by following fatty acid profiles in the course of time. Finally, the influence of broodstock nutritionon egg composition may be another variable to consider in the evaluation of the above. In this study freshly released eggs of European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), seabream (Sparus aurata), and red seabream (Pagrus major) were collected from <b>broodstock</b> <b>fish</b> held under different conditions in various hatcheries. Temporal variations in fatty acid profiles were monitored by following a seabream broodstock during 1 month. The effect of feedig broodstock with fish-oil coated pellets on the fatty acid profiles of the eggs produced, was established for seabream. The results indicate that for the three species the content of 22 : 6 n- 3 is considerably higher than 20 : 5 n- 3. Total (n- 3) HUFA on dry weight basis appears highest in seabass while on a relative basis (% of total fatty acids) the highest levels are found in seabream eggs and the lowest in red seabream. Differences between seabass eggs from females caught in the wild and naturally spawned <b>broodstock</b> <b>fish</b> kept in captivity, occur particularly in the lower content (half) of 22 : 6 n- 3 in the wild eggs.

Results showed a lower lipid content in embryos and larvae from estuarine populations than those from fresh water, denoting the influence of environmental conditions. The n- 3 :n- 6 ratio was higher in eggs from estuarine and cultured populations, being in the range of marine fishes, whereas for eggs from freshwater fish was lower and typical of freshwater fishes. The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), particularly docosahexaenoic acid (22 : 6 n- 3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (20 : 5 n- 3), were higher in eggs and larvae of broodstock coming from culture or estuarine environments than in those from fresh water. Moreover, these fatty acids markedly increased after hatching in larvae coming from estuarine populations, suggesting the effect of the environment on fatty acid profiles to physiologically prepare the larvae to adapt to higher salinity conditions. Linoleic acid (18 : 2 n- 6) content was higher in fresh water fish and its reduction during embryo and larval development was accompanied by a significant increase of arachidonic acid (20 : 4 n- 6), which was not observed in embryos or larvae from <b>broodstock</b> <b>fish</b> from estuary or aquaculture origin.

40|$|Stock {{enhancement}} of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salarL.), a fish of considerable {{economic and social}} importance, is commonplace. Supportive-breeding is a well-recognised method of enhancement which, when compared with traditional hatchery practices, is thought to reduce the severity of selection pressures on <b>broodstock</b> <b>fish.</b> Critically, in supportive-breeding programmes, the eggs and sperm used in the breeding process are taken from wild adult fish originating from the same catchment that resulting juvenile fish are subsequently stocked into, thereby avoiding problems associated {{with a lack of}} local adaptation in the stocked fish. Previous studies have indicated that sex bias during the hatchery process may result in reduced genetic diversity of the offspring. Utilising 16 microsatellite loci and two expressed sequence tag (EST) loci, we examined progeny from two hatcheries located on the rivers Exe and Tamar in southwest England, assessing the genetic diversity and parental contribution at each. Two strains were assessed within each hatchery. Genetic diversity was found to be reduced in offspring compared with that of the parent fish. This is likely the result of utilising a small number of broodstock in combination with parental bias. In the four hatchery strains studied (Bar, LEx, Lyd and TXL), parental contribution ranged between 2. 1 and 29. 2 %, 12. 2 – 51. 0 %, 2. 0 – 70. 0 % and 4. 0 – 40. 0 %, respectively. If this practice is to be continued, efforts should be made to improve adherence to national rearing guidelines by increasing the number of <b>broodstock</b> <b>fish</b> utilised and ensuring a more balanced contribution of all adults during the crossing process.

Hatchery fish originating from two prior generation hatchery parents had < 20 % of the reproductive success of natural origin spawners. In contrast, hatchery females originating from a cross between two natural origin parents of the prior generation had equivalent or better reproductive success than natural origin females. Males originating from such a cross had reproductive success of 26 - 93 % that of natural males.

40|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>broodstock</b> {{raised in}} an {{aquaculture}} setting {{must be provided}} with a diet not only adequate {{to meet the demands}} of their basic metabolic functions, but also to support reproduction. The frequency, ration, and types of nutrients provided within a diet are all very important to the performance of broodstock. The eastern rainbowfish, Melanotaenia splendida splendida, can be easily reared and readily spawn in captivity. This species has many characteristics that make it a good model species for reproductive experiments and is also commercially important to the aquarium trade. Studies were carried out to investigate the effects of nutrition on reproductive performance of this species. Firstly, experiments were carried out to establish the basic reproductive parameters of M. splendida splendida. Periods of starvation were then carried out to gauge which parameters would be the more effective indicators for reproductive performance of the <b>fish</b> <b>broodstock.</b> It was determined that egg number, survival to eyed embryo, hatching rate, and unfed larval life were the parameters that would indicate reproductive success of this fish. The next two studies were carried out to evaluate feeding frequency and feeding ration on reproductive performance in this species. Different feeding regimes were designed with feeding frequencies at every one, two, three, four and five days and feeding rations of 100 %, 50 %, 25 %, and 12. 5 % satiation. The results showed that the reproductive parameters significantly declined when fish were fed less then every day, and less then 100 % satiation. The effects of energy, protein and lipid content on reproduction were then assessed. Diets containing 17 MJ Kg- 1, 14 MJ Kg- 1 and 11 MJ Kg- 1 were made and tested. The 17 MJ KG- 1 energy diet resulted in the highest egg number as well as the longest unfed larval life. The protein experiment examined the effects of three protein levels, 35 %, 43 % and 50 %, on reproductive parameters. The results showed that the 35 % protein level gave reduced reproductive success (p 0. 05). The 43 % protein diet was recommended for subsequent experiments as it resulted in the longest unfed larval life and it would theoretically cost less to provide and would likely reduce water quality problems. Three diets containing 20 %, 12 % and 9 % lipid were evaluated. The 20 % lipid diet caused deformities in larvae, and led to reduced fertilisation and hatching rates. The 12 % lipid diet gave the best overall results (p 0. 05), however, supplementation of the diet with all three fatty acids resulted in significantly longer unfed larval life (p< 0. 05). In summary, the results of the current study showed that a diet containing 17 MJ KG- 1 energy, 43 % protein, 12 % lipid and supplemented with all three fatty acids at the levels tested would maximise the level of reproduction in M. splendida splendida...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the broad objectives to assess the existing situation of <b>broodstock</b> management and <b>fish</b> seed production in private fish seed farms in Bangladesh. The data were collected from 100 private hatcheries and 40 nurseries in seven upazilas under four districts. There was no shed in forty hatcheries and the owners faced many problems. Brood fish ponds were found suitable for rearing brood fish. About 66 % of the hatchery owners collected brood fish from their own ponds and ponds of neighboring areas. Activities like pond preparation; manuring and supplementary feeding were done properly but stocking density of brood fish in 76 % of the hatcheries was 3, 000 - 7, 000 kg/ha. Infection of argulosis was found in brood fish of 87 % of the hatcheries. About 67 % of the hatchery owners practiced inter-species crossing. Major problems faced by the hatchery owners were argulosis of brood fish, unavailability of pure brood stock, inadequate brood fish pond. The hatchery owners were found interested to find out the preventive measures of argulosis, develop pure brood stock of indigenous carp and import pure strain of exotic carp. According to the nursery operators, they cultivated hybrid fry because of high demand, rapid growth and good taste. Problems of using hatchery spawn as mentioned by the nursery operators were inbreeding, under sized and aged brood stock, stunted growth, physical deformities and high mortality of spawn due to unknown causes...|$|R
40|$|International {{trade of}} marine {{ornamental}} fishes has been expanding rapidly in recent years, {{and the fact}} that nearly 98 % of the species traded are collected from reef habitats is of vital concern for the conservation of the fragile coral reef ecosystem. Hence, it is widely accepted that the ultimate answer to a long-term sustainable trade of marine ornamental fishes is only through the development of hatchery production technologies. The techniques for broodstock development, breeding and seed production of three species of damsel fishes viz. the three spot damsel, Dascyllus trimaculatus, the humbug damsel, Dascyllus aruanus and the blue damsel, Pomacentrus caeruleus, were developed and standardised, which can be scaled up for commercial level production. Broodstock development was done in one-tonne Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP) tanks with biological filter and by feeding with natural feeds. The size range of <b>broodstock</b> <b>fish</b> of D. trimaculatus, D. aruanus and P. caeruleus were 9 - 10, 7 - 8 and 7 - 9 cm, respectively. The number of eggs per spawning ranged from 5000 to 15000. The interval between two successive spawnings ranged from 3 to 14 days. The eggs were attached either {{on the sides of the}} broodstock tank or on the substratum provided in the broodstock tank. Parental care by the male was noted...|$|E
40|$|The {{techniques}} for the capture, transportation, handling, sexing, sampling and acclimation of humpback grouper broodstock have been adequately developed. Prophylaxis using freshwater, antibiotics and quarantine is necessary before introducing broodstock into the maturation tank. A {{detailed description of}} prophylaxis and quarantine techniques is available in work by Sugama et. al. (2001). Recent advances have led to improved handling to reduce stress coupled with improved broodstock nutrition and good water quality and could increase overall egg quality. This leads to higher first feeding success rate and subsequent higher survival throughout the early developmental stages. Maturation and spawning Following quarantine and acclimation, <b>broodstock</b> <b>fish</b> are stocked in a maturation tank. The tank system is a flow-trough, achieving 200 - 300 % water exchange daily. Generally, 30 fish are stocked in 100 -ton tank with sex ratio of two females and one male. Fish are fed with mixed fresh or frozen trash fish (avoid using only Sardinella sp.) and squid mixed with 1 % vitamin mix at 2 - 3 % of body weight per day. Six to eight months after stocking in tank, the fish spawn naturally in captivity. The spawning usually occurs every month 7 - 10 days {{before and after the}} new moon phase and spawning takes place from midnight to early morning...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of two rearing conditions: outdoor {{environment}} with great volume tanks (500 m 3) and low stocking density (~ 0. 4 kg m 3); and indoor environment with smaller volume tanks (10 m 3) and higher stocking density (~ 5 kg m 3), on muscle, liver and ovary lipid composition of Seriola dumerili brood- stock born in captivity. The rearing conditions tested seem to affect the pattern of lipid body depo- sition in <b>broodstock</b> <b>fish</b> of S. dumerili, increasing the muscle and liver triacylglycerides (TG) accu- mulation of fish kept under indoor conditions, probably due to reduced energy expenditure in swimming, with some variations in the fatty acid profile that may respond to the differences in the culture conditions tested. No significant differences were found for Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) or ovary lipid deposition between groups in this study, which may suggest that the conditions tested do not have a major effect on ovary devel- opment. However, one season later the females kept under outdoor conditions released eggs spontaneously, whereas those kept under indoor conditions did not spawn, suggesting that the conditions tested actually have an effect on the broodstock’s reproductive fitness. More studies are needed in order to evaluate whether the condi- tions tested have or not any influence on ovary development. En prensa 1, 203...|$|E
40|$|Grouper seeding {{technology}} still {{relies on}} the broodstock from the ocean, eventhough, {{the existence of the}} broodstock is rare and difficult to obtain. The broodstock {{takes a long time to}} mature and spawn. Therefore, to anticipate the scarcity humpback grouper from wild, it is important to produce broodfish from aquaculture. This study was aimed to know the reproduction performance of humpback grouper wild broodstock F- 0, first generation broodstock (F- 1) and second generation broodstock (F- 2). The cultured of humback grouper broodstock used three tanks 75 m 3 in volume (tank I, II and tank III). Tank I: reared 35 <b>fishes</b> <b>broodstock</b> F- 0. Tank II and tank III for reared each 50 fishes F- 1 and F- 2 broodstock. Food for broodstock from the wild (F- 0) was given from fresh trash fish, squid, and added vitamin mixture, vitamin C and vitamin E. Meanwhhile, food given to F- 1 and F- 2 broodstock was a commercial dry pellet (PG 9 - 10) that contains following nutrients: protein content of 43 %, min. fat of 9 %, ash content of 13 %, fiber levels of 2 %, and moisture content of 12 %. Mixture of vitamin C and E were also added. The results showed that the humpback grouper F- 0, F- 1 and F- 2 were cultured in 75 m 3 concrete tank was successfully spawn with the fertilization rate of 87 %, 78 % and 45 % respectively. This result proves that the broodstock from F- 0 gaved the best results...|$|R
40|$|Administration of {{bioactive}} compounds to <b>fish</b> <b>broodstock</b> {{in captivity}} usually involves handling {{that results in}} undue stress. This is particularly true in late maturing species, which are considerable in size at sexual maturity. We are therefore exploring non-invasive methods of delivery to address this issue. For this talk, I will present our on-going work on the recombinant Southern Bluefin tuna luteinizing hormone (tuna LH), which we aim to deliver through the diet. LH regulates {{the final stages of}} maturation as well as the release of eggs in fish. These reproductive events are compromised in tuna broodstock held in captivity. Using molecular methods, we designed and created a recombinant DNA construct that encodes for the tuna LH. The construct can be converted into the functional hormone once introduced in live fish. We are collaborating with the laboratory of Prof Ming-Wei Lu, from National Taiwan Ocean University, who developed the technology to package DNA constructs in liposomes, which have been shown to protect DNA from stomach acids as well as facilitate the entry of DNA through the intestinal wall. We are currently evaluating the biological activity of the introduced recombinant tuna LH in tilapia, which belongs to the same phylogenetic order as tuna. As one of the indicators of the effect of the recombinant tuna LH, we are determining the expression level of the aromatase gene, {{which is one of the}} genes in the gonad that is directly regulated by LH. Preliminary results have shown an increase of aromatase expression in treated fish. In the long term, we aim to test the system in Southern Bluefin tuna broodstock...|$|R

The aims of this research were to understand reproduction aspects of true percula clown <b>fish</b> <b>broodstock</b> in an aquarium. A pair of broodstock used in this experiment were 4 - 9 cm in total length and maintained in an aquarium of 60 x 40 x 30 cm 3 dimension. Numbers of brrodstock were 18 pairs and each aquarium filled with one pair of broodstock. During the experiment, fish were fed with artificial feed first and one hour later with mysids shrimp and copepod until satiation twice a day. Parameters observed were broodstock size, numbers and hatching rate of eggs. The results showed, the size of spawned female were range from 6. 6 - 9. 5 cm and male from 4. 6 - 6. 2 cm. Average of eggs produced per spawning was varied 423 ± 255 with the average of spawning frequency was 2. 78 ± 0. 38 times/month. Broodstock was spawn partially with the maximum spawning frequency of single broodstock was 4 times/month. The biggest female with size of 9. 5 cm was still productive and spawn 3 times/month. There {{was a pair of}} broodstock which can produce more than 700 eggs/spawning. This results indicated that true percula clown fish can spawn throughout the year in the aquarium with varied of eggs number and spawning frequency for each individual and spawning period.
