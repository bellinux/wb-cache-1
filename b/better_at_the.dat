He has two {{brothers}} (Allan and David) and a sister (Pam). As a young child, Anderson did not enjoy the game of ice hockey. His first ever goal was in his own net. However, as he grew older, and <b>better</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> game, Anderson's love of the game increased.|$|E

At the Fleet track meet, Battleship Division Nine finished second, and did even <b>better</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> annual boxing championships, {{the pinnacle of}} the Grand Fleet sporting year. An engineman from Florida won the lightweight title, a chief carpenter's mate from New York won the middleweight title, and a fireman from the same ship reached the heavyweight finals.|$|E

Menchov's ride propelled him into the pink jersey, while Leipheimer narrowly missed taking enough time out of Di Luca to move past him in the general classification.

5|$|In {{the present}} day, Walt's partner Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) has just shot Gale {{to death on}} orders from Walt to foil Gus' plot to kill and replace them. Gus' henchman Victor (Jeremiah Bitsui) arrives at Gale's {{apartment}} and finds him dead, surrounded by neighbors who have just called the police. Victor finds a stunned Jesse sitting in his car outside and forces him at gunpoint {{to return to the}} meth lab, where Gus' employee Mike (Jonathan Banks) is holding Walt hostage. Mike, who is concerned that Victor was seen by bystanders at the murder scene, calls to inform Gus of the events. Victor, who has often watched Walt work, starts cooking meth himself to prove they do not need him or Jesse. Walt grows concerned when Victor proves <b>better</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> process than he expected.|$|E
5|$|Matilda's {{fortunes}} {{changed dramatically}} for the <b>better</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of 1141. Ranulf of Chester, a powerful northern magnate, {{had fallen out}} with the King over the winter and Stephen had placed his castle in Lincoln under siege. In response, Robert of Gloucester and Ranulf advanced on Stephen's position with a larger force, resulting in the Battle of Lincoln on 2 February 1141. The King commanded the centre of his army, with Alan of Brittany on his right and William of Aumale on his left. Robert and Ranulf's forces had a superiority in cavalry and Stephen dismounted many of his own knights to form a solid infantry block. After an initial success in which William's forces destroyed the Angevins' Welsh infantry, the battle went well for Matilda's forces. Robert and Ranulf's cavalry encircled Stephen's centre, and the King found himself surrounded by the Angevin army. After much fighting, Robert's soldiers finally overwhelmed Stephen and he was taken away from the field in custody.|$|E

5|$|Project M {{first began}} as a {{development}} project to rework the character Falco to play like he did in Melee. The designers' goal {{at the time was}} for the game to be accessible to newcomers and encourage people to get <b>better</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> game, which was accomplished by creating a character roster that is more balanced. The mod's first demo was announced on January 15, 2011, with a release date of late January or early February in time for the Pound 5 tournament, where it was featured. It featured 14 of the 39 characters in Brawl, as well as new stages Brawl had not included. It was later given a solid date of February 7, 2011. A patch was later created to fix the demo's bugs and fine-tune the player's control of their movement direction after being attacked.|$|E
5|$|Rome had, in {{the earlier}} Punic Wars, gained large tracts of {{territory}} in Africa, which they consolidated in the following centuries. Much of that land had been granted to the kingdom of Numidia, a kingdom on the north African coast approximating to modern Algeria, in return for its past military assistance. The Jugurthine War of 111–104 BC was fought between Rome and Jugurtha of Numidia and constituted the final Roman pacification of Northern Africa, after which Rome largely ceased expansion on the continent after reaching natural barriers of desert and mountain. In response to Jugurtha's usurpation of the Numidian throne, a loyal ally of Rome since the Punic Wars, Rome intervened. Jugurtha impudently bribed the Romans into accepting his usurpation and was granted half the kingdom. Following further aggression and further bribery attempts, the Romans sent an army to depose him. The Romans were defeated at the Battle of Suthul but fared <b>better</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Muthul and finally defeated Jugurtha at the Battle of Thala, the Battle of Mulucha, and the Battle of Cirta (104 BC). Jugurtha was finally captured not in battle but by treachery, ending the war.|$|E

He married Nancy Ord in 1956 and began training for that year's Summer Olympics, where he again finished 12th in a field of 44 competitors in the 50 m rifle three positions event and 31st in among 44 participants in the 50 m rifle prone tournament.|$|E

5|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} honors in different categories, ranging from {{recognition of the}} movie itself, to its direction, cinematography and writing, {{as well as for}} performances by the cast, mainly John Hawkes for Best Supporting Actor and Jennifer Lawrence for Best Actress. Lawrence's role in this movie also earned her several Best Breakthrough Performance awards. At the 68th Golden Globe Awards ceremony, Winter's Bone earned one nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. It received four nominations—including Best Actress—at the 83rd Academy Awards, but failed to win any accolades. Lawrence, at 20, was the second-youngest person ever nominated for best actress by the academy at that time. The movie fared <b>better</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 26th Independent Spirit Awards, where it received seven nominations and won awards for Best Supporting Female and Best Supporting Male. Both the principal actors earned a nomination at the 17th Screen Actors Guild Awards.|$|E
5|$|He went one <b>better</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1996 Atlanta Olympics, {{where he}} beat Fernando Meligeni {{to win the}} bronze medal, thus {{becoming}} the first Indian to win an individual medal since KD Jadhav won bronze at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics {{more than four decades}} earlier. Paes cited the match as one of his greatest performances on the court, in part because his wrist was severely injured. He was awarded the highest sporting honour by the government of India, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna in 1996. His first successful year in the ATP circuit came in 1993, when he partnered Sébastien Lareau to reach the US Open doubles semifinal. After having a moderate season in 1994, he reached the quarter-finals of the 1995 Australian Open doubles with Kevin Ullyett. From 1996, he partnered with fellow-Indian Mahesh Bhupathi, which would prove to be a winning combination. Their first year was not a very successful one, especially in the Grand Slams, with a round of 32 finish at Wimbledon being the best. 1997 proved to be a much better year for the team of Paes and Bhupathi, with the semifinals of the US Open their best Grand Slam result. Paes climbed the doubles ranking from no. 89 {{at the beginning of the}} year to no. 14 at the end of the year. That year he also made his best singles performance in a Grand Slam, getting to the third round of the 1997 US Open, beating Carlos Costa and Arnaud Boetsch before losing to Cédric Pioline.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rain}} had stopped come race time, the track was still wet and {{slippery}} and all drivers opted to start on intermediate tyres. Hamilton got away <b>better</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start, entering the first corner alongside pole-sitter Rosberg and, by forcing the German wide, took the lead exiting turn one. Getting off track saw Rosberg lose additional positions, running fifth behind Hamilton, Kvyat, Ricciardo and Pérez. Further back, a collision involved Alonso, Massa, the two Sauber cars of Ericsson and Nasr as well as Bottas, who made a pit stop after the first lap, as did Nasr, who was the first to fit slick tyres, as the track was starting to dry. Will Stevens was touched from behind by teammate Alexander Rossi, breaking his rear wing and forcing him to retire. Having started {{from the back of the}} grid, Carlos Sainz profited from the incidents and was up to tenth by the end of the first lap. While Rosberg soon took back fourth from Pérez, Hamilton in front came under pressure from Kvyat, with the Red Bull drivers running fast in the damp conditions. With Kvyat just half a second behind the championship leader, a virtual safety car period was declared on lap five to clear the debris from the first corner incident. On lap 7, Valtteri Bottas retired with a damper failure caused by the turn one contact. When the virtual safety car ended on lap 8, Rosberg made an immediate move on Ricciardo to move into third, overtaking Kvyat for second on the same lap. Romain Grosjean became another victim of the accident on lap one, when he came into the pit lane for a second time on lap 12 and retired. By the same time, Sebastian Vettel had moved up into sixth place from thirteenth on the grid. Up front, Kvyat went wide while trying to overtake Rosberg, allowing teammate Ricciardo through into third; Ricciardo in turn made a successful manoeuvre on Rosberg to move up into second.|$|E

25|$|The {{compound}} {{eye and the}} ocelli supply insect vision. The compound eye {{consists of}} individual light receptive units called ommatidia. Some ants may have only one or two, however dragonflies may have over 10,000. The more ommatidia the greater the visual acuity. These units have a clear lens system and light sensitive retina cells. By day, the image flying insects receive {{is made up of}} a mosaic of specks of differing light intensity from all the different ommatidia. At night or dusk, visual acuity is sacrificed for light sensitivity. The ocelli are unable to form focused images but are sensitive mainly, to differences in light intensity. Colour vision occurs in all orders of insects. Generally insects see <b>better</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> blue end of the spectrum than at the red end. In some orders sensitivity ranges can include ultraviolet.|$|E

These included the successful Henry Koster outing Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation (1962), and the less memorable films Take Her, She's Mine (1963) and Dear Brigitte (1965), which featured French model Brigitte Bardot {{as the object of}} Stewart's son's mash notes.
