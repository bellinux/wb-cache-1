5|$|The lungs of most {{frogs and}} other {{amphibians}} are simple and balloon-like, with gas exchange {{limited to the}} outer surface of the lung. This is not very efficient, but amphibians have low metabolic demands and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by diffusion across their skin in water, and supplement their oxygen supply by the same method. Amphibians employ a positive pressure system to get air to their lungs, forcing air down into the lungs by buccal pumping. This is distinct from most higher vertebrates, who use a <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> driven by negative pressure where the lungs are inflated by expanding the rib cage. In buccal pumping, {{the floor of the}} mouth is lowered, filling the mouth cavity with air. The throat muscles then presses the throat against the underside of the skull, forcing the air into the lungs.|$|E

25|$|In {{closed circuit}} SCUBA (rebreather) diving, exhaled carbon dioxide {{must be removed}} from the <b>breathing</b> <b>system,</b> usually by a {{scrubber}} containing a solid chemical compound with a high affinity for CO2, such as soda lime. If not removed from the system, it may be re-inhaled, causing an increase in the inhaled concentration.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, {{certification}} of the Mark 16 Mod 1 rebreather was completed following improvement of systems including, {{extension of the}} working limit to , new decompression tables for both nitrogen-oxygen and helium-oxygen diving including new repetitive diving capabilities for helium-oxygen, test of an Emergency <b>Breathing</b> <b>System</b> with communications, the addition of an integrated buoyancy compensation device, and an improved full face mask.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{technical}} problem with {{recovery of the}} exhaled gas. Simply venting it to a return hose through a non-return valve will not work, as the hose must be maintained at exactly the ambient pressure at {{the depth of the}} helmet, otherwise the gas from the helmet will either free-flow out under pressure, or not flow out at all because of back pressure. This obstacle is overcome by using an exhaust valve working on the same principle as the demand valve, which opens the exhaust valve by using the leverage of a diaphragm sensing the pressure difference between the helmet interior pressure and the ambient pressure, This only requires the pressure in the reclaim hose to be lower than ambient at the diver to function. The same principle is used in a diving chamber's Built-in <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> (BIBS).|$|E

40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that anaesthetic <b>breathing</b> <b>systems</b> are poorly designed, and {{would benefit from}} engineering modeling to improve function. The use of <b>breathing</b> <b>systems</b> in different environments is described. Bath fp, a software package, developed in the Department of Mechanical Engineering for mathematically modelling hydraulic <b>systems</b> such as <b>breathing</b> <b>systems,</b> is introduced. Bath fp was used to model the behaviour of anaesthetic circle systems at high, medium, low and minimum fresh gas flows (FGFs). Using 50 % nitrous oxide in oxygen ('entonox') as a gas model for all such volatile anaesthetic agents, the behaviour of the system was observed in terms of gas concentrations, volumetric flow-rates and airway pressures. Anaesthetic circle systems studied included standard adult and paediatric systems, and a coaxial system. In the standard systems, different tubing lengths and diameters were modelled, and for the coaxial system, different diameter ratios of outer and inner tubes were modelled. Gas concentration changes {{at different points in}} the system were used to clarify system function at different FGFs. Management of exhaled carbon dioxide was examined, including changing absorber volume. A venturi was modelled and added to a valveless coaxial circle system, to see how the venturi changed system function, and under what conditions it might fail. Clinical data were collected to validate modelling results. Nineteen adult volunteers were recruited to a trial, in which entonox was breathed through standard and coaxial systems for short periods, at different FGFs, with high flow air-breathing periods in between. Data on gas concentrations were collected from three points in each system. Results were analysed, and function was compared between different systems, and between systems and modelling results. The simulation model clarified circle system function, and showed that function depended more on FGF than on geometry. The clinical data supported the use of simulation to predict the behaviour of <b>breathing</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
25|$|Hatching from an egg to {{the first}} larval stage takes about eight hours to one day. Larvae have three stages of {{development}} (instars); each stage is separated by a molting event. The instars are separable by examining the posterior spiracles, or openings to the <b>breathing</b> <b>system.</b> The larvae use proteolytic enzymes in their excreta (as well as mechanical grinding by mouth hooks) to break down proteins on the livestock or corpse on which they are feeding. Blow flies are poikilothermic – {{the rate at which}} they grow and develop is highly dependent on temperature and species. Under room temperature (about 20°C), the black blow fly Phormia regina can change from egg to pupa in 150–266 hours (six to 11 days). When the third larval stage is complete, it will leave the corpse and burrow into the ground to pupate, emerging as an adult seven to fourteen days later.|$|E
500|$|Plain {{manifolded}} twin sets, or manifolded doubles with {{a single}} regulator, [...] consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves connected by a manifold but only one regulator {{is attached to the}} manifold. This makes it relatively simple and cheap but means there is no redundant functionality to the <b>breathing</b> <b>system,</b> only a double gas supply. This arrangement was fairly common {{in the early days of}} scuba when low-pressure cylinders were manifolded to provide a larger air supply than was possible from the available single cylinders. It is still in use for large capacity bailout sets for deep commercial diving.|$|E
500|$|... "Cx70" [...] heliox {{tables were}} {{developed}} {{and used by}} Comex between 1970 and 1982. The tables were available in two versions. One was designed for surface-supplied diving and limited to 75m. The diver breathed heliox as the bottom mix and 100% oxygen at the 6m stop. The other was designed for closed bell bounce diving and allowed for exposures up to 120 minutes, and depths to 120m. The diver breathed heliox {{in the water and}} in the bell, air after transfer into the deck decompression chamber, and finally oxygen on built in <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> (BIBS) from 12m to the surface. These tables produced a relatively high incidence of decompression sickness.|$|E

40|$|The {{resistance}} to airflow {{of the components}} of <b>breathing</b> <b>systems</b> have been examined pre-viously. Tracheal tubes and their connectors have been studied by a number of authors [1, 2] and expiratory valves by others [3, 4]. Smith [5] examined the resistance of the Magill system for both separate and assembled components. Shandro [6] studied the Ayre's T-piece, Bain and several circle <b>systems.</b> Several new <b>breathing</b> <b>systems</b> have been developed in recent years, and changes have been introduced, into both the design of their compo-nents and the materials used.

METHODS The apparatus used to measure resistance to airflow was described by Gaensler and colleagues [7] and is shown in figure 1. Air was supplied from a cylinder through a variable pressure regulator (Murex Saffire BS 5741). The airflow rate was controlled by a needle valve and measured by a flowmeter (Platon Gap Meter type GTLK laboratory flow meter). The air was passed into a 10 -litre glass bottle, which was used to avoid any Venturi effect [8]. The outlet of this bottle was fitted with a standard 22 -mm male connector, to which apparatus under investigation was connected either directly or vi...|$|R

Experiments focused on the <b>BREATHe</b> I <b>system</b> used for treatment of graywater and waste gas from a solids biological treatment process. In this first experimental phase, prototype benchtop reactors were constructed to evaluate surfactant removal. Surfactants, the major component of detergents, are the primary area of concern for graywater treatment. The recirculation rate was varied between 10 and 20 times the influent flow rate to determine the required recirculation rate for 90 % COD removal from the influent wastestream. A recirculation rate of 20 times the inflow rate was required for 90 % COD removal. Biological growth rate experiments were performed using two commercial laundry detergents (Tide and Cheer). Biological growth was observed in both cases and growth rates increased with increasing concentrations of Tide. Conversely, increases in Cheer concentrations resulted in lower biological growth rates, possibly due to toxicity. Description: 8 page...|$|R
500|$|Large meat-eating dinosaurs had {{a complex}} system of air sacs {{similar to those}} found in modern birds, {{according}} to a 2005 investigation led by Patrick M. O'Connor.

[...] "What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds", O'Connor said. In 2008, scientists described Aerosteon riocoloradensis, the skeleton of which supplies the strongest evidence to date of a dinosaur with a bird-like <b>breathing</b> <b>system.</b> CT-scanning of Aerosteons fossil bones revealed evidence for the existence of air sacs within the animal's body cavity.|$|E
500|$|A multiplace chamber is the {{preferred}} facility for treatment of decompression sickness as it allows direct physical access to the patient by medical personnel, but monoplace chambers are more widely available and {{should be used for}} treatment if a multiplace chamber is not available or transportation would cause significant delay in treatment, as the interval between onset of symptoms and recompression is important to the quality of recovery.

2500|$|Lowering {{the oxygen}} content {{increases}} the {{maximum operating depth}} and duration of the dive before which oxygen toxicity becomes a limiting factor.

A maximum oxygen partial pressure of 1.4 bar for the active sectors of the dive, and 1.6 bar for decompression stops is recommended by several recreational and technical diving certification agencies for open circuit, and 1.2 bar or 1.3 bar as maximum for the active sectors of a dive on closed circuit rebreather.|$|E

If compressed air is used, then an oxygen mask or hood is needed as in a multiplace chamber. Most monoplace chambers can be fitted with a demand <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> for air breaks. In low pressure soft chambers, treatment schedules may not require air breaks, because the risk of oxygen toxicity is low due to the lower oxygen partial pressures used (usually 1.3 ATA), and short duration of treatment.|$|E
