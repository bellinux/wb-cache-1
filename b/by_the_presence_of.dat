5|$|Another {{well-known}} artefact with {{an astronomical}} use is the Antikythera mechanism.

5|$|Astrophysicist Alice C. Quillen and her student Stephen Thorndike {{performed}} {{computer simulations}} {{of the structure}} of the dust disk around Epsilon Eridani.

40|$|A {{patient with}} duplications of the {{internal}} organs and external structures of {{the lower half of}} the body might have traditionally been explained <b>by</b> incomplete twinning. <b>The</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> a fifth digit-like structure protruding from the lower abdomen and facial and cranial abnormalities suggested that, instead, he might be an example of the disorganisation mutant.

5|$|Cetaceans {{are divided}} into two parvorders: the largest parvorder, Mysticeti (baleen whales), is {{characterized}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> baleen, a sieve-like structure in the upper jaw made of keratin, which it uses to filter plankton, among others, from the water; Odontocetes (toothed whales) are characterized by bearing sharp teeth for hunting, as opposed to their counterparts' baleen.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{the cane}} toad closely resembles many bufonid species. In particular, {{it could be}} {{confused}} with the southern toad (Bufo terrestris), which can be distinguished <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> two bulbs in front of the parotoid glands.|$|E
5|$|Like Pluto, Makemake appears red in {{the visible}} spectrum, and {{significantly}} redder than the surface of Eris (see colour comparison of TNOs).

5|$|Although {{dopamine}} {{is normally}} {{broken down by}} an oxidoreductase enzyme, it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen, yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products.

Ante-mortem fractures will show signs of healing while peri- and post-mortem fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle.
