5|$|Adams {{was sworn}} into office as the nation's second {{president}} on March 4, 1797, by Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth. As president, he followed Washington's lead {{in using the}} presidency to exemplify republican values and civic virtue; and his service was free of scandal. He continued to strengthen the central government <b>by</b> <b>expanding</b> the Navy and Army. In July 1798 Adams signed into law the Act for the Relief of Sick and Disabled Seamen, which authorized {{the establishment of a}} government-operated marine hospital service.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} $40million {{marketing the}} Classic to first-time buyers, Apple had difficulty meeting the high demand. Apple doubled its manufacturing space in 1990 <b>by</b> <b>expanding</b> its Singapore and Cork, Ireland factories, where the Classic was assembled. Air freight, rather than sea shipping, {{was used to}} speed delivery. The shortage caused concern among dealers, who blamed Apple's poor business planning.|$|E
5|$|During the Renaissance, {{money and}} art went hand in hand. Artists {{depended}} entirely on patrons while the patrons needed money to foster artistic talent. Wealth {{was brought to}} Italy in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries <b>by</b> <b>expanding</b> trade into Asia and Europe. Silver mining in Tyrol increased the flow of money. Luxuries from the Eastern world, brought home during the Crusades, increased the prosperity of Genoa and Venice.|$|E

Despite the expansion of its container capabilities and the addition of two massive new cranes, the port went from 9th largest to the 12th largest by tonnage in the nation from 2008 to 2010.|$|E
5|$|On 17 July, the RSK and the VRS militaries started Operation Sword-95, a push {{to capture}} Bihać <b>by</b> <b>expanding</b> on gains made during Operation Spider. The move {{provided}} the HV {{with a chance}} to extend their territorial gains from Operation Winter '94 by advancing from the Livno Valley. On 22 July, President of Croatia Franjo Tuđman and President of Bosnia and Herzegovina Alija Izetbegović signed the Split Agreement on mutual defence, permitting the large-scale deployment of the HV in Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E

5|$|The pygmy {{blue whale}} formed from a founder group of Antarctic blue whales about 20,000 years ago, around the Last Glacial Maximum. This is likely because blue whales were driven north <b>by</b> <b>expanding</b> ice, {{and some have}} stayed there ever since. The pygmy blue whale's {{evolutionarily}} recent origins cause it to have a relatively low genetic diversity.|$|E

5|$|The {{sea onion}} Paranthus rapiformis lives on subtidal mud flats and burrows into the sediment, holding itself in place <b>by</b> <b>expanding</b> its basal disc {{to form an}} anchor. If it gets washed out of its burrow by strong currents, it {{contracts}} into a pearly glistening ball which rolls about. Tube-dwelling anemones which live in parchment-like tubes, are in the anthozoan subclass Ceriantharia, and are only distantly related to sea anemones.|$|E
5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome <b>by</b> <b>expanding</b> the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E
5|$|Although once {{dominated}} by large public and multilateral underwriters, private insurance firms accounted for {{approximately half of}} the political risk insurance market in 2007. As a result, MIGA has paid closer attention to exceptionally risky countries that have little appeal to foreign investors, and has insured projects among nations in the global south. MIGA conducted a survey in 2010 which showed that political risk is the most important deterrent of long-term foreign direct investment in developing countries, even more than economic uncertainty and poor public infrastructure. MIGA's Council of Governors amended the agency's convention in 2010 in an attempt to improve the organization's effectiveness <b>by</b> <b>expanding</b> the range of investments eligible for political risk insurance.|$|E

Complications include uterine contractions, which may occur because dehydration causes body release of ADH, {{which is similar}} to oxytocin in structure. Oxytocin itself can cause uterine contractions and thus ADH can cross-react with oxytocin receptors and cause contractions.|$|R
5|$|British Railways {{announced}} a complete rebuild of Euston that could accommodate a fully electrified West Coast Main Line in 1959. Because of the restricted layout of track and tunnels {{at the northern}} end, enlargement could be accomplished only <b>by</b> <b>expanding</b> southwards over the area occupied by the Great Hall and the Arch. Consequently, the London County Council were given notice that the Arch and the Great Hall would be demolished, which was granted on the proviso that the Arch would be restored and re-sited. This was financially unviable as BR estimated it would cost at least £190,000 (now £).|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{set out a}} {{detailed}} study of common descent with modifications <b>by</b> <b>expanding</b> {{on the theme of}} coevolution between local populations of insects and flowering plants that he had briefly discussed in On the Origin of Species. He examined numerous ways in which orchids vary, showing how they had diverged and developed specialised pollen-dispersal mechanisms. The intricate morphology and anatomy of each flower was carefully described. Apparently trivial details were examined in relation to natural selection to demonstrate how slight variations in similar structures of closely related flowers led to specialised modifications that provided various pollinators (insects) with different ways to cross-fertilise. The mass of descriptive detail was a great achievement, but the result is demanding to read.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{responded to}} the French and Angevin threat <b>by</b> <b>expanding</b> his own network of {{supporters}} beyond the Norman borders. Some Norman barons deemed unreliable were arrested or dispossessed, and Henry used their forfeited estates to bribe his potential allies in the neighbouring territories, in particular Maine. Around 1110, Henry attempted to arrest the young William Clito, but William's mentors moved him {{to the safety of}} Flanders before he could be taken. At about this time, Henry probably began to style himself as the Duke of Normandy. Robert of Bellême turned against Henry once again, and when he appeared at Henry's court in 1112 in a new role as a French ambassador, he was arrested and imprisoned.|$|E

5|$|In {{political}} terms, {{the practical}} benefits were minimal, the dangers considerable. Less than 2% of Scots were professed Catholics {{who already had}} considerable freedom to practice in private, a point made by James himself. The opening of Catholic chapels in Edinburgh allowing public celebration of the Mass led to riots and made private worship more difficult. Attempts to build support <b>by</b> <b>expanding</b> the measures benefitted dissident Presbyterians while undermining his Episcopalian base. When James failed to get Parliament's approval, he confirmed popular prejudice linking Catholicism and arbitrary rule by using the Royal Prerogative to promote Catholics to key government positions.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecophilous (ant-loving) {{caterpillars}} of {{the butterfly}} family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding {{areas in the}} daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them. Some caterpillars produce vibrations and sounds that are perceived by the ants. A similar adaptation {{can be seen in}} Grizzled skipper butterflies that emit vibrations <b>by</b> <b>expanding</b> their wings in order to communicate with ants, which are natural predators of these butterflies. Other caterpillars have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes the ants act as if the caterpillar is one of their own larvae. The caterpillar is then taken into the ant nest where it feeds on the ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Reserve publishes data on {{premature}} death rates by county, {{defined as those}} dying below age 74. According to the Kaiser Foundation, expanding Medicaid in the remaining 19 states would cover up to 4.5 million persons.
