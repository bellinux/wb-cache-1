5|$|After the battle, Julian was {{acclaimed}} as Augustus (co-emperor) by his troops, but he vehemently {{refused the}} title, which could only legally be bestowed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> Augustus, Constantius. Given the latter's murderous attitude against potential contenders, Julian's caution is understandable, although it bought him no credit with Constantius.|$|E
5|$|During the 1995 {{parliamentary}} elections most opposition parties, including the ZUM, boycotted the voting, {{resulting in a}} near-sweep <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> party. When the opposition returned {{to the polls in}} 2000, they won 57 seats, only five fewer than ZANU.|$|E

Although Japan was placed under {{isolation}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> Tokugawa shogunate, Hyogo Port remained an important route for domestic trade. Given its importance, Hyogo Port was under the direct administration of the Shogunate via the Osaka machi-bugyō.|$|E

2500|$|Very {{generally}} speaking, Canada's {{court system}} is a four-level hierarchy as shown below from highest to lowest in terms of legal authority. Each court is bound <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rulings</b> of <b>the</b> courts above them; however, they are not bound <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rulings</b> of other courts {{at the same level}} in the hierarchy. [...] Civil courts in Quebec, in particular, are under no obligation to apply judicial precedent—the principle of stare decisis—which is the general rule elsewhere in Canada. [...] This is because Quebec's civil law is entirely codified, while civil law in the other nine provinces grew out of the English common law.|$|R
5|$|Alessandro Farnese, as Paul III, was {{the last}} of the popes {{appointed}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> Medici family of Florence. He was socially ambitious, a careerist and not particularly pious. He kept a concubine, fathered four children out of wedlock and viewed the throne as an opportunity to fill his coffers while he placed his relatives in high positions. A talented and cunning political operator, Paul was precisely the sort of man the Florentines needed to assist them in their defence against French and Spanish threats.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, the {{geography}} dictated a dispersed economy and population. As a result, the traditional Norwegian farm culture remained strong, and Norway differed from most European countries in never adopting feudalism. This, {{combined with the}} ready availability of wood as a building material, ensured that relatively few examples of the Baroque, Renaissance, and Rococo architecture styles so often built <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> classes elsewhere in Europe, were constructed in Norway.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 Weizsäcker was the Presidential {{candidate}} {{of his party}} for the first time, but he lost to Walter Scheel of the FDP, who was supported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> center-left coalition. Ahead of the 1976 elections, CDU chairman Helmut Kohl included him in his shadow cabinet for the party’s campaign to unseat incumbent Helmut Schmidt as chancellor. Between 1979 and 1981, Weizsäcker served as Vice President of the Bundestag.|$|E

5|$|Pedro Afonso's {{death from}} fever {{at the age}} of one devastated the Emperor, and the {{imperial}} couple had no further children. Pedro Afonso's older sister Dona Isabel became heiress, but PedroII was unconvinced that a woman could ever be accepted as monarch <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> elite. He excluded Isabel from matters of state and failed to provide training for her possible role as empress. With no surviving male children, the Emperor started to believe that the imperial line was destined to end with his own death.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarian Orthodox Church decisively {{opposed the}} charges against Joachim III and {{considered}} the emperor's actions personal vengeance. It included {{his name in the}} list of the Patriarchs, preserved in the Book of Boril, and mentioned him in the liturgies. The litanies in his honour indicate that Joachim III was remembered with respect in the Church. He was the second Bulgarian Patriarch executed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> monarch after Vissarion, condemned by Ivan Asen II (r. 1218–1241) after refusing to bless his third marriage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, Middle Scots, often simply called English, became the {{dominant}} {{language of the}} country. It was derived largely from Old English, {{with the addition of}} elements from Gaelic and French. Although resembling the language spoken in northern England, it became a distinct dialect from the late fourteenth century onwards. It began to be adopted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> elite as they gradually abandoned French. By the fifteenth century it was the language of government, with acts of parliament, council records and treasurer's accounts almost all using it from the reign of James I onwards. As a result, Gaelic, once dominant north of the Tay, began a steady decline. Lowland writers began to treat Gaelic as a second class, rustic and even amusing language, helping to frame attitudes towards the highlands and to create a cultural gulf with the lowlands.|$|E

The Crystal is kept in a special chamber within the Royal Citadel, its powers only accessible through the hereditary Ring of the Lucii.

5|$|Millhouse was a vocal {{advocate}} of his broader constituency, championing their {{case in a}} party dominated by rural conservatives. He {{wrote a paper on}} the 'Liberal Case for Electoral Reform', arguing for a fairer electoral system, as it was biased against voters resident in the capital city, Adelaide, whether they be progressive or conservative, Liberal or Labor. Many younger urban middle class voters, who would have normally been attracted to the LCL, were abandoning the party for Labor owing to their dissatisfaction with the malapportioned electoral system known as the 'Playmander'. But this concerned the rural conservatives little, who hoped to retain their hold on power through the present system, which included a Legislative Council where suffrage was based on land ownership, resulting in a body dominated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> class and the rural landholders, and a 16–4 LCL majority. Millhouse's paper was quickly ignored.|$|E

5|$|The {{usefulness}} of the Great Wall as a defence line against northern nomads became questionable under the Qing dynasty, since their territory encompassed vast areas {{inside and outside the}} wall: China proper, Manchuria, and Mongolia were all under Qing control. So instead, the Great Wall became the means to limit Han Chinese movement into the steppes. In the case of Manchuria, considered to be the sacred homeland <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> Manchu elites, some parts of the Ming Liaodong Wall were repaired so it could serve to control Han Chinese movement into Manchuria alongside the newly erected Willow Palisade.|$|E
5|$|When South Africa {{became a}} {{republic}} in 1961, the flag remained the same. The Afrikaner voting majority disliked the flag retaining the Union Jack in the centre.

Vorster convened a commission in that year to create a new flag in time for the 10th anniversary of South Africa's declaration of independence in 1971, but no changes were eventually made. The flag was treated with respect by Afrikaners with daily flag salutes in schools. It was also used as part of celebrations of the inauguration of the State President.|$|E
