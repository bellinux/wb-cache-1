Towards the end of 1990 Trillium became focused on developing its own products.|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjective:To analyze {{findings}} and acute changes in electrocorticograms (ECoGs) obtained during corpus callosotomy {{in order to}} identify any relationships with the postoperative outcome of seizure activity. Methods:We retrospectively analyzed ECoGs obtained during anterior callosotomy (4 – 6 cm) in 48 patients with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (32 boys and 16 girls, age 1 – 20 years, mean age 7. 6 years) who underwent surgery between July 1993 and November 1996 to correlate recording findings with postoperative seizure activity. At the time of analysis, all patients had been followed postoperatively for more than 4 years. Results:Of 48 patients, 31 (64. 6 %) had significant improvement in seizure control after surgery. In pre-excisional ECoGs, 38 (79. 2 %) of 48 patients had <b>bisynchronous</b> epileptiform discharges. Patients (23 of 33 patients, 69. 7 %) with significant blockage of <b>bisynchronous</b> discharges recorded during callosotomy achieved the best postoperative seizure outcomes, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P> 0. 05). Conclusions:Based on our experience, changes in ECoG during callosotomy do not predict postoperative seizure outcome. Insignificant blockage of <b>bisynchronous</b> epileptiform discharges in ECoGs during callosotomy does not predict a worse prognosis than that associated with significant intraoperative blockage...|$|E

Concurrent BIST operations {{are carried out}} after reset at each switch, thus resulting in scalable test application time with network size. The key principle consists of exploiting the inherent structural redundancy of the NoC architecture in a cooperative way for the effective diagnosis and error detection. At-speed testing of stuck-at faults can be performed in less than 4000 cycles regardless of their size, with an hardware overhead of less than 30 %...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{distribution}} of a synchronous clock in system-on-chip (SoC) {{has become a}} problem, because of wire length and process variation. Novel approaches such as the globally asynchronous, locally synchronous try {{to solve this issue}} by partitioning the SoC into isolated synchronous islands. This paper describes the <b>bisynchronous</b> FIFO used on the DSPIN network-on-chip capable to interface systems working with different clock signals (frequency and/or phase). Its interfaces are synchronous and its architecture is scalable and synthesizable in synchronous standard cells. The metastability situations and its latency are analyzed. Its throughput, maximum frequency, and area are evaluated in function of the FIFO depth...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroductionVagus nerve {{stimulation}} (VNS) {{is an effective}} alternative treatment for patients with partial refractory epilepsy. Nevertheless, information regarding VNS in children is still limited. Materials and methodsThe clinical efficacy, safety and neuropsychological effects of VNS in 34 children (mean age 11. 5 years) with drug-resistant epilepsy were studied. Mean follow-up was 30. 8 months. Nine patients {{have been diagnosed with}} Lennox–Gastaut Syndrome, nine patients were affected by severe partial epilepsy with <b>bisynchronous</b> EEG and drop attacks, and 16 patients suffered from partial epilepsy without <b>bisynchronous</b> EEG and fall seizures. Forms were designed for prospective data collection on each patient's history, seizures, implants, device settings, quality of life (QOL), neuropsychological assessment and adverse events. Surgical technique was performed both by standard two incisions and single neck incision. ResultsMean reduction in total seizures was 39 % at 3 months, 38 % at 6 months, 49 % at 12 months, 61 % at 24 months and 71 % at 36 months. Significant better results were obtained in partial epilepsy, with and without drop attacks, than in Lennox–Gastaut syndrome—three patients being seizure-free. No operative morbidity was reported. Side-effects were minor and transient—the most common were voice alteration and coughing during stimulation. In two patients, electrode breakage occurred 3 years after surgical procedure; in both cases, a new device was implanted after removing the vagal electrode coils and generator. ConclusionVNS can be considered an appropriate strategy as an add-on treatment in children affected by drug-resistant partial epilepsy and ineligible for resective epilepsy surgery...|$|E
40|$|Output {{connections}} to out-of-chip devices in modern mixed-signal ICs represent a significant design problem {{due to the}} limited number of available pins (in not Ball Grid Array package) and to the common need of a frequency reduction, especially into systems that require an external System on Programmable Chip (SoPC). In this paper, an ASIC solution based on <b>bisynchronous</b> FIFO structures for frequency conversion is presented. The proposed bridge involves a custom protocol for the conversion of the transmitted data in low frequency and low width bus. Moreover, it allows managing data transmission with two different priority levels. The module is AHB lite compliant with a number of pins equal to the width of the FIFOs (configurable during implementation phase) and two handshaking signals. Output clock frequency and internal FIFOs dimension are user-defined too...|$|E
40|$|A 20 -year-old woman {{underwent}} sleep-deprived EEG (figure) {{for evaluation}} of possible seizure disor-der. Interpret the EEG finding. ANSWER This longitudinal bipolar montage (figure) shows initial 8 – 9 /second, 55 -mV posterior background rhythm. In {{the portion of the}} record underscored by a solid black line, characteristic <b>bisynchronous</b> burst of occipitally predominant, up to 40 mV (average 27 mV), 6 /second spike-and-wave complexes occurs for 0. 5 second. Preceding and following this asymmetric low-amplitude burst, the drowsy state is reflected as a dropout. The pattern of 6 /second phantom spike-and-waves observed in this young woman is termed FOLD (female, occipital, low-amplitude spike, and drowsy). 1 This rare and benign EEG finding should not be mistaken for epileptiform discharges. 1 The other variant, WHAM (waking, high-amplitude spike, anterior, male), might transiently impair cognition and has a higher rate of frequency of epilepsy. ...|$|E
40|$|Partial or {{complete}} corpus callosotomies have been applied, traditionally via open surgical or radiosurgical approaches, {{for the treatment}} of epilepsy in patients with multifocal tonic, atonic, or myoclonic seizures. Minimally invasive methods, such as MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal ablation (MTLA), are being employed to functionally remove or ablate seizure foci in the treatment of epilepsy. This therapy can achieve effectiveness similar to that of traditional resection, but with reduced morbidity compared with open surgery. Here, we present a patient with a history of prior partial corpus callosotomy who continued to suffer from medically refractory epilepsy with <b>bisynchronous</b> onset. We report on the utilization of laser ablation of the splenium in this patient to achieve full corpus callosotomy. Adequate ablation of the splenial remnant was confirmed by postoperative MRI imaging, and at four-month follow-up, the patient's seizure frequency had dropped more than 50 %. This is the first reported instance of laser ablation of the splenium to achieve full corpus callosotomy following a previous unsuccessful anterior callosotomy in a patient with intractable generalized epilepsy...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{girls with}} Rett {{syndrome}} had 22 electroencephalographic studies performed over 5 years. Nineteen waking tracings demonstrated moderate background slowing. Focal epileptiform activity {{was observed in}} 13 studies, 10 of which had bilateral independent foci. Spikes were invariably maximal in central regions, diphasic or triphasic, and of very short duration. In 3 patients, epileptiform activity preceded clinical seizures by up to 2 years. Two children had spontaneous hyperpnea preceding apnea during wakefulness with further background slowing. Video monitoring of 2 children revealed that episodic behavioral changes were not seizures. Ten of 12 sleep recordings had abnormal background activity with absent or rudimentary spindles. Normal activity occurred only in girls younger than years of age. Epileptiform activity was markedly increased during sleep in 8 tracings in which both wakefulness and sleep were obtained. It was characterized by bilaterally independent and <b>bisynchronous</b> spike-and-wave activity, maximal in parasagittal areas. One patient had bursts of high-voltage slow-wave activity followed by attenuation. No apneic episodes were recorded during sleep. In Rett syndrome, electroencephalographic abnormalities include background slowing, centrally located short-duration spikes, and increased epileptiform activity during sleep. This activity commonly preceded clinical seizures in patients studied at initial presentation...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{topographic}} relationships between cortical and subcortical lesions shown on magnetic resonance images (MRI) {{and sources of}} epileptiform activity {{in a series of}} nine children with intractable epilepsy and tuberous sclerosis complex. Although video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring was suggestive of a frontal seizure onset, interictal EEG was, in seven of nine cases, in the form of apparently <b>bisynchronous</b> discharges. In all cases, the use of a short time lag estimation procedure based on a nonlinear correlation function between surface recorded EEG signals allowed the detection of a lateralized onset of EEG paroxysmal activity. Furthermore, a computerized method based on a source local-ization EEG-MRI image fusioning procedure, has revealed a topographic concordance between well-defmed frontal cortical lesions shown on MRI and site of onset of paroxysmal discharges. Lennox-like EEG patterns frequently reported in chil-dren with tuberous sclerosis complex could be the result of the tendency of frontal tubers to induce secondary bilateral synchrony, with implications in the medical and eventually surgical management of the often drug-resistant associated seizures. (J Child Neurol 1998; 13 : 33 - 38). Seizures are very common among individuals with tuber-ous sclerosis complex, being reported up to 92 % in a large clinical series. They tend to exhibit the characteristics o...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{evaluate}} {{the value of}} a new multi-stage surgical procedure using bilateral intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) prior and post complete corpus callosotomy (CC) for epileptogenic focus localization. MethodThirty patients with drug-resistant epilepsy underwent bilateral iEEG monitoring to localize epileptogenic focus for surgical treatment. Among them, <b>bisynchronous</b> epileptogenic activities were found in 9 pediatric patients. These 9 patients then received complete CC and continued bilateral iEEG monitoring for further seizure localization. Final surgical treatment decisions were made based on the bilateral iEEG findings post complete CC. The entire multi-stage procedure was performed during the same hospital stay. We retrospectively studied the data from the 9 patients. ResultsSeizure onset was lateralized in 3 patients who later received functional hemispherectomy. In another 4 patients, seizure onset was localized, resulting in resective surgery. Bilateral multiple subpial transection was performed on 1 patient with identified bilateral independent seizure onset. One patient did not have seizures following complete CC leading to removal of electrodes without any further resection. Subsequent follow-up showed favorable outcome in all patients: seizure-free in 7, more than 90 % reduction in 2. None of the patients experienced surgery related complications during the procedure and follow-up period. ConclusionThe multi-stage surgical procedure utilizing iEEG monitoring with CC is a viable option for select patients with catastrophic non-localizing epilepsy. Further study is necessary to find the optimal selection criteria for use of this novel approach...|$|E
