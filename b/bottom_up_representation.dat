The Case of Tanzania May co-operative organisations be said to perform a role of any importance in processes of democratisation? The objective of my thesis is {{to answer this question}} theoretically and to illustrate with the case of Tanzania. It can thus be formulated in two parts; one theoretical and one empirical; May co-operative organisations {{contribute to a}} process of democratisation? Do co-operative organisations contribute to the process of democratisation in Tanzania? To answer the first question I investigate to what extent co-operative theory is compatible with a theory of how organisations in civil society may contribute to democratic development. By amalgamating the two theories I produce a five-featured theoretical framework which structures the empirical research to be done in Tanzania. Tanzanian recent history presents us with two contrasting periods to compare; One of a one-party regime where the state demands complete control of co-operative affairs, from 1982 to 1991, and one of a multiparty system where co-operatives are left almost entirely to themselves by the government, from 1992 until today. Focus of the study lies with the recent developments, i. e. with the post 1992 period, but in order to analyse this period it is necessary {{to take into account the}} historical background of the co-operative movement in Tanzania. After almost thirty years of one-party rule Tanzania introduced a multiparty government in 1992 and at the same time a new co-operative act was initiated in the country, based on the co-operative principles agreed upon by the International Co-operative Alliance. Because I in this thesis wish to examine factors which contribute to democratic development, rather than discuss the entire process of democratisation, I will not try to measure this process. Any change in the polity which brings society closer to the definitions of democracy presented above may be regarded as a contribution to democratic development of that society. The following five features comprise my theoretical framework. It guides my empirical research of the two periods as well as the ensuing analysis. State - Co-operative Relationship Organisational Institutionalisation Internal Democracy Co-operative Structure and Position in Society Empowerment of Members The five-featured model is based on Larry Diamond s article in Journal of Democracy Vol. 5, No. 3 : Rethinking Civil Society. Toward Democratic Consolidation, and on Co-operative values and Principles as these have been formulated by the International Co-operative Alliance. My empirical investigation shows that there have been drastic changes in the Tanzanian government declarations concerning official policy on co-operative organisations since the beginning of the 1990 s. Governments dedication to help rebuild an independent and forceful co-operative movement has proved to last and it has even become more credible with follow up enactments. The co-operative sector has also, since 1991, had to deal with competition from private traders, as the protection given by government-granted monopoly status was removed. It is difficult to establish whether the restructuring of the co-operative sector following the 1991 Act is a result of deliberate measures on the part of the government, or the inevitable result of other liberalisation policies. But, the fact is that the co-operative sector has become more pluralistic as there are no longer restrictions on participation or type of co-operative which may be established. Many co-operatives have withered away, some have amalgamated and others have split into sub-units. With the introduction of the four-tiered hierarchic structure, <b>bottom</b> <b>up</b> <b>representation</b> of co-operative members interests is thought to be established. Some evidence of renewed interest in the co-operative solution has been found, especially in fertile areas and in the establishment of pre-co-operatives by women. But people are definitely hesitant. The legacy of the past is still strong within the co-operative movement. The ruling party still has a footing at all co-operative levels. One of the most striking anomalies to co-operative democratic rule is the continued absence of women in decision making positions. There is reluctance to implement the 1991 Act, even among national level politicians, even seven years after it was enacted. The Co-operative Department seems to be eager to implement, however. It is difficult to measure the impact of such laxity on the general status of the co-operative sector in society. On one hand, the unhurried process allows for people to catch up and prepare for change, on the other hand it undermines the credibility of the government...|$|E
40|$|This {{article has}} {{as a central}} concern the {{unpacking}} of New Zealand Anzac identities at war by reference to other British army formations during World War I, notably the English and the Australians {{both of whom were}} an important benchmark in the construction of New Zealand identities. By juxtaposing the traditional top down view with <b>bottom</b> <b>up</b> <b>representations</b> of New Zealanders at war two contradictory narratives are laid bare. It is argued that <b>bottom</b> <b>up</b> <b>representations</b> have some significant resonances with Australian Anzac narratives of the war. The aim of the article is to bridge separate national Anzac traditions through an historiographical synthesis that focuses on encounters at war as well as distinctive home front factors influencing understandings of the wartime experience...|$|R

Gaifman models learn feature <b>representations</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>up</b> from <b>representations</b> of locally connected and bounded-size regions of knowledge bases (KBs). Considering local and bounded-size neighborhoods of knowledge bases renders logical inference and learning tractable, mitigates {{the problem of}} overfitting, and facilitates weight sharing. Gaifman models sample neighborhoods of knowledge bases {{so as to make}} the learned relational models more robust to missing objects and relations which is a common situation in open-world KBs. We present the core ideas of Gaifman models and apply them to large-scale relational learning problems. We also discuss the ways in which Gaifman models relate to some existing relational machine learning approaches. Comment: NIPS 201...|$|R

This paper discusses one technique that became known as “blobology” and {{which is used to}} represent s lf-reporting friendly forces. Blobs evolved over time, in a collaboration with subject matter experts, and this evolution is shown. The experience gained, as these representations were iteratively developed and tested since the program began in 1999, is reviewed.

40|$|Diffuse interreflections {{mean that}} surface shading and shape are related {{in ways that}} are {{difficult}} to untangle; in particular, distant and invisible surfaces may affect the shading field that one sees. The effects of distant surfaces are confined to relatively low spatial frequencies in the shading field, meaning that we can expect signatures, called shading primitives, corresponding to shape properties. We demonstrate how these primitives can be used to support the construction of useful shape representations. Approaches to this include testing hypotheses of geometric primitives for consistency with the shading field, and looking for shading events that are distinctive of some shape event. We show that these approaches can be composed, leading to an attractive process of representation that is intrinsically <b>bottom</b> <b>up.</b> This <b>representation</b> can be extracted from images of real scenes, and that the representation is diagnostic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a symbolic time series representation using monotonic sub-sequences and <b>bottom</b> <b>up</b> segmentation. The <b>representation</b> min-imizes the square error between the segments and their monotonic approximations. The representation can robustly classify {{the direction of}} a segment and is scale in-variant with respect to the time and value dimensions. This paper describes two experiments. The first shows how accurately the monotonic functions are able to discriminate between different segments. The second tests how well the segmenta-tion technique recognizes segments and classifies them with correct symbols. Fi-nally this paper illustrates the new representation on real-world data. ...|$|R

A phenomenon which is rarely touched upon {{is that of the}} difficult employee in a subordinate position who directs his or her workplace incivility towards the manager (in this paper referred to as the <b>Bottom</b> <b>Up</b> Employee). Eight managers were interviewed to gather and present qualitative data on the perceptions by mangers of a difficult employee within the workplace, the direct psychological impacts on coworkers and managers and the indirect psychological impacts on innocent bystanders caused by the constant contact or indirect relationship with the <b>Bottom</b> <b>Up</b> Employee, respectively, and the best practices to employ within an organization to handle the <b>Bottom</b> <b>up</b> Employee. The results of the interviews confirmed the existence of the <b>Bottom</b> <b>Up</b> Employee and the devastating impacts he or she can have on the manager. The consensus from those managers who dealt firsthand with the <b>Bottom</b> <b>Up</b> Employee was to dismiss rather than to retain the <b>Bottom</b> <b>Up</b> Employee.
