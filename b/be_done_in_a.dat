5|$|German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer criticised Kant's {{belief that}} ethics should concern {{what ought to}} be done, insisting that the scope of ethics should be to attempt to explain and {{interpret}} what actually happens. Whereas Kant presented an idealized version of what ought to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> perfect world, Schopenhauer argued that ethics should instead be practical and arrive at conclusions that could work in the real world, capable of being presented as a solution to the world's problems. Schopenhauer drew a parallel with aesthetics, arguing that in both cases prescriptive rules are not {{the most important part of}} the discipline. Because he believed that virtue cannot be taught—a person is either virtuous or is not—he cast the proper place of morality as restraining and guiding people's behavior, rather than presenting unattainable universal laws.|$|E

25|$|Current {{versions}} of Btrieve support system transactions and user transactions, where system transactions are {{a bundle of}} non-transactional operations and/or user transactions, whereas user transactions are transactions that work on actual data in the database. System transactions were developed to allow multiple transactions to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> batch and to make data recovery easier.|$|E
25|$|I {{suppose the}} day is not far distant when the players will also fly out to Australia, and this can <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> week or even less, as {{evidenced}} by the experiences of Cyril Washbrook, Roy Tattersall and Brian Statham, who left home one week and were in Australia the next.|$|E
25|$|These two {{concepts}} of infinity and reality {{lie at the}} heart of Unger's program calling for metaphysical and institutional revolutions. From the concept of the self as infinite but constrained, Unger argues that we must continually transform our environment to better express ourselves. This can only <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> singular world within which time is real.|$|E

25|$|The dog must {{separate}} the group {{into two groups}} in a controlled way {{in accordance with the}} instructions from the judge. This may involve some sheep being marked and the dog and handler working together to {{separate the}}m from the rest or some variation of that. This is known as shedding and is almost always required to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ring marked out on the ground.|$|E
25|$|Determining {{which side}} of the seal should face up may <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of ways: if there is a carving on top, the front should face the user; if there is an {{inscription}} on the side, it should face {{to the left of the}} user; if there is a dot on the side, it should face away from the user.|$|E
25|$|Each member {{could get}} a chance to speak through {{assignment}} of the floor and debate. Debate may be limited in the number of speeches and time and should be respectful to others at all times. Voting takes place to decide the course of action and it could <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> multitude of ways, such as voice vote, standing vote, and ballot vote.|$|E

25|$|Typical surfing {{instruction}} is best performed one-on-one, {{but can also}} <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> group setting. The most popular surf locations offer perfect surfing conditions for beginners, as well as challenging breaks for advanced students. The ideal conditions for learning would be small waves that crumble and break softly, {{as opposed to the}} steep, fast-peeling waves desired by more experienced surfers. When available, a sandy seabed is generally safer.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards, the Credible Hawks and new UH-60As were {{upgraded}} and designated MH-60G Pave Hawk. These upgrades were to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> two-step process. However, funding {{allowed only}} 16 Credible Hawks {{to receive the}} second step equipment. These helicopters were allocated to special operations use. The remaining 82 Credible Hawks received the first step upgrade equipment and were used for combat search and rescue. In 1991, these search and rescue Pave Hawks were redesignated HH-60G.|$|E
25|$|A {{bone marrow}} biopsy may <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> health care provider's office or in a hospital. Informed consent for the {{procedure}} is typically required. The patient is asked to lie on their abdomen (prone position) or on their side (lateral decubitus position). The skin is cleansed, and a local anesthetic such as lidocaine or procaine is injected to numb the area. Patients may also be pretreated with analgesics and/or anti-anxiety medications, although {{this is not a}} routine practice.|$|E

25|$|On October 1, {{the day of}} {{the first}} debate, it was {{announced}} that both debates would get extended time, from 12 to 30 minutes, for the economy, and leaders would not give opening and closing statements, to allow for longer discussions on the economy without removing time from other topics. It was also revealed that instead of leaders standing at individual podiums for the debate, as had been done in past years, the debate would <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> round table format.|$|E
25|$|Eric Hehner and Nigel Horspool {{proposed}} in 1979 {{the use of}} a -adic representation for rational numbers on computers called Quote notation. The primary advantage of such a representation is that addition, subtraction, and multiplication can <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> straightforward manner analogous to similar methods for binary integers; and division is even simpler, resembling multiplication. However, it has the disadvantage that representations can be much larger than simply storing the numerator and denominator in binary (for more details see Quote notation#Length of representation).|$|E
25|$|In Bolivia, all {{medical schools}} are faculties within a {{university}} {{and offer a}} five-year M.D. equivalent. To acquire a license to exercise medical science from the government, all students must also complete 1 year and 3 months of internship. This consists of 3 months each of surgery, internal medicine, gynecology, pediatrics and public health. At {{least one of the}} internships must <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rural area of the country. After getting the degree and license, a doctor may take a post-graduate residency in order to acquire a specialty.|$|E

25|$|Implants, as {{subcutaneous}} pellets, {{can be used}} {{to deliver}} testosterone (brand name Testopel). 6 to 12 pellets are inserted under the skin every three months. This must <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> physician's office, but is a relatively minor procedure done under local anesthetic. Pellets cost about $60 each, so the cost is greater than injected testosterone when the cost of the physician visit and procedure are included. The primary advantages of Testopel are that it gives a much more constant blood level of testosterone yet requires attention only four times yearly.|$|E
25|$|No {{official}} {{attempts to}} create an orthography have been made, nevertheless there are countless short stories, poems and songs written in Erzgebirgisch. The Sächsischer Heimatverein guidelines to writing in Erzgebirgisch were established in 1937, but are by and large not respected {{by the majority of}} authors. This means that linguistic analysis of this dialect has to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> field work setting with native speakers. An additional threat to Erzgebirgisch is the popular misconception that Erzgebirgisch was a hillbilly variety of Saxonian, which does not help the conservation efforts.|$|E
25|$|View of a German {{minority}} {{as potentially}} troublesome: From the Soviet perspective, {{shared by the}} communist administrations installed in Soviet-occupied Europe, the remaining large German populations outside postwar Germany were seen as a potentially troublesome 'fifth column' that would, because of its social structure, interfere with the envisioned Sovietisation of the respective countries. The Western allies also saw {{the threat of a}} potential German 'fifth column', especially in Poland after the agreed-to compensation with former German territory. In general, the Western allies hoped to secure a more lasting peace by eliminating the German minorities, which they thought could <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> humane manner.|$|E
50|$|Chestnut Lodge {{would not}} permit filming on {{location}} so those scenes <b>were</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> vacant mansion rented by the production company, Centur Productions, on the North Shore of Long Island (Locust Valley). Location shooting <b>in</b> Maryland <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> private home <b>in</b> Rockville {{as well as in}} the downtown area, plus scenes at Great Falls on both the Maryland and Virginia sides of the Potomac River, as well as a staged carnival scene at Barnesville, Maryland. This was Rossen's last film.|$|R
