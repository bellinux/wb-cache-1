5|$|As {{early as}} {{the second half of}} the 18th century there was little or no new constructions taking place in Tvrđa, and even {{maintenance}} of the fort became a burden.

5|$|Building 28 (Structure 5D-28) is {{an unusual}} <b>building</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of an access {{stairway}} {{on the east side}} of the basal platform. It appears to have been a guardroom controlling access from the east terrace. The chamber originally contained curtained doorways and benches against the walls. The width of the building completely blocked access from the stairway; this forced visitors to pass through the chamber, where their presence could be scrutinised and passage beyond blocked if necessary. This route may have become important when Temple 33 was built, blocking the main access stairway from the Great Plaza. Structure 5D-28 was built very late in the Early Classic period (around the 6th century).|$|E
5|$|By 1907, new {{university}} buildings completely {{surrounded the}} observatory; {{dust from the}} construction clogged meteorological instruments, and at night electric lighting made astronomical work impossible.

There was some discussion regarding {{what to do with the}} Cooke telescope, since the Meteorological Office had little use for this purely astronomical instrument. No other use was immediately forthcoming, and the telescope moved along with the Meteorological Office to their new Bloor Street Observatory.|$|E
