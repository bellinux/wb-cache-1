The main idea {{is to have a}} <b>bio-diesel</b> engine <b>powering</b> the rear wheels and an {{electric}} motor pow-ering the front wheels. The design was simulated and tested to optimize race performance with models that are capable of easy modification for new components...|$|R
5000|$|This {{technology}} {{is also being}} used to make <b>bio-diesel</b> to <b>power</b> cars. Biotech company, Amyris, in Emeryville, California, has applied synthetic biology to yeast. Instead of producing alcohol through the fermentation of sugar, this yeast produces diesel. The amount of diesel that is produced by this method is substantially {{greater than that of}} the conventional method and can exponentially increase the rate of production. This diesel has already been implemented in actual cars, in Brazil.|$|R
