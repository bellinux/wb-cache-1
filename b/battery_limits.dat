30|$|The largest design constraint, however, is {{the limited}} energy budget of a sensor node {{together}} with the requirement of long network runtimes. For instance, having a node continuously powered on drains an AA battery of 3000 mAh in about 4 days [12], which is well below the typically required decade of operation. On the other extreme, even if a node is switched off all the time, inherent current leakages in the <b>battery</b> <b>limits</b> the battery lifetime to 10 - 15 years in dependency of the operating temperature. This renders network lifetime maximization with battery-powered nodes useless if the lifespan goes beyond this number [13]. In typical sensor applications, the energy consumption {{is dominated by the}} node's radio consumption. A prominent example of the current non-optimized WSN deployment is that the start-up alone costs the network a third of its battery power [13, 14]. Based on these constraints for WSN, high efficient network implementation scheme and data collection under power saving mode is essential for practical applications.|$|E

Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET), which is a type of a wireless network, is formed by mobile nodes.

40|$|AbstractThe cost of CO 2 capture {{is a much}} debated question, {{and it is an}} {{important}} issue regarding development of CO 2 capture plants. The gap in the estimates is so large on a global basis, and they exhibit a great variation based on the geographically location, type of capture technology and whether the plant is based on brown coal (lignite), coal or natural gas. This paper identifies some of the reasons for these gaps, and tries to suggest how capture cost estimates can be made more comparable. Comparing different cost estimates is challenging, and there exist no final answers of what should be included or where such a plant should be located. <b>Battery</b> <b>limits</b> varies from estimated to estimates, and often are the assumption not included when a “cost per ton CO 2 ” is presented. Two cost estimates can only be compared when all the assumptions are showed. Some people and institutes try to reduce the cost as much as they can, trying to make CO 2 capture look cheaper than they are, but there are also some groups that would gain on high capture costs. Both ways, the costs is still estimation, and the uncertainty will always be a large question when it comes to cost estimation. But including the assumptions for the estimations is one step forwards to make more comparable cost estimations...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{there has been an}} {{increased}} number of media applications that have migrated to the cloud, which will enable mobile users to engage in rich media experiences from any mobile platform. In this research, we develop techniques to model and enhance the quality of service for two cloud mobile media applications: Cloud Mobile Rendering (CMR) application and HTTP-based adaptive video streaming. In CMR application, compute intensive graphic rendering is performed on cloud servers, and the rendered video is encoded and transmitted through wireless network to mobile devices. Although promising to address the computation and <b>battery</b> <b>limits</b> of mobile devices, this approach suffers from challenges posed by limited and unstable wireless bandwidth, such {{that it is difficult to}} ensure the quality of service. In this research, we first develop a model to quantitatively measure the user experience of CMR application, considering rendering factors, encoding factors and network factors simultaneously. Secondly we derive several techniques to enhance the quality of service, including a) an adaptive rendering technique which dynamically select the optimal rendering factor based on network condition; b) a prioritized encoding technique which allocates bits among different regions of video frame depending on their priorities; c) an encoding acceleration technique which utilizes rendering information to reduce the computation complexity of video encoding while maintaining the video quality. In HTTP-based adaptive video streaming, video content are split into a sequence of small segments, which are encoded into several versions with different bit rates and quality, and streamed according to the requests from streaming client. The version of video segments will keep varying according to the available bandwidth. Flucating bandwidth will lead to temporal artifacts such as video rebuffering (freezing), and spatial artifacts such as visual quality variation. In this thesis, we develop the first user experience model for this application through extensive subjective experiments. We validate with high accuracy the user experience model, and demonstrates its applicability to video with different length and motion characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 Wirelessly powered sensors {{are proven}} as an {{effective}} solution for sensing and monitoring in undeveloped, inaccessible environments or where the difficulty of maintaining devices dramatically increases as the network increases in scale. In addition, small low power consumer electronics, such as wearable sensors, are constrained by the properties of their batteries. The use of a <b>battery</b> <b>limits</b> the device’s lifetime, size, hardware cost and maintenance effort (charging or replacing the battery). Among the latest battery-free solutions, radio frequency (RF) wireless power {{is one of the}} most promising technologies for supplying power, because it not only wirelessly charges passive or semi-passive devices, but also has intrinsic compatibility with existing radio communication systems. This dissertation will discuss a type of RF wirelessly powered system with extremely constrained available power, that leverages existing infrastructure, such as an RFID reader or a cellphone, for its power source. In general, the power available on these wireless devices is around a few uW to a few mW. However, some applications using these devices require power-hungry computing, sensing or communications, which require much more power than is available from RF harvesting. Therefore, the performance attainable for computation, sensing, and communication is significantly affected by energy harvesting efficiency as well as the duty cycle strategy. This dissertation will use a few application examples to demonstrate how RF energy harvesting efficiency affects the performance of wirelessly powered platforms using existing infrastructure with regard to localization, sensing and communication. This dissertation categorizes wireless power systems into two types based on the target operation range and available wireless power level. The first type comprises far-field systems whose operating ranges are beyond a few meters and which support harvested power on the order of a few to hundreds of uW. The second type comprises near field systems whose operating ranges are closer than 10 cm, where the available power is greater than a few mW. The first portion of this thesis addresses the challenges and trade-offs in a far field wirelessly powered sensing system. This dissertation presents a working prototype of an RFID-based system that localizes a custom, battery-free, EPC Gen 2 -compatible UHF tag, and uses it as an example to discuss the typical features of a far-field system. The presented system detects the 3 D position and motion of a battery-free RFID tag incorporating an ultrasound detector and an accelerometer. Combining the tag’s acceleration with absolute 3 D location permits adaptive power management and supports activity recognition. It uses the RFID communication channel for synchronization and inventory, and uses acoustic propagation delays for distance measurement. We characterize the system's localization performance in open space as well as implement it in a smart wet lab application. In the wet lab setting, the system is used to track the real-time location and motion of objects with wireless powered sensing tags, as well as recognize pouring actions performed on the objects to which the tag is attached. This thesis discusses the trade-offs between sensing accuracy, latency, tag power consumption and position. The second portion of this dissertation presents the NFC-WISP as an example of a typical near-field wireless power system. The NFC-WISP is a programmable, computationally enhanced platform designed to explore new near field battery-free sensing and user interface applications. Not only is the NFC-WISP be wirelessly powered and read by commercially available RFID readers (including NFC-enabled smart phones), but the harvested wireless power is sufficient to power external power hungry sensors and peripherals such as an active bistable matrix E-ink display. Firstly, we illustrate possible applications which use the NFC-WISP as a passive display tag, such as a battery-assisted perishable goods temperature display, and a motion monitor with wireless charging features. Secondly, this dissertation discusses how to improve the communication and power harvesting efficiencies by varying the number and the quality factor (Q) of receiver coils. A revision of NFC-WISP is demonstrated with improved communication and energy harvesting performance. Finally, this dissertation discusses how to choose antenna designs to meet the requirements of different systems...|$|E
