40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{capacity of}} polyphenols (+) -catechin, (-) -epicatechin and myricetin, and {{of different types}} of red wines (Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and <b>blended</b> <b>wine)</b> was evaluated by three assays. (a) NADH oxidation by peroxynitrite (ONOO-) : the ONOO- scavenging activity was higher for myricetin (IC 50 = 35 µM) than for (+) -catechin (IC 50 = 275 µM) and (-) -epicatechin (IC 50 = 313 µM). (b) Peroxynitrite initiated chemiluminescence in rat liver homogenate: (-) -epicatechin (IC 50 = 7. 0 µM) and (+) -catechin (IC 50 = 13 µM) were more potent than myricetin (IC 50 = 20 µM) in inhibiting the chemiluminescence signal. (c) Lucigenin chemiluminescence in aortic rings: (-) -epicatechin (IC 50 = 15 µM) and (+) -catechin (IC 50 = 18 µM) showed higher antioxidant capacity than myricetin (IC 50 = 32 µM). All the assayed red wines were able to scavenge the oxidants and free radical species that generate the signal in each assay. Cabernet Sauvignon was the red wine with the highest antioxidant capacity in comparison with Malbec and <b>blended</b> <b>wine.</b> It is concluded that the use of sensitive biological systems (as the aortic ring chemiluminescence) provides important information in addition to the results from chemical (NADH oxidation by peroxynitrite) and biochemical (homogenate chemiluminescence) assays and offers advances in the physiological role of polyphenol...|$|E
