5000|$|<b>Barbiturate</b> <b>dependence</b> {{develops}} {{with regular}} use of barbiturates. This in turn {{may lead to}} a need for increasing doses of the drug to get the original desired pharmacological or therapeutic effect. Barbiturate use can lead to both addiction and physical dependence, and as such they have a high potential for abuse. Management of <b>barbiturate</b> <b>dependence</b> involves considering the affected person's age, comorbidity and the pharmacological pathways of barbiturates. Psychological addiction to barbiturates can develop quickly. The GABAA receptor, one of barbiturates' main sites of action, is thought to play a pivotal {{role in the development of}} tolerance to and dependence on barbiturates, as well as the euphoric [...] "high" [...] that results from their abuse. The mechanism by which barbiturate tolerance develops is believed to be different from that of ethanol or benzodiazepines, even though these drugs have been shown to exhibit cross-tolerance with each other. The management of a physical dependence on barbiturates is stabilisation on the long-acting barbiturate phenobarbital followed by a gradual titration down of dose. The slowly eliminated phenobarbital lessens the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and reduces the chances of serious barbiturate withdrawal effects such as seizures. Antipsychotics are not recommended for barbiturate withdrawal (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{intermittent}} porphyria, hypersensitivity to any <b>barbiturate,</b> prior <b>dependence</b> on <b>barbiturates,</b> severe respiratory insufficiency and hyperkinesia {{in children}} are contraindications for phenobarbital use.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and 1960s, {{increasing}} published reports of <b>barbiturate</b> overdoses and <b>dependence</b> problems led physicians {{to cut back}} their prescription, particularly for spurious requests. This {{eventually led to the}} scheduling of barbiturates as controlled drugs.|$|R
5000|$|Benzodiazepines {{are more}} {{commonly}} administered today for their similar sedative and hypnotic properties, and reduced risk of physical <b>dependence.</b> <b>Barbiturate</b> {{drugs such as}} butabarbital sodium are used now for short-term and acute treatment under strict doctor supervision only ...|$|R
40|$|Dr Wells, {{a general}} practitioner, {{looks at the}} problem of <b>barbiturate</b> <b>dependence</b> {{from the point of}} view of the {{prescribing}} doctor who has to choose for his patients - of all ages - the drug, usually a hypnotic, which is sought for insomnia or states of anxiety and stress. He argues that it is wise to prescribe non-barbiturates, but that even in elderly people it is possible and the right course of action is to wean these patients from their dependence on sleep-inducing drugs. Young people often acquire the drug habit by taking hypnotics from a bedside table or a bathroom cabinet in their own homes...|$|E
40|$|The {{dependence}} on drugs today, particularly by young people, must concern many - doctors and nurses, social workers, lawyers and the police, and parents. The writers {{of the group of}} papers which follow, although inevitably overlapping in some respects, attempt to examine the questions raised from the particular point of view of each. When does taking a drug (generally a barbiturate) become a state of dependence is the question posed and answered by Dr Connell. He begins by setting out the series of offical definitions of addiction, habituation and dependence formulated by the World Health Organization and in Britain by the Interdepartmental Committee (the Brain Committee). With these definitions as a framework he examines <b>barbiturate</b> <b>dependence</b> and abuse in the setting of current medical practice...|$|E
50|$|Isbell and his {{associates}} (including Abraham Wikler) published extensively {{on the effects of}} drugs (including opiates, synthetic opioids, barbiturates, alcohol, amphetamine, ibogaine, multiple psychedelics, and THC) on human subjects, with over 125 publications. Among their experimental results werethe qualitative and quantitative documentation of physical <b>dependence</b> on <b>barbiturates,</b> physical <b>dependence</b> on alcohol, tolerance to amphetamine,investigation and therapeutic use of opiate antagonists (e.g., nalorphine as an overdose treatment),rapid tolerance but lack of physical dependence with LSD, the ability of methadone to alleviate opiate withdrawal symptoms,cross-tolerance between LSD and psilocybin,and the ability of pure THC to cause marijuana-like effects.New pharmaceutical substances were assayed (in the prisoner population) for their abuse and addiction (substance dependence) potential (medications for pain, cough, and diarrhea were of particular concern), and this information was utilized by groups such as the World Health Organization.|$|R
50|$|In September 1952, he {{attempted}} suicide and {{was committed to}} Bellevue Hospital. He was readmitted four months later after suffering a nervous breakdown. After his release, he went on an alcohol and paraldehyde binge during which he wrote six short stories and began writing A Second-Hand Life. In 1953, he checked into an alcoholism clinic and joined Alcoholics Anonymous. Jackson later also spoke about alcoholism to large groups, sharing his experience. A recording of his talk in Cleveland, Ohio in May 1959 is available (vide infra xa-speakers, also YouTube). He was the first speaker in Alcoholics Anonymous to address drug <b>dependence</b> (<b>barbiturates</b> and paraldehyde) openly {{as part of his}} story.|$|R
25|$|There {{are special}} risks to {{consider}} for older adults, {{women who are}} pregnant, and babies. When a person ages, the body becomes less able to rid itself of barbiturates. As a result, people {{over the age of}} sixty-five are at higher risk of experiencing the harmful effects of <b>barbiturates,</b> including drug <b>dependence</b> and accidental overdose. When barbiturates are taken during pregnancy, the drug passes through the placenta to the fetus. After the baby is born, it may experience withdrawal symptoms and have trouble breathing. In addition, nursing mothers who take barbiturates may transmit the drug to their babies through breast milk. A rare adverse reaction to barbiturates is Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which primarily affects the mucous membranes.|$|R
