5|$|Spurs remade for CharlesII {{are taken}} from the altar and {{presented}} to the monarch. They are made of solid gold, richly embossed with floral patterns and scrolls, and have straps of crimson velvet embroidered in gold. Known originally as StGeorge's Spurs, {{they are one of}} the emblems of knighthood and chivalry, and denote the sovereign's role as Commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces. Gold spurs were introduced into the coronation ceremony in 1189 at the coronation of RichardI. Historically, the spurs were fastened to the monarch's feet but since the Restoration they are simply <b>brushed</b> <b>against</b> the heels of kings or shown to queens and placed on the altar.|$|E
5|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} is 231mm (9.09in) {{in length}} and 130mm (5.12in) tall, weighing 880 g (1lb 15oz) unloaded. It has an octagonal barrel, with the foresight blade being embedded directly into the barrel. The rear sight is incorporated {{into the top of}} the frame. A hinged sideplate allows access to the mechanism for lubricating and servicing. The weapon was opened by lifting the top latch, after which the barrel was swung downward, activating the automatic ejector. The notch that allows access to the cylinder is at the top rear of the frame. The revolver is double-action only because of the absence of a cocking spur, intended to avoid snagging on clothing and firing accidentally. The lock was self-cocking and was slow to respond. The delay in response made accurate shooting virtually impossible. The cylinder contains a serious design flaw, with it only notching while the hammer is cocked. This allows the cylinder to revolve by being <b>brushed</b> <b>against</b> an object or the inertia from a sudden sideways motion. As the cylinder can move freely, an empty or already fired chamber can rotate into position instead of the next shot, a dangerous event for the user during combat. Later Type 26 Revolvers have grips with lateral serrations in place of an earlier knurled pattern as well as differences in external finish, depth, and look of die stamped markings. The bluing of the steel is excellent, even though the steel used is soft compared to Western standards. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used by the Type 26 is unique to the weapon. Both the Type 26 Revolver and the ammunition used was later replaced by semi-automatic pistols such as the Nambu {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E

25|$|In {{forensic}} biology, pollen {{can tell}} a lot about where a person or object has been, because regions of the world, or even more particular locations such a certain set of bushes, will have a distinctive collection of pollen species. Pollen evidence can also reveal the season in which a particular object picked up the pollen. Pollen {{has been used to}} trace activity at mass graves in Bosnia, catch a burglar who <b>brushed</b> <b>against</b> a Hypericum bush during a crime, and has even been proposed as an additive for bullets to enable tracking them.|$|E
25|$|Count Nostitz {{immediately}} {{sprang from}} his saddle, and holding {{with his left}} hand the bridle of his own horse, which had been slightly wounded, he drew his sword, firmly resolved to shed, if necessary, the last drop of his blood in defence of his commander. Scarcely had he done so, when he saw the Cuirassiers rushing forward at the charge. To attract as little as possible their attention, he remained motionless. Most fortunately, the rapidity with which the Cuirassiers advanced amidst the twilight, already obscured by the falling rain, precluded them from recognising, or even particularly remarking, the group, although they swept so closely by that one of them rather roughly <b>brushed</b> <b>against</b> the aide de camp's horse.|$|E
500|$|For the defence, Robin Grey QC, {{explained}} to the jury that such was the extent of Hodgson's compulsive lying that he had confessed to 200 different crimes, including murders that had not happened. The Crown's case against Hodgson was that he [...] "under the influence of drink, broke into the deceased's car, intending to steal it, but then fell asleep on the back seat. When the deceased returned to her car she put her handbag onto {{the back seat and}} <b>brushed</b> <b>against</b> [...] He seized her by the back of her jumper, twisted it and strangled her, and when she was dead or dying he raped her, removing her underwear and tights with such force that one leg of the tights was torn from the other. Thereafter he made away from the scene after taking various items from the deceased." [...] Hodgson's confessions were {{a significant part of the}} case against him. The jury retired to consider their verdict at 11:00a.m. on 5February 1982, and their unanimous guilty verdict was returned at 14:15 (2:15p.m.) the same day.|$|E

2500|$|Even Maine Senator Edmund Muskie {{tested the}} limits of {{political}} muscle when he <b>brushed</b> <b>against</b> Leavitt's following. It was arranged for Muskie to go ice-fishing with Bud Leavitt—or as Muskie adviser Clyde MacDonald Jr. put it, [...] "possibly the greatest political event that could be arranged at that time." [...] MacDonald lived next to columnist Leavitt, whom the Muskie aide inveigled to accompany Muskie on a fishing trip to an Ellsworth, Maine, lake. Muskie landed the prize-winning fish, headlined in the next day's Bangor newspaper. As Muskie recalled, his fishing trip with Leavitt made a deeper impression than most of his electoral efforts. [...] "Muskie {{throughout the rest of}} his career would say, 'You know, I fought for Dickey-Lincoln , and I prevented them from closing Loring, but the thing that people talk about is that fish.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{took the}} three {{children}} {{to the home of}} William Starck, a neighbor, for immediate care. Starck's daughter, Anna Starck Benjamin, who was 4½ years old at the time, remembered [...] "the sound of Hazel's outstretched arms as they <b>brushed</b> <b>against</b> the furniture as they brought her into the house, and took her into my parents' bedroom. The crackling sound as that of frozen laundry brought in off the clothes line in winter. Then I remember the crying, so much crying." [...] They worked over Hazel for hours, trying to revive her, but without success. Hazel's mother, Blanche, was brought to the Starck house after the searchers found the children and sat in a chair, rocking back and forth, while they tended to {{the three children}}. Throughout the night when the children were missing, she had been kept company by neighbors. At one point, she drifted off to sleep, and said later that her daughter had come to her in a dream. In the dream, Hazel said, [...] "I was cold, Mama, but I'm not anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rosenberg's corps was {{weakened}} {{early in}} the campaign by the detachment of Feldmarschall-Leutnant Joseph von Dedovich's division to besiege Passau. On 19 April Rosenberg marshaled 16 infantry battalions and 15 cavalry squadrons. At 9:00 AM near Schneidert, three kilometers east of Haugen, General-Major Karl Wilhelm von Stutterheim's IV Armeekorps advance guard brigade <b>brushed</b> <b>against</b> the 12th and 21st Line Infantry of Gudin's division as they marched west. Continuing to the northeast, Rosenberg began to [...] "fritter away" [...] forces to guard his flanks and rear. He left one battalion and one squadron with the grenadiers, one battalion and four squadrons to hold Schneidert, five battalions to guard his line of march, and one battalion to hold a hill at Moosholzen. After holding the Austrians near Moosholzen and Dünzling until evening, Montbrun fell back northwest to Peising near Abbach. Montbrun reported 233 total casualties while inflicting much heavier losses on his opponents. The Austrians lost 116 killed, 452 wounded, 357 captured, and 159 missing {{for a total of}} 1,084.|$|E
