The only exception I have to have an abortion is in that case {{of the life of the}} mother.

500|$|Amy wakes on 26 June 2010 in {{her home}} to {{discover}} that her parents have been brought back into existence and she and Rory celebrate their wedding day. At the reception, River leaves her blank diary for Amy which prompts Amy to recall the Doctor and something he told {{her when she was}} seven during his rewind. She interrupts her father's speech, imploring the [...] "Raggedy" [...] Doctor from her memories to come back. As she recites the old wedding proverb ("something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue"), relating that to what the Doctor had said about the TARDIS, the TARDIS and the Doctor appear. The Doctor comes out of the TARDIS and after a brief conversation with Amy, introduces himself by saying [...] "Hello everyone! I'm Amy's imaginary friend, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> anyway!" [...] and joins the wedding festivities. Afterwards, he returns River's diary and the vortex manipulator to her so she can return to her own time. She sadly tells him he will soon learn who she truly is and that it will change everything. Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor explains to Amy and Rory that unanswered questions remain about the destruction of the TARDIS and the nature of [...] "the silence" [...] that will fall. The Doctor receives a telephone call alerting him to the presence of [...] "an escaped Egyptian goddess on the Orient Express, in space". He tells them that this will have to be goodbye. They agree that it is goodbye and Amy leans out of the TARDIS and yells [...] "Goodbye!". The three then leave on their next adventure.|$|E
