5|$|Animal House {{inspired}} Co-Ed Fever, another sitcom {{but without}} {{the involvement of the}} film's producers or cast. Set in a dorm of the formerly all-female Baxter College, the pilot of Co-Ed Fever was aired by CBS on February 4, 1979, but the network canceled the series before airing any more episodes. NBC also had its Animal House-inspired sitcom, <b>Brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sisters,</b> in which three members of Crandall College's Pi Nu fraternity interact with members of the Gamma Iota sorority. Like ABC's Delta House, <b>Brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sisters</b> lasted only three months.|$|E
50|$|At times, <b>Brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sister</b> {{has been}} {{confused}} with Hansel and Gretel, which {{has also been}} known under the alternate title of Little <b>Brother</b> <b>and</b> Little <b>Sister.</b> The Grimms selected Hansel and Gretel for the tale by that name <b>and</b> kept the <b>Brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sister</b> title for this tale. Some publications of the Hansel and Gretel tale still use the Little <b>Brother</b> <b>and</b> Little <b>Sister</b> title, causing confusion for readers.|$|R

5|$|As {{with local}} Tamils, the {{preferred}} marriage pattern {{is based on}} cross cousin preference. Parallel cousins are considered <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters</b> and are ineligible as partners. As most marriages take place between first and second cousins, clan endogamy even it is present is of no value. Within a village, most of the residents are related and this carries on over to villages that are three to five miles away as well. The longer the distance the more distantly are the villagers related to each other. Related lineages also maintain places of worship that are the private property of the family group.|$|E

She compared the experience to starting a new school in terms of aspects of life that she had to become re-accustomed to. Over time, several of her <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters</b> left or were expelled from the church.|$|E

5|$|By 1997, Martin had met Classics student Tim Rice-Oxley. During {{a weekend}} in the English village Virginia Water in Surrey they asked each other to play their own songs on the piano. Martin, finding Rice-Oxley to be talented, asked him to be Coldplay's {{keyboard}} player but Rice-Oxley refused as his own band, Keane, was already active. Days after, this event would shape the second line-up of Keane and keep Coldplay's unaltered, thus leaving both bands as quartets. In 1998, the band released 500 copies of the Safety EP. Most of the discs were given to record companies and friends; only 50 copies remained for sale to the public. In December of that year, Coldplay signed to the independent label Fierce Panda. Their first release was the three-track <b>Brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sisters</b> EP, which they had quickly recorded over four days in February 1999.|$|E

5|$|Eusèbe Jaojoby {{was born}} on 29 July 1955, {{in the village of}} Anboahangibe, near Sambava in the northeastern coastal Sava Region of Madagascar. Jaojoby and his twelve younger <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters</b> were raised Catholic; early {{experiences}} singing hymns in the local church choir and traditional folk songs at local Betsimisaraka moonlight village festivals made him realize he possessed vocal talent. At the age of 15, Jaojoby's father sent him to continue his studies in Diego-Suarez, one of the six regional capitals at the time. The town was home to a large contingent of French soldiers and expatriates, and contemporary Western genres were commonly heard on the radio and in the town's many nightclubs. Jaojoby was inspired by these styles and particularly by Freddy Ranarison, who in the 1960s became the first Malagasy musician to use an electric guitar to perform coastal musical styles.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} year of his life, George was the only heir to the German territories of his father and three childless uncles. George's brother, Frederick Augustus, was born in 1661, and the two boys (known as Görgen and Gustchen by the family) were brought up together. Their mother was absent for almost a year (1664–65) during a long convalescent holiday in Italy, but corresponded {{regularly}} with her sons' governess and took a great interest in their upbringing, even more so upon her return. Sophia bore Ernest Augustus another four sons and a daughter. In her letters, Sophia describes George as a responsible, conscientious child who set an example to his younger <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters.</b>|$|E
