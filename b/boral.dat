5|$|Shooting {{started on}} 27 October 1952. <b>Boral,</b> a village near Calcutta, was {{selected}} in early 1953 {{as the main}} location for principal photography, and night scenes were shot in-studio. The technical team included several first-timers, including Ray himself and cinematographer Subrata Mitra, who had never operated a film camera. Art director Bansi Chandragupta had professional experience, having worked with Jean Renoir on The River. Both Mitra and Chandragupta went on to establish themselves as respected professionals.|$|E
5|$|For {{the role}} of Apu, Ray advertised in {{newspapers}} for boys of ages five to seven. None of the candidates who auditioned fulfilled Ray's expectations, but his wife spotted a boy in their neighbourhood, and this boy, Subir Banerjee, was cast as Apu. (The surname {{of three of the}} main actors happened to be Banerjee, but they were not related to each other). The hardest role to fill was the wizened old Indir. Ray eventually found Chunibala Devi, a retired stage actress living in one of Calcutta's red-light districts, as the ideal candidate. Several minor roles were played by the villagers of <b>Boral,</b> where Pather Panchali was filmed.|$|E
25|$|Bengali {{literature}} has also produced many other notable talents. For example, famous and popular Bengali poets include Ishwar Chandra Gupta, Biharilal Chakraborty, and Kaykobad. Romesh Chunder Dutt and Mir Mosharraf Hossain are notable for their works of fiction. Girish Chandra Ghosh and Dwijendralal Ray were prominent playwrights of the time, whereas Akshay Kumar <b>Boral</b> and Ramendra Sundar Tribedi {{are famous for}} their influential essays. Rassundari Devi authored the first full-fledged autobiography in modern Bengali literature in 1876.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, musical soirées {{were held}} in the large private houses of old Kolkata; but there also were some humbler houses that had similar soirées, amongst the latter being the Bowbazar home of a musical family, the <b>Borals.</b> The Jhulan Bari festival held at Bowbazar is a celebration of Indian {{classical}} music.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} {{electrification}} of {{the line}} to Kiama in 2001, the existing crossing loop was extended north and received a platform, albeit built out of scaffolding materials with most trains continuing to use the original platform. The loop also provides access to <b>Boral's</b> Dunmore Quarry. There was previously a level crossing immediately south of the station. This was closed in the late-2000s as part of improvement works to the adjacent Princes Highway.|$|R
25|$|Germany {{went into}} their {{semifinal}} match against Turkey as the favourites. However, the team {{put up a}} nervous and shaky performance, falling behind due to Uğur <b>Boral's</b> goal in the 22nd minute. Bastian Schweinsteiger equalised, and Miroslav Klose put Germany ahead with less than twelve minutes left only for Semih Şentürk to level the score in the last minutes of the match. Just as the game was heading for extra time, defender Philipp Lahm cut inside past Colin Kazim-Richards, exchanged passes with Thomas Hitzlsperger, and stole in at the near post to score in the final minute, sending Germany into the final against Spain.|$|R
25|$|Historically, {{the river}} was {{actively}} dredged by <b>Boral</b> Sands Inc, ostensibly to make the river navigable. The constant extraction of river bed material by dredges has had considerable effect on the river. These impacts include increased turbidity, bed and bank erosion and changes in tidal hydraulics. The tidal nature {{of the river and}} the generally muddy nature of the sands removed by dredging created a woefully sludgy clayey sediment load in the river which did not clear.|$|E
25|$|Ballarat rose to {{prominence}} as a goldrush boomtown, though gold no longer plays {{a pivotal role}} in the economy of the city. Nevertheless, deep underground mining continues to the present date with a single main mine operating. There are still thought to be large, undiscovered gold reserves in the Ballarat region, with investigations being made by local and national companies. Lihir Gold invested in Ballarat Goldfields in 2006, however it downscaled its operations in 2009 due to the expense of extraction before selling its stake in 2010 to Castlemaine Goldfields. Along with gold, lignite (coal), kaolin (clay) and iron ore have also been mined in the Ballarat region and nearby Lal Lal however many of the resource deposits have since been exhausted. An active quarrying industry with large enterprises including <b>Boral</b> Limited extracts and manufactures building materials from the Ballarat region, including clays, aggregates, cements, asphalts.|$|E

50|$|Located {{along the}} {{southern}} perimeter of the site facing Cimitier Street, the gasometers were where gas produced at the gasworks was stored at pressure for later distribution. At present, three of the original five gasometers are on site in various levels of salvage. The newest No.5 Gasometer built in the mid 1940s is mostly untouched except for the gas bell has been removed and the pit filled. This gasometer is mounted on a concrete base with a 12 sided steel frame mounted on top that has been painted red. A few meters to the east are the brick and sandstone foundations of two smaller gasometers; the middle dating from the late 1800s and the furthest to the east {{being one of the}} original 2 built in 1860. These 2 gas holders were smaller than the newer one and were last painted <b>Boral's</b> yellow and green colour scheme before they were dismantled in 2007. Shortly after dismantling, a proposal was forwarded to council to develop all 3 gasometers as a single 6 storey apartment block but was cancelled. The other one of the first 2 gasometers on site was dismantled in the early 1900s with the foundations and water pit being converted into a covered tar and liquor well located in the eastern most corner of the site (now vacant). In the 1946 plan for the site, a final 250 000 cubic ft. gasometer was proposed to be built to the northwest of the No.5 Gasometer but was canceled {{along with the rest of}} the proposal.|$|R
2500|$|The {{efficacy}} of dredging the river upstream {{of the city}} reach to make it [...] "navigable" [...] was always in doubt, {{and the effect of}} the artificial sediment load in Moreton Bay grew to concern environmentalists worried that sediment was choking sea grass paddocks which were grazing territory for dugong. In a meeting concerning the matter in October 1996, including two State Government Ministers and three Mayors, an agreement to cease the dredging of sand and gravel from the river by 30 September 1997 was formed. <b>Boral</b> Resources Pty. Ltd. resisted the agreement, but ultimately all dredging was stopped by the agreed date.|$|E
