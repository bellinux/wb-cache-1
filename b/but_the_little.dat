5|$|As with {{previous}} games, the visuals of End of Ages were widely praised. The switch to real-time rendering was generally {{seen as a}} positive step. The game's music was lauded; GameSpot's review noted the use of music in End of Ages was sparse, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> audio present set the proper tone for different Ages. A few reviewers, such as Charles Herold of the New York Times, felt that the graphics fell short of what was possible, especially compared to the prerendered visuals of Myst IV: Revelation. While Greg Kasavin of GameSpot felt that though the visuals were on par {{with previous}} games, End of Ages was missing several elements which made Myst IV more immersive; only important, story-driving items could be interacted with, for example, and the player makes no sounds or footsteps in the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Victoria's brother, Ernest Louis, {{died and}} soon {{afterwards}} her widowed sister-in-law, nephew, granddaughter {{and two of}} her great-grandchildren all died in an air crash at Ostend. Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark, had married Victoria's nephew (Ernest Louis's son), George Donatus of Hesse. They and their two young sons, Louis and Alexander, were all killed. Cecilie was pregnant {{at the time and}} the stillborn child was found among the wreckage. Cecilie's youngest child, Johanna, who was not on the plane, was adopted by her uncle Prince Louis of Hesse and by Rhine <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> girl only survived her parents and older brothers by eighteen months, dying in 1939 of meningitis.|$|E
25|$|There {{are reports}} that a sacred stone was {{enshrined}} at the temple {{that may have been}} a meteorite. The Black Stone set into the wall of the Kaaba has often been presumed to be a meteorite, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> available evidence for this is inconclusive. Although the use of the metal found in meteorites is also recorded in myths of many countries and cultures where the celestial source was often acknowledged, scientific documentation only began in the last few centuries.|$|E

25|$|Town Wall. Established by charter in 1326 by Edward II to the Bailiffs of Carlingford {{it allowed}} them to levy murage for its building. Not much remains however <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> that does has some {{externally}} splayed musket loops that would indicate the arrival of firearms to Ireland in the late 15th century. It {{is likely that the}} wall had an external ditch to strengthen its defences. Its purpose was to serve as a barrier to ensure that goods entering the town had to pass through a town gate (and hence could be taxed) but it also had the purpose of creating a boundary between Gael and Norman.|$|E
25|$|Rain ravaged {{the match}} between Somerset and Lancashire {{allowing}} little {{play on the}} first three days. Between the showers, Lancashire had Somerset at 48 for 2 on the first day, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> play that was possible after that gave Mike Burns (87) and Sanath Jayasuriya (72 not out after three days) opportunity to increase the score to 195 for 3 on day 3. A draw looked more than likely, even if the sides would agree to forfeiting an innings. The fourth day was {{a full day of}} cricket, and Muttiah Muralitharan took five for 56 for Lancashire as they bowled Somerset out for 294. Iain Sutcliffe then lifted Lancashire to four batting points and 351 for 3 declared with his 150, well helped by an unbeaten century from Australian Brad Hodge.|$|E
25|$|They set {{out with}} 100 knights and 400 mounted men-at-arms upon their {{campaign}} {{in the spring of}} 1205. They took Patras and Pondikos by assault, and Andravida opened its gates. The people of the countryside came to make their submission and were confirmed in their property and local customs. Only in Arcadia (now Kyparissia) were the crusaders resisted. This opposition was led by landlords from Arcadia and Laconia, particularly the Chamaretos family, allied to the Slavic Melingoi tribe. The resistance was soon joined by a certain Michael, identified by many scholars with Michael I Komnenos Doukas (1204–1215) who was then creating his own principality in Epiros. Michael advanced into the Peloponnese with 5,000 men, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> crusader army defeated him at Kountouras in northeast Messenia. Then the crusaders completed the conquest of the region and advanced into the interior of the country, occupying the entire peninsula with the exception of Arcadia and Laconia.|$|E

500|$|Kylie had {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. Chris True from AllMusic gave it two-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars, giving it a mixed review. He said [...] "While the production values on Kylie's debut are dated at best and the tunes are nothing but standard late-'80s Stock-Aitken-Waterman bubblegum, there are some rather endearing qualities to it. Firstly, she shows a lot more personality than the other Stock, et al." [...] He did say that Minogue would become a pop star and a [...] "European icon". Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave it three stars out of five. The stand out track, he said, was [...] "I Should Be So Lucky", as he said [...] "but anyone who denies 'I Should Be So Lucky' classic status has clearly let their tune detection muscles turn to flab". He also finished saying [...] "The bog-standard S.A.W. production renders Kylie as dated as that haircut on the album cover, and it's as loaded with variety as a loaf of bread, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> Aussie pop rocket is already showing signs of personality and the record's quintessentially '80s charm ultimately wins through." ...|$|E
2500|$|After writing Sara Crewe, Burnett {{returned}} to the material in 1902, penning the three-act stage play A Little Un-fairy Princess, which ran in London over the autumn of that year. Around the time it transferred to New York City {{at the start of}} 1903 with title was shortened to A Little Princess.

2500|$|Spectre {{was first}} {{presented}} on 19 April 1911 by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in the Théâtre de Monte Carlo, Monte Carlo. Tamara Karsavina danced The Young Girl and Nijinsky danced The Rose. Grace Robert writes that Spectre was an [...] "immediate success". Diaghilev was surprised; he thought Spectre a trifle not worth notice, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> ballet {{became one of}} the most loved productions of the Ballets Russes.|$|E

2500|$|In 291 BC Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges, as proconsul, {{defeated}} the Pentri, the largest Samnite tribe, and took their stronghold of Cominium Ocritum. The consul Lucius Postimius Megellus operating form Apulia attacked the Hirpini tribe of the Samnites and seized their large town of Venusia. Because its location offered control over Lucania and Apulia {{as well as}} Samnium the Romans founded the largest colony they ever established. Dionysius of Halicarnassus gave a figure of 20,000 colonists, which is impossibly high. Details for 290 BC are scant, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> surviving information suggests that the consuls Manius Curius Dentatus and Publius Cornelius Rufinus campaigned [...] to mop up the last pockets of resistance throughout Samnium and according to Eutropius this involved some large scale fighting.|$|E
2500|$|O'Reilly was {{remembered as}} witty, kindly, generously tolerant, and sensitive. Though {{he did not}} feel {{challenged}} by his work as a schoolmaster, he had a good understanding of boys and gained their affection. Not long before his death he wrote of himself: [...] "I am a failure; I have attempted many things, writing, teaching, politics, drifted along, done just enough to live." [...] This feeling of frustration and failure was characteristic. His early verse was seldom of more than average quality, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> selection published in 1924 with Tears and Triumph and Five Corners, under the title of The Prose and Verse of Dowell O'Reilly, shows him to be a poet, however limited in output and scope. Five Corners contains some of the best Australian short stories ever written. [...] "His Photo on the wall" [...] is considered a masterpiece for its mingling of humour and tragedy, and his beautiful little sketch, [...] "Twilight" [...] is a triumph in economy of means. O'Reilly wrote so little perhaps because of his tendency towards self-criticism. He was known as a perfectionist.|$|E
2500|$|Koceski was {{recruited}} {{as a football}} player by Pitt, Penn State, Army, Navy, Notre Dame, Alabama, Tennessee, and Columbia, but he chose the University of Michigan. [...] In a 1948 interview, Koceski explained his selection of Michigan, [...] "Ever since I was {{in the sixth grade}} at First Ward public school, I had wanted to go to Michigan. [...] It seemed {{too good to be true}} when they accepted me." [...] In 1947, he played on the freshman team coached by Wally Weber. [...] Koceski joined the varsity team in 1948 and helped the Wolverines to an undefeated season and national championship. [...] In Michigan's 28–0 victory over Northwestern in 1948, Koceski scored three touchdowns. [...] Michigan's fourth touchdown in the Northwestern game resulted from a Koceski fumble as he crossed the goal line, with the ball being recovered in the end zone by teammate Bob Erben. [...] Following the Northwestern game, the Associated Press wrote:"Koceski carried the ball only six times for 20 yards, a running figure exceeded by both Ortmann and End Dick Rifenburg, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> right halfback who stepped into the man-sized shoes of the departed Bump Elliott and fills 'em like they were made for him caught three passes for 40 yards more." ...|$|E
