[...] In 1924, George Wallace {{recruited}} several Scottish League players to play for his team, the Shawsheen Indians of the New England National League. At the time, Wallace had convinced William Madison <b>Wood,</b> owner <b>of</b> the American Woolen Company, to sponsor the team. With the financial <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wood,</b> Wallace entered the Indians in the 1925 National Challenge Cup, {{the first time the}} team had entered that competition.

The next season, Wallace moved the Indians into the first division American Soccer League where it performed well, until the death <b>of</b> Mr. <b>Wood.</b> The death <b>of</b> Mr. <b>Wood</b> brought the end of the American Woolen Company’s support of the Indians and the team was forced to withdraw from the ASL at the end of March 1926.

In some extraordinary way the incident of the board became impossible; it hadn't happened, he felt, or it had happened differently. Anyhow {{there was no time}} to think that over now. He guided the lady to the two little greenhouses, made her note the opening glow of the great autumnal border and brought her to the rock garden. She stooped and loved and almost kissed the soft healthy cushions of pampered saxifrage: she appreciated the cleverness of the moss-bed--where there were droseras; she knelt to the gentians; she had a kindly word for that bank-holiday corner where London Pride still belatedly rejoiced; she cried out at the delicate Iceland poppies that thrust up between the stones of the rough pavement; and so in the most amiable accord they came to the raised seat in the heart of it all, and sat down and took in the whole effect of the place, and <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>woods,</b> the lush borders, the neat lawn, the still neater orchard, the pergola, the nearer delicacies among the stones, and the gable, the shining white rough-cast of the walls, the casement windows, the projecting upper story, the carefully sought-out old tiles of the roof. And everything bathed in that caressing sunshine which does not scorch nor burn but gilds and warms deliciously, that summer sunshine which only northward islands know.|$|R

60|$|The Senator {{made his}} way down the fence to the bank on which Goarly had stood with his gun, then over into Goarly's field, and so round the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wood</b> till he saw a small red brick house {{standing}} perhaps four hundred yards from the covert, just on the elbow of a lane. It was a miserable-looking place with a pigsty and a dung-heap and a small horse-pond or duck-puddle all close around it. The stack of chimneys seemed to threaten to fall, and as he approached from behind he could see that the two windows opening that way were stuffed with rags. There was a little cabbage garden which now seemed to be all stalks, and a single goose waddling about the duck-puddle. The Senator went to the door, and having knocked, was investigated by a woman from behind it. Yes, this was Goarly's house. What did the gentleman want? Goarly was at work in the field.

500|$|The trials {{with the}} Chesma greatly {{affected}} the armour protection {{design of the}} Borodino-class ships. The Krupp cemented-armour plates were sized to match the frames to provide support for their joints, and they were locked together with mortise-and-tenon joints to better distribute the shock of a shell's impact. The [...] waterline belt covered the middle [...] of the ship. It had a total height of , [...] of which was above the design waterline and [...] below.

The rear portion of the forecastle deck was protected by an upward extension of the upper belt in the area of the forward barbettes and the upper casemates. The upper casemates themselves were protected from axial fire by 100mm transverse bulkheads. Behind the side armour was an inboard longitudinal splinter bulkhead that was [...] thick between the middle and lower decks. This decreased to [...] between the middle and upper decks. The bulkhead sloped away from the edge of the lower deck to the lower edge of the armour belt with a total thickness of 75mm. The slope was one 50mm plate of Krupp non-cemented armour (KNC) on a 25mm nickel-steel plate. The forward end of the armoured citadel was protected separately and the transverse bulkhead was therefore only 75mm thick. The rear bulkhead had no other protection and was [...] thick between the middle and lower decks, decreasing to 75mm at the level of the armour belt.|$|R
40|$|Synopsis Plant {{and animal}} biomechanists {{have much in}} common. Although their frame of {{reference}} differs, they think about the natural world in similar ways. While researchers studying animals might explore airflow around flapping wings, the actuation of muscles in arms and legs, or the material properties of spider silk, researchers studying plants might explore {{the flow of water}} around fluttering seaweeds, the grasping ability of climbing vines, or the material properties <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> Here we summarize recent studies of plant biomechanics highlighting several current research themes in the field: expulsion of high-speed reproductive projectiles, generation of slow movements by shrinking and swelling cell walls, effects of ontogenetic shifts in mechanical properties of stems, flexible reconfiguration and material properties of seaweeds under crashing waves, and the development of botanically-inspired commercial products. Our hope is that this synopsis will resonate with both plant and animal biologists, encourage cross-pollination across disciplines, and promote fruitful interdisciplinary collaborations in the future. Plants versus animals Plant biomechanics is not a new field, but dates <b>back</b> to studies <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> and the impressive stature of tree...|$|R

50|$|The {{village of}} West Wemyss {{began as a}} {{settlement}} around the site of Wemyss Castle which developed into a centre for the salt industry in the area. A harbour was later built in 1621 by the Wemyss family {{for the use of}} coal exportation from the pits on the lands of their estate. The harbour would become a major export point for coal by the late 17th century. The ships brought <b>back</b> imports <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> iron and flax from the Baltic Countries. A wet dock was added for the increased demand of the coal in the 1870s. Towards the latter stages of the 19th century, the village found itself surrounded by several mines - such as the Michael Pit in nearby East Wemyss. The industry, which saw trade with England and The Low Countries, started to struggle once the new docks were opened in Methil further along the Fife coast. Gradually, the demand for the harbour began to fall and it went into decline. The harbour has since been filled in and part of the old village restored, becoming a conservation area with several attractive buildings. William Angus Knight, Professor of Moral Philosophy at St Andrews University, editor and biographer of William Wordsworth, lived here as a child from 1844.|$|R
