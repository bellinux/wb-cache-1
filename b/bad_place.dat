Jade meets Callum and realises that he is Sonya's son, that she left with their grandmother. Callum tries to find his mother. After an accident, Callum is rushed to {{hospital}} and he realises that Sonya is his mother. Sonya confirms it and a devastated Toadie asks her to leave. Callum begins meeting Sonya in secret and she tells him that she left him with her grandmother because she was in a <b>bad</b> <b>place</b> due to her addictions. Sonya's ex-boyfriend and Callum's father, Troy Miller, comes to Ramsay Street. Sonya introduces Callum to Troy and she tries to reconnect with Toadie. Troy kisses Sonya, but she realises she still loves Toadie and they get back together. Troy reacts badly and he punches Toadie, shouts at Callum and tries to force Sonya into having an emotional breakdown. He leaves shortly after. Sonya decides to buy the community gardens and turn the land into a garden nursery. Sonya unsuccessfully applies for a loan, but Toadie begins working for a law firm and gets the loan, allowing Sonya to buy the gardens. Sonya and Toadie decide to bring their plans to try for a baby forward, but worry when Sonya does not become pregnant.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of Nuristan is ethnically {{distinct from the}} rest of Afghanistan, and divided into four major groups, the Kom, Kata, Kushtoz, and Kalasha. These subgroups were in turn divided into different clans and sects of the Islamic religion, depending on lineages and the interpretations of individual religious leaders. These groups could clash violently over water rights, pasture, and religious beliefs. Five different languages and various dialects are spoken by these groups, making translators from other areas of Afghanistan useless. The Soviets had to contend with a rebel group known as the Dawlet of eastern Nuristan. They were professing a Salafi version of Islam, and hostile to any political rivals. The Nuristanis had resisted Islam as late as the year 1895 and before that had been considered a nation of infidels with a long tradition of violently resisting outsiders, their beliefs, and their invasions. Resistance in Nuristan revolved around a specific group of Islamic fighters known as Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin or HIG. During the Soviet occupation HIG received more support from the CIA than any other Mujahideen resistance group. When it came to infiltration from Pakistan, and setting up ambushes, HIG was regarded as the most skillful. In 2006 HIG was actively resisting the Afghan government. When Captain Aaron Swain of Cherokee Co. had sounded out Afghan Border Police Commander Ahmed Shah about setting up near Kamdesh, he was told that HIG insurgents tried to blow up Shah’s jeep on his last trip there and it was a <b>bad</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
500|$|Burton {{explained}} that his depiction of suburbia is [...] "not a <b>bad</b> <b>place.</b> It's a weird place. I {{tried to walk}} the fine line of making it funny and strange without it being judgmental. It's a place where there's a lot of integrity." [...] Kim leaves her jock boyfriend (Jim) to be with Edward, an event that many have postulated as Burton's revenge against jocks he encountered {{as a teenager in}} suburban Burbank, CA. Jim is subsequently killed, a scene that shocked a number of observers who felt the whole tone of the film had been radically altered. Burton referred to this scene as a [...] "high school fantasy".|$|E

500|$|Two Christian reviewers {{and some}} theologians have {{mentioned}} {{the presence of}} Christian themes in the film. Writing for Catholic News Agency, Robert Barron said: I don’t {{think it is the}} least bit accidental that Waters (Gus’s last name) and Grace (Hazel’s middle name) met in the sacred heart of Christ and thereby, despite their shared suffering, managed to give life to one another... Hazel effectively repudiates her nihilism and materialism as she responds across the barrier of death to Gus’s 'okay'." [...] He also noted: [...] " [...] this film a satisfying presentation of Christianity? Hardly. But for those who are struggling to find their way to meaning and faith, it's not an entirely <b>bad</b> <b>place</b> to start." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{everyone}} {{finds out}} about Martha's situation, {{they try to}} stop her working in the club. Kate Ritchie who plays on-screen friend Sally Fletcher discussed how Martha would not take any advice from those closest to her and how Sally and Alf {{have to pick up}} the pieces for her in the end. She compared Martha's pole dancing to many real life experiences ordinary people go through. Sally's interference made Martha's situation worse, of this Ritche added: [...] "It's been hard for Sally to realise and Alf as well, just that you just have to stand back and let it run its course and be there at the end." [...] Of Martha's downward spiral and pushing her friends away, Gordon stated: [...] "Now she's found herself in this hole, she ruined all these relationships with her family, her friends, Jack, everyone's trying to help her and she's really against everyone, she's in a really <b>bad</b> <b>place</b> at the moment".|$|E
500|$|Nino, a key villain, {{is portrayed}} by Ron Perlman, {{one of the}} last actors to join the cast. Regarding the casting of Perlman, Refn said, [...] "The {{character}} of Nino was originally not particularly interesting, so I asked Ron why he wanted to be in my movie when he's done so many great films. When Perlman said, 'I always wanted to play a Jewish man who wants to be an Italian gangster', and I asked why, and he said, 'because that's what I am – a Jewish boy from New York', well, that automatically cemented it for me." [...] Oscar Isaac portrays a Latino convict named Standard, who is married to Irene and is just released from prison a week after Irene meets The Driver. He found the role to be a bit unappealing and chose to turn the archetypal character into something more. He said of the role: As soon as I sat down with Nicolas, he explained this universe and world of the story, so we made the character into someone interested in owning a restaurant, someone who made some wrong decisions in his life, ending up in a <b>bad</b> <b>place.</b> By making 'Standard' more specific and more interesting, we found that it made the story that more compelling.|$|E

500|$|According to the {{response}} by Robert van Voren, Pekhterev {{in his article}} condescendingly argues that the Serbsky Institute was not so <b>bad</b> <b>place</b> and that Nekipelov exaggerates and slanders it, but Pekhterev, by doing so, misses the main point: living conditions in the Serbsky Institute were not bad, those who passed through psychiatric examination there were {{in a certain sense}} [...] "on holiday" [...] in comparison with the living conditions of the Gulag; and all the same, everyone was aware that the Serbsky Institute was more than the [...] "gates of hell" [...] from where people were sent to specialized psychiatric hospitals in Chernyakhovsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Kazan, Blagoveshchensk, and that is not all. Their life was transformed to unimaginable horror with daily tortures by forced administration of drugs, beatings and other forms of punishment. Many went crazy, could not endure what was happening to them, some even died during the [...] "treatment" [...] (for example, a miner from Donetsk Alexey Nikitin). Many books and memoirs are written about the life in the psychiatric Gulag and every time when reading them a shiver seizes us. The Soviet psychiatric terror in its brutality and targeting the mentally ill as the most vulnerable group of society had nothing on the Nazi euthanasia programs. The punishment by placement in a mental hospital was as effective as imprisonment in Mordovian concentration camps in breaking persons psychologically and physically. The recent history of the USSR should be given a wide publicity to immunize society against possible repetitions of the Soviet practice of political abuse of psychiatry. The issue remains highly relevant.|$|E
2500|$|William James' {{views were}} ambivalent. While he {{believed}} in free will on [...] "ethical grounds", {{he did not believe}} that there was evidence for it on scientific grounds, nor did his own introspections support it, he did believe that the problem of free will was a metaphysical issue and, therefore, could not be settled by science. Moreover, he did not accept incompatibilism as formulated below; he did not believe that the indeterminism of human actions was a prerequisite of moral responsibility. In his work Pragmatism, he wrote that [...] "instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and praise" [...] regardless of metaphysical theories. He did believe that indeterminism is important as a [...] "doctrine of relief" [...] – it allows for the view that, although the world may be in many respects a <b>bad</b> <b>place,</b> it may, through individuals' actions, become a better one. Determinism, he argued, undermines meliorism – the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Ian Harding portrays Ezra Fitz, {{a former}} English teacher at Rosewood High who begins a {{relationship}} with Aria which causes {{a lot of tension}} due to her being his student. However they keep a steady relationship until season 4 when it is revealed that he is writing a book about the disappearance of Alison DiLaurentis which causes Aria to break up with him. It is also revealed that he had a very brief relationship with Alison before she disappeared after she met him in bar near Hollis with Charlotte Drake. After the time jump, Ezra is in a very <b>bad</b> <b>place</b> due to his girlfriend Nicole being kidnapped and killed in Nicaragua while they were there doing charity work. He is writing a book about his experience which is being published through the company Aria is currently working at which causes them to rekindle their old friendship. In the season 6 finale, they have sex which causes them to talk about their relationship and Ezra proposes to Aria which after some hesitation and a confession about the death of Archer Dunhill, she accepts. They are married in the series finale.|$|E
40|$|Given a group G and {{a number}} field K, the Grunwald problem asks whether given field {{extensions}} of completions of K at finitely many places can be approximated by a single field extension of K with Galois group G. This {{can be viewed as}} the case of constant groups G in the more general problem of determining for which K-groups G the variety SL_n/G has weak approximation. We show that away from an explicit set of <b>bad</b> <b>places</b> both problems have an affirmative answer for iterated semidirect products with abelian kernel. Furthermore, we give counterexamples to both assertions at <b>bad</b> <b>places.</b> These {{turn out to be the}} first examples of transcendental Brauer-Manin obstructions to weak approximation for homogeneous spaces.
