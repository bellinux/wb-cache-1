40|$|Noam Chomsky (2005) {{proposed}} that a ‘third factor’, consisting of general principles and natural laws, may explain core properties {{of language in}} a principled manner, minimizing the need for either genetic endowment or experience. But the focus on third-factor patterns in much recent bio-linguistic work is misguided for several reasons: First, ‘the’ third factor is a vague and disparate collection of unrelated components, useless as an analytical tool. Second, the vagueness of the third factor, together with the desire for principled explanations, too often leads to sweeping claims, such as syntax “coming for free, directly from physics”, that are unwarranted without a case-by-case causal analysis. Third, attention is diverted away from a proper causal analysis of language as a <b>biological</b> <b>feature.</b> The point with biolinguistics is to acknowledge the language faculty as a <b>biological</b> <b>feature.</b> The best way forward towards an understanding of language {{is to take the}} biology connection seriously, instead of dabbling with physics...|$|R

25|$|Although the {{two species}} Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica have {{extremely}} similar <b>biological</b> <b>features,</b> and {{are known to be}} almost indistinguishable, they in fact have several differences regarding their nest characteristics. Vespula germanica nests generally survive the winter, while those of Vespula vulgaris do not. The reason for this difference mostly comes from the variation in prey each species feeds on. Vespula vulgaris food sources are greatly affected by the temperature while that of Vespula germanica are not, providing them with a much higher chance of survival even during the winter. Because many Vespula germanica are able to overwinter and most Vespula vulgaris do not, except for the queen, this affects the nest size of {{the two species}}.

[...] Darwin's theory of evolution challenges the teleological argument by postulating an alternative explanation to that of an intelligent designer—namely, evolution by natural selection.

2500|$|Franz Boas founded modern American {{anthropology}} {{with the}} establishment of the first graduate program in anthropology at Columbia University in 1896. [...] At the time the dominant model of culture was that of cultural evolution, which posited that human societies progressed through stages of savagery to barbarism to civilization; thus, societies that for example are based on horticulture and Iroquois kinship terminology are less evolved than societies based on agriculture and Eskimo kinship terminology. [...] One of Boas's greatest accomplishments was to demonstrate convincingly that this model is fundamentally flawed, empirically, methodologically, and theoretically. Moreover, he felt that our knowledge of different cultures was so incomplete, and often based on unsystematic or unscientific research, {{that it was impossible to}} develop any scientifically valid general model of human cultures. Instead, he established the principle of cultural relativism and trained students to conduct rigorous participant observation field research in different societies. Boas understood the capacity for culture to involve symbolic thought and social learning, and considered the evolution of a capacity for culture to coincide with the evolution of other, <b>biological,</b> <b>features</b> defining genus Homo. [...] Nevertheless, he argued that culture could not be reduced to biology or other expressions of symbolic thought, such as language. Boas and his students understood culture inclusively and resisted developing a general definition of culture. Indeed, they resisted identifying [...] "culture" [...] as a thing, instead using culture as an adjective rather than a noun. Boas argued that cultural [...] "types" [...] or [...] "forms" [...] are always in a state of flux. His student Alfred Kroeber argued that the [...] "unlimited receptivity and assimilativeness of culture" [...] made it practically impossible to think of cultures as discrete things.|$|E
