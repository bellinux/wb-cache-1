Gas discharge lamps in particular are a key product category in this regard, considering both the presence of mercury and of rare earth materials in this waste stream. Nordic countries in particular are known for advanced collection and recycling systems and this article compares the EPR systems <b>for</b> <b>gas</b> discharge <b>lamps.</b> The EPR systems for lamps are evaluated using theory-based evaluation approaches to analyse both the performance of lamp EPR systems and challenges perceived by key stakeholders.

To ensure good agreement for rich conditions, correction functions that are dependent on the local equivalence ratio are introduced into the global mechanism. In {{a comparison of the}} optimized 3 -step global {{reaction mechanism}} with the reference detailed reaction mechanism, GRI Mech 3. 0, the results show that the gas temperature and emissions are reasonably well predicted for lean and rich conditions. The optimized 3 -step global reaction scheme is adapted in the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of a swirl-stabilized syngas burner, designed by Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery (SIT syngas <b>burner)</b> <b>for</b> <b>gas</b> turbines.

40|$|The {{utilisation}} of low-grade biomass {{requires an}} appropriate technology {{that meets the}} increased demands regarding emission reduction (e. g. NOx). Within this work a new <b>burner</b> <b>for</b> low calorific value (LCV) gas applying flameless oxidation (FLOX®) will be presented that replaces the conventional flame burner of a dual-chamber furnace. The integration of an adapted FLOX®-burner has shown several benefits. Different bio-residues were tested and a more stable combustion with enhanced burnout was achieved for all tested fuels. Furthermore, the burner can be operated in broader range of operation and closer to stoichiometric conditions. Due to the high power density of a FLOX®-burner the complete facility could be downsized in the future. Still, the tests {{have shown that the}} NOx reduction potential of a FLOX®-burner is limited <b>for</b> LCV <b>gas</b> combustion since the most NO emissions are related to fuel-bond nitrogen. In the LCV gases generated from wheat pellets and rape cake pellets high concentrations of NO-precursors (NH 3 and HCN) are measured that are subsequently be oxidized to NO in the FLOX®-burner. Therefore, an air-staged <b>burner</b> <b>for</b> N-rich LCV <b>gases</b> based on flameless combustion is proposed where NO-precursors can be reduced to N 2 in a first substoichiometric region.
