40|$|The San Juan Mine and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health {{conducted}} a study to measure how development mining affected bolt loads. Twelve fully grouted, instrumented roof bolts were installed at two three-way intersections {{as part of the}} standard <b>bolting</b> <b>pattern.</b> Newly developed miniature data acquisition systems (MIDAS) were used to measure bolt load changes during initial face advance and cross-cut breakthrough. The effects of cut placement and depth on roof bolt loads were studied. This test showed how bolt loads increased at five positions along the bolt length during initial mining. Both entry advance and cross-cut breakthrough produced a similar percentage of increase in bolt loads. Geologic differences between the test sites were probably responsible for the differences in amounts of bolt loading. The test site with more top coal and a higher rock quality designation (RQD) had lower bolt loads...|$|E

The systems SOUT (support choice and dimensioning, 1989), SOUT 2, PLANANK (planning of bolt-support), Exos (layout planning diagnosis, 1994), Sout 3 (1995) {{have been developed}} in close cooperation by CdF 1, INERIS 2, EMN 3 (France) and RAG 4, DMT 5, TH- Aachen 6 (Germany); ISLSP (Integrated Software for Layout and support planning) development is in progress (completion scheduled for July 1996). This new software technology in combination with conventional programming systems, numerical models and existing databases {{turned out to be}} suited for setting-up an intelligent decision aid for layout and roadway support planning. The system enhances reliability of planning and optimises the safety-to-cost ratio for: • deformation forecast for roadways in seam and surrounding rocks, consideration of the general position of the roadway in the rock mass (zones of increased pressure, position of operating and mined panels). • support dimensioning • yielding arches, rigid arches, porch sets, rigid rings, yielding rings and bolting / shotcreting for drifts • yielding arches, rigid arches and porch sets for roadways in seam • bolt support for gateroads (assessment of exclusion criteria and calculation of the <b>bolting</b> <b>pattern)</b> • bolting of face-end zones (feasibility and safety assessment; stability guarantee). 1 Charbonnages de France, French collieries. ^ Institut National de l'Environnement et des RISques industriels: National Institute for Environment an...|$|E
40|$|Coal Operations Australia Limited Operates the Chain Valley, Wallarah and Moonee Collieries {{which are}} located in the Newcastle Coal Fields of New South Wales in the Catherine Hill Bay area {{approximately}} 100 km north of Sydney. Operations are in the Great Northern seam, which until recent years were all conducted under an immediate roof of a strong conglomerate. Large areas of the current reserves at all operations are in areas of a “claystone” immediate roof. All three mines have attempted at various stages of their history to find an economic mining method under these claystone roof conditions, with varying degrees of success at each operation. Moonee currently operates a longwall under claystone roof while Chain Valley and Wallarah are place-changing operations which have operated under claystone with some success. The nature of the “claystone” roof horizons in the three mines is often seen as different at each operation but in practice all of the claystones exhibit similar properties – low strength layers particularly at the coal-claystone interface. Strata control in conditions where the immediate roof above the coal seam is claystone appears to be most sensitive to coal beam thickness left as roof coal, roof <b>bolting</b> <b>pattern</b> and anchorage strength, drivage standards, horizontal stress direction, frequency and type of structures present, exposure time before bolting and possibly depth of cover. Coal beam thickness should be maximised wherever possible to achieve an optimum support density. Place-change mining using deep cuts up to 15 m has been successfully carried out under claystone and can be a productive mining method in this environment. There may be potential at Moonee Colliery to introduce place-changing as a method of remnant area mining or even as a gateroad development method. The most critical roof support issues in achieving high productivity under a claystone roof are the setting and maintenance of very high support installation standards {{and the development of a}} robust support management plan responsive to changes in strata conditions. This paper sets out to describe and discuss the various attempts to achieve economic success at each of the operations in a claystone roof environment...|$|E

40|$|A {{finite element}} {{solution}} is {{developed for the}} problem of time-history response of reinforced underground cavity subjected to dynamic disturbances of the underground environment. The cavity can be of any shape, reinforced by either rock bolts or any elastic liner, with bending stiffness taken into consideration. Available methods that can solve the cavity problem are examined and an available computer programme (plane stress) modified. Introduction of a new reinforcing plate element necessitated development of two new subroutines and the extension of a third one along with certain modifications in the other subroutines and the main programme for matching requirements. The modifications enable the determination of displacements and the internal forces - time histories of the liner. [...] A quantitative study of the following parameters that affect {{the response of the}} cavity reinforcement and the surrounding medium is carried out: 1) cavity reinforcement, 2) cavity shape, 3) isolation of the entire structure from the surrounding medium by a soft, energy absorbing material and 4) properties of the filling material in the cut-and-cover structural type. The modified computer programme has applications to problems outside the field of two-dimensional rock-structure interaction such as the dynamic analysis of beams, plane frames and arches. [...] A finite element model is developed to simulate the dynamic analysis of infinite space. The results of the study indicate that reinforcing the cavity by a steel liner decreases the stresses in the medium by about 10 % while the use of a rock <b>bolting</b> <b>pattern</b> with about 80 % of the amount of steel required in a reinforcing liner decreases the stresses around the cavity by 25 % and more. The horseshoe shape proves to be the best among the various shapes considered decreasing the stresses by 10 - 15 %. Large reductions (of the order of 80 %) in shell (liner) membrane forces and bending moments are reached by isolating the entire structure from the surrounding medium by a soft, energy absorbing material, which agree with the results from another investigation. It is also pointed out that a proper selection of the properties of the filling material in the cut-and-cover structure can reduce the internal forces in the structure and the stresses in the adjacent medium. It is shown that a significant reduction cannot be achieved by a single property variation but only through a proper combination of different properties (Figs. 33 to 36). The results obtained from the new model indicate the need for further modelling work in the solution of earthquake interaction problems for underground cavities...|$|E

5000|$|Flanges {{are flat}} rings {{around the end}} of pipes which mate with an {{equivalent}} flange from another pipe, the two being held together by bolts usually passed through holes drilled through the flanges. A deformable gasket, usually elastomeric, placed between raised faces on the mating flanges provides the seal. Flanges are designed to a large number of specifications that differ because of dimensional variations in pipes sizes and pressure requirements, and because of independent standards development. In the U.S. flanges are either threaded or welded onto the pipe. In the European market flanges are usually welded onto the pipe. In the US flanges are available in a standard 125 lb. <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern</b> as well as a 250 lb (and heavier) <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern</b> (steel <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern).</b> Both are usually rated at [...] A flanged joint is rigid and can bear both tension and compression as well as a limited degree of shear and bending.

AMC's 1956 to 1966 V8s used a different bell housing <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern</b> that was slightly larger in diameter than the six cylinder bell. When AMC discontinued their first V8 engine design after 1966, the bell housing changed; all 1966-up V8 bell housing <b>bolt</b> <b>patterns</b> are the same. The bell housing for six-cylinder engines changed to match the V8 in 1972 when AMC switched from Borg-Warner to Chrysler transmissions automatic. The flywheel also changed from 153 teeth (a common Chevy size) to 164 teeth (a common Ford size). Starter motors used with the 1966-up V8 bellhousing were sourced from Motorcraft which interchanges with the Ford V8 and some of their inline sixes (which uses a separate starter solenoid) - the Jeep 4.0 L uses a Mitsubishi-designed starter which has an integrated solenoid which is lighter in weight but retaining the two mounting bolts with a threaded top hole and unthreaded hole which bolts to the transmission bellhousing.|$|R
5000|$|Numerous changes {{occurred}} in 1971. First came another new grille design (the [...] "egg crate") for Chevrolet trucks and black paint over {{portions of the}} GMC grille. Second, an additional trim package was introduced: the Cheyenne. On GMC models, this {{was referred to as}} the Sierra. These packages consisted mostly of comfort features — nicer interiors, more padding and insulation, carpet, chrome trim, and upper and lower side molding and tailgate trim. 1971 was the first year for AM/FM radios factory installed. Finally, the front brakes on all light-duty trucks were switched from drum brakes to disc brakes, resulting in much less brake fade under heavy use. While prior C/K half-ton trucks had used a six-lug <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern</b> (6 x 5.5") for the wheels, two-wheel-drive models switched to a five-lug pattern (5 x 5-inch bolt circle) common to Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Cadillac passenger cars. The 1/2 ton 4 x 4 retained the 6 lug <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern.</b> This <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern</b> would remain the standard {{through the end of the}} C/K series (along with the Chevrolet/GMC vans).

5000|$|Unlike the 351C, {{almost all}} 400 blocks used the large {{bellhousing}} <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern</b> {{used by the}} 385 family big-block and were typically equipped with the higher torque-capacity C6 transmission. There were {{a small number of}} 400 block castings produced in 1973 with the dual bellhousing patterns.

For 1972, the compression was reduced through the use of dished pistons. The compression reduced again for 1973 and a new timing set retarded the camshaft timing 6° to aid with reducing emissions. [...] Changes to the cylinder heads for 1975 to add the Thermactor emission system caused the exhaust port to be more restrictive than the earlier 1971-74 heads. The 400 was retuned by Ford in 1975 to use unleaded gasoline with the addition of catalytic converters to the exhaust system.|$|R

The four-cylinder and V6 shared the same drivetrain components, whereas stronger transmissions were needed for the new 4.0L. The 2.5L also shared an 18mm threaded oil filter used with the GM 2.8L (ACDelco PF47 or equivalent) to 1986; when the 4.0L was phased into production with the XJ the oil filter was changed over to a 20mm thread size shared with Renaults until 1991.|$|R
