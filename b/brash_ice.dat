40|$|A {{mechanical}} system consisting of water covered by <b>brash</b> <b>ice</b> {{and a body}} freely floating near equilibrium is considered. The water occupies a half-space into which an infinitely long surface-piercing cylinder is immersed, thus allowing us to study two-dimensional modes of the coupled motion which {{is assumed to be}} of small amplitude. The corresponding linear setting for time-harmonic oscillations reduces to a spectral problem whose parameter is the frequency. A constant that characterises the <b>brash</b> <b>ice</b> divides the set of frequencies into two subsets and the results obtained for each of these subsets are essentially different. For frequencies belonging to a finite interval adjacent to zero, the total energy of motion is finite and the equipartition of energy holds for the whole system. For every frequency from this interval, a family of motionless bodies trapping waves is constructed by virtue of the semi-inverse procedure. For sufficiently large frequencies outside of this interval, all solutions of finite energy are trivial. Comment: 13 pages, 4 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1503. 0219...|$|E
40|$|Stereo imaging is used {{to measure}} surface waves in two {{different}} experimental setups. First, stereo imaging is used remotely measure waves interacting with three distinct ice types: brash, frazil, and pancake. Along-shore spatial frequency distributions show that pancake and frazil ices attenuate higher frequency waves faster than lower frequency waves, causing a decrease in mean frequency. In contrast, wave propagation through <b>brash</b> <b>ice</b> causes a rapid increase in dominant wave frequency, {{believed to be the}} result a non-linear energy transfer to higher frequencies caused by collisions between the <b>brash</b> <b>ice</b> particles. Total wave energy flux was observed to decrease exponentially in both pancake and frazil ice, whereas total energy flux remained constant in the <b>brash</b> <b>ice</b> due to thin layer thickness. Spatial energy flux distributions also reveal that wave reflection occurs at the boundary of each ice layer, with reflection strongest at the pancake/ice-free and frazil/brash interfaces and weakest at the brash/ice-free interface. These high resolution observations demonstrate the spatially variable nature of waves propagating through ice. Second, efficient flexible-baseline stereo imaging is developed to study boat wakes and Langmuir circulation over range of scale (up to 1000 m 2). Given the difficulty associated with obtaining ground control points over a water surface, determining the exterior camera orientation is generally {{the most difficult part of}} field calibration. The innovative calibration technique accomplishes this using a two step process where exterior orientation is first estimated using a total station and then refined using a series of geometric and epipolar constraints. Processing times are also reduced using phase-only correlation and parallel processing. The first experiment explores the wake patterns generated by boats moving at different speeds. Analysis includes maximum wave height, crest length, wake angle, and interaction with ambient waves. Results processed using the new technique measured a water surface displacement time series to within 1. 2 cm mean absolute error when compared with a wire wave gauge which is on the order of the camera resolution. The second experiment investigates waves in the presence of Langmuir circulation, including orientation of Langmuir cells to wave direction and influence on wave energy.

40|$|Two {{series of}} {{experiments}} were conducted to investigate the heat transfer processes from open channel flow to an ice block {{and an array of}} ice blocks. The first series of twelve tests were conducted to determine the heat transfer rate from the open channel crossflow to a single isolated ice block. During the experiment the ice block was gradually lowered into the crossflow while maintaining a constant volume of submergence. The ice block which initially had the shape of a circular cylinder, changed gradually to the shape of a cone yielding to the thermal erosion by the crossflow. The heat-transfer rate from the crossflow to the ice cone was greater than the rate to a hemisphere and also the rate to a circular cylinder. This higher heat transfer rate associated with the cone is explained by a 'heat-transfer concentration' phenomenon associated with the tip of the ice cone. In the second {{series of experiments}}, a packed array of ice blocks in the tightest arrangement was used to simulate a <b>brash</b> <b>ice</b> cover in the open channel flow. Six tests were conducted. The heat transfer rate from the open-channel flow to the <b>brash</b> <b>ice</b> cover was significantly higher than the rate to a smooth surface.

40|$|Tidewater glaciers are glaciers that {{terminate}} in, and calve icebergs into, the ocean. In {{addition to}} the influence that tidewater glaciers have on physical and chemical oceanography, floating icebergs serve as habitat for marine animals such as harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardii). The availability and spatial distribution of glacier ice in the fjords is likely a key environmental variable that influences the abundance and distribution of selected marine mammals; however, the amount of ice and the fine-scale characteristics of ice in fjords have not been systematically quantified. Given the predicted changes in glacier habitat, {{there is a need}} for the development of methods that could be broadly applied to quantify changes in available ice habitat in tidewater glacier fjords. We present a case study to describe a novel method that uses object-based image analysis (OBIA) to classify floating glacier ice in a tidewater glacier fjord from high-resolution aerial digital imagery. Our objectives were to (i) develop workflows and rule sets to classify high spatial resolution airborne imagery of floating glacier ice; (ii) quantify the amount and fine-scale characteristics of floating glacier ice; (iii) and develop processes for automating the object-based analysis of floating glacier ice for large number of images from a representative survey day during June 2007 in Johns Hopkins Inlet (JHI), a tidewater glacier fjord in Glacier Bay National Park, southeastern Alaska. On 18 June 2007, JHI was comprised of <b>brash</b> <b>ice</b> ([Formula: see text] = 45. 2 %, SD = 41. 5 %), water ([Formula: see text] = 52. 7 %, SD = 42. 3 %), and icebergs ([Formula: see text] = 2. 1 %, SD = 1. 4 %). Average iceberg size per scene was 5. 7 m 2 (SD = 2. 6 m 2). We estimate the total area (± uncertainty) of iceberg habitat in the fjord to be 455, 400 ± 123, 000 m 2. The method works well for classifying icebergs across scenes (classification accuracy of 75. 6 %); the largest classification errors occur in areas with densely-packed ice, low contrast between neighboring ice cover, or dark or sediment-covered ice, where icebergs may be misclassified as <b>brash</b> <b>ice</b> about 20 % of the time.

Sea ice is detectable {{in all of}} the ERTS- 1 MSS bands and can be distinguished from clouds through a number of interpretive keys. Considerable information on ice type can be derived from the ERTS- 1 data. Ice types that appear to be identifiable include: ice floes of various categories, pack ice of various concentrations, ice belts, <b>brash</b> <b>ice,</b> rotten ice, fast ice, leads, fractures, cracks, puddles, thaw holes, and flooded ice. Although larger icebergs can be seen, it is difficult to distinguish them from ice floes. Ice features as small as the small floe of 20 to 100 m across can be detected, and the sizes of features somewhat smaller than 100 m can be measured from enlarged ERTS- 1 prints. The multispectral analysis of the ERTS- 1 MSS- 7 bands provides much information on ice type and ice surface features that cannot be derived from a single spectral band. For example, thaw holes can often be distinguished from puddles because of their different appearances in the two bands. These surface features can be indicative of ice age. Furthermore, snow lines on glaciers can be reliably mapped through the joint use of the MSS- 4 and 7 data...|$|E
40|$|Stationkeeping in managed ice using dynamic {{positioning}} (DP) control {{system has been}} an area of great interest {{over the past few}} years. The stationkeeping performance of a DP vessel depends on the modelling accuracy of the ice forces, which in turn depends on managed ice field characteristics (floe size, floe thickness, inclusion of <b>brash</b> <b>ice</b> and small ice pieces, ice drift speed and direction) and DP system (gain set-ups). Over the years, many engineers have been using numerical and experimental tools to assess the effect of these parameters. More recently, a comprehensive series of experiments with a 1 / 40 scaled DP vessel were conducted in various realistic managed ice conditions in the ice tank facility of OCRE-NRC in early 2015. This paper describes the preparation of managed ice field, the procedure of the model tests and the methodologies of data analysis. The physical and mechanical characteristics of the ice field were modelled by controlling ice concentration, ice thickness, floe size, ice strength and ice drift speed/direction. The ice concentration ranged from light condition (6 / 10 th) to very heavy condition (9 / 10 th+) with three different floe sizes (100 m, 50 m and 25 m). Three different ice thicknesses (0. 6 m, 1. 2 m and 2 m) were used and three different drift speeds (0. 2 kts, 0. 5 kts, and 1. 2 kts) with various heading angles were tested. Some tests used high strength model ice {{in order to keep the}} ice field longer (sometimes for 2 nd day).

This work is a study of the design of a high speed craft, intended for use in the public transportation network in the Stockholm area. Emphasis is put on investigating the consequences of the ice conditions in the area during winter. The work is primarily done as a case study, based on the design of a high speed passenger vessel, intended to navigate in ice. The ice conditions considered are light ice conditions, like <b>brash</b> <b>ice</b> and thin ice sheets. In connection with the high speed craft design, work is done on the eﬀect of the choice of material concept. The scope of the work is as follows. To look into the existing literature on the topics of ice loads on high speed crafts and the use of lightweight materials in the construction of ice-going vessels. Create an initial design of a high speed craft suitable for passenger transportation in the Stockholm area. Gain insight into the ice loading on a high speed craft, and looking into the use of composite and lightweight materials. A literature review on literature related to ice loading of high speed crafts is done. A vessel is brought into the initial design stage, basing the design on a operational proﬁle developed for a suggested route for commuter transportation in the Stockholm area. This high speed craft is used as a basis for comparison of diﬀerent methods for estimation of ice loading. Testing is planned to investigate the ice loading of high speed crafts, based on the operational proﬁle and vessel design. In connection with testing, a loading scenario is created by estimating the expected maximum ice thickness during a winter in the intended area of operation, an impact scenario is deﬁned and work is done with regards to estimation of ice ﬂoe size and modelling of the impact between the vessel under normal operational conditions and an ice ﬂoe. For the testing, full scale hull panels are designed in four diﬀerent materials, both metal and composite. Testing is planned using the deﬁned loading and the designed hull panels.

40|$|The sea ice {{surface is}} {{characterized}} by a varying degree of roughness with partly abrupt transitions. The roughness is caused by edges of ice floes and <b>brash</b> <b>ice</b> as well as by ridges, hummocks and other structures typical for the sea ice surface. It affects the interaction between the ice and the atmospheric boundary layer. This study deals with the parameterization of the sea ice surface roughness and its influence on the transfer of momentum. Based on data from a number of field campaigns during which different meteorological and ice parameters were measured from aircraft, different approaches for the calculation of the drag coefficient {{as a function of the}} sea ice surface structure parameters were compared. For the parameterization of the atmospheric drag coefficient three different approaches were used: (i) relating the drag coefficient to simple geometrical parameters describing the sea ice topography, (ii) partitioning of the total drag into skin and form drag and linking these to ice surface properties, and (iii) high-pass filtering of the surface roughness spectrum and relating the drag coefficient to certain spectral ranges. For the first approach the dependence of the drag coefficients on 10 km averages of the ridge height, distance between ridges, and the aspect ratio was considered. For all parameters statistically significant correlations were found. From the results, it can be concluded that the influence of the aspect ratio on the drag coefficients is more pronounced than the influence of ridge height and distance. The second approach is based on Arya (1975) according to which the total vertical flux of momentum can be expressed as the sum of a skin effect, representing the micro-scale roughness of the surface, and of a form effect which results from the influence of single obstacles such as ridges. Two different concepts of drag partitioning were investigated. Both concepts work fairly well and are slightly superior to the method calculating the surface drag as a function only of the ridge height or of the ridge distance. To avoid the need to define a ridge detection criterion as for the first and second approach, another method was developed which uses statistical properties of the sea ice surface topography to calculate drag coefficients. For this approach, the amplitude spectrum of the sea ice surface topography was calculated using profile segments of 10 km length. To the profiles, a highpass filter was applied in order to remove the larger wavelengths. Different statistical parameters from the remaining part of the spectrum were calculated. The drag coefficient was found to correlate well with rms height of the sea ice surface topography at wavelengths in the range of only a few meters. At longer wavelength the correlation showed only a slight decrease. This behaviour indicates that a larger range of scales influences the transfer of momentum between ice and atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|Various {{types of}} {{remotely}} sensed data and imaging technology will aid {{the development of}} sea-ice observation to, for instance, support estimation of ice forces critical to Dynamic Positioning (DP) operations in Arctic waters. The use of cameras as sensors for offshore operations in ice-covered regions will be explored for measurements of ice statistics and ice properties, {{as part of a}} sea-ice monitoring system. This thesis focuses on the algorithms for image processing supporting an ice management system to provide useful ice information to dynamic ice estimators and for decision support. The ice information includes ice concentration, ice types, ice floe position and floe size distribution, and other important factors in the analysis of ice-structure interaction in an ice field. The Otsu thresholding and k-means clustering methods are employed to identify the ice from the water and to calculate ice concentration. Both methods are effective for model-ice images. However, the k-means method is more effective than the Otsu method for the sea-ice images with a large amounts of <b>brash</b> <b>ice</b> and slush. The derivative edge detection and morphology edge detection methods are used to try to find the boundaries of the ice floes. Because of the inability of both methods to separate connected ice floes in the images, the watershed transform and the gradient vector flow (GVF) snake algorithm are applied. In the watershed-based method, the grayscale sea-ice image is first converted into a binary image and the watershed algorithm is carried out to segment the image. A chain code is then used to check the concavities of floe boundaries. The segmented neighboring regions that have no concave corners between them are merged, and over-segmentation lines are removed automatically. This method is applicable to separate the seemingly connected floes whose junctions are invisible or lost in the images. In the GVF snake-based method, the seeds for each ice floe are first obtained by calculating the distance transform of the binarized image. Based on these seeds, the snake contours with proper locations and radii are initialized, and the GVF snakes are then evolved automatically to detect floe boundaries and separate the connected floes. Because some holes and smaller ice pieces may be contained inside larger floes, all the segmented ice floes are arranged in order of increasing size after segmentation. The morphological cleaning is then performed to the arranged ice floes in sequence to enhance their shapes, resulting in individual ice floes identification. This method is applicable to identify non-ridged ice floes, especially in the marginal ice zone and managed ice resulting from offshore operations in sea-ice. For ice engineering, both model-scale and full-scale ice will be discussed. In the model-scale, the ice floes in the model-ice images are modeled as square shapes with predefined side lengths. To adopt the GVF snake-based method for model-ice images, three criteria are proposed to check whether it is necessary to reinitialize the contours and segment a second time based on {{the size and shape of}} model-ice floe. In the full-scale, sea-ice images are shown to be more difficult than the model-ice images analyzed. In addition to non-uniform illumination, shadows and impurities, which are common issues in both sea-ice and model-ice image processing, various types of ice (e. g., slush, brash, etc.), irregular floe sizes and shapes, and geometric distortion are challenges in seaice image processing. For sea-ice image processing, the “light ice” and “dark ice” are first obtained by using the Otsu thresholding and k-means clustering methods. Then, the “light ice” and “dark ice” are segmented and enhanced by using the GVF snake-based method. Based on the identification result, different types of sea-ice are distinguished, and the image is divided into four layers: ice floes, brash pieces, slush, and water. This then makes it possible to present a color map of the ice floes and brash pieces based on sizes. It also makes it possible to present the corresponding ice floe size distribution histogram...|$|E
40|$|With the ice cap {{diminishing}} rapidly on the Arctic Sea, {{the opportunity}} of using the Northern Sea Route (NSR) increases correspondingly. However, the climate and presence of ice on the NSR sets additional requirements, which represent an additional investment cost for the ship owner who s potentially willing to use the NSR. These additional investment costs, mainly represented by the ice classification, may be up to 12 % higher on total ship cost, depending on ice class, see Polach, Janardanan, and Ehlers (2012). These estimates are however uncertain, as are many other specifics of operating on the NSR; the degree of ice presence, the future fee cost on the NSR, insurance and additional maintenance cost together with varying operational time on the NSR. Numerous of assessments to determine the potential cost advantage of using the NSR as a transit route have been conducted throughout the recent years. These are, however conflicting in their conclusions and a final {{answer to the question}} is therefore lacking. Therefore, this thesis presents a decision support model (DSM) {{that can be used to}} support and assess the question of using the NSR or not based on own costs and available information. The DSM takes into account amongst others; ice conditions, the vessels parameters and its performance in ice, the operational window on the NSR, the initial investment cost of the vessel, and finally the operational and voyage costs. All these variables are changeable, and therefore the potential user of the DSM can alter them and see its effect on the calculated output, which are, amongst others: the ship merit factor (SMF), the life cycle cost (LCC) and the required freight rate (RFR). In addition to the developed DSM, a scenario where investing in a new ice classed vessel for use on the NSR in the summer season when there is less ice, and navigating the Suez Canal Route (SCR) the remaining annual operational time is presented. Through a brief assessment on the cargo flow between East-Asia and Europe, it was decided to implement the DSM for container shipping, as this is the main traffic on the route which could benefit from the shorter distance provided by the NSR. Based on this decision, how to combine the fixed schedule of liner shipping with the uncertainty of the NSR has been discussed. Here it has been concluded that the best way to combine the two routes for liner shipping is to slow steam the NSR when the ice conditions are favourable. Furthermore, the design requirements for ships navigating on the NSR have been reviewed in addition to the limiting parameters and constraints of the route. These and other special requirements for NSR navigation have been summarized and compared versus the open water requirements of the SCR. In order to implement performance in ice and open water into the DSM, prediction methods for <b>brash</b> <b>ice</b> resistance, net thrust and open water resistance have been studied. These formulas, in addition to schedule, fuel, operational and voyage costs, cargo amounts and other calculations have been implemented in the DSM. With the DSM developed, it has been evaluated through sensitivity calculations to ensure that it behaves reasonable when input parameters are altered. Moreover, two case studies have been conducted, both using the established scenario of using the NSR in addition to the SCR. In the first case study, the performance of a SCR vessel fitted with an ice class and the other requirements needed is assessed for the different ice classes of the Finnish Swedish Ice Class Rules (FISCR). In the second case study, the possibility of optimizing the design of the first case study to fit the schedule and route better, and thus yield more profit, is investigated through the DSM. Under the given assumptions and input used, all the FSICR classed vessels are found to be more profitable using the NSR in the summer season than the same vessel without ice class navigating only the SCR. However, with the profitability declining as the ice extent and thickness grows, the dictating element on NSR profitability is the ice conditions. The 1 A ice classed vessel have been found to be the best alternative of the FSICR vessels, when also taking into consideration the ice capabilities of the 1 A ice class with respect to ice thickness. Results of the second case study show that having an optimized vessel for the specific route and schedule is important in order to maximize profit as the optimized 1 A ice classed vessel show better performance in all calculated results and ice scenarios. The economic advantage of using the NSR under the given scenario is however marginal. And the potential user of the NSR must therefore take into account the additional risk and uncertainty in terms of ice navigation and unforeseen expenses of using the NSR, before making the final decision. With increasing traffic over the recent years, it is well established that using the NSR is technically feasible. Nevertheless, in order to have shipping on the NSR on a regular basis, one must first and foremost have ice conditions that permit safe, economic and consistent navigation. Secondly, there must be a consistent fee system, which does not take away the benefit of the shorter distance in addition to shorter lead-time for booking NSR assistance. With these prerequisites in place, use of the NSR can be beneficial financially and in terms of reduced emissions...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{observation}} of sea ice {{is a major}} topic in remote sensing due {{to the difficulty of}} performing frequent in situ expeditions [1, 2]. Monitoring of sea ice is important for many environmental issues [1]. First of all, it is a sensitive climate indicator and it {{plays an important role in}} global climate systems. It restricts the exchange of heat and chemical constituents between ocean and atmosphere acting as an insulator. Moreover, it influences global climate system for effects related with its elevated albedo, reducing the amount of solar radiation absorbed at the Earth’s surface. On the other hand, sea ice affects oceanic circulation directly by the rejection of salt to the underlying ocean during ice growth, that is responsible for deep water formation. Besides these, the possibility and safety of navigation in Polar Regions is severely influenced by the presence of sea ice. SAR: Microwave sensors and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are very valuable for monitoring of sea ice since they can acquire information in absence of solar illumination (i. e. during Polar nights) and with almost any weather conditions. Unfortunately, the description of the backscattering behaviour of sea ice is particularly challenging. For this reason, many scientists moved toward systems able to increase the amount of information acquired. In this context, polarimetry plays a key role, because it is able to enhance the discrimination capability of the observed target, solving many ambiguities revealed in single polarisation images [3]. Specifically, sea-ice could be modelled as a layered media showing several interfaces: air-snow, snow-ice and (eventually) ice-water [4, 2]. SAR polarimetry: A scattering (Sinclair) matrix [S] can be used to characterise the polarimetric behaviour of deterministic targets [3]. A scattering vector k can be obtained rearranging the elements of the scattering matrix. The Pauli basis was widely exploited to rearrange the scattering matrix in what is defined as the Pauli scattering vector k = [HH +VV, HH-VV, 2 HV], where H stands for linear horizontal and V for linear vertical and the repeated letter is for transmitter-receiver. A target that pixel per pixel changes its polarimetric behaviour (i. e. scattering matrix) is defined ”partial” and can be characterised with the second order statistics of the scattering vector. The latter are generally arranged in a covariance matrix [C]. Sea-Ice classification with SAR polarimetry: This paper will compare three different classification methodologies that make advantage of polarimetric SAR data. 1) The first considers the estimation of “polarimetric observables” (ratios and coherences between polarimetric channels) to build a feature vector able to separate the different ice types (and open water) on a multidimensional space. This approach was largely adopted in the literature and its value is a consequence of the choice of observables that physically should capture the different behaviour of ice types and open water [2, 5, 6]. 2) The Wishart classifier for the covariance matrix [C]. This approach is based on the statistical distance (in the covariance matrix space) of the pixel from the different classes. The supervised version makes use of a first step where a Cloude-Pottier decomposition is performed [3]. The latter was already exploited in some occasions for sea ice classification [7]. 3) The classifier based on the perturbation analysis [8]. This recent classifier will be tested here since in some conditions showed improvements on the Wishart classifier. Specifically, the overall intensity of the backscattering is neglected and this is beneficial in situations where a modulation of the intensity may not be related to physical but rather geometrical phenomena. The three methodologies will be carefully compared in order to understand which the best methodology for the different situations is. Dataset used: The dataset exploited in this study was acquired during the ICESAR campaign in 2007 by the E-SAR airborne system of DLR (German Aerospace Agency). The sea ice acquisitions were carried out in Svalbard over three different locations: Fram Strait, Storfjord and Barents Sea. In this analysis only L-band acquisitions are used, since they are the only one presenting quad-polarimetric data. The resolution of the system is 2. 12 m in slant-range and about 1 m in azimuth with a pixels spacing of 1. 5 m in range and 0. 5 m in azimuth. The NESZ goes from - 30 dB to - 35 dB, while the incidence angle from 26 to 65 degrees. Aerial photographs of the area during the acquisition show that first year ice is present, with areas of <b>brash</b> <b>ice.</b> Few small leads are also visible. Discussion: As a final remark, the results that will be presented show that polarimetry could help the data analysis solving eventual ambiguities. However, in many instances, the refrain in exploiting polarimetric modes is the impossibility to achieve very large swath (as ScanSAR images) that in many sea-ice applications are needed to cover vast areas in short time. Fortunately, in the next generations of SAR satellites this inconvenient may be bypassed by the possibility to use compact polarimetry (as for the RADARSAT constellation) or dual polarimetry (as for the Sentinel constellation) with ScanSAR modes. In particular, compact polarimetry somehow allows reconstructing quad-polarimetric data, although part of the information will be clearly lost. References: [1] S. Sandven, Johannessen, O.
