He tells him that he would not have chosen John as her husband, but he accepts it <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that she decides who she loves.|$|E

Moss's plan requires Aaronow {{to break into the}} office, stage a burglary and steal all of the prime leads. Aaronow wants no part of the plan, but Moss tries to coerce him, saying that Aaronow is already an accessory before the fact simply <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> about the proposed burglary.|$|E

25|$|Tom Yorkfield, a farmer, {{receives}} {{a visit from}} his half-brother Laurence. Tom has no great liking for Laurence or respect for his profession as a painter of animals. Tom shows Laurence his prize bull and expects him to be impressed, but Laurence nonchalantly tells Tom that he has sold {{a painting of a}} different bull, which Tom has seen and does not like, for three hundred pounds. Tom is angry that a mere picture of a bull should be worth more than his real bull. This and Laurence's condescending attitude give him the urge to strike him. Laurence, running away across the field, is attacked by the bull, but is saved by Tom from serious injury. Tom, looking after Laurence as he recovers, feels no more rancour <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that, however valuable Laurence's painting might be, only a real bull like his can attack someone.|$|E
25|$|The heroes {{enter the}} cedar forest. Humbaba, the {{guardian}} of the Cedar Forest, insults and threatens them. He accuses Enkidu of betrayal, and vows to disembowel Gilgamesh and feed his flesh to the birds. Gilgamesh is afraid, but with some encouraging words from Enkidu the battle commences. The mountains quake with the tumult and the sky turns black. The god Shamash sends 13 winds to bind Humbaba, and he is captured. The monster pleads for his life, and Gilgamesh pities him. He offers Gilgamesh to be king of the forest, he will cut the trees for him, and be his slave. Enkidu, however, is enraged and asks Gilgamesh to kill the beast, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that Humbaba is lying. Humbaba curses them both and Gilgamesh dispatches him with {{a blow to the}} neck. The two heroes cut down many cedars, including a gigantic tree that Enkidu plans to fashion into a gate for the temple of Enlil. They build a raft and return home along the Euphrates with the giant tree and the head of Humbaba.|$|E

Inaros trains soldiers for the Persian army, but has {{never thought of}} rebellion <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> the Persians are much stronger than the Egyptians. The only thing that gives him comfort is his lover Meritaton. However, when Megabyzus abducts Meritaton, Inaros is moved to begin a rebellion. As news of the rebellion spreads throughout Egypt, Megabyzus begins slaughtering innocent citizens. Inaros heads to Elbo to recruit the Nubians, and then to Libya to urge the Libyans to join him.

In the episode, Homer accidentally saves the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant from meltdown by arbitrarily choosing the emergency override button via a counting rhyme.

500|$|In Planet Simpson, Chris Turner quotes Bart's {{revelation to}} Lisa that {{he sold his}} soul to Milhouse for five dollars and used {{the money to buy}} sponges shaped like dinosaurs. After Lisa criticizes Bart for selling his soul, Bart responds: [...] "Poor gullible Lisa. I'll keep my crappy sponges, thanks." [...] Turner comments: [...] "Here Bart is the epitome of the world-weary hipster, using the {{degraded}} language of modern marketing to sell off the most sacred parts of himself <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that some cheap sponge is more real, hence more valuable, than even the loftiest of abstract principles." ...|$|E

500|$|The Greene Knight {{tells the}} same story as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, with a few differences. Notably, the knight, here named [...] "Bredbeddle", is only wearing green, not green-skinned himself. The poem also states the knight has been asked by his wife's mother (not Morgan in this version) to trick Gawain. He agrees <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> his wife is {{secretly}} in love with Gawain, and hopes to deceive both. Gawain falters in accepting a girdle from her, and the Green Knight's purpose is fulfilled in a small sense. In the end, he acknowledges Gawain's ability and asks to accompany him to Arthur's court.|$|E

Alexandra reassured her that she was as dearly loved as her siblings. At age eleven, Maria apparently developed a painful crush on one of the young men she had met. [...] "Try not to let your thoughts dwell too much on him, that's what our Friend said," [...] Alexandra wrote to her on December 6, 1910. Alexandra advised her third daughter to keep her feelings hidden because others might say unkind things to her about her crush. [...] "One must not let others see what one feels inside, when one knows it's considered not proper. I know he likes you as a little sister and would like to help you not to care too much, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> you, a little Grand Duchess, must not care for him so." ...|$|E

In another storyline, Kylie makes a pass at Steve. Steve decides not to tell Becky <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> Kylie will take Max away, as she is trouble. Kylie plays on the fact Becky is desperate for a child and offers to sell Max to her. Gregson said he felt it immoral to buy a child, but stressed [...] "Kylie isn‚Äôt an ordinary mother‚Äì she only cares about herself." [...] He said that Steve believes Max {{would be better off}} with him and Becky. Steve is first to take Kylie seriously, Gregson believed this was because Kylie has [...] "proved herself ruthless" [...] and [...] "not the best mum".

Though Mori possesses a strength and fury that should serve well against the Kaiju, Pentecost is reluctant to use her, partly because of a fatherly bond and partly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> she is still fighting the terror of her childhood. Del Toro stated: [...] "I was very careful how I built the movie. One {{of the other things}} I decided was that I wanted a female lead who has the equal force as the male leads. She's {{not going to be a}} sex kitten, she's not going to come out in cutoff shorts and a tank top, and it's going to be a real earnestly drawn character." [...] Noting that the other actors were exhausted and [...] "destroyed physically" [...] by filming in the intensive Jaeger cockpit harnesses, del Toro said: [...] "The only one that didn't break was Rinko Kikuchi, the girl. She never complained‚Ä¶ I asked Rinko her secret and she said 'I think of gummi bears and flowers.' I try to do that in my life now." [...] Mana Ashida plays Mako as a child.|$|E

On the topic, Rhimes elabroated, [...] "The interns are residents now, with interns of their own. Except for George, poor George, who is stuck repeating his intern year. It's not easy being a repeater. He's the only who hasn't gone through any change when we begin the episode. But by the end, he has. He tells Izzie that he loves her too. Which takes guts. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> what he is getting into. He's a married man with a great wife, and he never intended to be a married man who loved another woman." [...] Regarding Meredith's story arc, Rhimes felt that she cannot deal with all that is expected of her in her relationship with Shepherd, choosing their genuine love as the greatest obstacle in their decision to break up. [...] Writing for Yang's storyline, Rhimes focused on her unsuccessful attempts at moving on, exposing her devastation at the realization of Burke's departure, which would be the main seasonal storyline for the character. The episode also deals with Sloan and Shepherd's path to reconciliation. Rhimes disclosed that the concept for the plot point was to have the two characters go back to being friends, as a result of Montgomery's departure. Rhimes offered her insight on Lexie's arrival, [...] "Lexie Grey is here now. And she's here to stay. I love that she's a bit of a dork. Being a dork myself, I am fond of the girls with verbal diarrhea. Because it's not easy to keep all your words in, believe me." [...] Regarding Webber and Bailey's storyline, Rhimes noted that the latter's intentions are not to let the former [...] "off the hook" [...] for choosing Torres over her for the position of Chief Resident, which was righteously hers. Rhimes highlighted the unfairness in Webber's choice, noting his unusual manner of comprehending the situation. [...] "She's Bailey. She's worked hard, she's been the best. And isn't it just like the Chief to decide what is best for her? It's his flaw, the Chief. He's an old school man and like an old school man, he's taking care of his women. Whether they like it or not. This isn't gonna be an easy pill for Bailey to swallow." ...|$|E
