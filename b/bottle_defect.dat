40|$|Several {{kinds of}} defects {{that occur in}} bottle {{industry}} will reduce efficiency of bottle production. The defective bottle products are caused by several factors, such as human error, compositions, faults in temperature and machinery setting. From such those errors, faults in temperature and machinery setting often occur during bottle fabrication. This research aims to simulate bottle fabrication by using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) and being used to predict loading mark <b>bottle</b> <b>defect.</b> The {{results indicate that the}} temperature range in counter blow process should be 600 - 800 Â°C and {{in order to reduce the}} inhomogeneous parison temperature distribution the proper air velocity should be 0. 1 m/s. The inhomogeneous parison temperature distribution at the contact area between parison and blank mold may lead to the presence of loading mark. Based on the simulation results, the loading mark is likely to take place at the shoulder and neckring of the bottle...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} {{motivated}} from finding a complementary way of tuning and controlling the machine parameters of Injection Stretch Blow Molding process. In the current approach, a specialized technician detects the <b>bottle</b> <b>defects</b> by visual inspection and corrects the machine parameters using its own experience or indications obtained by previous statistical analyses. As all human based operations, inherent limitations {{are that the}} results {{are influenced by the}} operator skills; in addition, the experience can be hardly converted into a database, which could be used for the process optimization. The solution investigated in this work is to replace visual inspection with an image processing system. A prototype for offline analyses of PET bottles was designed {{in order to have a}} resolution allowing to identify the most common <b>bottle</b> <b>defects.</b> The acquired images were analyzed with algorithms implemented in LabVIEW. Results showed that this system can off-center gate, haze and pearlescence with a repeatability and reproducibility sufficient for the identification of <b>bottles</b> with manufacturing <b>defects...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a vision-based approach for fault detection for the empty water bottles. The goal of our {{approach is to}} find all defects in the empty water bottles. The main constraint is the real time operation as the bottles move continuously on the conveyer belt. Using images obtained from the camera, we first find {{the position of the}} bottle in the image by generalized Hough transform. Then we check the <b>bottles</b> for any <b>defects</b> or presence of alien objects using rectangular and circular areas intensity inspection. The <b>bottles</b> with any <b>defects</b> are rejected and so separated from the main stream. In the statistics obtained, our inspection system successfully rejected all the faulty or <b>defected</b> <b>bottles.</b> The good bottle rejection rate was also lower than 1 % {{of the total number of}} bottles inspected. This system can be used for inspecting any type of empty <b>bottles</b> for <b>defects</b> or presence of alien objects...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Improper wash of reused {{bottles in}} beer and soft drink {{production}} plants {{can result in}} high cost of production and potentially dangerous health hazard to customers. It is shown that when machines are used {{over a period of}} time, they are not able to perform at their best, for which there are many root causes. This paper developed a mathematical model to predict and monitor the amount of Dirt Defect and Caustic Residue Defect in a washed bottle in a beverage bottling company. In this work, a 23 factorial design is applied to investigate the effect of Pressure, Temperature and Caustic soda concentration, on two washing responses namely: bottles with Caustic Residue <b>Defect</b> and <b>bottles</b> with Dirt <b>Defect.</b> A model was generated for the washing responses to the washing variables. The generated models can be used to aid the quality improvement and reliability in the washed bottles for the beverage companies in Ghana...|$|R
