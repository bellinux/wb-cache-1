5000|$|Another {{approach}} {{that has been}} used is a <b>sliding</b> <b>box</b> algorithm, in which each box is slid over the image overlapping the previous placement. Figure 2b illustrates the basic pattern of scanning using a <b>sliding</b> <b>box.</b> The fixed grid approach {{can be seen as a}} <b>sliding</b> <b>box</b> algorithm with the increments horizontally and vertically equal to [...] <b>Sliding</b> <b>box</b> algorithms are often used for analyzing textures in lacunarity analysis and have also been applied to multifractal analysis ...|$|R
25|$|The flapamba is {{a musical}} {{instrument}} in the percussion family. It consists of tuned wooden bars pinched on one side (over the node), and mounted over resonator <b>boxes.</b> <b>Sliding</b> the bars slightly forward or backward affects their tuning. Unlike marimba or xylophone however, the sound is not as focused tonally, {{as it is a}} bit more percussive (closer to tuned log drums).|$|R
5000|$|Another Balaban {{innovation}} was {{to provide}} free tickets to orphans, the aged, and the handicapped, particularly during slow periods before the Christmas holidays. [...] And he provided a club room for the ushers, a recreation room for the musicians, {{and the start of}} First Aid Rooms in all future B&K theatres with a trained attendant. Additionally there was a playroom for children—again with a trained attendant, a sand <b>box,</b> <b>slide,</b> and toys—and a free checking service for suitcases and parcels.|$|E
5000|$|Most machine slides {{for many}} decades, and many even today, were simple-but-accurate cast iron linear bearing surfaces, {{such as a}} {{dovetail}} slide or <b>box</b> <b>slide,</b> with an Acme leadscrew drive. With just a simple nut, some backlash is inevitable. On manual (non-CNC) machine tools, the way that machinists compensate for the effect of backlash is to approach all precise positions using the same direction of travel. This means that {{if they have been}} dialing left, and now they want to move to a rightward point, they move rightward all the way past it and then dial leftward back to it. The setups, tool approaches, and toolpaths are designed around this constraint.|$|E
50|$|Go To The Devil And Shake Yourself (2012) was {{a concept}} album documenting {{the history of}} the papacy. By the time of its release Gilchrist had left to be {{replaced}} by Andy Crowe on bass, and Kate Arnold had left to form Fear Of The Forest, teaming up again with Sergeant Buzfuz producer and ex-cellist Jon Clayton. Murphy and Polly MacLean, singer with Slate Islands, performed the album for sixteen nights at the Edinburgh Free Fringe in 2012. In the same year, Crowe left and was replaced by George Brufton on bass who played on, but left before the release of, 2015's Balloons For Thin Linda. By the time of release the band had expanded to a seven piece line-up with Polly MacLean on backing vocals, Stu Crane on electric cigar <b>box</b> <b>slide</b> guitar and Joss Cope (Biff Bang Pow!, Crash, brother of Julian Cope) on bass.|$|E

To get {{a box of}} noodles, she slips the computer into a slot. The price registers in the computer and the noodle <b>box</b> <b>slides</b> down a chute. When she reaches the cashier, {{there is no need}} to wait while the prices of individual items are rung up. She simply pays the total displayed on the computer's windowed forehead.|$|R

30|$|The dark box uses a {{rail system}} to slide over the table, {{enabling}} animal placement. The sliding mechanism {{consists of a}} U-profile mounted on the box and rails ⑧ mounted on the table that contains the XYZ stage to move the bed mounted at the front side of the U-SPECT. When the <b>box</b> <b>slides</b> to its closed position, it is lowered by about 1 cm. In this way, the U profiles lock over the rails. Blackboard paint has been applied on the rails and the U-profile to ensure the light tightness in locked position.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} factors {{affecting}} the shear strength of granular materials {{by means of}} the tilt box test. The test involves the titling of a specifically designed split-box and measuring the angle at which the upper half of the <b>box</b> <b>slides</b> off. This angle can be interpreted as the peak friction angle of the sample for a low stress state. Experimental tests and numerical analyses using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) are carried out and compared. The study is carried out for two different materials, a rounded and an angular aggregate. It is shown that rolling resistance is needed to match the experimental results if only spheres are used {{but this is not the}} case for non-spherical particles...|$|R
30|$|An {{algorithm}} {{for evaluation}} of multifractal spectrum by the method of moments is also implemented using <b>sliding</b> <b>boxes,</b> instead of non-overlapping, for covering the measure. The results for these additional tests {{are the same as}} in the previous method for q[*]>[*] 0, but for q[*]<[*] 0, the multifractal spectrum for <b>sliding</b> <b>boxes</b> shows missing undefined values of the spectrum. This is characteristic of some fractals as reported in [28].|$|R
25|$|In the {{reference}} {{frame of the}} interface between two surfaces, static friction does no work, because there is never displacement between the surfaces. In the same reference frame, kinetic friction is always in the direction opposite the motion, and does negative work. However, friction can do positive work in certain frames of reference. One can see this by placing a heavy box on a rug, then pulling on the rug quickly. In this case, the <b>box</b> <b>slides</b> backwards relative to the rug, but moves forward relative to the frame of reference in which the floor is stationary. Thus, the kinetic friction between the box and rug accelerates the box {{in the same direction}} that the box moves, doing positive work.|$|R

However, a recently rediscovered <b>box</b> of histological <b>slides</b> belonging to Sir Charles Sherrington, a pioneer in spinal cord and motor control research, has survived at the University of Oxford since 1936. Sherrington coined the term 'synapse', developed the concept of inhibition in neuronal function, demonstrated the integration of sensory and motor actions of the nervous system, and examined the synaptic activity of single neurons and their integration into neuronal circuits. Here, we explore Sherrington's lifetime of discoveries, with reference to histological specimens from his <b>box</b> of <b>slides...</b>|$|R

40|$|When a {{landslide}} or a debris-flow falls {{in a water}} body, a big wave, known as impulse wave or landslide tsunami wave, can be generated. That phenomenon can be highly destructive and unlikely predicted, involving dams and shorelines. Disastrous past events have been extensively analyzed and experimental studies {{have been carried out}} by different authors, but do not fully account for the description of the phenomenon. In the present study we introduce a new experimental set up installed in the fluvial-morphodynamic laboratory of the GITS team in the Technical University of Catalonia. The experimental device consists of a wheeled <b>box</b> <b>sliding</b> on a steep slope flume, releasing granular material, which enters a 2 D basin.

This paper presents an initial investigation into two simple sowing games, Sowing and Atomic Wari. 1. Introduction Most well-studied combinatorial games can be classified into a few broad classes. Taking and Breaking: Games played with piles of chips, in which the basic move is to take some chips and/or split some piles. They include Nim, Kayles, Dawson's Chess, other octal and hexadecimal games. Higher-dimensional variants include Maundy Cake, Cutcake, Eatcake, and Chomp. Cutting and Coloring: Games played on (colored) graphs, in which the basic move is to cut out a small piece of the graph of the appropriate color, possibly changing other nearby pieces. They include Hackenbush, Col, Snort, Domineering, and Dots and <b>Boxes.</b> <b>Sliding</b> and Jumping: Games played with tokens on a grid-like boa [...] ...|$|R
