25|$|Meat is {{generally}} eaten cooked, but many recipes call for raw <b>beef,</b> <b>veal</b> or fish (tartare). Steak tartare is a meat dish made from finely chopped or minced raw beef or horse meat. Meat is often spiced or seasoned, particularly with meat {{products such as}} sausages. Meat dishes are usually described by their source (animal and part of body) and method of preparation (e.g., a beef rib).|$|E
25|$|Cattle are farmed for <b>beef,</b> <b>veal,</b> dairy, and leather, {{and they}} are less {{commonly}} used for conservation grazing, simply to maintain grassland for wildlife – for example, in Epping Forest, England. They are often used {{in some of the}} most wild places for livestock. Depending on the breed, cattle can survive on hill grazing, heaths, marshes, moors and semidesert. Modern cattle are more commercial than older breeds and, having become more specialized, are less versatile. For this reason, many smaller farmers still favor old breeds, such as the Jersey dairy breed.|$|E

2500|$|Beef is {{the third}} most widely {{consumed}} meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively. In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are the world's three largest consumers of beef; Uruguay, however, has the highest <b>beef</b> and <b>veal</b> consumption per capita, followed by Argentina and Brazil. According to the data from OECD, the average Uruguayan ate over [...] of <b>beef</b> or <b>veal</b> in 2014, representing the highest beef/veal consumption per capita in the world.

40|$|The <b>beef</b> and <b>veal</b> market {{organization}} regime {{is going to}} be strongly reformed by the Mid Term Review (MTR) agreed by the Presidency compromise on 26 June 2003. Actually, the <b>beef</b> and <b>veal</b> supporting aid-system based on various types of direct farmers’ premia will be turned to a single farm payment. Options for partial decoupling can also be applied even regionally depending on member states decision. For Italian <b>beef</b> and <b>veal</b> sector decoupling is a critical issue. The different Italian livestock production systems and the lower financial support because of a partial application of Agenda 2000 make decisions about decoupling a hardly task. Effects of different decoupling options have been analyzed joint to national ceiling reduction. A positive mathematical programming model has been calibrated on the <b>beef</b> and <b>veal</b> sector of Veneto Region. Results show that a decrease in livestock numbers and farmers’ income is mitigated when partial decoupling is applied. A reduction in young cattle price may further compensate the negative impact of decoupling...|$|R

60|$|Men, who are of one blood with sheep, have {{followed}} {{their friends and}} the railway along the river valleys where the towns are. Across the hills the inhabitants are few, and, outside their State, little known. They withdraw from society in November if they live on the uplands, coming down in May as the snow gives leave. Not {{much more than a}} generation ago these farms made their own clothes, soap, and candles, and killed their own meat thrice a year, <b>beef,</b> <b>veal,</b> and pig, and sat still between-times. Now they buy shop-made clothes, patent soaps, and kerosene; and it is among their tents that the huge red and gilt Biographies of Presidents, and the twenty-pound family Bibles, with illuminated marriage-registers, mourning-cards, baptismal certificates, and hundreds of genuine steel-engravings, sell best. Here, too, off the main-travelled roads, the wandering quack--Patent Electric Pills, nerve cures, etc.--divides the field with the seed and fruit man and the seller of cattle-boluses. They dose themselves a good deal, I fancy, for it is a poor family that does not know all about nervous prostration. So the quack drives a pair of horses and a gaily-painted waggon with a hood, and sometimes takes his wife with him. Once only have I met a pedlar afoot. He was an old man, shaken with palsy, and he pushed a thing exactly like a pauper's burial-cart, selling pins, tape, scents, and flavourings. You helped yourself, for his hands had no direction, and he told a long tale in which the deeding away of a farm to one of his family was mixed up with pride at the distances he still could cover daily. As much as six miles sometimes. He was no Lear, as the gift of the farm might suggest, but sealed of the tribe of the Wandering Jew--a tremulous old giddy-gaddy. There are many such rovers, gelders of colts and the like, who work a long beat, south to Virginia almost, and north to the frontier, paying with talk and gossip for their entertainment.|$|E
60|$|The state-room {{had grown}} pretty fast; but {{by this time}} it had {{expanded}} into something quite bulky, and almost boasted a bay- window to view the sea from. So we went upon deck again in high spirits; and there, everything {{was in such a}} state of bustle and active preparation, that the blood quickened its pace, and whirled through one's veins on that clear frosty morning with involuntary mirthfulness. For every gallant ship was riding slowly up and down, and every little boat was splashing noisily in the water; and knots of people stood upon the wharf, gazing with a kind of 'dread delight' on the far-famed fast American steamer; and one party of men were 'taking in the milk,' or, in other words, getting the cow on board; and another were filling the icehouses to the very throat with fresh provisions; with butchers'-meat and garden-stuff, pale sucking-pigs, calves' heads in scores, <b>beef,</b> <b>veal,</b> and pork, and poultry out of all proportion; and others were coiling ropes and busy with oakum yarns; and others were lowering heavy packages into the hold; and the purser's head was barely visible as it loomed in a state, of exquisite perplexity from the midst of a vast pile of passengers' luggage; and there seemed to be nothing going on anywhere, or uppermost in the mind of anybody, but preparations for this mighty voyage. This, with the bright cold sun, the bracing air, the crisply-curling water, the thin white crust of morning ice upon the decks which crackled with a sharp and cheerful sound beneath the lightest tread, was irresistible. And when, again upon the shore, we turned and saw from the vessel's mast her name signalled in flags of joyous colours, and fluttering by their side the beautiful American banner with its stars and stripes, - the long three thousand miles and more, and, longer still, the six whole months of absence, so dwindled and faded, that the ship had gone out and come home again, and it was broad spring already in the Coburg Dock at Liverpool.|$|E
