40|$|This work studies scale {{effects and}} the {{influence}} of characteristic geometrical parameters on the calculated resistance and self-propulsion parameters when an additive bulb replaces the non-bulbous bow of a slow-moving full ship. The finite-volume methods have been adopted in the calculations. These methods solve the complete Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The performed numerical experiments have shown that all the examined additive bulbs improved the resistance and propulsive characteristics of the initial conventional hull with the U-shaped bow. This behavior has been attributed to flow changes around the bow which are convected far downstream. The shortest <b>bulb</b> <b>tested</b> improved resistance, thrust, and power most. Calculated results showed exactly the same trends at model and full scale, which is significant for extrapolating model scale results. Power calculations are sensitive to effective wake fraction estimations. The relevant uncertainties should be considered for quantitative predictions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In the past, ciliated {{receptor}} neurons, basal cells, {{and supporting}} cells were considered the principal {{components of the}} main olfactory epithelium. Several studies reported the presence of microvillous cells but their function is unknown. A recent report showed cells in the main olfactory epithelium that express the transient receptor potential channel TrpM 5 claiming that these cells are chemosensory and that TrpM 5 is an intrinsic signaling component of mammalian chemosensory organs. We asked whether the TrpM 5 -positive cells in the olfactory epithelium are microvillous and whether they belong to a chemosensory system, i. e. are olfactory neurons or trigeminally-innervated solitary chemosensory cells. Results We investigated the main olfactory epithelium of mice at the light and electron microscopic level and describe several subpopulations of microvillous cells. The ultrastructure of the microvillous cells reveals at least three morphologically different types two of which express the TrpM 5 channel. None of these cells have an axon that projects to the olfactory <b>bulb.</b> <b>Tests</b> with a large panel of cell markers indicate that the TrpM 5 -positive cells are not sensory since they express neither neuronal markers nor are contacted by trigeminal nerve fibers. Conclusion We conclude that TrpM 5 is not a reliable marker for chemosensory cells. The TrpM 5 -positive cells of the olfactory epithelium are microvillous and may be chemoresponsive albeit {{not part of the}} sensory apparatus. Activity of these microvillous cells may however influence functionality of local elements of the olfactory system. </p...|$|R

40|$|Pathogenic {{isolates}} of Fusarium oxysporum, distinguished as formae speciales (f. spp.) {{based on}} their host specificity, cause crown rots, root rots and vascular wilts on many important crops worldwide. F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae (FOC) is particularly problematic to onion growers worldwide and is increasing in prevalence in the UK. We characterised 31 F. oxysporum isolates collected from UK onions using pathogenicity tests, sequencing of housekeeping genes and identification of effectors. In onion seedling and <b>bulb</b> <b>tests,</b> 21 isolates were pathogenic while 10 were non-pathogenic. Molecular characterisation of these isolates, and 21 additional isolates comprising other f. spp. and different Fusarium species, {{was carried out by}} sequencing three housekeeping genes. A concatenated tree separated the F. oxysporum isolates into six clades but did not distinguish pathogenic and non-pathogenic isolates. Ten putative effectors were identified within FOC, including seven Secreted in Xylem (SIX) genes first reported in F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. Two highly homologous proteins with signal peptides and RxLR motifs (CRX 1 /CRX 2) and a gene with no previously characterised domains (C 5) were also identified. The presence/absence of nine of these genes was strongly related to pathogenicity against onion and all were shown to be expressed in planta. Different SIX gene complements were identified in other f. spp. but none were identified in three other Fusarium species from onion. Although the FOC SIX genes had a high level of homology with other f. spp. there were clear differences in sequence which were unique to FOC while CRX 1 and C 5 genes appear to be largely FOC specific.

40|$|AbstractThe growing {{popularity}} of traditional medicine and the unrestricted collection of medicinal plants from the wild have put many of the slow growing bulbous plant species {{at the risk of}} over-exploitation and extinction in South Africa. This study was aimed at comparing the phytochemical composition and biological (antibacterial and anticandidal) activities of bulb and leaf extracts of Tulbaghia violacea, Hypoxis hemerocallidea, Drimia robusta and Merwilla plumbea between spring, summer, autumn and winter seasons, with the view of promoting the use of leaves, as a conservation strategy. Antibacterial and anticandidal activities of petroleum ether (PE), dichloromethane (DCM), 80 % ethanol and water extracts of bulbs and leaves were tested against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria and the fungus Candida albicans using the microdilution bioassay. Spectrophotometric methods were used to evaluate saponin and phenolic compositions for the four seasons. Leaf and bulb extracts exhibited comparable anticandidal activity (MIC< 1 mg/ml) in all the plant species in all seasons. Only ethanol and water extracts of H. hemerocallidea corms (autumn and winter) showed correspondingly good fungicidal activity amongst the <b>bulbs</b> <b>tested.</b> Antibacterial activity was fairly comparable between bulbs and leaves with at least one extract of each plant species showing some good MIC values in most of the seasons. The best antimicrobial activities were recorded in winter and autumn seasons, with MIC values as low as 0. 2 mg/ml in the DCM bulb extracts of T. violacea (winter) against K. pneumoniae and S. aureus. The amounts of total phenolic compounds in all plant samples were generally higher in spring compared to the other seasons. Condensed tannin, gallotannin and flavonoid levels, depending on the sample, were either higher in spring or winter except for H. hemerocallidea (corm) which had higher gallotannin levels in autumn. Total saponin levels were higher in winter in all plant samples. Although variation was observed in the phytochemical concentrations between the bulbs and leaves of each plant species, their antimicrobial activities were fairly comparable.

Methods: Samples produced by pressing and extraction of <b>bulbs</b> were <b>tested</b> for their ability to decrease free radicals of 2, 2 ′-azinobis (3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) and the results were compared with commercial preparations of aged garlic and with trolox, butylated hydroxytoluene, N-acetyl cysteine, and gallic acid. We also measured the phenolic content of the extracts and the amounts of diallyl sulfides present. Results: Antioxidant activities were directly related to the contents of phenolic compounds, with the fresh freeze-dried extracts significantly more potent than commercial preparations. Hexane-extracted shallot and garlic had the highest antioxidant activity, followed by water extracts, bulb pressings, and commercial products. Fresh shallot and garlic preparations inhibited lipid oxidation and accelerated their decomposition but had no effect on protein oxidation.

UV light traps caught more mosquitos than the traps with incandescent bulbs, but caught many insects other than mosquitos requiring time-consuming separation, and were un-popular with villagers. Traps placed in living areas of houses caught more mosquitos than those placed beside bednets and the catch mainly comprised species that were active in the early evening. Encephalitis Vector Surveillance (EVS) traps hung outdoors and baited with CO 2 caught few mosquitos.

Aqueous, ethanol and hydro-ethanol extracts of E. humilis <b>bulb</b> were <b>tested</b> for their inhibitory effects on diabetes-linked enzymes (α-amylase, α-glucosidase, maltase and sucrase). This was followed by evaluation of the ability of these extracts to scavenge 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl as well as superoxide radical, and iron chelation activity. Ethanol extract of E. humilis exhibited the most potent inhibitory effect on α-amylase (IC 50 : 79. 12  μg/mL), α-glucosidase (IC 50 : 3. 51  μg/mL), maltase (IC 50 : 37. 69  μg/mL) and sucrase (IC 50 : 30. 09  μg/mL).

We recently showed a loss of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) protein in the olfactory bulb of reeler mutants and advanced {{the hypothesis that the}} Reelin and NO signalling pathways may influence each other. We now studied the distribution of NO sensitive guanylyl cyclase (NOsGC), Reelin and its receptor Apolipoprotein E 2 (ApoEr 2) in the olfactory bulb by multiple fluorescence labelling and tested whether nNOS and ApoEr 2 colocalize in this area. We also essayed the protein content of NOsGC in the reeler olfactory <b>bulb</b> and <b>tested</b> whether there are any changes in nNOS and NOsGC protein in other reeler brain areas. Olfactory bulb interneurons expressing ApoEr 2 and nNOS are only few in the glomerular layer but represent the large majority of granule cell layer interneurons. Conversely, NOsGC interneurons are rare in the granule cell layer and abundant as periglomerular cells. Reelin containing periglomerular cells almost entirely belong to the NOsGC subset. These data further support the hypothesis of a reciprocal signalling between Reelin/NOsGC and ApoEr 2 /nNOS expressing neurons to affect olfactory bulb activity. We also show that a significant rise in NOsGC content accompanies the decrease of nNOS protein in the reeler olfactory bulb. The same reciprocal changes present in the cortex/striatum and the hippocampus of reeler mice. Thus, the influence that the deficit of extracellular Reelin seems to exert on nNOS and its receptor {{is not limited to the}} olfactory bulb but is a general feature of the reeler brain...|$|R

Carotid lesions have been evaluated, taking into account plaque characters (surface, echogenicity), the most severe luminal narrowing, and the number of vessels involved. A large number of vascular plaques has been observed in uremic patients: 73. 8 % versus 44 % in the control group (chi square test = 10. 98; P < 0. 01). A high prevalence of carotid lesions has been found in both patients and controls with clinical evidence of cardiovascular complications. Finally, we have considered the presence of carotid lesions with a topographic evaluation.

Objectives: To determine whether DFTS analgesia results in inadvertent desensitisation of the palmar/plantar digital nerves and whether this depends on the injection technique used. Study design: Crossover experimental study. Methods: The DFTS of 9 horses were injected with local anaesthetic solution and radiodense contrast medium {{using one of the}} following techniques: Proximal (at lateral proximal recess of the DFTS), Axial (axial to the lateral proximal sesamoid bone), Base (at base of the lateral proximal sesamoid bone), and Distal (at palmar/plantar mid-pastern). In total, 72 injections were performed. Skin desensitisation at the heel <b>bulbs</b> was <b>tested</b> with a dynamometer before and at 15, 30, 90 and 120 min after injection. Results: Overall, complete desensitisation of a heel bulb at one or more time points after injection occurred in 22 limbs (30. 6 %). An additional 7 limbs were partially desensitised. Complete skin desensitisation occurred in 10, 3, 4 and 5 limbs using the Proximal, Axial, Base and Distal techniques respectively. Significant differences between techniques were only found at T 30. The probability of skin desensitisation at the heel bulbs was 4 times higher when using the Proximal compared with the Axial and Base techniques in the forelimbs, and 3 times higher compared with the Axial and Distal techniques in the hindlimbs. Skin desensitisation nearly always occurred exclusively on the lateral heel bulb. Bilateral desensitisation only occurred in 5 limbs. Conclusions: Anaesthesia of the palmar/plantar digital nerves with distal limb desensitisation often occurs after DFTS analgesia. A higher chance of desensitisation exists when injecting the proximal DFTS recess. It is advisable to verify skin sensitivity at the heel bulbs after DFTS analgesia to avoid false interpretations about the origin of pain causing lameness...|$|R

As filling materials peat moss and Toresa (wood fiber) were tested. So-called continuous MA films were used, i. e., without laser holes, {{which means that they}} are virtually impermeable to water. The shelf life of plants and <b>bulbs</b> was <b>tested</b> in packages produced from these films after addition of filling materials with different moisture contents. The shelf life was determined in a climate chamber at 23 °C with a high ventilation rate. The same products were packed in traditional packages with microperforation for comparison. The shelf life of bulbs and perennials was extended dramatically from 3 to 4 weeks in the traditional package with microperforation to 2 to 3 months by the use of MA packaging. It was however not the low oxygen level inside the packages that caused this effect but the reduction of water loss by using MA films. In microperforation packages the products dried out completely in 3 to 4 weeks, whereas in the MA packages the products remained turgescent and vital for 2 to 3 months. Sprouting was inhibited by using dry filling materials. The term Modified Humidity Packaging therefore seems to be more appropriate for this type of packaging. To prevent too low oxygen levels inside MA packages it is recommended to use an MA film with a high permeability for oxygen.

5000|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{is one of}} two {{structures of}} the central nervous system where neurogenesis continues after birth. The other structure that undergoes neurogenesis is the olfactory bulb. Therefore, it has been proposed that neurogenesis plays some role in the proper functionality of the hippocampus and the olfactory <b>bulb.</b> To <b>test</b> this proposal, a group of rats with normal hippocampal neurogenesis (control) were subjected to a placement recognition exercise that required proper hippocampus function to complete. Afterwards a second group of rats (experimental) were subjected to the same exercise but in that trial their neurogenesis in the hippocampus was arrested. It was found that the experimental group was not able to distinguish between its familiar and unexplored territory. The experimental group spent more time exploring the familiar territory, while the control group spent more time exploring the new territory. The results indicate that neurogenesis in the hippocampus is important for memory and proper hippocampal functionality. Therefore, if radiation therapy inhibits neurogenesis in the hippocampus it would lead to the cognitive decline observed in patients who have received this radiation therapy. In animal studies discussed by Monje and Palmer in [...] "Radiation Injury and Neurogenesis", it has been proven that radiation does indeed decrease or arrest neurogenesis altogether in the hippocampus. This decrease in neurogenesis is due to apoptosis of the neurons which usually occurs after irradiation. However it has not been proven whether the apoptosis {{is a direct result of}} the radiation itself or if there are other factors that cause neuronal apoptosis, namely changes in the hippocampus micro-environment or damage to the precursor pool. Determining the exact cause of the cell apoptosis is important because then it maybe possible to inhibit the apoptosis and reverse the effects of the arrested neurogenesis.|$|R

Analysis was also conducted on five equivalent conventional inbred lines, breeding lines developed from the same parental crosses as the DH lines, and the original parent lines. The markers have revealed polymorphisms within the parental lines and the conventional inbreds, {{but not in the}} DH lines. We can conclude therefore that these seven lines are true DH lines. Performance of these DH lines was tested in two field locations and compared to commercial check lines. Bulbs from the various crosses were evaluated for eight bulb traits: diameter, height, centers/bulb, ring thickness, number of rings/bulb, bulb weight, soluble solids content, and pungency. Some crosses were detected that yielded significantly greater bulb weight than the check lines. However, these lines also had significantly greater numbers of centers per <b>bulb.</b> To <b>test</b> how these lines would perform in a breeding program, two full diallel analyses were conducted according to Griffing?s Model I, Method 1. The first consisted of a four parent diallel cross using two red DH lines and two yellow DH lines. Bulbs from the various crosses were evaluated for the same eight bulb traits mentioned above. Significant variation was detected for genotypic, general combining ability (GCA), specific combining ability (SCA), reciprocal (REC), maternal (MAT), and nonmaternal (NMAT) effects for all traits except number of rings/bulb, soluble solids content, and pungency. Significant environmental effects were only detected with number of centers per bulb. The second diallel analysis, a four parent diallel with two DH lines and two inbred lines from the breeding program, showed significant variation for the same effects for all traits except soluble solids content. Generally, GCA effects were more important than SCA effects in explaining the variation observed between crosses. For all traits GCA and SCA were always larger than the reciprocal effects (divided into maternal and nonmaternal components) ...|$|R
40|$|PH {{sensitive}} electrodes {{have been}} fabricated using thick film screen printing techniques. Powdered ruthenium dioxide hydrate was incorporated in a printable paste by mixing with an uncured polymer precursor. This paste was printed onto alumina tiles {{which had been}} previously patterned with conductive tracking which enabled connection to measurement circuitry. The liquid polymer was cured to a resistant solid using either temperature or ultraviolet light treatments. Large numbers of electrodes were fabricated in this way, using ruthenium dioxide with varying levels of hydration. Printed electrodes were tested for pH response using a number of fixed pH buffers. A commercial silver/silver chloride reference electrode was used to complete the potentiometric measurement cell. The response of electrodes {{was found to be}} comparable to that of commercial electrodes based upon a pH sensitive glass <b>bulb.</b> Electrodes were <b>tested</b> after prolonged soaking in various solutions, both acidic and alkali. Some types of printed electrode showed signs of chemical attack and failure after storage in acidic media. Charge was passed through electrodes to investigate the possible perturbation of electrochemical equilibria within the oxide. Electrodes were characterised by microscope examination of used and unused samples. The hydration level of the oxide powders used was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis techniques. The electrochemical mechanisms underlying the potentiometric pH response are speculated upon. The experimental evidence could indicate that an ion exchange mechanism involving hydroxide groups on the oxide surface is responsible for pH sensitivity. Results are discussed with respect to this and other mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} olive mill {{wastewater}} (OMW) on growth of tulip plants infected by common diseases {{as well as}} on their new bulbs production is analyzed in this work. Filtered and sterilized OMW was tested as growth inhibitor of Botrytis tulipae, Fusarium oxysporum, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium spp. mycelium. The effect of filtered OMW on uninfected tulip <b>bulbs</b> was also <b>tested</b> {{as well as on}} the growth of bulbs infected with the fungus B. tulipae and A. niger in vivo. The mycelium length, severity of scab-like lesions, plant height (PH), fresh mass (FM) and dry mass (DM) of plants and production of new bulbs were recorded. Only the filtered OMW inhibited the in vitro mycelium growth of all tested fungi. However filtered OMW caused infections when it sprayed on uninfected bulbs, malformations on 30 % of the plants grown from these bulbs and decrease PH, FM and DM as well as new bulbs production at 75 %, 72. 4 %, 79. 1 % and 50 % respectively. The treatment of B. tulipae infected bulbs with filtered OMW reduced further the PH, FM, DM and the production of new bulbs in 92. 1 %, 81. 4 %, 78. 7 % and 97 % respectively. In contrast the treatment of infected bulbs by B. tulipae + A. niger with filtered OMW did not affect PH, FM and the number of new bulbs produced and significantly improved plants DM and the mass of new bulbs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Children whose mothers {{consumed}} alcohol {{during pregnancy}} exhibit widespread brain abnormalities and a complex array of behavioral disturbances. Here, {{we used a}} mouse model of fetal alcohol exposure to investigate relationships between brain abnormalities and specific behavioral alterations during adulthood. Results Mice drank a 10 % ethanol solution throughout pregnancy. When fetal alcohol-exposed offspring reached adulthood, we used high resolution MRI to conduct a brain-wide screen for structural changes {{and found that the}} largest reduction in volume occurred in the olfactory <b>bulbs.</b> Next, we <b>tested</b> adult mice in an associative olfactory task and found that fetal alcohol exposure impaired discrimination between similar odors but left odor memory intact. Finally, we investigated olfactory bulb neurogenesis as a potential mechanism by performing an in vitro neurosphere assay, in vivo labeling of new cells using BrdU, and in vivo labeling of new cells using a transgenic reporter system. We found that fetal alcohol exposure decreased the number of neural precursor cells in the subependymal zone and the number of new cells in the olfactory bulbs during the first few postnatal weeks. Conclusions Using a combination of techniques, including structural brain imaging, in vitro and in vivo cell detection methods, and behavioral testing, we found that fetal alcohol exposure results in smaller olfactory bulbs and impairments in odor discrimination that persist into adulthood. Furthermore, we found that these abnormalities in olfactory bulb structure and function may arise from deficits in the generation of new olfactory bulb neurons during early postnatal development. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cultivation of {{the major}} flower bulb crops, e. g., lily, narcissus, {{gladiolus}} and tulip, is threatened by the soil-borne fungus Fusarium oxysporum. Fusarium infected bulb lots have lower yields and cause significant problems for bulb export and cut flower production. Besides cultivation practices and chemical protection, resistant cultivars {{can play an important}} role in preventing this disease. To breed Fusarium resistant cultivars, screening and selection tests have to be developed and genetic variation in the host and in the pathogen determined. Information about the inheritance can be helpful in selecting the parents with the best breeding value for Fusarium resistance. Clonal screening tests under standardized conditions (e. g., concerning temperature, inoculum concentration and duration of the test) are developed for lily, narcissus, gladiolus and tulip using artificially infested soil or bulbs. By using a clone of a genotype, levels of resistance can be determined accurately. Severity of the disease is mainly observed by using disease ratings or the percentage of diseased bulbs. Partial resistance to Fusarium is present in all four crops. In Narcissus and Gladiolus even species with absolute resistance were identified. Resistant species are used in interspecific breeding programmes with commercial cultivars. Variation in virulence of Fusarium was investigated for f. sp. lilii, f. sp. gladioli and f. sp. narcissi. In all these formae speciales indications for race-formation were observed. Comparison of different sizes of bulbs within genotypes showed that screening immature <b>bulbs</b> is possible. <b>Tests</b> of individual plants in the seedling stage also gave promising results for a more efficient selection system. The use of indirect selection by molecular markers was investigated in the lily-Fusarium interaction. Inheritance of resistance in all four crops was mainly of a polygenic nature. Breeding values of parents determined after diallel analysis correlated well with resistance levels determined in clonal tests...|$|R
