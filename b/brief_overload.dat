50|$|LST {{scheduling}} is {{most useful}} in systems comprising mainly aperiodic tasks, because no prior assumptions {{are made on}} the events' rate of occurrence. The main weakness of LST {{is that it does}} not look ahead, and works only on the current system state. Thus, during a <b>brief</b> <b>overload</b> of system resources, LST can be suboptimal. It will also be suboptimal when used with uninterruptible processes. However, like earliest deadline first, and unlike rate monotonic scheduling, this algorithm can be used for processor utilization up to 100%.|$|E
40|$|Background: We have {{previously}} reported that <b>brief</b> pressure <b>overload</b> {{of the left}} ventricle reduced myocardial infarct (MI) size. However, the role of protein kinase C (PKC) remains uncertain. In this study, we investigated whether pressure overload reduces MI size by activating PKC. Methods: MI was induced by a 40 -minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and a 3 -hour reperfusion in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. MI size was determined using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. <b>Brief</b> pressure <b>overload</b> was achieved by two 10 -minute partial snarings of the ascending aorta, raising the systolic left ventricular pressure 50 % above the baseline value. Ischemic preconditioning was elicited by two 10 -minute coronary artery occlusions and 10 -minute reperfusions. Dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle) or calphostin C (0. 1  mg/kg, a specific inhibitor of PKC) was administered intravenously as pretreatment. Results: The MI size, expressed {{as the percentage of}} the area at risk, was significantly reduced in the pressure overload group and the ischemic preconditioning group (19. 0  ±  2. 9 % and 18. 7  ±  3. 0 % vs. 26. 1  ±  2. 6 % in the control group, where p <  0. 001). Pretreatment with calphostin C significantly limited the protection by pressure overload and ischemic preconditioning (25. 2  ±  2. 4 % and 25. 0  ±  2. 3 %, where p <  0. 001). Calphostin C itself did not significantly affect MI size (25. 5  ±  2. 4 %). Additionally, the hemodynamics, area at risk, and mortality were not significantly different. Conclusion: <b>Brief</b> pressure <b>overload</b> of the left ventricle reduced MI size. Since calphostin C significantly limited the decrease of MI size, our results suggested that <b>brief</b> pressure <b>overload</b> reduces MI size via activation of PKC...|$|R
40|$|<b>Brief</b> {{pressure}} <b>overload</b> of {{the left}} ventricle reduced myocardial infarct (MI) size in rabbits has been previously reported. Its effects in other species are not known.

Results: The MI size (mean ± standard deviation), expressed as percentage of area at risk, was significantly reduced in the pressure overload group {{as well as in the}} ischemic preconditioning group (17. 4  ±  3. 0 % and 18. 2  ±  1. 5 % vs. 26. 6  ±  2. 4 % in the control group, p <  0. 001). Pretreatment with 8 -(p-sulfophenyl) -theophylline (SPT), an inhibitor of adenosine receptors, did not significantly limit the protection by pressure overload and ischemic preconditioning (18. 3  ±  1. 5 % and 18. 2  ±  2. 0 %, respectively, p <  0. 001). SPT itself did not affect the extent of infarct (25. 4  ±  2. 0 %). The hemodynamics, area at risk and mortality were not significantly different among all groups of animals. Conclusion: <b>Brief</b> pressure <b>overload</b> of the left ventricle preconditioned rat myocardium against infarction.
