5|$|The Condemnations at {{the medieval}} University of Paris were enacted to {{restrict}} certain teachings as being heretical. These included {{a number of}} medieval theological teachings, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly</b> the physical treatises of Aristotle. The investigations of these teachings were conducted by the Bishops of Paris. The Condemnations of 1277 are traditionally linked to an investigation requested by Pope John XXI, although whether he actually supported drawing {{up a list of}} condemnations is unclear.|$|E
5|$|Though the Maya Sita motif {{was found}} {{earlier in the}} Kurma Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana (801–1100 CE) where Sita's purity is safeguarded, it is the Adhyatma Ramayana (a part of the Brahmanda Purana, c. 14th century), where Maya Sita plays a much greater role in the plot. The concept of maya (illusion) is an {{integral}} part of the narrative; the best examples being Maya Sita and Maya mriga (illusory deer). Though Adhyatma Ramayana originated in Varanasi in North India, it influenced Malayam (South India) and Oriya (East India) renditions of the Ramayana, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly</b> influenced the Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas (c.1532–1623).|$|E
5|$|Khánh and a {{group of}} younger {{officers}} called the Young Turks—led by chief of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, commander of I Corps General Nguyễn Chánh Thi and IV Corps commander Thiệu—wanted to forcibly retire officers with more than 25 years of service, as they thought them to be lethargic and ineffective, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> rivals for power. Most of the older officers had more experience under the Vietnamese National Army during the French colonial era, and some of the younger men saw them as too detached from the modern situation. The Young Turks had quite a lot of influence over Khánh, as Thi and Kỳ had intervened militarily to save him from a coup attempt in September by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức.|$|E
50|$|The main {{characteristic}} {{of this particular}} human crisis was {{the difficulty of the}} Turkish authorities to apply any rational planning because of the magnitude of the disaster, {{and the fact that the}} majority of the Greek initiatives were undertaken not only by the government, <b>but</b> mainly and <b>most</b> <b>importantly</b> by local authorities, NGOs and individuals.|$|R
30|$|Lastly, <b>but</b> perhaps <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> we have {{advanced}} terrorism forecasting models in two critical directions. Our approach provides the necessary source-target specificity {{required to be}} useful for protecting the target and addressing the source. Second, by leveraging the information on indirect ties in the network, our method is able to predict the occurrence of new terrorist edges. The ability to predict edge innovation is critical from a policy perspective because early warning {{is essential for the}} allocation of security resources that can, potentially, save lives.|$|R

Some States such as Sweden [1], and entire communities [2], have set ambitious goals for reducing road accidents and their consequences. Reaching these goals highly depends on international research, since it contributes to develop and update manuals, guidelines, National and International standards [3 – 8].|$|R
5|$|Pei's ancestry traces {{back to the}} Ming Dynasty, {{when his}} family moved from Anhui {{province}} to Suzhou, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly</b> his family were directors of the Bank of China which later on funded the construction of important projects including the Kips Bay project in New York. They also found wealth {{in the sale of}} medicinal herbs, the family stressed the importance of helping the less fortunate. Ieoh Ming Pei was born on 26 April 1917 to Tsuyee Pei and Lien Kwun, and the family moved to Hong Kong one year later. The family eventually included five children. As a boy, Pei was very close to his mother, a devout Buddhist who was recognized for her skills as a flautist. She invited him, his brothers, and his sisters to join her on meditation retreats. His relationship with his father was less intimate. Their interactions were respectful but distant.|$|E

25|$|Syntagmatic {{features}} {{are related to}} the syntactic relationship between morphological or phonological units. In Izi, every syllable is marked with one or more features of pitch and quality. The three features of quality in Izi are palatalization, labialization, and neutral. They are regarded as syllable features for several reasons <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly</b> since they cause contrast between syllables rather than between individual phonemes.|$|E
2500|$|The near-simultaneous {{discovery}} of sea routes to the West (Christopher Columbus, 1492) and East (Vasco da Gama, 1498) {{and the subsequent}} establishment of trade links greatly facilitated the global spread of Gutenberg-style printing.

25|$|The {{history of}} Dutch {{nationality}} is {{the emergence of}} a sense of national identity in the territory of the Netherlands. Consciousness of national identity was manifested through shared national obligations and rights such as taxation, military service, political and social rights, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly</b> through the concept of citizenship. Dutch nationality was forged through conflict which helped the people of the Low Countries develop a unifying idea of the Netherlander.|$|E

30|$|We {{therefore}} welcome Spencer and colleagues’ [4] timely, thorough, clinically {{informative and}} well-conducted systematic {{review of the}} literature on this topic. The authors conducted an extensive literature review, identifying and summarising the albeit relatively limited evidence base (n[*]=[*] 9 studies after application of exclusion criteria). Their overall aim was to address a number of key clinical questions pertaining to SIPE, with a synthesis of the data regarding epidemiology, risk factors, outcome(s) and effectiveness of treatment. Whilst any outcome analysis {{is only as good as}} the quality of the best data available, their review not only helpfully consolidates the current state of knowledge <b>but</b> also, <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> acts to identify current deficits.|$|R

He personalised the soldiers, and created an atmospheric presentation of the scenes depicted. He also celebrated notable commanders and recognisable figures within his works, a feature that made him popular with those commissioning works.|$|E
25|$|Neutral lipid {{fatty acid}} {{analysis}} of AM fungi is typically {{looked upon as}} a method to indicate energy storage, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> the ratio of NLFA (16:1ω5) to PLFA (16:1ω5) can potentially be used to indicate nutritional status of AM fungi in soils. Energy is mainly stored in AM fungi as neutral lipids in storage structures like spores and vesicles. Because of this NLFA correlates quite well {{with the number of}} spores in a given volume of soil. The ratio of NLFA concentration to PLFA concentration (active mycelia) can then give the proportion of carbon allocated to storage structures (spores, measured as NLFA).|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in confocal imaging techniques have opened new avenues for investigating how synaptic networks evolve over time. These studies have revealed {{not only that}} synaptic structures are motile <b>but</b> also, <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> that a fraction of synapses undergo a continuous elimination and formation process, and that these mechanisms are markedly enhanced by activity. Turnover of dendritic spines was recently demonstrated in the somatosensory cortex upon sensory stimulation. De Paola et al. have now provided evidence for correlated remodelling of presynaptic structures. These results, together with others, indicate that activation of neuronal networks enhances dynamic mechanisms at both the presynaptic and the postsynaptic level, resulting in an increased turnover of synapses and, accordingly, a reorganization of synaptic circuitry...|$|R

25|$|Although the Napoleonic Empire {{seemed to}} be at its height in 1810 and 1811, it had in fact already {{declined}} somewhat from its apogee in 1806–1809. Although most of Western and Central Europe lay under his control—either directly or indirectly through various protectorates, allies, and countries defeated by his empire and under treaties favorable for France—Napoleon had embroiled his armies in the costly and drawn-out Peninsular War in Spain and Portugal. France's economy, army morale, and political support at home had noticeably declined. <b>But</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> Napoleon himself {{was not in the}} same physical and mental state as in years past. He had become overweight and increasingly prone to various maladies. Nevertheless, despite his troubles in Spain, with the exception of British expeditionary forces to that country, no European power dared move against him.|$|E
25|$|Spain {{received}} {{the influence of}} American individualist anarchism <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly</b> it {{was related to the}} French currents. At the start of the 20th century, individualism in Spain takes force through the efforts of people such as Dorado Montero, Ricardo Mella, Federico Urales and J. Elizalde who will translate French and American individualists. Important in this respect were also magazines such as La Idea Libre, La revista blanca, Etica, Iniciales, Al margen and Nosotros. In Germany the Scottish-German John Henry McKay became the most important propagandist for individualist anarchist ideas. Adolf Brand (1874–1945) was a German writer, stirnerist anarchist and pioneering campaigner for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality. Brand published a German homosexual periodical, Der Eigene in 1896. The Irish anarchist writer of the Decadent movement Oscar Wilde influenced individualist anarchists such as Renzo Novatore and gained the admiration of Benjamin Tucker.|$|E

It {{is common for}} fruit and nut trees to be planted in fallow fields {{to the extent that}} parts of some fallows are in fact orchards. Soil-enhancing shrub or tree species may be planted or protected from slashing or burning in fallows. Many of these species have been shown to fix nitrogen. Fallows commonly contain plants that attract birds and animals and are important for hunting. <b>But</b> perhaps <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> tree fallows protect soil against physical erosion and draw nutrients to the surface from deep in the soil profile.|$|R

25|$|On lap 15, Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel {{came into}} the pits. Hamilton rejoined in sixth place but Vettel's fuel pump failed to work {{so he had to}} come in again. Kovalainen came in a lap later while Barrichello was pushing to try and build a gap. Button and Räikkönen pitted on lap 18, the Finn coming out in eighth while Button rejoined in 11th. Barrichello came in on lap 19, the Brazilian had made a lot of ground as he rejoined just behind Lewis after being around 10 seconds adrift. <b>But</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly</b> for Brawn he had jumped the other McLaren of Kovalainen. On lap 24, a lot of smoke was pouring from the rear end of Vettel's car and he retired with a {{suspected}} engine failure. Hamilton was ordered over the radio to try to cool down his rear brakes as the temperature were getting out of control, but he was unable to shake off the challenge of Barrichello in second.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, in 1298, Andronikos was {{in need of}} his cousin's {{military}} {{talent in}} Asia Minor, where the Turks of Menteshe were encroaching once more on Byzantine territory after having been beaten back in 1293–1295 by Alexios Philanthropenos. Philanthropenos had ended up rising in revolt, supported by the local populace which still largely cherished the memory of the Laskarids of Nicaea and resented the Palaiologoi; to prevent Tarchaneiotes, an avowed Arsenite, from following the same path as his predecessor, Andronikos first extracted from him a personal oath of loyalty and then appointed him commander in the southern and most endangered sector of the front, along the Maeander River. There Tarchaneiotes achieved swift success, not only in the field, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly</b> in reorganizing the local administration and ending corruption which had allowed the alienation of the pronoia estates, originally intended for the upkeep of the army, from their rightful holders. Tarchaneiotes seems to have engaged in a reassessment and redistribution of these lands, which was so successful that it resulted not only in an increase in the numbers of his army, but also in the equipment of a small squadron of ships.|$|E
25|$|The 1921 session saw {{a renewed}} {{struggle}} over public education. In the previous session, the far reaching, innovative legislation {{known as the}} “School Code of 1919” was enacted. This act completely reworked public education in Delaware by empowering a state superintendent to set standards, consolidated hundreds of tiny local school districts into countywide districts, established a 180-day school year, and provided for a County board of education to appropriate funding through the county property tax. It was hotly debated then, and only narrowly passed. The opponents were poised to repeal the whole legislation in 1921, but through much effort, proponents managed a compromise, the “School Law of 1921”. It lessened the standards, including the 180-day school year, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly</b> moved the funding from the counties to the state through an income tax. To manage that funding, it replaced the county boards of education with a State board of education and a State School Tax Commissioner. The whole effort was a personal mission of Pierre S. du Pont. He was prominent among those who persuasively argued its passage, {{not only in the}} General Assembly, but in hundreds of small gatherings around the state. And it was his personal $5,000,000 contribution, given over 20 years, which made possible much of the reconstruction of suitable buildings to meet the standards established.|$|E
40|$|The multi {{discriminant}} analysis model (MDA) {{as proposed by}} Altman in 1968 was applied {{to a group of}} failed and healthy banks in Nigeria to ascertain if MDA is a veritable tool to predict business failure in the Nigerian banking industry. Data was gathered for a five year period for ten (three failed and seven healthy) sampled banks. The results show that MDA is a veritable tool for assessing the financial health of banks. As such, it has high predictive power to deduce from a set of these ratios the likelihood of failure or otherwise.

40|$|This paper {{employed}} ratio analysis, and {{in particular}} the multi discriminant analysis model in predicting and detecting failing businesses in the manufacturing and other sectors of the Nigerian economy. Data were gathered for a five year period for eleven firms sampled from the manufacturing, oil marketing and the conglomerates sectors of the Nigerian economy. The result revealed that MDA is a veritable tool for assessing the financial health of firms in Nigeria. Accordingly MDA has high predictive power to deduce from a set of ratios the likelihood of failure or otherwise. It is remarkable to note that the MDA model not only predicts business failure <b>but</b> revealed <b>most</b> <b>importantly</b> that the warning signals of impending failure can be revealed one to two years before the actual failure...|$|R

In The Cigarette Century, Allen Brandt recounts United States Supreme Court case Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., in which {{habitual}} tobacco user, Rose Cipollone, filed suit against Liggett and Myers, Lorillard and Philip Morris in five separate tort cases, citing their cigarettes as the cause of her cancer. During her deposition, Cipollone recounted her smoking history, noting that she switched to Virginia Slims in 1968 because female-centered marking appealed to her. Brandt writes that Cipollone described the cigarettes as “the first cigarette for women only...designed slimmer for a woman’s slimmer hands and lips...and packed in a slim purse pack.” ...|$|R
