5|$|Following the hurricane, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement {{launched}} an emergency appeal for Cuba. The appeal raised $217,498 (1999 CHF) to supply hygiene items, household goods, water purification tablets, and water containers to the 12,000 living in temporary shelters. The appeal asked for repair supplies {{and to improve}} the response capacity of the national society for future disasters. The Cuban Red Cross mobilized over 4,500 volunteers to the affected areas to provide first aid to injured, distribute meals and medical supplies, and collaborate with blood banks. The government-controlled media <b>broadcast</b> <b>system</b> guaranteed repair items, though many people remained in damaged houses {{in the weeks after}} the storm.|$|E
5|$|In a <b>{{broadcast}}</b> <b>system,</b> {{the central}} high-powered broadcast tower transmits a high-frequency electromagnetic wave to numerous low-powered receivers. The high-frequency wave {{sent by the}} tower is modulated with a signal containing visual or audio information. The receiver is then tuned so as {{to pick up the}} high-frequency wave and a demodulator is used to retrieve the signal containing the visual or audio information. The broadcast signal can be either analog (signal is varied continuously with respect to the information) or digital (information is encoded as a set of discrete values).|$|E

Other {{teletext}} systems have been developed to work with the SECAM and NTSC systems, but teletext failed to gain widespread acceptance in North America and other areas where NTSC is used. In contrast, teletext is nearly ubiquitous across Europe as well as some other regions, with most major broadcasters providing a teletext service. Common teletext services include TV schedules, regularly updated current affairs and sport news, simple games (such as quizzes) and subtitles (or closed captioning).|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the threat}} for flooding, local flood {{warnings}} were issued for much of Arizona. Starting at 0100UTC on September30 and lasting until 0600UTC on October6, the Tucson National Weather Service office issued 20warnings and statements including 13 radar-generated updates. In the same time period, the Phoenix National Weather Service office issued 28warnings, watches, and statements, nine of which were flood warnings generated by the Joint Federal-State Flood Warning Office. Although several flood warnings from the Phoenix National Weather Service Office were requested to be broadcast via the Emergency <b>Broadcast</b> <b>System</b> (EBS), which is a national program that provides public warning for such disasters, no warnings were implemented. The reason was that time there was no formal EBS program active in the Tucson area, {{and there was only}} one program request to fill this gap, but that request was denied. The Pima County Emergency Services Director stated that [...] "we just didn't see the need for activating the EBS system." [...] Despite the lack of EBS broadcasts, NOAA Weather Radio claims it did the best it could to provide updated information on Octave.|$|E
500|$|Stevens {{then went}} through the {{justifications}} that were offered by the NCAA. [...] First, although the NCAA claimed that the television plan was a joint venture, he noted that unlike Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia <b>Broadcast</b> <b>System,</b> Inc., the NCAA was not acting as a selling agent and that the sales occurred in a noncompetitive market. [...] Stevens evaluated the NCAA's claim that the television plan enhanced the competitiveness of college football. Since the district court found no procompetitive efficiencies from the arrangement, Stevens rejected this justification. [...] He also {{said that there was}} no need to penetrate the market against [...] "nonexistant" [...] competitors. [...] Stevens likewise rejected the defense that the television plan was designed to protect live attendance, stating [...] " [...] The NCAA's argument that its television plan is necessary to protect live attendance is not based on a desire to maintain the integrity of college football as a distinct and attractive product, [...] but rather on a fear that the product will not prove sufficiently attractive to draw live attendance when faced with competition from televised games." ...|$|E

500|$|Ada devastated {{multiple}} resort {{islands in}} the Whitsundays, in some cases destroying virtually all facilities and guest cabins. The biggest resort, located on Daydream Island, was obliterated, with similar destruction seen on South Molle, Hayman, and Long islands; since most boats docked on these islands were destroyed, hundreds of tourists in these resorts became stranded and required emergency rescue. Based on {{the severity of the}} damage, wind gusts were later estimated at 220 km/h (140 mph). As Ada moved ashore, most homes were damaged or destroyed in communities near the storm's landfall point, including Cannonvale, Airlie Beach, and Shute Harbour. Extreme rainfall totals as high as [...] caused massive river flooding in coastal waterways between Bowen and Mackay. The floodwaters washed out roads and left some locations isolated for days. Offshore, seven people were missing and presumed dead after their fishing trawler encountered the cyclone. Ada killed a total of 14 people, including 11 at sea, and caused A$12 million in damage. The cyclone revealed inadequacies in the warning <b>broadcast</b> <b>system,</b> and served as the impetus for enhanced cyclone awareness programs that have been credited with saving lives in subsequent cyclones.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, a {{follow-up}} entitled [...] {{was released in}} Japan. Designed exclusively for the Super Famicom's Satellaview peripheral, the game would make notable use of a voice <b>broadcast</b> <b>system</b> called SoundLink to provide voice-acting for {{several of the characters}} from A Link to the Past. The game takes place six years after the events in A Link to the Past and it is set in Hyrule's Light World. The game notably lacks a Link character, and instead the player character is known as the Hero of Light. The available player-characters are actually the male and female BS-X avatars that also featured in BS Zelda no Densetsu. The game was divided into four weekly episodes. These episodes were played live, and a voice-acted soundtrack simultaneously ran on the satellite network, sometimes containing suggestions, clues, and plot development for the game currently being broadcast. Each week, the player could only access certain portions of the overworld. Areas shrouded in clouds were unreachable. Two dungeons were accessible per week, however the episode ended only when time expired and not when the player had completed all the objectives for that week. The [...] game could only be played during the set hours because the SoundLink content was central to gameplay (and not stored on the base unit or flash-RAM cartridge in any way), and the timer was based on a real-time clock set by the satellite itself.|$|E
500|$|Bob is {{released}} from prison once again in [...] "Sideshow Bob Roberts" [...] (season six, 1994), and runs for Mayor of Springfield as the Republican Party candidate. He defeats Democratic Party incumbent Joe Quimby in a landslide, but Bart and Lisa discover that Bob rigged the election, leading to another incarceration. Bob escapes from prison {{for the first time}} in [...] "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming" [...] (season seven, 1995), and threatens to blow up Springfield with a nuclear bomb unless the city stops broadcasting all television shows. He is thwarted when he finds out that the bomb itself is a dud, then kidnaps Bart and flies the Wright Brothers' plane in an attempt to kill himself, Bart, and Krusty (who is hiding inside a shack, improvising a performance on the Emergency <b>Broadcast</b> <b>System).</b> This too is thwarted, and Bob returns to prison. In the following season, Bob takes advantage of the prison's work release program, and appears to be genuinely redeemed. In [...] "Brother from Another Series", Reverend Lovejoy declares him a changed man and recommends him for a work release opportunity. Bob is discharged from prison into the care of his brother Cecil, who is Springfield's chief hydrological and hydrodynamical engineer. However, the scheming Cecil, still smarting over his failed audition for Krusty, tries to frame Bob by sabotaging the Springfield Dam. Bob, Bart, and Lisa together stop Cecil and save the town, and both brothers, despite Bob's genuine innocence, are sent to prison.|$|E
