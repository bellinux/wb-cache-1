5000|$|Return to normalcy, {{a return}} to the way of life before World War I, was United States presidential {{candidate}} Warren G. Harding's campaign promise in the election of 1920. Although detractors believed that the word was a neologism as well as a malapropism, coined by Harding (as opposed to the more accepted term normality), there was contemporaneous discussion and evidence found that normalcy had been listed in dictionaries as far back as 1857. Harding's promise was to return the United States prewar mentality, without the thought of war tainting the minds of the American people. To sum up his points, he stated:"America's present need is <b>not</b> heroics, <b>but</b> healing; <b>not</b> nostrums, <b>but</b> normalcy; <b>not</b> revolution, <b>but</b> restoration; <b>not</b> agitation, <b>but</b> adjustment; <b>not</b> surgery, <b>but</b> serenity; <b>not</b> the dramatic, <b>but</b> the dispassionate; <b>not</b> experiment, <b>but</b> equipoise; <b>not</b> submergence in internationality, but sustainment in triumphant nationality." ...|$|R

5000|$|Harding's {{opponent}} in the 1920 election was Ohio governor and newspaperman James M. Cox, who had won the Democratic nomination in a 44-ballot convention battle. His running mate was Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. Harding rejected the [...] "progressive" [...] ideology of the Wilson administration {{in favor of the}} [...] "laissez-faire" [...] approach of the McKinley administration. He ran on a promise to restore the nation's pre-World War I stride, and, through his use of the phrase [...] "Return to normalcy", {{called for an end to}} the abnormal era of the preceding eight years - an era which he saw as tainted by war, internationalism, and government activism. [...] In envisioning the way for the American people to regain that former stride in the new decade, he stated: [...] America's present need is <b>not</b> heroics, <b>but</b> healing; <b>not</b> nostrums, <b>but</b> normalcy; <b>not</b> revolution, <b>but</b> restoration; <b>not</b> agitation, <b>but</b> adjustment; <b>not</b> surgery, <b>but</b> serenity; <b>not</b> the dramatic, <b>but</b> the dispassionate; <b>not</b> experiment, <b>but</b> equipoise; <b>not</b> submergence in internationality, but sustainment in triumphant nationality.|$|R
