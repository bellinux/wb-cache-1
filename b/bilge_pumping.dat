50|$|A <b>bilge</b> <b>pump</b> is a {{water pump}} used to remove bilge water. Since fuel can {{be present in}} the <b>bilge,</b> {{electric}} <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> are designed to not cause sparks. Electric <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> are often fitted with float switches which turn on the <b>pump</b> when the <b>bilge</b> fills to a set level. Since <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> can fail, use of a backup pump is often advised. The primary pump is normally located at the lowest point of the bilge, while the secondary pump would be located somewhat higher. This ensures that the secondary pump activates only when the primary pump is overwhelmed or fails, and keeps the secondary pump free of the debris in the bilge that tends to clog the primary pump.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bilge</b> <b>Pump's</b> {{style is}} post-punk with avant garde and free-jazz influences. Early on, the NME {{described}} <b>Bilge</b> <b>Pump's</b> sound as [...] "unlistenable guff". They have since had various releases on Gringo Records, Troubleman Unlimited and Unlabel, and {{members have been}} involved with artists such as Enablers, Yann Tiersen, Polaris, Prefab Sprout, Felix, Chris Corsano, HiM, and D:Ream.|$|R
2500|$|Both ships {{had several}} {{hand-operated}} <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> that {{worked like a}} modern bucket dredge, the oldest example {{of this type of}} <b>bilge</b> <b>pump</b> ever found. The pumps were also operated by what may have been the oldest crank handles yet discovered; the reconstruction of the cranked pump which was assembled from fragments, including a wooden disk and an eccentric peg, has been dismissed as [...] "archaeological fantasy".|$|R
50|$|The See {{designed}} quadruple expansion {{steam engine}} had cylinders of 9.75 in, 13.5 in, 18.75 in and 26 in with 22 in stroke connected to two opposed cranks each driven by two cylinders arranged in tandem and driving a 7 ft propeller. Steam at 180 lb pressure {{was provided by}} a two furnace steel return tube type boiler 9.5 ft in diameter by 10.5 ft in length. Two Worthington fire and bilge pumps provided water for fire fighting or <b>bilge</b> <b>pumping.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Bilge</b> <b>pumping</b> shares several {{mechanics}} with Bejeweled and Panel de Pon/Tetris Attack. A well, {{six blocks}} wide, {{is filled with}} assorted blocks colored with five, six, or seven distinct patterns. Blocks can be switched only with their horizontal neighbors, and lining three blocks of the same color in a row or column causes them to disappear. Destroying two, three or even four rows {{at the same time}} is particularly effective. Bilging removes bilge water from the ship, where the amount of bilge water decreases the efficiency of the sailing puzzle, {{both in and out of}} a Sea Battle.|$|E

50|$|OT-62 TOPAS is amphibious {{thanks to}} its flat, boat-shaped hull which is hermetical and ensures minimal {{resistance}} when APC is afloat, It can swim after switching on the two electric <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps,</b> erecting the trim vane which improves the stability and displacement of the vehicle in water and prevents the water from flooding {{the bow of the}} APC, and switching the driver's periscope for a swimming periscope that enables the driver to see over the trim vane. There is also a manual <b>bilge</b> <b>pump</b> for emergency use. The <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> keep the APC afloat even if it is hit, is damaged, or leaks. In water it is propelled by two hydrojets, one in each side of the hull, with the entrance under the hull and exits {{at the rear of the}} hull.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{prevalent}} hydraulic pump used in maritime situations in ancient Rome was the <b>bilge</b> <b>pump,</b> which functioned to siphon collected {{water out of}} a ship’s hull (Oleson 1984). The <b>bilge</b> <b>pump</b> was an improvement on the first hydraulic pumps used in antiquity: force pumps. Invented around the early 3rd century BCE, the most primitive design of a force pump consisted of a piston pushing water out of a tube, constructed by soldering individual bronze elements (Stein 246).|$|R

500|$|All ships leak {{and require}} the regular {{operation}} of <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> to stay afloat. If their <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> {{could not be}} operated, the target ships would eventually sink. [...] Only one suffered this fate: Prinz Eugen, which sank in the Kwajalein lagoon on December 22. The rest were kept afloat {{long enough to be}} deliberately sunk or dismantled. [...] After the August 10 decision to stop decontamination work at Bikini, the surviving target fleet was towed to Kwajalein Atoll where the live ammunition and fuel could be offloaded in uncontaminated water. The move was accomplished during the remainder of August and September.|$|R

50|$|The {{report was}} {{critical}} of {{other aspects of the}} vessel's design, including that the outlet of the <b>bilge</b> <b>pump</b> was too close to the water level, and was not protected by a valve to prevent outside water flooding the bilge.|$|R
50|$|The Delta Electric Company was an American {{electronics}} manufacturer {{formed in}} 1913 in Marion, Indiana (after moving from Chicago, Illinois) that produced lanterns, flashlights, automotive and bicycle lighting, battery tubes, horns, horn buttons, light switches, other battery-powered electrical parts, and <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{vehicle is}} fully amphibious, {{propelled}} when afloat {{by a single}} water jet mounted {{at the rear of}} the hull. To prepare the vehicle for water, the driver erects a trim vane and switches on the <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> from within the vehicle.|$|R

50|$|The Lynx is amphibious, {{propelled}} in {{the water}} by its tracks. Before swimming, a trim vane is erected at front, <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> started, and covers mounted on the air intake and exhaust. In practice, crews would close hatches and ford shallow streams at high speed.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} 1943 and 1944, seventy-seven LCM(4)s were built. Outwardly, the LCM(4) was almost {{completely}} identical to a late model LCM(1) - the difference lay inside the pontoon. Here special <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> and special ballast tanks allowed the LCM(4) to alter trim to increase stability when partially loaded.|$|R

50|$|The ship’s wheel, {{steering}} gear and rudder are intact, as are two <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> {{and the main}} winch and capstan.

50|$|The BMD-1 {{is fully}} amphibious, it can swim after {{switching}} {{on the two}} electric <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps,</b> erecting the two piece trim vane which improves vehicle's stability and displacement in water and prevents the water from flooding {{the bow of the}} tank and switching the driver's periscope for a swimming periscope that enables the driver to see over the trim vane. When not in use the trim vane is placed in its laying position {{in the front of the}} bow under the barrel of the main gun and serves as additional armour. There is also a manual <b>bilge</b> <b>pump</b> for emergency use. The <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> keep the vehicle afloat even if it is hit, damaged or leaks. In water it is propelled by two hydrojets, one in each side of the hull, with the entrance under the hull and exits at the rear of the hull. The rear exits have lids that can be fully or partially closed, redirecting the water stream to the forward-directed exits at the sides of the hull, thus enabling the vehicle to turn or float reverse, for example, to go left, the left water-jet is covered, to go right, the right water-jet is covered and to make a 180° turn the left water-jet sucks in water and the right water-jet pushes it out.|$|R

5000|$|His actions {{during this}} {{encounter}} demonstrated his acumen. The ship had taken 85 hits {{in excess of}} five inches just above the water line and was leaking badly. At a key point during the effort {{to keep it from}} sinking, Schonland realized that the pumps for the second deck were inadequate to remove the water, but that the vessel had much higher capacity <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps.</b> So he called down to the engine room to arrange for all the <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> to be pumping at full capacity, and the crew there ready for an immense amount of water. He then opened the hatches to the lower decks. This served the additional purpose of lowering the center of gravity of the ship, thus increasing its stability during the effort to save it.
