It felt like it should groove there. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> couldn't groove without any vocals, so I started humming along with it and that's what happened. The 'shoops' came. But they felt so good, I thought 'Why not?' It doesn't have to mean anything." ...|$|E

Her cover highlights include Vogue Paris (May 1993), Elle (October 1993), and Glamour (six times). In an interview given in July 2004, Moynahan, discussing her early work, said: [...] "It was a crazy world that {{paid a lot}} of money. I liked being a model, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would never last, so I looked into acting." ...|$|E
500|$|Kinsler {{was then}} drafted {{a third time}} by the Texas Rangers in the 17th round (496th overall) in 2003 as a shortstop {{at the urging of}} area scout Mike Grouse. Grouse liked Kinsler's tools, makeup, desire, and gritty approach. In Grouse's {{scouting}} report, he wrote that Kinsler had a great feel for the game, athleticism, solid defensive skills, intensity, and leadership qualities. Grouse knew that Kinsler was probably being underrated by rival scouts who did not know that Kinsler had played with a foot stress fracture while at Missouri, [...] "so [...] really couldn't run like I knew he could. I'd seen him in Wichita the year before, so I knew he was a plus runner. Most people ... didn't know that, so they probably downgraded him. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it,</b> and I wasn't telling anybody." [...] Kinsler, for his part, says: [...] "I thought I was a lot better than a 17th round pick. I thought I belonged in the top 10 rounds." [...] Kinsler nonetheless agreed to sign with the Rangers on his 21st birthday, for $30,000.|$|E

According to music journalist Stephen Davis, although {{the song was}} released in 1971, it took until 1973 before the song's popularity ascended to truly [...] "anthemic" [...] status. As Page himself recalled, [...] "I knew it was good, but I didn't know {{it was going to}} be almost like an anthem ... <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was the gem of the album, sure." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blethyn's {{breakthrough}} {{came with}} Mike Leigh's 1996 drama Secrets & Lies. Starring alongside Marianne Jean-Baptiste, she portrayed a lower-class box factory worker, who after years once again {{comes in contact}} with her illegitimate grown-up black daughter, whom she gave up for adoption thirty years earlier. For her improvised performance, Blethyn was praised {{with a variety of}} awards, including the Best Actress Award at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, the British Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Upon its success, Blethyn later stated: [...] "I knew it was a great film, but I didn't expect it to get the attention it did because none of his other films had and I thought they were just as good. Of course, I didn't know what it was about until I saw it in the cinema because of the way that he works— <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was good. That it reached a wider audience surprised me." [...] Besides critical acclaim Secrets & Lies also became a financial success; budgeted at an estimated $4.5 million, the film grossed an unexpected $13.5 million in its limited theatrical run in North America.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel detailed {{what it was like}} preparing for her character's rape scenes. She explained that it was grueling and that there were only four people in the episode. She found it to be [...] "very work-intensive," [...] emotionally haunting, and voiced that she had trouble sleeping. She elaborated that [...] "these" [...] type of scenes really stay with a person. Riegel and co-star William deVry (Michael Cambias) rehearsed the scenes on their own, which normally would not have been the case. Riegel commented that it definitely required more work than an ordinary episode. Asked if she was frightened of deVry during Bianca's rape scenes, she admitted that she was and that it was a testament to deVry's acting skills. About the uneasiness of the scenes and whether or not she was frightened or intimidated by [...] "the gravity" [...] of the storyline, she stated, [...] "Absolutely, I was. To be honest, I didn't know if I could handle it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was a very important thing to do and that the show was serious about handling it well." [...] She added, [...] "I knew we could reach people, and that it was powerful stuff. I could feel the power of it. And I knew I should put myself through this because ultimately it might help somebody, touch somebody, make people talk about it. And rape is something people should talk about." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was not {{kindness}} {{that prompted}} the offer. It is not true that suffering ennobles the character; happiness does that sometimes, but suffering, for the most part, makes men petty and vindictive.|$|E
