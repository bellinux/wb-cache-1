40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} study the size effect on the nominal strength of imperfect sandwich structures for buckling driven delamination, to quantify this size effect, and to determine its intensity. A secondary objective is to assess the size effect on the postpeak energy absorption, important for judging survival under blast or dynamic impact. APPROACH: Buckling driven delamination is difficult to control in experiments. Thus, the present study relies on numerical simulations using geometrically nonlinear finite element analysis as well as the softening foundation model, which is an adaptation of Winkler elastic foundation. Delamination fracture is modeled by a cohesive crack model. Dimensionless variables are used to cover the entire practical range. RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS:A major question in extrapolating small-scale laboratory tests to full-scale sandwich structures is the size effect. Delamination of the skin (or facesheet) is often triggered by wrinkling instability, which has generally been considered to be free of size effect. The absence of size effect has been inferred {{from the fact that the}} critical stress for buckling generally exhibits no size effect. However, this inference is valid only for the symmetry-breaking <b>bifurcation</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> path in perfect structures.

40|$|A {{concept of}} "critical" {{simplification}} was proposed by Yablonsky and Lazman in 1996 for the oxidation {{of carbon monoxide}} over a platinum catalyst using a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The main observation was a simplification of the mechanism at ignition and extinction points. The critical simplification {{is an example of}} a much more general phenomenon that we call a bifurcational parametric simplification. Ignition and extinction points are points of equilibrium multiplicity bifurcations, i. e., they are points of a corresponding bifurcation set for parameters. Any bifurcation produces a dependence between system parameters. This is a mathematical explanation and/or justification of the "parametric simplification". It leads us to a conjecture that "maximal bifurcational parametric simplification" corresponds to the "maximal bifurcation complexity. " This conjecture can have practical applications for experimental study, because at points of "maximal bifurcation complexity" the number of independent system parameters is minimal and all other parameters can be evaluated analytically or numerically. We illustrate this method by the case of the simplest possible bifurcation, that is a multiplicity <b>bifurcation</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and we apply this analysis to the Langmuir mechanism. Our analytical study is based on a coordinate-free version of the method of invariant manifolds (proposed recently in 2006).

40|$|Spontaneous {{transitions}} from one steady state to another (so called L-H transition [1], internal transport barrier formation [2]), demonstrating typical bifurcational fea-tures, e. g., fast changes of equilibrium parameters (in particular, {{of an average}} plasma pressure), hysteresis, ets., are observed in tokamaks. There are many attempts to ex-plain this phenomenon by bifurcation of transport coefficients, see, e. g., [3]. However, {{there are a few}} experimental evidences that the transitions do not have a local char-acter but look rather like a global change of the plasma state. In particular, transport barriers may appear due to bifurcation of plasma equilibrium. This possibility was con-sidered in [4]. The bifurcatonal mechanism itself was not discussed in that work. The idea that <b>bifurcation</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> can occur without breaking of the nested magnetic surfaces structure was recently proposed by E. Solano [5]. However, there were no cal-culations which would show bifurcational transitions explicitly. In the present paper we demonstrate the existence of multiple solutions to the classical axisymmetric equilib-rium problem for plasma current column. A very simple current profile, which admits analytical solutions, is considered. The chosen parametrization of the problem allows us to reveal the bifurcational transition between these solutions. It is a nonlinearity of equilibrium equation that is responsible for the multiple solutions. Toroidal effects do not play an important role – the main result is obtained for a cylindrical column.

After introducing appropriate function spaces X and Y the problem (∗) can be rewritten ddtu = G(u, α), (∗∗) where G:X×R → Y is given by G(u, α) (x) = u″(x) + f(x, u(x), u′(x), α). It will be shown, for each (u, α) ϵX × R, that the Fréchet derivative Gu(u,a) : X → Y is not a Fredholm operator. This difficulty {{is due to the}} fact that the domain of the space variable x, is infinite and cannot be eliminated by making another choice of X and Y. Since Gu(u, α) is not Fredholm, the hypotheses of most of the general stability and bifurcation results are not satisfied. If (u 0, α 0 ϵ S = {(u, α) : G(u, α) = 0 }, (i. e., (u 0,α 0) is an equilibrium solution of (∗∗)), a necessary condition on the spectrum of Gu(u 0, α 0) for a change in the stability of points in S to occur at Gu(u 0, α 0) will be given. When this condition is met, the principle of exchange of stability which means, in a neighborhood of (u 0, α 0), that adjacent equilibrium solutions for the same α have opposite stability properties in a weakened sense will be established. Also, when Gu or its first order partial derivatives, evaluated at (u 0, α 0), are not too degenerate, the shape of S in a neighborhood of (u 0, α 0) will be described and a strenghtened form of the principle of exchange of stability will be obtained...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this thesis, we study the {{mechanical}} response of elastic polyether polyurethane (EPP) foams by means of experiments, theory, and modeling. The experiments include five loading cases: uniaxial compression along the rise direction; uniaxial compression along two mutually perpendicular transverse directions; uniaxial tension along the rise direction; shear combined with compression along the rise direction; and hydrostatic pressure combined with compression along the rise direction. We use a commercial series of five EPP foams of apparent densities (mass per unit volume of foam) 50. 3, 63. 0, 77. 0, 162. 9 and 220 : 5 kg/m 3. We perform a test for each foam in the series and each loading case. In every test we measure the mechanical response in the form of a stress-strain curve or a force-displacement curve; in several tests we use a Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique to compute the strain fields on the surface of the specimen. For some loading cases, including uniaxial compression along the rise direction, the mechanical response of the three foams of lower density exhibits a stress plateau. This stress plateau has been commonly interpreted as a manifestation of a <b>bifurcation</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> (Euler buckling of the microstruture of the foam), a global phenomenon that encompasses the entire microstructure of the foam at once. In this interpretation, the plateau stress (i. e., the value of stress on the stress plateau) is the eigenvalue associated with the <b>bifurcation</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Nevertheless, our experimental results indicate that a stress plateau is invariably accompanied by heterogeneous, two-phase strain fields, consistent with the occurrence of a configurational phase transition. Thus we argue that the plateau stress is the Maxwell stress associated with the attainment of a limit point (snap-through buckling of a cell of the foam), a local phenomenon which progressively sweeps through the microstructure of the foam. For other loading cases, including uniaxial compression along a transverse direction, the mechanical response does not exhibit a stress plateau, and the stress-strain curves harden monotonically regardless of the density of the foam. The strain fields remain homogeneous, even for the least dense foam. We use our experimental results to calibrate a mean-field model of EPP foams. In this model, a unit cell composed of several bars is cut off from an idealized, perfectly periodic foam microstrusture. The tips of the bars of the cell are subjected to a set of displacements affine with the applied mean deformation gradient, and left to rotate freely. The unit cell is characterized using a few physically meaningful material and geometric parameters whose values may be readily estimated for any given foam. We verify that under uniaxial loading the model predicts configurational phase transitions, stress plateaus, and two-phase fields for low-density foams; a critical point for foams of a critical density; and monotonically hardening stress-strain curves for foams of density higher than the critical density. The critical exponents associated with the critical point are the same as in other mean-field models such as the Van der Walls model of a fluid. With a suitable choice of parameters, the model gives predictions that compare favorably with our experimental results for all loading cases. In particular, the model gives a nonconvex strain energy function where (and only where) the experiments exhibit a stress plateau and two-phase strain fields. We conclude that the mechanical response of EPP foams is dominated at large strains by either one of two mechanisms at the level of a foam cell: snap-through buckling, which leads to nonconvex strain energy functions, stress plateaus, and two-phase strain fields; or bending, which leads to convex strain energy functions, monotonically increasing stresses, and homogeneous strain fields. This conclusion allows us to interpret an extensive series of experiments in which EPP foam specimens are penetrated with a wedge-shaped punch. For low-density foams, we find experimentally that the mechanical response is linear up to a penetration of the punch of about 40 % of the height of the specimen. We surmise that the strain field in the specimen consists of a high-strain phase in a region close to the tip, where a phase transition has taken place, and a low-strain phase in a region far from the tip, where the phase transition is yet to take place. The two regions are separated by a sharp interface, where the strain is discontinuous. We use DIC to trace the sharp interface as it grows and sweeps through the specimen during a test. By studying theoretically the self-similar growth of a sharp interface, we predict a linear response within the self-similar regime, in accord with our experimental findings. We then apply the same theory to the case of a conical punch, predict a quadratic response within the self-similar regime, and verify our prediction by performing experiments with a conical punch. We conclude that in the self-similar regime the mechanical response is ruled entirely by geometry and depends only on the dimensionality of the punch and the plateau stress of the low-density foam. In the second part of this thesis, we study the initial yielding of ultrathin metallic films (thickness of a fraction of a micrometer). Recent experiments indicate that in free-standing metallic films of constant grain size the initial yield stress increases as the film becomes thinner, it peaks for a thickness on the order of 100 nm, and then starts to decrease. This reversing (first hardening, then softening) size effect poses two challenges: (1) It cannot be explained using currently available models and (2) it appears to contradict the little-known but remarkable experimental results of J. W. Beams [1959], in which the size effect in bulge tests did not reverse even for a thickness of 20 nm. We show that the reversing size effect can be explained and the contradiction dispelled by taking into account the effect of the surface stress on the initial yielding. We also predict that the mode of failure of a film changes from ductile to brittle for a thickness on the order of 100 nm, in accord with experiments. Our successful application of methods of continuum mechanics to films as thin as 100 times a typical lattice parameter adds to a growing realization of the robustness of these methods at ultrasmall length scales...|$|E
