40|$|Conceptual {{developments}} are underpinned by the intellectual process of constant reviewing and developing innovative research ideas into realistic design. There exists no one quick fix, {{fit for purpose}} solution to ensure stability of structures being constructed {{on a wide range}} of demanding ground conditions and variety of project constraints. Routine highway design and construction technology conformingly adopt only conventional fill methods and thus fail even to address adequately the less favoured conditions in challenging situations: a high initial construction cost arising from a full replacement of existing unfavourable soil conditions or an unsustainable construction design leading to a condition of rapid disintegration requiring regular expensive and disruptive highway maintenance activity. Undulating road embankment surfaces result from the transference of heavy self-weight of the embankment fill on yielding and non-uniform subgrade such as in peat soils. The Manitoba Water Services Board [1] specifies four classes of fills (viz; common, compacted common, compacted select granular backfill and unshrinkable <b>backfill)</b> for <b>backfilling</b> <b>of</b> pipeline <b>trenches.</b> Both conventional and alternatively sustainable backfills are discussed in this paper with new and appropriate technology opening doors with other tangible benefits for innovative and cost saving outcomes for differing construction scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Underwater {{pipelines}} {{have become}} {{a vital part of}} modern civilisation. Transport by pipeline is relatively inflexible compared to other means of transport, however it consumes less energy. Most offshore pipelines carry oil or gas, but they can also transport water or other fluids. More and more oil and gas is produced from offshore fields. The product has to be carried onshore and that is usually done by pipeline. Pipelines can be laid uncovered on the seabed, or can be embedded in the seafloor when stabilisation or protection is required. Pipelines are primarily covered when they are located in shallow waters. The material used to refill an excavated trench is called backfill. The typical material used as artificial backfill is coarse granular soil (rock, gravel, or coarse sand). When there is no suitable backfill material available close to the pipeline route, then material has to be transported from another location. A subsea pipeline should remain stable during its entire lifetime. Normal engineering practice focuses on the operational phase, while the installation phase is almost neglected. However, this study focuses on the installation phase and particularly on dredge-based backfilling. Dredge-based backfilling means using the suction pipe of a Trailing Suction Hopper Dredger (TSHD) as discharge pipe. It is not always clear if a particular soil can be used as backfill material. In the past this lack of knowledge resulted a few times in pipeline floatation during the installation phase. This lack of knowledge can also result in the disposal <b>of</b> perfectly suitable <b>backfill</b> material. A pipeline can be lifted up from the bottom <b>of</b> the <b>trench</b> if the weight of the pipeline is lower than the weight <b>of</b> the liquefied <b>backfill.</b> Pipeline floatation occurs if a soil-water mixture remains liquefied over a too large distance. In general, coarse granular soils remain liquefied for only a short period of time. If the <b>backfill</b> is composed <b>of</b> fine material, it will take a relatively long period of time before the soil settles and develops structural density. G. C. Sills (1998) defines structural density as the density which marks the change from a fluid-supported suspension to a soil in which effective stresses exist. The subject of this study is prevention of pipeline floatation during dredge-based backfilling. It is therefore necessary to understand which characteristics cause pipeline floatation. Due to economic reasons, pipelines have become lighter than a typical soil-water mixture. This is a potential risk if the sedimentation time of a soil-water mixture is relatively long. Sedimentation time is the time required for soil particles to settle out of suspension. The sedimentation time and the backfilling process are analysed using the two dimensional (horizontal and vertical) sedimentation model (2 DV model) developed by Van Rhee. The 2 DV model is designed to simulate the sedimentation process inside a TSHD. However, in this thesis the model is used to simulate the <b>backfilling</b> <b>of</b> an offshore <b>trench.</b> To simulate this process correctly, it is necessary to implement a moving discharge point in the model. Loads due to waves and currents are not considered, since pipelines are usually installed during relatively calm weather. These considerations make it possible to use the 2 DV model. The backfilling process is studied in three steps. First, the process is simulated as a one-dimensional sedimentation test. Secondly, the <b>backfilling</b> <b>of</b> a <b>trench</b> using a stationary TSHD is evaluated. Finally, the <b>backfilling</b> <b>of</b> a <b>trench</b> using a moving TSHD is simulated. The moving TSHD tests produce a distribution of the soil-water mixture density. This distribution is converted to a grid which is used as input for the beam-model (Matlab). The beam-model simulates pipeline displacement at a certain moment during the backfilling operation. The beam-model is based on the theory of the beam on elastic foundation. In this model only static loads are considered; the own weight of the pipeline and the buoyant force caused by the displaced fluid. The beam-model combined with the 2 DV model provides an approach to model pipeline displacement during dredge-based backfilling. The 2 DV sedimentation model is tested to its limits in this thesis. The simulation <b>of</b> the <b>backfilling</b> operation <b>of</b> a moving hopper requires a model area with a great length and a relatively small height. This results in a model composed of stretched grid cells (in longitudinal direction). The 2 DV model is at his numerical boundaries due to these stretched grid cells. The results of the ‘moving hopper’ simulations are therefore questionable. The results of the static simulations can be considered as reliable, since in these simulations the 2 DV model remains well within the boundaries.

40|$|A {{finite element}} {{analysis}} was used to examine the lateral soil deformation behavior of soft soils during the construction of levee improvements along the Sacramento River East Levee (SREL) in the Natomas Basin just north of Sacramento, CA. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, it was found that Sacramento had the greatest risk of flooding due the ageing and inadequately maintained levee systems. An executive order was declared and agencies began to evaluate and mitigate levee conditions. Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency (SAFCA) evaluated the levee conditions and then designed and executed levee improvements along a 10 mile stretch of the SREL from 2005 - 2011. To meet United States Army Corps of Engineers Standards, a new adjacent levee was required. For underseepage control for much of this length, a soil-bentonite cutoff wall (SB wall) under the future adjacent levee crest was to be excavated near the toe of the existing 2 H: 1 V embankment. Prior to construction, inclinometers were installed at the adjacent levee toe and between the existing levee and slurry trench. Inclinometer data showed unexpected horizontal movements of up to 10 mm, away from the trench during the excavation under a bentonite-slurry mixture. After the soil-bentonite fill was placed, horizontal movements shifted towards the trench and greater than 25 mm of movement were observed to distances nearly two times the slurry trench depth from the cutoff wall alignment. A study was developed to evaluate the key parameters affecting lateral deformation of the soft Sacramento River soils. The model was implemented in multiple steps to mimic the actual phased construction performed in the field. The steps included the initial working platform fill, excavation and subsequent filling <b>of</b> the <b>trench</b> with bentonite-slurry mixture, <b>backfilling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trench</b> and final filling of the embankment. Soil and ground conditions in the model were established from field and laboratory testing. Developing accurate stress-strain response was crucial to understanding the key parameters attributing to the lateral movement in the field. Results obtained in the model were compared with recorded field measurements determined from inclinometer readings. The initial movement away from the trench was likely dependent on stiffness of the natural deposits. The amount and rate of lateral movement toward the trench, after backfilling, trended with horizontal consolidation <b>of</b> the soil-bentonite <b>backfill.</b> This study can be useful in understanding the lateral behavior of the soft soils for making lateral deformation predictions in the case of construction excavations...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is {{to aid in the}} {{development}} of vertical cutting mining as a mining method. In order to do so, the technical feasibility and viability, and environmental benefit of vertical cutting as a complementary mining method were investigated. The investigation was performed for the case of the Victor Diamond mine in northern Ontario, Canada, where open pit mining ends by the end of 2018 or beginning of 2019. Vertical cutting has been used for several decades for the construction of water retention walls in the civil engineering industry. By placing the vertical cutter system directly on top of an ore target and cutting straight, vertical trenches up to a maximum depth of 150 m, it is intended to cross over to the mining industry. Extraction with vertical cutting can occur according four extraction scenarios. Three of the scenarios are land-based, the fourth assumes flooding of the mine, and has not been considered for the Victor project. Checkerboard mining is the base case extraction scenario with an extraction rate of approximately 30 %. The long trenching scenario would increase the recovery with an additional 15 % but induces a high risk of instability in the existing pit walls and the kimberlite in between the <b>trenches.</b> Application <b>of</b> <b>backfill</b> is the third scenario and achieves a recovery <b>of</b> 98 %. <b>Backfilling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trenches</b> requires the movement of significant volumes of additional rock as well as induces time delays due to the curing time <b>of</b> the <b>backfill.</b> Financial evaluation <b>of</b> the vertical cutting scenarios shows a high dependency of the project value on a decreasing cutting performance. Cumulative cash flow analysis and NPV suggest that extending the mine life at the Victor Diamond mine with vertical cutting is favourable. Even in the case of increased rock strengths, as expected in the deeper parts of the Victor pipes, vertical cutting has a positive net present project value. Long trenching, which is considered to be of high risk for pit stability has only marginally greater project value than the base case. The development of alternative mining solutions also aims to reduce the impact of the mining operations on the surrounding environment. Vertical cutting combines multiple mining processes into one operating piece of equipment. It reduces the GHG emissions, improves the safety of extraction process and is expected to increase the support from stakeholders. Extending operational life using conventional methods would require large expansion of the mine involving the increase of the operational fleet, pumping capacity and land usage. The application of vertical cutting has the ability to prevent the negative impact of enlarged open pit mining while maintaining the benefit of continued production...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} was to provide comprehensive life cycle inventories for the construction and renovation of sewers. A detailed inventory was provided with multiple options of pipe materials, diameters and site-specific characteristics, and was embedded into the Excel ® -based tool SewerLCA. The tool allows for life cycle evaluation of different sewers. It was applied to determine the most important phases, processes, and related parameters involved in the construction and renovation of sewers from an environmental and economical perspective. Methods: Comprehensive life cycle inventories (LCIs) for sewers construction and renovation were obtained by first identifying all processes involved after interviewing construction experts and reviewing sewer construction budgets from a Catalan company; and second transforming the processes into masses of materials and energy usage using construction databases. In order to run the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) the materials and energy typologies from the inventories were matched to their corresponding equivalents into available LCI databases. Afterwards the potential impacts were calculated {{through the use of}} LCIA characterization factors from ReCiPe. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was run several times to assess the construction of a 1 -km-long sewer with varying pipe materials, life spans for each material, diameters, transport distances, site-specific characteristics, and pipe deposition options. Results and discussion: The environmental impacts generated by construction and renovation of a 1 km Polyvinylchloride (PVC) pipe with a diameter of 40 cm are mainly associated with pipe laying and <b>backfilling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trench.</b> The evaluation <b>of</b> several pipe materials and diameters shows that the exclusion of renovation would underestimate the impacts by 38 to 82 % depending on the pipe materials and diameters. Including end-of-life phase for plastic pipe materials increases climate change (up to an extra 71 %) and human toxicity (up to an extra 147 %) impacts (among all diameters). The preferred pipe materials from an environmental point of view are precast concrete and High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE). Site-specific characteristics (specially the presence of rocky soil and asphalt placement) and material life span have a high influence on the overall environmental profile, whereas changes in transport distances have only a minor impact (< 4 %). Conclusions: Environmental impacts during the construction and renovation of sewers are subject to differences in material type, site-specific characteristics and material life span. Renovation of sewers has a large influence on all potential environmental impacts and costs and, hence, should not be omitted in LCA studies. The treatment and disposal processes of plastic pipes {{at the end of their}} life has to be accounted in LCA studiesThe authors would like to thank Voltes S. L.
