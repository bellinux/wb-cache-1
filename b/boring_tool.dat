500|$|Borehole drilling: By {{at least}} the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD), the Chinese used deep {{borehole}} drilling for mining and other projects; The British sinologist and historian Michael Loewe states that borehole sites could reach as deep as 600m (2000ft). K.S. Tom describes the drilling process: [...] "The Chinese method of deep drilling was accomplished {{by a team of}} men jumping on and off a beam to impact the drilling bit while the <b>boring</b> <b>tool</b> was rotated by buffalo and oxen." [...] This was the same method used for extracting petroleum in California during the 1860s (i.e. [...] "Kicking Her Down"). A Western Han Dynasty bronze foundry discovered in Xinglong, Hebei had nearby mining shafts which reached depths of 100m (328ft) with spacious mining areas; the shafts and rooms were complete with a timber frame, ladders and iron tools. (For further information, see the entry on [...] "natural gas as fuel" [...] below.) ...|$|E
500|$|On Han tomb brick reliefs of Sichuan province, {{scenes of}} {{borehole}} drilling for mining projects are shown. They show towering derricks lifting liquid brine through bamboo pipes {{to the surface}} so that the brine could be distilled in evaporation pans over the heat of furnaces and produce salt. The furnaces were heated by natural gas brought by bamboo pipes, yet gas brought up from [...] below the surface could cause an explosion {{if it was not}} properly mixed with oxygen first, so the Han-era Chinese built underground carburetor chambers and siphoned some of the gas off with exhaust pipes. The drill bit for digging boreholes was operated by a team of men jumping on and off a beam while the <b>boring</b> <b>tool</b> was rotated by a draft animal, usually oxen or water buffaloes. Han boreholes dug for collecting brine could reach hundreds of meters (feet) beneath the Earth's surface. Mining shafts dating to the Han dynasty have been found which reach depths of hundreds of meters (feet) beneath the earth, complete with spacious underground rooms structured by timber frames along with ladders and iron tools left behind.|$|E

50|$|A {{boring bar}} {{is a tool}} used in {{metalworking}} and woodworking. Boring is a technique used in many aspects of building. Woodworkers have used boring {{as a form of}} drilling for centuries. In woodworking, the <b>boring</b> <b>tool</b> is static in size and used to form circular plunge cuts. In metalworking, boring is slightly different in that the hole that results need not be circular.

50|$|Pneumatic <b>bore</b> <b>tools</b> do have {{drawbacks}} {{which can}} cause difficulties completing the bore. First {{the distance of the}} <b>bore</b> the <b>tool</b> can create is limited by the length of the hose that supplies the tool with air. Also the tool is not steerable. Once it has exited the bore pit, the operator no longer has control over it. The tool can be deflected by rocks and soil density to a path the operator had not intended. If this deflection is {{in the direction of the}} surface, the tool can cause damage to the obstacle being bored under. If it is downward, the tool can dive to an unrecoverable depth. If it is deflected side to side the tool could also run into other utilities. These hazards make it important for the operator to maintain close observation of the tool.The type of ground the tool is working in can also lead to problems. If the soil is too loose, the tool cannot compact the soil, stalling it out or leaving no bore hole. If the soil is rocky the tool may be deflected or fail to pound forward due to its inability break the rock. These drawbacks can be overcome by directional boring.|$|R

Also, heat flow experiments in dentine showed that the CVD diamond burrs induce temperature gradients of the same order as the conventional ones.
