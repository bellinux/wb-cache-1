5|$|After the show, {{the song}} {{went on to}} chart in several European countries, {{reaching}} number one in Belgium, Iceland and the Netherlands, as well as reaching the top ten in several other countries. The group's self-titled début album, released in May 2014, was also a success in the Netherlands and in other countries. The success of The Common Linnets in the contest was met with wide praise, with many commenting that their triumph was a <b>boost</b> <b>to</b> the musicality and credibility of the contest.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{preceding}} naval engagements around Guadalcanal, the strategic outcome was inconclusive because neither the Japanese nor United States navies secured operational {{control of the}} waters around Guadalcanal {{as a result of}} this action. However, the Battle of Cape Esperance provided a significant morale <b>boost</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. Navy after the failure at the Savo Island.|$|E

5|$|From Russia, with Love was {{released}} in the UK as a hardback on 8 April 1957, by the publishers Jonathan Cape. The American edition was published {{a few weeks later}} by Macmillan. In November 1956 the Prime Minister, Sir Anthony Eden, had visited Fleming's Jamaican Goldeneye estate, to recuperate from a breakdown in his health. This was much reported in the British press, and the publication of From Russia, with Love was accompanied by a promotional campaign that capitalised on Fleming's raised public profile. The serialisation of the story in The Daily Express in 1957 provided a <b>boost</b> <b>to</b> the sales of the book; a bigger rise in sales was to follow four years later. In an article in Life on 17 March 1961, the US President John F. Kennedy listed From Russia, with Love as one of his ten favourite books. This accolade, and its associated publicity, led to a surge in sales that made Fleming the biggest-selling crime writer in the US. There was a further <b>boost</b> <b>to</b> sales following the release of the film of the same name in 1963, which saw the sales of the Pan paperback rise from 145,000 in 1962 to 642,000 in 1963 and 600,000 in 1964.|$|E
5|$|The American colonists {{met their}} goal of {{strengthening}} {{the siege of}} Boston by removing livestock and hay on those islands from {{the reach of the}} British regulars. The British armed schooner Diana was also destroyed and its weaponry was appropriated by the Colonial side. This was the first naval capture of the war, and it was a significant <b>boost</b> <b>to</b> the morale of the Colonial forces.|$|E

5|$|This result marked Manchester United's {{first defeat}} of 1999. It {{was the second}} {{consecutive}} year that Arsenal beat United to win the Charity Shield. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger described it as psychological <b>boost</b> <b>to</b> beat his opponents and felt the win showed that his team were ready for the upcoming season. United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, on the other hand, believed the defeat highlighted his players needed more game time.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the {{rationing}} {{of petroleum}} fuels gave a <b>boost</b> <b>to</b> ridership on the electric tramways. To handle the massive increase in ridership, the trams were equipped with two conductors. The single-centre-door solution that worked excellently {{before the war}} became a bottle-neck as the trams became packed with riders. Lack of parts, particularly for the British Vickers motors, caused long waits for defective vehicles at the depots. From 1942, the Kolsås Line was transferred to terminate at Nationaltheatret in the city centre, and the Class B was operated along the Lilleaker Line from the west. Trams 164–166 were sent to Düsseldorf in Germany, but were never used because the city lacked balloon loops and the trams were too wide.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, Queen Mary instituted an {{austerity}} {{drive at}} the palace, where she rationed food, and visited wounded and dying servicemen in hospital, which caused her great emotional strain. After {{three years of}} war against Germany, and with anti-German feeling in Britain running high, the Russian Imperial Family, which had been deposed by a revolutionary government, was refused asylum, possibly {{in part because the}} Tsar's wife was German-born. News of the Tsar's abdication provided a <b>boost</b> <b>to</b> those in Britain who wished to replace their own monarchy with a republic. The war ended in 1918 with the defeat of Germany and the abdication and exile of the Kaiser.|$|E

5|$|Madagascar {{has one of}} the world's largest {{reserves}} of ilmenite (titanium ore), as well as important {{reserves of}} chromite, coal, iron, cobalt, copper and nickel. Several major projects are underway in the mining, oil and gas sectors that are anticipated to give a significant <b>boost</b> <b>to</b> the Malagasy economy. These include such projects as ilmenite and zircon mining from heavy mineral sands near Tôlanaro by Rio Tinto, extraction of nickel near Moramanga and its processing near Toamasina by Sherritt International, and the development of the giant onshore heavy oil deposits at Tsimiroro and Bemolanga by Madagascar Oil.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Lost Light, {{attempting}} {{to track down}} Jhiaxus, is pulled off-course by a summons from the badly-wounded Metroplex, via a severed portion of his thumb the ship had previously encountered. Finding the ancient Autobot, and his companions Windblade, Chromia and Nautica on the ocean planet Hydrophena, the crew defends him and themselves against an army of Shockwave's Ammonite minions and use their ship's engines to give him enough of a power <b>boost</b> <b>to</b> teleport them all back home to Cybertron. They return as the Necrotitan {{is in the middle}} of razing Iacon at Shockwave's command; Megatron, having fallen in with Bumblebee, uses his space bridge to teleport Metroplex's thumb — revealed to contain another of Shockwave's ores — from the Lost Light back into its owner's hand, giving him the energy to defeat the Necrotitan and heal the plague.|$|E
5|$|Poor soil {{conditions}} and bad weather led to crop failures {{during the first}} three years of the project, but the group still managed to cultivate mint and farm livestock. The burgeoning timber industry provided a <b>boost</b> <b>to</b> the settlement's economy, and by 1918 there were over 500 families residing there. A fire in 1917 razed the entire village, leading to the departure of around twenty families. Ueshiba was attending a meeting over railway construction around 50 miles away, but on learning of the fire travelled back the entire distance on foot. He was elected to the village council that year, and took a prominent role in leading the reconstruction efforts. In the summer of 1918, Hatsu gave birth to their first son, Takemori.|$|E

5|$|Restoration work in 1984 cost £2,918. Grants {{received}} were £1,209 from English Heritage, £500 from St Edmundsbury Borough Council, Other donations {{amounted to}} £52. Income from open {{days at the}} mill came to £151. A <b>boost</b> <b>to</b> the funds was £2,000 from Hervey Benham. This money had been allocated to allow the moving of a derelict post mill buck to Thelnetham. In the end, the removal was not proceeded with, and Mr Benham allowed the donation to remain with the Thelnetham Mill Preservation Trust. The project received further support in local media, including the East Anglian Daily Times, one of the work-ins being featured on Anglia Television's About Anglia programme.|$|E
5|$|The next day, September 16, {{there was}} further {{fighting}} when {{a clash of}} outposts escalated into a running battle below Washington's lines on Harlem Heights. After several hours exchange of musketry, the forces engaged returned to their start lines, and {{the position of the}} two armies on Manhattan remained relatively unchanged for the next two months. Having held their own against picked British troops, the American army received a much needed <b>boost</b> <b>to</b> their morale after the debâcle of the previous day, while the British acquired a renewed respect for the American ability to stand and fight.|$|E
5|$|Vocally, {{the support}} from Stockport fans {{has often been}} cited by {{managers}} and players as inspirational and a huge <b>boost</b> <b>to</b> the team during play, with their influence likened to having a twelfth player on the field. Stockport supporters often receive praise from other players and managers, {{both at home and}} away, for their vocal support. Between the 2006–07 and 2009–10 seasons the squad number 12 was allocated to the 'Blue & White Army', in reference to the supporters being the team's 12th man on matchdays. However, for the 2010–11 season, the number reverted to one of the players.|$|E

5|$|Washington at {{this time}} moved his {{headquarters}} from Middlebrook in New Jersey up to New Windsor on the Hudson, with an army of 10,000. The British, led by Clinton, made a move up the Hudson against American posts at Verplanck's Point and Stony Point, and both places succumbed; but a counter-offensive was briefly successful by the patriots led by General Anthony Wayne. Clinton was able to shut off Kings Ferry in the end, {{but it was a}} strategic loss; he could proceed no farther up the river due to American fortifications and Washington's army. The skirmishes at Verplanck's Point and at Stony Point demonstrated that the continental infantry had become quite formidable and were an enormous <b>boost</b> <b>to</b> morale.|$|E
5|$|When the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, the American ice trade {{received}} a temporary <b>boost</b> <b>to</b> production. Shipments of chilled food to Europe surged during the war, placing significant {{demands on the}} country's existing refrigeration capabilities, while the need to produce munitions for the war effort meant that ammonia and coal for refrigeration plants were in short supply. The U.S. government worked together with the plant and natural ice industries to promote the use of natural ice to relieve the burden and maintain adequate supplies. For Britain and Norway, however, the war impacted badly on the natural ice trade; the German attempt to blockade the North Sea with U-boats made shipments difficult and Britain relied increasingly more heavily on its limited number of ice plants for supplies instead.|$|E
5|$|After {{the home}} {{was placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1974 (the result of an {{application}} by an Eldon farmer), the owner refurbished the house, installing an indoor bathroom and electricity and restoring the windows and wallpaper. Local politicians believed such work coupled with a new museum and education center could provide a major <b>boost</b> <b>to</b> local tourism—one state senator hoped for as many as 100,000 visitors per year. After the house's owner eventually turned over the property to the State Historical Society of Iowa in 1991, an effort was made to move the house to Living History Farms outside Des Moines, but Eldonians fought to keep it within their city limits. The house was renovated in 1992, with boosters hoping to see the house become a pop-culture tourism attraction, much like the Field of Dreams site in similarly rural Dyersville. Today the American Gothic House Center hosts approximately 15,000 visitors per year, which does not account for additional after-hours visitors.|$|E
