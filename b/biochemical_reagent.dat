This paper demonstrates experimentally, and analyzes theoretically, the use of multiple laminar fluid streams in microfluidic channels to deliver reagents to, and remove them from, cells with subcellular spatial selectivity. The technique made it possible to label different subpopulations of mitochondria fluorescently, to disrupt selected regions of the cytoskeleton chemically, to dislodge limited areas of cell-substrate adhesions enzymatically, and to observe microcompartmental endocytosis within individual cells. This technique does not require microinjection or immobilization of reagents onto nondiffusive objects; it opens a new window into cell biology...|$|E

Modifying the band structure of strained-Si metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors by applying the in-plane tensile strain reportedly improves electron and hole mobility. The oxidation-induced Ge condensation increases the Ge fraction in a SiGe-on-insulator (SGOI) and substantially increases hole mobility. However, oxidation increases the number of surface states, resulting in hole mobility degradation. In this work, 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) {{was used as a}} <b>biochemical</b> <b>reagent.</b> The hydroxyl molecule on the oxide surface was replaced by the methoxy groups of the APTMS molecule. We proposed a surface plasma treatment to improve the electrical properties of SiGe nanowires. Fluorine plasma treatment can result in enhanced rates of thermal oxidation and speed up the formation of a self-passivation oxide layer. Like a capping oxide layer, the self-passivation oxide layer reduces the rate of follow-up oxidation. Preoxidation treatment also improved the sensitivity of SiGe nanowires because the Si-F binding was held at a more stable interface state compared to bare nanowire on the SiGe surface. Additionally, the sensitivity can be further improved by either the N 2 plasma posttreatment or the low-temperature postannealing due to the suppression of outdiffusion of Ge and F atoms from the SiGe nanowire surface...|$|E

40|$|Rhodotorula glutinis is a {{convenient}} source of L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, an enzyme that is {{useful as a}} <b>biochemical</b> <b>reagent</b> in the assay of L-phenylalanine. There have been previous descriptions of induced lyase production in complex medium where induction occurs late in exponential growth, suggesting a role in secondary metabolism such {{as is the case}} in higher plants. A higher specific activity of L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (sixfold higher than a complex medium) can be obtained during midexponential growth in a defined medium containing L-phenylalanine as the sole source of carbon. L-Phenylalanine will also induce lyase synthesis during exponential growth in minimal in which L-phenylalanine is the sole source of nitrogen. The appearance of lyase in complex medium supplemented with L-phenylalanine is probably triggered fortuitously by exhaustion late in growth of a prime source of nitrogen. In this study, R. glutinis appeared to express a single lyase enzyme, regardless of whether induction was nitrogen signaled or carbon signaled. Thin-layer chromatographic analysis of ether extracts prepared from cultures induced with doubly labeled (U- 14 C; ring- 4 - 3 H) L-phenylalanine provided evidence of a catabolic sequence containing cinnamic acid, benzoic acid, and 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid as degradative intermediates. 3, 4 -Dihydroxybenzoic acid was not identified as a catabolic intermediate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Chikungunya Virus (ChikV) {{surprised}} {{by a massive}} re-emerging outbreak in Indian Ocean in 2006, reaching Europe in 2007 and exhibited exceptional severe physiopathology in infants and elderly patients. In this context, {{it is important to}} analyze the innate immune host responses triggered against ChikV. Autophagy {{has been shown to be}} an important component of the innate immune response and is involved in host defense elimination of different pathogens. However, the autophagic process was recently observed to be hijacked by virus for their own replication. Here we provide the first evidence that hallmarks of autophagy are specifically found in HEK. 293 infected cells and are involved in ChikV replication. Methods To test the capacity of ChikV to mobilize the autophagic machinery, we performed fluorescence microscopy experiments on HEK. GFP. LC 3 stable cells, and followed the LC 3 distribution during the time course of ChikV infection. To confirm this, we performed electron microscopy on HEK. 293 infected cells. To test the effect of ChikV-induced-autophagy on viral replication, we blocked the autophagic process, either by pharmacological (3 -MA) or genetic inhibition (siRNA against the transcript of Beclin 1, an autophagic protein), and analyzed the percentage of infected cells and the viral RNA load released in the supernatant. Moreover, the effect of induction of autophagy by Rapamycin on viral replication was tested. Results The increasing number of GFP-LC 3 positive cells with a punctate staining together with the enhanced number of GFP-LC 3 dots per cell showed that ChikV triggered an autophagic process in HEK. 293 infected cells. Those results were confirmed by electron microscopy analysis since numerous membrane-bound vacuoles characteristic of autophagosomes were observed in infected cells. Moreover, we found that inhibition of autophagy, either by <b>biochemical</b> <b>reagent</b> and RNA interference, dramatically decreases ChikV replication. Conclusions Taken together, our results suggest that autophagy may play a promoting role in ChikV replication. Investigating in details the relationship between autophagy and viral replication will greatly improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of ChikV and provide insight for the design of candidate antiviral therapeutics. </p...|$|E

LISPDE activity selectively degraded Sp 1, but not nuclear protein, C-fos, p 65, I-κBα and protein actin. Nuclear extract contains approximately 14 -fold of the LISPDE activity as that detected in cytoplasmic extract, suggesting that LISPDE is predominantly a nuclear protease. Using <b>biochemical</b> <b>reagents,</b> protease inhibitors and peptide substrates, we have characterized the LISPDE activity.

40|$|Cell {{adhesion}} to extracellular matrices (ECM) {{is essential}} to numerous physiological and pathological processes. Cell adhesion is initiated by binding of the transmembrane integrin family of receptors to an ECM ligand such as fibronectin (FN). Once bound, integrins cluster together and form focal adhesions (FA). FAs serve as structural links and signal transduction elements between the cell and its extracellular environment. While {{a great deal of}} {{progress has been made in}} identifying the biochemical components that comprise focal adhesions and the roles they play in migration, cell spreading, and signaling, the contributions of these proteins to mechanical interactions between the cell and its environment remain poorly understood. 	A FA adhesion protein of particular importance is vinculin. When localized to focal adhesions, vinculin forms a ternary complex with talin and  1 -integrin. This  1 -integrin-talin-vinculin complex plays a central role in the regulation of FA assembly and cell spreading and migration. Nevertheless, the specific contribution to adhesive force generation of the  1 -integrin-talin-vinculin complex remains poorly understood. 	The objective of this project was to analyze the role of vinculin in the cell adhesion strengthening process.

The overall prevalence of MS found in the sample following the NCEP and IDF criteria was 55. 8 % and 60. 8 %, respectively. No associations were found between gender and diagnostic criteria. Individuals with high+moderate FRS had a higher risk of developing MS compared to those with low FRS. Logistic regression analysis showed an independent association of abdominal adiposity by the IDF criteria (OR 4. 8, CI 1. 0 - 22. 1; p = 0. 04) and glycemia by NCEP criteria (OR 3. 0, CI 1. 1 - 8. 4; p = 0. 03) with moderate+high FRS. The prevalence of MS was high under both criteria, being more predominant in those patients with moderate+high FRS. Thus, the components of MS abdominal adiposity and glucose levels were associated with increased CRF, indicating that the control of these factors can be decisive in reducing cardiovascular risk in the elderly...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of molecular systems that show reversible {{changes in their}} structures and functions is an active area of research as it has potential applications in molecular devices. One {{of the most promising}} photoresponsive frameworks is found in the 1, 2 -dithienylethenes (DTEs) because they can be toggled between two thermally stable and structurally unique forms when irradiated with the appropriate wavelengths of light and provide a practical means to regulate the chemical and physical properties of molecular devices. However, {{there are only a few}} examples that take advantage of these reversible structural and electronic differences between the two forms of DTE derivatives to influence chemical reactivity. The DTE backbone is well-suited to modulate chemical reactivity since the electronic differences between the ring-open and the ring-closed isomers can be used as the “on” and “off” functions to start and stop reactions using light as the external stimulus and has potential applications in the design of light-activated <b>reagents,</b> catalysts, and <b>biochemical</b> <b>reagents.</b> The research presented in this thesis focuses on integrating photoswitching and nucleophilicity using a pyridine-functionalized DTE to demonstrate the concept of photomodulating reactivity and catalysis. The first approach uses axial coordination to a metalloporphyrin as a probe to assess the differences in Lewis basicity between the two DTEs. The results show that the ring-open isomer is more effective as a ligand than the ring-closed form. This difference in coordination ability indicates that the pyridine is less Lewis basic in the ring-closed form of the DTE system. The second approach consists of evaluating this concept in chemical synthesis using pseudo-first-order kinetics to probe the differences in the apparent rates of alkylation between the two DTE isomers. The results show that the ring-open form reacts faster than the ring-closed form indicating that the pyridine is less nucleophilic in the ring-closed form of the DTE system. The application of the DTE system as a potential nucleophilic catalyst is also investigated and the results show that the ring-open isomer gives a higher yield of product than the ring-closed isomer indicating that the ring-open isomer is acting as the more efficient catalyst for the reaction...|$|R

40|$|Correlating gene {{expression}} with cell behavior is ideally {{done at the}} single-cell level. However, this is not easily achieved because {{the small amount of}} labile mRNA present in a single cell (1 - 5 % of 1 - 50 pg total RNA, or 0. 01 - 2. 5 pg mRNA, per cell) mostly degrades before it can be reverse transcribed into a stable cDNA copy. For example, using standard laboratory reagents and hardware, {{only a small number of}} genes can be qualitatively assessed per cell. One way to increase the efficiency of standard laboratory reverse transcriptase (RT) reactions (i. e. standard reagents in microliter volumes) comprising single-cell amounts of mRNA would be to more rapidly mix the reagents so the mRNA can be converted to cDNA before it degrades. However this is not trivial because at microliter scales liquid flow is laminar, i. e. currently available methods of mixing (i. e. shaking, vortexing and trituration) fail to produce sufficient chaotic motion to effectively mix reagents. To solve this problem, micro-scale mixing techniques have to be used. A number of microfluidic-based mixing technologies have been developed which successfully increase RT reaction yields. However, microfluidics technologies require specialized hardware that is relatively expensive and not yet widely available. A cheaper, more convenient solution is desirable. The main objective of this study is to demonstrate how application of a novel 'micromixing' technique to standard laboratory RT reactions comprising single-cell quantities of mRNA significantly increases their cDNA yields. We find cDNA yields increase by approximately 10 - 100 -fold, which enables: (1) greater numbers of genes to be analyzed per cell; (2) more quantitative analysis of {{gene expression}}; and (3) better detection of low-abundance genes in single cells. The micromixing is based on acoustic microstreaming, a phenomenon where sound waves propagating around a small obstacle create a mean flow near the obstacle. We have developed an acoustic microstreaming-based device ('micromixer') with a key simplification; acoustic microstreaming can be achieved at audio frequencies by ensuring the system has a liquid-air interface with a small radius of curvature. The meniscus of a microliter volume of solution in a tube provides an appropriately small radius of curvature. The use of audio frequencies means that the hardware can be inexpensive and versatile, and nucleic acids and other <b>biochemical</b> <b>reagents</b> are not damaged like they can be with standard laboratory sonicators...|$|R
