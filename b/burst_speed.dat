40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple method for calculation of <b>burst</b> <b>speeds</b> of Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus) and short nose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) based on field observations of leaping sturgeon {{in the waters}} of the Kennebec and Androscoggin Rivers in Maine, USA. The applied method for calculation of <b>burst</b> <b>speeds</b> is based on equivalence of kinetic and potential energy and results in calculated <b>burst</b> <b>speeds</b> expressed in body-lengths-per-second (BLS) that exceed published swimming speeds for other sturgeon. The applied method has been discussed with fish passage professionals, including biologists and engineers, and while the applied method may be described as reasonably sound, the results must be considered with due caution when considering their application to evaluation of the potential for sturgeon to successfully negotiate fish passage systems. The intent of this talk is to present and dissect the applied method and to emphasize the potential deficiencies of deterministic analyses and evaluation of species-specific swimming speeds...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{extension}} of a paper by Weiss and Prager in which these authors have applied Tresca 2 ̆ 7 s yield condition and the associated flow rule to the determination of the <b>bursting</b> <b>speed</b> of a rotating annular disc, having constant initial thickness. In this thesis the results of the paper are extended directly to the problem of the axially-symmetric annular disc with an arbitrary initial thickness. It is found that Tresca 2 ̆ 7 s yield condition and the associated flow rule {{do not appear to be}} applicable to the problem of the solid disc;Von Mises 2 ̆ 7 yield condition is next applied to the problem of the axially-symmetric disc with an arbitrary initial thickness. Under the assumption that the elastic strains are negligible in comparison with the plastic strains, the Von Mises 2 ̆ 7 stress-strain rate law is used, rather than the more complex Prandtl-Reuss stress-strain Law; A set of simultaneous equations is obtained, whose solution is the set of stresses and strains corresponding to the considered angular velocity of the disc. <b>Bursting</b> <b>speed</b> of the disc is assumed to be that value of angular speed for which the strains may increase indefinitely without further increase in rotational speed. In general, this system of equations must be solved numerically, a process which may be carried out with the aid of a desk calculator;The <b>bursting</b> <b>speed</b> of a solid disc having a constant initial thickness is computed, using Von Mises 2 ̆ 7 yield condition, and the results compared with the <b>bursting</b> <b>speed</b> of an annular disc obtained by the use of Tresca 2 ̆ 7 s yield condition.

50|$|The {{successor}} of Sony Alpha 77 model, the Sony Alpha 77 II {{is similar}} in design to its antecedent, {{including the use of}} a SLT transparent mirror and electronic viewfinder.

The focus area is wider and denser, with a class-leading 79 AF points including 15 crossing sensor combined with subject tracking and eye-focus capabilities. The SLT design avoids the need to flip the mirror out of the way with every shot, allowing a rapid 12 fps <b>burst</b> <b>speed</b> for up to 60 frames in full resolution. Unlike most DSLR cameras, the phase-detect focus unit is operational during live-view and video (which is Full HD at 60p/50p and 24p/25p). The resolution of the camera is 24 megapixels.

5000|$|The {{class was}} also criticised for being overcrowded - at 384 ft (117 m), they had 177 crewmen {{compared}} to 436 ft (133 m) and just 185 crewmen {{for the modern}} Type 23 frigate. This was important {{at a time when}} the Royal Navy was facing a manpower shortage. The standard of accommodation for the officers was better than the RN average and the senior ratings enjoyed separate cabins - unlike the petty officers of the Type 42 destroyer of the same era, who slept in bunk rooms. The ratings' accommodation was also improved, with four-man sleeping berths leading off from the communal mess deck; again, far better than those of the Type 42 destroyer. In essence, the standard of accommodation and fitting were better, especially for officers, because it was a design intended to attract export orders. It is very little more than a stretched version of the MK 7 Vospers frigate built for third world Libya and, other than the fitting of CAAIS, with its electronic and intended weapon fit essentially the same as the Mk 7 prototype in type or level of sophistication. Higher automation and the new Mk 8 4.5 inch automatic gun combined with, in many ways, a much simpler electronic fit than the Leanders or Type 42, the new Type 21 class lacked both the long range radar, the Type 965, carried by most UK warships or the Limbo mortar and it associated sonar. Inevitably, that meant a much smaller crew than the Leanders, with little capability to modernise (owing to its small size) and already being close to its topweight limit; the Type 21's days were numbered. A decision not to modernize them was made in 1979 [...] even before the Falklands losses. The several hundred tons of ballast that had to be carried low down meant that the frigates could not usually achieve their planned 35 knots speed for any long distance, but the ships were all still good for a dramatic 37 knot <b>burst</b> <b>speed,</b> with two ships claiming to have exceeded 40 knots on more than one occasion. Nevertheless, these ships were regarded favorably by their crews and proved to be highly maneuverable and reliable assets in a navy suffering depletion in the number of modern escort hulls.|$|E

40|$|The {{computation}} of {{the burst}} of turbine disks for aeronautical engines is a current problem of great practical interest. Turbine disks are stressed by severe loads, {{for this reason}} {{the knowledge of the}} burst angular velocity is of primary importance for the whole safety of the aircraft during ordinary missions or extra-ordinary conditions that engines may encounter during service. In this work, a numerical method to predict the <b>burst</b> <b>speed</b> is presented, introducing the physical phenomenon {{at the base of the}} burst: the inertial instability. The method is based on Finite Element simulations taking into account the spin-softening effect which leads to instability and therefore to the burst of the disk. Two analytical solutions of rotating structures are used for a preliminary validation of the numerical results that simulate the inertial instability: in both cases the calculated <b>burst</b> <b>speed</b> agrees with the analytical results. The correlation between the non linear stress-strain curve and the inertial instability is then addressed by means of simulations that are performed in the end on areal disk subjected to typical loads acting on it. In conclusion, a comparison between the semi-empirical method of Robinson [14], which is at the base of standard disks certifications, and the FE approach is presented in terms of <b>burst</b> <b>speed</b> predictions show that FE calculation is more accurate to predict the limit spee...|$|E
