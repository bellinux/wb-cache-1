5|$|For the Coalition, the Russians were secure on {{the north}} bank of the Danube, {{awaiting}} reinforcements from Galicia; the bridges between Linz and Vienna had been destroyed, making French access to the Austrian capital more difficult, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible.</b> After six months of fighting in which the Austrians had enjoyed little good news, the Coalition could claim a difficult and timely victory. The French had retreated from the field with a badly mauled division and Kutuzov had secured the right flank. Indeed, Francis was so pleased with the outcome at Dürenstein that he awarded Kutuzov the Military Order of Maria Theresa.|$|E

25|$|Randomization of {{the virtual}} memory {{addresses}} at which functions and variables can be found can make exploitation of a buffer overflow more difficult, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible.</b> It also forces the attacker to tailor the exploitation attempt to the individual system, which foils the attempts of internet worms.

2500|$|Global commons {{is a term}} {{typically}} used to describe international, supranational, and global resource domains in which common-pool resources are found. [...] In economics, common goods are rivalrous and non-excludable, constituting {{one of the four}} main types of goods. A common-pool resource, also called a common property resource, is a special case of a common good (or public good) whose size or characteristics makes it costly, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible,</b> to exclude potential users. [...] Examples include both natural or human-made resource domains (e.g., a [...] "fishing hole" [...] or an irrigation system). Unlike global public goods, global common-pool resources face problems of congestion, overuse, or degradation because they are subtractable (which makes them rivalrous).|$|E

However, patients have been known to continue to improve for years, regaining and strengthening abilities like writing, walking, running, and talking.

2500|$|It is {{difficult}} <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible</b> to design rigorous research trials for acupuncture. Due to acupuncture's invasive nature, {{one of the}} major challenges in efficacy research is in the design of an appropriate placebo control group. For efficacy studies to determine whether acupuncture has specific effects, [...] "sham" [...] forms of acupuncture where the patient, practitioner, and analyst are blinded seem the most acceptable approach. [...] Sham acupuncture uses non-penetrating needles or needling at non-acupuncture points, e.g. inserting needles on meridians not related to the specific condition being studied, or in places not associated with meridians. [...] The under-performance of acupuncture in such trials may indicate that therapeutic effects are due entirely to non-specific effects, or that the sham treatments are not inert, or that systematic protocols yield less than optimal treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Bahir (בהיר) ("Illumination"), {{also known}} as Midrash of Rabbi Nehunya ben Ha-Kana - a book of special {{interest}} to students of Kabbalah because {{it serves as a}} kind of epitome that surveys the essential concepts of the subsequent literature of Kabbalah. It is about 12,000 words (about the size of a magazine). Despite its name [...] "Illumination", it is notoriously cryptic and difficult to understand (<b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible).</b> Much of it is written in parables, one after the other. The Bahir opens with a quote attributed to Rabbi Nehunya ben Ha-Kana, a Talmudic sage of the 1st century, and the rest the book is an unfolding discussion about the quote. Jewish tradition considers the whole book to be written in the spirit of Rabbi Nehunya (or even literally written by him). It was first published in Provence France (near Italy) in 1176. Historians suspect Rabbi Yitzhak Ha-Ivver (Isaac the Blind) wrote the book at this time, albeit he incorporated oral traditions from a much earlier time about the Tanakh, Talmud, Siddur, Yetzira, and other Rabbinic texts.|$|E
2500|$|From Welco Corners in Bolingbrook to Indian Head Park, I-55 {{was built}} on top of much of old US66. [...] Here, Route66 passed through what is now Woodridge, Darien, Willowbrook and Burr Ridge—none of which were in {{existence}} in 1926 when the route was created and did not come into existence as suburbs until the late 1950s through late 1960s. [...] The stretch from Darien northeast through what is now Countryside and Hodgkins was then {{part of a large}} rural farmland collectively known as Lyonsville, as the eastern end of it was located in Lyons Township in Cook County. This section of mainline I-55 is today signed as Historic US66, though inconsistently so, making it difficult for travelers to follow along the original 1926 path; however, a section of the original highway that now serves as the two-way north frontage road in Darien, Willowbrook and Burr Ridge retains the old Route66 feel. [...] The original path is slightly difficult to follow here, due to swings north around the I-55 interchanges between Lemont Road and County Line Road, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible,</b> and taking the north frontage road leads travelers past several sites of historic interest, including Cass Cemetery and the former Martin B. Madden mansion known as Castle Eden (now a Carmelite priory) in Darien as well as the International Harvester experimental fields in Burr Ridge (once known as Harvester, Illinois after the plant located there).|$|E

2500|$|From {{a musical}} {{perspective}} of reviewers, the {{limited range of}} Green Day compared to the Beatles creates a much less diverse experience compared to the previous game, diminishing the interest level for those not familiar with Green Day's music. [...] Many stated that one's personal enjoyment of the game would strictly depend on their preference for Green Day. While the inclusion of full albums was well received, some reviewers wished for more songs {{to be included in}} the game, particularly from their mid-career albums. Minkley considered that by skipping over these albums, [...] "the experience is robbed of any real insight into Green Day's evolution" [...] between Dookie and American Idiot. However, despite the song selections, reviewers found Green Day's songs to be better suited to Rock Band than The Beatles', in part to how enjoyable it was to play all the songs regardless of the instrument used, and without having to chart atypical instruments, such as piano or cello, to the instrument parts. Reviewers found the guitar portions to be challenging <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible</b> due to the endurance of the chord-heavy part. DeVries found the vocal harmonies mechanics to be better suited to Green Day, as with the lyrical trade-offs in many of the songs, [...] "it's less about trying to sing at a slightly higher pitch and more about just having fun". Critics also commented the use of censored radio edits to maintain the game's Teen rating, and felt this weakened the music included in the game. The ability to export the game's songs to other Rock Band was well received. However, Lou Kesten of the Associated Press noted that the added cost to export the game, as well as the cost of the additional six tracks available as downloadable content, made it feel that [...] "MTV is nickel-and-diming its loyal audience".|$|E
