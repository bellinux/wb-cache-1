5|$|Darwin's {{barnacle}} studies {{convinced him}} that variation arose constantly {{and not just in}} response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. He now realised that the <b>branching</b> <b>pattern</b> of evolutionary divergence was explained by natural selection working constantly to improve adaptation. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, {{influenced}} by the book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, already suspected that transmutation of species occurred when {{he began his career}} as a naturalist. By 1855, his biogeographical observations during his field work in South America and the Malay Archipelago made him confident enough in a <b>branching</b> <b>pattern</b> of evolution to publish a paper stating that every species originated in close proximity to an already existing closely allied species. Like Darwin, it was Wallace's consideration of how the ideas of Malthus might apply to animal populations that led him to conclusions very similar to those reached by Darwin about the role of natural selection. In February 1858, Wallace, unaware of Darwin's unpublished ideas, composed his thoughts into an essay and mailed them to Darwin, asking for his opinion. The result was the joint publication in July of an extract from Darwin's 1844 essay along with Wallace's letter. Darwin also began work on a short abstract summarising his theory, which he would publish in 1859 as On the Origin of Species.|$|E

Evidence from biogeography, especially from the biogeography of oceanic islands, {{played a key role in}} convincing both Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace that species evolved with a <b>branching</b> <b>pattern</b> of common descent. Islands often contain endemic species, species not found anywhere else, but those species are often related to species found on the nearest continent. Furthermore, islands often contain clusters of closely related species that have very different ecological niches, that is have different ways of making a living in the environment. Such clusters form through a process of adaptive radiation where a single ancestral species colonises an island that has a variety of open ecological niches and then diversifies by evolving into different species adapted to fill those empty niches. Well-studied examples include Darwin's finches, a group of 13 finch species endemic to the Galápagos Islands, and the Hawaiian honeycreepers, a group of birds that once, before extinctions caused by humans, numbered 60 species filling diverse ecological roles, all descended from a single finch like ancestor that arrived on the Hawaiian Islands some 4 million years ago. Another example is the Silversword alliance, a group of perennial plant species, also endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, that inhabit a variety of habitats and come in a variety of shapes and sizes that include trees, shrubs, and ground hugging mats, but which can be hybridised with one another and with certain tarweed species found on the west coast of North America; it appears that one of those tarweeds colonised Hawaii in the past, and gave rise to the entire Silversword alliance.|$|E

[...] Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a <b>branching</b> <b>pattern</b> of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.|$|E
500|$|Evolutionary ideas came to {{prominence}} in the early 19th century with {{the theory of the}} transmutation of species put forward by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. [...] Evolution was at first opposed on both scientific, notably by Georges Cuvier, and religious grounds. The idea that laws control nature and society gained vast popular audiences with George Combe's The Constitution of Man of 1828 and the anonymous Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation of 1844. When Charles Darwin published his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, he convinced most of the scientific community that new species arise through descent through modification in a <b>branching</b> <b>pattern</b> of divergence from common ancestors, but while most scientists accepted that natural selection is a valid and empirically testable hypothesis, Darwin's view that it is the primary mechanism of evolution was generally rejected, in favour of alternative mechanisms.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} written for non-specialist readers and {{attracted}} widespread interest upon its publication. As Darwin was an eminent scientist, his findings were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific, philosophical, and religious discussion. The debate over the book contributed to the campaign by T.H. Huxley and his fellow members of the X Club to secularise science by promoting scientific naturalism. Within two decades there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution, with a <b>branching</b> <b>pattern</b> of common descent, had occurred, but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that Darwin thought appropriate. During [...] "the eclipse of Darwinism" [...] from the 1880s to the 1930s, various other mechanisms of evolution were given more credit. With {{the development of the}} modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s, Darwin's concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory, and it has now become the unifying concept of the life sciences.|$|E

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor ofPhilosophy of the University of BedfordshireSequential patterns mining is an important pattern discovery technique used to identify frequently observed sequential occurrence of items across ordered transactions over time. It has been intensively studied and there exists a great diversity of algorithms. However, {{there is a major}} problem associated with the conventional sequential patterns mining in that patterns derived are often large and not very easy to understand or use. In addition, more complex relations among events are often hidden behind sequences. A novel model for sequential patterns called Sequential Patterns Graph (SPG) is proposed. The construction algorithm of SPG is presented with experimental results to substantiate the concept. The thesis then sets out to define some new structural patterns such as concurrent <b>branch</b> <b>patterns,</b> exclusive patterns and iterative patterns which are generally hidden behind sequential patterns. Finally, an integrative framework, named Post Sequential Patterns Mining (PSPM), which is based on sequential patterns mining, is also proposed for the discovery and visualisation of structural patterns. This thesis is intended to prove that discrete sequential patterns derived from traditional sequential patterns mining can be modelled graphically using SPG. It is concluded from experiments and theoretical studies that SPG is not only a minimal representation of sequential patterns mining, but it also represents the interrelation among patterns and establishes further the foundation for mining structural knowledge (i. e. concurrent <b>branch</b> <b>patterns,</b> exclusive patterns and iterative patterns). from experiments conducted on both synthetic and real datasets, it is shown that Concurrent <b>Branch</b> <b>Patterns</b> (CBP) mining is an effective and efficient mining algorithm suitable for concurrent <b>branch</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R

500|$|Armillaria luteobubalina uses [...] "an elaborate, {{sophisticated}} aeration system" [...] {{that enables}} it to efficiently deliver oxygen into the rhizomorphs, helping it thrive in low-oxygen environments.

Rhizomorphs develop beneath clusters of so-called [...] "air-pores" [...] near the perforations. These gas spaces connect the atmosphere {{with the central}} canal of the rhizomorph, to facilitate diffusion of oxygen and satiate the organism's high oxygen requirement during growth.

The rhizomorphs have a dichotomous <b>branching</b> <b>pattern,</b> so that they split or bifurcate at various intervals. Experiments and field observations have shown that this allows the fungus to be a more aggressive and virulent pathogen than Armillaria species whose rhizomorphs branch monopodially (where lateral branches grow from a main stem).
