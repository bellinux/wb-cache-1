30|$|Second, we {{demonstrated}} that the torus canard explosions in these systems play central roles in the transitions between the spiking and <b>bursting</b> regimes. <b>In</b> the HR system, the torus canards occur precisely in the transition region from spiking to sub-Hopf/fold cycle <b>bursting,</b> <b>in</b> which the active phase of the burst initiates when the trajectory passes a subcritical Hopf bifurcation point and terminates when it passes the fold of limit cycles. The transitions from spiking to <b>bursting</b> <b>in</b> the MLT and WCI models are, respectively, to circle/fold cycle <b>bursting</b> <b>in</b> which the active phase initiates in a saddle-node bifurcation on an invariant circle (a.k.a. SNIC), and to fold/fold cycle <b>bursting</b> <b>in</b> which the active phase initiates as the trajectory passes a fold of fixed points.|$|R

5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field is fourteen times {{as strong as}} that of Earth, ranging from 4.2gauss (0.42 mT) at the equator to 10–14 gauss (1.0–1.4 mT) at the poles, making it the strongest in the Solar System (except for sunspots). This field {{is thought to be}} generated by eddy currents—swirling movements of conducting materials—within the liquid metallic hydrogen core. The volcanoes on the moon Io emit large amounts of sulfur dioxide forming a gas torus along the moon's orbit. The gas is ionized in the magnetosphere producing sulfur and oxygen ions. They, together with hydrogen ions originating from the atmosphere of Jupiter, form a plasma sheet in Jupiter's equatorial plane. The plasma in the sheet co-rotates with the planet causing deformation of the dipole {{magnetic field}} into that of magnetodisk. Electrons within the plasma sheet generate a strong radio signature that produces <b>bursts</b> <b>in</b> the range of 0.6–30MHz.|$|E
5|$|Scully later {{runs into}} the author at a church. He admits sending Scully the pendant and {{discusses}} with her the Sacred Heart of Jesus. She leaves, visibly shaken. Scully meets Mulder and relays her most recent encounter with the writer to Mulder. Later, Padgett woos Scully into his apartment with more character revelations. Mulder <b>bursts</b> <b>in</b> and arrests him based on accurate descriptions of the case murders in his novel, which he secretly read after discovering it in the mail. While Padgett is in custody, Maggie is murdered {{in the same fashion}} as Kevin. This establishes a de facto alibi for the author. Lacking concrete and connective evidence to the murders, and hoping Padgett might lead them to his partner in crime, Mulder releases Padgett from custody.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa {{begin to}} hear strange noises {{coming from the}} attic. Homer claims not {{to know what they}} are talking about, even though he is seen heading into the attic with a bucket of fish heads. Bart and Lisa investigate, and {{discover}} there really is a monster. Homer and Marge go into the attic, and discover that the creature has escaped, prompting Marge to call Dr. Hibbert. He explains that Bart has a twin brother named Hugo. The two were separated at birth, but it was discovered that Hugo was too evil to live in society, so the Simpsons kept him chained in the attic, where Homer fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week. The rest of the family leaves to find Hugo, leaving Bart behind, but he discovers that Hugo never left the house. Hugo takes Bart to the attic and ties him up, so that he can reattach himself, but Dr. Hibbert <b>bursts</b> <b>in</b> and knocks out Hugo. He then realizes that Hugo's scar is on the wrong side, and Bart is the evil twin. In an attempt to correct their wrong, Dr. Hibbert and the Simpson family sit down to a turkey dinner with Hugo, leaving Bart locked in the attic.|$|E

Cake hears noises from downstairs and senses Fionna is in trouble. Undaunted, Fionna uses the ice to beat Ice Queen over the head. Ice Queen pushes her off with a burst of snow which allows Fionna to get close to enough to break Prince Gumball free and knock out the Ice Queen with a broken icicle. Cake <b>bursts</b> <b>in</b> and sees Gumball {{standing}} next to Fionna in her torn dress; she jumps to the wrong conclusion and lunges at him but Fionna stops Cake and tells her it was the Ice Queen all along. Just then Ice Queen recovers and blasts Cake away from Fionna only to have Fionna knock her magic tiara off which negates her powers. The real Gumball asks Fionna on a date and is turned down; Fionna notes that she does not need a boyfriend at the moment.|$|E
5|$|Gamma-ray bursts {{were first}} {{observed}} in the late 1960s by the U.S. Vela satellites, which were built to detect gamma radiation pulses emitted by nuclear weapons tested in space. The United States suspected that the Soviet Union might attempt to conduct secret nuclear tests after signing the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963. On July 2, 1967, at 14:19 UTC, the Vela 4 and Vela 3 satellites detected a flash of gamma radiation unlike any known nuclear weapons signature. Uncertain what had happened but not considering the matter particularly urgent, the team at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, led by Ray Klebesadel, filed the data away for investigation. As additional Vela satellites were launched with better instruments, the Los Alamos team continued to find inexplicable gamma-ray <b>bursts</b> <b>in</b> their data. By analyzing the different arrival times of the bursts as detected by different satellites, the team was able to determine rough estimates for the sky positions of sixteen bursts and definitively rule out a terrestrial or solar origin. The discovery was declassified and published in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart {{return to}} the main castle and reunite with McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Ginny, whose {{possession}} by Voldemort caused all of the petrification and troubles {{over the course of}} the year, is given a reprieve by Dumbledore, who reasons that greater wizards have been duped by Voldemort before and takes great interest in the qualities of the diary, which Harry gives to him. Lucius Malfoy <b>bursts</b> <b>in</b> after this meeting, demanding to know why and how Dumbledore has returned to the school and accompanied by Dobby, revealing the family to whom he is enslaved. The house-elf also provides Harry with unspoken cues regarding the diary’s ownership: While it was Tom Riddle’s, it had been in the Malfoys’ possession, and Harry returns it, devising a scenario involving his own sock that frees Dobby from the Malfoys’ employment, thus provoking an attack on Harry, only for Dobby to jump in and save him. The petrified students are cured, the end-of-year exams are cancelled (much to Hermione’s chagrin), Hagrid comes back in the middle of the final feast, and Harry returns to Privet Drive in higher spirits than he last left it.|$|E

After the execution, Homer visits Dr. Nick, who transplants Snake's hair onto Homer's head. When Homer goes to sleep the following night, it plants its roots in Homer's brain. With the hair controlling his mind, Homer murders Apu and Moe. Bart realizes that the other two witnesses have been killed, and Homer vows to protect him. Homer locks himself and Bart in a room, but Snake's hair takes control of him. Homer tries to kill Bart with a sledgehammer.

5|$|As the Scions mourn their fallen comrade, Aymeric parleys for aid in Ishgard's {{defense against}} Nidhogg's forces. Minfilia and Alphinaud reluctantly pledge {{the support of}} the Scions and Crystal Braves, though the other Grand Company leaders decline to provide assistance, citing {{domestic}} troubles and remembering Ishgard's reticence during the three Garlean invasions. The adventurer leads a band of volunteers at the Steps of Faith, Ishgard's main bridge. They manage to repel the attack and a victory celebration is held at Ul'dah with the hopes of pressuring Ishgard to rejoin the Alliance. At the banquet, Sultana Nanamo Ul Namo privately discloses to the Warrior of Light that she plans to dissolve the monarchy in order to erode the power of the Syndicate which is the source of much of Ul'dah's corruption. However, the sultana's wine is poisoned and Teledji Adeledji <b>bursts</b> <b>in</b> to accuse the player of regicide just as Nanamo takes her last breath. Adeledji brings the adventurer forward to the banquet with his charges and denounces Raubahn for his negligence. Enraged, Raubahn murders Adeledji but Lolorito, another scheming Syndicate member, takes this as proof of Raubahn's guilt and has him arrested. The Crystal Braves are revealed to be in the pay of Lolorito and attempt to apprehend the fleeing Scions who are taken out one by one. Only a humbled Alphinaud and the Warrior of Light manage to escape with the help of Raubahn's son Pipin Tarupin. Cid takes them to Coerthas where the grateful Ishgardians grant them asylum from the Syndicate's pursuers.|$|E

When Sol falls out with both Naz and Asher, Stevie tries to help resolve the problems. She and Sol go to a club where Stevie bumps into Pippa and they are more friendly. The next day, they wake up in bed together and Stevie tries to hide Pippa from her housemates. Olly <b>bursts</b> <b>in</b> saying he will have to let the flat go as he needs his deposit, but Stevie asks for one more day.

Stevie visits her brother Rupert's grave before returning to the flat and making a list of safety violations. When her landlady Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) arrives, Stevie begs to stay, and says she will contact the council about the violations, so Roxy agrees. Stevie then invites Olly over, and he hopes to rekindle their relationship. However, she ties him naked to a chair, then humiliates him by making him walk home in a dress. She tells Masood they will have tea one day and kisses him before running off. The friends then all reunite and Stevie remarks that she loves a happy ending, saying they are now a happy family.|$|E

5|$|When fit, Miller {{opened the}} Test bowling with Lindwall, and the pair bowled in short and fiery bursts {{with the new}} ball. The English cricket {{authorities}} had agreed {{to make a new}} ball available every 55 overs. The pre-existing rule stipulated that a replacement ball would be available every 200 runs, which usually took much more time to accumulate. This played directly {{into the hands of the}} Australians with their vastly stronger pace attack, as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling. Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice bowlers for a fresh attack every 55 overs. With 13 wickets in the Tests, Miller was third among the Australians behind Lindwall and Johnston, who took 27 apiece. Owing to his fragility, Miller was used sparingly compared to the other four Australian frontline bowlers: Toshack and Johnson each delivered more than 170 overs despite playing in one less Test, while Lindwall bowled 224 and Johnston 306 in five matches. In all first-class matches, Miller took 56wickets at 17.58 and held onto 20 catches. There were many consecutive matches during the tour with no intervening rest day, so Bradman ensured that his leading pace duo remained fresh for the new ball <b>bursts</b> <b>in</b> the Tests by giving them a smaller proportion of the bowling during the tour matches. During all first-class matches, Johnston bowled 851.1 overs, Johnson 668, Lindwall 573.4 and Toshack 502, while Miller bowled only 429.4 overs. Doug Ring—who was only selected in one Test—bowled 542.4 overs, while all rounders Colin McCool and Loxton bowled 399.4 and 361.2 overs respectively. McCool did not play in any Tests, while Loxton was only entrusted with 63 overs against England. As such, in some tour matches, Miller was not asked to bowl at all, in order to keep him fresh for the Tests.|$|E
