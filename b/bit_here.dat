Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "If [...] can't resist the occasional fancy or cutesy flourishes... {{that tend to}} compromise his work, he still allows his material to exist on its own level and makes it fun to watch." [...] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote that the film was [...] "a deadly funny movie; nearly every scene is broken off with a punch line. But Parker's sense of comedy is organic; he never lets the jokes elbow the characters, or the music, out of the spotlight." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "... Parker has loosened up quite a <b>bit</b> <b>here,</b> not forcing the action {{as much as he}} did in the similar Fame and bringing a surprisingly loony touch to characters like Jimmy's Elvis-obsessed father." [...] Time magazine reviewer Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "The film offers no message, no solutions, only a great time at the movies." ...|$|E

That's where the title came from. And then {{as we used to}} play 7 nights a week, we were battling for material, we'd go for very long jams on that song, {{sometimes}} 20minutes at a time. And during the long outros, I would hear and come up with different passages, so I would often jot them down and rehearse them and add or take out a <b>bit</b> <b>here</b> and there. Today, I believe that the lyric is about a personal journey, a journey through lifetimes to your soul evolution." ...|$|E

In 2015, she {{starred in}} Mortdecai, {{alongside}} Johnny Depp, Olivia Munn, and Paul Bettany. In it, she portrayed the wife of an unscrupulous art dealer and swindler (Depp). Budgeted at US$60 million, the film only grossed US$7.7 million in North America and US$47.3 million internationally. Paltrow was featured on the track [...] "Everglow", which was included in Coldplay's seventh studio album A Head Full of Dreams (2015). In June 2017, Paltrow announced that she would {{take a break from}} acting to focus on her business Goop, stating: [...] "I’m still going to do a little <b>bit</b> <b>here</b> and there, but [...] really requires almost all of my time".|$|E

60|$|THESE dry {{details are}} of {{importance}} in one particular. They {{give me an}} opportunity of introducing one of the Mississippi's oddest peculiarities,--that of shortening its length from time to time. If you will throw a long, pliant apple-paring over your shoulder, it will pretty fairly shape itself into an average section of the Mississippi River; that is, the nine or ten hundred miles stretching from Cairo, Illinois, southward to New Orleans, the same being wonderfully crooked, with a brief straight <b>bit</b> <b>here</b> and there at wide intervals.

30|$|Since the {{watermark}} bit {{is embedded}} in the low-frequency bands of the transmitted signal, we extract the watermark bit by processing the low-frequency bands of the received signal, and despread the signal using the same PN sequence used in watermark embedding. We repeat the bit estimation process outlined above for each input block, until we have an estimate of all the transmitted watermark bits. While it is possible to combine the estimated bits sequence, we can improve the performance of the watermark extraction algorithm by postprocessing the estimated <b>bits.</b> <b>Here,</b> as we know that the embedded watermark has a chirp structure, by using a chirp detector, the original watermark message can be estimated.|$|R

The TrICE camera, composed of multi-anode photomultiplier tubes with 0. 086 degree angular spacing, is digitized continuously by a custom ASIC at 53 MHz with a dynamic range of 16 <b>bits.</b> <b>Here</b> we describe the commissioning and calibration of TrICE...|$|R

Thomas Nielsen of Power of Metal rated it at 89/100 and opined that [...] "the {{experimentation}} is less evident although still present.

Of course the compulsory Swedish <b>bits</b> <b>here</b> and there are in place and furthermore they tend to really stink up the disc with some dire cliché metalcore bits." ...|$|R
