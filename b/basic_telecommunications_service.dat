In contrast to the former GATT structure, WTO system includes an agreement covering trade in services in the form of GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services). However, since there had been no decisions from dispute settlement procedures dealing directly with GATS, the real significance of the agreement was unclear. This case was therefore crucial to understanding the realities of GATS, especially since it dealt with <b>telecommunications</b> <b>services,</b> which {{are one of the most}} strictly regulated areas of trade in services. The decision showed that vague wording on the meaning of "cost-oriented rate" specified in related agreements had clear significance, that Annex on Telecommunications has an influence that extends to regulations on <b>basic</b> <b>telecommunications</b> <b>services,</b> and that GATS and related agreements and commitments place greater restrictions on states than has generally been imagined. The WTO dispute settlement panel demonstrated the severely restrictive nature of GATS, and this may cause delays in the progress of negotiations on trade in services currently under way. Widespread discussion of the appropriateness of this decision is therefore anticipated. ...|$|R

[...] woman using a {{telecentre}} in Timbuktu Recent {{innovations in}} technology and policy are significantly increasing access to <b>basic</b> <b>telecommunications</b> <b>services</b> in the developing world. For example, in most African countires, there are now more wireless lines than fixed lines; for many new subscribers, their mobile phone is their first and only phone. This dramatic growth in connectivity is due partly to the advantages of wireless technologies in fast deployment of new networks, but perhaps more to the innovations in regulation and policy that have fostered innovation. Where countries have introduced competition in wireless/mobile services, rates have come down, and innovative wireless carriers have introduced features such as “pay as you go ” using rechargeable cards, and inexpensive text messaging. The result has been dramatic growth in access to basic communications. However, access to broadband that would allow use of the Internet’s Worldwide Web and other advanced services, is still very limited and/or expensive in most of Africa.

By adopting such legally and economically flawed policies, the United States has achieved neither trade policy’s basic goals of promoting U.

40|$|Four {{fundamental}} principles constitute {{the basis of}} international regulations pertaining to the operational aspects of telecommunications, and communications satellites in particular. Firstly, provision of global distress and safety service should be provided globally on a priority basis. Secondly, global telecommunications coverage and connectivity should be achieved. Thirdly, <b>basic</b> <b>telecommunications</b> <b>services</b> should be established within every national jurisdiction, including developing areas, and should be accessible to all individuals. Finally, universal access to <b>telecommunications</b> <b>services</b> {{on a non-discriminatory basis}} should be guaranteed. At the outset, governments have not only chosen to foster and closely regulate the development and operations of communications satellites, but also to maintain management oversight by cooperatively establishing two unique consortia, namely Intelsat and Inmarsat. This international regulatory framework, which currently continues to oversee the operational aspects of global satellite services, is essentially comprised of the Intelsat and Inmarsat Agreements adhered to by numerous member states. This framework was established a few decades ago at the inception of commercial fixed and mobile satellite services, and has not been structurally reviewed despite the changing global environment. Considering that the prime objective of international agreements is to ensure that the world community adheres to the principles outlined above, this thesis examines the relevance of the current regulatory framework {{at the dawn of the}} information age. A growing number of governments may be rewriting their own role in the operational aspects of communication satellites for the future, as they review this framework to address the challenges of the emerging environment nearly three decades after the launching of the first commercial satellite, Early Bird.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the success and continuing relevance of the universal service obligation (USO) in delivering voice telephony, basic digital data capability and broadband services to all Australians. The paper outlines the background to the National Broadband Plan being implemented by the Labor Government elected in November 2007. The costs of this plan and other funding programs implemented since 1996 are annualized and compared to the cost of the USO. The paper reveals that the USO has been eclipsed as a policy tool for making <b>basic</b> <b>telecommunications</b> <b>services</b> universally available in Australia, at least for the time being. It survives as a policy mechanism, but is contained to fixed line telephony, payphones and basic digital data capability. Its declared costs have fallen. The proposed national broadband network continues the trend towards using government funding to achieve telecommunications policy goals. This trend was initiated by the previous government with some of the proceeds from privatizing the former government monopoly, Telstra. The national broadband network also supplements this trend with a reversion to a degree of state participation in a facility (a fibre-to-the-node network serving 98 percent of the population) likely to have strong natural monopoly characteristics. The paper considers the USO as just one of many tools available to ensure basic telecommunication services are universally available and the debates about it in Australia less as arguments about where an old concept should go in the future, and more about what a very young concept really means...|$|R
40|$|There are few {{telephone}} lines {{available in the}} Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) {{and the vast majority}} of people in the DRC do not have access to <b>basic</b> <b>telecommunications</b> <b>services.</b> The obstacles to the sufficient development of the telecommunications infrastructure by either public or private sector organizations are not well understood. The three major goals of this project were: (a) to determine what telecommunications stakeholders perceive to be the primary factors that would encourage or inhibit investment in the DRC by surveying individuals who have direct knowledge of the telecommunications sector in the DRC; (b) to explore solutions for the lack of adequate investments in the telecommunications infrastructure by using a qualitative research approach based on an open-ended questionnaire with potential investors in the region; and (c) to provide recommendations for the development of an environment conducive to a successful telecommunications infrastructure in the DRe. The following three research methods were used in this study: (a) a survey of telecommunications stakeholders and scholars, (b) an open-ended questionnaire with potential telecommunications investors, and (c) a triangulation of the data collected from the survey, open-ended questionnaire, and the review of the literature. The findings indicated that telecommunications stakeholders perceive financially oriented obstacles to be the greatest obstacles to the development of telecommunications in the DRC; potential investors and domestic partners perceive organizational/policy obstacles to be the greatest issues. This gap in perceptions between the stakeholders and investors must be overcome in order to develop the sector. This study concluded that the government of the DRC should implement the following strategies to attract foreign investment and develop the sector: (a) maintain economic and political stability, (b) privatize the national operator, (c) create new legislation to promote investment and incentives in the sector, and (d) improve basic infrastructures in rural areas...|$|R

40|$|Every country {{serious about}} {{introducing}} competition {{finds that the}} transition from monopoly to competition is both economically rewarding and laden with policy dilemmas. As a new century begins, we have an essentially new market for telecommunications. Digital technology forced a re-examination of the opportunity costs of protecting traditional <b>telecommunications</b> equipment and <b>service</b> suppliers. An inefficient market for telecommunications threatened competitiveness in the computer, software, and information industry markets. Meanwhile, after dislocations created by global stagflation through the early 1980 s, developing countries became interested in privatization of state enterprises {{as a tool of}} economic reform [...] and state telephone companies were especially promising targets for privatization. Those countries began exploring options for allowing selective competition, as phone companies in major industrial countries beganlooking to foreign markets for new business opportunities. The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on <b>Basic</b> <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Services</b> created a new regime for the world market. Now we must pay close attention to regulatory fundamentals: 1) Low barriers to entry in the market for communications services. 2) Effective re-balancing of rates for services during the market transition. 3) Effective Strong interconnection policies. 4) The creation of independent regulatory authorities with the resources and power necessary to foster competition and safeguard consumer welfare. The authors assess how developing and transition economies have fared in profiting from changes in the telecommunications market. They also examine the policy challenges that remain, paying special attention to the global market and regulatory milieu fostered by the 1997 WTO Agreement. They ask what this latest transformation has taught us about wise management of this vital part of the world economy's infrastructure. They focus on the economics of managing the transition to competition, the design of proper regulatory policies and processes, and the embedding of domestic telecommunications in the world market.

50|$|The Second Computer Inquiry is {{the second}} {{proceeding}} in the FCC trilogy The Computer Inquiries, which created the FCC's policy of regulating {{the way in which}} telecommunications carriers' networks are opened up and made available to enhanced services (aka computer networks). The proceeding reformed the First Computer Inquiry which established the policy objectives that telecommunications carriers which have market power and the ability to discriminate be regulated, and computer services which were competitive, innovative, and had low barriers to entry, would not be regulated. The FCC saw great promise in the computer services industry and sought to ensure that the telecommunications network was adequately meeting the needs of the computer market. In the Second Computer Inquiry, the FCC created the <b>basic</b> <b>service</b> (<b>telecommunications</b> carriers, regulated) versus enhanced service (computer services, unregulated) dichotomy. Broadly speaking, the FCC concluded that <b>basic</b> <b>telecommunications</b> carriers networks must be open, and, if a telecommunications carrier offers enhanced services, it must do so through a separate corporate subsidiary. Everything that the telecommunications carrier sold to its own enhanced service, must be sold to all other enhanced services on the same terms and conditions. The FCC also restricted the ability of telecommunications carriers to bundle <b>telecommunications</b> <b>services</b> with customer premises equipment (CPE), creating a new competitive market for telephones and modems.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this edited book is the {{interface}} between four major trends in the global economy, which have become apparent {{during the last two}} decades. The first of these trends is the large expansion in trade between nations. International trade has been growing since the adoption of the GATT in 1947, but it has significantly accelerated over the last two decades. During the period 1980 – 2000, global trade grew very significantly. In addition, a number of new nations (e. g. China) have joined the WTO in recent years, thereby expanding the scope of application of WTO trade rules. It is widely believed today that participation in international trade is a key factor in economic development, and that increased global trade contributes to the prosperity of nations.

The second of these trends is the revolution {{that took place in the}} telecommunications sector. The first aspect of this revolution relates to market-opening reforms. For much of the twentieth century, telecommunications were organised in many countries around a monopolistic operator. The performance of these operators proved, however, to be disappointing and, in the 1980 s, some countries decided to liberalise their telecommunications sector. These countries believed that competition in telecommunications would provide for lower prices, greater innovation, and a greater degree of consumer satisfaction. Such reforms have now extended to a large number of countries. While less than twenty countries had opened the provision of any fixed <b>basic</b> <b>telecommunications</b> <b>services</b> by the mid- 1990 s, 40 per cent of all countries had done so by the year 2000, including about seventy countries which have allowed competition in basic local services.
