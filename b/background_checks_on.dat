5|$|Under federal law, private-party sellers are not {{required}} to perform <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> <b>on</b> buyers, whether at a gun show or other venue. They also are {{not required}} to record the sale, or ask for identification. This requirement is in contrast to sales by gun stores and other Federal Firearms License (FFL) holders who are required to record all sales and perform <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> <b>on</b> almost all buyers, regardless of whether the venue is their business location or a gun show. Access to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) is limited to FFL holders and FFLs are not issued to persons that only sell firearms at gun shows.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the first}} 34 games of his {{coaching}} career, Rivera {{was known for}} exceptionally conservative decision-making {{that led to a}} 2–14 record in games decided by less than a touchdown. Against the Buffalo Bills in Week 2, Rivera decided to kick a field goal while up 3 points and facing a fourth and one deep inside the Bills territory late in the fourth quarter. The Bills proceeded to drive for a touchdown on their next drive, scoring on a touchdown pass with less than 20 seconds remaining in the game. With Carolina opening the 2013 season 0–2, reports circled that the front office was already performing <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> <b>on</b> new potential head coach candidates. Rivera then changed his coaching philosophy and became a more aggressive coach. Facing a 4th and 1 from the two yard line in the first quarter against the also 0–2 New York Giants in Week 3, Rivera went for the touchdown instead of a field goal. A Mike Tolbert run found the end zone, and Carolina ended up winning the game 38–0.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Congress {{enacted the}} Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, {{amending}} the Gun Control Act of 1968. [...] "The Brady Law" [...] instituted federal <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> <b>on</b> all firearm purchasers who buy from federally licensed dealers (FFL). This law had no provisions for private firearms transactions or sales. The Brady Law originally imposed an interim measure, requiring a waiting period of 5 days before a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer may sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun to an unlicensed individual. The waiting period applied only in states without an alternate {{system that was}} deemed acceptable of conducting <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> <b>on</b> handgun purchasers. Personal transfers and sales between unlicensed Americans could also still be subject to other federal, state, and local restrictions. These interim provisions ceased to apply on November 30, 1998.|$|E

He called this absence a [...] "loophole" [...] and said that it made gun shows prime targets for criminals and gun traffickers. He requested recommendations on what actions the administration should take, including legislation.|$|E

500|$|Bell {{pleaded not}} guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. section 2281, a law prohibiting the {{intimidation}} of family members of federal agents and some forms of stalking. The charges specified that Bell had performed Internet <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> <b>on</b> federal agents he asserted were harassing him, and Bell defended his actions by saying he was using public records to defend against what he saw as harassment by government officials. Journalist Declan McCullagh wrote, [...] " [...] says, and a good number of observers agree, that the Feds are prosecuting him for doing what an investigative reporter does: Compiling information from publicly available databases, documenting what's happening, and so on. This case could set a precedent that affects the First Amendment privilege of journalists." ...|$|E
500|$|Evans {{published}} {{instructions for}} local Klan leaders that detailed {{how to run}} meetings, recruit new members, and speak to local gatherings. He advised leaders to avoid [...] "raving hysterically" [...] in favor of [...] " [...] scientific ... presentation of facts". In addition, he urged them to forbid members from bringing their Klan regalia home from meetings and to perform <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> <b>on</b> applicants. He instructed Klan members to shun vigilantism but to assist police and attempted, with some success, to recruit police officers into the Klan. Emphasizing the difference between his organization and the more violent 19th-century Ku Klux Klan, Evans formed Klan-themed groups for children. As the Klan attempted to portray itself as a movement led by cultured, well-educated people, its leaders spoke about education in the U.S. Evans believed that public schools could create a homogeneous society and saw education advocacy as an effective form of public relations.|$|E
500|$|On January 16, 2013, {{one month}} after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Obama signed 23 {{executive}} orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding gun control. He urged Congress to reintroduce an expired ban on military-style assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> <b>on</b> all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives {{for the first time since}} 2006. On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers.

500|$|In August 1988, Malaysia and Vietnam jointly {{proposed}} an involuntary repatriation agreement, which provided for Vietnamese refugees {{that failed to}} gain admittance to Western countries to be counselled to return to Vietnam. A few Vietnamese government delegations were deployed to conduct [...] outreach sessions {{at some of the}} refugee camps. This arrangement was considered unsuccessful because less [...] than 40 individuals registered for the voluntary repatriation programme between 1988 and 1989. A deadline was set for 14 March 1989, whereby all Vietnamese who arrived before that date would automatically be considered refugees and all refugees arriving after that date would undergo a screening process to assess whether they qualified for refugee status. The screening process was proposed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in June 1988; it involved thorough <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> <b>on</b> arrivals to determine whether they qualify for refugee status to be sent to any Western countries that were willing to accept them. Within 10 months, 4,000 of 9,000 refugees were sent to Western countries. In the same period, an additional 11,000 refuges arrived in Malaysia.|$|E
500|$|In February 1945, Uanna assumed {{command of}} the 1st Technical Service Detachment, which was {{attached}} to the 509th Composite Group, the Army Air Force unit created to deliver the first atomic bomb. He became responsible for the security clearance of its personnel. Uanna arrived with orders from Lieutenant Colonel John Lansdale Jr., the Manhattan Project's head of security, and a briefcase containing dossiers on members of the 393d Bomb Squadron, the combat element of the 509th Composite Group. Uanna had particular concerns about Captain Claude Eatherly. The dossier indicated that Eatherly was a gambler, with an [...] "emotional problem". The commander of the 509th Composite Group, Lieutenant Colonel Paul W. Tibbets Jr., opted to keep Eatherly, based on his piloting skills. <b>Background</b> <b>checks</b> <b>on</b> the 1st Ordnance Squadron revealed that it had several escaped convicts in its ranks. Uanna surmised that enlisting in the Army under false names was an easy way of escaping detection during wartime. Since skilled technicians were hard to find, Tibbets elected to keep them, threatening to send them back to prison for any dereliction of duty or security breaches.|$|E
500|$|A {{secondary}} {{question of}} the Filegate controversy revolved around what the Office of Personnel Security was, who had authorized the hiring of Livingstone, and whether he was qualified for the job. [...] The Office was not responsible for actual White House security, as that was the charge of the United States Secret Service, nor did it perform <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> <b>on</b> potential White House employees, a task done by the FBI, nor did it keep the regular personnel files of employees, which were held in a different office within the White House. Rather, its role was {{to keep track of}} who was employed by the White House, make sure their security clearances were up to date, and give security briefings to new hires. [...] Nevertheless, Livingstone seemed to lack qualifications for even this position; he had worked on a number of Democratic Party campaigns and transitions, including being an advance man for the Clinton-Gore 1992 campaign, and his only prior job in the [...] "security" [...] field was that of a local bar bouncer at a Washington, D.C., night club. (At the congressional hearings, Livingstone objected to [...] "false and unfair caricatures of who I am. [...] I have worked hard for little or no pay in political campaigns for candidates who I felt would make this country a better place to live." [...] In later years Livingstone would continue to maintain on the internet that he had been qualified for the position, that the First Lady had signed off on hiring him, and that his character had been maligned by the general media). Clinton opponents stated that Livingstone had the highest level of security clearances in the U.S. government. White House officials could not explain why Livingstone was hired, nor who had hired him.|$|E
