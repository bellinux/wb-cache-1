5|$|The {{ability to}} {{excavate}} allows woodpeckers to obtain tree sap, {{an important source}} of food for some species. Most famously, the sapsuckers (genus Sphyrapicus) feed in this fashion, but the technique is not restricted to these, and others such as the acorn woodpecker and white-headed woodpecker also feed on sap. It was once thought that the technique was restricted to the New World, <b>but</b> <b>Old</b> World species, such as the Arabian woodpecker and great spotted woodpecker, also feed in this way.|$|E

Famous dishes of Old Dhaka are kebabs, naans, bakharkhani, kachchi and pakki biriyani, haleem, mutton bhuni kichuri, mutton tehari etc. Dhakai Bakarkhani is the traditional food or snack of the people of old Dhaka. It is famous for its quality and taste and it was highly praised by the royal court of the Mughal Empire in Delhi.|$|E
5|$|Old English is very {{different}} from Modern English and difficult for 21st-century English speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern German, and its closest relative is Old Frisian. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms, and word order was much freer than in Modern English. Modern English has case forms in pronouns (he, him, his) and a few verb endings (I have, he has), <b>but</b> <b>Old</b> English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more person and number endings.|$|E

5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the dodo is unknown, <b>but</b> <b>old</b> descriptions {{suggest that it}} inhabited the woods on the drier coastal areas of south and west Mauritius. This view {{is supported by the}} fact that the Mare aux Songes swamp, where most dodo remains have been excavated, is close to the sea in south-eastern Mauritius. Such a limited distribution across the island could well have contributed to its extinction. A 1601 map from the Gelderland journal shows a small island off the coast of Mauritius where dodos were caught. Julian Hume has suggested this island was l’île aux Benitiers in Tamarin Bay, on the west coast of Mauritius. Subfossil bones have also been found inside caves in highland areas, indicating that it once occurred on mountains. Work at the Mare aux Songes swamp has shown that its habitat was dominated by tambalacoque and Pandanus trees and endemic palms. The near-coastal placement and wetness of the Mare aux Songes led to a high diversity of plant species, whereas the surrounding areas were drier.|$|E

25|$|The NTSC and PAL TV norms {{call for}} a {{compliant}} TV screen to display an electrically black and white signal (minimal color saturation) at a color temperature of 6500K. On many consumer-grade televisions, {{there is a very}} noticeable deviation from this requirement. However, higher-end consumer-grade televisions can have their color temperatures adjusted to 6500K by using a preprogrammed setting or a custom calibration. Current versions of ATSC explicitly call for the color temperature data {{to be included in the}} data stream, <b>but</b> <b>old</b> versions of ATSC allowed this data to be omitted. In this case, current versions of ATSC cite default colorimetry standards depending on the format. Both of the cited standards specify a 6500K color temperature.|$|E

25|$|It is {{also one}} of only two {{denominations}} (the other being the cent) minted in every year from its inception during the first decade of mint operation. However, the order was given by President Thomas Jefferson to halt silver dollar production due to the continued exportation of U.S. dollars. The Spanish 8 Reales, which was slightly heavier than the U.S. dollar, nonetheless traded at a 1-to-1 ratio. So U.S. dollars went to the Caribbean, were traded for heavier 8 Reales, and those were then brought back to the U.S., where they would be recoined for free into more U.S. dollars; the difference in silver, then, was kept by the exporter. This ensured that no dollars would circulate in the U.S., but would instead be exported for their heavier counterparts overseas, leaving little <b>but</b> <b>old,</b> foreign money to circulate in the United States in a process known as Gresham's Law.|$|E
25|$|Kǎishū style (traditional regular script) — {{still in}} use today — and {{attributed}} to Wang Xizhi (王羲之, 303-361) and his followers, is even more regularized. Its spread was encouraged by Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang (926-933), who ordered the printing of the classics using new wooden blocks in Kaishu. Printing technologies here allowed shapes to stabilize. The Kaishu shape of characters 1000 years ago was mostly similar to {{that at the end}} of Imperial China. But small changes have been made, for example in the shape of 广 which is not absolutely the same in the Kangxi Dictionary of 1716 as in modern books. The Kangxi and current shapes have tiny differences, while stroke order is still the same, according to old style., 厂 or 广, p.41. The 2007 common shape for those characters does not clearly show the stroke order, <b>but</b> <b>old</b> versions, visible on the Kangxi Zidian p.41 clearly allow the stroke order to be determined.|$|E
25|$|French General Pierre Jadart Dumerbion {{commanded}} the Army of Italy. Competent <b>but</b> <b>old,</b> {{he had seen}} too many generals sent to the guillotine for failing or for having the wrong political views. Two of his predecessors suffered this fate, Brunet on 15 November 1793 and Biron on 31 December 1793. In order {{to stay out of}} trouble, Dumerbion determined to consult the all-powerful Representatives on mission before acting. At this time, the representatives were Augustin Robespierre and Antoine Christophe Saliceti and both were influenced by freshly-promoted General of Brigade Napoleon Bonaparte, the army's new artillery chief. Bonaparte drew up a strategic plan and Dumerbion listened. Bonaparte planned to launch a drive northeast along the coast to capture Oneglia, a nest of Sardinian privateers that preyed on the Genoa-to-Nice grain trade. From Oneglia, the French would turn north to seize Ormea, outflanking the enemy's defenses from the east. While these moves were implemented, the main army would distract the Coalition defenders by advancing directly on Saorge. Of Dumerbion's 43,000-man field army, 20,000 men formed the attacking force, divided into three columns and a reserve.|$|E
