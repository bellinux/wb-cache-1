40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} {{improvements}} of the Suto et al. (2000) model, {{in the light}} of recent theoretical developments (new theoretical mass functions, a more accurate mass-temperature relation and an improved bias model) to predict the clustering properties of galaxy clusters and to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters. We re-derive the two-point correlation function of clusters of galaxies for OCDM and LambdaCDM cosmological models, and we compare these results with the observed spatial correlation function for clusters in RASS 1 (ROSAT All-Sky Survey 1), and in XBACs (X-RAY <b>Brighest</b> Abell-Type) samples. The comparison shows that the best agreement is obtained for the LambdaCDM model with Omega= 0. 3. The values of the correlation length obtained, (r_≃ 28. 2 ± 5. 2 h^- 1 Mpc for LambdaCDM), are larger than those found in the literature and comparable with the results found in Borgani, Plionis & Kolokotronis (1999).

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{prospects}} for bounding and perhaps even measuring quantum gravity effects on the dispersion of light using the highest energy photons produced in gamma ray bursts measured by the Fermi telescope. These prospects are <b>brigher</b> than {{might have been expected}} as in the first 10 months of operation Fermi has reported so far eight events with photons over 100 MeV seen by its Large Area Telescope (LAT). We review features of these events which may bear on Planck scale phenomenology and we discuss the possible implications for the alternative scenarios for in-vacua dispersion coming from breaking or deforming of Poincare invariance. Among these are semi-conservative bounds, which rely on some relatively weak assumptions about the sources, on subluminal and superluminal in-vacuo dispersion. We also propose that {{it may be possible to}} look for the arrival of still higher energy photons and neutrinos from GRB's with energies in the range 10 ^ 14 - 10 ^ 17 eV. In some cases the quantum gravity dispersion effect would predict these arrivals to be delayed or advanced by days to months from the GRB, giving a clean separation of astrophysical source and spacetime propagation effects.

40|$|We {{report on}} first {{results of an}} ongoing effort to image {{a small sample of}} high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs) with milliarcsecond (mas) resolution, using very-long-baseline {{interferometry}} (VLBI) techniques. Here, we present 1. 7 and 5. 0 GHz VLBA observations of B 3 J 2330 + 3927, a radio galaxy at z= 3. 087. Those observations, combined with 8. 4 GHz VLA-A observations, have helped us interpret the source radio morphology, and most of our results have already been published (Perez-Torres & De Breuck 2005). In particular, we pinpointed the core of the radio galaxy, and also detected both radio lobes, which have a very asymmetric flux density ratio, R> 11. Contrary to what is seen in other radio galaxies, it is the radio lobe furthest from the nucleus which is the <b>brighest.</b> Almost all of the Ly-alpha emission is seen between the nucleus and the furthest radio lobe, which is also unlike all other radio galaxies. The values of radio lobe distance ratio, and flux density ratio, as well as the fraction of core emission make of B 3 J 2330 + 3927 an extremely asymmetric source, and challenges unification models that explain the differences between quasars and radio galaxies as due to orientation effects.

40|$|AbstractThe {{luminance}} of a squarewave grating was modulated in {{a manner}} such that every other stripe temporally varied between bright and dark and the intervening stripes had constant luminance. This produces brightness induction in the constant stripes, roughly in antiphase to the luminance modulation. We used this stimulus as a probe to explore the temporal properties of bright ness induction and the mechanisms determining perceived brightness. Over a range of spatial frequencies we measured: (1) the highest temporal frequency at which brightness induction Occurs; (2) the magnitude of induced brightness; and (3) the temporal phase of the induced <b>brigh</b> ness modulation. We find that brightness induction ceases with luminance modulation above a c toff temporal frequency that depends on spatial frequency. The magnitude of induced <b>brigh</b> ness modulation is greatest at low spatial frequencies and low temporal frequencies. Induced brightness lags behind the luminance modulation and this phase lag increases as spatial frequency decreases. All of these findings {{can be understood as}} consequences of an induction process that takes longer to complete as the induction region increases in size...|$|E

The first were identified as flares from ubiquitous active cool dwarf stars. It was hypothesized that the second may have been from distant Be-neutron star binaries.

40|$|The Geminga pulsar, {{one of the}} <b>brighest</b> gamma-ray sources, is a {{promising}} candidate for emission of very-high-energy (VHE > 100 GeV) pulsed gamma rays. Also, detection of a large nebula has been claimed by water Cherenkov instruments. We performed deep observations of Geminga with the MAGIC telescopes, yielding 63 h of good-quality data, and searched for emission from the pulsar and pulsar wind nebula. We {{did not find any}} significant detection, and derived 95 % confidence level upper limits. The resulting upper limits of 5. 3 × 10 - 13 TeV cm- 2 s- 1 for the Geminga pulsar and 3. 5 × 10 - 12 TeV cm- 2 s- 1 for the surrounding nebula at 50 GeV are the mostconstraining ones obtained so far at VHE. To complement the VHE observations, we also analyzed 5 yr of Fermi-LAT data from Geminga, finding that the sub-exponential cut-off is preferred over the exponential cut-off that has been typically used in the literature. We also find that, above 10 GeV, the gamma-ray spectra from Geminga can be described with a power law with index softer than 5. The extrapolation of the power-law Fermi-LAT pulsed spectra to VHE goes well below the MAGIC upper limits, indicating that the detection of pulsed emission from Geminga with the current generation of Cherenkov telescopes is very difficult. © ESO, 2016...|$|R
40|$|We combine our {{compilation}} of photometry of M 31 globular cluster and probable cluster candidates with new near-infrared photometry for 30 objects. Using these data we determine the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF) in multiple filters for the M 31 halo clusters. We find a GCLF peak and dispersion of V_ 0 ^ 0 = 16. 84 +/- 0. 11, sigma_t= 0. 93 +/- 0. 13 (Gaussian sigma = 1. 20 +/- 0. 14), {{consistent with previous}} results. The halo GCLF peak colors (e. g., B^ 0 _ 0 - V^ 0 _ 0) {{are consistent with the}} average cluster colors. We also measure V-band GCLF parameters for several other subsamples of the M 31 globular cluster population. The inner third of the clusters have a GCLF peak significantly <b>brigher</b> than that of the outer clusters (delta V =~ 0. 5 mag). Dividing the sample by both galacticentric distance and metallicity, we find that the GCLF also varies with metallicity, as the metal-poor clusters are on average 0. 36 mag fainter than the metal-rich clusters. Our modeling of the catalog selection effects suggests that they are not the cause of the measured differences, but a more complete, less-contaminated M 31 cluster catalog is required for confirmation. Our results imply that dynamical destruction is not the only factor causing variation in the M 31 GCLF: metallicity, age, and cluster initial mass function may also be important.
