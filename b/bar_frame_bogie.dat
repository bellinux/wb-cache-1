50|$|Locomotives EF10 18 and 19 {{continued}} {{with the same}} rounded body styling as EF10 17, but used a similar <b>bar</b> <b>frame</b> <b>bogie</b> design to the first batch of locomotives.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, Churchward's <b>bar</b> <b>framed</b> <b>bogie</b> {{which had}} been adapted for the {{original}} Hall prototype in 1924 {{was replaced by a}} plate frame structure with individual springing. There were changes, too, above the running board. Hawksworth decided that the declining quality of coal reaching Great Western depots necessitated a higher degree of superheating. A larger three-row superheater and header regulator were fitted into Swindon No.1 boiler. Improvements were subsequently made to the draughting on some engines, while others were fitted with hopper ashpans.|$|R
50|$|Between 1951 and 1953, Henschel and Son built twenty for Rhodesia Railways, their 19th class, {{numbered}} in {{the range}} from 316 to 335. They had tenders similar to the SAR Torpedo type, but with plate <b>frame</b> <b>bogies</b> instead of cast <b>frame</b> Buckeye <b>bogies.</b>|$|R

50|$|To reduce weight, the {{locomotives}} had unusual inside <b>framed</b> <b>bogies.</b> Combined {{with the}} high driving position and rounded body, this gave the V 200 a very distinctive appearance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{frame of}} the ICF bogie is a {{fabricated}} structure made up of mild steel. Main sub-assemblies of <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> viz. side frames, transoms, headstocks, longitudinal forms the skeleton of the <b>bogie</b> <b>frame.</b> The sub assemblies are fabricated from flanges, webs, channels and Ribs by welding process. Various types of brackets are welded to the frame {{for the purpose of}} primary and secondary suspension arrangement, alternator suspension arrangement and brake rigging arrangement. Various brackets viz. brake hanger brackets, brake lever hanger brackets, brake cylinder fixing brackets, anchor link brackets, bolster spring suspension brackets, alternator suspension brackets, belt tensioning bracket/s, axle box guides, suspension straps are welded on the <b>bogie</b> <b>frames.</b> It involves 40 meters (app.) of welding in a single conventional <b>bogie</b> <b>frame.</b> Based on load carrying capacity per axle, the conventional <b>bogie</b> <b>frames</b> are grouped into two types. They are 13 ton <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> and 16 ton <b>bogie</b> <b>frame.</b> 13 ton <b>bogie</b> <b>frames</b> are being used in the bogies of all non-AC mainline coaches and 16 ton <b>bogie</b> <b>frames</b> are being used in bogies of all AC coaches, power cars and diesel multiple unit trailer coaches.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper has}} {{performed}} the fatigue strength evaluation for the <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> of Korean tilting train. In order {{to verify the}} structural safety of the <b>bogie</b> <b>frame,</b> we firstly investigated the loading condition imposed on the <b>bogie</b> <b>frame.</b> The <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> of the tilting train is exposed to the more severe loadings compared with the conventional one because of the tilting of the carbody and the high-speed curve negotiation. We have conducted some multi-body dynamic analyses to extract the load condition by tilting on curve. The finite element analysis is used to obtain the stress distribution. Through this study, we could make sure {{the safety of the}} tilting <b>bogie</b> <b>frame...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the structural analysis, load tests and combined {{stress of the}} <b>bogie</b> <b>frame.</b> It seeks to identify the structural safety of the <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> when the <b>bogie</b> is assembled on the train and a train service is implemented. The bogie consists of the <b>bogie</b> <b>frame,</b> suspension, wheels, brakes and transmission, etc. The <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> {{can be considered as}} {{the most important part of}} the bogie. The analysis and tests were evaluated using JIS E 4207 standards and performance test standards for urban rail vehicles...|$|R
50|$|The OnRail DH 1004 were rebuilt from V 100's in {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s by Vossloh {{retaining}} the <b>frame,</b> <b>bogies</b> and transmission but with the engine and bodywork replaced. The locomotives are used at ports and on private railways.|$|R
40|$|It {{would be}} {{desirable}} {{to obtain a}} stress profile of a <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> {{with reference to the}} railway track on which it runs. In this paper a structural analysis of a typical open-shaped railway vehicle <b>bogie</b> <b>frame,</b> based on a computer dynamic simulation of a real operating environment, is carried out. The analysis has confirmed that this type of <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> is very sensitive to torsion, which suggests that the twist loading case should be carefully investigated if an open-shaped <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> is involved in a particular bogie. It is also shown that the potential failure of a new <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> may be ascertained at the design stage by putting the <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> in a simulated service environment...|$|R
50|$|As built, {{the tender}} had a coal {{capacity}} of 10 lt t and a water capacity of 4000 imp gal, {{with an average}} maximum axle load of 12 lt 15 lcwt kg. It rode on diamond <b>frame</b> <b>bogies</b> with a 5 ft wheelbase per bogie.|$|R
2500|$|The main frames were [...] thick cut <b>bar</b> <b>frames.</b> On the SAR, the <b>bar</b> <b>frame</b> had {{previously}} only been employed on the German-built Class GCA 2-6-2+2-6-2 Garratt.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the fatigue life and strength of a GFRP <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> for urban subway train. The <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> was made of a GEP 224 glass fiber/epoxy 4 -harness satin woven composite. In order to obtain the S-N curve for a composite material applied to composite <b>bogie</b> <b>frame,</b> the tension-compression fatigue test was done with different stacking sequence of warp-direction, fill-direction, and 0 °/ 90 °-direction, respectively. The fatigue test was conducted with stress ratio (R) of - 1, frequency of 5 Hz and endurance limit of 107. The fatigue strength of <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> was evaluated by Goodman diagram according to the JIS E 4207. The results show that fatigue life and strength of a GFRP composite bogie have satisfied the requirements of JIS E 4207. Also, the GFRP composite <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> had a good fatigue performance in comparison with conventional metal <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> based on SM 490 A, considering its weight...|$|R

50|$|A {{bogie bolster}} {{is the central}} section of the bogie that carries the entire weight of a coach's under <b>frame.</b> The <b>bogie</b> pivots around it using the center pivot pin. It couples to the <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> at each end using the {{secondary}} suspension system (typically coil springs and spring plank).|$|R

5000|$|... 17 Frame [...] - [...] Steel beams {{around which}} the {{locomotive}} is built. The wheels run in slots within the frames, and the cab, fire box, boiler and smoke box are mounted on top. American locomotives usually have <b>bar</b> <b>frames</b> (made from steel bar) or cast steel <b>frames</b> (see Bury <b>bar</b> <b>frame</b> locomotive), while British locomotives usually have plate frames (made from steel plate).|$|R
5000|$|Like the Class B Hendrie D, the ALCO {{locomotive}} {{also used}} Walschaerts valve gear, {{but it had}} a <b>bar</b> <b>frame,</b> larger 24 in diameter pistons, lower [...] boiler pressure, superheating, an American type cab and some other features which were typical of American design, such as high running boards. It was the first superheated locomotive to be acquired by the NGR and also the first with a <b>bar</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{secondary}} suspension {{arrangement of the}} ICF bogies is through bolster springs. The bogie bolster is not bolted or welded anywhere to the <b>bogie</b> <b>frame.</b> It {{is attached to the}} <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> through the anchor link. The anchor link is a tubular structure with cylindrical housing on both the ends. The cylindrical housings have silent blocks placed in them. The anchor link is fixed to the bogie bolster and the <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> with the help of steel brackets welded to the bogie bolster and the <b>bogie</b> <b>frame.</b> Both the ends of the anchor link act as a hinge and allow movement of the bogie bolster when the coach is moving on a curved track.|$|R

50|$|These tenders had {{a modern}} {{appearance}}, with flush sides {{all the way}} to the top of the coal bunker. They were very similar in appearance to those Type XF tenders which had been rebuilt by the SAR by mounting a completely new upper structure on the existing underframes. They had the same water capacity of 3000 imp gal and coal capacity of 10 lt t as the Type XF, but rode on diamond <b>frame</b> <b>bogies</b> with a 12 in longer wheelbase per bogie.|$|R
50|$|A {{stretcher}} frame {{constructed from}} strainer bars {{should not be}} confused with one constructed from stretcher bars. Strainer bars are fixed to one another with wood glue, nails or staples, often in conjunction. Strainer <b>bar</b> <b>frames</b> are often reinforced with other fixed elements such as corner and cross braces. These frames are not built to accommodate the insertion of tightening keys into their corners to further tighten the canvas stretched upon them as a stretcher <b>bar</b> <b>frame</b> would.|$|R
5000|$|Axle box {{suspensions}} absorb shocks {{between the}} axle bearings and the <b>bogie</b> <b>frame.</b> The axle box suspension usually {{consists of a}} spring between the <b>bogie</b> <b>frame</b> and axle bearings to permit up-and-down movement, and sliders to prevent lateral movement. A more modern design uses solid rubber springs.|$|R
25|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was greatly}} improved from the Class NG G11, with trailing wheels added to each engine unit, outside <b>bar</b> <b>frames</b> instead of plate frames, round-topped fireboxes instead of Belpaire fireboxes, and larger dimensions in most respects except the grate area. They were superheated and sported an extremely compact arrangement of Walschaerts valve gear and outside <b>bar</b> <b>frames.</b> The leading wheels were arranged as conventional pony trucks, while the inner carrying wheels were built to the Gölsdorf system which allowed the axle some lateral movement.|$|R
50|$|The {{patented}} type of {{tandem compound}} cylinders were arranged outside the <b>bar</b> <b>frame.</b> The high-pressure cylinders, in front, were 13 in in diameter, while the low-pressure cylinders, arranged behind, were 23 in in diameter, {{with a common}} stroke of 26 in. Each cylinder, with its valve chest, was cast separately and separate from the saddle casting. The high-pressure cylinders were bolted onto {{the front of the}} low-pressure cylinders which, in turn, were bolted onto the saddle casting which was fitted to the main <b>bar</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R

50|$|CGR Chief Locomotive Superintendent H.M. Beatty {{was equally}} {{impressed}} by the sturdy and simple construction and the good steaming qualities of these locomotives. The <b>bar</b> <b>frame</b> allowed the firebox {{to be placed on}} top of it and to make it 2 in wider than what would have been possible with a plate frame on Cape gauge. Beatty became a firm believer in <b>bar</b> <b>frames,</b> to the extent that practically all his subsequent locomotive designs had such frames. Plate frames were only used again on locomotives which were acquired on repeat orders for existing locomotive types.|$|R
