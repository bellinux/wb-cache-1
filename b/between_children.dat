5|$|CTW {{solicited}} the Educational Testing Service (ETS) {{to conduct}} its summative research. CTW and ETS hired and trained coordinators, testers, and observers from local communities to conduct these studies. The most relevant {{tests of the}} show's effectiveness were comparisons <b>between</b> <b>children</b> who watched it regularly {{and those who did}} not. After the first season, however, Sesame Street was so widely watched that it was difficult to make this distinction; ETS began to have problems finding subjects for their non-viewing groups, which weakened the experimental design. It solved this problem by selecting control-group households from areas that did not broadcast the show. Instead of using groups of viewers and non-viewers, later large-scale studies used statistical designs and methods for estimating cause-effect relationships.|$|E

5|$|Externalizing {{disorders}} (i.e., acting-out disorders) show {{a clearer}} link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents, as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis. Interestingly, a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification <b>between</b> <b>children</b> with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ). This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification, and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.|$|E

Researchers used hierarchical logistic regression to compare rates of revictimization and the strength of the association <b>between</b> <b>child</b> abuse and adult victimization using two measures of child physical abuse and four measures of child sexual abuse. Incarcerated women had higher rates of revictimization than did nonincarcerated women. Child abuse and adult incarceration were directly associated with adult victimization; interactions <b>between</b> <b>child</b> abuse and incarceration were associated with adult victimization for only a few definitions of child abuse. Findings suggest that the relationship <b>between</b> <b>child</b> abuse and adult victimization is robust and that factors in incarcerated women’s lives further increase the probability of adult victimization.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{evolution}} of child labour, fertility and human capital in an economy characterized by two type of individuals, low and high skilled workers. This heterogeneity allows for an endogenous analysis of inequality generated by child labour. More specifically, according to empirical evidence, we oer an explanation for the emergence of a vicious cycle <b>between</b> <b>child</b> labour and inequality. The basic intuition behind this result is the interdependence <b>between</b> <b>child</b> labour and fertility choices: unskilled parents tend to have a high number of children and to send them to work whereas skilled parents tend to have a low fertility rate and a high investment in education. The differential fertility between high and low skilled increases the fraction of unskilled workers in the labour market which in turns reduces unskilled wage. The fact that children can oers only unskilled labor reinforces such process creating a vicious cycle <b>between</b> <b>child</b> labour and inequality. ...|$|R

25|$|During {{most of the}} 20th century, {{mental illness}} was {{believed}} to be caused by problematic relationships <b>between</b> <b>children</b> and their parents.

40|$|Background: There {{is growing}} {{research}} {{interest in the}} association between parental control and child anxiety. Parental control may enhance child anxiety and parents may exert control in anticipation of their child's anxiety-related distress. Moreover, high levels of anxiety in parents could influence the development of parental control. Whereas past reviews have solely examined the relation <b>between</b> <b>child</b> anxiety and parental control, this meta-analysis focuses on the associations <b>between</b> both <b>child</b> and parent anxiety and parental control. Methods: The associations of parent anxiety and child anxiety with observed parental control (k= 23 studies, N= 1, 305 parent-child dyads) were investigated using a meta-analytic approach. Moreover, factors were identified that may function as moderators of these relations, such as parent and child gender, family socioeconomic status, child age, and design and measurement characteristics. Results: A substantial association <b>between</b> <b>child</b> anxiety and parental control (d=. 58) was found. Moderator analyses yielded the strongest effect sizes for studies with an overrepresentation of girls, for school-aged children, for families from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, and for studies using a discussion task to assess parental control. Although a nonsignificant relation was found for the relation between parent anxiety and parental control (d=. 08), small but significant effects were found for school-aged children, for studies using a discussion task to assess parental control, and for samples with an overrepresentation of boys. Conclusions: As {{the direction of the}} association <b>between</b> <b>child</b> anxiety and parental control is unknown, future studies should use experimental designs to further explore the causal link <b>between</b> <b>child</b> anxiety and parental control...|$|R
