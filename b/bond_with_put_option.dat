40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} the utility indiﬀerence price of interest rate products {{and the risk}} associated with these. Such products can be compared <b>with</b> <b>put</b> <b>options</b> and are here considered to be written on a non-tradeable asset which can be hedged with a correlated asset. Initially, {{we look at the}} case where both the tradeable and non-tradeable assets can be modeled by two geometric Brownian motions. This model is later extended to the case where it is assumed that the tradeable asset follows a Lévy process. The paper is based on the article ’Utility indiﬀerence pricing of interest- rate guarantees’ by Fred Espen Benth and Frank Proske, but is meant to be an independent paper. The deﬁnitions of the utility indiﬀerence price and the residual risk remaining after hedging are the same as in their paper. The residual risk is measured with several different risk measures such as Value at Risk, Conditional Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall. These measures, with others, are closely examined and evaluated. Numerical examples are included showing that the utility indifference price is lower for negative correlation than for positive and that the price can be even lower if the tradeable asset follows a Lévy process. Thus, if e. g. life companies can hedge in assets allowing jumps, and that are negatively correlated with their pension fund, they may offer lower prices with prac- tically unaltered measures of risk. Analysis of the pricing and hedging of interest rate guarantees are not only relevant for life companies, but also for other ﬁnancial institutions oﬀering investment products where there is a guaranteed least rate of return...|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of option markets throughout the world, option pricing {{has become an}} important field in financial engineering. Among a variety of option pricing models, volatility of underlying asset is associated with risk and uncertainty, and hence is treated {{as one of the}} key factors affecting the price of an option. In particular, in the framework of the Black-Scholes option pricing model, volatility of the underlying stock is the only unobservable variable, and has attracted a large amount of attention of both academics and practitioners. This thesis is concerned with the implied volatility in the Australian index option market. Two interesting problems are examined. First, the relation between implied volatility and subsequently realized volatility is investigated by using the S&P/ASX 200 (XJO) index options over a five-year period from April 2001 to March 2006. Unlike the S&P 100 index options in the US market, the XJO index options are traded infrequently, in low volumes, and with a long maturity cycle. This implies that the errors-in-variable problem for the measurement of implied volatility is more likely to exist. After accounting for this problem by the instrumental variable method, it is found that both call and <b>put</b> <b>options</b> implied volatilities are nearly unbiased and superior to historical volatility in forecasting future realized volatility. Second, the volatility structure implied by the XJO index options is examined during the period from April 2001 to June 2005. The volatility structure with respect to moneyness and time to maturity are investigated for both call and <b>put</b> <b>option</b> price series. It is found that the volatility smile largely exists, <b>with</b> call (<b>put)</b> <b>option</b> implied volatilities decreasing monotonically as the call (put) goes deeper out of the money (in the money). This result is consistent with the welldocumented evidence of volatility smile on other index options since the stock market crash of 1987. In summary, this thesis presents some important findings on the volatility inferred from the XJO index options traded on the ASX...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Investigating the {{valuation}} of dynamic fund protection under hidden Markov models Originality: Compared <b>with</b> traditional <b>put</b> <b>options,</b> dynamic fund protection (DFP) plans protect investors {{from the whole}} investment period against financial risks. This feature {{is the main reason}} why the dynamic fund protection plans have attracted increasing attention from both academic researchers and market practitioners. On the other hand, hidden Markov models present a natural choice for modelling transitions in hidden states of an economy. So it is of significant and practical value to investigate the pricing of dynamic fund protection under hidden Markov models. Design/methodology/approach: The parameters of our model are modulated by a continuous-time, finite-state hidden Markov chain. Firstly, we introduce approaches to estimate the states of the hidden Markov chain. We then employ the Esscher transform to select a pricing kernel for valuing the DFP and adopt the approach partial differential equations to value dynamic fund protections. Findings: Findings include numerical examples to illustrate our approach to value the dynamic fund protection, methods to calculate the price of dynamic fund protection and comparison of the prices in different economy states. Sensitivity tests are also conducted to assess the impacts of different parameters on dynamic fund protection prices. 2 page(s...|$|R
