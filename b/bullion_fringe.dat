50|$|<b>Bullion</b> <b>fringe,</b> {{twisted yarn}} which {{generally}} contains threads of silver or gold. The name derives from bullion hose, {{which had a}} twisted element at the top that resembled this type of fringe. Modern <b>bullion</b> <b>fringe</b> varies widely in texture and width, but generally is only 3 to 9 in in length.|$|E
50|$|The new silk window draperies are ecru in color, {{accented with}} stripes of peacock blue {{intended}} {{to mimic the}} Kailua blue color of the White House china (which in turn mimics the waters of President Obama's home state of Hawaii). Fabric for the draperies was manufactured by an undisclosed firm in Pennsylvania. The window valances feature heavy swags, with gold <b>bullion</b> <b>fringe,</b> and reflect similar window treatments from the 1800s. The drapes hang from carved and gilded poles whose design echoes that of similar drapery poles in the Red Room and Green Room. The walls and moldings were repainted in various shades of white and glazed, to highlight their details.|$|E
5000|$|Epaulettes are {{fastened}} to the shoulder by a shoulder strap or [...] "passant", a small strap parallel to the shoulder seam, and the button near the collar, or by laces {{on the underside of}} the epaulette passing through holes in the shoulder of the coat. Colloquially, any shoulder straps with marks are also called epaulettes. The placement of the epaulette, its color and the length and diameter of its <b>bullion</b> <b>fringe</b> are used to signify the wearer's rank. At the join of the fringe and the shoulderpiece is often a metal piece in the form of a crescent. Although originally worn in the field, epaulettes are now normally limited to dress or ceremonial military uniforms.|$|E
50|$|An {{intermediate}} form in some services, {{such as the}} Russian Army, is {{the shoulder}} board, which neither has a fringe nor extends beyond the shoulder seam. This originated during the 19th century as a simplified version for service wear of the heavy and conspicuous full dress epaulette with <b>bullion</b> <b>fringes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Until 1858, subedars wore two epaulettes {{with small}} <b>bullion</b> <b>fringes</b> on each shoulder. After 1858, they wore two crossed golden swords, or, in the Gurkha regiments, two crossed golden kukris, {{on each side}} of the collar of the tunic or on the right breast of the kurta. After 1900, subedars wore two pips on each shoulder. A red-yellow-red ribbon was {{introduced}} under each pip after World War I. After World War II, this ribbon was moved to lie between the shoulder title and the rank insignia (two brass stars on both shoulders).|$|R
50|$|Until 1914, {{officers}} of most French Army infantry regiments wore gold epaulettes in full dress, while those of mounted units wore silver. No insignia was worn on the epaulette itself, though the <b>bullion</b> <b>fringe</b> {{falling from the}} crescent differed according to rank. Other ranks of most branches of the infantry, as well as cuirassiers wore detachable epaulettes of various colours (red for line infantry, green for Chasseurs, yellow for Colonial Infantry etc.) with woollen fringes, of a traditional pattern that dated back to the 18th Century. Other cavalry such as hussars, dragoons and chasseurs à cheval wore special epaulettes of a style originally intended to deflect sword blows from the shoulder. In the modern French Army, epaulettes are still worn by those units retaining 19th-century-style full dress uniforms, notably the ESM Saint-Cyr and the Garde Républicaine. The French Foreign Legion continued to wear their green and red epaulettes, except for a break from 1915 to 1930. In recent years, the Marine Infantry and some other units have readopted their traditional fringed epaulettes in various colours for ceremonial parades. The Marine nationale and the Armée de l'Air do not use epaulettes, but non-commissioned and commissioned officers wear a gilded shoulder strap called attente, which original function was to clip the epaulette onto the shoulder. The attentes are also worn by Army generals on dress uniform.|$|E
5000|$|The {{look of the}} President's Dining Room {{was defined}} by its {{wallpaper}}. The wallpaper was a 1960 reproduction of paper printed by Zuber et Cie in France {{some time in the}} early to mid 1800s. It was discovered in a London antique shop by Kennedy friend and socialite Brooke Astor. Known as [...] "Scenes of Revolutionary America", the wallpaper depicts various events in the American Revolutionary War. The wallpaper is based on an 1834 wallpaper printed by Zuber, [...] "Scenic America", which depicted various American landscapes and which Kennedy had hung in the Diplomatic Reception Room. ("Scenic America", in turn was derived from engravings made by Engelmann in the 1820s.) To match the colors of the wallpaper, window draperies of blue and green silk damask were hung in the room. Their design was a copy of an early 1800s design found in a book. These were topped by window treatments of green silk with gold <b>bullion</b> <b>fringe.</b> A Hereke rug from Turkey, in a similar color style, covered the floor. A mantel made of plaster mixed with other materials, installed over the fireplace in the east wall in 1952, was retained. Designed about 1815 by Robert Welford in Philadelphia, the mantel is inscribed with Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's famous message, issued after the Battle of Lake Erie in 1813: [...] "We have met the enemy, and they are ours". The room was lit with an Empire style chandelier, manufactured in the 1700s by Waterford Crystal and purchased in London by banker and art collector Chester Dale. It was given to the White House in 1948.|$|E
