5000|$|Alexander Johnston Warden, in his 1884 work Angus or Forfarshire, the Land and its People, Descriptive and Historical, quotes Reverend James Headrick {{from his}} 1813 work Review of the Agriculture of Angus, who says of Craigie House [...] "The {{plantations}} are so artificially disposed as to hide all {{those parts of}} the Tay where the tide leaves the <b>bottom</b> <b>dry,</b> and to give it all the effect of an artificial lake. The constant play of the boats and shipping, seen through these openings, gives them all the effect of figures in the magic lantern." [...] Warden goes on to comment that the view from Craigie House is [...] "extremely beautiful," [...] with Craigie House surrounded by thriving plantations, clumps of trees, and much well-grown timber. The house is described by Warden as a good, comfortable dwelling despite not being in the modern style.|$|R

40|$|Coal is {{a crucial}} {{feedstock}} for South Africa’s unique synfuels and petrochemicals industry and it is used by Sasol as a feedstock to produce synthesis gas (CO and H 2) via the Sasol-Lurgi fixed bed <b>dry</b> <b>bottom</b> gasification process. A detailed knowledge of coal characteristics is essential to predict gasification behavior when a specific coal source is to be gasified. The principle aim {{of this paper is}} to highlight and discuss those specific coal characteristics, which affect gasification behavior and stability. In order to determine the suitability of a coal source for gasification purposes, the coal is characterized and the results compared with historical data. Benchmark data, obtained when the gasifiers are operating without problems and with relatively high stability, is used as a reference. Coal from sources with extreme properties (e. g. ash content < 10 % to as high as 35 % or “brown coal ” with moisture content of approximately 30 %) can be gasified in a Sasol-Lurgi fixed bed <b>dry</b> <b>bottom</b> gasifier provided that certain operational changes are implemented. Other properties, like high caking propensity for example, require blending to acceptable levels and /or mechanical modifications. The coal characteristics discussed in this paper are not the only properties affecting gasifier stability, but are those properties which are easily measurable on laboratory scale and can be related to gasifier performance. Interpretation of coal characterization data gives an indication of expected gasifier performance, and the suitability of a specific coal source for Sasol/Lurgi Fixed Bed Gasification. Data on a number of coal sources will be discussed. Keywords: Sasol-Lurgi fixed bed <b>dry</b> <b>bottom</b> gasification, coal characteristics, South African coal sources, other feedstocks. 1...|$|R

30|$|The crater <b>bottom</b> is <b>dry</b> {{during the}} eruptive period. A {{hydrothermal}} system, however, is suggested {{to be located}} at shallow depth surrounding the eruption vent based on observations of salt fallouts during ash eruptions (Shinohara et al. 2018). Fallout of hollow salt shells was observed during and shortly after ash eruptions in 2015. The chemical composition of the salt shells {{was similar to the}} salts formed by the drying of the crater lake water. The hollow structure of the shells suggests that they were formed by the heating of hydrothermal solution droplets suspended by a stream of the plume. The salt shells suggest the existence of a hydrothermal system beneath the crater floor, even during the course of magmatic eruptions.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Corn stover {{mass and}} {{moisture}} properties were identified to aid decisions regarding collection of standing corn stover dry matter with least moisture, and to aid development of moisture prediction tools for applications including harvest, transport, size reduction, and storage. Vertical distributions of mass and moisture in standing stalks and aboveground components such as leaf, husk, and ear in standing corn plants were evaluated over time. Stalks were cut into 254 mm long sections to facilitate analysis, and {{to correspond with}} billet length collected for cane-type crops. Stalks had the greatest wet mass (72. 6 %) followed by leaf (20. 7 %) and husk (6. 8 %) during the normal harvest period. Moisture profile in aboveground plant components exhibited two separate, sequential linear relationships when plotted with time. The first zone was rapid moisture reduction prior to the normal harvest period. The second zone, corresponding with but {{not the result of}} grain harvest, had slow, gradual moisture reduction and stabilization. Geometrical analyses of stalk cross-sectional area, volume, and lateral surface area to volume ratio documented physical properties for future moisture prediction tools. Considering stalks only, the bottom 1 to 4 stalk sections had 60. 6 % of total dry matter, although that was the last portion of the stalk to dry, thereby increasing the liability of added moisture on transportation and storage. An apparent drying front moved downward through the plant over time and may be explained by reduced the lateral surface area to volume ratio from stalk top to stalk <b>bottom.</b> <b>Dry</b> matter and moisture content of stalks were not significantly influenced by the observed soil and environmental parameters, including rainfall. It was hypothesized that standing stalks readily shed rainfall and allowed less opportunit...|$|R
50|$|Haematococcus pluvialis is a {{freshwater}} {{species of}} Chlorophyta {{from the family}} Haematococcaceae. This species {{is well known for}} its high content of the strong antioxidant astaxanthin, which is important in aquaculture, and cosmetics. The high amount of astaxanthin is present in the resting cells, which are produced and rapidly accumulated when the environmental conditions become unfavorable for normal cell growth. Examples of such conditions include bright light, high salinity, and low availability of nutrients. Haematococcus pluvialis is usually found in temperate regions around the world. Their resting cysts are often responsible for the blood-red colour seen in the <b>bottom</b> of <b>dried</b> out rock pools and bird baths. This colour is caused by astaxanthin which is believed to protect the resting cysts from the detrimental effect of UV-radiation, when exposed to direct sunlight.|$|R
