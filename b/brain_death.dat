5|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>death</b> {{refers to}} an {{irreversible}} total loss of brain function. This is characterised by coma, loss of reflexes, and apnoea, however, the declaration of <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> varies geographically and is not always accepted. In some countries {{there is also a}} defined syndrome of brainstem death. Declaration of <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> can have profound implications as the declaration, under the principle of medical futility, will be associated with the withdrawal of life support, and as those with <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> often have organs suitable for organ donation. The process is often made more difficult by poor communication with patients' families.|$|E
5|$|When <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> is suspected, {{reversible}} differential diagnoses such as hypothermia-induced coma, electrolyte, neurological and drug-related cognitive suppression {{need to be}} excluded. Testing for reflexes can be of help in the decision, as can {{the absence}} of response and breathing.

40|$|Abstract Background Despite its {{clinical}} importance, {{a dearth}} of information exists on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underpin <b>brain</b> stem <b>death.</b> A suitable neural substrate for mechanistic delineation on <b>brain</b> stem <b>death</b> resides in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) {{because it is the}} origin of a life-and-death signal that sequentially increases (pro-life) and decreases (pro-death) to reflect the advancing central cardiovascular regulatory dysfunction during the progression towards <b>brain</b> stem <b>death</b> in critically ill patients. The present study evaluated the hypothesis that heme oxygnase- 1 (HO- 1) may play a pro-life role as an interposing signal between hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 (HIF- 1) and nitric oxide synthase I (NOS I) /protein kinase G (PKG) cascade in RVLM, which sustains central cardiovascular regulatory functions during <b>brain</b> stem <b>death.</b> Methods We performed cardiovascular, pharmacological, biochemical and confocal microscopy experiments in conjunction with an experimental model of <b>brain</b> stem <b>death</b> that employed microinjection of the organophosphate insecticide mevinphos (Mev; 10 nmol) bilaterally into RVLM of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Results Western blot analysis coupled with laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed that augmented HO- 1 expression that was confined to the cytoplasm of RVLM neurons occurred preferentially during the pro-life phase of experimental <b>brain</b> stem <b>death</b> and was antagonized by immunoneutralization of HIF- 1 α or HIF- 1 β in RVLM. On the other hand, the cytoplasmic presence of HO- 2 in RVLM neurons manifested insignificant changes during both phases. Furthermore, immunoneutralization of HO- 1 or knockdown of ho- 1 gene in RVLM blunted the augmented life-and-death signals exhibited during the pro-life phase. Those pretreatments also blocked the upregulated pro-life NOS I/PKG signaling without affecting the pro-death NOS II/peroxynitrite cascade in RVLM. Conclusions We conclude that transcriptional upregulation of HO- 1 on activation by HIF- 1 in RVLM plays a preferential pro-life role by sustaining central cardiovascular regulatory functions during <b>brain</b> stem <b>death</b> via upregulation of NOS I/PKG signaling pathway. Our results further showed that the pro-dead NOS II/peroxynitrite cascade in RVLM is not included in this repertoire of cellular events. </p...|$|R
5|$|In China and Tibet, mercury use {{was thought}} to prolong life, heal fractures, and {{maintain}} generally good health, although it is now known that exposure to mercury vapor leads to serious adverse health effects. The first emperor of China, Qín Shǐ Huáng Dì—allegedly buried in a tomb that contained rivers of flowing mercury on {{a model of the}} land he ruled, representative of the rivers of China—was killed by drinking a mercury and powdered jade mixture formulated by Qin alchemists (causing liver failure, mercury poisoning, and <b>brain</b> <b>death)</b> who intended to give him eternal life. Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun, the second Tulunid ruler of Egypt (r. 884–896), known for his extravagance and profligacy, reportedly built a basin filled with mercury, on which he would lie on top of air-filled cushions and be rocked to sleep.|$|E
5|$|Complications are {{distinct}} medical problems that may arise {{as a result}} of the TBI. The results of traumatic brain injury vary widely in type and duration; they include physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral complications. TBI can cause prolonged or permanent effects on consciousness, such as coma, <b>brain</b> <b>death,</b> persistent vegetative state (in which patients are unable to achieve a state of alertness to interact with their surroundings), and minimally conscious state (in which patients show minimal signs of being aware of self or environment). Lying still for long periods can cause complications including pressure sores, pneumonia or other infections, progressive multiple organ failure, and deep venous thrombosis, which can cause pulmonary embolism. Infections that can follow skull fractures and penetrating injuries include meningitis and abscesses. Complications involving the blood vessels include vasospasm, in which vessels constrict and restrict blood flow, the formation of aneurysms, in which the side of a vessel weakens and balloons out, and stroke.|$|E
5|$|Secondary injury events include {{damage to}} the blood–brain barrier, release of factors that cause inflammation, free radical overload, {{excessive}} release of the neurotransmitter glutamate (excitotoxicity), influx of calcium and sodium ions into neurons, and dysfunction of mitochondria. Injured axons in the brain's white matter may separate from their cell bodies {{as a result of}} secondary injury, potentially killing those neurons. Other factors in secondary injury are changes in the blood flow to the brain; ischemia (insufficient blood flow); cerebral hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the brain); cerebral edema (swelling of the brain); and raised intracranial pressure (the pressure within the skull). Intracranial pressure may rise due to swelling or a mass effect from a lesion, such as a hemorrhage. As a result, cerebral perfusion pressure (the pressure of blood flow in the brain) is reduced; ischemia results. When the pressure within the skull rises too high, it can cause <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> or herniation, in which parts of the brain are squeezed by structures in the skull. A particularly weak part of the skull that is vulnerable to damage causing extradural haematoma is the pterion, deep in which lies the middle meningeal artery, which is easily damaged in fractures of the pterion. Since the pterion is so weak, this type of injury can easily occur and can be secondary due to trauma {{to other parts of the}} skull where the impact forces spreads to the pterion.|$|E
40|$|Background: Spontaneous {{circulation}} {{returns to}} {{less than half of}} adult cardiac arrest victims who received in-hospital resuscitation. One clue for this disheartening outcome arises from the prognosis that asystole invariably takes place, after a time lag, on diagnosis of <b>brain</b> stem <b>death.</b> The designation of <b>brain</b> stem <b>death</b> as {{the point of no return}} further suggests that permanent impairment of the brain stem cardiovascular regulatory machinery precedes death. It follows that a crucial determinant for successful revival of an arrested heart is that spontaneous circulation must resume before <b>brain</b> stem <b>death</b> commences. Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that maintained functional integrity of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), a neural substrate that is intimately related to <b>brain</b> stem <b>death</b> and central circulatory regulation, holds the key to the vital time-window between cardiac arrest and resumption of spontaneous circulation. Methodology/Principal Findings: An animal model of <b>brain</b> stem <b>death</b> employing the pesticide mevinphos as the experimental insult in Sprague-Dawley rats was used. Intravenous administration of lethal doses of mevinphos elicited an abrupt cardiac arrest, accompanied by elevated systemic arterial pressure and anoxia, augmented neuronal excitability and enhanced microvascular perfusion in RVLM. This period represents the vital time-window between cardiac arrest and resumption of spontaneous circulation in our experimental model.

25|$|Organ donors may {{be living}} or may {{have died of}} <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> or circulatory death. Most {{deceased}} donors {{are those who have}} been pronounced brain dead. Brain dead means the cessation of brain function, typically after receiving an injury (either traumatic or pathological) to the brain, or otherwise cutting off blood circulation to the brain (drowning, suffocation, etc.). Breathing is maintained via artificial sources, which, in turn, maintains heartbeat. Once <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> has been declared the person can be considered for organ donation. Criteria for <b>brain</b> <b>death</b> vary. Because less than 3% of all deaths in the U.S. are the result of <b>brain</b> <b>death,</b> the overwhelming majority of deaths are ineligible for organ donation, resulting in severe shortages.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the phenomenon of <b>brain</b> stem <b>death</b> has continued since the first recognition in 1968. Given that all cases of <b>brain</b> stem <b>death</b> occur {{in the intensive care}} unit (White 2003), it is of paramount importance that nurses develop a sound understanding of the concept. Despite this, a degree of misunderstanding of the concept still exists amongst nurses (White 2003). Furthermore, due to the sensitivity of this phenomenon, the nurses who care for brain stem dead patients experience complex emotions, leaving them in a state of cognitive dissonance, where the stressful nature of this work conflicts with their physiological understanding of the concept (Ronayne 2009). This study aims to determine the nurses’ degree of understanding of the concept of <b>brain</b> stem <b>death,</b> gain a deeper understanding of the meaning of experiences, feelings and emotions of nurses caring for <b>brain</b> stem <b>death</b> and identify the effectiveness of the coping strategies intensive care nurses employ when faced with <b>brain</b> stem <b>death.</b> This will be a quantitative study, employing an inductive approach. Using Glaser and Strauss’ classic approach to grounded theory, a sample of seventy-eight Scottish intensive care nurses from a single unit will be invited to share their experiences of caring for a patient who is brain stem dead, in a one-to-one, unstructured interview.

50|$|The {{first step}} of organ {{procurement}} is to check the health condition of the organ. If the source is human, most countries require that the source is legally dead for organ transplantation purposes (e.g. cardiac or brain dead) or a voluntary healthy adult for the donation of some organs.

Results Results from ELISA showed that whereas the total ERK 1 / 2 was not affected, augmented phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 at Thr 202 and Tyr 204 in RVLM occurred preferentially during the pro-life phase of experimental <b>brain</b> stem <b>death.</b> Furthermore, pretreatment by microinjection into the bilateral RVLM of a specific ERK 2 inhibitor, ERK activation inhibitor peptide II (1 nmol); a specific MEK 1 / 2 inhibitor, U 0126 (5 pmol); or a specific MNK 1 / 2 inhibitor, CGP 57380 (5 pmol) exacerbated the hypotension and blunted the augmented life-and-death signals exhibited during the pro-life phase.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To audit all {{deaths in}} {{intensive}} care units (excepting coronary care only and neonatal intensive care units) in England to assess potential for organ procurement. DESIGN [...] An audit in which 14 regional health authorities and London special health authorities each designated a regional liaison officer to identify intensive care units and liaise with Department of Health and the Medical Research Council's biostatistics unit in distribution, return, and checking of audit forms. Audit took place from 1 January to 31 March 1989 {{and will continue to}} 31 December 1990. SETTING [...] 278 Intensive care units in England. PARTICIPANTS [...] Colleagues {{in intensive care}} units (doctors, nurses, coordinators, and others), who completed serially numbered audit forms for all patients who died in intensive care. RESULTS [...] The estimated number of deaths in intensive care units was 3085, and validated audit forms were received for 2853 <b>deaths</b> (92 %). <b>Brain</b> stem <b>death</b> was a possible diagnosis in only 407 (14 %) patients (about 1700 cases a year) and was confirmed in 282 (10 %) patients (an estimated 1200 cases a year). Half the patients (95 % confidence interval 45 % to 57 %) in whom <b>brain</b> stem <b>death</b> was confirmed became actual donors of solid organs. Tests for <b>brain</b> stem <b>death</b> were not performed in 106 (26 %) of 407 patients with <b>brain</b> stem <b>death</b> as a possible diagnosis, and general medical contraindication to organ donation was recorded for 48 (17 %) of 282 patients who fulfilled <b>brain</b> stem <b>death</b> criteria before cessation of heart beat. The criteria were fulfilled before cessation of heart beat {{and in the absence of}} any general medical contraindication to organ donation in 234 patients, 8 % of those dying in intensive care (an estimated 1000 cases a year). Consent for organ donation was given in 152 (70 %) of 218 cases (64 % to 76 %) when the possibility of organ donation was suggested to relatives. In only 14 out of 232 families (6 %; 3 % to 9 %) was there no discussion of organ donation with relatives. Corneal suitability was recorded as "not known" in a high proportion (1271; 45 %) of all deaths and intensive care units reported only 123 corneal donors (4 % of all audited deaths). CONCLUSION [...] When <b>brain</b> stem <b>death</b> is a possible diagnosis tests should always be carried out for confirmation. Early referral to the transplant team or coordinator should occur in all cases of <b>brain</b> stem <b>death</b> to check contraindications to organ donation. There should be increased use of asystolic kidney donation, and patients should be routinely assessed for suitability for corneal donation.
