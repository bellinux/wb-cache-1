5000|$|Oliver {{was born}} in a workhouse, and {{orphaned}} almost immediately. He is effectively the lowest form of life in England, living in a dirty house, eating meager portions of gruel, and working long days. His fate throughout the novel is largely decided by outside forces: his birthplace was chosen for him; his caretakers fed him meager portions, raised him harshly and coldly, and forced him to work from a young age; and Sowerberry, the undertaker, apprenticed him. On the way to this new position, Oliver cries, seemingly realizing that he lacks control over his life. These actions are done unto him, while he only bears the effects of them. Outside forces have shaped the path of his life to that point. If one looks at Oliver’s behavior and mannerisms, {{it can be seen that}} he is the epitome of innocence and purity. Whereas the other poor characters speak rough, common English, Oliver delivers his dialogue with speech fit for the King. This can be seen when Oliver first meets the Artful dodger:Dodger: “Hullo my covey, what’s the row?”Oliver: “I am very hungry and tired. I have walked a long way. I have been walking these seven days.” Dodger: “Walking for seven days! Oh I see. <b>Beak’s</b> <b>order,</b> eh? I suppose you don’t know what a beak is, my flash com-pan-i-on.” ...|$|R
40|$|Cephalopod beaks {{found in}} the diet of predators {{have been a major}} source of {{scientific}} information. In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of DNA and contaminants analysis (total mercury — T-Hg) in cephalopod <b>beaks</b> in <b>order</b> to assess their applicability as tools in marine ecology studies. We concluded that, when applying DNA techniques to cephalopod beaks from Antarctic squid species, when using flesh attached to those beaks, it was possible to obtain DNA and to successfully identify cephalopod species; DNA was not found on the beaks themselves. This study also showed {{that it is possible to}} obtain information on T-Hg concentrations in beaks: the T-Hg concentrations {{found in the}} beaks were 6 to 46 times lower than in the flesh of the same cephalopod species. More research on the relationships of mercury concentrations in cephalopod beaks (and other tissues), intra- and inter-specifically, are needed in the future...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} anatomy of a Miocene whale fossil found in Kenya to that of modern and other fossil <b>beaked</b> whales in <b>order</b> to {{identify}} it using phylogenetic analysis. The specimen is a partial skull and lacks diagnostic features present in the posterior regions of the skull, but a parsimony analysis based on available characters determined the whale is likely linked to modern Mesoplodon and Hyperoodon. Identification of this specimen is necessary for biogeographical purposes and other investigations using the fossil as a marker for the paleocoastline. Furthermore, this whale is an important and unique tool {{that can be used}} to study the development of the East African Rift...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBird {{pollination}} {{has evolved}} repeatedly among flowering plants but is almost exclusively characterized by passive transfer of pollen onto {{the bird and}} by nectar as primary reward [1, 2]. Food body rewards are exceedingly rare among eudicot flowering plants and are only known to occur on sterile floral organs [3]. In this study, we report an alternative bird pollination mechanism involving bulbous stamen appendages in the Neotropical genus Axinaea (Melastomataceae). We studied the pollination process by combining pollination experiments, video monitoring, and detailed analyses of stamen structure and metabolomic composition. We show that the bulbous stamen appendages, which are consumed by various species of passerines (Thraupidae, Fringillidae), are bifunctional during the pollination process. First, the appendages work as bellows organs in a unique pollen expulsion mechanism activated by the passerines. As the birds seize an appendage with their <b>beaks</b> in <b>order</b> to remove it from the flower for consumption, air contained in the appendage’s aerenchymatous tissue is pressed into the hollow anther. The resulting air flow causes the expulsion of a pollen jet and the deposition of pollen on the bird’s head and beak. Second, the stamen appendages provide a hexose-rich, highly nutritious (15, 100 J/g) food body reward for the pollinating passerines. This discovery expands our knowledge of flowering plant pollination systems and provides the first report of highly specialized bellows organs for active pollen transfer in flowering plants. In addition, {{this is the only}} known case of a food body reward associated with reproductive structures in the eudicot clade of flowering plants. PaperFlic...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 From the {{stiffness}} span of squid beaks to the toughness of seashells and the hardness of chiton teeth, natural biological materials {{have a broad}} range of exceptional mechanical properties. Tanning induced protein cross-linking dictates the transition from the stiff rostrum to the compliant wing of a squid <b>beak.</b> A highly <b>ordered</b> microstructural organization of chitin nanofiber network embedded within a protein matrix facilitates the toughness of seashells. Nano-crystalline magnetite minerals embedded within chitin nanofiber network gives the ultra hardness of chiton tooth. Inspired by these biological strategies for improved mechanical properties, my Ph. D. research has been focusing on engineering chitin and chitosan based composites with improved mechanical properties from chemistry, microstructure and mineralization. Projects include a squid beak mimics with stiffness span dictated by the degree of cross-linking, methods to control chitin-silk molecular morphology including an electric-field assisted gelation method and a water vapor annealing method as well as a proof-of-concept chitin-GelMA hydrogel for tissue engineering applications, and using banana slug radula as a model to explore correlations from teeth morphology, chemical composition and mineralization, to mechanical behavior and functionalities...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of suitable habitat and hotspot areas for cetaceans are increasingly urgent to inform decision makers on spatial management plans and to tackle anthropogenic threats and global changes. Little or no survey {{effort has been}} carried out so far in offshore waters of the Canary Basin (NE Atlantic Ocean) where most of protected areas are coastal or islands areas. As a consequence, {{there is a lack of}} data on distribution of many sensitive pelagic species. This is particularly the case of <b>beaked</b> whales. In <b>order</b> to fill this gap, 48 sea-surveys along fixed transects between Continental Portugal and Madeira Island were performed in 2012 and 2013, from July to October. We used GAMs to identify the role of environmental variables in shaping cetacean distribution. Then we built an Environmental Envelope model to map and predict species hotspots in the region. Results show the richness of offshore waters: in a total of 10636 nm sampled, we recorded 234 sightings accounting for at least 9 cetacean species. GAM results highlight the importance of seamounts for all species, though habitat segregation occurs among groups. We recorded 28 sightings of beaked whales, all within a distance of 40 nm from the base of the seamounts. Moreover, beaked whales were always sighted further than 55 nm from the coast and 50 % of the sightings were between 180 nm to 240 nm from the coast, with a median depth of about 4300 m, proving the importance of sampling offshore waters. Maps produced by the Environmental Envelop model highlight that hotspots for beaked whales were also described by dynamic variables, in particular by the presence of productive mesoscale eddies. Considering ACCOBAMS priorities and EEZ extension for the area, and the urgent need for management plans, we suggest maintaining these sea-surveys to improve habitat modelling and cetacean occurrence prediction...|$|R
40|$|Bill and claw {{morphological}} {{characteristics were}} measured {{to establish the}} extent of functional similarities in the hunting and feeding apparatus among Southern African birds of prey (orders Falconiformes and Strigiformes) sharing the same prey type. MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance) was used to indicate the significance of differences at prey category level among the species. Studentâ€™s T {{test was used to}} assess for significant differences between sexes in their bill and claw morphological characteristics. Regression analysis indicated significant relationships between the morphological characteristics in birds of prey. In both the Falconiformes and Strigiformes orders significant differences were observed among the prey categories in the entire three claw morphological characteristics measured (claw shape, total claw length and hind claw length). In both orders all species except for carrion feeders showed significant variation in claw lengths with increase in mean body mass and wing length. Claws of carrion feeders were the least curved and shortest relative to their body masses and wing lengths among the raptors. In both <b>orders,</b> <b>beak</b> sizes and shapes showed some overlap among the prey categories. No significant differences were observed in bill shapes and bill volumes among the prey categories of both orders. However, in both orders the prey categories showed significant differences in bill lengths and culmen lengths. Except in carrion feeders, culmen length varied significantly with increase in mean body mass and wing length in all prey categories of both orders. Reversed sexual size dimorphism was also observed in the bill and claw sizes in most species in the two orders. However, no significant differences in the hind claw shape and bill shape were observed between sexes in most species of both orders. Degree of sexual size dimorphism varied among the species. In most species the females had larger hunting and feeding appendages compared to their male counterparts. In the order Falconiformes the genus Accipiter comprising mainly of bird feeders was the most dimorphic. In the order Strigiformes insect and other arthropod feeders were the most dimorphic...|$|R
40|$|Cephalopods play a {{key role}} in the marine {{environment}} but knowledge of their feeding habits is limited by lack of data. Here, we have developed a new tool to investigate their feeding ecology by combining the use of their predators as biological samplers together with measurements of the stable isotopic signature of their beaks. Cephalopod beaks are chitinous hard structures that resist digestion and the stable isotope ratios of carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) are indicators of the foraging areas and trophic levels of consumers, respectively. First, a comparison of δ 13 C and δ 15 N values of different tissues from the same individuals showed that beaks were slightly enriched in 13 C but highly impoverished in 15 N compared with lipid-free muscle tissues. Second, beaks from the same species showed a progressive increase in their δ 15 N values with increasing size, which is in agreement with a dietary shift from lower to higher trophic levels during cephalopod growth. In the same way, there was an increase in the δ 15 N signature of various parts of the same lower <b>beaks</b> in the <b>order</b> rostrum, lateral walls and wings, which reflects the progressive growth and chitinization of the beaks in parallel with dietary changes. Third, we investigated the trophic structure of a cephalopod community for the first time. Values of δ 15 N indicate that cephalopods living in slope waters of the subantarctic Kerguelen Islands (n= 18 species) encompass almost three distinct trophic levels, with a continuum of two levels between crustacean- and fish-eaters and a distinct higher trophic level occupied by the colossal squid Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni. δ 13 C values demonstrated that cephalopods grow in three different marine ecosystems, with 16 species living and developing in Kerguelen waters and two species migrating from either Antarctica (Slosarczykovia circumantarctica) or the subtropics (the giant squid Architeuthis dux). The stable isotopic signature of beaks accumulated in predators' stomachs therefore revealed new trophic relationships and migration patterns and is a powerful tool to investigate the role of the poorly known cephalopods in the marine environment...|$|R
