Deakin was the first PM to call an early election, within two months of becoming the leader, to catch his opponents off guard and take advantage of a large number of urban educated female voters who could cast a ballot for the first time. In April 1904, he resigned without passing any legislation. The Labor leader Chris Watson and the Free Trade leader George Reid succeeded him, but neither could form a stable ministry.|$|E

The first American marsupials were Stephen Girard, Mr. Astor and the opossum; the principal marsupials of the Southern Hemisphere are Mr. Rhodes, and the kangaroo. I, myself, am the latest marsupial. Also, I might boast that I have the largest pocket of them all. But there is nothing in that.]--one, the [...] "Tasmanian devil;" [...] that is, I think he was one of them. And there was a fish with lungs. When the water dries up it can live in the mud. Most curious of all was a parrot that kills sheep. On one great sheep-run this bird killed a thousand sheep in a whole year. He doesn't want the whole sheep, but only the kidney-fat. This restricted taste makes him an expensive bird to support. To get the fat he drives his beak in and rips it out; the wound is mortal. This parrot furnishes a notable example of evolution brought about by changed conditions. When the sheep culture was introduced, it presently brought famine to the parrot by exterminating a kind of grub which had always thitherto been the parrot's diet. The miseries of hunger made the bird willing to eat raw flesh, since it could get no other food, and it began to pick remnants of meat from sheep skins hung out on the fences to dry. It soon came to prefer sheep meat to any other food, and by and by it came to prefer the kidney-fat to any other detail of the sheep. The parrot's bill was not well shaped for digging out the fat, but Nature fixed that matter; she altered the bill's shape, and now the parrot can dig out kidney-fat better than the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, or anybody else, for that matter--even an Admiral.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Boron {{that appears}} in borate form in nature is an {{essential}} additive {{to a variety of}} industrial products. Recently, certain boron compounds have attracted attention in high technology utilization areas owing to their special crystal and optical characteristics. Thermoluminescent (TL) dosimetry that is used to record amount of radiation exposure is one of such areas. Two borates searched for candidacy in TL dosimetry are lithium tetraborate and lithium triborate. These materials are synthesized and metal doped by numerous researchers to be tested for thermoluminescence response. Lithium tetraborate has aroused interest of scientists since 1960 s <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtesy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermoluminescence (TL) property. However, lithium triborate is rather new in this area. This study compromises a broad overview including synthesis methods employed for <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> these two materials. Furthermore, the TL properties that have significant effect on the TL dosimetry potential of a compound are noted along with the detailed information on TL measurement procedure specifications...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> enigmatic nature <b>of</b> Mallarmé’s works disconcerted {{his first}} readers {{and they were}} {{published}} at a period when <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> newspaper and periodicals was rapidly increasing.
