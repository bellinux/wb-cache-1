50|$|Grenz {{rays are}} part of the {{electromagnetic}} spectrum comprising low energy (ultrasoft) X-rays. These were first investigated by Gustav Bucky in 1923 using a cathode vacuum tube with a lithium borate glass window, which he labeled Grenz rays as he believed that the biological effects resembled those of UV light and traditional X-rays and hence were on the border between the two (Grenz = border in German). These rays are also known as <b>Bucky</b> <b>rays.</b>|$|E
