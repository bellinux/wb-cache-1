The study utilizes a self-administrated survey on a sample of 380 individuals created {{in order to understand}} the influence of the Internet on consumer buying behavior. The survey was administrated in Portugal, one of the European countries that are still struggling with Internet penetration. Results show the importance of the Internet has on two stages of the buying process: (i) alternative evaluation and (ii) <b>buying</b> <b>act.</b> Furthermore, this research highlights the critical role of touristic products availability and search costs on the buying behavior of consumers. However, past bad experiences and a certain level of insecurity persist as factors limiting the online purchase process. Results confirm the general trends in consumer behavior and highlight the need of moving further for Portugal in terms of technology adoption...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Congress has broad {{authority}} to place {{conditions on the}} purchases made {{by the federal government}} or with federal dollars. One of many conditions that it has placed on direct government purchases is a requirement that they be produced in the United States. The most familiar of these requirements is known as the <b>Buy</b> American <b>Act,</b> which is the major domestic preference statute governing procurement by the federal government. The <b>Buy</b> American <b>Act</b> applies to direct purchases by the federal government of more than $ 3, 000, providing the purchase is consistent with the public interest, the items or services are reasonable in cost, and they are for use in the United States. The act requires that “substantially all” of the acquisition be attributable to American-made components. Regulations have interpreted this requirement to mean that at least 50 % of the cost must be attributable to American content. While the act has only been substantively amended four times since its enactment in 1933, every Congress in the intervening years has seen fit to enact some form of additional domestic preference legislation. This legislation has been generally directed at purchases that for some reason were not governed by the <b>Buy</b> American <b>Act</b> and often took the form of temporary law that was enacted Congress after Congress, often as an appropriations rider to deny the use of funds to purchase goods that were not of domestic origin. While this approach has not been abandoned, the current trend appears to be to codify these “Little Buy American Acts” as permanent law. This report summarizes (1) the <b>Buy</b> American <b>Act,</b> what it does and does not cover; (2) the Little <b>Buy</b> American <b>Acts</b> found in permanent law, emphasizing what they govern, major exceptions, and why Congress felt them necessary in light of the requirements of the Buy American Act; and (3) the temporary Little Buy American provision found in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. This thesis explores {{the costs and}} benefits of the <b>Buy</b> American <b>Act</b> (BAA). The BAA requires a domestic preference for all Federal Government purchases. The thesis uses accepted economic analysis on the gains from international trade to show that the costs of maintaining such protectionist legislation are potentially high relative to the uncertain benefits of maintaining excess industrial surge capacity. Moreover, surge capacity did not appear to be an issue in the debate over passage of the BAA in 1933. Passed at the trough of the depression, the Act appears to have been motivated by the mistaken belief that it would on net save U. S. jobs. In light of the declining real procurement budget for the Department of Defense, a relaxation of the BAA seems called for. This thesis concludes by recommending that the scope of the <b>Buy</b> American <b>Act</b> be narrowed[URL] United States Arm...|$|R

Reviewing the background and implementation of the Act will give both industry and government managers guidance on how to proceed under its restrictions. The <b>Buy</b> American <b>Act</b> has been a staple of federal acquisition since its codification on March 3, 1933. Its express purpose is to provide a preferen-tial treatment for domestic sources of un-manufactured articles, manufactured goods, and construction materials. The Act is of concern to the program manager be-cause of its complicated nature, the re-quirement for certification of compliance by defense contractors, and its continued existence in an era of acquisition reform.
