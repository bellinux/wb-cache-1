5000|$|In panel 2 of the diagram, {{the cell}} {{membrane}} {{has been made}} permeable to potassium ions, but not the anions (An−) inside the cell. These anions are mostly contributed by protein. There is energy stored in the potassium ion concentration gradient that can be converted into an electrical gradient when potassium (K+) ions {{move out of the}} cell. Note that potassium ions can move across the membrane in both directions but by the purely statistical process that arises from the higher concentration of potassium ions inside the cell, there will be more potassium ions moving out of the cell. Because there is a higher concentration of potassium ions inside the cells, their random molecular motion is more likely to encounter the permeability pore (ion channel) than is the case for the potassium ions that are outside and at a lower concentration. An internal K+ is simply [...] "more likely" [...] to leave the cell than an extracellular K+ is to enter it. It is a matter of simple diffusion doing work by dissipating the concentration gradient. As potassium leaves the cell, it is leaving behind the anions. Therefore, a charge separation is developing as K+ leaves the cell. This charge separation creates a transmembrane voltage. This transmembrane voltage is the membrane potential. As potassium continues to leave the cell, separating more charges, the membrane potential will continue to grow. The length of the arrows (green indicating concentration gradient, red indicating voltage), represents the magnitude of potassium ion movement due to each form of energy. The direction of the arrow indicates the direction in which that particular force is applied. Thus, the <b>building</b> <b>membrane</b> voltage is an increasing force that acts counter to the tendency for net movement of potassium ions down the potassium concentration gradient.|$|E

Nevertheless, the envelope integrates within the building and this improvement on the insulation performance has to be properly adopted, {{taking into account the}} interrelation of main elements composing the overall system (facade, frame, slabs, openings, partitions etc.), as well as side effects originated not only for new erected buildings, but specifically in renovation and retrofitting works. This paper describes real experiences when considering various options for upgrading the facade through the increase of the insulation capacity, starting from external overcladding prefabricated panels and ventilated facades, advancing to more sustainable low carbon systems and ending with even more highly insulated solutions employing aerogels. Lessons from these cases, where energy and hygrothermal assessments have being carried out, demonstrate the influence of the design and construction phases and the relevance of disregarded effects such as minor thermal bridges, uncontrolled craftsmanship on site, and moisture transfer for the different technologies considered.

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on a {{comparative}} analysis of some twenty-six intelligent building facades and sixteen large media-facades from a socio-psychological perspective. It is not difficult to observe how deployment of computational technologies have engendered new possibilities for architectural production to which surface-centeredness lies at that heart of spatial production during design, fabrication and envelope automation processes. While surfaces {{play a critical role in}} contemporary social production (information display, communication and interaction), it is important to understand how the relationships between augmented building surfaces and its subjects unfold. We target double-skin automated facades as a distinct field within building-services and automation industry, and discuss how the developments within this area are over-occupied with seamless climate control and energy efficiency themes, resulting into socially inert mechanical membranes. Our thesis is that at the core of the development of automated façade lies the industrial automation attitude that renders the eventual product socially less engaging and machinic. We illustrate examples of interactive media-façades to demonstrate how architects and interaction designers have used similar technology to turn building surfaces into socially engaging architectural elements. We seek opportunities to extend performative aspects of otherwise function driven double-skin façades for public expression, informal social engagement and context embodiment. Towards the end of the paper, we propose a conceptual model as a possible method to address the emergent issues.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} research {{carried out}} to monitor the behaviour of membrane structures, using the non-contact geornatics techniques of terrestrial laser scanning and videogrammetry. Membrane structures are covers or enclosures in which fabric surface is pre-tensioned to provide a stable shape under environmental loads. It is most often adopted by structural engineers as {{the solution to the}} roof of a <b>building.</b> <b>Membrane</b> structures resist extemally-imposed loads by a combination of curvature and tension of the highly flexible fabric membrane. However, collapse may occur if the real deflections exceed the designed tolerances. In order to avoid such failures in the future, a generic monitoring system, incorporating in-house software for observing and analysing the behaviour of existing membrane structures, was developed. This system has been applied to observe three different types of as-built membrane structures, with two primary issues investigated and resolved. The first aspect of the research was devoted to determining differences which exist between the designed model and the finished structure. To address this issue, terrestrial laser scanning was applied to generate the as-built model of the membrane structure. Statistical comparisons were then performed between the resultant scanned model and the designed mathematical model. The disparities were determined, allowing the factors causing these differences to be further explored. The second research issue investigated the effects of loading on the displacement of the membrane roof. A videogrammetric monitoring system employing stereo CCD video cameras was used to observe the movements of the membrane roofs. In order to accommodate constraints at the test site, a non-contact control method and structured light targeting were adopted in the monitoring scheme. Once the processing was completed, displacements occurring over time were determined. Investigations on the three types of finished membrane structures have been successfully achieved, proving the system to be a viable metrology tool for structural engineers involved in monitoring real-world membrane structures. The system effectively fulfilled the requirements for understanding the interaction of membrane surface geometry, applied loads and structural response. The information acquired by the system offers great potential to collaborating engineers who are involved in the design and refinement of such structures.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{development}} of a facile phase-inversion method for forming asymmetric membranes with a precise high metal ion loading capacity in only the dense layer. The approach combines the use of macromolecule-metal intermolecular complexes to form the dense layer of asymmetric membranes with nonsolvent-induced phase separation to form the porous support. This allows the independent optimization of both the dense layer and porous support while maintaining the simplicity of a phase-inversion process. Moreover, it facilitates control over (i) the thickness of the dense layer throughout several orders of magnitude—from less than 15 nm to more than 6 μm, (ii) the type and amount of metal ions loaded in the dense layer, (iii) the morphology of the membrane surface, and (iv) the porosity and structure of the support.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} several {{contributions to}} the problem of <b>building</b> large-scale <b>membrane</b> filtration water treatment plants needed to meet increasingly stringent drinking water standards. The first contribution is an extension of a small-scale model of membrane filtration water treatment plants to a model that determines building specifications for the needed large-scale plants at a minimum cost. The large-scale model allows choosing a mix of feed and backflush pumps and partitioning the membrane area into more than one array in order to capture design decisions that can greatly reduce the cost. However, these additions to the model change the mathematical formulation from a small nonconvex nonlinear programming problem (NLP) to a large nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP), which is much more difficult to solve. To address the difficulties associated with solving general nonconvex MINLPs, the second contribution is the development of an algorithm that exploits the structure of the nonconvex MINLP problem and the code written to implement the algorithm. The special structure of our nonconvex MINLP allows the development of a specific algorithm that exploits the structure and allows many benefits over existing methods. The algorithm guarantees termination to local optimizer for the MINLP, requires the solution of a small NLP and a relatively small IP compared to most algorithms that require the solution of a large NLP and a large MILP, requires the solution of an IP instead of an MILP, and requires very few iterations for termination. The MINLP is reformulated so that the algorithm needs only to iteratively solve alternations of an NLP and an integer programming problem (IP). Finally, we establish design guidelines for <b>building</b> large-scale <b>membrane</b> filtration water treatment plants. These guidelines include suggestions on how to choose an appropriate mix of feed and backflush pumps, how to partition the membrane area for different size plants, and how to estimate costs. Specifically, we show that larger plants can be operated more cost efficiently than smaller plants at higher recoveries and that a more flexible consideration of facility configuration and pump selection may reduce costs for larger plants by approximately 20 % per year...|$|R

As an innovative technology, Pd-Ag thin wall membranes are proposed for <b>building</b> <b>membrane</b> reactors: accordingly, the energy efficiency analysis of the processes producing hydrogen from the ethanol {{steam reforming}} has been carried out and, particularly, the comparison among a traditional process and different membrane processes is reported. The traditional process studied consists of an ethanol reformer followed by two water gas shift reactors operating at high and low temperature, respectively: the final hydrogen purification is carried out by a preferential oxidizer {{in order to reduce the}} CO concentration below 10 ppm before feeding the PEM fuel cell. Then two membrane processes using Pd-Ag tubes and operating with a feed H 2 O/ethanol have been considered. The first one uses a traditional ethanol reformer and a Pd-Ag membrane reactor where the water gas shift reaction and the hydrogen separation take simultaneously place: the pure hydrogen recovered in the permeate side of the membrane reactor is sent to the PEM anode. In the second membrane process, one Pd-Ag membrane reactor performs both the ethanol steam reforming and the hydrogen separation: also in this case, the pure hydrogen recovered in the permeate side of the membrane reactor is directly sent to the PEM anode. The analysis showed that the highest values of the energy efficiency have been attained by the process using one membrane reformer: this process has a net electric efficiency higher than the traditional one by 10 %. Finally, an efficiency field-to-wheel analysis has been also carried out: a conventional application of the pure bio-ethanol in a reciprocating engine has been compared to a membrane system processing humid bio-ethanol and fuelling a PEM driven electrical engine. As a result, the membrane process presents a higher energy efficiency up to 50 % and mainly as a consequence of the direct use of water-ethanol mixtures: in fact, in this case the distillation and dehydration of the bio-ethanol is avoided thus increasing the energy efficiency...|$|E

[1, 2] Yet two-thirds of the cellular proteome operates at a membrane surface or within a membrane comprising thousands of different lipid species. Besides serving as essential <b>building</b> blocks of <b>membranes</b> and anhydrous stores of energy, lipids participate in a multitude of signaling pathways. Perturbations in lipid homeostasis frequently result in human diseases, ranging from neurodegenerative disorders to metabolic syndrome and cancer. [3, 4] While these findings imply an intricate interplay between proteins and lipids, only a few studies have been carried out to chart protein–lipid interactions in a systematic fashion...|$|R
40|$|In {{desalination}} often multi ionic compositions are encountered. A preferential {{removal of}} multivalent ions over monovalent ions {{can be of}} interest to prevent scaling in the desalination process. Recently, a novel fractionating electrodialysis stack is described by Zhang et al., 2012 (in Sep. purify. Technol. 88). In the present work a small modification to such a stack was made, to create a current induced ion exchange process, in which no longer desalination occurs. This was done by <b>building</b> a <b>membrane</b> stack in which monovalent-selective ion-exchange membranes and standard grade ion-exchange membranes, with similar charge sign (so either anion or cation exchange groups), were placed alternatingly between an anode and a cathode to form a membrane stack. A proof of principle of the fractioning electrodialysis technology is given. Ternary mixtures, with a divalent-monovalent ion ratio similar to seawater, were used as feed water. For a cation and an anion fractioning stack, maximum fractionations of divalent ions were obtained of approximately 90 and 60 %. At higher applied current density, ions can be fractionated to a larger extent than at lower applied current density. For both stacks the water recovery was 50 %. Coulombic efficiency of both processes decrease rapidly after the start of the experiment. This leads to relatively large volumetric energy consumptions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
