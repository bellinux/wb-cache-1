5000|$|<b>Battleships</b> {{had been}} internationally {{perceived}} as the strategic arms race focus since the Washington Naval Conference of 1921. Countries unable to match the numbers of <b>battleships</b> maintained by the United States and the United Kingdom had built faster <b>battleships</b> so they might {{have the option of}} evading stronger fleets. Italy modernized Conte di Cavour and Giulio Cesare in 1937 with new engines increasing their speed to 28 knots. Germany completed the 31-knot <b>battleships</b> Gneisenau in 1938 and Scharnhorst in January 1939. For the first ten months of World War II, the Dunkerque-class <b>battleships</b> of Force de Raid were the only modern Allied <b>battleships</b> available to counter the Scharnhorst-class <b>battleships.</b> The old Royal Navy battle cruisers , , and [...] had similar speed, but their horizontal deck armor offered inadequate protection against aerial bombs and the plunging trajectory of long-range gunfire.|$|R

5|$|A <b>battleship</b> {{is a large}} armored warship with a {{main battery}} {{consisting}} of large caliber guns.

5|$|Agamemnons first {{target service}} took place before her {{modifications}} were completed. On 19 March 1921, she {{was exposed to}} a cloud of poisonous gas {{to determine the effect}} of gas on a <b>battleship.</b> It was found that gas could penetrate the ship via her various openings, but the ship had not been sealed against gas before the trial and no accurate results applicable to a commissioned <b>battleship</b> could be obtained. On 21 September, she was subjected to machine-gun fire by strafing aircraft. These trials showed that such strafing could harass a <b>battleship,</b> but could not impair her fighting or steaming capabilities, and helped to determine protection for bridge personnel.|$|E

5|$|Aki was {{refitting}} at Kure and Satsuma {{was assigned}} to the 1st <b>Battleship</b> Squadron when World War I began in August 1914. The latter served as Rear Admiral Tatsuo Matsumura's flagship in the Second South Seas Squadron as it seized the German possessions of the Caroline and the Palau Islands in October 1914. Satsuma rejoined the 1st <b>Battleship</b> Squadron in 1915, was refitted at Sasebo Naval Arsenal in 1916 and served with the 1st Squadron {{for the rest of the}} war. Aki was also assigned to the 1st Squadron upon the completion of her refit and remained with it until she was transferred to the 2nd <b>Battleship</b> Squadron in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>Battleship</b> Division Nine's {{service was}} limited mainly to convoy duty and the {{maintenance}} of the blockade of the German coast, its presence greatly augmented the strength of the Grand Fleet, thus making major combat between the British and German fleets even more unlikely in 1918. By helping to keep the High Seas Fleet effectively blockaded in port, <b>Battleship</b> Division Nine played a role in ensuring Allied control of the oceans.|$|E
5|$|Among the world's {{remaining}} battleships, Texas {{is notable}} {{for being the}} only remaining World War I–era dreadnought <b>battleship,</b> though she is not the oldest surviving battleship: , a pre-dreadnought <b>battleship</b> ordered in 1898 by the Imperial Japanese Navy and HMS Victory, Nelson's flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar, are both older than Texas.

5000|$|The Yamato-class <b>battleships</b> (Yamato-gata senkan) were <b>battleships</b> of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) {{constructed}} and operated during World War II. Displacing 72000 LT at full load, the vessels were the heaviest <b>battleships</b> ever constructed. The class carried the largest naval artillery ever fitted to a warship, nine 460-millimetre (18.1 in) naval guns, each capable of firing 1460 kg shells over 42 km.

5000|$|However, Pearl Harbor did {{not have}} as {{crippling}} an effect on American operations as initially thought. Unlike the close confines of the Mediterranean, the vast expanses of the Pacific limited the tactical value of <b>battleships</b> as a fleet in being. Furthermore, unlike new fast <b>battleships</b> such as the , the slow <b>battleships</b> were incapable of operating with carrier task forces, so once repaired they were relegated to delivering pre-invasion bombardments during the island hopping offensive against Japanese-held islands. These Pearl Harbor veterans were later part of a force that defeated IJN <b>battleships</b> at the Battle of Surigao Strait, an engagement very lopsided in the USN's favor in any case. A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was {{a belief that the}} ultimate Pacific battle would be between <b>battleships</b> of both sides, in keeping with the doctrine of Captain Alfred Mahan. Seeing the decimation of <b>battleships</b> at the hands of aircraft, Yamamoto (and his successors) hoarded his <b>battleships</b> for a [...] "decisive battle" [...] that never happened, only committing a handful to the forefront of the Battles of Midway and Guadalcanal.|$|R
