50|$|In construction, {{provision}} {{was made on}} site for a fourth generating unit (to {{the north of the}} existing units), including a fourth stack inside the chimney, but the fourth generating unit was cancelled before construction commenced.

5000|$|The Anderson {{condensing}} system [...] uses an {{air-cooled condenser}} but the steam is only partially condensed {{to form an}} aerosol of water droplets in steam. This aerosol is then liquified by pressure, using a specially-designed <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>pump.</b> A fuel saving of nearly 30% (compared with exhausting to the atmosphere) was claimed for the Anderson system but this seems paradoxical. One would expect a higher fuel consumption because of the power required to compress the aerosol.|$|E
30|$|Due to the requirements, each {{power unit}} should be {{equipped}} {{with at least two}} <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>pumps</b> whose nominal capacity should ensure the maximum capacity of the once-through boiler. The value of the pumping effective pressure is included in the range of 1.1 - 1.4 of the steam pressure rating in the boiler. The efficiency of modern <b>feed</b> <b>pumps</b> exceeds 85 %. The demand for power while <b>pumping</b> <b>feed</b> water is from 2 % to 4.2 % of the power generated by the unit [2]. Consequently, the driving motor of the <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> is usually the principal receiver of electricity in the power plant.|$|R
30|$|Condensing {{turbines}} {{to drive}} <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>pumps</b> are usually fed with the steam from the outlet of the intermediate-pressure turbine or steam from the intermediate-pressure turbine bleeds, {{and they give}} steam to the main or additional condenser. The amount of steam needed to drive the condensing turbine reduces the mass flow through the low-pressure turbine and can contribute {{to a reduction in}} the total discharge loss and, consequently, reduce the heat consumption per unit. Therefore, an application of a condensing turbine to drive the <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> is more effective if the low-pressure turbine is heavily loaded.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} stages of H.P. feed heating with six heater shells {{arranged}} in parallel pairs, a de-aerator and three low pressure heaters. Steam is bled {{from the main}} turbine H.P. exhaust to drive the main <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> turbine, which exhausts to the feed heating system to improve the overall cycle efficiency. The main feed pump turbine is a 15,150 hp single-cylinder impulse machine with steam conditions, at the h.p. exhaust, of 610 psia (42.06 bar) at 366 °C. The rotor has eleven stages and the steam is exhausted to the de-aerator at 52 psia. (3.585 bar) at 144 °C. The pump is a six-stage centrifugal unit with a capacity of 1588 t/h (3,500,000 lb/h). Two 50 per cent duty start-up and standby feed pumps, electrically driven, are also provided.|$|E
50|$|Following {{condensation}} of the {{low pressure}} exhaust steam in the condenser, the feed water is passed to a condensate sump mounted under the condenser. From this receiver the condensate is drawn by one or two extraction pumps and passed through a discharge strainer. The low pressure feed heating system consists of five Direct Contact heaters with one high level deaerator to provide a high feed pump suction head. The Direct Contact L.P. heaters are arranged in two banks, comprising three and two heaters respectively. Within each bank the heaters are stacked above each other so that the condensate drains from the lower pressure heater below by gravity. The heights of the heaters are approximately inversely proportional to the bled steam pressures. The advantages of Direct Contact heaters are essentially that thermal efficiency is improved, capital cost is reduced due to fewer numbers of extraction pumps being required, and the system is entirely ferrous. The main extraction pump discharges the condensate to No.1 D.C. heater from which it cascades down to No.2 and then to No.3 D.C. heater by gravity. Two lift pumps deliver the condensate to No.4 D.C. heater, from which it cascades through No.5 D.C. heater to two deaerator lift pumps. The deaerator lift pumps discharge the condensate to the deaerator and from there it passes to the <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> suction main through microwire and magnetic filters. The main <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> is driven by a steam turbine which receives its steam from the main H.P. turbine exhaust. It comprises a single cylinder eleven stage turbine turning at 5,000 rev/min (31.42 Rad/min) and driving a multi-stage pump to give a delivery pressure of 2,067 tonne/m2 (2,940 lbf/in2). Two electrically driven Starting and Standby feed pumps are provided. The high pressure heating system consists of two parallel banks of two heaters being numbered 7 and 8 stages in the system. Each of the H.P. heaters is vertical and of the non-contact type. From the H.P. heaters the condensate, at a temperature of 253 degrees Celsius (455 degrees Fahrenheit), is passed into the boiler economiser. During unit shutdowns {{the whole of the}} feed system can be ‘blanketed’ with nitrogen gas. This is an attempt to reduce the rate at which copper and ferrous oxides form, hence reduce the ‘carrying over’ of these oxides to the boiler drum. Boiler feed water make-up is supplied by the Water Treatment Plant. This has a continuous rating of 3,672,000 Litres (970,000 gallons) in 24 hours at 153,300 Litres (40,500 gallons) per hour. The plant comprises three groups of cation, anion and mixed bed ion exchange resin units, together with vacuum degassing and pressure filtering plant. Each group processes 76,650 Litres (20,250 gallons) per hour and normally two groups are in service at one time, with the third on standby or being regenerated.|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 85 A {{systematic}} {{investigation was}} started within the Texas Utilities Generating Company Power station feedwater pump systems due to unsatisfactory unit availability, frequent equipment breakdown, high maintenance costs, and high replacement parts costs. This action was greatly encouraged by successful corrective {{actions taken by}} other utilities [1, 2, 3], results of failure surveys across the U. S. A [4, 5), and systematic long range research and development, field testing and troubleshooting by the authors, and close cooperation and exchange of ideas and results with at least on oil company [6]. A total of 36 pumps was modified in the Texas Utilities system as described in this paper. This included 16 <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>pumps</b> (BFP), 7 high pressure (HP) booster pumps, 6 low pressure (LP) booster pumps, and 7 other pump applications. The operating behavior of all pumps improved exactly as expected, {{with the exception of}} one high pressure booster pump, which is described as a special case, with the emphasis on the importance or re-assembly and maintenance procedures. The power plants and the type of pumps involved in this investigation and corrective design changes are reflected in Table 1. Basically, we have to distinguish between multistage <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>pumps</b> (or process pumps) and single stage double suction booster pumps (or condensate, ash sluice, circulating, cooling water, etc) because the same hydraulically induced instability problem manifests itself in a very different way through the type of vibrations we experience and measure.

50|$|The 500 MW {{single shaft}} {{machines}} manufactured by English Electric, are arranged lengthwise along the turbine hall, which is 259.08 m (850 ft) long by 39.624 m (130 ft) wide by 26.060 m (85.5 ft) high. The overall length of each machine is 49.53 m (162.5 ft). The generators are rated at 500 MW, 22 kV at 0.85 power factor. Steam {{conditions at the}} H.P. turbine stop valve are 2,300 psig (158.6 bar). at 566 °C with a single reheat stage to the I.P. cylinder of 565 psia (38.96 bar) at 566 °C. The turbine has a design steam consumption of 6.3932 lb/kWh, including reheating, feed heating, and <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> drive and an overall heat input of 7,543 Btu/kWh. A novel mounting arrangement was adopted for the turbo-generators. The L.P. cylinders are supported on two steel beams about 22.098 m (72.5 ft) long, which bridge between the concrete blocks at the H.P. steam and generator ends of the sets. The fabricated condenser structure was welded directly to {{the underside of the}} L.P. frame using a pre-heated welding technique. This provides a compact arrangement of the condenser and the main set and is {{a major factor in the}} reduction of size related to the output of the machines, which is a striking feature of the turbine hall. The L.P. frame is supported at its corners, each of the supports taking about 203.2 tonnes (200 tons) in weight. The overall weight of the frame and condenser structure is some 2,235 tonnes (2,200 tons) of which 1,422 tonnes (1,400 tons) is supported on the bottom of the condenser by the mounting springs. The condensers were fabricated on site by English Electric from sub assemblies and welded to the bridge beams supporting the L.P. cylinder. There are over 40,000 9.144 m (30 ft) long, 25.4 mm (1 in) diameter aluminium/brass tubes in each condenser, giving an effective surface area of 27,870 m² (300,000 sq ft) the equivalent of 3.9 football pitches. Operation is at 1.3 inHg with 1,023 m³/min (225,000 gal of cooling water at 15.5 °C. Steam is passed to the condenser at over 963.9 t/h (2,125,000 lb/h). Since contamination of the condensate by the cooling water must be avoided, a double tube plate construction has been adopted in which the condenser tubes are expanded into an extra tubeplate in addition to the one forming the side of the water box. The narrow space between the plates is filled with demineralised water, supplied from a header tank from 48.768 m (160 ft). This provides a pressure considerably higher than the 20 psig developed in the cooling water system, so that any leaks on the tube end plates will be supplied from the header tank.|$|E

3000|$|Coal-based {{electric}} power generation remains the basic source of obtaining energy. With increasing pressure to reduce CO 2 emissions, improving power unit efficiency has become an issue of utmost significance. Surely, one of the possibilities to improve the efficiency of new power units is raising the steam parameters. With improved power plant efficiency, there is a lower demand for power of almost all auxiliary equipment except the <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>pump.</b> The {{reason for this is}} that the power needed to drive the feed pump is an almost linear function of the steam pressure.

50|$|The plant's steam {{generators}} each produce approx. 7 million lbs. of steam per hour at 3,800 psi and 1,005 deg. F., {{with a single}} reheat to the same temperature. Each unit has two <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>pumps,</b> {{one of which is}} run by its own steam turbine, and the other of which is powered via the low-pressure turbine-generator through a fluid coupling (so rpm may be varied to maintain the proper boiler feedwater flow and pressure). An auxiliary boiler provides steam for the <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> with its own turbine in order to provide flow through the boiler at startup without drawing power off the grid. One of the earlier supercritical plants in the country, the boiler design incorporates an improvement over the first full-scale supercritical units at Eddystone Electric Generating Station, near Philadelphia. This improvement is a re-circulation circuit that increases water flow through the water walls surrounding the lower furnace in order to protect them during startup with considerably less flow through the entire boiler, thus saving fuel wasted as boiler flow is bypassed to the condenser during startup.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Nuclear {{power plant}} has a {{provision}} of two independent sources {{of power for}} its in-plant auxiliary loads required for the operation of plant.

40|$|Lecturepg. 103 Cavitation {{occurring}} in high-energy pump impellers {{often results in}} material erosion and system instabilities. Excessive erosion rates compromise life and increase ownership costs through higher maintenance and reduced availability. Instabilities in the pumping system resulting from the presence of unsteady volumes of vapor resulting pressure pulsations and unsteady flow delivery. This behavior is {{a legacy of the}} increase in pump size and energy level that were required to support larger and more critical processes. The increased requirements resulted in ?scaled-up? impeller designs that were not suited to deal with the resulting cavitation behavior. During the late 1980 s to 1990 s numerous development efforts were undertaken to correct these design issues. There has been little follow-up of these efforts so that the degree of success is largely undocumented. This paper revisits two such redesign efforts for <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>pumps</b> that presented two separate challenges.

An analysis is presented that calculates the leakage flow rate, the torque loss, and the rotordynamic coefficients for parallel-grooved seals. To demonstrate this analysis, we show the effect of changing number of stages, land and groove width, and inlet swirl on stability of the <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> water <b>pump</b> seals.

30|$|Under a {{low load}} of the unit, the steam mass {{flow through the}} {{low-pressure}} turbine is usually not big enough which causes the danger of {{a substantial increase in}} the temperature of the blades. As a rule, the problem is solved by increasing the steam mass flow from the intermediate- to the low-pressure turbine. Under low loads of the unit, there may then be not enough steam fed into the turbine driving the feed pump which necessitates an introduction of additional steam into it. This may cause mechanical problems because the turbine driving the <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> was designed for lower parameters of the incoming steam. In consequence, additional facilities are required for the system, which increase the investment costs of the plant. Another option in this situation is a transition to an electric drive of the <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|E

50|$|Pumps in this {{category}} range from simplex, with one cylinder, to in some cases quad (four) cylinders, or more. Many reciprocating-type pumps are duplex (two) or triplex (three) cylinder. They can be either single-acting with suction during one direction of piston motion and discharge on the other, or double-acting with suction and discharge in both directions. The pumps can be powered manually, by air or steam, or by a belt driven by an engine. This type of pump was used extensively in the 19th century—in {{the early days of}} steam propulsion—as <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> water <b>pumps.</b> Now reciprocating pumps typically pump highly viscous fluids like concrete and heavy oils, and serve in special applications that demand low flow rates against high resistance.

40|$|LecturePg. 59 - 66 In the past, large {{compressors}} in the {{petrochemical industry}} were mostly driven {{in one of}} two ways: by steam (or gas) turbines or by constant speed electrical motors. If the flow of the compressor had to be controlled, two ways were possible: to control its speed or to control its suction. If flow control was required, the steam (or gas) turbine was the right answer, since in-plant steam could be produced at a rather low cost (gas could be purchased for an equally low price). In the case of more continuous, even flow rates, the constant speed electric motor was a good alternative. For startup, the compressor was bypassed and, if a certain control was necessary, suction control was used without even looking at the power consumption. Highly increased fuel cost, especially for in-plant steam generation, has made commercially available electric power from large generating plants more attractive. On the other hand, for the same reason, energy conservation makes speed control much superior to suction control and last, but not least, the more diversified nature of feed stocks as well as more fluctuating production rates call more often for compressors to be controlled. The same is valid for other centrifugal machines such as <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> water <b>pumps</b> and pipeline loading pumps. Today, more and more compressors are driven by variable speed devices other than steam turbines. One way is to use purely electric drives, which are, however, still in the trial phase regarding large horsepower. Another, much more proven way is to use, in connection with a standard constant speed electric motor, a hydrodynamic, so-called, fluid coupling. The type of fluid coupling mostly used for this application is the one with integrated gears. This kind of machine, relatively new to the petrochemical community, has, however, proven its high reliability and availability in thousands of applications in the power generating industry, mostly with <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>pumps.</b> Other applications have included installations in oil producing and shipping plants, on platforms offshore and onshore, and with pipeline and loading pumps. Successful compressor applications go back some 15 years, with numbers increasing over the last three to four years. These compressor applications go up to 10, 000 hp, with output speeds reaching 12, 000 rpm. Pump applications with many more years of case history exist up to 30, 000 hp, with designs available for 60, 000 hp. There are many more applications of the hydrodynamic principle in numerous other industries, in the form of fluid couplings and torque converters, as well as combined transmissions. The intention herein is to describe the hydrodynamic principle and its technical application in the following areas: ? Basic function of hydrodynamic variable speed fluid couplings ? Advantages of using such couplings ? Successful designs of such couplings ? Typical applications with centrifugal machines ? Speed control options and instrumentation ?
