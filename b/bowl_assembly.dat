40|$|Case StudyCS 1 Four 580 HP {{cooling tower}} feed pumps were {{upgraded}} by retrofitting improved <b>bowl</b> <b>assemblies</b> with enclosed stainless-steel impellers. Pumps exhibited capacity limitation up to 50 % of rated and cavitation damage in original semi-open cast iron impellers, requiring continuous operation of all installed equipment, including the stand-by pump, to cover plant requirements. Performance of the pumps was optimized by rework of new impellers and stand testing to satisfy guarantee point and improve efficiency to accommodate power limitation of existing drivers. As a result, rated capacity was recovered, allowing one pump in stand-by, {{with a significant}} reliability improvement and considerable savings in maintenance costs, together with a lower capital investment compared to {{the replacement of the}} complete units...|$|R

40|$|Parts orienting, {{the process}} of {{bringing}} parts in initially unknown orientations to a goal orientation, is {{an important aspect of}} automated <b>assembly.</b> <b>Bowl</b> feeders used in industry rely on a sequence of mechanical operations, without using sensors, to orient parts. In our work, we use partial information sensors along with mechanical operations to eliminate uncertainty in part orientation. We show that sensorbased orienting plans need O(m) operations, where m is the maximum number of states with the same sensor value. We characterize the relation between part shape, orientability, and recognizability to identify conditions under which a single plan can orient and recognize multiple part shapes. We describe implemented planners and experiments to demonstrate generated plans. 1 Introduction A parts orienting system must bring randomly oriented parts to goal orientations for <b>assembly.</b> <b>Bowl</b> feeders, widely used in industry, rely on mechanical operations to orient parts (Boothroyd et al.

50|$|The first 300 Corvettes were hand {{built at}} {{a plant in}} Flint, Michigan in 1953. Production was moved the next year to a {{facility}} in St. Louis, Missouri and then finally ended up in 1981 at the <b>Bowling</b> Green <b>Assembly</b> Plant. General Motors opened the Bowling Green plant for production on June 1 that year, {{with most of the}} 900 Corvette workers from St. Louis transferring to the new plant. What was once an abandoned Chrysler air-conditioning unit factory is now a one million square foot facility that employs almost one thousand people. Guided tours of the plant are available throughout the year on weekdays, three times a day.|$|R
2500|$|The fourth {{generation}} Corvette {{was the first}} complete redesign of the Corvette since 1963. Production was to begin for the 1983 model year but quality issues and part delays resulted in only 43 prototypes for the 1983 model year being produced that were never sold. All of the 1983 prototypes were destroyed or serialized to 1984 except one with a white exterior, medium blue interior, L83 350 ci, 205bhp V8, and 4-speed automatic transmission. After extensive testing and modifications were completed, it was initially retired as a display sitting in an external wall over the <b>Bowling</b> Green <b>Assembly</b> Plant's employee entrance. Later this only surviving 1983 prototype was removed, restored and is now on public display at the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky. It is still owned by GM. [...] On February 12, 2014, it was nearly lost to a sinkhole which opened up under the museum. [...] Eight other Corvettes were severely damaged.|$|R
50|$|The World Bible Quiz Association is an {{independent}} ministry that sponsors quizzing across denominational lines. Its game format is most similar to Nazarene, Free Methodist and Alliance quizzing, and most competing teams come from those three groups. The WBQA has an eight-year cycle of the material studied for each season, which {{is followed by the}} Missionary Church quiz program and Wesleyan Bible <b>Bowl,</b> and previously <b>Assemblies</b> of God Teen Bible Quiz. The cycle rotates as follows: Luke (2008-09), followed by 1 & 2 Corinthians, John, Hebrews & 1-2 Peter, Matthew, Romans & James, Acts, and Galatians/Ephesians/Philippians/Colossians/Philemon.|$|R
5000|$|A bong {{is similar}} to a pipe, only it has a water-chamber through which {{cannabis}} smoke passes prior to inhalation and a wide [...] "mouth" [...] typically around 3.8 - 5.1 cm in diameter. Users fill the bong with water, sometimes also adding ice in order to cool the smoke. This cooling effect allows a larger amount of cannabis to be consumed at once while reducing the discomfort caused by the heat of the smoke. The <b>bowl</b> and stem <b>assembly</b> of most bongs is removed briefly after the cannabis is burned, allowing clean air to circulate and clear the smoke chamber, ensuring no smoke dissipates without being properly consumed.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the errors}} {{inherent}} in the heading indications of a magnetic compass {{are related to the}} compass' construction. An aircraft compass consists of an inverted bowl with a magnetized bar attached. The bowl is balanced on a low friction pin. The <b>bowl</b> and pin <b>assembly</b> is enclosed in a case filled with non-acidic kerosene. The magnetized bar tends to orient the assembly with the local geomagnetic field. The bar turns the visible bowl of the compass. The outside surface of the bowl includes markings to indicate a magnetic heading. As the aircraft (and the compass housing) turns, the bowl remains somewhat stationary with respect to the earth due to the magnetic attraction. In summary, the aircraft is free to turn around the stationary bowl.|$|R
40|$|Adult {{stem cells}} have the unique ability to either self-renew or differentiate, thus giving them {{tremendous}} therapeutic potential. These tissue-specific {{stem cells are}} directed to self-renew by signals from the local microenvironment termed the stem cell niche. While reconstitution assays have demonstrated the existence of stem cell niches in many adult organs, unambiguous identification of the resident stem cells and their niche cells {{continues to be a}} challenge. Accordingly, the mechanisms that direct specification and formation of a stem cell niche in vivo remain unclear. The Drosophila testis has emerged as a powerful system in which to study stem cell-niche interactions. The niche cells, called hub cells, form a small aggregate at the apical tip of the testis. Hub cells promote attachment and self-renewal in the germline stem cells and cyst stem cells, which are organized in a radial array around the hub. The signaling pathways that direct the maintenance and differentiation of these lineages have been well characterized; however, the initial specification and organization of the niche is still being elucidated. It was previously shown that Notch activation in a subset of somatic gonadal precursors specifies them as hub cells in the embryonic gonad. Here we use genetic analysis to show that Notch signaling activates a branched pathway for hub cell differentiation. Along one arm of the pathway, the Maf factor Traffic jam is downregulated to allow for niche signaling and adhesion. Along a separate arm, the transcription factor <b>Bowl,</b> promotes the <b>assembly</b> of hub cells at the anterior of the gonad where they recruit and organize stem cells. We also use live imaging to reveal two phases of niche morphogenesis; 1) a sorting and guidance phase in which hub cells are directed to the anterior by an extra-gonadal cue and 2) a compaction phase characterized by the formation of an acto-myosin cable around the compacting hub concomitant with the onset of oriented GSC divisions. These observations suggest a model in which the germ cells shape their own niche by driving hub compaction. These findings greatly advance our understanding of how a stem cell niche develops within a tissue. ...|$|R
