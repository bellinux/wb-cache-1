60|$|There {{are many}} other {{circumstances}} of fraud and falsehood attending this petition, (we must call things by their proper names, my Lords,)--there are, I say, many circumstances of fraud and falsehood. We know it to have been impossible, {{at the time of}} presenting this petition, that this man should have expended thirty thousand pounds in the preparation of materials for his defence; and your Lordships' justice, together with the credit of the House of Commons, are concerned in the discovery of the truth. There is, indeed, an ambiguous word in the petition. He asserts that he is engaged for the payment of that sum. We asked the clerks of the India House whether he had given them any <b>bond,</b> <b>note,</b> security, or promise of payment: they assured us that he had not: they will be ready to make the same assurance to your Lordships, when you come to inquire into this matter, which before you give judgment we desire and claim that you will do.

50|$|The OCR {{went into}} {{receivership}} in June 1908 and Asa E. Ramsey was appointed as receiver. Trains {{were reduced to}} mixed service (passenger and freight on the same train), and cost-cutting measures were introduced. Unfortunately, the coal-burning steam locomotives of the Santa Fe had primarily switched to fuel oil, and the coal traffic from Lehigh became less profitable. A coal miner's strike in 1911 ended the mines and the OCR lost {{a major component of}} its revenue stream. On May 27, 1914, the Santa Fe obtained a five-year lease agreement with a $2,000,000 purchase option. Unable to meet its mounting construction debt, the line was sold to the Santa Fe in 1917 for 25 cents on each $1000 <b>bond</b> <b>note,</b> and was merged into the Santa Fe in 1942.|$|E

50|$|Hundreds {{of protesters}} {{gathered}} in Harare on 3 August 2016, marching against {{the introduction of}} <b>bond</b> <b>notes,</b> {{with the aim of}} submitting a petition to the Ministry of Finance and Parliament. The protest was sanctioned by the courts, and the first petition rejecting <b>bond</b> <b>notes</b> was successfully delivered to the ministry. However, as protesters headed to Parliament to deliver a second petition, police chased and beat some of them using baton sticks and water canons, leading to dispersion of the crowd. One BBC journalist was also beaten up by police in the scuffle and had his video camera broken. On the same day, expelled former vice-president Joice Mujuru filed a lawsuit at the Constitutional Court against Mugabe and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, among other respondents, urging them to declare the introduction of <b>bond</b> <b>notes</b> unconstitutional.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe {{unveiled}} [...] "convertible" [...] {{coins in}} denominations of US$0.01 through US$0.50.

[...] As of May 2016 the liquidity of the USD had rapidly decreased and John Mangudya, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, said Zimbabwe would print new <b>bond</b> <b>note</b> which he was said would be at par with the American dollar. This was to be done within the following two months. Some citizens disputed this, saying the 2008 error was now returning and they would not accept the bond notes.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies Merton 2 ̆ 7 s optimal portfolio problem {{applied to}} an investor who trades in a Credit Default Swap (CDS). This work began {{under the guidance}} of Dr Capponi following his previous analysis Capponi and Figueroa [2011] with corporate bonds. We study the a portfolio optimization problem of a speculative investor allocating the wealth to an equity, a money market account and to a Credit Default Swap. This work is differentiated from Capponi and Figueroa [2011] since they analyze a portfolio of an equity, money market account and a zero-coupon corporate bond. The primary difference is our consideration of a CDS instead of a defaultable <b>bond.</b> <b>Note</b> that there is {{a significant difference in the}} reward structure of these two assets. The CDS has a continuous payment while the bond does not. Also, we consider the correlation between the CDS and the equity. ^ Initially, we assume a market existing in a single regime and market coefficients are assumed to be constant. Under these assumptions, the dynamics of the CDS price are determined in terms of a stochastic differential equation. The utility maximization problem is solved using a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and verification theorems are shown for its solution. Explicit optimal strategies are obtained for an investor with a logarithmic utility function. ^ With data from the last 150 years, we see that the corporate bond market suffers repeated clustered defaults. Since we are considering CDS that are written on corporate bonds, we incorporate this market behavior by modeling the economy to exist in multiple regimes. The market coefficients are assumed to depend on the regime in place. This regime is modeled by a nite state continuous Markov process. The CDS price dynamics is determined in terms of a Markov modulated stochastic differential equation and the Utility maximization problem is solved in the same way as above. Explicit optimal strategies are obtained for a logarithmic investor in a market that exists in 3 regimes. ^ In the last chapter, we extend the work done in Capponi and Figueroa [2011] to the situation where the assets are correlated with one another. Over the last 10 years, it has been observed that the credit markets and the equity markets are correlated. To incorporate this behavior, we model the default process as a doubly stochastic Poisson process where the default rate is a function of the stock price. The CDS price dynamics are determined as a function of the stock price and the utility maximization problem is solved in a similar fashion. Explicit strategies are obtained for a logarithmic investor. We see that the optimal investment in the CDS and stock are dependent on each other. ...|$|E

The Cooperative Farm Credit System has become a major supplier of credit to agricul-ture.

This entailed 36 per-cent of all farm real estate debt and 25 per-cent of all farm nonreal estate debt. The System obtains funds for loans from the na-tional money market by issuing system-wide consolidated <b>bonds</b> and discount <b>notes.</b> The interest cost on <b>bonds</b> and <b>notes</b> depends upon market interest rates which have been very volatile in recent years and are not controllable by the System [Bildersee].
