25|$|The IRA's attack {{involved}} two teams. One {{team would}} drive a digger with {{a bomb in}} its bucket through the base's perimeter fence and light the fuse. At the same time, the other team would arrive in a van and open fire on the base, {{with the goal of}} killing three RUC officers as they came off duty. Both teams would then leave the area in the van. To avoid security checkpoints, the bomb was ferried by boat across Lough Neagh, from Ardboe to Maghery. The van and digger that would be used were hijacked in the hours leading up to the attack. The van, a blue Toyota HiAce, was stolen by masked men from a business in Dungannon. At about the same time, the unit's commander Jim Lynagh was spotted in the town, suggesting the van may be used in the attack. The digger (a <b>backhoe</b> <b>loader)</b> was taken from a farm at Lislasly Road, about two miles west of Loughgall. Two IRA members stayed at the farm to stop the owners raising the alarm. IRA member Declan Arthurs drove the digger, while two others drove ahead of him in a scout car. The rest of the unit travelled in the van from another location, presumably also with a scout car. When a covert observation post monitoring the digger reported that it was being moved, the SAS took up its positions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Backhoe</b> <b>loaders</b> can be {{designed}} and manufactured from the start as such, or can {{be the result of}} a farm tractor equipped with a front end loader (FEL) and rear backhoe. Though similar looking, the purpose-designed <b>backhoe</b> <b>loaders</b> are much stronger, with the farm variation unsuitable for heavy work. The farm variation also requires that the operator switch seats from {{sitting in front of the}} backhoe controls to the tractor seat in order to reposition the equipment while digging, and this often slows down the digging process.|$|R

50|$|Evolving in {{parallel}} to {{development in the}} U.S., backhoes were first produced in the UK in 1953 by JCB, {{but it was just}} a prototype. The world's first <b>backhoe</b> <b>loader</b> with factory warranty was introduced in U.S. by CASE in 1957. Model 320 was the world's first serial <b>backhoe</b> <b>loader.</b> Although based on a tractor, a <b>backhoe</b> <b>loader</b> was and is almost never called a tractor when both the loader and the backhoe are permanently attached. Backhoe loaders are also not generally used for towing and usually do not have a power take-off (PTO) as often this is used to drive the hydraulic pump operating the attachments. When the backhoe is permanently attached, the machine usually has a seat that can swivel to the rear to face the hoe controls. Removable backhoe attachments almost always have a separate seat on the attachment itself.|$|E
