Studied in this thesis is the formulation of lateral control algorithms for articulated vehicles performing a lane following maneuver on Automated Highway Systems (AHS). A steering control algorithm using the input/output linearization scheme is first developed and then the steering controller is augmented with an independent <b>braking</b> <b>controller</b> which provides differential torque for directly controlling the trailer yaw motion by applying unilateral tire braking on the trailer rear wheels. It is shown by simulations, that improved lane following performance is achieved by using the steering and independent braking control strategy.
