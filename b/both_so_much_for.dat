60|$|It is not {{therefore}} to be wondered at {{that we hear}} <b>both</b> parties plead <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> their authority, crying out against each other, as those that destroy religion. So doth the church, so doth the man of sin. The living child is mine, saith one; nay, but the dead child is thine, and the living child is mine, says the other. And thus they spake before the king (1 Kings 3:16-22). Now this could not be, were there not different apprehensions here; light against light then {{is the cause of}} all this; and here is 'light against light in three ranks'; and so will be until the beast is dead.|$|R
5000|$|Edwards is {{best known}} for {{directing}} most of the comedy film series The Pink Panther, all of those starring Peter Sellers as the inept Inspector Clouseau. The relationship between the director and the lead actor was considered a fruitful, yet complicated, with many disagreements during production. At various times in their film relationship, [...] "he more than once swore off Sellers" [...] as too hard to direct. However, in his later years, he admitted that working with Sellers was often irresistible: [...] "We clicked on comedy, and we were lucky we found each other, because we <b>both</b> had <b>so</b> <b>much</b> respect <b>for</b> it. We also had an ability to come up with funny things and great situations that had to be explored. But in that exploration there would oftentimes be disagreement. But I couldn't resist those moments when we jelled. And if you ask me who contributed most to those things, it couldn't have happened unless both of us were involved, even though it wasn't always happy." ...|$|R

Bless me! there would be small charge on that last, I'm thinking. But come, Eva," [...] he said; and taking the hand of his daughter, he stepped across the boat, and {{carelessly}} putting {{the tip of his}} finger under Tom's chin, said, good-humoredly, [...] "Look-up, Tom, and see how you like your new master." ...|$|R
