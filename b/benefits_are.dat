5|$|Contraceptive use in {{developing}} countries is estimated to have decreased the number of maternal deaths by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% of deaths if the full demand for birth control were met. These <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> achieved by {{reducing the number of}} unplanned pregnancies that subsequently result in unsafe abortions and by preventing pregnancies in those at high risk.|$|E

50|$|The {{investigation}} <b>benefit</b> <b>was</b> {{a special}} <b>benefit</b> {{to the property}} because it was unique. The value of the special <b>benefit</b> <b>was</b> over $100,000. This amount outweighs {{the value of the}} land taken, therefore, once the special <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> deducted from the value of the land taken, the landowners are not entitled to just compensation.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} liberal social reforms {{in areas like}} censorship, homosexuality, divorce, education, and worker {{participation}} in company management were introduced, whilst social security <b>benefits</b> <b>were</b> significantly increased. Increases were made in unemployment benefits, while substantial improvements in <b>benefits</b> <b>were</b> made for farmers, students, war invalids, the sick, families with many children, women, and pensioners between 1970 and 1975, {{which led to a}} doubling of benefit and social security payments during that period. By 1979, old age and survivors’ <b>benefits</b> <b>were</b> 53% higher in real terms than in 1970, while family <b>benefits</b> <b>were</b> 95% higher.|$|R
5|$|In 2011, the American College of Physicians (ACP) {{issued a}} {{clinical}} practice guideline making three strong recommendations based on moderate-quality evidence: that hospitalized patients be assessed for {{their risk of}} thromboembolism and bleeding before prophylaxis is started; that heparin or a related drug be used if potential <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> thought to outweigh potential harms; and that graduated compression stockings not be used. The ACP also drew attention {{to a lack of}} support for any performance measures encouraging physicians to apply universal prophylaxis without regard to the risks.|$|E
5|$|Membership {{into the}} program is free. The program is divided into four tiers: Green, Silver, Gold, and Diamond. Infinity MileageLands {{privileges}} are additive by membership tier, with higher tiers including all benefits listed for prior tiers. The program accepts miles flown on partner airlines and Star Alliance partners such as All Nippon Airways and United Airlines, provided that the flights are booked and logged according to EVA Air frequent flier rules. Co-branded American Express, Citibank, and Diners Club cards can also earn miles. Qualification levels and general <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> listed on the EVA Air website.|$|E

5|$|Oneworld {{has three}} premium status levels—Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald—based on the customer's tier {{status in the}} member airline's frequent-flyer program. Emerald status is the highest level in each member's programme, {{and all of the}} statuses are {{recognised}} by each of the member airlines. The premium statuses have no specific requirements of their own; membership is based solely on the frequent-flyer programs of the individual member airline. Alliance <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> only available to passengers on scheduled flights that are both operated and marketed by a member airline.|$|E
5|$|Simon & Garfunkel's Concert in Central Park raised around $51,000 for Central Park. Benefit concerts {{by other}} musicians followed, {{and helped to}} raise {{awareness}} of the park's state. With donations from the general public {{and with the help of}} wealthy benefactors, the park was restored during the 1980s and gained recognition as a major tourist attraction. As of 2011, donations still make up the majority of its budget. Today concerts and other <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> regularly held on the Great Lawn.|$|E
5|$|Some {{concerns}} {{have also been}} expressed regarding the effects of cordon area congestion pricing on economic activity and land use, as the <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> usually evaluated from the urban transportation perspective only.

5|$|Tonsillectomy {{may be a}} {{reasonable}} preventive measure in those with frequent throat infections (more than three a year). However, the <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> small and episodes typically lessen in time regardless of measures taken. Recurrent episodes of pharyngitis which test positive for GAS may also represent {{a person who is}} a chronic carrier of GAS who is getting recurrent viral infections. Treating people who have been exposed but who are without symptoms is not recommended. Treating people who are carriers of GAS is not recommended as the risk of spread and complications is low.|$|E
5|$|As with {{obesity in}} adults, many factors {{contribute}} to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity {{are believed to be}} the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity. Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver. Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group. Multi-component behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although the <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> small and quality of evidence is low.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2008, {{a bridge}} {{replacement}} and expansion project got underway on Illinois 22 at the interchange with Interstate 94. This {{was necessary for}} the tollway which travels underneath to be widened to eight lanes. The old bridge, which was five lanes wide, was rebuilt with one that is eight lanes and includes full length dual left turn lanes in both directions. Other <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> the improved entrances and exits {{to and from the}} interstate, modernized traffic signals, and the use of concrete pavement. The bulk of the work was completed by December 2009, however both sets of dual left turn lanes were not in operation until the following spring.|$|E
30|$|In {{terms of}} the industry, {{industrial}} departments with major direct economic <b>benefit</b> <b>are</b> chemical industry, production and supply of electric power and heat power, processing of petroleum, coking, processing of nuclear fuel, smelting and rolling of metals, manufacturing of foods and tobacco. The proportion of their total direct economic <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> 76.74 %, {{and the proportion of}} their total comprehensive economic <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> 77.75 %, which are basically proportional to the five departments’ water consumption. On the other hand, departments with higher-water-output effect of Beijing include manufacturing of transport equipment, mining of nonmetal ores, manufacturing of electrical machinery and instrument, manufacturing of instrument, apparatus and cultural and office work machinery, and production and supply of gas. The proportion of these five departments’ total direct economic <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> only 4.08 %, which the proportion of their total comprehensive economic <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> 2.42 %, which are minor proportions.|$|R

5|$|Beyond {{the obvious}} honour, the award also carries a cash {{allowance}} for those under {{the rank of}} lieutenant (or the appropriate service equivalent), {{and in some cases}} a cash award. Upon the death of the recipient, the pension is transferred to the widow until her death or remarriage. In the case of a posthumous recipient who is a bachelor, the allowance is paid to his father or mother. In the case of the award being conferred posthumously on a widower, the allowance is to be paid to his son or unmarried daughter. A monthly stipend of 10,000 rupees is given the awardee. The award amount and pension <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> exempted from income tax. In addition, different ministries under the Central Government have various awards for PVC winners.|$|E

Some airlines also offer preferred seating (an exit seat or a special section of the plane); guaranteed seating on fully booked flights, subject to the booking class code and notice period, and free upgrades {{in the form of a}} voucher, certificate or automatic upgrade at check-in. United restricts US lounge access for their Gold Members to long-haul international passengers; Gold members from other carriers are welcome in US lounges run by United on all itineraries.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} a family’s monthly benefit payment depends on that family's {{specific}} characteristics and financial circumstances, {{as well as}} the overall amount of program funds available for distribution. The latest statistics show that benefits average $103 each month (2003, see table below right). It is the Puerto Rico government's responsibility to establish the eligibility requirements and benefit levels for participation in the program.

40|$|Rationing by {{waiting time}} is {{commonly}} used in health care systems with zero or low money prices. Some systems prioritise particular types of patient and offer them lower waiting times.

We show that positive prioritisation (shorter waits for patients with higher observable <b>benefit)</b> <b>is</b> welfare improving if the mean observable benefit of the patients who are indifferent about receiving the treat- ment is larger than the mean observable benefit of the patients who receive the treatment.
