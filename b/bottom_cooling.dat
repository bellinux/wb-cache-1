Adjusting the relative humidity in the vessel {{is one of the most}} important parameters to be controlled. Use of gas-permeable membranes may help in this regard as this allows increased exchange of water vapor and other gases such as ethylene with the surrounding environment. Using higher concentration of a gelling agent, on top of the use of a higher-strength gelling agent may reduce the risk from hyperhydricity. Hyperhydricity can also be controlled by <b>bottom</b> <b>cooling,</b> which allows water to condense on the medium, the use of cytokinin-meta-topolin (6-(3-Hydroxybenzylamino)purine)</9>, the combination of lower cytokinin and ammonium nitrate in the medium, use of nitrate or glutamine as the sole nitrogen source and decreasing the ratio of NH4+:NO3- in the medium.In studies on calcium deficiency in tissue cultures of Lavandula angustifolia, it was shown that an increase in calcium in the medium reduced hyperhydricity.|$|E

The presence of thermodiffusion shows considerable difference in the composition of the solidified rod, compared with the one without considering the effect of thermodiffusion. Thermodiffusion also causes a faster solidification and a more uniform concentration distribution.

40|$|A {{model for}} {{transient}} movements of solidification fronts {{has been added}} to X-stream, an existing multi-physics simulation program for high temperature processes with flow and chemical reactions. The implementation uses an enthalpy formulation and works on fixed grids. First we show the results of a 2 D tin solidification benchmark case, which allows a comparison of X-stream to two other codes and to measurements. Second, a complete 3 D solar silicon Heat Exchange Method (HEM) furnace, as built by PVA TePla is modeled. Here, it was necessary to model the complete geometry including the quartz crucible, radiative heaters, <b>bottom</b> <b>cooling,</b> inert flushing gas, etc. For one specific recipe of the transient heater power steering, PVA TePla conducted dip-rod measurements of the silicon solidification front position as function of time. This yields a validation of the model when applied to a real life industrial crystallization process. The results indicate that melt convection does influence the energy distribution up to the start of crystallization at the crucible bottom. But from that point on, the release of latent heat seems to dominate the solidification process, and convection in the melt does not significantly influence the transient front shape. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Experiments of {{directional}} solidification in a Hele-Shaw cell, 240 mm x 245 mm x 1 mm, {{were carried out}} to {{study the effects of}} convective flows and the evolution of structure in the "mushy layer", consisting of fluid and crystallites. Three different concentrations of ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) solution, 26 %, 27 % and 28 %, with a constant <b>bottom</b> <b>cooling</b> temperature ranging from 5 °C to - 20 °C were used as an analogue model for metallic alloy systems. The experimental design included techniques using Peltier heat pumps along with PID feedback control for temperature regulation. A shadowgraphic visualization method made possible the simultaneous observation of the evolution of convection in the liquid region and the phenomena of chimney formation within the mushy layer. More than one hundred runs were carried out. Temperature information and simultaneously acquired digital images were recorded automatically. The time evolution of the solidification process was traced by image processing technique from the digital images. Results show that the phenomenon of intermittent plumes frequently occurs. The number of plumes near the liquid-mush interface decreases from a larger number in the beginning to about the same number of high plumes in the liquid region or chimneys in the mush. The number of chimneys is more static than that of plumes due to the relatively low speed of solidification or dissolution. The mush consists of three different layers. A thin layer of generally upward oriented crystal forms rapidly in the beginning, followed by a second layer aggregate gradually covering it. Finally a third layer of dendritic crystals dominates the top of the growing mush. Preliminary experiments in a Hele-Shaw cell inclined at 21 degrees caused the mush structures to develop differently than in the normal geometry. The significant differences include the dendritic crystal form, the lacunae of the mush, the shape of the chimneys, and the porosity changes of the structures.

40|$|The {{presentation}} {{addresses the}} alternative assembly of power semiconductors (IGBTs and diodes) with direct liquid cooling {{from the top}} and bottom side. The technology extends the current carrying capability of semiconductors significantly by reducing the thermal resistance between semiconductors and cooling liquid. Especially in the case of converters employed for propulsion in cars, the innovation will reduce the system cost and increase assembly lifetime. Particular challenges in this type of assembly are thermal-mechanical reliability, the low thermal resistance and the difficulty of designing the required production processes. High-voltage resistance, power supply and the sealing of cooling ducts have to be solved as well. Investigations include today's problems with conventionally soldered and heavy wire bonded power modules as well as some alternative assembly possibilities which are currently under discussion or being tested, respectively. The concept of contacting semiconductors between two substrates (e. g. DCBs) with cooling from both sides will be discussed in detail. The demonstrator shown in this presentation is used to establish the technology's viability and its estimated characteristics, particularly in terms of lifetime. It comprises a half bridge with two IGBTs and diodes, which are soldered onto DCBs on both sides. Through the additional thermal dissipation on the upper surface, static thermal resistance is reduced by 40 % compared to one-sided cooling assemblies. Dynamic thermal resistance is also significantly reduced through the thermal mass of the second DCB. The main challenges of contacting semiconductors quality-like between two substrates with top and <b>bottom</b> <b>cooling</b> liquid are the availability of semiconductors for soldering or sintering from both sides with optimized pad layout, adjusted DCB layout as well as encapsulation technologies to achieve appropriate insulation capability, the assembly technology and the sealing of cooling ducts.

40|$|In the {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} dissertation the knowledge of directional solidification of eutectic Al-Si alloy has been summarized. Different methods of directional solidification and buoyancy driven convection have been described. The mechanism of crystallisation of anomalous eutectics and the mathematical model of growth of anomalous eutectics derived from the basic of theoretical assumptions have been introduced. The types of individual silicon crystals formed during directional crystallisation under different conditions and effect of modification with strontium have been described. Vertical Bridgman-Stockbarger directional solidification apparatus with <b>bottom</b> <b>cooling</b> was used. The furnace motion velocity could be adjusted from 0, 83 to 427 m/s. The growth velocity and temperature gradient during directional solidification for two different apparatus modifications were determined. In the apparatus with a movable cooler the temperature gradient was constant and growth velocity didn't much deviate from furnace motion velocity. In the apparatus with a fixed cooler the growth velocity and temperature gradient changed during directional solidification. Temperature gradient in this modification was {{in the range of}} 20 - 50 K/cm and growth velocity in the range of 1 - 480 m/s. The eutectic alloy Al-Si 12, 6 was prepared. The effect of conditions of directional solidification on the structure of this alloy was studied using the image analysis. The size and interparticle spacing of silicon particles decrease with decreasing G/V ratio. The structure shows relatively good directionality at high G/V ratio because the growth of suitable silicon particles is promoted and the growth of the others is suppressed. The effect of growth velocity at constant temperature gradient on growth interface was studied. The growth interface is rough in Al-Si alloys. Silicon crystals form leading phase and there is a depression of growth interface between silicon crystals. The roughness is higher with increasing growth velocity up to certain value. When the growth velocity exceeds a defined level, where the rough silicon crystals are formed, the growth interface become smoother. The samples of eutectic Al-Si alloy for mechanical tests were prepared by directional solidification. The hardness, ultimate strength and ductility increase with increasing growth velocity at constant temperature gradient. Eutectic Al-Si alloy was modified by 0, 05 wt% of strontium. The effect of directional solidification conditions on the modification of structure of this alloy was observed. Strontium has no strong effect on the Al-Si alloy structure whether the G/V ratio is higher than 5. 108 K. s/m 2. When the ratio is lower the flake silicon crystals change to very fine circular silicon fibre crystals and the mechanical properties of the alloy are better. It is evident that strontium inhibits growth of silicon flakes.

40|$|For {{the case}} of {{solidification}} of a <b>bottom</b> <b>cooled</b> binary alloy, the magnetohydrodynamic stationary and oscillatory convective stability in the mushy layer is investigated analytically using normal mode linear stability analysis. In the limit of large Stefan number (S-t), a near-eutectic approximation with large far field temperature is considered in the present research. To ascertain the instability in the mushy layer, {{the strength of the}} superimposed magnetic field is so chosen that it corresponds to a given mush Hartmann number (Ha(m)) of the problem. The results are presented for various values of mush Hartmann numbers in the range, 0 <= Ha(m) <= 50. The critical Rayleigh number for stationary convection shows a linear relationship with increasing Ha(m). The magnetohydrodynamic effect imparts a stabilizing influence during stationary convection. In comparison to that of the stationary convective mode, the oscillatory mode appears to be critically susceptible at higher values of beta (beta=S-t/(sic) (2) Y- 2, (sic) is the compositional ratio, Y= 1 +S-t/(sic)), and vice versa for lower beta values. Analogous to the behavior for stationary convection, the magnetic field also offers a stabilizing effect in oscillatory convection and thus influences global stability of the mushy layer. Increasing magnetic strength shows reduction in the wavenumber and in the number of rolls formed in the mushy layer. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
