50|$|Otiorhynchus (often spelt Otiorrhynchus) {{is a large}} genus of weevils in {{the family}} Curculionidae. Many species of the genus, {{particularly}} the <b>black</b> <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> (O. sulcatus) and the strawberry root weevil (O. ovatus), are important pests, both as larvae and as adults. Larvae feed on plant roots. Adults are flightless with fused elytra and feed at night on plant foliage. In many species of the genus at least some races are polyploid and parthenogenetic, {{while the rest of}} the races and species are diploid and bisexual. Otiorhynchus weevils, particularly O. scaber, have been a popular subject for studies of the evolution of parthenogenesis. The genus is native to the Palearctic region. However, sixteen species were inadvertently introduced to North America and have become widespread there.A number of species are troglobites, cave-dwelling animals that lack eyes.|$|E

40|$|Over the {{previous}} quarter century the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Otiorhynchus sulcatus) {{has become a}} pest of horticultural and agricultural plants. The <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> is a polyphagous coleopteran insect {{and is able to}} attack over one hundred different plant species. Its spread has been limited by its lack of flight but modern world trade in live container grown plants has spread the insect to new habitats. Damage to plants caused by <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> is two fold, with the larvae destroying root balls while the adults attack the, leaves. The larval stage, in particular is difficult to treat with conventional insecticides unless environmentally undesirable soil treatments are used. The current lack of defence against the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> has opened the door for methods of crop protection through the generation of genetically modified plants. The design of an efficient GM approach to control the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> requires a sound knowledge of the insect’s digestive enzymes, which may be used as potential targets for insecticidal proteins. This approach was achieved for the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> through analysis of active digestive proteases in the insects gut and the identification of suitable proteinase inhibitors which would reduce the overall level of protein hydrolysis. Using this method it was discovered that the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> contained both serine and cysteine proteases in addition to a range of other digestive hydrolases. This biochemical data was supported by a molecular approach to isolate cDNA clones associated with the insect's digestive tract. Using a gut specific cDNA library clones encoding a cathepsin B protease, two trypsin proteases, a pectinesterase, a lipase and a cellulase were isolated and characterised. The cellulase isolated from <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> has been shown to originate from the insect genome as shown through Southern Blot analysis and sequencing across several intronic regions. Evidence presented herein shows that the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> gut extract hydrolyses both cellulose and cellobiose. Similar results were observed with recombinant protein expressed in the eukaryotic yeast P. pastoris. Furthermore data presented here shows that the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> has the full complement of enzymes needed for the complete digestion of crystalline cellulose, which was until recently believed to be the sole domain of several species of bacteria and yeast. In addition a cDNA clone encoded a <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> endogenous chitinase was isolated from the cDNA library. This chitinase cDNA and one encoding the proteinase inhibitor Oryzacystatin-I were used to generate transgenic tobacco plants which have been shown to express the transgene.

40|$|BACKGROUND:Vine weevil (Otiorhynchus sulcatus) {{is a major}} pest of {{soft fruit}} and {{ornamental}} crops. There is an urgent need to improve control of <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> and in particular to provide growers with effective Integrated Pest Management-compatible controls with which to target the adult stage of this pest. One approach would be to exploit the behaviour of adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> to disseminate spores of an entomopathogenic fungus placed within the crop environment in artificial refuges. To be effective this approach requires that the weevils move through the crop environment {{and in doing so}} spread the pathogen from the artificial refuges. OBJECTIVE:Use passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to study the movement of adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> within crop environments. METHOD:A series of laboratory bioassays were completed in which the effect of attaching RFID tags using a thermoplastic or a cyanoacrylate adhesive on survival and movement, on both horizontal and vertical surfaces, of adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> was determined. An outdoor field experiment was then completed at Harper Adams University in order to test the potential of this technique for studying <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> movement within crop environments.

A series of experiments was conducted to determine oviposition and host plant interactions under conditions of choice and absence of choice of host plant. It was found that oviposition was greatest for Yew, followed by polyanthus, fushcia, strawberry and (despite the name) was found to be least on vine plants. Variation was attributed to a combination mainly of ground cover and partially quality of host. Oviposition was found to be much lower under conditions of absence of choice. Variation was attributed to the observation that not all <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> oviposit all the time and that feeding and oviposition upon a plant are independent. A further experiment conducted using strawberry plants with variable leaf N reinforced the interpretation that feeding and oviposition are independent functions. Under conditions of choice of host plant it was found that feeding occurred upon plants that were not capable of generating ova. Passive transponders attached to individual <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> adults were Utilised in order to relate oviposition and feeding to specific actions of individual <b>vine</b> <b>weevil.</b> If was found that a greaterv olume of leaf matter was consumed from leaves of high N that was not associated with an increase in plant visitation. It was also found that the presence of surface refuge increases the volume of oviposition and feeding- possibly as a function of increasing the number of <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> that remain in association with the host plant. Direct measurement of leaf area consumed reinforced the observation that feeding and oviposition are not correlated.

The distribution of oviposition is highly influenced by locomotion. Traditional arena based studies suggested the high level of incidence of directional bias. In order to determine the angle of rotation and the path length an item of apparatus was designed a nd created. The AVOID apparatus enabled the measurement of path and angle without the detrimental effect of an arena wall.

40|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} (EPN) and entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) are pathogens {{which require}} an insect host to fulfil their life cycle and {{are commonly used}} as biocontrol agents. Studies have shown {{that a combination of}} EPN and EPF can result in greater insect mortality when compared to the agents applied alone. This interaction could possibly reduce the cost and quantities of single dose applications, inferring a synergistic effect. However, combinations of these pathogens may also result in additive or antagonistic interactions which would be of no benefit to growers. Hylobius abietis (large pine weevil) and Otiorhynchus sulcatus (<b>black</b> <b>vine</b> <b>weevil)</b> cause economic damage to forestry and horticultural crops, respectively. Large pine weevil larvae develop in the tree stumps, emerge as adults and feed on the bark of newly planted saplings, causing extensive mortality. <b>Black</b> <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae kill plants by feeding on the roots and adults cause cosmetic damage. In this investigation, laboratory and field trials were conducted against large pine weevil larvae to determine whether interactions occur if EPN and EPF were applied simultaneously. EPN and EPF have already been shown to interact synergistically against the vine weevil in laboratory conditions. These experiments were repeated to investigate if synergistic interactions could be reproduced. Synergistic interactions were found with EPN and EPF against the large pine weevil in some laboratory experiments. However, antagonism and additivity were also recorded and synergism could not be predictably achieved. The field trial against the large pine weevil resulted in additivity. This indicates that the combined application of EPN and EPF would not be a better option than single applications.

Assessment of reproductive performance shows that the host-plant range of the adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> Otiorhynchus sulcatus in Europe is limited to one gymnosperm genus (Taxus sp.) and {{a broad range of}} angiosperm plants in two subclasses of the Dicotyledonae, namely Dilleniidae and Rosidae. The successful reproduction on very distantly related plant taxa suggests that the original weevil- and plant-habitat has mediated the current host-plant range of the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil.</b> Contact-preference tests with equally suitable hosts, such as Aronia, Fragaria, Euonymus and Taxus, and one less suitable host, Humulus, indicate a mismatch between contact preference and performance and, as far as olfactory preferences are known, these match neither the contact preferences nor the performance. This mismatch may arise because (i) host plant species offered do not occur in weevil habitat in Europe (e. g. Aronia and the cultivated Fragaria come from North America) and (ii) predation (or disease) risks differ among host plants, thereby altering effective reproductive performance. With respect to performance on novel hosts (Thuja, Prunus) and bad hosts (Rhododendron), some between-individual variation is found within a single population, suggesting that local populations harbour (possibly genetic) variation for adaptation to new hosts.

40|$|A Y-tube {{olfactometer}} and a still-air olfactometer {{were developed}} to determine the attractiveness of several host plants for the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Otiorhynchus sulcatus (F.); Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Odours of weevil-damaged yew (Taxus baccata) and spindle trees (Euonymus fortunei) are attractive to the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil,</b> but Rhododendron and strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) are not. Undamaged Euonymus is attractive to the weevils in springtime but not in late summer. When clean air or undamaged Euonymus is the alternative, weevils strongly prefer weevil-damaged Euonymus foliage, and this preference is retained throughout the year. Hence, plant damage {{plays a role in}} attraction of the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil.</b> In contrast to the permanent attractiveness of weevil-damaged Euonymus, mechanically damaged plants gradually lose the attractiveness that they have early in the growing season. This suggests that emission of volatiles, produced by the plants in response to weevil damage, is important for attraction of the weevils because the weevils may use these plant odours to find suitable food plants throughout the season. Apart from weevil-damage-related plant volatiles, green leaf volatiles must also play a significant role, as indicated by the fact that weevils prefer: early season, undamaged Euonymus over clean air; early season, mechanically damaged Euonymus over undamaged Euonymus; and, throughout the season, had no preference when mechanically damaged Euonymus is tested against weevil-damaged Euonymus. Thus, monitoring traps may be developed by the use of green leaf volatiles and/or herbivore-induced volatiles, as attractant...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Two {{types of}} {{exogenous}} mortality factors, density-independent and density-dependent, were identified for the <b>black</b> <b>vine</b> <b>weevil,</b> Otiorhynchus sulcatus Fab., developing on container grown rhododendrons. The {{addition of the}} insecticide acephate, (O. S. - Dimethyl acetylphosphoramidothioate, Orthene®) 75 S) to the rhizosphere of rhododendrons in which larval O. sulcatus develop was categorized as a density-independent mortality factor. Acephate when applied as a drench, killed both early and late instar larvae. The mode of entry was primarily contact. Application of acephate drenches to control early instar (I-III) larvae prevents fatal injury (girdling) to container grown rhododendrons. A life table was constructed for the <b>black</b> <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> on container grown rhododendrons at three densities (beginning with 25, 75, and 150 eggs per plant) {{in the process of}} identifying mortality factors. The greatest mortality occurred during the first instar as the larvae become established on the root systems of host plants. At high larval densities (> 4 larvae per plant, in a 23 x 22 cm plastic container) the amount of available stem exoxylary tissue became a density-dependent mortality factor. This is because the larvae require exoxylary tissue to successfully complete development on rhododendron, although they do not feed on it prior to the fourth instar. Therefore, mortality increased with an increase in insect density because of competition for the limited amount of exoxylary tissue. The percent of stem exoxylary tissue removed (consumed) by larvae was dependent on the volume of rhododendron roots. Plants with large (1622 ± 223 ml) root volumes had significantly less (P< 0. 01) stem exoxylary tissue removed than plants with small (360 ± 265 ml) root volumes...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND:Vine weevil (Otiorhynchus sulcatus) {{is a major}} pest of {{soft fruit}} and {{ornamental}} crops. There is an urgent need to improve control of <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> and in particular to provide growers with effective Integrated Pest Management-compatible controls with which to target the adult stage of this pest. One approach would be to exploit the behaviour of adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> to disseminate spores of an entomopathogenic fungus placed within the crop environment in artificial refuges. To be effective this approach requires that the weevils move through the crop environment {{and in doing so}} spread the pathogen from the artificial refuges. OBJECTIVE:Use passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to study the movement of adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> within crop environments. METHOD:A series of laboratory bioassays were completed in which the effect of attaching RFID tags using a thermoplastic or a cyanoacrylate adhesive on survival and movement, on both horizontal and vertical surfaces, of adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> was determined. An outdoor field experiment was then completed at Harper Adams University in order to test the potential of this technique for studying <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> movement within crop environments. RESULTS:Attaching RFID tags using the thermoplastic adhesive did not result in any weevil deaths over a 21 day period. In contrast, just over half (53 %) of the weevils to which the RFID tag was attached using the cyanoacrylate adhesive died over the same period. The mean of weevil horizontal movement speed was significantly slower when an RFID tag was attached using a thermoplastic (1. 01  cm/s) or a cyanoacrylate (0. 29  cm/s) adhesive compared with untagged weevils (1. 83  cm/s). However, weevils that were tagged using the thermoplastic adhesive were significantly faster than weevils tagged using the cyanoacrylate adhesive. Mean vertical movement speed was also significantly slower when weevils were tagged using the thermoplastic adhesive (0. 18  cm/s) compared with untagged weevils (0. 37  cm/s). Weevils tagged using the cyanoacrylate adhesive were unable to climb vertical surfaces. In the field experiment, weevils moved away from their release points. Nine days after the start of the experiment weevils were on average 3. 38  m from their release points indicating a speed of movement of 0. 38  m/day. The mean distance of movement from their release points did not increase further {{during the rest of the}} experimental period, but remained relatively constant at between 2. 50 and 3. 28  m. As such, for weevils that remained within the crop environment, there is no evidence of dispersal behaviour,with movement behaviour observed more likely to be driven by resource utilisation. However, not all weevils remained within the crop area. Indeed, 15 (38 %) of released weevils and/or RFID tags left the crop area, indicating possible long range dispersal by these individuals or evidence of predation of the weevils. A total of 11 (28 %) of the RFID tagged weevils released into the crop were recovered alive and with the tag still attached after 35 days. These weevils were estimated to have moved a distances of between 2. 65 and 17. 30  m (average distance moved 7. 50  m) during this period. These distances are likely to underestimate the distance moved by each weevil as they assume that each weevil took the most direct route between each point and did not move other than this. In total eight of the RFID-tagged weevils moved both along and between rows of strawberry grow-bags. At the start of the experiment the 11 RFID tagged weevils occupied 11 (14 %) of the strawberry grow-bags. If these weevils took the most direct route between each position within the crop where they were detected these weevils would have crossed, and potentially laid eggs in, 44 (58 %) of the grow-bags during the 35 days of the experiment. If they had taken a more indirect route the weevils could have potentially laid eggs in a higher number of the grow-bags. CONCLUSIONS:Results presented here indicate that RFID tags can be used to study the movement of <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> adults within crop environments. However, the weight and size of currently available tags significantly slows the movement of weevils under laboratory conditions and frequency of detection may affect estimates of actual distance moved. Despite this, the rate at which <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> dispersed through the strawberry crop was comparable to the speed of movement recorded previously by others when weevils were released into an urban environment. Use of RFID tags also resulted in detection rates far higher than those reported in studies by others using traditional mark-release-recapture techniques. Use of RFID tags in the present study indicates that adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> have the potential to disperse spores of a suitable entomopathogenic fungus from artificial refuges throughout the crop environment. Use of this technique could also be applied to investigate the effect of other plant protection products as well as the impact of different cropping systems on <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> movement and survival...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{constraints}} of the experiments conducted <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> were found to exhibit a strategy of volume of indiscriminate oviposition rather than a strategy of definitive site selection characteristic of a true oviposition behaviour. A series of experiments was conducted to determine oviposition and host plant interactions under conditions of choice and absence of choice of host plant. It was found that oviposition was greatest tor Yew, followed by polyanthus, fushcia, strawberry and (despite the name) was found to be least on vine plants. Variation was attributed to a combination mainly of ground cover and partially quality of host. Oviposition was found to be much lower under conditions of absence of choice. Variation was attributed to the observation that not all <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> oviposit all the time and that feeding and oviposition upon a plant arc independent.
