5|$|Do I wish I {{had never}} endured post-partum depression? Absolutely. But {{to deny the}} {{experience}} is to deny who I am. I still mourn the loss of what could have been, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> feel deep gratitude for those who stood by me, for the lesson that we must never be afraid to ask for help, and for the feeling of summer that still remains.|$|E
25|$|But {{after seven}} months I {{dropped out of}} Dune, by then Rudy Wurlitzer {{had come up with}} a first-draft script which I felt was a decent {{distillation}} of Frank Herbert's. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> realised Dune was {{going to take a lot}} more work—at least two and a half years' worth. And I didn't have the heart to attack that because my older brother Frank unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis picture. Frankly, that freaked me out. So I went to Dino and told him the Dune script was his.|$|E
25|$|He {{procured}} me a Chinese interpreter, Fong Shi, {{a pleasant}} and agreeable young Chinaman, who wrote his mother-tongue with ease and spoke Jagatai Turki fluently, and—did not smoke opium. He left {{his wife and}} child behind him in Khotan, Liu Darin making himself answerable for their maintenance. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> paid Fong Shi three months' salary in advance, and that money he gave to his wife. Whenever I could find leisure he was to give me lessons in Chinese, and we began at once, even before we left Khotan...........|$|E

25|$|It is {{a matter}} of some dispute how much credit Dirichlet deserves for the modern {{definition}} of a function, in part because he restricted his definition to continuous functions....I believe Dirichlet defined the notion of continuous function {{to make it clear that}} no rule or law is required even in the case of continuous functions, not just in general. This would have deserved special emphasis because of Euler's definition of a continuous function as one given by single expression-or law. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> doubt there is sufficient evidence to settle the dispute.|$|E
25|$|I {{have the}} {{greatest}} consideration for the goals which are pursued by the physicists of the latest generation which go {{under the name of}} quantum mechanics, and I believe that this theory represents a profound level of truth, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> believe that the restriction to laws of a statistical nature {{will turn out to be}} transitory....Without doubt quantum mechanics has grasped an important fragment of the truth and will be a paragon for all future fundamental theories, for the fact that it must be deducible as a limiting case from such foundations, just as electrostatics is deducible from Maxwell's equations of the electromagnetic field or as thermodynamics is deducible from statistical mechanics.|$|E

500|$|The Narrator finds {{redemption}} {{at the end}} of {{the film}} by rejecting Tyler Durden's dialectic, a path that diverged from the novel's ending in which the Narrator is placed in a mental institution. Norton drew parallels between redemption in the film and redemption in The Graduate, indicating that the protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self. Fincher considered the novel too infatuated with Tyler Durden and changed the ending to move away from him: [...] "I wanted people to love Tyler, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> wanted them to be OK with his vanquishing." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} written and {{produced}} by Lady Gaga and RedOne. The song was originally recorded on the Tour Bus in Europe in 2010, {{and was later}} remixed at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood, California by Trevor Muzzy. Gaga said that the song was inspired {{after a night of}} partying at the Laboratory nightclub in Berlin, Germany. The next day, she wrote [...] "Scheiße", stating that she [...] "meant [...] like 'shit, it's good.' <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> meant it the other way; because this song is really about wanting to be a strong female without all the bullshit that comes along with. Anything that gets in your way from being brave. It's not the only word I know, I just like that word. It's sexy." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Hunt discussed {{working as an}} independent artist, stating [...] "Creatively it is certainly liberating, {{but the rest of}} it is really not that fun. I wanted a happy medium between the system of recording, marketing and distribution which I think is very important to any product you want to bring to market ... but I never had that with the record industry. Now that I'm {{on the other side of}} it trying to be the artist and the industry, I realize what the importance of the system was, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> realize there was a lot that was missing since it is basically dying now." [...] He also said that he intends on recording another album [...] "at least one more time and then go on tour, and then I don't know." ...|$|E
500|$|Nick Levine from Digital Spy {{felt the}} video was unique and commented that [...] "There aren't many popstars {{who could make}} a video {{featuring}} doves, balloons, a galloping horse, a giant inflatable elephant and a mass grope-fest {{in the middle of}} LA... {{and get away with it}} [...]" [...] Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly complimented its sexuality and said that the video could [...] "best described as either a makeout flash mob, a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade gone wild, or some serious [...] "the touch, the feel of cotton" [...] guerrilla marketing." [...] MuuMuse-editor Bradley Stern praised the concept of the video as [...] "incredible" [...] and complimented the inclusion of the horse. Popjustice called the music video a [...] "lovely pervoramic pop moment." [...] Due to its sexual content and nature, the music video was censored and banned in numerous Asian countries including Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. In an interview with Spanish television channel Cuatro, Minogue responded to the censorship and said: [...] "I think, yes, it's sexy <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> think it's very touching and sensual and the message is love." ...|$|E

500|$|Richard Phillips Feynman {{was born}} on May 11, 1918, in Queens, New York City, to Lucille , a homemaker, and Melville Arthur Feynman, a sales manager, {{originally}} from Minsk in Belarus, in those days part of the Russian Empire; both were Lithuanian Jews. They were not religious, and by his youth, Feynman described himself as an [...] "avowed atheist". Many years later, {{in a letter to}} Tina Levitan, declining a request for information for her book on Jewish Nobel Prize winners, he stated, [...] "To select, for approbation the peculiar elements that come from some supposedly Jewish heredity is to open the door to all kinds of nonsense on racial theory", adding, [...] "at thirteen I was not only converted to other religious views, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> stopped believing that the Jewish people are in any way 'the chosen people'. (He {{was not included in the}} book.)" [...] Later in his life, during a visit to the Jewish Theological Seminary, he encountered the Talmud for the first time and remarked that it contained a medieval kind of reasoning and was a wonderful book.|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg {{attended}} Savanna High School in Anaheim, describing {{himself as}} a [...] "band geek" [...] who played the trumpet. At age 15, he snorkeled for the first time; Hillenburg {{took part in a}} [...] "dive program" [...] at Woods Coves in Laguna Beach, California, as part of the Regional Occupational Program at Savanna. This experience, as well as subsequent dives, reinforced his interest in, and led to his decision to study, marine biology in college: [...] "The switch clicked and I decided I wanted to be a marine biologist, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> liked being an artist." [...] Some of his high-school teachers, who knew of his interest in art and fascination with the ocean, advised him otherwise, saying: [...] "You should just draw fish." [...] However, the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him and he was more riveted by [...] "making weird, little paintings". During a few summers after finishing high school, he worked as a fry cook and lobster boiler at a fast-food seafood restaurant in Maine. (This later inspired SpongeBob SquarePants' occupation in the television series, which he would begin developing in 1994.) ...|$|E
500|$|There was {{debate about}} {{the merits of the}} producer's {{decision}} to avoid depicting the two battles between the Starks and Lannisters. Ryan criticized it and confessed being [...] "a little disappointed that many of the major characters are caught up in a war and we're not seeing it." [...] Sims regretted not seeing the fight, and although he claimed to understand the budget constrictions, he felt that [...] "all this off-screen fighting is just getting my blood rushing for some on-screen fighting." [...] Sepinwall concludes: [...] "Ideally, we'd get a few epic, Braveheart-level battle scenes at some point, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> respect the demands of time and budget here. Those kinds of sequences cost a fortune, and they eat up a lot of screen time, and I think ultimately I'd have rather had the time, say, that we spent in Tyrion's tent the night before the battle, with the mortifying story of his ex-wife, and then whatever it cost to make the execution sequence look as good as it did, than for the episode to have given us one or two long fight scenes." ...|$|E

500|$|The Russian {{characters}} {{from the start}} of the episode came from a [...] "great" [...] Russian acting community in Vancouver, British Columbia who had defected from the Soviet Union. Both Lea and Laurie Holden were required to learn Russian for the first scene following the opening credits. Alex Shostak Jr., who portrayed Dmitri, worked 12–14 hours a day; make-up was applied to give the appearance that his eyes and mouth had been sewed up, and a small straw was pushed between his lips to give him water. During the filming of the episode, he was [...] "literally" [...] blind and guided by the crew members throughout the filming of his scenes. Shostak provided the translation for his own lines from English to Russian. Holden and Lea worked diligently together to perfect their lines in Russian. Holden explained, [...] "we'd come up with these fun ways to test ourselves to know if we had really nailed it. Show tunes come to mind, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> remember this one time my dialect coach had me call a Russian friend of his on his cell phone to see if he could understand me. I passed the test." ...|$|E
500|$|Marge is a caring, understanding, and {{nurturing}} parent to Bart, but {{she refers to}} him as [...] "a handful" [...] and is often embarrassed by his antics. In [...] "Marge Be Not Proud" [...] (season seven, 1995), {{she felt she was}} mothering Bart too much and started acting more distant towards him after he was caught shoplifting. In the beginning of the episode, Bart protested her [...] "over-mothering", but as she started acting more distant towards him, he felt guilty about it and made up with her. Marge has expressed understanding for her [...] "special little guy" [...] and has defended him on many occasions. She once said [...] "I know Bart can be a handful, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> know what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing... Of course, it makes him do bad things." [...] Marge has a good relationship with Lisa and the two are shown to get along quite well. Marge over-mothers Maggie, which causes her to become too clingy and dependent on Marge. In [...] "A Streetcar Named Marge" [...] (season four, 1992) When Marge was playing the role of Blanche DuBois, she hit Ned Flanders naked with a bottle and she tells him 'What's this bottle in your face!'.|$|E
500|$|During {{the latter}} half of 2005, Working Title {{approached}} several towns in South West England looking for an appropriate filming location. Pegg commented, [...] "We're both [...] from the West Country so it just seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in Frome". Stow-on-the-Wold was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon Wells in Somerset, Wright's hometown, of which he has said [...] "I love it <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> want to trash it". Wells Cathedral was digitally painted out of every shot of the cathedral city, as Wright wanted the Church of St. Cuthbert to be the centre building for the fictional town of Sandford; however, the Bishop's Palace is identifiable in some shots (and was itself used as the setting for some scenes). While shooting scenes in their uniforms, Pegg and Frost were often mistaken for genuine police officers and asked for directions by passers-by. Filming also took place at the Hendon Police College, including the driving school skid pan and athletic track. Filming commenced on 19 March 2006 and lasted for eleven weeks. After editing, Wright ended up cutting half an hour of footage from the film.|$|E
