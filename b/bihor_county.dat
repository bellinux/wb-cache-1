Between 1976 and 1986, Georgescu was in correspondence with Ion Simuţ, an aspiring critic whom the educational system of the day had assigned to a schoolteacher's position in the remote commune of Ţeţchea, <b>Bihor</b> <b>County.</b> He helped Simuţ publish his contributions in Bucharest journals, personally intervening with editors. He was in the meantime engaged in a rivalry with some main figures of the neorealist tendency, who were traditionally closer to the Ceauşescu regime: Preda, Eugen Barbu, Petru Dumitriu and Titus Popovici. During that time, he ended his collaboration with Scînteia and began contributing to România Liberă daily, which, under Octavian Paler's direction, took a certain distance from the official line. According to Manea, Georgescu's contributions to România Literară, which also hosted writers diverging from the PCR-imposed course, were [...] "never refused". He also published two other novels: Înainte de tăcere ("Before the Silence", 1975) and Doctorul Poenaru ("Doctor Poenaru", 1976), followed in 1977 by Revelion (titled after the common word for a New Year's Eve party).|$|E

Work related stress is of growing concern because it has significant economic implications for the organization. Even if some stress is a normal part of life, excessive stress can influence one's productivity, health and emotions {{and it has to be}} taken under control. When people lose confidence, they refuse to take responsibilities, they get quickly irritated, they are unsatisfied of their job, their performance will be very low and the organization will be in danger. Fortunately, most managers and entrepreneurs know which stress main symptoms are and have the necessary knowledge for managing and reducing it before it can affect employees' daily work. Stress can have an impact both on the organizational welfare and on personal behavior of supervisors or employees, that's why, the ability of managing it can make the difference between job's success or failure. The purpose of this paper is to study Romanian managers and entrepreneurs from <b>Bihor</b> <b>County's</b> perception regarding the stress phenomenon, if they feel that they are affected by stress, if they promote some methods to reduce it and if they consider that stress can influence the organizational performance.

Then, based on the ideal tourist profile, there will be a selection of countries were these potential tourists live. If the county desires to adopt this plan, there will be extensive structural modifications on all economical and educational sectors in order to obtain maximum performances. The selection of future potential investors will be crucial for the future activities of the county. If the main objective will be the construction of spas, there will be an increase demand for qualified medical staff. This knowledge can be attained only in medical universities. The courses of a medical university can be followed only by those persons that have a bio-chemistry high school profile. If the investments will be made in this sector, the number of students of the medical university and of local high schools will have to increase exponentially.

The strategy should include attracting those investors that produce goods designed for body enrichment, and not to import these products from abroad.

40|$|AbstractPorcine proliferative {{enteritis}} (PPE) is {{an important}} enteric disease and is widespread in intensive pig production. It is caused by Lawsoniaintracellularis, intracellular bacteria which affect more frequently postweaned pigs between 6 and 20 weeks of age. The aim of the study described in this paper was to obtain data on the prevalence of Lawsoniaintracellularis infections in Romanian pig herds. To realize this we used “Lawsonia FIRST test™” kit (MicroCoatBiotechnologie GmbH), a qualitative single-use test designed {{to be used for}} the detection of Lawsoniaintracelluaris in porcine feces. The samples were collected from four wean-to-finish herds from the west part of Romania, 15 samples/herd, from pigs with ages between 90 and 140 days. These herds were from different counties as it follows: Timis – 2 herds, Bihor and Hunedoara – one herd from each one. This study showed that Lawsoniaintracellularis infection percent is different between herds, varying between 0 % (herd 1 from Timiscounty) and 80 % (herd 2 from Timis county). In herds from <b>Bihor</b> and Hunedoara <b>counties</b> the infection percent was 60, respectively 46. 6 %. The results indicate that infection with Lawsoniaintracelluaris is very widespread in investigated pig herds– 46. 6 % of samples were positive – and it occurs in herds with digestive disorders and in herds without clinical symptoms...|$|R

Previous studies revealed that the northwestern part of Romania does not exhibit vegetation specific to the region of forest steppe, hills or low mountain areas, as expected. Many species common to mountainous regions were previously observed not only in Carei Plain, but also in Ier Plain, Tur Plain, Tăşnad Hills or Oaş region across Satu Mare, <b>Bihor</b> and Sălaj <b>counties.</b> The same observations were made {{in other parts of}} Carei Plain in Hungary, and conclusions were drawn that the area was a glacial refuge.

40|$|AbstractThe {{paper is}} dealing with the {{analysis}} of the enterprise risk and growth of a selected number of anonymous small and medium size enterprises. The investigation is based on the enterprises’ simplified annual financial reports. In the economic environment of our days, the principle of “no risk means no profit” is widely accepted and supported. It can also be added, if there is no profit, there is no successful growth. By using leverage ratios, below we intend to analyze two basic types of enterprise risk: financial risk and operational risk. Several publications dealing with enterprise growth are available, yet none have yet been able to offer a common approach to this problem. In our publication enterprise growth is considered as the effective growth of certain economic indicators. We investigate internal and sustainable growth rates in the period of 2010 - 2013 in a sample of enterprises registered in <b>County</b> <b>Bihor</b> and operating in different sectors of economy. In {{the second part of the}} study, the investigated firms are grouped by calculated indicators based on their 2012 year's results by the method of cluster analysis. The calculations were carried out by the R statistics program which is used in a variety of research fields and has the advantage of being an open source software system. The program can offer the modules that are required for our analysis. For our cluster analysis we applied module ‘hclust’. The results of the analysis show that there are no significant changes in the internal and sustainable growth rates of the companies over the investigated period. The minor difference identified between the internal (IGR) and sustainable growth (SGR) rates can be considered as normal, since the investigated firms were using foreign sources as well in order to finance their activities. In terms of risk indicators, it was found that of the degree of operating leverage (DOL) and the degree of financial leverage (DFL) it is the degree of operating leverage that appears to be the major source of problems for the investigated firms. Thus, risk managers should be giving priority attention to minimizing it. Our analyses show that the majority (64 %) of the enterprises have an acceptable level of risk...|$|R
