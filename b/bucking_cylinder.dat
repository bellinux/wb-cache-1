5000|$|An {{increase}} in peak magnetic field yields {{a reduction in}} both volume (higher energy density) and cost (reduced conductor length). Smaller volume means higher energy density and cost is reduced due to the decrease of the conductor length. There is an optimum value of the peak magnetic field, about 7 T in this case. If the field is increased past the optimum, further volume reductions are possible with minimal {{increase in}} cost. The limit to which the field can be increased is usually not economic but physical and {{it relates to the}} impossibility of bringing the inner legs of the toroid any closer together and still leave room for the <b>bucking</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{design has}} been {{developed}} for a high field magnet for the ARIES-I reactor design. The toroidal field magnet produces 21 T at the coil. It uses a tertiary Nb 3 Sn conductor. The combination of a high aspect ratio design, advanced magnet design, and a <b>bucking</b> <b>cylinder</b> structural design reduces toroidal field coil stress levels to- 700 MPa. The stress level could be handled in a steady-state reactor by industrially available steels. 1...|$|E
