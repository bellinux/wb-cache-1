A <b>battery</b> <b>powered</b> tram fitted with Julien's Patent Electric Traction ran in 1889 to Henley Beach. The trial was unsuccessful due to the batteries poor capacity, and the promoters' deaths in a level crossing accident shortly after precluded further experiments.|$|E
5|$|Many reticle {{illumination}} {{and pattern}} options are available. Common light sources used in firearm reflector sights include <b>battery</b> <b>powered</b> lights, fiber optic light collectors, and even tritium capsules. Some sights {{are specifically designed}} to be visible when viewed through night vision devices. The color of a sight reticle is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds. Some sights use a chevron or triangular pattern instead, to aid precision aiming and range estimation, and still others provide selectable patterns.|$|E

40|$|The {{operation}} of a <b>battery</b> <b>power</b> bank with series-connected buck–boost-type <b>battery</b> <b>power</b> modules (BPMs) was investigated in this study. Each BPM consisted of a battery pack with an associated buck–boost converter for individually controlling battery currents. With a proposed discharging scenario, load voltage regulation with charge equalization among batteries was performed by controlling the battery currents {{in accordance with their}} state-of-charges (SOCs) estimated by real-time battery-loaded voltages detected under the same operating condition. In addition, the fault tolerance was executed to isolate exhausted or faulty batteries from the <b>battery</b> <b>power</b> bank without interrupting the system operation. Experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the discharging scenario for a laboratory <b>battery</b> <b>power</b> bank with four series buck–boost BPMs...|$|R

25|$|The use of {{hydrogen}} fuel is another alternative under development in various countries, alongside, hydrogen vehicles though hydrogen {{is actually an}} energy storage medium, not a primary energy source, and consequently {{the use of a}} non-petroleum source would be required to extract the hydrogen for use. Though hydrogen is currently outperformed in terms of cost and efficiency by <b>battery</b> <b>powered</b> vehicles, there are applications where it would come in useful. Short haul ferries and very cold climates are two examples. Hydrogen fuel cells are about a third as efficient as batteries and double the efficiency of gasoline vehicles.|$|E

25|$|Headphones are {{available}} with low or high impedance (typically measured at 1kHz). Low-impedance headphones {{are in the range}} 16 to 32ohms and high-impedance headphones are about 100-600ohms. As the impedance of a pair of headphones increases, more voltage (at a given current) is required to drive it, and the loudness of the headphones for a given voltage decreases. In recent years, impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on <b>battery</b> <b>powered</b> CMOS-based portable electronics. This has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics. Consequently, newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively low output impedance.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} German Army {{versions of}} the G36 are equipped with a ZF 3×4° dual optical sight that combines a 3× magnified telescopic sight (with the main reticle designed for firing at 200 m and bullet drop compensation markings for: 200, 400, 600 and 800 m crosshairs and a range-finding scale) and an unmagnified reflex sight (calibrated for firing at 100 m) mounted {{on top of the}} telescopic sight. The reflex sight is illuminated by ambient light during the day and uses <b>battery</b> <b>powered</b> illumination for use at night. Electric illumination is activated automatically by a built in photo sensor and can be manually activated to boost the brightness of the reticle in daytime low contrast situations.|$|E
25|$|The Black Shark torpedo offers {{fibre optic}} wire for {{increased}} bandwidth and signal processing ability compared to copper wire guided torpedo types. The sonar capability include non-doppler shifted target discrimination and multi-frequency capability that features advanced spatial and angular analysis abilities. The design {{goal for the}} torpedo was 300% improvement of passive acquisition and 200% active acquisition with its sonar system. The brushless motor design coupled with the aluminum-silver oxide (Al-AgO) battery gives the system a top speed 50+ knot, {{and a range of}} 50km, performance envelope. Like all other <b>battery</b> <b>powered</b> HWTs, the battery power system does not suffer the loss of performance of Otto fuel II types at greater depths since there is no exhaust to deal with at greater pressures. The result is a 150% improvement in speed and 200% in torpedo endurance.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, milk-buying {{patterns}} have changed drastically in the UK. The classic milkman, who travels his local milk round (route) using a milk float (often <b>battery</b> <b>powered)</b> {{during the early}} hours and delivers milk in 1 pint glass bottles with aluminium foil tops directly to households, has almost disappeared. Two {{of the main reasons}} for the decline of UK home deliveries by milkmen are household refrigerators (which lessen the need for daily milk deliveries) and private car usage (which has increased supermarket shopping). Another factor is that it is cheaper to purchase milk from a supermarket than from home delivery. In 1996, more than 2.5 billion liters of milk were still being delivered by milkmen, but by 2006 only 637 million liters (13% of milk consumed) was delivered by some 9,500 milkmen. By 2010, the estimated number of milkmen had dropped to 6,000. Assuming that delivery per milkman is {{the same as it was}} in 2006, this means milkmen deliveries now only account for 6–7% of all milk consumed by UK households (6.7 billion liters in 2008/2009).|$|E
40|$|Internet {{streaming}} {{applications are}} becoming increasingly popular on mobile devices. However, receiving streaming services on mobile devices is often constrained by their limited <b>battery</b> <b>power</b> supply. Various techniques have been proposed to save <b>battery</b> <b>power</b> consumption on mobile devices, mainly focusing on how much data to transmit and how to transmit. In this paper, we conduct an experiment-based study with 11 Internet streaming applications using different streaming protocols. Our goal is to empirically investigate the <b>battery</b> <b>power</b> consumption on the wireless network interface for receiving streaming data via different approaches. Through measurement and analysis, we find that (1) the Chunk-based streaming is widely used in practice and it is most power-efficient because the traffic shaping technique is adopted to utilize PSM on mobile devices to save <b>battery</b> <b>power</b> consumption; however, it may cause quality degradation from time to time; (2) reducing streaming data transmission (by switching to a lower streaming quality) can marginally help save <b>battery</b> <b>power</b> consumption in RTSP, Pseudo streaming, and Chunk-basedstreaming applications; but it is effective for P 2 P streaming applications; (3) P 2 P streaming to mobile devices is not power-efficient because of the additional transmission of control traffic and uploading traffic; and reducing upload alone does not help for <b>battery</b> <b>power</b> saving. Our investigation provides new insights and some guidelines for the current Internet mobile streaming services and calls for further research on more power-efficient and scalable Internet mobile streaming protocols...|$|R
