5|$|In 1999, Oliver Ford Davies {{starred in}} Ben Brown's play Larkin With Women at the Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough, reprising his {{role at the}} Orange Tree Theatre, London in 2006. The play was {{published}} by Larkin's usual publishers, Faber and Faber. Set in the three decades after Larkin's arrival in Hull, it explores his long relationships with Monica Jones, Maeve Brennan and Betty Mackereth. Another Larkin inspired entertainment, devised and starring Sir Tom Courtenay, was given a pre-production performance {{on the afternoon of}} Saturday 29 June 2002 at Hull University's Middleton Hall. Courtenay performed his one-man play Pretending to <b>Be</b> <b>Me</b> as part of the Second Hull International Conference on the Work of Philip Larkin. In November that year, Courtenay debuted the play at the West Yorkshire Playhouse, later transferring the production to the Comedy Theatre in London's West End.|$|E

This is the biggest thrill apart from my 1981 Test selection in England and helping bring back the Sheffield Shield to NSW last year.|$|E

(1995) and Who Wants To <b>Be</b> <b>Me?</b> (2000), are written in the conversational or anecdotal style of his host chats. The former book follows a year (19941995) in his life recalling his personal life, his memories with celebrities, and work on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, among other things. The latter book {{was a response to}} the success of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and deals with the show and his life. In 2011, upon leaving Live!, Philbin released a memoir titled How I Got This Way.|$|E
25|$|Press reports at {{the time}} claimed that a ferocious fight erupted over Williams' successor. Williams' {{resignation}} came just 15 days before the Teamster convention, at which a successor {{would have to be}} elected. In addition to Presser, other candidates for the presidency were reported to <b>be</b> <b>M.E.</b> (Andy) Anderson, president of the statewide Teamsters organization in California; Joseph Morgan, president of the Teamsters in Florida; Don Peters, president of the large Teamsters local in Chicago; and Ray Schoessling, secretary-treasurer of the international Teamsters union and a Williams appointee. The press reported that Presser had formed an alliance with Anderson, which gave him enough votes to win the presidency.|$|E

500|$|With Gallup's {{departure}} from the Cure and Smith's work with Siouxsie and the Banshees, rumours spread that the Cure had broken up.

500|$|Writing in 1910, at a {{time when}} Romanian art came to <b>be</b> <b>me</b> more {{familiar}} with new artistic trends (including Cubism and Fauvism, both advocated locally by art critic Theodor Cornel), Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești adapted his discourse to the new trends. The art patron, who probably exercised considerable influence over Cornel, publicly complained that, instead of keeping up with the times, his fellow Romanian intellectuals still regarded Impressionism as the ultimate novelty. On the occasion, he hailed the Post-Impressionist French artists Paul Gauguin and Paul Cézanne as the models to follow. He was actively seeking to mend his split with Luchian, and, although he called the painter [...] "inconsistent", again stated that he found him to be Romania's best young artist.|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics {{allude to}} his {{supposed}} relationship with Mariah Carey, the music video for [...] "Obsessed", and pictures and proof {{he claims to}} have of the couple.

Now I'm pissed off," [...] before describing Carey's impersonation of him in her video, [...] "Oh gee, is that supposed to <b>be</b> <b>me</b> in the video with the goatee?/ Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out." [...] Eminem continues describing a near-sexual encounter with the singer, threatening to release voice-mails and pictures he still has in his possession. Additionally, the song features a females voice, unknown whether or not Carey's, where she calls herself Mary Poppins, as well as several intervals of her laughter.|$|E

So that all <b>is</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>is</b> administered unto <b>me.</b> The rest, that <b>is</b> not <b>me,</b> <b>is</b> nothing, it is something which is nothing. So the Italian, through centuries, has avoided our Northern purposive industry, because it has seemed to him a form of nothingness.|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the same publication, Ne-Yo explained how he wrote the lyrics, [...] "I'm listening to the track, and all I can see is Rihanna and some random person sitting across from each other at the table with a gun sitting {{in the middle of the}} table and playing Russian roulette." [...] Ne-Yo further stated that Rihanna is not afraid to trying new things and from the first moment she heard the song he knew she would like it, [...] "I trust Rihanna to be Rihanna, and she trusts me to <b>be</b> <b>me.</b> That's the coolest thing about our relationship. I must say this song is a step in somewhat of a different direction for both of us." [...] When Harmony heard the song, both he and Ne-Yo were aware that they should change some elements and that it had to be darker and edgier.|$|E
500|$|These insults {{culminated in}} an altercation {{between the two}} on March 16, 2003, at Pride 25.

It's gonna <b>be</b> <b>me</b> and you." [...] Silva immediately {{jumped to his feet}} and made his way into the ring. He was now face-to-face with Jackson, who continued by saying, [...] "You have my belt, you're keeping it warm for me." [...] Silva responded by yelling [...] "MY BELT!" [...] and giving Jackson a forceful shove. Jackson, visibly upset, advanced towards Silva as dozens of Pride officials intervened. Jackson stood still as he was surrounded by officials, while Silva had to be constantly restrained from charging at Jackson. Jackson later stated that he was instructed by Pride executives to make these comments. He added that Silva's shove infuriated him, and he was ready to fight Silva immediately.|$|E

I'm just gonna <b>be</b> <b>me,</b> because that's what you guys love the most, and that's what makes me feel best. Just being normal, normal for me is Loud! Sassy, fun, flirty, energetic." [...] While Rihanna was filming Battleship, she explained {{in an interview with}} Entertainment Tonight, [...] "Loud is, the word, the name of the album definitely reflects the attitude of it, it's really sassy and flirty and it grabs your attention and that's why I enjoy it.

500|$|Originally it wasn't {{going to}} have {{anything}} to do with that, but people were looking through my photo albums this year.

I guess everybody was like, 'How would you feel about this type of concept ?'

500|$|Arular {{takes its}} title from the {{political}} code name employed by M.I.A.'s father, Arul Pragasam, during his involvement with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, popularly known as the Tamil Tigers; she contends that her father's [...] "revolutionary ideals" [...] are the album's thematic base.

500|$|The {{album was}} titled after the {{recurring}} theme {{of water in}} songs such as [...] "Diving for Hearts" [...] and [...] "I Would Like to Call It Beauty", while the music was said by Rae to possess [...] "a kind of tidal movement to it too, {{in the way that}} we recorded the songs. You know, sometimes it would just <b>be</b> <b>me</b> and my guitar. Then we'd really sort of swell up into these big arrangements, only to then retreat back to it just being me and my guitar again." [...] According to Chris Mugan from The Independent, The Sea was a departure from the polished sound of Rae's debut album, while Paste magazine's Steve Labate said Rae expanded on her debut's mix of contemporary R and older soul music by incorporating pop rock, singer-songwriter influences, and occasional elements of bossa nova and trip hop. In the opinion of Craig McLean from The Daily Telegraph, the record's music evoked Simone's singing and the 1968 Van Morrison album Astral Weeks.|$|E
