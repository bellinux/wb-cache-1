He communicates telepathically with Alex and the other creatures through the nectar but he appears only in Execution. He is over 300 years old - was born in Hungary in the 18th century - and he's survived so long because of the Stranger's <b>blood,</b> the <b>base</b> <b>product</b> of the nectar. When he was a boy, he was framed for murdering his younger brother József - the real killer was the Stranger - and was crucified by the townspeople; instead of death he choose the Stranger's offer - he received immortality through the Stranger's blood. For centuries, he traveled across Europe, creating soldiers with his nectar {{in order to make a}} world where there's only strength and equality. However, Furnace isn't in control of his actions but the Stranger. In Execution he finally dies and is replaced by Alex.Theme Statement:People may make unjust decisions [...]|$|R
40|$|A {{small group}} of people {{belonging}} to a certain religion, called Jehovah′s witness do not accept blood transfusion or <b>blood</b> <b>products,</b> <b>based</b> on biblical readings. When such group of people are in need of health care, their faith and belief is an obstacle for their proper treatment, and poses legal, ethical and medical challenges for attending health care provider. Due to the rapid growth in the membership of this group worldwide, physicians attending hospitals should be prepared to manage such patients. Appropriate management of such patients entails understanding of ethical and legal issues involved, providing meticulous medical management, use of prohaemostatic agents, essential interventions and techniques to reduce blood loss and hence, reduce the risk of subsequent need for blood transfusion. An extensive literature search was performed using search engines such as Google scholar, PubMed, MEDLINE, science journals and textbooks using keywords like ′Jehovah′s witness′, ′blood haemodilution′, ′blood salvage′ and ′blood substitutes′...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study the scaling up of bionsecticide production from Bacillus thuringiensisvar. israelensisusing onggok (a cassava by-product) as a carbon source. The insecticide produced was used to eradicate Aedes aegypti larvae. The product was a crystal protein produced during bacterial sporulation. Scaling up from laboratory to pilot plant scale was done using two methods, i. e. constant agitation power per unit volume (Pg/V) and constant oxygen transfer coefficient (kLa). The results showed that yield of product per substrate (Yp/s) of Pg/V <b>based</b> <b>product</b> with the value of 3. 52 ± 0. 02 spora per gram substrates was higher than Yp/s of kLa <b>based</b> <b>product</b> with the value of 2. 96 spora per gram substrate. Logarithmic value of viable spore count (log of VSC) was also higher, i. e. 7. 23 ± 0. 30 for Pg/V <b>based</b> <b>product</b> as compared to 7. 17 ± 0. 20 for kLa <b>based</b> <b>product.</b> Substrate efficiency was also higher in Pg/V based (92. 47 %) than kLa based (64. 87 %). LC 50 of Pg/V <b>based</b> <b>product</b> was lower (0. 49 μg/ml) meaning that it was more toxic than kLa <b>based</b> <b>product</b> (0. 62 μg/ml). Amino acid content of Pg/V <b>based</b> <b>product</b> was also higher than kLa <b>based</b> <b>product.</b> Constant Pg/V method was suggested as a based on the scaling up of bioinsecticide production of B. thuringiensis israe/ensison industrial scal...|$|R

Various alternative models are considered: a monopoly model, a model of brand rivalry with full consumer information and a model of rivalry in which consumers are only well informed about <b>base</b> <b>product</b> prices. Only the brand rivalry model with limited consumer information predicts that premium products have larger percentage markups than <b>base</b> <b>products,</b> provided that brand rivalry is sufficiently intense. Empirical evidence on <b>base</b> and premium <b>product</b> pricing in the automobile market is consistent with the limited information model and inconsistent with the other two models. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Regular {{structures}} such as PLA's {{are very}} important to reduce VLSI design time. Interest in CAD tools such as a practical reducing PLA generator is high. This dissertation presents PRONTO as a practical, near-optimal product term reduction method, whose general heuristic approach consists of the following four steps. First, select a <b>base</b> <b>product</b> term. Second, find for the <b>base</b> <b>product</b> term a set of expandable directions; so that when the base is expanded, it can cover "most" of the uncovered product terms. Third, expand the <b>base</b> <b>product</b> term in *hose previously found directions to find a "best" expanded product term. Fourth, update the state of the uncovered product terms affected by the inclusion of the expanded <b>base</b> <b>product</b> term in the solution. These four steps are repeated until no product terms are left uncovered. Results of eight examples (including one with 235 terms, 12 inputs and 25 outputs) show that PRONTO gives up to 21...|$|R

However, Kodak, Canon, Nikon, and HP all adopted the SD (Secure Digital) memory card. Despite the common practice of multiple standards, there is lack of knowledge on how technological compatibility affects consumer purchase decisions on <b>base</b> <b>products</b> and add-ons at the brand and/or standard level. We recognize the existence of multiple standards and develop a dynamic model in which a consumer makes periodic purchase decisions on whether to adopt/replace a <b>base</b> <b>product</b> and/or an add-on product. We {{take into account the}} dynamic and interactive inventory effect by allowing consumers to recognize the long-term financial implications when forward-planning in switching to a <b>base</b> <b>product</b> that is incompatible with the inventory of memory cards they have accumulated. Applying the model to consumer purchase history of digital cameras and memory cards from 2000 to 2004, we demonstrate compatibility makes consumer purchase decisions of <b>base</b> and addon <b>products</b> inter-temporally interdependent. Inventory of add-ons significantly affects purchases of <b>base</b> <b>products.</b> Our model explains the sales trends of the major brands of cameras and quantifies how much promotion to offer consumers in order to switch standards...|$|R
