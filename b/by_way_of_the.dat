5|$|A {{significant}} {{influx of}} population and economic activity occurred around the 1850s goldrushes, particularly the Kiandra rush of 1859–60. The goldrushes prompted {{the establishment of}} communication between Sydney and the region <b>by</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cobb & Co coaches, which transported mail and passengers. The first post offices opened in Ginninderra in 1859 and at Lanyon the following year. Bushranger activity continued with the goldrushes: Australian-born bandits Ben Hall and the Clarke brothers were active in the area, targeting mail coaches and gold transportation.|$|E

5|$|The bobcat is {{believed}} to have evolved from the Eurasian lynx, which crossed into North America <b>by</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bering Land Bridge during the Pleistocene, with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago. The first wave moved into the southern portion of North America, which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers. This population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago. A second population arrived from Asia and settled in the north, developing into the modern Canada lynx. Hybridization between the bobcat and the Canada lynx may sometimes occur.|$|E

5|$|According to Citizenship and Immigration Canada, {{there are}} three main classifications for immigrants: Family class (persons closely related to Canadian residents), Economic class (admitted {{on the basis of}} a point system that {{accounts}} for age, health and labour-market skills required for cost effectively inducting the immigrants into Canada's labour market) and Refugee class (those seeking protection by applying to remain in the country <b>by</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadian immigration and refugee law). In 2008, there were 65,567 immigrants in the family class, 21,860 refugees, and 149,072 economic immigrants amongst the 247,243 total immigrants to the country. Canada resettles over one in 10 of the world's refugees and has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{introduction}} of the Bagnall locomotives and the traffic generated by the works at Waddesdon Manor had boosted the route's fortunes, it remained in serious financial difficulty. The only connection with the national railway network was <b>by</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turntable at Quainton Road. The 3rd Duke of Buckingham chaired the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway but its management regarded the Tramway as a nuisance. In the 1870s it charged disproportionately high fees for through traffic between the Tramway and the main line with the intention of forcing the Tramway out of business. Relations deteriorated between Jones and J.G. Rowe, Secretary and Traffic Manager of the A The A's trains at Quainton Road would miss connections with the Tramway, causing milk shipped to Quainton to become unsellable, to the extent that Jones began unloading milk at Waddesdon and shipping it to Aylesbury by road. Although Jones asked the Duke to intervene relations remained poor; in 1888 Rowe blocked the telegraph along the Tramway, and in one meeting Jones and Rowe threatened violence.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the 19th century most of the European {{settlements}} were related to the fur trade. The largest of these settlements were trading posts established by the North West Company, particularly those at Sandy Lake, Leech Lake, and Fond du Lac. Historian Grace Lee Nute has documented over 100 fur trading posts of varying sizes in the Minnesota area before statehood. Most of these posts were eventually taken over by the American Fur Company. When several hundred settlers abandoned the Red River Colony in the 1820s, they entered the United States <b>by</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red River Valley, instead of moving to eastern Canada or returning to Europe, adding to the Minnesota region's population.|$|E

5|$|In 1885, Bradford, Harpurhey, Rusholme {{and parts}} of Moss Side and Withington townships {{became part of the}} City of Manchester. In 1889, the city became a county borough as did many larger Lancashire towns, and {{therefore}} not governed by Lancashire County Council. Between 1890 and 1933, more areas were added to the city which had been administered by Lancashire County Council, including former villages such as Burnage, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Didsbury, Fallowfield, Levenshulme, Longsight, and Withington. In 1931, the Cheshire civil parishes of Baguley, Northenden and Northen Etchells from the south of the River Mersey were added. In 1974, <b>by</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Local Government Act 1972, the City of Manchester became a metropolitan district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. That year, Ringway, the town where the Manchester Airport is located, was added to the City.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, the New York State Legislature created Route8-a, an {{unsigned}} legislative route connecting legislative Route8 in {{the center}} of Oxford to the Relief Corps Home <b>by</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east bank of the Chenango River. The Route8-a designation was removed in 1921 as part of a partial renumbering of New York's legislative routes. Its former routing became part of NY220, a new route extending from Smithville Flats to Oxford, in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY220 was rerouted near Oxford in 1982 to follow a new bridge over the Chenango River. The realignment created a short overlap with NY12 on North Canal Street between the former routing of NY220 on Main Street and the new river crossing to the north. The route was truncated from the New York State Veterans' Home at Oxford to NY12 in Oxford by January2017.|$|E
