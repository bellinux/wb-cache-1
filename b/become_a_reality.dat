5|$|In {{the decade}} {{between the end}} of the Star Trek {{television}} series and the film, many of the futuristic technologies that appeared on the show—electronic doors that open automatically, hypodermic injections, talking computers, weapons that stun rather than kill, and personal communication devices—had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>reality.</b> Roddenberry had insisted that the technology aboard the Enterprise be grounded in established science and scientific theories. The Motion Picture likewise received technical consultation from NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at California Institute of Technology, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as individuals such as a former astronaut and the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov.|$|E

25|$|The role of hazzanim as a {{respected}} full-time profession has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>reality</b> in recent centuries. In {{the last two}} centuries Jews in a number of European communities, notably Germany and Britain, came to view professionally trained hazzanim as clergy and the hazzan as the deputy rabbi. After the enlightenment, when European nations gave full citizenship and civil rights to Jews, professionally trained hazzanim were accepted by the secular governments as clergy {{in the same way as}} rabbis.|$|E

25|$|William Downey (14 July 1829 in South Shields – 7 July 1915 in Kensington), {{who came}} to be known as the Queen's Photographer, was born in King Street in South Shields, a decade before {{commercial}} photography had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>reality.</b> William, initially, was a carpenter and boatbuilder, but in about 1855 he set up a studio in South Shields with his brother Daniel and later established branches in Blyth, Morpeth and Newcastle. Their first Royal commission was to provide photographs for Queen Victoria of the Hartley Colliery Disaster in January 1862. Daniel Downey is his brother (1831 – 15 July 1881).|$|E
25|$|Nearly 10 {{years would}} elapse before the idea, given impetus by World War I, would <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>reality.</b> The new Naval Base was {{aided by the}} {{improvements}} remaining from the Exposition, the strategic location at Sewell's Point on Hampton Roads, and {{the large amount of}} vacant land in the area. The coal piers and storage yards of the Virginian Railway (VGN), built by William N. Page and Henry H. Rogers, and completed in 1909, was immediately adjacent to the Exposition site. The well-engineered VGN was a valuable link directly to the bituminous coal of southern West Virginia, which the Navy strongly preferred for its steam-powered ships.|$|E

The Lyttelton road tunnel would soon <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>reality,</b> providing a much more convenient road link between Lyttelton Harbour and the Canterbury Plains. This was expected to enable the growth of road transport as a serious competitor to the railways for the custom of passengers, and concerns were expressed that given this state of affairs, a new station for Lyttelton could not be justified. Despite this, the Minister of Railways John McAlpine announced on 7 August 1962 that the Cabinet had approved a redevelopment of the railway facilities at Lyttelton.|$|E
25|$|Wilson then remembers about Amelia's father, Lawrence; a drunk who {{has been}} overprotective of his {{daughter}} since her mother died. Lawrence hated Wilson, fearing that he will take away his daughter some day. After arriving at the river, Wilson recalls many summers he spent here, along with Amelia and Frank Dodd. The three often discussed their future, with Wilson and Frank both wanting to become pilots, and Amelia wanting to dance on Broadway. Years later Amelia asks Wilson to do the honorable thing and marry her, but fears what her father will do {{to him when he}} found out. Wilson is surprised about her request, as he always thought that she would never marry him, but he is determined to make her dream <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>reality.</b>|$|E
25|$|In August 2009 {{the club}} {{announced}} plans for wholesale development of the stadium and regeneration throughout the area. The club declared that the city of Plymouth would be submitting an application to the Football Association (the FA) to be a host venue for England's 2018 FIFA World Cup Bid. The eye-catching plans were {{released to the public}} on 14 December 2009, two days before the FA would announce which candidates they had selected for the bid. The plans, designed by Populous, include developing the stadium into a 46,000 capacity all-seater area, with a 5,000-seat indoor facility and hotel built into the complex, at a cost of at least £50m. The build would be done in three stages. The First Phase, a new Mayflower Stand, will <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>reality</b> regardless of the bid, increasing the capacity to 27,000. The Second Phase, an additional 8,000 seats, and the Third Phase, an additional 11,000 seats, would be completed by the 2014–15 season should Plymouth's application and England's bid be successful, giving the stadium a capacity of 46,000 all-seated by this stage.|$|E

25|$|The Kriegsmarine—Luftwaffe {{conflict}} continued {{along the}} same lines as before over the course of 1937 and 1938. Göring did not openly reject the claims of the navy, nor did he deny the importance of air power in sea warfare, which gave him plenty of latitude in discussions. Göring continued to show willingness to cooperate, but only in matters that the Luftwaffe could profit from the suggestions and research of the Kriegsmarine. He ordered the dismemberment of naval–air activities and organisations at his own discretion and according to his own plans. The position of the navy became weaker. Göring had been named Hitler's deputy for the Four Year Plan and he was now in a position to govern all policy concerning the allocation of aerial resources. Under those circumstances it appears Raeder and the navy accepted that a naval air arm was not going to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>reality.</b> The final confirmation of how the air and sea arms were to interact was decided at a conference on 27 February 1939 and ratified by a memorandum drawn up by Karl Bodenschatz (adjutant to Göring) signed by Göring and Raeder. The former would retain all control over naval air units and operational control would be exercised by a Luftwaffe officer assigned to the Kriegsmarine.|$|E
25|$|Whilst Australia's {{reasons for}} the {{exchange}} of diplomatic missions were known, it was also understood that the Soviet government believed at first that the exchange would serve no great purpose, due to the minimal ties {{between the two countries}}, commercial or otherwise. Both countries acknowledged that if relations, particularly trade relations, were to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>reality</b> that diplomatic relations would be required as a formality. Evatt began negotiations with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov in London in May 1942, and the 10 October 1942 agreement between the two countries to exchange diplomatic representatives was regarded in Australia as a diplomatic coup; given the Soviet Union's position as a great power in the Pacific region. The first diplomatic representatives were Andrey Vlasov for the Soviet Union, and William Slater for Australia. Between August and November/December 1942, Handley Page Hampdens of the 455th Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force were based near Murmansk in the Soviet North, where they were involved in protecting convoys bringing supplies to the Soviet Union against attacks by Nazi Germany. Slater opened the Australian Legation in Kuybyshev, the temporary seat of the Soviet government, on 2 January 1943, and moved to Moscow on 12 August 1943. Vlasov arrived in Canberra on 5 March 1943 to head the Soviet Legation, and presented his Letters of Credence to Governor-General Lord Gowrie on 10 March 1943 at Government House. The Soviet Legation in Canberra was upgraded to Embassy status on 12 July 1945 and the Australian Legation in Moscow was upgraded on 16 February 1948.|$|E
500|$|The cycle-chain scene became popular, {{with people}} telling Varma that they broke a cycle chain after seeing Siva; the {{director}} called them the [...] "ultimate {{example of how}} imagination can take over and <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>reality</b> in time". As of 2014, the chain used in the film is owned by Chakravarthy. Film-poster designers Anil and Bhanu said that posters should be designed to make a subconscious impact on the viewer, citing the title logo of Siva (with Nagarjuna and the cycle chain) as an example. Inspired by Varma's work in Siva, Rajamouli composed the action sequence during the intermission of his directorial debut Student No. 1 (2002), and followed the shot division of the cycle-chain scene for the same.|$|E
