The first series of experiments was performed to measure the extract yields obtained with pure CO 2 and with the added entrainer (ethanol). The yield increased more than twice after increasing the extraction pressure from 15 to 25 MPa. Further increase to 35 MPa was less effective. The effect of the entrainer was not significant in most cases. Palmitic (13. 1 – 16. 1 %), oleic (13. 4 – 23. 8 %), linoleic (33. 8 – 48. 4 %) and linolenic (8. 8 – 16. 3 %) acids were dominant in all extracted oils. Further experiments involved the use of enzyme. In this case the first extractor was loaded with ground borage seeds, the second one was filled with the enzyme. The total yield obtained at 15, 25 and 35 MPa was (8. 8 ± 0. 2), (23. 6 ± 0. 2) and (28. 9 ± 1. 1) %, respectively. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) of fatty acid ethyl esters showed that the content of esters was higher in the extract obtained in one extractor system at 15 MPa, compared to 35 MPa.

40|$|Recently, borage (<b>Borago</b> <b>officinalis</b> <b>L.</b> Boraginaceae) {{has been}} the subject of {{increasing}} agricultural interest because of the potential market for gamma linolenic acid (GLA), an unusual fatty acid extracted from the oil seed. GLA is an omega- 6 essential fatty acid which has been identified as having several beneficial properties. Increased interest in production of the crop in western Canada has brought about a need for ad-equate agronomic management practices since very little local research information was available. Field studies were conducted in central Alberta in 1998 and 1999 on a black Malmo silt loam soil to evaluate the effects of planting date and nitrogen fertility level on borage seed yield, harvest index, and seed oil GLA content. Plots from all possible combinations of two planting dates (early vs late) and four nitrogen fertility rates (0, 20, 40, and 80 kg N/ha) were established and arranged in a factorial randomized complete block design. Plots were harvested twice during each growing season. In general, early planting resulted in significantly higher seed yield, and harvest index. Nitrogen fertility level had no significant effect on seed yield; while increasing nitrogen fertility rate tended to decrease the harvest index. The no-response to nitrogen could be the result of a high initial soil nitrogen content. Results indicate that, under the conditions of the experiment, early seeding is recommended. Althoug...|$|E
