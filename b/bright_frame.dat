He explains that [...] "when we look at the actual conditions of this world through the camera's lens, we must deny the random movements of the human eye and restrain the eye's constant movements in order to focus on one point.

60|$|The {{subject of}} this {{dialogue}} and of these concluding remarks, which were uttered {{in a tone of}} philosophical meditation, was, as the reader will have divined, no other than Barnaby, who, with his flag in hand, stood sentry in the little patch of sunlight at the distant door, or walked to and fro outside, singing softly to himself; and keeping time to the music of some clear church bells. Whether he stood still, leaning with both hands on the flagstaff, or, bearing it upon his shoulder, paced slowly up and down, the careful arrangement of his poor dress, and his erect and lofty bearing, showed how high a sense he had of the great importance of his trust, and how happy and how proud it made him. To Hugh and his companion, who lay in a dark corner of the gloomy shed, he, and the sunlight, and the peaceful Sabbath sound to which he made response, seemed like a <b>bright</b> picture <b>framed</b> by the door, and set off by the stable's blackness. The whole formed such a contrast to themselves, as they lay wallowing, like some obscene animals, in their squalor and wickedness on the two heaps of straw, that for a few moments they looked on without speaking, and felt almost ashamed.|$|R
5000|$|A {{sculpture}} by artist Carmit Gil continues {{the theme of}} buses and suicide bombings. Gil participated in the 2003 Venice Biennale, where her work was exhibited in the Central Pavilion. Gil's Bus, 2002 {{appears to be a}} series of randomly placed bright red poles dispersed over a white open space. However, Gils' minimalist sculpture is in fact, an interpretation of a bus skeleton. The viewer has no clue this was a vehicle of public transportation and the poles are the fragmented remains of a bus is encouraged to climb up the stairs. Soon, the viewer realizes the <b>bright</b> red climbing <b>frame</b> was a bus's floor and railings - the remains of a suicide bombing. Gil set out to show that the bus's remains, much like human remains, are cleaned up immediately after [...] "the event", leaving no indication as to what has happened.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the use of}} type Ic Super Luminous Supernovae (SLSN Ic) as standardizable can-dles and distance indicators. Their appeal as cosmological probes stems from their remarkable peak luminosities, hot blackbody temperatures and <b>bright</b> rest <b>frame</b> ultra-violet emission. We present a sample of sixteen published SLSN, from redshifts 0. 1 to 1. 2 and calculate accurate K−corrections to determine uniform magnitudes in two synthetic rest frame filter band-passes with central wavelengths at 400 nm and 520 nm. At 400 nm, we find an encouragingly low scatter in their uncorrected, raw mean magnitudes with M(400) = − 21. 86 ± 0. 35 mag for the full sample of sixteen objects. We {{investigate the}} correlation between their decline rates and peak magnitude and find that the brighter events appear to decline more slowly. In a similar manner to the Phillips relation for type Ia SNe, we define a ∆M 20 decline relation. This correlates peak magnitude and decline over 20 days and can reduce the scatter in standardized peak magnitudes to ± 0. 22 mag. We further show that M(400) {{appears to have a}} strong color dependence. Redder objects are fainter and also become redder faster. Using this peak magnitude- color evolution relation, a surprisingly low scatter of between ± 0. 08 mag and ± 0. 13 mag can be found in peak magnitudes, depending on sample selection. However we caution that only eight to ten objects currently have enough data to test this peak magnitude- color evolution relation. We conclude that SLSN Ic are promising distance indicators in the high redshift Universe in regimes beyond those possible with SNe Ia. Although the empirical relationships are encouraging, the unknown progenitor systems, how they may evolve with redshift, and the uncertain explosion physics are of some concern. The two major measurement uncertainties are the limited numbers of low redshift, well studied, objects available to test these relationships and internal dust extinction in the host galaxies.

40|$|The {{theory of}} “prospect and refuge” seeks to {{describe}} why certain environments feel secure and thereby meet basic human psychological needs. Environments that meet such needs will often provide {{people with the}} capacity to observe (prospect) without being seen (refuge). Since its original proposition in 1975, prospect-refuge theory has been discussed and debated by art historians and philosophers and {{it has also been}} put into practice by landscape designers. However, it wasn’t until 1991, when Grant Hildebrand applied this theory to the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, that designers became more aware of, and interested in, this theory. One reason for this interest is that Hildebrand expanded the theory to add several additional spatial dimensions to the concept of prospect, including a love of complexity, exploration and opportunity. Hildebrand identifies that prospect and refuge may result intuitively in the work of an architect who seeks to control the manner in which open and <b>bright</b> spaces are <b>framed</b> spatially. He also applied a variation of the theory to analyse ceiling heights, the size of terraces, and the spatial complexity of a design. While prospect-refuge theory has since been widely used to interpret a range of architects’ works, relatively little evidence is available to support its application. After more than two decades of use, scholars still do not know which elements of a design shape the presence of prospect and refuge or whether they are independent factors or are mutually dependent on each other. However, one of the primary impediments to the detailed analysis and testing of prospect-refuge theory is the lack of an accepted definition. Thus, the present paper sets out to construct a critical definition of prospect and refuge theory, drawing on the body of past research that was undertaken originally in art theory and landscape design and later in architectural and interior desig...|$|R

Yes, she must have had talent, and miniatures always had a certain back-watered cachet of their own, little subject to the currents of competition on aesthetic Change. Soames opened the drawing-room door. The room was dusted, the furniture uncovered, the curtains drawn back, precisely as if his aunts still dwelt there patiently waiting.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of information disclosure in environmental policy raises questions of whether and how provision of information motivates changes in behavior. Accurate assessment {{of the value of}} information provision in reducing environmental risks requires understanding how actors respond to risk information. Chapter two examines the effects of disclosure of information on risk perception, knowledge about risks, and actions to mitigate risk from arsenic in private drinking well water. We conduct an experiment where we manipulate how information about the health risks posed by arsenic in drinking water is presented to users of private wells. This {{is one of the first}} field experiments to look at framing effects for long-term, latent environmental health risks. In contrast to much of the existing literature, we find that information frame does not affect risk perception or actions taken to address risk for low level of risk. Chapter three examines how risk perceptions are affected by variations in risk communication, specifically addressing questions raised in the field experiment. We conduct an experiment about the health risks posed by arsenic in drinking water and introduce four manipulations in communication with experimental subjects: arsenic level, information <b>framing,</b> <b>bright</b> lines and relative risk. Chapter three suggests careful consideration must be taken in designing the disclosure of moderate levels of risk to ensure that information disclosure programs effectively convey health-based recommendations. Without these considerations, information disclosure programs may unwittingly and unnecessarily heightening concern among people facing moderate levels of risk. We consider this finding especially important because a broad number of environmental and environmental health risks that are currently unregulated pose moderate levels of risk. The final chapter asks if the act of disclosing information changes the behavior of those who provide the information. Chapter four seeks to determine the degree to which information disclosure, in the form of TRI, results in improvements in environmental performance. Our work isolates the effect of information disclosure by using changes in the TRI reporting requirements to help identify the causal effect of disclosure from other potential explanations of changes in environmental performance. We find limited evidence that facilities newly reporting for a chemical have greater proportional decreases in total releases. The policy implications of Chapter 4 suggest that information disclosure should not be considered a substitute for regulation of toxic chemicals. Dissertatio...|$|R
6000|$|He {{disappeared}} {{at times}} for days, when his patient friends understood that her ladyship would naturally absorb him; {{but he always}} {{came back with the}} drollest stories of where he had been, a wonderful picture of society, and even with pretty presents that showed how in absence he thought of his home. Besides giving Mrs. Wix by his conversation a sense that they almost themselves [...] "went out," [...] he gave her a five-pound note and the history of France and an umbrella with a malachite knob, and to Maisie both chocolate-creams and story-books, besides a lovely greatcoat (which he took her out all alone to buy) and ever so many games in boxes, with printed directions, and a <b>bright</b> red <b>frame</b> for the protection of his famous photograph. The games were, as he said, to while away the evening hour; and the evening hour indeed often passed in futile attempts on Mrs. Wix's part to master what [...] "it said" [...] on the papers. When he asked the pair how they liked the games they always replied [...] "Oh immensely!" [...] but they had earnest discussions as to whether they hadn't better appeal to him frankly for aid to understand them. This was a course their delicacy shrank from; they couldn't have told exactly why, but it was a part of their tenderness for him not to let him think they had trouble. What dazzled most was his kindness to Mrs. Wix, not only the five-pound note and the [...] "not forgetting" [...] her, but the perfect consideration, as she called it with an air to which her sounding of the words gave the only grandeur Maisie was to have seen her wear save on a certain occasion hereafter to be described, an occasion when the poor lady was grander than all of them put together. He shook hands with her, he recognised her, as she said, and above all, more than once, he took her, with his stepdaughter, to the pantomime and, in the crowd, coming out, publicly gave her his arm. When he met them in sunny Piccadilly he made merry and turned and walked with them, heroically suppressing his consciousness of the stamp of his company, a heroism that--needless for Mrs. Wix to sound THOSE words--her ladyship, though a blood-relation, was little enough the woman to be capable of. Even to the hard heart of childhood there was something tragic in such elation at such humanities: it brought home to Maisie the way her humble companion had sidled and ducked through life. But it settled the question {{of the degree to which}} Sir Claude was a gentleman: he was more of one than anybody else in the world--"I don't care," [...] Mrs. Wix repeatedly remarked, [...] "whom you may meet in grand society, nor even to whom you may be contracted in marriage." [...] There were questions that Maisie never asked; so her governess was spared the embarrassment of telling her if he were more of a gentleman than papa. This was not moreover from the want of opportunity, for there were no moments between them at which the topic could be irrelevant, no subject they were going into, not even the principal dates or the auxiliary verbs, in which it was further off than the turn of the page. The answer on the winter nights to the puzzle of cards and counters and little bewildering pamphlets was just to draw up to the fire and talk about him; and if the truth must be told this edifying interchange constituted for the time the little girl's chief education.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Prest {{knew nothing}} about the papers, but she was {{interested}} in my curiosity, as she was always interested in the joys and sorrows of her friends. As we went, however, in her gondola, gliding there under the sociable hood with the <b>bright</b> Venetian picture <b>framed</b> on either side by the movable window, I could see that she was amused by my infatuation, the way my interest in the papers had become a fixed idea. [...] "One would think you expected to find in them the answer to the riddle of the universe," [...] she said; and I denied the impeachment only by replying that if I had to choose between that precious solution and a bundle of Jeffrey Aspern's letters I knew indeed which would appear to me the greater boon. She pretended to make light of his genius, and I took no pains to defend him. One doesn't defend one's god: one's god is in himself a defense. Besides, today, after his long comparative obscuration, he hangs high in the heaven of our literature, for all the world to see; he {{is a part of the}} light by which we walk. The most I said was that he was no doubt not a woman's poet: to which she rejoined aptly enough that he had been at least Miss Bordereau's. The strange thing had been for me to discover in England that she was still alive: it was as if I had been told Mrs. Siddons was, or Queen Caroline, or the famous Lady Hamilton, for it seemed to me that she belonged to a generation as extinct. [...] "Why, she must be tremendously old--at least a hundred," [...] I had said; but on coming to consider dates I saw that it was not strictly necessary that she should have exceeded by very much the common span. Nonetheless she was very far advanced in life, and her relations with Jeffrey Aspern had occurred in her early womanhood. [...] "That is her excuse," [...] said Mrs. Prest, half-sententiously and yet also somewhat as if she were ashamed of making a speech so little in the real tone of Venice. As if a woman needed an excuse for having loved the divine poet! He had been not only one of the most brilliant minds of his day (and in those years, when the century was young, there were, as everyone knows, many), but one of the most genial men and one of the handsomest.|$|R

Siapo of Nengone was by far the most promising scholar. He was a strong influence, when at home, on behalf of the Samoan teachers, and assisted in the building of a round chapel, smoothly floored, and plastered with coral lime. In 1852 he was baptized, together with three of his friends, in this chapel, in his own island, by the Bishop, in the presence of a thousand persons, and received the name of George. When the 'Border Maid' returned, though he was convalescent from a severe illness, he not only begged that he might come back, but that the young girl to whom he was betrothed might be taken to New Zealand to be trained in Christian ways. Ready consent was given, and the little Wabisane, and her companion Wasitutru (Little Chattering Bird), were brought on board, and arrayed in petticoats fashioned by the Bishop's own hands, from his own counterpane, with white skirts above, embellished with a bow of scarlet ribbon, the only piece of finery to be found in the 'Border Maid.' The Rev. William Nihill had spent the period of this trip at Nengone, and had become deeply interested in the people. The island was then thought likely to become a centre whence to work on adjacent places; but to the grief and disappointment of all, George Siapo did not live through the summer at St. John's. He had never recovered his illness at home, and rapidly declined; but his faith burnt <b>brighter</b> as his <b>frame</b> became weaker, and his heart was set on the conversion of his native country. He warmly begged Mr. Nihill to return thither, and recommended him to the protection of his friends, and he wished his own brother to become scholar at St. John's. His whole demeanour was that of a devoted Christian, and when he died, in the January of the year 1853, he might be regarded as the firstfruits of the Melanesian Church. Since Mr. Nihill was about to return to Nengone, and there was a certain leaven of Christianity in the place, the girls were not subjected to the probation of a return before baptism, but were christened Caroline and Sarah, after Mrs. Abraham and Mrs. Selwyn.|$|R
