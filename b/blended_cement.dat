25|$|Mineral {{admixtures}} {{are becoming}} more popular in recent decades. The use of recycled materials as concrete ingredients has been gaining popularity because of increasingly stringent environmental legislation, and the discovery that such materials often have complementary and valuable properties. The most conspicuous of these are fly ash, a by-product of coal-fired power plants, ground granulated blast furnace slag, a byproduct of steelmaking, and silica fume, a byproduct of industrial electric arc furnaces. The use of these materials in concrete reduces the amount of resources required, as the mineral admixtures act as a partial cement replacement. This displaces some cement production, an energetically expensive and environmentally problematic process, while {{reducing the amount of}} industrial waste that must be disposed of. Mineral admixtures can be pre-blended with the cement during its production for sale and use as a <b>blended</b> <b>cement,</b> or mixed directly with other components when the concrete is produced.|$|E

40|$|In this investigation, mortar {{specimens}} {{made with}} two plain cements, Type I and V, and <b>blended</b> <b>cements,</b> made with fly ash, silica fume, and blast furnace slag, {{were exposed to}} sodium-sulfate and magnesium-sulfate solutions. The performance of these cements, in both the environments, was evaluated by measuring expansion and determining reduction in compressive strength. The data indicate that while the performance of all <b>blended</b> <b>cements,</b> particularly those made with silica fume, was generally excellent in the Na 2 SO 4 (NSBAR) environment, their performance in the MgSO 4 (MSBAR) environment was not satisfactory. A similar trend was observed in mortar specimens made with a water-cement ratio of 0. 35. The type of cement {{did not have any}} significant influence on the performance of either plain or <b>blended</b> <b>cements</b> in both environments. The deterioration of plain and <b>blended</b> <b>cements</b> in NSBAR and MSBAR environments is attributed to the initial reaction of NSBAR and MSBAR with calcium hydroxide (CH).

The performance of these cements was evaluated through visual inspection and measurement of reduction in compressive strength. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopic techniques were used to study the sulphate attack mechanisms in plain and <b>blended</b> <b>cements</b> in both the presence and the absence of chloride ions. Results indicate that sulphate deterioration in plain cements was mitigated by the presence of chloride ions, whereas in <b>blended</b> <b>cements,</b> particularly those made with silica fume and BFS, the beneficial effect of chloride was only marginal. This is attributed to the Mg-oriented sulphate attack which was more operative in <b>blended</b> <b>cements.</b> In contrast to the gypsum and ettringite-oriented sulphate attacks, this type of attack was not inhibited in the presence of chloride ions...|$|R
5000|$|The {{benefits}} of pozzolan use in cement and concrete are threefold. First is the economic gain obtained by replacing {{a substantial part}} of the Portland cement by cheaper, pollution free, natural pozzolans or industrial by-products.

A third advantage is the increased durability of the end product.|$|E

This chemical change leads to a significant reduction of strength in structural components. In the literature {{it has been reported}} that in <b>blended</b> <b>cements,</b> because of the reduction of calcium hydroxide, magnesium sulphate ions directly react with the cementitious calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) gel and convert this into non-cementititous magnesium-silicate-hydrate (M-S-H) gel. However, in the present investigation it was observed that, in low-strength concrete (20 MPa), <b>blended</b> <b>cements</b> show more resistance than ordinarv Portland cement (OPC) because ofthe pozzolanic and dilution effect of added fly ash and slag.
