5|$|Numerous {{parasite}}s {{are known}} for this species, and both juveniles and adults often carry heavy parasite loads. Known internal parasites include the monogenean Squalonchocotyle spinacis, the tapeworms Aporhynchus norvegicus, Lacistorhynchus tenuis, and Phyllobothrium squali, and the nematodes Anisakis simplex and Hysterothylacium aduncum. Some of these parasites use the velvet belly's prey as intermediate hosts and are acquired via ingestion, while others use the shark itself as an intermediate host. The <b>barnacle</b> Anelasma squalicola, an external parasite, attaches to the shark's dorsal spine socket and penetrates deeply into the muscle, in the process often providing an attachment site for a second (and rarely a third) <b>barnacle.</b> Infestation by this <b>barnacle</b> reduces its host's fecundity by impairing {{the development of the}} reproductive organs.|$|E
5|$|Other {{barnacles}} {{found on}} fin whales include the acorn <b>barnacle</b> Coronula reginae and the stalked <b>barnacle</b> Conchoderma auritum, which attaches to Coronula or the baleen. The harpacticid copepod Balaenophilus unisetus (heavy infestations {{of which have}} been found in fin whales caught off northwestern Spain) and the ciliate Haematophagus also infest the baleen, the former feeding on the baleen itself and the latter on red blood cells.|$|E

50|$|Goose <b>barnacles</b> (order Pedunculata), {{also called}} stalked <b>barnacles</b> or {{gooseneck}} <b>barnacles,</b> are filter-feeding crustaceans that live attached to hard surfaces {{of rocks and}} flotsam in the ocean intertidal zone.|$|R
50|$|Sessilia is {{an order}} of <b>barnacles,</b> {{comprising}} the <b>barnacles</b> without stalks, or acorn <b>barnacles.</b> They form a monophyletic group and are probably derived from stalked <b>barnacles.</b> The order {{is divided into three}} suborders. Brachylepadomorpha contains a single family, Neobrachylepadidae, while Verrucomorpha contains two families, Verrucidae and Neoverrucidae. The remaining twelve families are in the suborder Balanomorpha.|$|R
25|$|The sessile {{lifestyle}} of <b>barnacles</b> makes sexual reproduction difficult, as the organisms cannot leave their shells to mate. To facilitate genetic transfer between isolated individuals, <b>barnacles</b> have extraordinarily long penises⁠. <b>Barnacles</b> probably {{have the largest}} penis to body size ratio of the animal kingdom.|$|R

5|$|Fin whales {{suffer from}} a number of {{pathological}} conditions. The parasitic copepod Pennella balaenopterae—usually found on the flank of fin whales—burrows into their blubber to feed on their blood, while the pseudo-stalked <b>barnacle</b> Xenobalanus globicipitis is generally found more often on the dorsal fin, pectoral fins, and flukes.|$|E
5000|$|The Balanomorpha are a {{suborder}} of <b>barnacles,</b> containing familiar acorn <b>barnacles</b> of the seashore. The suborder contains these families: ...|$|R
25|$|Competitors {{may include}} other <b>barnacles,</b> and disputed {{evidence}} indicates balanoid <b>barnacles</b> competitively displaced chthalamoid <b>barnacles.</b> Balanoids gained their {{advantage over the}} chthalamoids in the Oligocene, when they evolved tubular skeletons, which provide better anchorage to the substrate, {{and allow them to}} grow faster, undercutting, crushing, and smothering the latter group.|$|R
50|$|Identification of <b>barnacles</b> in {{the field}} can be challenging, and {{identification}} of particular species of Chthamalus is not considered reliable {{in the field}} other than a few species. However, a notable distinction in the arrangement of wall plates can help biologists distinguish Chthamalid <b>barnacles</b> from the other common <b>barnacles</b> in the family Balanidae. In chthamalid <b>barnacles,</b> the side plates overlap both the rostrum and the carina (the plates {{at the ends of}} the opercular opening), while in balanids one end plate (the rostrum) overlaps the adjoining side plates (rostrolaterals).|$|R
5|$|Gillan then {{formed a}} new band, simply called Gillan, {{retaining}} Towns (who would co-write {{most of the}} material), and adding guitarist Steve Byrd, bassist John McCoy and drummer Pete <b>Barnacle.</b> Byrd and <b>Barnacle</b> were quickly replaced by Bernie Tormé and by former Episode Six bandmate Mick Underwood, after Gillan saw Torme playing with his punk trio. This band had a more high powered hard rock sound, {{and the release of}} Mr. Universe in October 1979 saw Ian Gillan back in the UK charts, although the independent record company the album came out on – Acrobat Records – folded soon after the album was released, prompting a contract with Richard Branson's Virgin Records.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of birds were eaten, {{including}} swans, peafowl, quail, partridge, storks, cranes, larks, linnets and other songbirds that could be trapped in nets, and just about any other wild bird that could be hunted. Swans and peafowl were domesticated to some extent, but were only eaten by the social elite, and more praised for their fine appearance as stunning entertainment dishes, entremets, than for their meat. As today, geese and ducks had been domesticated but were not as popular as the chicken, the fowl equivalent of the pig. Curiously enough the <b>barnacle</b> goose was believed to reproduce not by laying eggs like other birds, but by growing in barnacles, and was hence considered acceptable food for fast and Lent. But at the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), Pope Innocent III explicitly prohibited the eating of <b>barnacle</b> geese during Lent, arguing that they lived and fed like ducks and so were of the same nature as other birds.|$|E

50|$|<b>Barnacles</b> are {{classified}} with shrimps, crabs, isopods and amphipods in the subphylum Crustacea. They {{are included in}} the class Maxillopoda, though this class {{does not appear to be}} a monophyletic grouping. They {{are included in the}} infraclass Cirripedia, the <b>barnacles,</b> members of which are sessile suspension feeders with two active swimming larval stages, the nauplius and the cyprid. The order Pedunculata includes <b>barnacles</b> attached to the substrate by stalks, the goose <b>barnacles.</b> The attachment is made by the cementing of the antennules of the cyprid larvae to the substrate and the elongation of that region into a stalk. Pedunculata is not itself a single monophyletic group but forms a transitional series of lineages moving towards the sessile acorn <b>barnacles.</b> Pollicipes polymerus is included in the family Pollicipedidae.|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>barnacles</b> and crabs on Caretta caretta specimens {{found in the}} waters around Italy was analysed. In the seas surrounding Italy balanomorph <b>barnacles</b> occur mainly on turtles frequenting shallow waters and crabs display a strong west-east gradient. Patterns of turtle distribution and movements are proposed. The abundance of turtle-specific <b>barnacles</b> may be dependent on, and so an indicator of, turtle density...|$|R
50|$|Some {{species of}} goose <b>barnacles</b> such as Lepas anatifera are pelagic and are most {{frequently}} found on tidewrack on oceanic coasts. Unlike most other types of <b>barnacles,</b> intertidal goose <b>barnacles</b> (e.g. Pollicipes pollicipes and Pollicipes polymerus) depend on water motion rather than the movement of their cirri for feeding, and are therefore found only on exposed or moderately exposed coasts.|$|R
5|$|Other {{recurring}} characters appear {{throughout the}} series, {{such as the}} muscular lifeguard of Goo Lagoon, Larry the Lobster; a pirate specter known as the Flying Dutchman; and retired superheroes Mermaid Man and <b>Barnacle</b> Boy, who are idolized by SpongeBob and Patrick. Most double-length episodes of the show are hosted by a live action pirate named Patchy and his pet parrot Potty, whose segments are presented in a dual narrative with the animated stories.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Barnacle</b> {{was built}} in 1950 as a First Aid centre, which quickly became a volunteer-run cottage {{hospital}} for visitors and the local community. It houses a 6-bed ward, isolation room, dental surgery, X-ray room and operating theatre. In the late 1980s the building became volunteer accommodation, until it was decommissioned in 2016 {{with the opening of}} the International Volunteer Lodge. The building now stands empty, awaiting an uncertain future.|$|E
5|$|Barnacles are {{normally}} sessile animals unable to evade predators. When they {{are attached to}} a scallop they benefit from the defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation. The scallop is disadvantaged because the presence of barnacles may reduce its ability to swim. It {{has been found that}} encrusting sponges emit chemicals that discourage <b>barnacle</b> larvae from settling nearby. The larvae preferentially settle on shells that are not encrusted with sponges. This is another way in which encrusting sponges are of advantage to the scallops which are less impeded in their ability to swim by sponges than they are by barnacles.|$|E
50|$|Gooseneck <b>barnacles</b> {{compete with}} a number of other organisms in a complex {{struggle}} for survival in the limited available space in their rocky intertidal habitat. The first colonisers of bare rock are usually annual algae, soon to be followed by perennial species including coralline algae. Gooseneck <b>barnacles,</b> sea mussels and several species of acorn <b>barnacles</b> soon follow. Further competition is provided by sea palms, the large holdfasts of which may smother or squeeze out the molluscs and <b>barnacles.</b> Sea palms may settle on the mussels and may be carried away in storms, taking the mussels with them. Gooseneck <b>barnacles</b> may limit the colonisation of mussel recruits by feeding on their larvae. In areas where gooseneck <b>barnacles</b> predominate they may dominate until some are swept away in storms and allow in other species. In the long term, the mussels usually come to dominate as their byssal threads are able to overgrow all the other sessile organisms.|$|R
40|$|The <b>barnacles</b> {{included}} in the superfamily Coronuloidea are epizoic symbionts of various marine vertebrates (including cetaceans, sirenians, and sea turtles) and other crustaceans (crabs and horseshoe crabs). Among Coronuloidea, the so-called turtle <b>barnacles</b> (Chelonibiidae) are known from Paleogene times, whereas the whale <b>barnacles</b> (Coronulidae) likely appeared in the late Pliocene (Piacenzian). Although a derivation from the turtle <b>barnacles</b> (and especially from the genus Chelonibia) has been proposed, the evolutionary origin of Coronulidae remains to date obscure. In this work we reappraise a fossil record from upper Pliocene (Piacenzian) marine deposits at Casenuove (Empoli municipality, Tuscany, Italy) comprising various shells of Chelonibia testudinaria associated to a partial skeleton of a balaenid mysticete. Based on taphonomic and morpho-functional considerations, we discuss {{the hypothesis that the}} <b>barnacles</b> were hosted on the baleen whale, possibly on its callosities, which could have represented an analogous of the horny carapace of marine turtles. This record strongly suggests that the baleen whales can be added to the list of the possible hosts of the <b>barnacles</b> of the genus Chelonibia, thus hinting that the whale <b>barnacles</b> may have evolved from an ancient phase of dispersal of Chelonibia (or a similar ancestor) on mysticete cetaceans...|$|R
40|$|Nonconsumptive {{predator}} {{effects on}} prey behaviour {{are common in}} nature, but the possible influence of prey life-history stage on such responses is poorly known. We investigated whether prey life-history stage may be a factor affecting prey feeding activity responses to predator chemical cues, for which we used dogwhelks (Nucella lapillus (L., 1758) and their main prey, <b>barnacles</b> (Semibalanus balanoides (L., 1758)), as a model system. <b>Barnacles</b> use their modified legs (cirri) to filter food from the water column. Through a manipulative laboratory experiment, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} presence of dogwhelks affects the frequency of leg swipes differently in juvenile and adult <b>barnacles.</b> Juveniles showed a similar feeding activity with and without nearby dogwhelks, but adults exhibited a significantly lower frequency of leg swipes when dogwhelks were present. Such an ontogenetic change in the response of <b>barnacles</b> to predatory cues might have evolved as a result of dogwhelks preferring adult <b>barnacles</b> over juvenile <b>barnacles,</b> as found previously. Alternatively, <b>barnacles</b> could learn to recognize predator cues as they age, as shown for other prey species. Overall, our study indicates that the nonconsumptive effects of predators on prey need to be fully understood under consideration of the possible ontogenetic changes in prey responses to predator cues...|$|R
5|$|Dyspanopeus sayi lives {{predominantly}} on muddy bottoms, {{where it}} is a predator of bivalve molluscs. In its native environment, it hides among colonies of polychaetes to avoid being preyed on by the Atlantic blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. It is an important predator of the quahog, Mercenaria mercenaria, in Narragansett Bay, and of the <b>barnacle</b> Balanus improvisus in Delaware Bay. In the Adriatic Sea, {{it has been observed}} to feed on the striped venus clam, Chamelea gallina, and the introduced Asian date mussel, Musculista senhousia.|$|E
5|$|Every spring {{over two}} million {{waterfowl}} pass Matsalu, including 10,000—20,000 Bewick's swans, 10,000 greater scaups, common goldeneyes, tufted ducks, goosanders and many others. A colony {{of up to}} 20,000 <b>barnacle</b> geese, over 10,000 greylag geese and thousands of waders stop on the coastal pastures in spring. The most numerous birds of passage (around 1.6 million) are long-tailed ducks. Approximately 35,000—40,000 ducks feed in the reedbeds in spring. In autumn, about 300,000 migratory waterfowl pass Matsalu. The wetland is the biggest autumn stopping ground of common cranes in Europe. The highest recorded number of cranes at the park has been 23,000.|$|E
5|$|Mingulay boasts {{three large}} sea stacks: Arnamul (Old Norse: Erne mound), Lianamul (Old Norse: Flax mound) and Gunamul, {{which has a}} natural arch in 150m (490ft) cliffs through which boats can sail on rare days when the restless sea is calm. There are several {{outlying}} islets including the twin rocks of Sròn a Dùin to the south-west, Geirum Mòr and Geirum Beag to the south between Mingulay and the nearby island of Berneray, and Solon Mòr ('Big Gannet'), Solon Beag ('Little Gannet'), Sgeirean nan Uibhein, <b>Barnacle</b> Rock and a smaller stack called The Red Boy, all to the north between Mingulay and Pabbay.|$|E
50|$|This {{relationship}} however is {{not truly}} commensal. While the <b>barnacles</b> {{are not directly}} parasitic to their hosts, they have negative effects to the turtles on which they choose to reside. The <b>barnacles</b> add extra weight and drag to the sea turtle, increasing the energy it needs for swimming and affecting its ability to capture prey, with the effect increasing with the quantity of <b>barnacles</b> affixed to its back.|$|R
50|$|Onchidoris bilamellata feeds {{mainly on}} acorn <b>barnacles</b> in the genera Elminius and Balanus. It uses its rachidian tooth to chew {{away at the}} top plates of the <b>barnacles</b> and then sucks out the soft body.|$|R
500|$|Having {{successfully}} completed and published the other {{books on the}} geology and zoology of the voyage, Darwin spent eight years on a major study of <b>barnacles.</b> Two volumes on Lepadidae (goose <b>barnacles)</b> were published in 1851.

5|$|Darwin's <b>barnacle</b> studies {{convinced}} him that variation arose constantly {{and not just in}} response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. He now realised that the branching pattern of evolutionary divergence was explained by natural selection working constantly to improve adaptation. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s Davis hired Ralph Munroe to oversee his Key Biscayne property. Munroe had begun visiting Biscayne Bay in 1877. He soon built a home, the <b>Barnacle,</b> on {{land on the}} {{mainland}} in Coconut Grove that he bought from John Frow, keeper of the Cape Florida Light and Fowey Rocks Light. Munroe engaged in wrecking in the waters around Key Biscayne, built sailboats, worked as a pilot for the Cape Florida Channel and opened a pineapple cannery, to which Davis sent his pineapples. Before mail service to the Miami area improved, Munroe would camp out on Key Biscayne every Tuesday evening {{so that he could}} sail out {{to the edge of the}} Gulf Stream early Wednesday morning to retrieve a package of newspapers and magazines dropped for him in waterproof pouches by a passing steamship. Munroe was also one of the founding members of the Biscayne Bay Yacht Club.|$|E
25|$|<b>Barnacles</b> were {{originally}} classified by Linnaeus and Cuvier as Mollusca, but in 1830 John Vaughan Thompson published observations showing the metamorphosis of the nauplius and cypris larvae into adult <b>barnacles,</b> and noted how these larvae {{were similar to}} those of crustaceans. In 1834 Hermann Burmeister published further information, reinterpreting these findings. The effect was to move <b>barnacles</b> from the phylum of Mollusca to Articulata, showing naturalists that detailed study was needed to reevaluate their taxonomy.|$|R
