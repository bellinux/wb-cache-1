5|$|Styloolithus, another fossil enantiornithine egg {{from the}} Gobi, differs from Gobioolithus {{in that it}} is larger and has a thicker eggshell with a proportionately smaller mammillary layer. Laevisoolithids, which are also eggs of enantiornithines, are also larger than Gobioolithus, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> much thicker mammillary layer.|$|E
5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} for treating chronic pain associated with symptoms of depression, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> risk of side effects. Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic {{low back pain}} and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not {{been shown to be}} useful in low back pain. Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in those with persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit. There are also concerns of potential side effects.|$|E

5|$|Abi starts dating Jordan, but {{months later}} he is {{attacked}} by Ben with a spanner, leaving him in a coma. They split up, but remain friends. Abi starts to {{take an interest in}} Max's lodger Darren Miller (Charlie G. Hawkins), who is left uncomfortable when she tries to kiss him, telling her she is too young and is heartbroken when Darren proposes to Jodie Gold (Kylie Babbington). Abi forms a close friendship with her mother's fiancé Greg Jessop (Stefan Booth). She later develops a crush on Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick), and the two begin dating. Believing Jay is only interested in Abi for sex, Max tries to split them up, but fails to do so. Jay and Abi plan to have sex several times, but on each occasion, they are unable to go through with it. At one time, Jay and Abi cuddle up as they are watching television, but Max believes they are about to have sex, so he throws Jay out and rips Abi's bridesmaid dress to Greg and Tanya's wedding. They go to buy a new one, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> car crash on Greg and Tanya's wedding day. They suffer minor injuries and both recover.|$|E

25|$|Ministers may be {{considered}} equal in status with the other elders, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> distinct ordination and distinct function. They are the primary preachers and teachers, celebrants of sacraments. There are sometimes further distinctions between the minister and the other elders. Some Presbyterian denominations enroll ministers as members of their respective congregations, while others enroll the minister {{as a member of}} the regional presbytery. The presbyteries are responsible for the ordination of the ministers.|$|E
25|$|To {{mitigate}} {{this lack}} of low-level radar coverage, the Air Force also operates four Plessey Tactical Mobile Radar (TMR) systems (in service with 142 Squadron SAAF). These systems can cover altitudes below 700metres, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> shorter range than the Umlindi systems, at 150km. The deployment of these systems {{require the use of}} a MAN 8×8 truck (one per system), one or two light vehicles for command and control purposes, a water tanker, a diesel bowser and a technical workshop vehicle. These systems can operate 24 hours a day with less than 20 personnel (including personnel from other AFMDW units like the Mobile Communications Unit and 501 Squadron).|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} Nirukta {{can be traced}} to the last centuries of the 2nd-millennium BCE Brahmanas layer of the Vedic texts. However, the most ancient {{complete}} surviving text of this field is a commentary on Nighantu by , who probably lived about the 5th century BCE. His text is also referred simply as Nirukta. The study of Nirukta has been closely related to the ancillary Vedic science of Vyakarana, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> different focus. Vyakarana deals with linguistic analysis to establish the exact form of words to properly express ideas, while Nirukta focuses on linguistic analysis to help establish the proper meaning of the words, given the context they are used in. Yaska asserts that the prerequisite to the study of Nirukta is the study of Vyakarana.|$|E

25|$|The {{vocal folds}} are {{located within the}} larynx {{at the top of}} the trachea. They are {{attached}} posteriorly to the arytenoid cartilages, and anteriorly to the thyroid cartilage. They are part of the glottis which includes the rima glottidis. Their outer edges are attached to muscle in the larynx while their inner edges, or margins, are free forming the opening called the rima glottidis. They are constructed from epithelium, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> few muscle fibres in them, namely the vocalis muscle which tightens the front part of the ligament near to the thyroid cartilage. They are flat triangular bands and are pearly white in color. Above both sides of the glottis are the two vestibular folds or false vocal folds which have a small sac between them.|$|E
25|$|In {{an early}} 1980s track called 'Neću da živim u Bloku 65', popular Serbian band Riblja čorba sings about a {{depressed}} individual who hates {{the world because}} he's surrounded by the concrete of New Belgrade, while a more recent local cinematic trend sees New Belgrade presented somewhat clumsily as the Serbian version of New York ghettos like those found in Harlem, Brooklyn and The Bronx. The most obvious example of the latter would be 2002 movie 1 na 1, which portrays a bunch of Serbian teenagers who rap, shoot guns, play street basketball and seem to blame many of their woes on living in New Belgrade. Other films like Apsolutnih 100 and The Wounds also implicitly paint New Belgrade in the negative light <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> more coherent {{point of view and}} place their stories {{within the context of the}} 1990s when war and international isolation truly did push some Serbs, including those inhabiting New Belgrade, to desperate acts.|$|E
25|$|The next eleven poems {{relate to}} the loves of Sulpicia and Cerinthus. Sulpicia was a Roman lady of high station and, {{according}} to Moritz Haupt's conjecture, the daughter of Valeria, Messalla's sister. The Sulpicia elegies divide into two groups. The first comprises iv. 2-6, containing ninety-four lines, in which {{the theme of the}} attachment is worked up into five graceful poems. The second, iv. 8-12, consists of Sulpicia's own letters. They are very short, only forty lines in all; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> unique interest as being the only love poems by a Roman woman that have survived. Their frank and passionate outpourings remind us of Catullus. The style and metrical handling betray a novice in poetical writing. The thirteenth poem (twenty-four lines) claims to be by Tibullus; but it is hardly more than a cento from Tibullus and Propertius. The fourteenth is a little epigram of four lines with nothing to determine its authorship. Last of all comes the epigram or fragment of Domitius Marsus already referred to.|$|E

500|$|Parsnips {{resemble}} {{carrots and}} can be used in similar ways, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sweeter taste, especially when cooked. [...] They can be baked, boiled, pureed, roasted, fried, or steamed. When used in stews, soups, and casseroles, they give a rich flavor. In some cases, parsnips are boiled and the solid portions are removed from the soup or stew, leaving behind a more subtle flavor than the whole root, and starch to thicken the dish. Roast parsnip is considered an essential part of Christmas dinner {{in some parts of the}} English-speaking world and frequently features in the traditional Sunday roast. Parsnips can also be fried or thinly sliced and made into crisps. They can be made into a wine with a taste similar to Madeira.|$|E

Paul has a shady past and Karl does not trust Paul, so Susan uses her new job to wind Karl up. Susan works closely with Paul and his reputation with the ladies gives Woodburne the opportunity to bring Susan's sadistic side. Woodburne has said that she wishes for more of that storyline as she and Dennis found it [...] "fun".
