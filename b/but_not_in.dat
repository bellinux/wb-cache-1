5|$|Energy and {{momentum}} are conserved {{only on the}} average in interactions between matter and radiation, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> elementary processes such as absorption and emission. This allows one to reconcile the discontinuously changing energy of the atom (the jump between energy states) with the continuous release of energy as radiation.|$|E
5|$|Even though plasma {{concentration}} of APOA5 is very low, {{some studies have}} focused on the analysis of the potential association of this biochemical parameter with cardiovascular disease (CVD). This relationship remains controversial, as higher plasma levels of APOA5 in individuals with CVD disease have been found in some, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> all studies.|$|E

5|$|In Muslim families, {{women and}} men are {{considered}} equal, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the westernised sense. The Quran teaches that the minds {{of males and females}} work differently and are generally different biologically. Therefore, Islam grants different rights to the husband and wife. One such right which the wife owes to her husband is being head of the household.|$|E

5|$|The {{two species}} of Seorsumuscardinus are known from {{isolated}} teeth, which show that they were medium-sized dormice with flat teeth. The teeth are all characterized by long transverse crests coupled with shorter ones. One of these crests, the anterotropid, distinguishes the two species, as it {{is present in the}} lower molars of S.alpinus, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> those of S.bolligeri. Another crest, the centroloph, reaches the outer margin of the first upper molar in S.bolligeri, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> S.alpinus. Seorsumuscardinus may be related to Muscardinus, the genus of the living hazel dormouse, which appears at about the same time, and the older Glirudinus.|$|E
