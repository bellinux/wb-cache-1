40|$|The {{appearance}} of new technologies, increase in competition, and new economic challenges {{has forced the}} organizations to implement <b>business</b> <b>processes</b> <b>re-engineering</b> projects. Successful implementation of the re-engineering project is a difficult function and depends on different key factors. The present study seeks to offer a new framework for measuring the risk level {{in the implementation of}} re-engineering projects by analyzing its critical success and failure factors. These factors were identified through reviewing the research literature and exploring the expert’s viewpoint. The framework that was offered in this study consists of five success factors and one failure one. The success factors include uniform leadership, cooperative workplace, senior management commitment, supportive management, and the use of information technologies. Also the failure factor includes resistance to change. Because this model identifies the risk level of the project failure before the implementation of re-engineering projects, it is a beneficial instrument for organizations that seek to re-engineer their <b>business</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The present paper aims {{to develop}} a {{simulation}} tool for tile manufacturing companies. The paper shows how simulation approach can be useful to support management decisions related to production scheduling and investment planning. Particularly {{the aim is to}} demonstrate the importance of an information system in tile firms. The Factory Data Model (FDM) parameter is used to describe the activities in ceramic tile industries operating in different European countries. A process- based analysis of tile manufacturers is undertaken and individual company performance is quantified by Key Performance Indicators (KPI). The overall model is composed of different processes, which are coded into Scilab environment and matched together to arrange a stochastic simulator. The simulations results are used to show how management decisions can significantly effect the KPIs. The simulations highlight the effects on KPIs of three specific parameters: the length of scheduling period, the quantity of stock needed and the reliability of the information system supporting orders. The results clearly show that the effect of allowing the presence of unattended orders within the outstanding orders list always has a remarkable negative influence on KPIs. Results also suggest that the presence of sub-groups of homogeneous tiles, based on colour variation, {{is one of the most}} important factors affecting a tile manufacturer’s performance. The results of the simulations have two different practical implications. Firstly, they demonstrate the importance of information systems in tile companies, suggest to evaluate investment in information technology and indicate the value of promoting an information culture in the entire work forces. Secondly, they show the potential of simulation tools development to support decision making in a BPR (<b>Business</b> <b>Processes</b> <b>Re-engineering)</b> scenario...|$|R

40|$|It {{is common}} in {{practice}} that many companies build complex and highly delicate <b>business</b> <b>processes</b> around their legacy (existing software) systems making it extremely difficult and costly to switch software systems or to change their <b>business</b> <b>processes.</b> Software <b>re-engineering</b> is an approach that takes legacy software that has become expensive to maintain or whose implementation is obsolete, and reconstructs it with current software technologies. The software re-engineering approach is important for recovering and reusing existing software assets, putting high software maintenance costs under control, and establishing a base for future software development. Top Hat, Inc. started developing its demand-response transportation software in 1994. Today, it is {{a vital part of}} their business. Unfortunately, it has become increasingly expensive to enhance its features and compete against their competitors. The design structure, code organization, and development platform of the legacy system make it difficult to debug, modify, and distribute to the end-user community.

This is particularly true in the world of business where globalization, advances in technology, and increased competition at home and abroad have created a hostile and turbulent environment for most organizations. Change has become a mantra – change (improve) or die. Motivations for change have been customer satisfaction, cost reduction, improved efficiency, improved quality, or, in extreme cases, survival.

40|$|Abstract. The {{definition}} or {{redesign of}} Public Administration (PA) procedures is particularly challenging. This is, for example, {{due to the}} requirement of cooperation of different organizational units and actors, different laws and procedures {{for the production of}} several artifacts, and maintaining traceability while integrating processes with new laws. We are interested in <b>business</b> <b>process</b> modeling and <b>re-engineering</b> (BPR) for PA, where ICT can play a pivotal role by, e. g., improving communication among law-makers and process analysts. With regard to this previously we developed a tool called VLPM 1. The tool is designed to provide assistance in BPR for PA, which allows traceability between laws and processes. In this paper, we discuss the extension of the tool and of its methodology to support an integrated environment {{that can be used for}} better law and process re-design by performing formal analysis on the processes. We discuss its system components and provide a working example taken from the Italian Immigration law, as a proof of concept. ...|$|R
