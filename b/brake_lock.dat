50|$|To make a rim <b>brake</b> <b>lock</b> {{the wheel}} as firmly as {{possible}} {{a number of}} techniques are used. The most common is where the braking surface of the rim is roughened using an angle grinder. This creates what trials riders refer to as a ground rim. Rim grinds can vary from quite light where the rim surface is very slightly roughened, {{all the way to}} a 'harsh' grind, where the rim has deep grooves (Heading for 1 mm deep if very harsh) in it. A grind may be referred to as 'dead' if it has been used a lot and the brake pads have started to polish it back smooth. Depending on the weather conditions and the brake pad compound chosen, different levels of grind are required for peak brake performance. Ground rims give consistent lock and hold in all but the muddiest conditions, making them more popular in wetter climates than smooth rims.|$|E
40|$|Six {{months prior}} to {{shipment}} of the Broadband X-ray Telescope to the Kennedy Space Center for flight aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia, a major system failure occurred. During modal survey testing of the telescope's gimbal pointing system, the roll axis brake unexpectedly released. Low level vibration and static preloads present during the modal survey were within the expected flight environment. Brake release during shuttle liftoff or ascent was an unacceptable risk to mission success; thus, a <b>Brake</b> <b>Lock</b> Mechanism (BLM) was developed...|$|E
40|$|Today, one of {{the largest}} areas of {{research}} and development in the automobile industry is road safety. Many deaths and injuries occur every year on public roads from accidents that technology could have been used to prevent. The latest vehicles sold boast many safety features that have helped to lower the number of accidents on the roads. These include seatbelts, crumple zones, Anti <b>Brake</b> <b>Lock</b> Systems (ABS), air bags, traction control, Electronic stability control (ESC), traction control, etc. These technologies have benefited from the large advances made in computer and electronic technology {{in the past few years}} to become cheaper, more robust and reliable. As such, it is predicted that many more safety technologies will be developed for use in vehicles of the future. Legislation, consumer needs, and other factors will only serve to increase the need for these devices. For this project, an investigation into {{one of the}}se safety systems was performed. This project consists of the research and development of an algorithm for an automotive system to detect when the vehicle drifts out of lane, or when th...|$|E

5000|$|Earnhardt {{admitted}} {{that he was to}} blame for the collision with Kahne on lap 476. He said was anxious to pass him and was underneath him when he made the maneuver but his rear <b>brakes</b> <b>locked</b> which caused him to spin. Kahne thought Earnhardt was driving too hard in turn three: [...] "I guess I need to get somebody on radio to preach to me to have more patience because I definitely can't take control of myself." [...] After retiring from the race, Schrader said of his collision with Ragan, [...] "I moved him earlier because you can't run like that two laps down. Got back around him and he paid me back for moving him, but he was two laps down." [...] Ragan denied intentionally wrecking Schrader, saying that he over-drove his car going into the first corner and his <b>brakes</b> <b>locked.</b> Stewart saw Ragan's lap-447 spin (which caused Kyle Busch to collide with the wall), and believed that NASCAR should have disqualified Ragan from the race.|$|R

50|$|Reverted rubber {{aquaplaning}} frequently follows {{an encounter}} with dynamic aquaplaning, during which time the pilot may have the <b>brakes</b> <b>locked</b> {{in an attempt to}} slow the aircraft. Eventually the aircraft slows enough to where the tires make contact with the runway surface and the aircraft begins to skid. The remedy for this type of aquaplane is for the pilot to release the brakes and allow the wheels to spin up and apply moderate braking. Reverted rubber aquaplaning is insidious in that the pilot may not know when it begins, and it can persist to very slow groundspeeds (20 knots or less).|$|R
5000|$|In 2003 Shimano {{introduced}} [...] "Dual Control" [...] to mountain bikes, {{where the}} gear shift mechanism is {{integrated into the}} brake levers. This development was controversial, {{as the use of}} Dual Control integrated shifting for hydraulic disc brakes required using Shimano hydraulic disc <b>brakes,</b> <b>locking</b> competitors out of the premium end of the market. However, with their 2007 product line, Shimano moved back to making separate braking and shifting components fully available in addition to the integrated [...] "Dual Control" [...] components, a move to satisfy riders that wished to use Shimano shifting with other brands of disc brakes.|$|R
50|$|A {{line lock}} is {{a device that}} allows the front <b>brakes</b> to <b>lock</b> {{independently}} of the rear brakes via a switch. The device is an electric solenoid that controls a valve which allows the brakes to be controlled individually, this allows the front <b>brakes</b> to be <b>locked</b> and the rear brakes to be open. This allows the driver to spin the rear wheels without wasting the rear brakes. This method {{is referred to as}} line lock and is popular among enthusiasts who like to do burnouts frequently.|$|R

50|$|Testing {{is done on}} {{an engine}} which is not running, and {{normally}} with the tested cylinder at top dead center on compression, although testing can be done at other points in the compression and power stroke. Pressure is fed into a cylinder via the spark plug hole and the flow, which represents any leakage from the cylinder, is measured. Leak-down tests tend to rotate the engine, and often require some method of holding the crankshaft in the proper position for each tested cylinder. This {{can be as simple}} as a breaker bar on a crankshaft bolt in an automatic transmission vehicle, or leaving a manual transmission vehicle in a low gear with the parking <b>brake</b> <b>locked.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{disc lock}} is a {{portable}} security device for motorcycles and scooters. Disc-locks use {{the holes in}} a motorcycle's or scooter's <b>brake</b> disc.

When in place, the disc-lock discourages theft by blocking the vehicle from being moved in either forward or reverse direction.|$|R
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. During first practice on Friday morning, Lewis Hamilton posted the fastest time– over a second quicker than the fastest time set in first practice in 2014– and four-tenths {{of a second}} ahead of his teammate Nico Rosberg in second. Both Lotus and Force India showed good pace with Romain Grosjean and Nico Hülkenberg being third and fourth fastest respectively, though over 1.5 seconds behind Hamilton.
