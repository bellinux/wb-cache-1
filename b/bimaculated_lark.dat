5|$|Lundy has {{attracted}} many vagrant birds, in particular species from North America. The island's bird list totals 317 species. This has {{included the following}} species, each of which represents the sole British record: Ancient murrelet, eastern phoebe and eastern towhee. Records of <b>bimaculated</b> <b>lark,</b> American robin and common yellowthroat were also firsts for Britain (American robin has also occurred two further times on Lundy). Veerys in 1987 and 1997 were Britain's second and fourth records, a Rüppell's warbler in 1979 was Britain's second, an eastern Bonelli's warbler in 2004 was Britain's fourth, and a black-faced bunting in 2001 Britain's third.|$|E
5000|$|M. c. gaza - Meinertzhagen, R, 1919: Originally {{described}} as a subspecies of the <b>bimaculated</b> <b>lark.</b> Found from eastern Syria and south-eastern Turkey to south-western Iran ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>bimaculated</b> <b>lark</b> (Melanocorypha bimaculata) breeds in warm {{temperate}} countries eastwards from Turkey into central Asia. It is {{the eastern}} counterpart of its relative, the calandra lark.|$|E
50|$|The {{calandra lark}} (Melanocorypha calandra) or European calandra-lark breeds in warm {{temperate}} {{countries around the}} Mediterranean and eastwards through Turkey into northern Iran and southern Russia. It is replaced further east by its relative, the <b>bimaculated</b> <b>lark.</b>|$|E
50|$|Notable {{birds in}} this {{ecoregion}} are honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus), goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), black vulture (Aegypius monachus), <b>bimaculated</b> <b>lark</b> (Melanocorypha bimaculata) and Caspian snowcock (Tetraogallus caspius). Eagles {{here are the}} lesser spotted eagle (Aquila pomarina) and the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos). The ecoregion is also a breeding area for the little bustard (Tetrax tetrax) and black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius).|$|E
50|$|The <b>bimaculated</b> <b>lark</b> {{is found}} from west-central Turkey to {{southern}} Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, north-eastern Iran and northern Afghanistan. It {{is also found}} in northern Israel, Lebanon, western Syria and northern Iraq. It is mainly migratory, wintering in northeast Africa, and ranges widely throughout the greater Middle East to Pakistan, India and Tibet. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.|$|E
5000|$|The {{calandra lark}} was {{originally}} {{placed in the}} genus Alauda. The current genus name, Melanocorypha is from Ancient Greek melas, [...] "black", and koruphos a term used by ancient writers for a now unknown bird, but here confused with korudos, [...] "lark". [...] "Calandra"' derives ultimately from kalandros the Ancient Greek name for this bird. The <b>bimaculated</b> <b>lark</b> is also sometimes termed as the calandra lark.|$|E

40|$|In July and August 2015 {{we carried}} out {{research}} on wolves Canis sp. Bos mutus around the Gyau valley, {{in the remote}} upper Humla district of north-west Nepal, which {{is located in the}} south-west corner of the Tibetan plateau, bordering the Tibetan Autonomous Region of China to the north. This area comprises alpine steppe with abundant grasses, sedges, forbs (herbaceous flowering plants) and shrubs (Salix sp., Astragalussp., etc) and the Gyau River flows through the valley where, on 5 August at 4, 872 m (30. 355 °N 81. 598 °E) we saw a bird which we did not immediately recognise and we obtained images to assist in identification. The presence of a blackish patch {{on the side of the}} lower neck/upper breast indicated two possibilities—Bimaculated Lark Melanocorypha bimaculata or Tibetan Lark M. maxima. On careful study, we observed that the bird had a long, comparatively thin bill with a pale pinkish base that turned greyer and darker towards the tip. The long-necked appearance, distinctly rufous rump and the absence of an eyestripe ruled out <b>Bimaculated</b> <b>Lark.</b> In addition, the presence of a white trailing edge to the secondaries and the white sides and broad white tips of the outer tail-feathers supported the identification as Tibetan Lark...|$|E
