60|$|He went {{round the}} {{intervening}} swamp of watercress and <b>brooklime</b> {{which had once}} been the fish-pond, crossed by a culvert the trickling brook that still flowed that way, and advanced to the wall of the house. Boisterous noises were resounding from within, and he was tempted to go round the corner, where the low windows were, and look through a chink into the room whence the sounds proceeded.|$|E
60|$|Walking {{across the}} fields for the {{distance}} of a mile or two, she came out upon the high-road by a wicket-gate. On {{the other side of}} the way was the entrance to what at first sight looked like a neglected meadow, the gate being a rotten one, without a bottom rail, and broken-down palings lying on each side. The dry hard mud of the opening was marked with several horse and cow tracks, that had been half obliterated by fifty score sheep tracks, surcharged with the tracks of a man and a dog. Beyond this geological record appeared a carriage-road, nearly grown over with grass, which Anne followed. It descended by a gentle slope, dived under dark-rinded elm and chestnut trees, and conducted her on till the hiss of a waterfall and the sound of the sea became audible, when it took a bend round a swamp of fresh watercress and <b>brooklime</b> that had once been a fish pond. Here the grey, weather-worn front of a building edged from behind the trees. It was Oxwell Hall, once the seat of a family now extinct, and of late years used as a farmhouse.|$|E

50|$|<b>Brooklime</b> was {{of three}} {{traditional}} antiscorbutic herbs, used (alongside scurvy grass and watercress) in purported remedies for scurvy.

5000|$|The Botany Gardens were {{an outdoor}} laboratory, {{the first such}} at a school in the UK, where {{subjects}} such as plant growth and pollination could be observed. Clarke encouraged her pupils {{to make their own}} books rather than use textbooks. When the ecology of plants took precedence over knowledge of 'the natural orders' in examinations, Clarke, supported by the eminent British ecologist Arthur George Tansley, created a new series of beds in her garden to replicate examples of British habitats, such as salt marsh and pebble beach. The support of William Hales, curator of Chelsea Physic Garden from 1899-1937 to Clarke is recorded in her publication, The Botany Gardens Of The James Allen's Girls' School, Dulwich: Their History And Organisation, published by the London Board of Education. Clarke describes the plants {{at the edge of the}} pond: Forget-Me-Knots, <b>Brooklime,</b> Musk, Water-Mint, Yellow Iris, Water Plantain, Arrowhead, etc. A little farther in are partially submerged plants such as Water Lilies, Floating Pondweed, and totally submerged plants such as Elodea. Some of the pond plants were given by Mr. Hales, Curator of the Chelsea Physic Garden, to whom many thanks are due for valuable help in designing the pond and in other matters. Clarke ...|$|E
