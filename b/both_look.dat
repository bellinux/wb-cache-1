5|$|Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is {{generally}} depicted standing. He wears rich clothes (generally in sculpture, only a dhoti) {{as well as}} various ornaments like a crown, armbands, necklaces etc., symbolic of royalty and the yagnopavita (sacred thread). In his eight arms, he is prescribed in the texts to carry gada (mace), sword, arrow and the Sudarshana Chakra in his left hands and shankha (conch), shield, bow and lotus in his right hands. However, in sculpture, he is often four-armed and in two of his hands, he holds a lotus and a conch, while his other hands rest on the heads of his personified weapons (ayudhapurusha) - Gadadevi or Gadanari (gada as a female) on his right and Chakrapurusha on his left, who stand as small figures besides his legs. They <b>both</b> <b>look</b> upwards towards him and hold fly whisks. A tiny figurine of the earth goddess Prithvi (who associated with Varaha and Vishnu as his consort) rises from the pedestal in between his feet, as though supporting the deity. A short dagger or sword may be tucked up in the waist belt of the god near the right hip, a peculiar feature of Kashmir icons. Attendants or devotees may be also shown besides or below Vishnu. Sometimes, Brahma and Shiva and the ten avatars of Vishnu may be depicted in the background.|$|E

It was not formally announced until now for several reasons; foremost being that we are both very private people living in the glare of the public media. We both wanted a private marriage ceremony without the distraction of a media circus. I am very much in love with Michael, I dedicate my life to being his wife. I understand and support him. We <b>both</b> <b>look</b> forward to raising a family and living happy, healthy lives together. We hope friends and fans will understand and respect our privacy." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott and Zelda {{quickly became}} celebrities of New York, {{as much for}} their wild {{behavior}} as {{for the success of}} This Side of Paradise. They were ordered to leave both the Biltmore Hotel and the Commodore Hotel for their drunkenness. Zelda once jumped into the fountain at Union Square. Another example of their behavior was when Dorothy Parker first met them, as Zelda and Scott were sitting atop a taxi. Parker said, [...] "They did <b>both</b> <b>look</b> as though they had just stepped out of the sun; their youth was striking. Everyone wanted to meet him." [...] Their social life was fueled with alcohol. Publicly, this meant little more than napping when they arrived at parties, but privately it increasingly led to bitter fights. To their delight, {{in the pages of the}} New York newspapers Zelda and Scott had become icons of youth and success—enfants terribles of the Jazz Age.|$|E

500|$|Vic Fontaine {{is first}} {{introduced}} in the episode [...] "His Way" [...] as a self-aware and romantically insightful hologram which forms {{part of a new}} Rat Pack-style Las Vegas bar program owned by Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig). Several of the main crew are present for his performance of [...] "You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You". Afterwards, Odo (René Auberjonois) seeks some advice in private from Fontaine about his feelings for Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor). The hologram helps Odo practice with another hologram that looks like Kira but does not act correctly, but Odo finds that when the real version returns to the station that they can barely interact. Fontaine transfers himself into Kira's meditation holo-program and invites her to dinner; curious, she accepts. Fontaine invites Odo back to his program, saying that the holo-Kira now acts exactly like her. The two get together in the holodeck and the date goes well until Odo reveals that he thinks that the real Kira is actually a hologram. The ruse revealed, <b>both</b> <b>look</b> accusingly at Fontaine and leave. But once outside on the promenade, the duo begin to argue, resulting in Odo kissing Kira.|$|E
500|$|While {{many of the}} {{concepts}} for the final version {{were present in the}} original mobile version, such as Overdive and the Twisted, the original story was scrapped when the game changed platforms. In creating the story for The 3rd Birthday, the team took inspiration from the 10-year gap in the character's in-game and real-time history. This meant that {{it would be difficult to}} create a straightforward sequel, so the team instead decided to make the game about Aya's return. Toriyama imagined story concepts such as the snowy New York setting and the image of a bloodstained wedding dress. These two concepts survived the platform change. Over the course of the development, he adjusted the plot numerous times to be more adult-oriented and to include complex narrative twists. The original concept was to make the game feel like a television drama, with multiple cliffhangers and moments of high drama. The game was designed from the outset as having no direct connection to the previous Parasite Eve games. The game's title came from it being Aya's third video game appearance, as well as it being a noticeable change in setting. The game's logo was designed to <b>both</b> <b>look</b> like the letter [...] "B" [...] and the number [...] "3". It was originally only going to represent the number, but Nomura added the extra lines to display the game's [...] "multi-faceted" [...] nature. A notable addition was the option to skip cutscenes, a feature the team regretted leaving out of Crisis Core.|$|E

2500|$|The Downs lie 2miles (3km) {{northwest}} of the city centre and totals [...] The Downs are divided into Clifton Down {{to the south and}} Durdham Down to the north, with a main road running between them. At the south end of Clifton Down is the Clifton Suspension Bridge, and <b>both</b> <b>look</b> over the Avon Gorge. The Downs are protected by an 1861 Act of Parliament, and are managed by the Downs Committee, a joint committee of the city council (which owns Durdham Down) and the Society of Merchant Venturers (which owns Clifton Down).|$|E
2500|$|To {{cast the}} role of Buckaroo Banzai, Richter wanted an actor who [...] "could <b>both</b> <b>look</b> heroic with grease all over his face, and project the kind of {{intelligence}} you would associate with a neurosurgeon and inventor". The studio wanted a recognizable movie star, but Richter and Canton wanted to cast a relatively unknown actor. Richter looked in New York City because he assumed that an actor with experience on stage and small films [...] "would be able to completely interact with props". He had been impressed by Peter Weller's performance in Shoot the Moon and met with him. At first, the actor was hesitant to take the role because he was unclear on the overall tone of the movie. [...] "Would it be campy? Would it be a cartoon? Or would it be the sort of wacky, realistic film that would catch people sideways—and not be a cartoon", Weller remembers thinking. Richter told him Banzai's story and convinced Weller to do the film. The actor says that he based his character on Elia Kazan, Jacques Cousteau, Albert Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, and Adam Ant.|$|E
2500|$|Manic {{states are}} always {{relative}} to the normal state of intensity of the afflicted individual; thus, already irritable patients may find themselves losing their tempers even more quickly and an academically gifted person may, during the hypomanic stage, adopt seemingly [...] "genius" [...] characteristics {{and an ability to}} perform and articulate at a level far beyond that which would be capable during euthymia. [...] A very simple indicator of a manic state would be if a heretofore clinically depressed patient suddenly becomes inordinately energetic, cheerful, aggressive, or [...] "over happy." [...] Other, often less obvious, elements of mania include delusions (generally of either grandeur or persecution, according to whether the predominant mood is euphoric or irritable), hypersensitivity, hyper vigilance, hypersexuality, hyper-religiosity, hyperactivity and impulsivity, a compulsion to over explain, (typically accompanied by pressure of speech) grandiose schemes and ideas, and a decreased need for sleep (for example, feeling rested after only 3 or 4 hours of sleep); {{in the case of the}} latter, the eyes of such patients may <b>both</b> <b>look</b> and feel abnormally [...] "wide" [...] or [...] "open," [...] rarely blinking, and this often contributing to some clinicians’ erroneous belief that these patients are under the influence of a stimulant drug, when the patient, in fact, is either not on any mind-altering substances or is actually on a depressant drug, in a misguided attempt to ward off any undesirable manic symptoms. Individuals may also engage in out-of-character behavior during the episode, such as questionable business transactions, wasteful expenditures of money (e.g., spending sprees), risky sexual activity, abuse of recreational substances, excessive gambling, reckless behavior (as [...] "speed driving" [...] or daredevil activity), abnormal social interaction (as manifest via, for example, over familiarity and conversing with strangers), or highly vocal arguments. These behaviours may increase stress in personal relationships, lead to problems at work and increase the risk of altercations with law enforcement. There is a high risk of impulsively taking part in activities potentially harmful to self and others.|$|E

2500|$|Multi-mode radar, a 3D radar is a HAL {{project with}} DRDO's LRDE as a {{subsystem}} provider. This project {{to develop an}} advanced, lightweight Multi-mode fire control radar for the LCA Tejas fighter had faced challenges and was delayed and finally superseded by a program called the Uttam to develop an AESA FCR for the Tejas LCA. The MMR program was finally completed with Elta's (Israel) assistance and became a hybrid system incorporating the original DRDO antenna, gimbal stabilization and Israeli backend. The multi-mode radar has range (for detection of a small fighter target) around 100km, can track 10 targets, can engage 2 targets and uses lightweight system. Originally, DRDO developed an all new combined signal and data processor had been developed, replacing the original separate units. The new unit is much more powerful and makes use of contemporary ADSP processors. The radar's critical hardware was also developed and validated. The software for the air-to-air mode has been developed considerably (including search and track while scan in <b>both</b> <b>look</b> up and look down modes) but air-to-ground modes were still being worked upon and proved problematic. The radar development was shown to be considerably more mature than previously thought but still faced significant delay and challenges. At Aero India 2009, {{it was revealed that}} the 3D MMR project has been superseded by the new 3D AESA FCR project led by LRDE. The MMR has been completed with Elta Israel's assistance and now involved Elta EL/M-2032 technology for Air-to-Ground mapping and targeting – in order to simplify testing, the Hybrid MMR basically became an Indian variant of the EL/M-2032 with an Indian antenna and gimbal system as Elta pointed out mixing and matching Indian hardware with Israeli software would in essence mean a new design with a significant time impact. The [...] "hybrid" [...] MMR has been tested, validated and will be supplied for the initial LCA Tejas fighters.|$|E
