5|$|The engine used {{a single}} updraft carburetor; early {{versions}} used a Stromberg unit, which {{was replaced by}} a Schebler unit. The carburetor was {{on the right side of}} the engine, the mixture went into a passage through the engine block to the intake manifold on the left side of the engine. Ignition was by Delco coil and <b>breaker</b> <b>points,</b> with the distributor at the end of the generator/starter unit.|$|E
25|$|In {{mechanically}} timed ignition systems, {{a separate}} cam in the distributor is {{geared to the}} engine and operates a set of <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> that trigger a spark at the correct time in the combustion cycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{system is}} powered by a {{lead-acid}} battery, which is charged by the car's electrical system using a dynamo or alternator. The engine operates contact <b>breaker</b> <b>points,</b> which interrupt the current to an induction coil (known as the ignition coil).|$|E

25|$|The {{ignition}} firing sequence {{begins with}} the points (or contact breaker) closed. A steady current flows from the battery, through the current-limiting resistor, through the primary coil, through the closed <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> and finally back to the battery. This current produces a magnetic field within the coil's core. This magnetic field forms the energy reservoir {{that will be used}} to drive the ignition spark.|$|E
25|$|A distributor-based {{system is}} not greatly {{different}} from a magneto system except that more separate elements are involved. There are also advantages to this arrangement. For example, {{the position of the}} contact <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> relative to the engine angle can be changed a small amount dynamically, allowing the ignition timing to be automatically advanced with increasing revolutions per minute (RPM) or increased manifold vacuum, giving better efficiency and performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{of the mechanical}} system {{is the use of}} <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> to interrupt the low-voltage high-current through the primary winding of the coil; the points are subject to mechanical wear where they ride the cam to open and shut, as well as oxidation and burning at the contact surfaces from the constant sparking. They require regular adjustment to compensate for wear, and the opening of the contact breakers, which is responsible for spark timing, is subject to mechanical variations.|$|E

Zener diodes are used for voltage regulation. Early engines used contact <b>breaker</b> <b>point</b> ignition with electronic ignition becoming standard fitment on all Triumph's 750cc twins from 1979-on.|$|R

5000|$|The Rotax 447 is a {{development}} of the Rotax 377, increasing the power output from [...] to [...] by increasing the cylinder bore from 62 mm to 67.5 mm and the maximum rpm from 6500 to 6800. The modern 447 has a single breakerless, magneto capacitor-discharge ignition (CDI) system. Early (ca. 1988) models use a <b>breaker</b> <b>point</b> ignition system.|$|R
25|$|Electronic {{ignition}} (EI) solves these problems. In {{the initial}} systems, points were still used but they handled only a low current {{which was used}} to control the high primary current through a solid state switching system. Soon, however, even these contact <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> were replaced by an angular sensor of some kind - either optical, where a vaned rotor breaks a light beam, or more commonly using a Hall effect sensor, which responds to a rotating magnet mounted on the distributor shaft. The sensor output is shaped and processed by suitable circuitry, then used to trigger a switching device such as a thyristor, which switches a large current through the coil.|$|E
25|$|As {{the engine}} {{crankshaft}} turns, it also turns the distributor shaft at half the speed. In a four-stroke engine, the crankshaft turns twice for the ignition cycle. A multi-lobed cam {{is attached to}} the distributor shaft; there is one lobe for each engine cylinder. A spring-loaded rubbing block follows the lobed portions of the cam contour and controls the opening and closing of points. During most of the cycle, the rubbing block keeps the points closed to allow a current to build in the ignition coil's primary winding. As a piston reaches the top of the engine's compression cycle, the cam's lobe is high enough to cause the <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> to open. Opening the points causes the current through the primary coil to stop. Without the steady current through the primary, the magnetic field generated in the coil immediately collapses. This high rate of change of magnetic flux induces a high voltage in the coil's secondary windings that ultimately causes the spark plug's gap to arc and ignite the fuel.|$|E

50|$|The {{tensions}} of World War II {{prompted the}} United States government to begin fortifying American Samoa in 1940. United States Marines installed the two guns at Blunts Point, and another {{two on the}} east side of the harbor at <b>Breakers</b> <b>Point.</b> Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the capture of Guam shortly thereafter, American Samoa became of critical importance as the only major American base in the western Pacific, and it was further fortified in anticipation of attack. Although no attack ever came, American Samoa was a critical supply and training point for American military actions in the Pacific.|$|R
2500|$|Most {{four-stroke}} engines {{have used}} a mechanically timed electrical ignition system. The heart {{of the system is}} the distributor. The distributor contains a rotating cam driven by the engine's drive, a set of <b>breaker</b> <b>points,</b> a condenser, a rotor and a distributor cap. External to the distributor is the ignition coil, the spark plugs and wires linking the distributor to the spark plugs and ignition coil. (see diagram Below) ...|$|E
2500|$|The KR200 ran on a [...] Fichtel & Sachs forced-air (fan) cooled single {{cylinder}} two-stroke engine positioned {{in front of}} the rear wheel, just behind the passenger's seat. The engine had two sets of contact <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> and, to reverse, the engine was stopped and then restarted, going backwards. This was effected by pushing the key further in the ignition switch than normal, whether intentionally or not. One result of this was that the KR200's sequential, positive-stop transmission provided the car with the same four gear ratios available in reverse as in forward movement.|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, Prest-O-Lite made a [...] "Black Box" [...] {{ignition}} amplifier, {{intended to}} take the load off of the distributor's <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> during high r.p.m. runs, which was used by Dodge and Plymouth on their factory Super Stock Coronet and Belvedere drag racers. This amplifier was installed on the interior side of the cars' firewall, and had a duct which provided outside air to cool the unit. The rest of the system (distributor and spark plugs) remains as for the mechanical system. The lack of moving parts compared with the mechanical system leads to greater reliability and longer service intervals.|$|E

We show that, despite Maker's apparent advantage, Breaker can prevent Maker from winning until about his n^th turn. We actually prove a stronger result: that Breaker only needs to play Ï‰(t) points on his t^th turn to prevent Maker from winning until this time.

2500|$|The Model T (built {{into the}} flywheel) {{differed}} from modern implementations by not providing high voltage {{directly at the}} output; the maximum voltage produced was about 30 volts, and therefore also had to be run through the spark coil to provide high enough voltage for ignition, as described above, although the coil would not [...] "buzz" [...] continuously in this case, only going through one cycle per spark. In either case, the low voltage was switched to the appropriate spark plug by the [...] 'timer' [...] mounted {{on the front of}} the engine. This performed the equivalent function to the modern distributor, although by directing the low voltage, not the high voltage as for the distributor. The timing of the spark was adjustable by rotating this mechanism through a lever mounted on the steering column. As the precise timing of the spark depends on both the 'timer' and the trembler contacts within the coil, this is less consistent than the <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> of the later distributor. However, for the low speed and the low compression of such early engines, this imprecise timing was acceptable.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Breakers</b> <b>Point</b> Naval Guns are a {{historic}} World War II-era defensive fortification {{on the island}} of Tutuila in American Samoa. It consists of two six-inch Mark 8 Model 2 naval guns, mounted on circular concrete platforms about 200 feet above sea level at the end of Papatele Ridge, which flanks the east side of Pago Pago Harbor. The guns, manufactured in 1907, were emplaced in 1941 amid fears of a Japanese invasion of the island, and were left in situ (albeit disabled) after invasion fears subsided. They were brought to the site by an innovative railway system that used locally-crafted rails fashioned out of ifil wood when steel rails were not available. [...] The guns are located on private family-owned land, but may be hiked to with permission.|$|R

50|$|The {{distributor}} also {{houses the}} centrifugal advance unit: {{a set of}} hinged weights attached to the distributor shaft, that cause the <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> mounting plate to slightly rotate and advance the spark timing with higher engine revolutions per minute (rpm). In addition, the distributor has a vacuum advance unit that advances the timing even further {{as a function of}} the vacuum in the inlet manifold. Usually there is also a capacitor attached to the distributor. The capacitor is connected parallel to the <b>breaker</b> <b>points,</b> to suppress sparking to prevent excessive wear of the points.|$|E

5000|$|A {{spark plug}} gap gauge is a disc with a sloping edge, or with round wires of precise diameters, and is {{used to measure the}} gap. Use of a feeler gauge with flat blades instead of round wires, as is used on {{distributor}} points or valve lash, will give erroneous results, due to the shape of spark plug electrodes. The simplest gauges are a collection of keys of various thicknesses which match the desired gaps and the gap is adjusted until the key fits snugly. With current engine technology, universally incorporating solid state ignition systems and computerized fuel injection, the gaps used are larger on average than in the era of carburetors and <b>breaker</b> <b>point</b> distributors, to the extent that spark plug gauges from that era cannot always measure the required gaps of current cars. [...] Vehicles using compressed natural gas generally require narrower gaps than vehicles using gasoline.|$|R
