The propulsion plant consists of two Caterpillar diesel engines, with a total power of 5060 kW (over 5520 bhp), and controllable-pitch propellers producing a speed of over 17 knots. A hydraulically operated system of shell ports, doors, flaps, <b>roofs,</b> <b>bath</b> platforms, gangways and cranes provide the most possible ease of operation and comfort. The anchors, launches, life rafts and navigation lanterns are hidden behind covers and do not disturb the aesthetics of the yacht.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} built to {{resemble}} {{the description of the}} old chapel - after the style of the 14th century. The west window of the south aisle is similar to one in the Church of Little St. Mary's Cambridge, which was erected about 1850. Each window has tracery of a different pattern. The stone used with the flints is <b>Bath</b> stone. The <b>roof</b> and floor are covered with Broseley tiles. The height of the spire is 110 feet. The interior of the church gives an area of 105 feet long by 75 feet broad, and gives sitting accommodation for 650 persons.|$|R
2500|$|... in 1881–82 the chancel ( [...] long by [...] wide) was {{completely}} rebuilt. In 1883 the nave, south aisle and porch were rebuilt {{and the north}} aisle, organ chamber and vestry were added. With {{the exception of the}} porch doorway, all the rebuilding was in the Early English style, the style which the original building showed most signs. Local stone was used for the main walls and Hatherleigh stone was used for the buttresses, quoins, dressings, copings, and window tracery. Internally, the window dressings and the arches of the north aisle are of Corsham <b>Bath</b> stone. The <b>roofs</b> of the nave and aisles are of pitch pine. The architect was Otho Bathurst Peter (1854-1937), of Launceston.|$|R
5000|$|The {{exterior}} is of sandstone quarried at Ore, {{donated by}} the church's sponsor Thomas Spalding and laid in courses. This is supplemented by some <b>Bath</b> stonework. The <b>roof</b> is tiled, but was covered with wooden shingles until they deteriorated. [...] The layout {{takes advantage of the}} steeply sloping site by incorporating a schoolroom and hall below the body of the church but still at ground level on the ritual south (London Road; geographical east) side. The plan consists of a tower at the ritual west (geographical south) end, leading into a six-bay combined nave and chancel with aisles on each side, a clerestory, a vestry and the lower-level hall on the ritual south side.|$|R

500|$|Hitherto, {{the quarry}} masons had always hewn stone roughly {{providing}} blocks of varying size. Wood required stone blocks {{to be cut}} with crisp clean edges for his distinctive classical façades. The [...] Stone was extracted by the [...] "room and pillar" [...] method, by which chambers were mined, leaving pillars of stone to support the <b>roof.</b> <b>Bath</b> stone is an Oolitic Limestone comprising granular fragments of calcium carbonate laid down during the Jurassic (195 to 135 million years ago). An important feature of Bath stone {{is that it is}} a freestone, that is one that can be sawn or 'squared up' in any direction, unlike other rocks such as slate, which forms distinct layers. It was extensively used in the Roman and Medieval periods on domestic, ecclesiastical and civil engineering projects such as bridges.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mosque and}} the Turkish [...] "Orta Mezar Bath" [...] {{just across the}} avenue were the targets of a night-time attempt on February 19, 2016, to {{instigate}} the historical buildings. The mosque had minor damage, possibly {{because of the presence}} of the restaurant, while the Turkish <b>bath's</b> dome and <b>roof</b> were almost completely destroyed by the fire. Those responsible for the attack were not found but the evidence pointed to the racist, fascist organizations of Bulgaria or/and to football hooligans. Bulgarian court was blamed for helping the racists by obfuscating the evidence and by not working enough to find those responsible. Turkish and Muslim organizations declared disappointment and fervent over the incident, and called for the renovation of the Turkish bath and return of the mosque once again.|$|R
60|$|The cotton whitens {{over two}} thirds of Pompeii yet interred: happy the {{generation}} that lives to learn the wondrous secrets of that sepulchre! For, when you have once been at Pompeii, this phantasm of the past takes deeper hold on your imagination than any living city, and becomes and is the metropolis of your dreamland forever. O marvelous city! who shall reveal the cunning of your spell? Something not death, something not life--something {{that is the one}} when you turn to determine its essence as the other! What is it comes to me at this distance of that which I saw in Pompeii? The narrow and curving, but not crooked streets, with the blazing sun of that Neapolitan November falling into them, or clouding their wheel-worn lava with the black, black shadows of the many-tinted walls; the houses, and the gay columns of white, yellow, and red; the delicate pavements of mosaic; the skeletons of dusty cisterns and dead fountains; inanimate garden spaces with pygmy statues suited to their littleness; suites of fairy bed-chambers, painted with exquisite frescos; dining-halls with joyous scenes of hunt and banquet on their walls; the ruinous sites of temples; the melancholy emptiness of booths and shops and jolly drinking-houses; the lonesome tragic theatre, with a modern Pompeian drawing water from a well there; the <b>baths</b> with their <b>roofs</b> perfect yet, and the stucco bass-reliefs all but unharmed; around the whole, the city wall crowned with slender poplars; outside the gates, the long avenue of tombs, and the Appian Way stretching on to Stabiae; and, in the distance, Vesuvius, brown and bare, with his fiery breath scarce visible against the cloudless heaven;--these are the things that float before my fancy as I turn back to look at myself walking those enchanted streets, and to wonder if I could ever have been so blest.|$|R
