40|$|Staphylococcus aureus toxin {{formation}} in hydrated batter mixes can cause consumer illness. This toxin {{in particular is}} a concern because the toxin cannot be destroyed by heating steps that may be performed by the processor or the consumer. Pathogens other than S. aureus are, in many cases, less likely to grow in hydrated batter mixes, {{and are likely to}} be killed by the heating steps that follow (FDA, 2011). Control Measures S. aureus can enter the process on raw materials. It can also be introduced into foods during processing from unclean hands and insanitary utensils and equipment. The hazard develops when a <b>batter</b> <b>mix</b> is exposed to temperatures favorable for S. aureus growth for sufficient time to permit toxin development. S. aureus toxin does not normally reach levels that will cause food poisoning until the numbers of the pathogen reach 500, 000 to 1, 000, 000 /gram. S. aureus will grow at temperatures as low as 44. 6 °F (7 °C) and at a water activity as low as 0. 83 (additional information on conditions favorable to S. aureus growth are provided in Table A- 1. However, {{toxin formation}} is not likely at temperatures lower than 50 °F (10 °C) or at water activity below 0. 85. For this reason, toxin formation can be controlled by minimizing exposure of hydrated batter mixes to temperatures above 50 °F (10 °C). Exposure times greater than 12 hours for temperatures between 50 °F (10 °C) and 70 °F (21. 1 °C) could result in toxin formation.

40|$|Continental Mills’ {{packing plant}} that {{produces}} Krusteaz products consists of several lines. Each line {{is able to}} package a variety of flour based mixes such as pancake <b>batter</b> <b>mix,</b> bread mixes and various cake mixes, in several sizes and packing formats, ranging from 12 ounces and up to 50 lbs, and filled in both paper bags, plastic bags or cardboard boxes, or combinations of the three. The factory has seven packing lines, but we are focusing on {{the four of them}} that are used for the Krusteaz pancake mix. The product allocation is allocated to the four lines based on several factors such as dissimilar speeds, labor requirements, down times, and conveyor lengths. Our main goal for this project is to maximize the Weekly Gross Profit on the four Krusteaz production lines by constructing a spreadsheet model and using Excel Solver Tools. We hope that our model might be helpful for production managers as a decision support tool, especially as it incorporates uncertainty about cost, prices and demand. This latter point is something that occurred to us as we progressed. The actual line allocation process (optimally allocating eight different package sizes between four different lines) {{turned out to be the}} easy part, and we soon realized how this type of analysis could be used by management not just as a production planning tool, but more importantly as a potential tool for finding a better balance between the supply and demand for these products. The spreadsheet can be used to study and evaluate various price and quantity combinations to assess which ones would best equate a proper balance or compromise between production efficiencies and the actual demand patterns for the products. Having this type of tool should allow the production and marketing people to communicate better and make more optimal allocation decisions using both product quantities and prices as decision variables. As mentioned, Excel was used as the primary platform for this project, and we added and considered both Frontline’s Risk Solver and Oracle’s Crystal Ball add-ins for running optimizations and simulations. Both were found to be valuable and relatively user friendly additions to the spreadsheet package...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Food Science, Washington State UniversityWhile {{the sponge}} cake (SC) baking test {{involves}} a lengthy, complicated procedure and requires experienced personnel to properly conduct the test, {{it provides the}} most informative and reliable estimation of overall end-use quality of soft white and club wheat especially for their uses in many Asian countries. Understanding of soft white wheat quality traits affecting SC baking is lacking and in great need of improvement. The objectives of this research were to develop a simple, fast and reliable baking test for predicting flour quality for use on sponge cakes and to identify functional properties of soft white wheat flour important for making acceptable sponge cakes. A simpler and comparably reliable SC baking test procedure was developed by making considerable modifications to the conventional test procedure at the egg foam whipping and <b>batter</b> <b>mixing</b> stages. Foam density, SC volume and crumb grain {{comparable to that of}} the conventional procedure were obtained with modifications, including extension of whipping time without heat input using a 5 -liter KitchenAid® mixer, one time water addition at 3 min before the completion of egg whipping instead of twice, and flour incorporation into the egg foam using a KitchenAid® wire whisk or a Beater Blade®. The modified method of using Beater Blade® or wire whisk for <b>batter</b> <b>mixing</b> exhibited significant correlations in SC volume with the conventional procedure (r= 0. 931, P< 0. 001, r= 0. 925, P< 0. 001, respectively). Significance of flour particle size on SC baking performance was determined using flours of different particle size prepared by re-grinding and sieving. Particle size reduction of flour by re-grinding improved SC volume (0. 8 - 15. 0 %) and crumb grain, with little change in density and viscosity of the flour-water batter despite increases in flour starch damage (0. 1 - 0. 2 %) and sodium carbonate retention capacity (4. 8 - 13. 9 %). Flour fractions of small (< 55 µm) particles produced the largest SC volume, ranging from 1353 - 1450 mL. Even with comparable or higher protein content, flour fraction of intermediate particle size produced larger volume (1040 - 1195 mL) of SC than did flour fractions of large particle size (955 - 1130 mL). The qualitative and quantitative roles of starch on SC baking potential of wheat flour were investigated using flours of various amylose content as well as different quantities and proportions of starch in the baking formula. Normal and single-null partial waxy flours produced SCs ranging from 1093 to 1335 mL in volume, while double-null partial waxy and waxy wheat flours produced SC of 828 to 895 mL. Both amylose content and pasting properties (final viscosity and setback) of wheat flour exhibited significant positive relationships with SC volume. Amylose content of normal and waxy starch blends was significantly related with their SC volume (r= 0. 975, P< 0. 05). Pure wheat starch of over 80 g or more than 75 % starch in 100 g starch-gluten blends in replacement of 100 g wheat flour in the SC baking formula were needed to produce SC having the maximum volume potential.
