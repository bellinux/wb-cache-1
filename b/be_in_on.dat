25|$|One Ranger, seventeen-year-old , {{who wanted}} to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the action, also died in the fighting. He {{was the son of}} camp cook, D. R. Smith and the {{youngest}} Ranger ever to die in the line of duty. Smith was apparently too inexperienced to fully appreciate McNelly's terse orders because he got too close to a wounded Mexican bandit; the bandit killed the boy before Smith even knew what was happening. Berry Smith was buried in the northwest corner of the Brownsville cemetery on June 16 with full military honors. The funeral was recorded as one of the finest the city had ever seen.|$|E

After widespread speculation of the two parties forming a coalition government, it was finally announced on 30 February 2008, 18 days after the elections, that both parties were discussing a coalition government. Before the assassination of Ms Bhutto, she and Nawaz Sharif were discussing a coalition if they won the elections that were held supposed to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> 8 January but no official agreement was reached. For the first time speaking after the accord was signed, Pervez Musharraf said that his government should keep personal vandettas aside, and keep politics aside, and had no problem working with a government that the people had elected.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The Washington Post, Allison Stewart {{opined that}} the track {{describes}} an eccentric night of romance, beginning with [...] "a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker" [...] {{and ending with}} [...] "you and me/Making love like gorillas". She concluded, [...] "for all its awfulness" [...] the song is the [...] "image shifter Mars needs". Idolator's Emily Tan commented [...] "the libidinous lyrics are disguised with epic guitars and Phil Collins-esque heavy drum combinations...strong enough to soundtrack a scene in a drama series". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine similarly felt that the [...] "drums and keyboards are nicely overwhelming, but the overall concept floats {{too far away to}} make a dent on the listener". Day Hyman of Spin thought that the lyrics on the album [...] "desperately needed kick in the pants" [...] mainly noticed on [...] "Gorilla". He also drew comparisons on the [...] "Prince-channeling" [...] vibe. On the critical side, Amy Dawson of Metro described it as a [...] "Phil Collins-esque low point" [...] in the album, [...] "in which the button-eyed singer makes plans to go at it {{in the same way as}} said giant ape, all over a Phil Collins-esque synth/percussion combo backing… but by the time the jungle noises kick in, you think he surely must <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the joke." ...|$|E

2500|$|Norfolk is {{the home}} county of Deaf Havana {{and many of the}} songs on Fools and Worthless Liars focus on the members childhoods' in the area. [...] "Hunstanton Pier" [...] is about the town of Hunstanton, where James Veck-Gilodi and bassist Lee Wilson went to school. 'It brings me back to the only place I ever really felt at home, and how much I miss it. It's hard for me to sing {{sometimes}} because it leads my mind to wander off and think about all the people I used to be so close to and what they are doing now'. [...] "Youth In Retrospect" [...] also deals with nostalgia and is again particularly personal to Veck-Gilodi and Lee Wilson. James has revealed that he is 'constantly battling with the fact that I'm constantly growing older' and how the pair 'wish we could go back to the days where... our biggest worry was whether our maths homework would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> time'. [...] "Times Change, Friends Leave and Life Doesn't Stop For Anybody" [...] is about former member Ryan Mellor, with whom James has been friends since they were 14. 'This song is just, I suppose, about how much we miss him'.|$|E
2500|$|Pitchfork Media commented, [...] "Over a frantic, Calvin Harris-produced, Guetta-meets-'Sandstorm' beat on her sixth record's lead-off single, Rihanna repeats {{these words}} almost 20 times. 'We Found Love' ranks among Ri's best singles because it recognizes that there's {{not much more}} {{that needs to be}} said: in three and a half minutes, the line moves from being a great pop lyric to a triumphant mantra to {{something}} suggestive of a whole spectrum of unspoken emotion. The best pop music transports you to somewhere beyond words, and Rihanna's strongest singles all seem to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> this secret." [...] Allmusic chose the song as a highlight on Talk That Talk, and wrote about the [...] "singer's ecstatic vocal than Calvin Harris' shrill, plinky production". Los Angeles Times commented that the song was an [...] "ode for bad love" [...] and added it [...] "wouldn't be out of place at Electric Daisy Carnival". The New York Times writer commented [...] "'We Found Love' almost criminally recalls the swinging Crystal Waters singles, with triumphant percussion somewhere between church and seventh-inning stretch." [...] Billboard magazine also praised the song, saying that: [...] "Through a haze of glitter and bliss, Rihanna emerges to let us find a gorgeous hook in a hopeless place, and Calvin Harris becomes a household name." [...] As of January 2015, Billboard named [...] "We Found Love" [...] as the best song of the 2010s (so far). USA Today considered the song to be a highlight on the set, commenting that Rihanna sings [...] "bistfully". [...] Entertainment Weekly noted, [...] "U.K. club king Calvin Harris trades Rihanna's usual somber synths for disco ecstasy on 'We Found Love,' a song that builds and builds to a climax that's so arena-ready it practically begs for someone to blow a vuvuzela".|$|E
