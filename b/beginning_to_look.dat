5|$|A month later, Jennifer is <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> pale, so she {{accepts a}} date with school goth/emo Colin, whom she brutally kills. While Needy and Chip have sex, Needy senses {{something}} dreadful has happened. She leaves in a panic and almost runs over Jennifer, who is drenched in blood. At home, she finds Jennifer in her bedroom. Jennifer kisses her, initiating a brief makeout session, and soon explains what happened after the fire: Low Shoulder took her {{into the woods and}} offered her as a virgin sacrifice to Satan in exchange for fame and fortune. Although the sacrifice and demonic exchange were a success, Jennifer was not a virgin. As a result, when lead singer Nikolai murdered her, the ritual backfired and a demonic spirit took over her body. Unbeknownst to Needy, Jennifer also encountered Indian exchange student Ahmet after the fire and, upon hearing that no one knew he had survived, took him into the woods and made him her first victim. Jennifer states that when she has eaten, she can withstand virtually any injury without pain, making her rather difficult to kill.|$|E

Clinical psychologists are <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the various strengths and weaknesses of each orientation while also working with related fields, such as neuroscience, behavioral genetics, evolutionary biology, and psychopharmacology. The result is a growing practice of eclecticism, with psychologists learning various systems and the most efficacious methods of therapy with the intent to provide the best solution for any given problem.|$|E

The Australians passed the follow-on target after drinks, and shortly after this Adam Gilchrist and Michael Clarke made their half-centuries. Just as Adam Gilchrist was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> dangerous and starting to score quickly, Ashley Giles had him caught attempting a six. He had made 64 runs off 79 balls, and the score was 384 for 6. Shane Warne joined Clarke at the crease, and the pair negotiated through to lunch, taking the score to 417 for 6.|$|E

25|$|At his death, Wren was 90 (N.S.). Even {{the men he}} {{had trained}} and who owed much of their success to Wren's {{original}} and leadership were no longer young. Newer generations of architects were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> past Wren's style. The Baroque school his apprentices had created was already under fire from a new generation that brushed Wren's reputation aside and looked back beyond him to Inigo Jones. Architects of the 18th century could not forget Wren, {{but they could not}} forgive some elements in his work they deemed unconventional. The churches left the strongest mark on subsequent architecture. In France, where English architecture rarely made much impression, the influence of St Paul's Cathedral {{can be seen in the}} church of Sainte-Geneviève (now the Panthéon); begun in 1757, it rises to a drum and dome similar to St Paul's, and there are other versions inspired by Wren's dome, from St Isaac's (1840–42) in St Petersburg to the US Capitol at Washington, D.C. (1855–65).|$|E
500|$|Written {{simultaneously}} with the concluding episode, [...] "The Time Is Now", the episode's script went through several different versions before a final plot was decided upon, as Morgan and Wong believed the series {{would not be}} renewed for a third season and wished to write a suitable ending. The idea of depicting an apocalyptic scenario as being {{the result of a}} virus came from Morgan's research into possible end-of-the-world scenarios, and was influenced by the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom. The build-up to, and depiction of, the viral outbreak was seen by the writing staff as conclusive proof that the series would be cancelled, leading to several writers <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for work on other projects while still officially under contract to work on Millennium.|$|E

In March 2012, Joss Whedon, director of the first film, stated that he would want a sequel to be [...] "smaller. More personal. More painful. By being the next thing that should happen to these characters, {{and not just a}} rehash of what seemed to work the first time. By having a theme that is completely fresh and organic to itself." [...] Despite the production of the film becoming increasingly wider in scope, Feige maintained that this was not their intention, always looking to see where the team wanted to take the characters, over how to make it bigger than The Avengers.|$|E

By 7 March 1942, Rangoon had fallen and the defense of the Burma Road became the priority of the Flying Tigers.|$|E
500|$|Viking Invasion {{received}} [...] "favorable" [...] reviews, albeit {{slightly less}} than the original Medieval: Total War, according to Metacritic. Reviewers felt the new gameplay features for the Vikings {{were the most important}} enhancement of the expansion pack, with Eurogamer commending the Vikings' raiding system as something that fixes what [...] "the original Medieval lacked". ActionTrip praised the new campaign as being a challenge for players: [...] "even on the normal difficulty setting, Viking Invasion is a very challenging game", a view shared by other critics. The pre-battle screen was commended by GameSpot, calling it a [...] "handy new feature." [...] GameSpot also praised the new additions to the original campaign, mentioning they have [...] "made castle sieges more interesting". The main criticism for Medieval: Total War – Viking Invasion was the graphics, with both ActionTrip and Eurogamer stating that they were [...] "starting to feel a little bit creaky". A lack of new multiplayer options was considered by GameSpot to be [...] "unfortunate", mentioning that [...] "a multiplayer campaign option would have been a great new feature". Overall, the expansion was received well by critics in the industry. IGN concluded by saying fans [...] "won't be disappointed with the Viking Invasion", while Actiontrip finished stating; [...] "the graphics are <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> old" [...] but the challenge made the expansion [...] "worth it". The review by GameSpot finished by saying [...] "overall, the expansion is a great addition to Medieval", and Eurogamer concluded with praising the addition it made to Medieval: Total War: [...] "It's a worthy expansion pack to a truly excellent game".|$|E
