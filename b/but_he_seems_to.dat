5|$|Despite these successes, the Arabs {{could not}} achieve a decisive result. The main Khazar army {{remained}} intact and a constant threat, since like all nomad forces {{it was not}} dependent on cities for supplies. Coupled {{with the fact that}} his rear was still insecure, al-Jarrah was forced to abandon any attempt at capturing Samandar as well, and to retreat to Warthan south of the Caucasus. From there he asked for reinforcements from Yazid, but although the Caliph promised to send more troops, he failed to do so. The sources are obscure on al-Jarrah's activity in 723, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have led another campaign north (which may indeed be the true date of the Balanjar campaign). In response, the Khazars raided south of the Caucasus, but in February 724, al-Jarrah inflicted a crushing defeat on them in a battle between the rivers Cyrus and Araxes that lasted for several days. Al-Jarrah followed up his success by capturing Tiflis, whose inhabitants were obliged to pay the kharaj but received a charter of rights in return. This campaign brought Caucasian Iberia and the lands of the Alans under Muslim suzerainty, and al-Jarrah became the first Muslim commander to march through the Darial Pass in the process. This expedition secured the Muslims' own flank against a possible Khazar attack through the Darial, while conversely it gave the Muslim army a second invasion route into Khazar territory.|$|E
5|$|In 721/722, {{the main}} {{phase of the}} war began. In the winter of this year, 30,000 Khazars {{launched}} an invasion of Armenia and inflicted a crushing defeat on the mostly Syrian army of the local governor Mi'laq ibn Saffar al-Bahrani at Marj al-Hijara in February/March 722. In response, Caliph Yazid II (r. 720–724) sent {{one of his most}} celebrated generals, al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah, with 25,000 Syrian troops north. Al-Jarrah was swiftly successful in driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovered Derbent and even advanced on Balanjar. The Khazars tried to defend their capital by ringing the citadel with a laager of wagons, but the Arabs broke it apart and stormed the city on 21 August 722 or 723. Most of Balanjar's inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north. Despite their success, however, the Arabs had not yet defeated the main Khazar army, which like all nomad forces was not dependent on cities for supplies. The continuing threat of the Khazar army forced the Arabs to abandon any attempt to capture Samandar as well, and to retreat to Warthan south of the Caucasus.

25|$|The next {{important}} king of Mercia, Æthelbald, reigned from 716 to 757. For {{the first}} few years of his reign he had to face two strong rival kings, Wihtred of Kent and Ine of Wessex. But when Wihtred died in 725, and Ine abdicated in 726 to become a monk in Rome, Æthelbald was free to establish Mercia's hegemony over the rest of the Anglo-Saxons south of the Humber. Æthelbald suffered a setback in 752, when the West Saxons under Cuthred defeated him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have restored his supremacy over Wessex by 757.|$|E

25|$|The {{details of}} Leo's early {{career in the}} Muslim fleets are unknown, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have risen quickly: the {{historian}} Mas'udi, who met him in person, regarded {{him as one of}} the best navigators of his time. In the Arabic sources, he appears with the generic titles of commander (qā’id) or admiral (amīr al-baḥr), as well as governor (ṣāḥib) of Tripoli, and deputy governor (nā’ib) of Tarsus. Both of the latter cities were major Muslim naval centres in the late 9th century, and due to their proximity to the Byzantine Empire functioned as staging areas for the Muslim naval raids.|$|E
25|$|Upon Thutmose's coronation, Kush rebelled, {{as it had}} {{the habit}} of doing upon the {{transition}} of Egyptian kingship. The Nubian state had been completely subjugated by Thutmose I, but some rebels from Khenthennofer rose up, and the Egyptian colonists retreated into a fortress built by Thutmose I. On account of his relative youth at the time, Thutmose II dispatched an army into Nubia rather than leading it himself, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have easily crushed this revolt {{with the aid of}} his father's military generals. An account of the campaign is given by the historian Josephus who refers to it as the Ethiopic War.|$|E

25|$|Evidently Belli {{attempted}} to secure permanent employment at the Ferrara court, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been unsuccessful. During the late 1580s {{he may have}} worked again for the Gonzagas in Mantua, but if so, the dates are not known. For most of {{the remainder of his}} life he worked in Argenta as maestro di cappella and music teacher, but since Argenta was a relative backwater compared to Ferrara, Venice, and the other cities in the region, Belli's fame never attained that of many of his contemporaries. Belli remained connected with Ferrara until his death, {{as a member of the}} Accademia degli Intrepidi; however after Ferrara was annexed by the Papal States in 1597, the music scene there declined, and its avant-garde character was extinguished. Belli probably died at Argenta around 1620.|$|E
25|$|Empedocles is {{considered}} the last Greek philosopher to write in verse and the surviving fragments of his teaching are from two poems, Purifications and On Nature. Empedocles was undoubtedly acquainted with the didactic poems of Xenophanes and Parmenides– allusions to the latter {{can be found in}} the fragments,– <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have surpassed them in the animation and richness of his style, and in the clearness of his descriptions and diction. Aristotle called him the father of rhetoric, and, although he acknowledged only the meter as a point of comparison between the poems of Empedocles and the epics of Homer, he described Empedocles as Homeric and powerful in his diction. Lucretius speaks of him with enthusiasm, and evidently viewed him as his model. The two poems together comprised 5000 lines. About 550 lines of his poetry survive, although because ancient writers rarely mentioned which poem they were quoting, it is not always certain to which poem the quotes belong. Some scholars now believe that there was only one poem, and that the Purifications merely formed the beginning of On Nature.|$|E
25|$|Small {{has been}} {{recorded}} {{in a number of}} single wicket matches <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been less successful in this form of cricket than in the eleven-a-side version. He did have one single wicket innings that was of enormous significance {{in the evolution of the}} sport because it led directly to the introduction of the third (middle) stump to what had always been a two-stump wicket. The match in question took place at the Artillery Ground on 22 & 23 May 1775 between Five of Kent (with Lumpy Stevens) and Five of Hambledon (with Thomas White). Kent batted first and made 37 to which Hambledon replied with 92, including 75 by Small, that being his highest known score in a single wicket match. In their second innings, Kent scored 102, leaving Hambledon a target of 48 to win. Small batted last of the Hambledon Five and needed 14 more to win when he went in. He duly scored the runs and Hambledon won by 1 wicket but a great controversy arose afterwards because, three times in the course of his second innings, Small was beaten by Lumpy only for the ball to pass through the two-stump wicket each time without hitting the stumps or the bail. As a result of Lumpy's protests, the middle stump was introduced, although it was some years before its use became universal.|$|E

He subsequently refuses to explain his actions to Bella and warns her against befriending him.|$|E
500|$|As the self-declared [...] "Pimp General of All England", the swaggering Harris {{amassed a}} {{considerable}} fortune, but his indiscretion {{proved to be}} his undoing. [...] Prompted by reformers, in April 1758 the authorities began to hunt down and close [...] "houses of ill fame". [...] Covent Garden was not spared, and the Shakespear's Head Tavern was raided. [...] Harris was caught, locked up in the local compter, and then imprisoned in Newgate. [...] He was released in 1761 and had some interests in publishing from 1765 to 1766, printing Edward Thompson's The Courtesan, and later The Fruit-Shop and Kitty's Atlantis, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have given this up late in 1766. [...] He became the proprietor of the Rose Tavern, {{not far from the}} Shakespear's Head, but by the 1780s had delegated its running to an employee. [...] The Rose was demolished about 1790, and for a few years Harris ran another tavern, the Bedford Head, with his son and daughter-in-law. [...] He died sometime in 1792. [...] The Shakespear's Head closed for business in 1804, and four years later the empty premises were badly damaged in the same fire that consumed the Covent Garden Theatre. [...] What remained was subsumed by the neighbouring Bedford Coffee House.|$|E
500|$|John L. Flynn, a Towson University English {{professor}} {{who has written extensively}} about science-fiction film, unfavorably compared Night of the Blood Beast to The Creeping Terror (1964), which was also about an astronaut returning from space with a stowaway alien creature. Although Flynn said it lacked the [...] "epic pretentiousness" [...] of that film, he nevertheless said of Blood Beast: [...] "Corman {{made a career out of}} making cheap knock-offs of popular films, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be scraping the bottom of the barrel here". The Washington Post writer Tom Shales said [...] "it would be hard to find a worse movie" [...] and that the monster [...] "looks like the San Diego Chicken after having been tarred and feathered". Film critic and historian Steven H. Scheuer said the plot was a good idea but criticized what he called a [...] "sloppy execution". Literary and film critic John Kenneth Muir said he considered the film a failure because the monster [...] "simply could not live up to expectations once revealed". Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars with the entry: [...] "Well directed, but too low budget to succeed." [...] Night of the Blood Beast was among several films universally considered terrible that film reviewer Michael Adams watched as part of a book about his quest to find the worst film of all time. However, Adams said he enjoyed it on a B movie level, calling it [...] "cheap but enjoyable and buoyed by its ideas". John Stanley, who hosted the San Francisco television show Creature Features about science-fiction films, said Night of the Blood Beast deliberately imitated the best scenes from The Thing from Another World. Chris Eggerston of Bloody Disgusting wrote that the alien in the film [...] "looks like a human-sized parrot covered in feces" [...] and ranked it as the fifth worst movie monster of all time. However, he said that the film's idea of an alien impregnating a human being was an [...] "interesting concept," [...] noting that it was reused in Ridley Scott's Alien.|$|E
