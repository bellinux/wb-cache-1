The specific fibrillar structure of commercially available polyethylene films, which have high sensitivity to a fast recrystallization of {{some parts of}} surface fibrils during short-term heating at a lower temperature than the melting temperature of polyethylene crystalline grains, was found. Views and dimensions surface layers nanostructured elements as probable reasons of thermal printing contrast were estimated. The temperature effect on optical parameters of films was defined...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to characterize the deposits of calcium phosphate produced <b>by</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>printing</b> in terms of structure, topography and mechanical properties. Hydroxyapatite was molten and directed to (a) a titanium target in relative motion and (b) stationary titanium substrates preheated to 100 °C and 350 °C. Scanning electron microscopy showed round-like deposits, but high resolution profilometry measured the profile. Micro-Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction characterized the surface for structure, while nanoindentation revealed the hardness and elastic modulus. A symmetrical hemispherical deposit was formed on a surface in slow relative motion, but an off-centre shape formed at a higher relative speed. Deposits on preheated surfaces (100 °C and 350 °C) were identified as amorphous calcium phosphate. Nanoindentation revealed {{no significant difference in}} hardness between the amorphous deposits (4. 0 – 4. 4 ± 0. 3 GPa), but the elastic modulus increased from 65 ± 4 GPa (annealed calcium phosphate reference) to 88 ± 3 GPa (100 °C surface) and then to 98 ± 3 GPa (350 °C substrate). The large change in elastic modulus is thought to arise from the dehydroxylation during thermal printing. Production of functional materials through crystallization is discussed to extend the range of possible microstructures. The characterization and testing approach is useful for hemispherical deposits produced by printing, coatings (laser ablation, thermal spraying, simulated body fluid) and melt extrusion elements in scaffolds...|$|E

40|$|The {{prototype}} of an amperometric glucose biosensorwas realized <b>by</b> <b>thermal</b> inkjet <b>printing</b> using biological and electronicwater-based inks, containing a glucose oxidase (GOD) from Aspergillus niger and the conducting polymer blend poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene/polystyrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT/PSS), respectively. The biosensor was fabricated microdepositing PEDOT/PSS and GOD, in sequence, on ITO-glass, by a commercial inkjet printer, {{with the help}} of a commercial software. High density microdots matrices were so-realized, with a calculated resolution of about 221 × 221 dpi (dot per inch). By means of a rapid and easy assay it was demonstrated that no activity loss occurred upon the printing of GOD, despite of the use of a thermal printhead. The device was encapsulated in a semipermeable membrane of cellulose acetate, applied by dip-coating, in order to prevent dissolution of the enzyme and/or PEDOT/PSS in water. The preliminary response of the electrode was measured in an aqueous glucose solution in the presence of ferrocenemethanol (FeMeOH) as a mediator, and resulted linear up to 60 mM in glucose. The best sensitivity value achieved was 6. 43 AM− 1 cm− 2 (447 nAM− 1 U− 1 cm− 2). The characteristics of the device, and the possible performance improvements have been analyzed and discussed. The reported findings indicate that inkjet printing could be a viable instrument for the easy construction of a working biosensor via direct digital design using biological and conductive polymer based inks. Such an approach may be seen as an example of “biopolytronics”...|$|R

The results have been compared to the ones obtained for a continuous film of the same polymer deposed by spin-coating. No appreciable differences were noted between the electrochemical behaviour of the two samples, indicating that the <b>thermal</b> <b>printing</b> of the polymer did not alter appreciably the material properties.

40|$|The {{subjective}} {{image quality}} of panoramic radiographs shown on a diagnostic computer monitor {{were compared with}} professional direct <b>thermal</b> <b>prints</b> and with common inkjet prints on different paper qualities. Indirect digital panoramic radiographs were obtained from 15 patients. The images were printed with a direct thermal printer in their original format. Afterwards, these were loaded in an imaging software programme (Microsoft Photo Editor) and assessed both on computer monitor and inkjet prints on transparency, glossy, satin and regular paper. Five observers assessed subjective image quality for different regions and anatomical landmarks on a 5 -point rating scale. Data were statistically analysed and inter- and intra-observer performances were calculated. Best image quality was obtained with direct <b>thermal</b> <b>prints,</b> followed in descending order by panoramic images viewed on the monitor, inkjet prints on transparencies, glossy paper, satin paper and finally regular paper. The differences were significant except for monitor images versus direct <b>thermal</b> <b>prints,</b> inkjet-transparencies and inkjet-glossy images and inkjet-satin versus inkjet-glossy images. The subjective image quality of indirect digital panoramic images is different for images shown on the computer monitor and for printed images depending on both the printer and paper type used. status: publishe...|$|R

Owing to the high metal conductivity, the <b>thermal</b> transfer <b>printed</b> tags printed with copper (Cu) film performed as well or better than the inkjet printed tags printed with silver ink, even when they changed the inkjet printed tags to a Kapton substrate that is better suited to inkjet printing. The aluminium (Al) <b>thermal</b> transfer <b>printed</b> tags had up to 33 % less read range than Cu <b>thermal</b> transfer <b>printed</b> tags. TTP needs no sintering, and provides an attractive alternative low-cost fabrication method. Characterisation of the printed traces by both methods reveals that the printing techniques achieve similar surface roughness. The achieved conductivities for TTP on THERMLfilm were better than for inkjet. The best measured read range for TTP was 10. 6 m. Across the different tag designs, the measured read ranges were 15 - 60 % (1 - 10 %) better for <b>thermal</b> <b>printing,</b> compared with inkjet printing on THERMLfilm (Kapton) ...|$|R
