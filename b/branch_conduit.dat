50|$|Springs were by far {{the most}} common sources for {{aqueduct}} water; for example, most of Rome's supply came from various springs in the Anio valley and its uplands. Spring-water was fed into a stone or concrete springhouse, then entered the aqueduct conduit. Scattered springs would require several <b>branch</b> <b>conduits</b> feeding into a main channel. Some systems drew water from open, purpose-built, dammed reservoirs, such as the two (still in use) that supplied the aqueduct at the provincial city of Emerita Augusta.|$|R

Each nanotube is pulled from a micropipette-held feeder vesicle by mechanical retraction of the vesicle after molecular bonding to a rigid substrate. The caliber of the tube is controlled precisely in a range from 20 to 200 nanometers merely by setting the suction pressure in the micropipette. <b>Branched</b> <b>conduits</b> can be formed by coalescing separate nanotubes drawn serially from the feeder vesicle surface.

The lung model consists of 6. 744 × 106 unstructured tetrahedral computational cells.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The distribution of a microgravity two-phase flow throughout a manifold system consisting of two parallel flow headers joined by <b>branching</b> <b>conduits</b> was modeled. Adiabatic conditions were assumed. The two-phase flow was modeled using the homogeneous equilibrium model for pressure changes, along with a previously developed phase separation equation which describes the phase redistribution at a dividing T-junction. An iterative numerical method for calculating the mass flow rate, flow quality, and pressure associated with the flow throughout a manifold was developed. This calculational procedure was developed in order to calculate the flow distribution throughout a system, given only the inlet flow conditions and an arbitrary manifold geometry. Sample calculations for fluids and geometries of interest were performed in order to evaluate the performance of the code and design an experiment for code validation. Only one applicable microgravity two-phase flow experiment exists in the literature, and its results are qualitative and limited. Therefore, an experiment was designed which will produce the data necessary to validate this and other similar codes...|$|R
40|$|The {{subdivision}} of {{two-phase flow}} in <b>branching</b> <b>conduits</b> {{consisting of a}} large horizontal main pipe with upward, downward, or lateral branches of reduced diameter is of great interest in various technological fields. For example, these conduits are important in light-water nuclear reactors (LWRs) {{in the case of}} a small break loss-of-coolant accident (SBLOCA) in a leg of the reactor's primary coolant loops, as well as for breaks or valve malfunctions in a large pipeline. In these kinds of circumstances, the relevant phenomenology often involves phase stratification coupled with possible liquid entrainment or gas pool-through phenomena. Therefore, these phenomena were studied in depth to evaluate the pressure drop across conduit elements resulting from the redistribution of flow phases and the discharged mass among them. In the past, several experiments have been performed along with studies in flow modelling. As a result, several formulae and models for branch exit quality and consequent discharge mass flow rate predictions have been proposed. In recent years, we have been engaged in extensive research on this subject, resulting in a new semi-empirical formulation to express branch exit quality in terms of the physical processes taking place in the conduits, the operating parameters and the branch geometry. In this paper, we applied these correlations to representative sets of experiments previously reported in the literature, comprising a wide range of branch-to-main-pipe diameter ratios and operating pressures, which proved our formulation to be very accurate...|$|R

40|$|In plants, {{water flows}} from roots to leaves through a complex network of xylem conduits. The xylem {{architecture}} {{is characterized by}} the conduit enlargement towards the stem base and the multiplication of conduits near the apices of lateral branches. The xylem architecture of a small ash tree was analysed by measuring the vessel hydraulic diameter (Dh) and number (N) at different heights along the stem and branches. Along the stem, Dh and N increased from the apex to the point of crown insertion. Below, Dh and N decreased and remained constant, respectively. In branches, the Dh and N of apices increased with distance from the ground (PL) (P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 0001, respectively), indicating that apical resistance (RAPEX) becomes lower in the most peripheral branches (P < 0. 0001). At the level of branch nodes along the stem, the total conductive area (AC) of the stem and branches just above the node was 11 % higher than that of the stem just below the node (P = 0. 024), whereas the conductivity (Kh) remained invariant above and below (P = 0. 76). The difference in AC (ΔAC) between the branches and stem above each node increased with the distance of the node position from the stem apex (L). The xylem architecture of the analysed tree was characterized by anatomical modifications likely aimed at equilibrating the different path length effects on the hydraulic resistance of the different <b>branches.</b> <b>Conduit</b> tapering and multiplication seem to play a crucial role for the achievement of equal hydraulic resistance of all the leaves in the crown...|$|R

40|$|Long {{nanotubes}} of fluid-bilayers {{were used}} to create templates for photochemical polymerization into solid-phase conduits and networks. Micromechanical methods were developed which allowed each nanotube to be pulled from a micropipette-held feeder vesicle by mechanical retraction of the vesicle after molecular bonding to a rigid substrate. The caliber of the tube was controlled precisely in a range from 20 to 200 nanometers by setting the suction pressure in the micropipette. <b>Branched</b> <b>conduits</b> were formed by coalescing separate nanotubes drawn serially from the feeder vesicle surface. Single nanotubes and nanotube junctions could be linked together between bonding sites on a surface to create a functionalized network. After assembly, the templates were stabilized by photoinitiated radical cross-linking of hydrophilic monomer contained in the aqueous solution confined by the lipid bilayer boundary. ^ Nanometer-sized vesicles that were prepared by extrusion were also used as templates for photopolymerization. Results from dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy experiments suggest that UV initiated, free-radical polymerization of vesicle-encapsulated monomer resulted {{in the formation of}} cross-linked polymer networks that were surrounded by a bilayer lipid membrane. Using fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor the release of an initially entrapped marker, it was determined that lumenal polymerization neither disrupted the semi-permeable membrane, nor did it effect the osmotic release of encapsulated solutes. The addition of detergent to a suspension of polymerized vesicles completely dissolved the bilayer membrane, leaving behind a rigid gel replica of the vesicular template. ^ Two polymerizable amphiphiles with reactive headgroups were prepared and incorporated into the phospholipid bilayer, so as to provide a means to copolymerize the bilayer sheath with the liposome-encapsulated monomer. By monitoring the release of entrapped solutes, it was discovered that photopolymerization of vesicles constructed with either one of the amphiphilic monomers in combination with encapsulated monomer resulted in membrane destabilization, and the complete release of the entrapped solutes. This represented a new approach to the photoinduced release of vesicle contents. In fact, vesicles that contained the polymerizable lipid but not the entrapped monomer also exhibited contents release upon polymerization. During polymerization, the propagating membrane-bound polymer destabilized the membrane. Two simple models were put forth to explain the photoinduced release from polymerized vesicles. One takes into consideration the mechanical stresses that develop in the membrane asymmetric polymerization; the second suggests that release of contents was caused by formation of a membrane-bound, polymeric surfactant which forms “pores” in the membrane. ...|$|R

We present new geophysical constraints on the shallow feeding system of Etna volcano derived from array analysis of infrasound radiated from two distinct sources, one located in the SE crater {{and one in the}} Voragine or NE crater (VNE). These two sources alternated in their behavior, with the VNE crater system radiating low amplitude background infrasound interrupted by episodes of increased infrasound radiation from the SE crater. This switching behavior suggested a branched shallow feeding system strongly controlled by the gas/magma-flux. Here, the VNE craters represented the preferential and most stable branch of degassing during stationary flux regime, while the SE crater branch activated in response to an increase in the magma/gas supply rate...|$|R

40|$|Despite on {{abundance}} {{of information on}} the anatomical and hydraulic features of the xylem transport system, there is still a lack of evidence on how the former may affect the latter. We carried out a comparative analysis of hydraulic and anatomical data to test the actual role of conduit tapering in controlling the distribution of hydraulic resistance along the longitudinal axis of a branch. We measured the total hydraulic resistance (R) of the main axis of 9 sycamore branches by measuring the water flow at the top apex. We repeated the measurements for reduced branch lengths. The scaling of R with the distance from the apex (L) was then compared with that predicted by a theoretical model built upon the actual conduit tapering of the analyzed branches. R scaled against L with a scaling exponent (d) that was always < 1. 0 (from 0. 29 to 0. 64). The scaling exponents from the actual measurements were not significantly different from those estimated by the model. The results highlight the essential role played by the tapering of xylem conduits in controlling the distribution of hydraulic resistances along a <b>branch</b> or stem. <b>Conduit</b> tapering {{is likely to be the}} most effective strategy to minimize the effect of height on the whole-tree hydraulic resistance.
