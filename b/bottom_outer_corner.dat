40|$|Magnetic field-induced {{particle}} manipulation is {{a promising}} technique for biomicrofluidics applications. It is simple, cheap, and also free of fluid heating issues that accompany other common electric, acoustic, and optical methods. This work presents a fundamental study of diamagnetic particle motion in ferrofluid flows through a rectangular microchannel with a nearby permanent magnet. Due to their negligible magnetization {{relative to the}} ferrofluid, diamagnetic particles experience negative magnetophoresis and are repelled away from the magnet. The result is a three-dimensionally focused particle stream flowing near the <b>bottom</b> <b>outer</b> <b>corner</b> of the microchannel that is the farthest {{to the center of}} the magnet and hence has the smallest magnetic field. The effects of the particle’s relative position to the magnet, particle size, ferrofluid flow rate, and concentration on this three-dimensional diamagnetic particle deflection are systematically studied. The obtained experimental results agree quantitatively with the predictions of a three-dimensional analytical model...|$|E

Two ECAP die configurations, having sharp and round corners, are used to determine the experimental flow-line fields for Pb, pure Cu and pure Al billets. Two different types of deformation behavior are observed when using the die with a sharp-corner: (a) for the Cu and Al billets a gap develops at the <b>outer</b> <b>corner</b> of the die so that the material flows without filling the <b>outer</b> <b>corner</b> and (b) for Pb billets a “dead-metal” zone is formed which fills with material in the <b>outer</b> <b>corner</b> of the die.

40|$|Abstract—Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) is {{currently}} being widely investigated because of its potential to produce ultrafine grained microstructures in metals and alloys. A sound knowledge of the plastic deformation and strain distribution is necessary for understanding the relationships between strain inhomogeneity and die geometry. Considerable research has been reported on finite element analysis of this process, assuming threedimensional plane strain condition. However, the two-dimensional models are not suitable due to the geometry of the dies, especially in cylindrical ones. In the present work, three-dimensional simulation of ECAP process was carried out for six <b>outer</b> <b>corner</b> radii (sharp to 10 mm in steps of 2 mm), with channel angle 105 �, for strain hardening aluminium alloy (AA 6101) using ABAQUS/Standard software. Strain inhomogeneity is presented and discussed for all cases. Pattern of strain variation along selected radial lines {{in the body of}} the workpiece is presented. It is found from the results that the <b>outer</b> <b>corner</b> has a significant influence on the strain distribution in the body of work-piece.

40|$|The {{acoustical}} {{response of}} 90 degree sharp bends to acoustical perturbations {{in the absence}} of a main flow is considered. The aeroacoustical response of these bends is presented in part II [1]. The bends considered have a sharp 90 degree inner edge and have either a sharp or a rounded <b>outer</b> <b>corner.</b> They are placed in pipes with either a square cross-section (2 D-bends) or a circular cross-section (3 D-bends). The acoustical performance of a numerical method based on the non-linear Euler equations for two-dimensional inviscid and compressible flows is checked and its ability to predict the response of 3 D-bends is investigated. The comparison between 2 -D and 3 -D data is made for equal dimensionless frequencies f/fc where f is the frequency of the acoustical perturbations and fc is the cut-off frequency of the bends. In the case of a bend with a sharp inner edge and a sharp <b>outer</b> <b>corner,</b> the 2 -D numerical predictions agree with 2 -D analytical data obtained from a mode expansion technique and with 2 -D experimental data from literature and our own 3 -D experimental results. In the case of a bend with a sharp inner edge and a rounded <b>outer</b> <b>corner,</b> the 2 -D numerical simulations predict accurately the 2 -D experimental data from literature. However, the 2 -D numerical predictions do not agree with our 3 -D experimental data. The acoustical response of 3 D-bends appears to be independent of the shape of the <b>outer</b> <b>corner.</b> This behavior is quite unexpected...|$|R

The variation of stress (mean stress, max principle stress, effective stress), the distribution of strain, the lattice change were obtained. The results show that {{not only does the}} shear stress exist, but also the normal stress in the extrusion process; the stresses in die inner corner of channel and <b>outer</b> <b>corner</b> of channel are not the same. In the inner corner, besides the simple shear, there are compression, and in the <b>outer</b> <b>corner,</b> tension. The strain is non-homogeneous and appears a graded distribution...|$|R

40|$|The aeroacoustical {{response}} of 90 degree sharp bends {{is defined as}} the response to acoustical perturbations {{in the presence of a}} main flow. The acoustical {{response of}} bends, in the absence of a main flow, has been considered in part I [1]. Experiments are carried out for bends in pipes with circular cross-sections. These 3 D-bends have a sharp inner edge and have either a sharp <b>outer</b> <b>corner</b> or a rounded outer wall. The three-dimensional experimental results are compared with results of numerical simulations, based on the Euler equations for two-dimensional inviscid and compressible flows, and with analytical data obtained by means of two-dimensional quasi-steady flow theories. As observed in the absence of a main flow (part I [1]), the two-dimensional numerical simulations provide a good prediction of the aeroacoustical response of bends with a sharp inner edge and a sharp <b>outer</b> <b>corner.</b> For bends with a rounded <b>outer</b> <b>corner,</b> the prediction is less satisfactory. The two-dimensional quasi-steady flow approximation predicts reasonably well the response of bends up to Strouhal numbers of the order of unity. However, quasi-steady flow theories do not predict the irregularities of the response as a function of the flow velocity. These irregularities are expected to be a Strouhal number effect and are observed both in experiments and numerical simulations...|$|R
