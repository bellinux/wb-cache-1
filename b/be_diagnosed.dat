5|$|In overt primary {{hypothyroidism}}, TSH {{levels are}} high and T4 and T3 levels are low. Overt hypothyroidism may also <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in {{those who have a}} TSH on multiple occasions of greater than 5mIU/L, appropriate symptoms, and only a borderline low T4. It may also <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in those with a TSH of greater than 10mIU/L.|$|E
5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} may <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> {{when the}} combination of hyperglycemia (high blood sugars), ketones in the blood or on urinalysis and acidosis are demonstrated. In about 10% of cases the blood sugar is not significantly elevated ("euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis").|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to mortality, {{cancer is a}} cause of considerable morbidity in women. Women have a lower lifetime probability of being diagnosed with cancer (38% vs 45% for men), but {{are more likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with cancer at an earlier age.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 {{national}} {{report of}} the First Nations Regional Health Study found that of respondents who attended residential schools {{were more likely than}} those who did not to have <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with at least one chronic medical condition.

5|$|A {{physical}} examination and medical history {{are generally not}} enough to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious bursitis; aspiration of the bursal fluid is often required for this, along with a cell culture and Gram stain of the aspirated fluid. Septic prepatellar bursitis may <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> if the fluid is {{found to have a}} neutrophil count above 1500 per microliter, a threshold significantly lower than that of septic arthritis (50,000 cells per microliter). A tuberculosis infection can be confirmed using a roentgenogram and urinalysis.|$|E
5|$|Clinical or {{biochemical}} {{evidence of}} liver toxicity may develop in {{one to four}} days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12hours. Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated AST, ALT, bilirubin, and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated prothrombin time. After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed.</b> In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000IU/L.|$|E
5|$|Gout may <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> {{and treated}} without further {{investigations}} in someone with hyperuricemia and the classic acute arthritis {{of the base}} of the great toe (known as podagra). Synovial fluid analysis should be done, however, if the diagnosis is in doubt. X-rays, while useful for identifying chronic gout, have little utility in acute attacks.|$|E

5|$|Loss of {{function}} of the vagus nerve (X) {{will lead to a}} loss of parasympathetic innervation to {{a very large number of}} structures. Major effects of damage to the vagus nerve may include a rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Isolated dysfunction of only the vagus nerve is rare, but can <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> by a hoarse voice, due to dysfunction of one of its branches, the recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus {{is usually}} spread {{from person to}} person through {{infected}} fecal matter entering the mouth. It may also be spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva. Those who are infected may spread the disease for up to six weeks even if no symptoms are present. The disease may <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood. The disease only occurs naturally in humans.|$|E
5|$|Research {{from the}} late 1990s {{indicated}} there were disorders of attachment not captured by DSM or ICD and showed that RAD could <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> reliably without evidence of pathogenic care, thus illustrating some of the conceptual difficulties with the rigid structure of the current definition of RAD. Research published in 2004 showed that the disinhibited form can endure alongside structured attachment behavior (of any style) towards the child's permanent caregivers.|$|E

40|$|This {{study had}} been planned to see the histomorphological pattern of gastric mucosal biopsy, {{demonstrate}} the organism H. Pylori and correlate with endoscopic findings. The study {{was carried out in}} the department of the Pathology Rajshahi Medical College, Rajshahi, Bangladesh, during the period from January 2006 to December 2007. Endoscopic biopsy specimens were obtained from 105 cases of gastro duodenal lesions. According to endoscopic findings out of 105 cases 69 (65. 7 %) had gastric carcinoma, 06 (5. 71 %) had gastric ulcer, 05 (4. 76 %) had duodenal ulcer, 05 (476 %) had gastritis and 20 (19. 04 %) had normal mucosa, reported as non-ulcer dyspepsia. Of the 69 endoscopically gastric carcinoma 59 (85. 50 %) <b>were</b> <b>diagnosed</b> histologically as adenocarcinoma and 10 (14. 50 %) <b>were</b> <b>diagnosed</b> h-istologically as chronic gastritis in which H.

5|$|The domesticated cat and {{its closest}} wild {{ancestor}} are both diploid organisms that possess 38 chromosomes and roughly 20,000 genes. About 250 heritable genetic disorders {{have been identified}} in cats, many similar to human inborn errors. The high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as animal models {{in the study of the}} human diseases.|$|E
5|$|According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the {{question}} of whether attachment disorders can reliably <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines {{to such an extent that}} early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the fifth}} edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Tourette’s may <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> when a person {{exhibits}} both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics over the period of a year; the motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred {{before the age of}} 18, and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E

5|$|Antibody {{tests in}} {{children}} younger than 18months are typically inaccurate due to the continued presence of maternal antibodies. Thus HIV infection can only <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> by PCR testing for HIV RNA or DNA, or via testing for the p24 antigen. Much of the world lacks access to reliable PCR testing and many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is old enough for accurate antibody testing. In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2007–2009 between 30 and 70% of the population were aware of their HIV status. In 2009, between 3.6 and 42% {{of men and women}} in Sub-Saharan countries were tested which represented a significant increase compared to previous years.|$|E
5|$|If {{signs of}} {{disturbance}} are present {{for more than}} a month but less than six months, the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is applied. Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> as brief psychotic disorder, and various conditions may be classed as psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, while schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. If the psychotic symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance, then the diagnosis is one of a psychosis secondary to that condition. Schizophrenia is not diagnosed if symptoms of pervasive developmental disorder are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association {{released}} the fifth {{edition of the}} DSM (DSM-5). To <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with schizophrenia, two diagnostic criteria have to be met {{over much of the}} time of a period of at least one month, with a significant impact on social or occupational functioning for at least six months. The person had to be suffering from delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. A second symptom could be negative symptoms, or severely disorganized or catatonic behaviour. The definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes.|$|E

5|$|Many {{people with}} TS {{may not realize}} they have tics; because tics are more {{commonly}} expressed in private, TS may go unrecognized or undetected. It {{is not uncommon for}} the parents of affected children to be unaware that they, too, may have had tics as children. Because Tourette's tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now more likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not uncommon for several members of a family to <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they, too, had tics as a child.|$|E
5|$|Susan was {{diagnosed}} with Multiple sclerosis in 2007. Two years prior, MS Australia pitched a storyline to the Neighbours team asking for a character to <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with MS and for them to then show the impact MS can have on a community. The society contacted a producer and discussed a possible storyline for a young character in her twenties who had a promising career and family ahead of her. In 2006, the society {{received a phone call}} from one of the writers who revealed that they had chosen to write an MS story into the show and they had selected Susan Kennedy to be the character that was going to <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed.</b> The society was initially disappointed, as Susan was older than the typical person diagnosed with the condition. However, they were pleased that a permanent character and not an extra was chosen. MS Australia attended a meeting with the Neighbours writers to help develop a realistic and true portrayal of the diagnosis, symptoms and treatments. On-screen Susan was seen displaying unusual symptoms, including black outs and loss of sight and sensation in her hands. She was then seen undergoing an MRI scan, before she {{was diagnosed}} with multiple sclerosis.|$|E
5|$|Uncomplicated infections can <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> {{and treated}} based on {{symptoms}} alone. Antibiotics taken by mouth such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin are typically first line. Cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a fluoroquinolone {{may also be}} used. However, resistance to fluoroquinolones among the bacterial that cause urinary infections has been increasing. The FDA recommends {{against the use of}} fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects. These medications substantially shorten the time to recovery with all being equally effective. A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually sufficient, whereas nitrofurantoin requires 5–7days. Fosfomycin may be used as a single dose but has been associated with lower rates of efficacy.|$|E
