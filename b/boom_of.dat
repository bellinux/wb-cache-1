5|$|Clinton's November 2000 {{visit to}} Vietnam {{was the first}} by a U.S. {{president}} {{since the end of}} the Vietnam War. On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law the U.S.–China Relations Act of 2000, which granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) trade status to People's Republic of China. The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform. Clinton also oversaw a <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> the U.S. economy. Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of Highbury was {{restricted}} because the East Stand had been {{designated as a}} Grade II listed building {{and the other three}} stands were close to residential properties. These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of being left behind in the football <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> that time.|$|E

5|$|Since the Second World War, {{unemployment}} in Crawley has been low: the rate was 1.47% of the working-age population in 2003. During the <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> the 1980s the town boasted {{the lowest level}} of {{unemployment in}} the UK. Continuous growth and investment have made Crawley {{one of the most important}} business and employment centres in the South East England region.|$|E
5|$|Some unusual {{features}} of the Chinese vampire include its long, curved fingernails, perhaps derived from the appearance of growing fingernails on corpses due to flesh recession, and its greenish-white furry skin, perhaps derived from fungus or mould growing on corpses. Jiangshi legends have inspired a genre of jiangshi films and literature in Hong Kong and East Asia. Films like Encounters of the Spooky Kind and Mr. Vampire were released during the jiangshi cinematic <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The 1885 {{election}} {{in this district}} was held on September 17, 1885 {{as part of the}} 1885 Northwest Territories election.

The election grouped together a number of old districts that had been coming up for renewal on their three-year cycle and by-elections in new districts that were created by a population <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> settlers moving into the territory.|$|E

5|$|The copper mines prospered {{for about}} seventy years, {{but by the}} early 17th century the {{industry}} was in decline. Demand for copper fell {{and the cost of}} extracting it was high. Graphite mining continued, and quarrying for slate began to grow in importance. Other small-scale industries grew up, such as tannery and weaving. Although the <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> the mid-16th century had finished, the town's economy did not slide into ruin, and the population remained generally constant at a little under 1,000.|$|E
5|$|The heavy {{proportion}} of elderly {{persons in the}} district {{may be attributed to}} the settled way of life of those residents who arrived during the building <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> the 1960s: the children of these residents moved elsewhere to live, leaving their parents in the old dwelling. The skewed malefemale ratio is probably an artifact of the differential between male and female lifespans in Lithuania (male average lifespan in Lithuania was 66 years in 2004, as against 78 for females), according to the World Health Organization.|$|E
5|$|The newest of Manor Hall's annexes was {{originally}} {{a row of}} spacious townhouses constructed in the 1780s {{as part of the}} building <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> Clifton in between wars with France. 30-35 Richmond Terrace was a hotel prior before being acquired by the University in 2006. The building underwent a major refurbishment and it now provides self-catered en suite accommodation for 92 students. It was previously managed by University Student Houses and became a Manor Hall annexe in 2012.|$|E

5|$|The pre-Code horror cycle was {{motivated}} by financial necessity. Universal in particular buoyed itself with the production of horror hits such as Dracula (1931) and Frankenstein, then followed those successes up with Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932), The Mummy (1932), and The Old Dark House (1932). Other major studios responded with their own productions. Much like the crime film cycle, however, the intense <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> the horror cycle was ephemeral, and had fallen off {{at the box office}} {{by the end of the}} pre-Code era.|$|E
5|$|Tinker {{ended his}} {{involvement}} in professional baseball, focusing instead on his real estate ventures during the Florida land <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> the 1920s. He developed a successful real estate firm, buying and selling land in Orange County and Seminole County. He purchased the Longwood Hotel, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, in 1926. Tinker convinced Reds owner Garry Herrmann to use his stadium in Orlando for their spring training site in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Tinker {{returned}} to {{minor league baseball}} as a part-owner and manager for the Columbus Senators before moving to Orlando, Florida, to manage the Orlando Tigers.

However, the 1926 Miami hurricane and Great Depression cost Tinker most of his fortune, and he {{returned to}} professional baseball in the late 1930s.|$|E

5|$|After {{the liberation}} of Belgium in September 1944, there was a <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> new {{magazines}} for the youth, both in French and Dutch. Many of those tried to mix American comics with local artists. Vandersteen worked in these early years for countless publications. He continued publishing in Bravo, with the medieval gags of Lancelot. Having moved to the suburbs of Brussels to avoid the bombardments of Antwerp, he {{came into contact with}} some French language editors. French language magazines he contributed to included Franc Jeu, Perce-Neige, and Le Petit Monde. Two of the comics he created for Franc Jeu were also published in albums. By 1947, all these magazines had disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} rapid {{industrial}} growth that began in Indiana during the gas <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> the late 19th-century, labor unions began to form with goals of increasing wages and providing other benefits to workers through collective bargaining. The Indianapolis Traction and Terminal Company was founded to own and operate the streetcar terminal in downtown Indianapolis, and operate the Indianapolis Street Railway under a lease agreement for a term of 31 years. In 1892 the employees of Indianapolis Traction and Terminal Company launched a short-lived strike. The company was the primary public transportation provider in Indianapolis and operated the central transportation hub {{for the city of}} Indianapolis and state of Indiana. The company offered small concessions, and the workers returned to work without unionizing.|$|E

5|$|During the oil <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> the 1970s, Nigeria joined OPEC and {{the huge}} oil {{revenues}} it was generating enriched the economy. Despite these revenues, the military government did little to improve {{the standard of living}} of the population, help small and medium businesses, or invest in infrastructure. As oil revenues fueled the rise of federal subsidies to states, the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country. As oil production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and on international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns. It did not develop alternate revenue sources in the economy for economic stability. That spelled doom to federalism in Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Fort Lauderdale's {{first major}} {{development}} {{began in the}} 1920s, during the Florida land <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> the 1920s. The 1926 Miami Hurricane and the Great Depression of the 1930s caused {{a great deal of}} economic dislocation. In July 1935, an African-American man named Rubin Stacy was accused of robbing a white woman at knife point. He was arrested and being transported to a Miami jail when police were run off the road by a mob. A group of 100 white men proceeded to hang Stacy from a tree near the scene of his alleged robbery. His body was riddled with some twenty bullets. The murder was subsequently used by the press in Nazi Germany to discredit US critiques of its own persecution of Jews, Communists, and Catholics.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, {{a second}} Washington Park Race Track opened up in south {{suburban}} Homewood.

The inaugural meeting of organizers was July 3, 1926. The new track was constructed amongst a construction <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> racetracks in the United States during the 1920s, which included fifteen new large racetracks constructed during the decade.
