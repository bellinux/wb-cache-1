5000|$|This man {{is being}} Read by the QB. The defender is {{being forced to}} choose between {{tackling}} the <b>dive</b> <b>back</b> or the quarterback. The <b>dive</b> <b>back</b> explodes forward, puts his arms around the ball that is being extended, but does not take it. The quarterback, in his open stance, is reading the man being veered, in order to decide whether to [...] "pull" [...] the ball from the <b>dive</b> <b>back</b> and go through the hole, or to give the <b>dive</b> <b>back</b> the ball and have him go through the hole. This is where the name of the offense, the veer, comes from. This is just one part of the four-part option. If the quarterback keeps the ball, he attempts to cut up the field with the opposite side halfback, who has been running right towards the <b>dive</b> <b>back's</b> original position. He is the pitch man.|$|R
