5|$|After the {{war ended}} in 1865, McKinley decided on {{a career in the}} law and began {{studying}} in the office of an attorney in Poland, Ohio. The following year, he continued his studies by attending Albany Law School in New York. After studying there for less than a year, McKinley returned home and was admitted to the bar in Warren, Ohio, in March 1867. That same year, he moved to Canton, the county seat of Stark County, and set up a small office. He soon formed a partnership with George W. Belden, an experienced lawyer and former judge. His practice was successful enough for him to buy a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> on Main Street in Canton, which provided him with a small but consistent rental income for decades to come. When his Army friend Rutherford B. Hayes was nominated for governor in 1867, McKinley made speeches on his behalf in Stark County, his first foray into politics. The county was closely divided between Democrats and Republicans, but Hayes carried it that year in his statewide victory. In 1869, McKinley ran for the office of prosecuting attorney of Stark County, an office usually then held by Democrats, and was unexpectedly elected. When McKinley ran for re-election in 1871, the Democrats nominated William A. Lynch, a prominent local lawyer, and McKinley was defeated by 143 votes.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to revitalize}} {{downtown}} increased in 2013. CBS television executive and Saginaw native David Strouse announced an investment plan in late 2013 {{that would save}} nearly an entire <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> slated for demolition {{at the intersection of}} Washington and Genesee, the core of downtown Saginaw. The plan calls for the renovation and redevelopment of four buildings, creating market-rate apartments on the upper floors and retail space at ground level. In 2012, a similar deal was made in regards to the Bancroft and Eddy apartments, located at the same intersection. Once section-8 housing, these buildings will also be transformed into market-rate apartments and retail space.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} {{intent of the}} Seaport development was {{the preservation of the}} <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> known as Schermerhorn Row on the southwest side of Fulton Street, which were threatened with neglect or future development, {{at a time when the}} history of New York City's sailing ship industry was not valued, except by some antiquarians. Early historic preservation efforts focused on these buildings and the acquisition of several sailing ships. [...] Almost all buildings and the entire Seaport neighborhood are meant to transport the visitor back in time to New York's mid-19th century, to demonstrate what life in the commercial maritime trade was like. Docked at the Seaport are a few historical sailing vessels, including the Wavertree. A section of nearby Fulton Street is preserved as cobblestone and lined with shops, bars, and restaurants. The Bridge Cafe, which claims to be [...] "The Oldest Drinking Establishment in New York" [...] is in a building that formerly housed a brothel.|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} is {{the result}} of an ongoing European H 2020 project entitled DR-BOB Demand Response in <b>Blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>Buildings</b> (DR-BOB) that seeks to integrate existing technologies to create a scalable solution for Demand Response (DR) in <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings.</b> In most EU countries, DR programs are currently limited to the industrial sector and to direct asset control. The DR-BOB solution extends applicability to the building sector, providing predictive <b>building</b> management in <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings,</b> enabling facilities managers to respond to implicit and explicit DR schemes, and enabling the aggregation of the DR potential <b>of</b> many <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> for use in demand response markets. The solution consists of three main components: the Local Energy Manager (LEM), which adds intelligence and provides the capacity for predictive <b>building</b> management in <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings,</b> a Consumer Portal (CP) to enable building managers and building occupants to interact with the system and be engaged in demand response operations, and a Decentralized Energy Management System (DEMS®, Siemens plc, Nottingham, England, UK), which enables the aggregation of the DR potential <b>of</b> many <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings,</b> thus allowing participation in incentive-based demand response with or without an aggregator. The paper reports the key results around Business Modelling development for demand response products and services enabled by the DR-BOB solution. The scope is threefold: (1) illustrate how the functionality of the demand response solution can provide value proposition to underpin its exploitation by four specific customer segments, namely aggregators and three types <b>of</b> Owners <b>of</b> <b>Blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>Buildings</b> in different market conditions, (2) explore key aspects of the Business Model {{from the point of view}} of a demand response solution provider, in particular around most the suitable revenue stream and key partnership, and (3) assess the importance of key variables such as market maturity, user engagement, and type <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> as drivers to market penetration and profitability. The work presented is framed by the expected evolution of DR services in different market contexts and the different relationships between the main stakeholders involved in the DR value chain in different EU countries. The analysis also relies on the results of interviews conducted at the fours pilot sites of the DR-BOB project with key representatives of the management, operations, and marketing. These are used to better understand customer needs and sharpen the value proposition...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} automatically construct a 3 D geometric model of an urban area by merging features extracted from a cadastral map of the area and from the corresponding digital elevation model (Dem). The cadastral map and the Dem are both transformed into two sets of contour segments: The segments extracted from the map represent contours <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> and <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings,</b> whereas the segments extracted from the Dem represent the external edges <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> (edges <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> are generally missed because <b>buildings</b> <b>of</b> a same <b>block</b> often have the same height). The fusion of these two sets takes two main steps. The Dem segments are first matched with map segments by pruning a correspondence graph using a maximal clique technique. The result gives the 3 D structure <b>of</b> the <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings.</b> The remaining map segments, i. e. those which have no correspondent in the Dem, represent the contours <b>of</b> the <b>buildings</b> inside the <b>blocks.</b> The elevation <b>of</b> such a [...] ...|$|R

In 1998, Gilmore Associates announced plans to convert the San Fernando Building and two other early 20th Century buildings located nearby (the Hellman and Continental Buildings) into 230 lofts. Gilmore's plan to convert a block of skid row into upscale lofts was initially met with skepticism; one expert described the location as desolate, and opined {{that the lack of}} such amenities as a grocery store nearby could make the project [...] "a tough sell."

40|$|Increased Demand Response (DR) is {{essential}} to fully exploit European power systems, {{which in turn is}} an absolute prerequisite for meeting European targets related to energy efficiency and climate change. Essentially DR involves consumers reducing or shifting their electricity usage during periods of peak electricity demand in response to time-based tariffs or other forms of financial incentives. The opportunities for realising demand response vary across Europe as they are dependent on the particular regulatory, market and technical contexts in different European counties. Nevertheless successful DR programs are becoming increasingly common for large industrial customers. However DR programs aimed at small and medium scale customers have mostly failed to meet their expected potential. <b>Blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> offer more flexibility in the timing of energy use, local energy generation and energy storage than single buildings and as such researchers and the energy industry are beginning to consider how <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> can operate collectively within energy networks to enhance the effectiveness of DR programs. This paper identifies the opportunities and technical, market and regulatory requirements for realising DR services in <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> in the European context. The work presented is part of an ongoing European Horizon 2020 project entitled Demand Response in <b>Blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>Buildings...</b>|$|R
