Baer did not pursue the idea, but it returned to him in August 1966 while waiting for a bus. Baer, then the head of the Equipment Design Division at military contractor Sanders Associates, came up with the concept of using a television to play games, and the next morning wrote up a four-page proposal for a US$20 [...] "game box" [...] that would plug into a television screen and play games on it. While the commercial video game industry did not yet exist at that point, the very first electronic computer games had been developed {{at the start of the}} 1950s, and by 1966 several early mainframe games had been developed for mainframe computers, which were typically only found in large academic or research institutions. In the proposal, Baer began by referring to the project using military terminology, but by the time he finished it he was referring to it as Channel LP, short for [...] "let's play". The proposed device would transmit a signal that the television set could tune into as if it were a television channel, and Baer described several games that could be played on it.|$|E

In an article titled [...] "The aging horror of Kenji Eno's D", Richard Mitchell of Engadget shared the same sentiments as others. He commended D for ushering in the era of survival horror by paving a path for games like Resident Evil, and said that without historical context, it's difficult to enjoy D in modern times. In 2008, Game Informer listed it among the worst horror games of all time.

40|$|Although most {{scholars}} trace the Liar Paradox to Plato’s contemporary, Eubulides, the paper argues that Plato <b>builds</b> <b>something</b> very like the Liar Paradox {{into the very}} structure of his dialogues with significant consequences for understanding his views. After a preliminary exposition of the liar paradox {{it is argued that}} Plato builds this paradox into the formulation of many of his central doctrines, including the “Divided Line” and the “Allegory of the Cave” (both in the Republic) and the “Ladder of Love” (in the Symposium). Thus, Plato may have been the first to formulate the view that Graham Priest calls dialetheism, roughly, the view that some contradictions are, in an illuminating way, inescapable and true. The paper argues that Plato builds this Liar paradox into the formulation of his signature views because he holds that the attempt by finite human beings to theorize about transcendent realities results in the simultaneous necessity, and impossibility, of transgressing the limits of language—leading to the paradoxes (contradictions). Finally, it is argued that the existence of these paradoxes in these Platonic doctrines is the direct result of an intrinsic hermeneutical circle in Plato’s aforementioned signature views...|$|R
