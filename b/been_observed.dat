5|$|Various {{bird species}} have <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> in the {{vicinity}} of Harveys Lake. These include surf scoters and black scoters, which have <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> there in the winter. Although greater scaups are rare in Pennsylvania away from Lake Erie, one was observed at the lake in July 1992. Franklin's gulls have also <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> near the lake, as have snow buntings and black-legged kittiwakes, and ruddy ducks. Nine brant geese were observed on the lake in May 1997.|$|E

5|$|Aquatic macroinvertebrates are {{not common}} {{in and around}} Catawissa Creek, as of 2003.

5|$|Black currawongs {{are found}} singly or in pairs, but may gather into groups of 20 to 80 birds. Birds have <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> digging wet yellow clay {{out of a}} drain and {{applying}} it all over their plumage. Wiping the carpal areas of wings in particular with their bills, they {{did not appear to}} wash afterwards, using the procedure as a form of dirt bath. The black currawong has an undulating flight pattern in time with its wing beats, and often cocks its tail in the air for balance when it lands. Play behaviour has <b>been</b> <b>observed,</b> particularly with subadult individuals. Black currawongs have <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> wrestling with each other, where a bird would attempt to force its opponent on its back, at Maydena, while others have been reported rolling on their backs and juggling with food items such as pears with their feet.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens have <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> calling wolves to {{the site}} of dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving the scraps more {{accessible}} to the birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.|$|E
30|$|Along the Basque {{coast in}} the first studied year {{gametogenesis}} onset <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> from spring (2010) to early summer (2010). Subsequently, from early summer (2010) to late summer (2010) spawning stage <b>was</b> <b>observed,</b> {{with the end of}} the gametogenic cycle observed in late summer (2010). New gametogenesis <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> from fall (2010) to winter (2011). In the second year, gametogenesis proceeded in spring (2011) and spawning stage <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> from spring (2011) and continued until fall (2011), indicating a larger spawning period during this second summer. Consequently, in this second year the end of gametogenic cycle <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> later, in fall (2011). Gametogenesis onset <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in winter (2012).|$|R

The station, “Water! Science Museum” <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> the most frequently, a total of sixteen times by sixteen different observers. The stations observed once by the sixteen observers are: “Well,Well,Well”, “DisappearingWaterfall Mystery”, “Streams Creatures”, “Lakes & Rivers & Oceans-Ohmy”, “BackyardWater Recycling”, and “Groundwater on the Move. ” The following stations <b>were</b> not <b>observed</b> at all: “Water!Water!

The fatty acid content was analyzed by microcapillary column gas-liquid chromatography. In the liver, significant decreases in triglyceride, cholesterol and phospholipids <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> after one week, and significant decreases in triglyceride <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> after three months. No changes <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> in the heart. In the lung, remarkable decreases in triglyceride and phospholipids <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> after three months.

5|$|Killer whales {{have also}} <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> preying on {{terrestrial}} mammals, such as deer swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America. Killer whale cannibalism {{has also been}} reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but {{this is likely to}} be the result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers. One killer whale was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident killer whales have never <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals for no apparent reason.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} big cats, the jaguar is capable of roaring and does so to warn {{territorial}} and mating competitors away; intensive bouts of counter-calling between individuals have <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> in the wild. Their roar often resembles a repetitive cough, and they may also vocalize mews and grunts. Mating fights between males occur, but are rare, and aggression avoidance behavior has <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> in the wild. When it occurs, conflict is typically over territory: a male's range may encompass that {{of two or three}} females, and he will not tolerate intrusions by other adult males.|$|E
5|$|Mating has <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> to {{take place}} {{at the end of the}} dry season, in early November, and births were {{inferred}} between late February and early March. Only one infant is born per season, despite females having two pairs of nipples. Infants are initially parked in unguarded tree holes while the mother forages. Older infants have not <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> clinging to the mother, and as they get older, they are parked in vegetation until they can move independently. Females produce milk for two years following the birth of the young. The offspring may remain under the care of their parents for three years or more, and there is no information about their dispersal at maturity. Females have not <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> giving birth in consecutive years.|$|E

5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} tungsten {{consists of}} five isotopes whose half-lives are {{so long that}} they can be considered stable. Theoretically, all five can decay into isotopes of element 72 (hafnium) by alpha emission, but only 180W has <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> to do so with a half-life of (1.8 ± 0.2)×1018 years; on average, this yields about two alpha decays of 180W in one gram of natural tungsten per year.
