40|$|An {{investigation}} of <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> due to blade vortex interaction (BVI) has been conducted. This investigation consisted of {{an examination of}} BVI <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> for two, three, and four-bladed model rotors at tip Mach numbers ranging from 0. 20 to 0. 50. <b>Blade</b> <b>slap</b> contours have been obtained for each configuration tested. Differences in <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> contours, peak sound pressure level, and directivity for each configuration tested are noted. Additional fundamental differences, such as multiple interaction BVI, are observed and occur for only specific rotor blade configurations. The effect of increasing the Mach number on the BVI <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> for various rotor blade combinations has been quantified. A peak <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> Mach number scaling law is proposed. Comparison of measured BVI <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> with theory is made...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{relative}} importance of blade/vortex interactions which occur on the retreating side of a model helicopter rotor disk is described. Some of the salient characteristics of this phenomenon are presented and discussed. It is shown that the resulting Secondary <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> may be of equal or greater intensity than the advancing side (Primary) <b>blade</b> <b>slap.</b> Instrumented model helicopter rotor data is presented which reveals the nature of the retreating blade/vortex interaction. The importance of Secondary <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> as it applies to predictive techniques or approaches is discussed. When Secondary <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> occurs it acts to enlarge the window of operating conditions for which <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> exists...|$|E
40|$|<b>Blade</b> <b>slap</b> {{encountered}} in rotary wings {{and its effect}} on helicopter performance are reported. The results of various individual flight tests are presented and, where possible, correlated with one another. Observations from the subjective evaluation of <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> are included, together with a modified form of the <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> factor (BSF) which {{can be used as a}} design criteria...|$|E
50|$|The foil {{is used as}} a {{thrusting}} (or point) weapon only. Contact {{with the}} side of the <b>blade</b> (a <b>slap</b> or slash) does not result in a score. The tip of the foil must be depressed for 15 (± 1) milliseconds while in contact with the opponent's lamé (wire-mesh jacket which covers valid target area) to score a touch. The tip must be able to support a minimum force of 4.90 newtons (500 grams-force) without the circuit breaking. This is tested with a 500g (± 3g) weight.|$|R
50|$|The {{case was}} a rigid {{rectangular}} frame enclosed by two detachable lids, one lid carried a stone {{and the other a}} leather. The lids could not be interchanged. With a lid removed, oscillating a handle drove a shaft along the frame. In both directions pinions on the shaft engaged with racks on the case to rotate the shaft to either push the blade forward against the stone or drag it against the strop. It was easy to use, fast and safe. It was noisy as each change of direction rotated the <b>blade</b> to <b>slap</b> against stone or leather.|$|R
5000|$|The other Animorphs {{suspect a}} Yeerk trap {{to lure the}} freedom fighters, but they return to the cave the Hork-Bajir is hiding in. He calls himself Jara Hamee. But Ax isn't {{convinced}} he's not a Controller, so Jara pulls his head open. Horrified, but seeing no Yeerk, the Animorphs have some peace of mind. But just then Controllers had found out where they were. The team concocts a plan. In order to help Jara Hamee escape, Rachel morphs him (Jara Hamee turns around {{in order not to}} see Rachel demorphing). Tobias is worried about Rachel, so he hitches a ride on one of her forehead <b>blades.</b> However, Tobias <b>slaps</b> into a branch, is knocked off, and finds himself in a Swainson's hawk's clearing, where the other Hork-Bajir is cornered by a group of human-Controllers and Visser Three himself. The Visser calls this Hork-Bajir Ket Halpak. Tobias provides a distraction by drawing out an aggressive Swainson's hawk, the [...] "owner" [...] of this clearing, and rakes the Visser's stalk eyes, allowing Ket Halpak to escape.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} tip shape {{modification}} on blade vortex interaction induced helicopter <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> noise was investigated. Simulated flight and descent velocities {{which have been}} shown to produce <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> were tested. Aerodynamic performance parameters of the rotor system were monitored to ensure properly matched flight conditions among the tip shapes. The tunnel was operated in the open throat configuration with treatment to improve the acoustic characteristics of the test chamber. Four promising tips were used along with a standard square tip as a baseline configuration. A detailed acoustic evaluation on the same rotor system of the relative applicability of the various tip configurations for <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> noise reduction is provided...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the EPNL procedure in quantifying helicopter <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> and tail rotor noise heard on approach {{some distance from the}} flyover position is addressed. Alternative methods of rating helicopter noise are reviewed including correction procedures to the EPNL concept which account for <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> and tail rotor noise. The impact of the use of such corrections is examined...|$|E
40|$|The modern {{helicopter}} {{offers a}} unique operational capability {{to both the}} public and private sectors. However, the use of the helicopter may become severely limited due to the radiated noise generated by the rotor system. A description is presented of some of the experimental results obtained with a model helicopter rotor in an anechoic wind tunnel with regard to blade stall as a source mechanism of <b>blade</b> <b>slap.</b> Attention is given to dynamic rotor blade surface phenomena and the resulting far field impulsive noise from the model helicopter rotor at high angles of attack and low tip speed. The results of the investigation strongly implicates the boundary layer as playing an important role in <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> due to blade/vortex interaction (BVI) in a highly loaded rotor. Intermittent stall cannot be ruled out as a possible source mechanism for <b>blade</b> <b>slap.</b> This implies that blade surface characteristics, airfoil shape and local Reynolds number may now be used as tools to reduce the resultant far-field sound pressure levels in helicopters...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} 34 studies {{indicates}} that several factors or variables might {{be important in}} providing a psychoacoustic foundation for measurements of the noise from helicopters. These factors are phase relations, tail rotor noise, repetition rate, crest level, and generic differences between conventional aircraft and helicopters. Particular attention {{was given to the}} impulsive noise known as <b>blade</b> <b>slap.</b> Analysis of the evidence for and against each factor reveals that, for the present state of scientific knowledge, none of these factors should be regarded as the basis for a significant noise measurement correction due to impulsive <b>blade</b> <b>slap.</b> The current method of measuring effective perceived noise level for conventional aircraft appears to be adequate for measuring helicopter noise as well...|$|E
40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} model helicopter rotor <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> due to blade vortex interaction (BVI) {{was conducted in}} a 5 by 7. 5 -foot anechoic wind tunnel using model helicopter rotors with two, three, and four blades. The results were compared with a previously developed Mach number scaling theory. Three- and four-bladed rotor configurations were found to show very good agreement with the Mach number to the sixth power law for all conditions tested. A reduction of conditions for which BVI <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> is detected was observed for three-bladed rotors {{when compared to the}} two-bladed baseline. The advance ratio boundaries of the four-bladed rotor exhibited an angular dependence not present for the two-bladed configuration. The upper limits for the advance ratio boundaries of the four-bladed rotors increased with increasing rotational speed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} several {{characteristics}} of helicopter <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> upon human annoyance are examined. <b>Blade</b> <b>slap</b> noise was simulated by using continuous and impulsive noises characterized by five parameters: The number of sine waves {{in a single}} impulse; {{the frequency of the}} sine waves; the impulse repetition frequency; the sound pressure level (SPL) of the continuous noise; and the idealized crest factor of the impulses. Ten second samples of noise were synthesized with each of the five parameters at representative levels. The annoyance of each noise was judged by 40 human subjects. Analysis of the subjective data indicated that each of the five parameters had a statistically significant effect upon the annoyance judgments. The impulse crest factor and SPL of the continuous noise had very strong positive relationships with annoyance. The other parameters had smaller, but still significant, effects upon the annoyance judgments...|$|E
40|$|The {{infrasonic}} signatures {{generated by}} the main <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> rate of a helicoper were used {{in an effort to}} detect infrasound generated by clear air turbulence. The artificially produced infrasound and the response of the data acquisition system used are analyzed. Flight procedures used by the pilot are described and the helicopter flight information is tabulated. Graphs show the relative frequency amplitudes obtained at various microphone locations...|$|E
40|$|Several {{methods for}} {{adjusting}} EPNL {{to account for}} its underestimate of judged annoyance are applied to eight helicopter flyover noise signatures having various degrees of <b>blade</b> <b>slap.</b> A proposal for an impulsive noise correlation procedure based on a digital analysis of the flyover signal is investigated. When all data are combined, the proposal is little better than simply adding an arbitrary fixed adjustment of 3 decibels to EPNL...|$|E
40|$|Full-scale {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on the Langley helicopter rotor test facility {{as part of a}} study {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a turbulent blade tip air mass injection system in alleviating the impulsive noise (<b>blade</b> <b>slap)</b> caused by blade-vortex interaction. Although blade-slap conditions could not be induced during these tests, qualitative results from flow visualization studies using smoke showed that the differential velocity between the jet velocity and the rotor tip speed was a primary parameter controlling the vortex modification...|$|E
40|$|Several {{expressions}} for {{the determination}} of the acoustic field of moving bodies are presented. The analysis is based on the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation. Applying some proposed criteria, one of these expressions is singled out for numerical computation of acoustic pressure signature. The compactness of sources is not assumed and the main results are not restricted by the observer position. The distinction between compact and noncompact sources on moving surfaces is discussed. Some thickness noise calculations of helicopter rotors and comparison with experiments are included which suggest this mechanism as the source of high-speed <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> of rotors...|$|E
40|$|Description of {{a single}} unified theory to account {{generally}} for the discrete radiation from the whole family of heavily loaded axial flow rotors, including helicopter rotors, propellers, and compressors. The approach used is to analyze, in a Fourier way, the periodic blade loading variation (azimuth profile) into blade loading harmonics (BLH) and then sum the total radiation from each BLH. The basic differences {{between high and low}} solidity rotor spectrums are considered, emphasizing the difference between subsonic and supersonic rotor noise. The special effect of helicopter <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> and compressor rotor-stator interaction is discussed, and measured rotor spectrums have been included to help illustrate the theory...|$|E
40|$|A new {{formulation}} of helicopter rotor thickness, noise for hover and forward flight, is discussed. The parameters required for this formulation are rotor motion, planform and airfoil thickness distribution. A computer {{program has been}} developed to calculate the pressure signature due to blade thickness for a helicopter in arbitrary motion. Comparison with high-speed helicopter tests shows good agreement with calculations when the observer is {{in or near the}} horizontal plane in which the rotor disk lies. Characteristics of thickness noise are illustrated by numerical examples indicating strongly that the high-speed <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> may be due primarily to the thickness effect. The methods of Deming and Arnoldi are discussed as the special cases of this technique...|$|E
40|$|The noise {{generated}} from a 1 / 4 -scale AH- 1 G helicopter configuration {{was investigated in}} the Langley V/STOL tunnel. Microphones were installed in positions scaled to those for which flight test data were available. Model and tunnel conditions were carefully set to properly scaled flight conditions. Data presented indicate {{a high degree of}} similarity between model and flight test results. It was found that the pressure time history waveforms are very much alike in shape and amplitude. <b>Blade</b> <b>slap</b> when it occurred seemed to be generated in about the same location in the rotor disk as on the flight vehicle. If model and tunnel conditions were properly matched, including inflow turbulence characteristics, the intensity of the blade-slap impulse seemed to correlate well with flight...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} several {{characteristics}} of <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> noise on annoyance response were studied. These characteristics or parameters were the {{sound pressure level}} of the continuous noise used to simulate helicopter broadband noise, the ratio of impulse peak to broadband noise or crest factor, the number of pressure excursions comprising an impulse event, {{the rise and fall}} time of the individual impulses, and the repetition frequency of the impulses. Analyses were conducted to determine the correlation between subjective response and various physical measures for the range of parameters studied. A small but significant improvement in the predictive ability of PNL was provided by an A-weighted crest factor correlation. No significant improvement in predictive ability was provided by a rate correction...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} analysis {{was developed to}} determine the airloads on helicopter rotors operating under near-hovering flight conditions capable of producing impulsive noise. A computer program was written in which the solutions for the rotor tip vortex geometry, inflow, aeroelastic response, and airloads are solved in a coupled manner at sequential time steps, {{with or without the}} influence of an imposed steady ambient wind or transient gust. The program was developed for future applications in which predicted airloads would be incorporated in an acoustics analysis to attempt to predict and analyze impulsive noise (<b>blade</b> <b>slap).</b> The analysis was applied to a hovering full-scale rotor for which impulsive noise was recorded in the presence of ambient wind. The predicted tip vortex coordinates are in reasonable agreement with the test data, and the blade airload solutions converged to a periodic behavior for an imposed steady ambient wind conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{potential}} {{cause of}} helicopter impulsive noise, commonly called <b>blade</b> <b>slap,</b> is the unsteady lift fluctuation on a rotor blade due to {{interaction with the}} vortex trailed from another blade. The relationship between vortex structure {{and the intensity of}} the acoustic signal is investigated. The analysis is based on a theoretical model for blade/vortex interaction. Unsteady lift on the blades due to blade/vortex interaction is calculated using linear unsteady aerodynamic theory, and expressions are derived for the directivity, frequency spectrum, and transient signal of the radiated noise. An inviscid rollup model is used to calculate the velocity profile in the trailing vortex from the spanwise distribution of blade tip loading. A few cases of tip loading are investigated, and numerical results are presented for the unsteady lift and acoustic signal due to blade/vortex interaction. The intensity of the acoustic signal is shown to be quite sensitive to changes in tip vortex structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{impulsive}} noise associated with helicopter flight due to Blade-Vortex Interaction, sometimes called <b>blade</b> <b>slap</b> is analyzed {{especially for the}} case of a close encounter of the blade-tip vortex with a following blade. Three parts of the phenomena are considered: the tip-vortex structure generated by the rotating blade, the unsteady pressure produced on the following blade during the interaction, and the acoustic radiation due to the unsteady pressure field. To simplify the problem, the analysis was confined to the situation where the vortex is aligned parallel to the blade span in which case the maximum acoustic pressure results. Acoustic radiation due to the interaction is analyzed in space-fixed coordinates and in the time domain with the unsteady pressure on the blade surface as the source of chordwise compact, but spanwise non-compact radiation. Maximum acoustic pressure is related to the vortex core size and Reynolds number which are in turn functions of the blade-tip aerodynamic parameters. Finally noise reduction and performance are considered...|$|E
