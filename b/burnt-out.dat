5|$|According to Herodotus, {{after the}} loss of the battle Xerxes {{attempted}} to build a causeway across the channel to attack the Athenian evacuees on Salamis, but this project was soon abandoned. With the Persians' naval superiority removed, Xerxes feared that the Allies might sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges. His general Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a hand-picked group of troops, while Xerxes retreated to Asia with the bulk of the army. Mardonius over-wintered in Boeotia and Thessaly; the Athenians were thus able to return to their <b>burnt-out</b> city for the winter.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{after this}} loss Xerxes {{attempted}} {{to build a}} causeway across the straits to attack Salamis (although Strabo and Ctesias place this attempt before the battle). In any case this project was soon abandoned. With the Persians' naval superiority removed, Xerxes feared that the Greeks might sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges. According to Herodotus, Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a hand-picked group of troops, while advising Xerxes to retreat to Asia with {{the bulk of the}} army.

5|$|Herschel Shmoikel Pinchas Yerucham Krustofsky, {{better known}} as Krusty the Clown (sometimes spelled as Krusty the Klown), is a cartoon {{character}} in the animated television series The Simpsons. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. He is the long-time clown host of Bart and Lisa's favorite TV show, a combination of kiddie variety television hijinks and cartoons including The Itchy & Scratchy Show. Krusty is often portrayed as a cynical, <b>burnt-out,</b> addiction-riddled smoker who is made miserable by show business but continues on anyway. He {{has become one of}} the most common characters outside of the main Simpson family and has been the focus of several episodes, most of which also spotlight Bart.|$|E
5|$|Reporting to the {{training}} camp, Mulan is able to pass as a man, although her military skills are initially inexperienced. Mushu provides clumsy guidance to Mulan on how to behave like a man. Under the command of Captain Li Shang, she and her fellow recruits Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po, gradually become trained warriors. Desiring to see Mulan succeed, Mushu creates a fake order from Shang's father, General Li, ordering Shang to follow the main Imperial Army into the mountains. The reinforcements set out, but arrive at a <b>burnt-out</b> encampment and discover that General Li and his troops have been massacred by the Huns.|$|E
5|$|The fleet sailed further south, {{and by the}} end of May {{encountered}} the Santa Clara, an armed, 600-ton Spanish galleon, just off Cape St. Vincent. The English captured the ship after heavy resistance, taking whatever goods the Spanish had failed to retrieve from her <b>burnt-out</b> hull. She was carrying a large amount of ironware valued at £7,000 and was sailing to Sanlúcar de Barrameda where further freight was destined for the West Indies. With the capture, the fleet separated, leaving the prize and goods in the hands of Frobisher and Clifford.|$|E
5|$|Blade Runner is a 1982 American neo-noir {{science fiction}} film {{directed}} by Ridley Scott, written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, and starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, and Edward James Olmos. It is a loose {{adaptation of the}} 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick. Set in a dystopian Los Angeles in 2019, the film depicts {{a future in which}} synthetic humans known as replicants are bioengineered to work on off-world colonies. When a fugitive group of replicants led by Roy Batty (Hauer) escape back to Earth, <b>burnt-out</b> cop Rick Deckard (Ford) reluctantly agrees to hunt them down. During his investigations, Deckard meets Rachael (Young), an advanced replicant who causes him to question his mission.|$|E
5|$|After the {{repeated}} German counterattacks prevented any lasting roadblock Truscott finally allowed reinforcements from the 45thDivision to support Dahlquist at Montélimar, {{as he felt}} the successful operations further south at the French ports allowed him to refocus to the north. At the same time, the Germans also reinforced their fighting force. Over the next days a stalemate emerged, with the Allies unable to block the retreat route and the Germans unable to clear {{the area of the}} Allied forces. Both sides became increasingly frustrated during the fighting, with attack, counterattack, and spoiling attacks, which made it hard for the 36thDivision to launch a decisive offensive. Whilst the 36thDivision had surrounded the 19thArmy, they themselves were almost surrounded, too, during the chaotic fighting, with only a thin supply route to the east open, resulting in their having to fight to the front and the rear. As the 36thDivision was seemingly making no progress, an angry Truscott arrived at Dahlquist's headquarters on 26August to relieve him of command. However, on seeing the heavy terrain and shattered forces, he refrained and left the headquarters again. Finally, during 26–28August, the majority of the German forces were able to escape, leaving behind 4,000 <b>burnt-out</b> vehicles and 1,500 dead horses. On 29August the Allies captured Montélimar, and the final German troops trying to break out surrendered. The Germans suffered 2,100 battle casualties plus 8,000 POWs, while the Americans had 1,575 casualties. Total POW losses of the 19thArmy now amounted to 57,000.|$|E
5|$|Mulan is {{initially}} misguided by Mushu who encourages {{her to go}} to war and in how to behave like a man. However, under command of Li Shang, she and her new friends at the camp, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po, become skilled warriors. Mushu, desiring to see Mulan succeed, creates a fake order from Li Shang's father, General Li, ordering Li Shang to follow them into the mountains. They arrive at a <b>burnt-out</b> village and discover that General Li and his forces have been wiped out by the Huns. As they solemnly leave the mountains, they are ambushed by the Huns when Mushu accidentally fired a cannon causing their position to be given away, but a second firing of a cannon by Mulan buries most of the enemy forces in an avalanche. Mulan is slashed by Shan Yu in his rage at her wiping out his army during the battle, and she is forced to reveal her deception when she receives medical attention. Instead of executing Mulan as the law states, Li Shang spares her life for saving his life from the avalanche by leaving her on the mountain {{as the rest of the}} army departs for the Imperial City to report the news of the Huns' demise. However, the avalanche failed to eliminate all the enemies, as Mulan catches sight of a small number of surviving Huns, including Shan Yu, making their way to the City, intent on capturing the Emperor.|$|E
25|$|During the 13 May Riots in 1969 many shops {{owned by}} local Chinese in Bangsar were burnt. Unsuspecting road users passing Bangsar {{on their way}} to Petaling Jaya were ambushed leaving Jalan Bangsar {{littered}} with <b>burnt-out</b> cars and motorcycles.|$|E
25|$|Bringing Out the Dead is a 1999 American drama film, {{directed}} by Martin Scorsese and starring Nicolas Cage, showing forty-eight {{hours in the}} life of a <b>burnt-out</b> paramedic in New York's Hell's Kitchen. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Joe Connelly, a former New York City paramedic.|$|E
25|$|Churches {{may also}} do work {{to improve the}} {{physical}} infrastructure of the neighborhood. Churches in Harlem have undertaken real estate ventures and renovated <b>burnt-out</b> and abandoned brownstones to create new housing for residents. Churches have fought {{for the right to}} operate their own schools in place of the often inadequate public schools found in many black neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|Birmingham's {{professional}} opera company – the Birmingham Opera Company – specialises in staging innovative {{performances in}} unusual venues (in 2005 it performed Monteverdi's Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria in a <b>burnt-out</b> ice rink in the Chinese Quarter). Its artistic director, Graham Vick, has also directed at La Scala, Milan, the Metropolitan Opera in New York and the Royal Opera House in London.|$|E
25|$|In North Belfast, several British Army patrols were {{harassed by}} gunfire and a bomb was thrown at an RUC base. An {{armoured}} vehicle {{was set on}} fire in Ardoyne, according to republican sources. Another one was <b>burnt-out</b> on Antrim Road. Late that evening in the Oldpark area, an RUC Land Rover became stuck in a barricade made of iron pilings and its crew had to flee when it was attacked with petrol bombs.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, {{the former}} Tredegar Iron Works {{facility}} overlooking the James River near downtown Richmond became {{the site of}} the main Visitor's Center of the Richmond National Battlefield Park. Sculptor David Frech of Newburgh, New York, was commissioned by The United States Historical Society of Richmond to commemorate the historic arrival of Abraham Lincoln and his son Tad Lincoln and their tour of the <b>burnt-out</b> Union-captured Richmond, Virginia, April 4, 1865, 10 days before his assassination.|$|E
25|$|The railway {{was opened}} on 4 November 1890 by The Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) and {{locomotive}} No. 10 carried a commemorative nameplate {{with the name}} Princess of Wales to celebrate its use on that occasion. There was soon a need for an additional two locomotives to operate the service. Nos. 15 and 16 were built by Siemens with a modified design of motor, which attempted to overcome the problem of <b>burnt-out</b> armatures that had plagued the line since its opening.|$|E
25|$|The {{disadvantage}} of hermetic compressors {{is that the}} motor drive cannot be repaired or maintained, and the entire compressor must be replaced if a motor fails. A further disadvantage is that <b>burnt-out</b> windings can contaminate whole systems, thereby requiring the system to be entirely pumped down and the gas replaced. Typically, hermetic compressors are used in low-cost factory-assembled consumer goods where the cost of repair is high compared {{to the value of}} the device, and it would be more economical to just purchase a new device.|$|E
25|$|In {{reaction}} to the desolation of the abandoned <b>burnt-out</b> buildings of the South Bronx, Fekner stenciled Last Hope in large letters above one crumbling structure so that every time you passed it you couldn’t block {{it out of your}} vision. Now you know you can’t change the world, but you can’t sit back and watch it implode either, so you’ll do your part, have your own little victory, and so will the next guy and the next, and maybe things will start to change.|$|E
25|$|Forested {{catchment}} areas supplying five of Melbourne's nine major dams {{were affected by}} the fires, with the worst affected being the Maroondah Reservoir and O'Shannassy Reservoir. As of 17 February 2009, over ten billion litres of water had been shifted out of affected dams into others. A Melbourne Water spokesperson said that affected dams {{may need to be}} decommissioned if the contamination from ash and other material were serious enough, and also said that forest regrowth in the <b>burnt-out</b> {{catchment areas}} could reduce runoff yields by up to 30% over the next three decades.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Catholic Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary {{was built}} between the years 1723-1724 in Baroque style {{at the place}} of the older <b>burnt-out</b> Gothic church. In 1772 the {{building}} was enlarged. In the interior of the church there is a late baroque wagon vault. The altar painting on the main classical altar illustrates the translation of the Virgin Mary being a masterpiece of Ferdinand Lütgerndorff from 1832. There was an older fortifying wall around the church with loopholes and round corner bastions from the 17th century. However, the wall was sadly pulled down in the 1950'.|$|E
25|$|The single {{candle in}} the left-front holder of the ornate six-branched {{chandelier}} is possibly the candle used in traditional Flemish marriage customs. Lit in full daylight, like the sanctuary lamp in a church, the candle may allude {{to the presence of}} the Holy Ghost or the ever-present eye of God. Alternatively, Margaret Koster posits that the painting is a memorial portrait, as the single lit candle on Giovanni's side contrasts with the <b>burnt-out</b> candle whose wax stub can just be seen on his wife's side, evoking a common literary metaphor: he lives on, she is dead.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 6th century several {{waves of}} Scythian invasions {{went through the}} Polish lands. The routes they {{traveled}} {{can be seen from}} the trail of the <b>burnt-out</b> Lusatian settlements they left. Dramatic material testimony of violent death and destruction was found among the ashes of a perished fortified settlement in Wicina near Nowogród Bobrzański. On the other hand, a golden Scythian treasure was discovered near a Lusatian settlement in Witaszkowo near Gubin – elements of arms and decorations patterned after zoomorphic Greek art motifs and dated 550 BC, probably booty seized from a fallen Scythian chief.|$|E
25|$|On 17 June 2017, MPs {{asked the}} council to {{describe}} why it had amassed £274 million of reserves, after years of underspending, and had not used any of its budget surplus to increase fire safety, given that residents had issued repeated warnings about the Grenfell Tower fire risk. The council actually used the surplus to pay top-rate council taxpayers a £100 rebate shortly before local elections which returned a Conservative council. After the fire, some former residents of Grenfell Tower still had rent payment taken out of their bank account for the <b>burnt-out</b> property by the council.|$|E
25|$|On a {{visit to}} Israel and the Golan Heights in 1972, Cornelius Ough, a {{professor}} of viticulture and oenology at the University of California, Davis, pronounced conditions in the Golan very suitable for the cultivation of wine grapes. A consortium of four kibbutzim and four moshavim took up the challenge, clearing 250 <b>burnt-out</b> tanks in the Golan's Valley of Tears to plant vineyards for what would eventually become the Golan Heights Winery. The first vines were planted in 1976, and the first wine was released by the winery in 1983. The heights are now home to about a dozen wineries.|$|E
25|$|Two similar {{accidents}} {{occurred in}} the following decade. Eastern Air Lines Flight 401 was a watershed incident in airline safety: on December 29, 1972, its entire flight crew became preoccupied with a <b>burnt-out</b> landing-gear indicator light and failed to notice that the autopilot had inadvertently been disconnected. As a result, the aircraft gradually lost altitude and eventually crashed. A similar incident occurred on December 28, 1978, when the captain of United Airlines Flight 173 was distracted by a landing-gear issue and did not heed his crewmembers' concerns about the aircraft's fuel level, resulting in an exhaustion of fuel to all engines and a subsequent crash.|$|E
25|$|Bushfires {{severely}} harmed {{the vegetation}} of the Cotter River Catchment and caused water quality {{problems in the}} three dams in the catchment: Corin, Bendora and Cotter Dams. For quite some time after the fires, turbidity in the water due to silt and ash from surrounding <b>burnt-out</b> forests meant Canberra {{had to rely on}} Googong Dam on the Queanbeyan River, which was not affected by the fires. Given the drought and existing water shortages, this effectively reduced Canberra's water reserves to around 15% for some time. An upgrade to the Stromlo Water Treatment Plant was subsequently required to allow extra filtration of water to cope with the diminished quality in the future.|$|E
25|$|Nick Spanos (28) and Stephen Melrose (24) were Australian lawyers, {{based in}} London. They {{were in the}} Netherlands on a four-day holiday with Vicky Coss (Spanos's girlfriend) and Lyndal Melrose (Stephen's wife). On the night of 27 May 1990, the two couples had a meal at a {{restaurant}} in the town of Roermond, near the border with Germany. The town was popular with off-duty British servicemen stationed in Germany; the Royal Air Force (RAF) bases of RAF Wildenrath, RAF Bruggen and JHQ Rheindahlen are nearby. As they returned to their car, at about 11PM, Spanos and Melrose were shot dead by two men clad in black with automatic weapons. The women were unhurt. The car used by the gunmen was found <b>burnt-out</b> in Belgium.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the rebel}} website Kavkaz Center, three {{detachments}} totaling up to 60 militants (and featuring ten suicide bombers) led by Emirs Zaurbek, Makhran, and Abdurakhman - commanders directly subordinate to Aslambek Vadalov - entered the village around 4:30 a.m. local time. The rebels overran two checkpoints and destroyed an armored personnel carrier before {{setting fire to}} ten of the homes of Kadyrov’s closest associates; they also seized ammunition and communications equipment. The militants {{were said to have}} employed the tactics of Afghanistan's Taliban, with groups of guerrillas attacking an object and inflicting as much damage as possible with no intention of retreating; some reports claimed that the militants “practically captured” the village for several hours and that the government had to revert to using artillery and helicopters to drive them out. During the fighting the militants managed to send an SMS message to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s North Caucasus service at 6:30 a.m. saying, “Tsentoroy is burning,” and television footage the following day showed a <b>burnt-out</b> car just 150 meters from the entrance to Kadyrov’s fortress-like residence, exhibiting just how deeply the brazen attack had penetrated the village.|$|E
500|$|Clisby {{was still}} wearing his RAAF uniform on 15May when he went into action with his flight against more than thirty Bf110s over Reims. Having {{destroyed}} two of the German heavy fighters, Clisby's Hurricane was seen going down with its cockpit trailing smoke and flames, evidently hit by cannon fire. He was initially posted as [...] "missing", along {{with one of his}} comrades, Flying Officer Lorimer, whose plane was also seen losing height in the same action. The French later found two <b>burnt-out</b> Hurricanes in the vicinity, which were identified as [...] Clisby's and Lorimer's. Clisby died without knowing that he had been awarded the DFC. A fellow pilot later said, [...] "He was an Australian and had thrown himself into the fray with a reckless abandon that was magnificent in its way".|$|E
500|$|Dilling visited Germany in 1931 and, {{when she}} {{returned}} in 1938, noted a [...] "great improvement of conditions". [...] She attended Nazi Party meetings, and the German government paid her expenses. She wrote that [...] "The German people under Hitler are contented and happy.... don't believe the stories you hear that this man has not done a great good for this country." [...] In 1938, she toured Palestine, where she filmed what she described as Jewish immigrants ruining the country. While touring Spain, then embroiled in the Spanish Civil War, she filmed [...] "Red torture chambers" [...] and <b>burnt-out</b> churches, [...] "ruined by the Reds with the same satanic Jewish glee shown in Russia." [...] She visited Japan, which she viewed as the only Christian nation in Asia, and in 1939, she returned to visit Spain, for a second time.|$|E
500|$|A {{wide variety}} of modifications, both {{official}} and fan-created, are available for Skyrim, generally made using the packaged Creation Kit. These [...] "mods" [...] might be distributed freely on file sharing sites like the Skyrim Nexus, or officially aggregated via the Steam Workshop's controlled content distribution mechanism. The mods include features such as a more vibrant night sky, new lighting systems, new characters and locations, user interface updates, and more. The first official Skyrim modification was The Fall of the Space Core, Vol. 1, created by Bethesda in collaboration with Valve Corporation. It causes the Space Core, a fictional device from Valve's video game Portal 2, to fall from the sky and land in a <b>burnt-out</b> house near Whiterun. The Space Core (voiced by Nolan North) acts as a non-player character, following the player around the world of Skyrim and dispensing space-related comments.|$|E
500|$|In April 1947 Cardus {{returned}} to England. He had not as yet {{decided to leave}} Australia permanently, but [...] "felt in need of spiritual refreshment". He found a war-weary England in which much had changed; familiar landmarks had disappeared, and old friends and acquaintances had died. The Free Trade Hall was a <b>burnt-out</b> shell, and the Queen's Hall in London completely destroyed; however, Cardus {{was struck by the}} apparent good health of the English music scene. He also found an undamaged Lord's, and enjoyed a season of magnificent cricket, marked by the batting exploits of the Middlesex pair, Denis Compton [...] and Bill Edrich. Cardus was back in Sydney {{by the end of the}} year, but early in 1948, having accepted an offer from The Sunday Times to cover that year's Test series against Australia, he left for England again.|$|E
500|$|Amir's diction was {{influenced}} by the need for rhythm and metre, as well as symbolism related to particular terms. This careful diction emphasised simple words as the basic unit and occasional uses of alliteration and assonance. [...] Ultimately he is freer in his language use than traditional poets: Jennifer Lindsay and Ying Ying Tan highlight his [...] "verbal inventiveness", injecting a [...] "lavishness of expression, a mellifluous of sound and meaning" [...] into his poetry. Siregar writes that the result is [...] "a beautiful wordplay". Teeuw writes that Amir had a complete understanding of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} Malay, mixing eastern and western influences, whilst Johns writes that his [...] "genius as a poet lay in his remarkable ability to resurrect the <b>burnt-out</b> embers of Malay poetry, and to infuse into the forms and rich vocabulary of traditional Malay an unexpected and vivid freshness and life." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2006, the Crown Fountain {{became the}} focus of a public {{controversy}} when the city added surveillance cameras atop each tower. Purchased with a $52million Department of Homeland Security grant, the cameras augmented eight others covering all of Millennium Park. City officials had consulted the architects who collaborated with Plensa on the tower designs, but not Plensa himself. Public reaction was negative, as bloggers and the artistic community decried the cameras as inappropriate and a blight on the towers. [...] The city said that the cameras would be replaced with permanent, less intrusive models in several months; it contended that the cameras, similar to those used throughout Chicago in high-crime areas and at traffic intersections, had been added largely for security reasons but also partly to help park officials monitor <b>burnt-out</b> LED lights on the fountain. The Chicago Tribune published an article on the cameras and the public reaction; the cameras were removed the next day, with Plensa's support.|$|E

500|$|On 20 November, Chamakh {{scored a}} goal in a 3–2 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur in the North London derby. A week later, he {{converted}} another goal, {{this time in}} a 4–2 win over Aston Villa. Following the goal against Villa, Chamakh went scoreless in the winter months, often appearing as a substitute in {{a majority of the}} matches. In matches he did start, he was often substituted on early in the second half.

500|$|Bernardi {{suggested}} East St. Louis, Illinois, {{because it}} was filled with old buildings [...] "that exist in New York now, and [...] have that seedy run-down quality" [...] that the team was looking for. East St. Louis, sitting across the Mississippi River from the more prosperous St. Louis, Missouri, had entire neighborhoods burned out in 1976 during a massive urban fire.
