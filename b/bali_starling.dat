25|$|The {{exhibit is}} opening in phases with phase one {{including}} a boat trip around the enclosures {{for visitors to}} view some of the zoo's key species from South East Asia, including Visayan warty pigs, southern cassowary, Javan banteng, lowland anoa and North Sulawesi Babirusa; plus a walk-through bird aviary featuring the critically endangered <b>Bali</b> <b>Starling,</b> as well as Java Sparrows, Pied Imperial Pigeons and Yellow-Backed Chattering Lorys.|$|E
25|$|There is less sexual {{dimorphism}} in plumage, however, {{with only}} 25 species showing such {{differences between the}} two sexes. The plumage of the starling is often brightly coloured due to iridescence; this colour is derived from the structure of the feathers, not from any pigment. Some species of Asian starling have crests or erectile feathers on the crest. Other ornamentation includes elongated tail feathers and brightly coloured bare areas on the face. These colours can be derived from pigments, or, as in the <b>Bali</b> <b>starling,</b> structural colour, caused by light scattering off parallel collagen fibres. The irises of many species are red and yellow, although those of younger birds are much darker.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Begawan Foundation made a {{decision}} to move all its captive breeding <b>Bali</b> <b>starlings</b> from Nusa Penida to a new site at Sibang, near Ubud. The breeding program then recommenced with the aim to research new release sites close by. During 2011, a total of 23 <b>Bali</b> <b>starlings</b> were donated to BF's breeding program. Three birds were donated by Jurong Bird Park, and 20 came from a variety of zoos across Europe, members of the European Endangered Species Program, whose contributions of birds meant that new genetic lines would be introduced when the imported birds were paired with the local birds held at the breeding centre in Bali.|$|R
50|$|The Bird Garden is a {{short walk}} on a {{meandering}} path. It features several aviaries with other enclosures opposite. These feature different birds and smaller monkeys respectively. Such species include Von der Decken's hornbills, Swainson's lorikeets, <b>Bali</b> <b>starlings,</b> Geoffroy's marmosets, cotton-top tamarins, and golden-headed lion tamarins.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, {{there were}} three {{releases}} by Begawan Foundation at their site in Sibang. Three male birds and one female were released in April, {{with support from the}} local community. In June, Dr. Jane Goodall, during her visit to Bali, assisted in the release of two <b>Bali</b> <b>starlings.</b>|$|R
25|$|Much of Indonesia's {{deforestation}} {{is caused}} by forest clearing for the palm oil industry, which has cleared 18 million hectares of forest for palm oil expansion. This requires land reallocation as well as changes to the local and natural ecosystems. Palm oil expansion can generate wealth for local communities, {{but it can also}} degrade ecosystems and cause social problems. This makes Indonesia the world's fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Such activity also threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species, including 140 species of mammals identified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as threatened, and 15 identified as critically endangered, including the <b>Bali</b> <b>starling,</b> Sumatran orangutan, and Javan rhinoceros.|$|E
2500|$|If the pseudotooth {{birds are}} Galloanseres, phaeomelanins {{might be more}} likely to have {{occurred}} in their feathers, but it is notable that the most basal lineages of Anseriformes are typically grey-and-black or black-and-white. Among ocean-going birds in general, the upperside tends to be much darker than the underside (including the underwings) – though some petrels are dark grey all over, a combination of more or less dark grey upperside and white underside and (usually) head is a widespread colouration found in seabirds and may either be plesiomorphic for [...] "higher waterbirds" [...] or, perhaps more likely, be an adaptation to provide camouflage, in particular against being silhouetted against the sky if seen by prey in the sea. It is notable that at least the primary remiges, and often the other flight feathers too, are typically black in birds – even if the entire remaining plumage is completely white, as in some pelicans or in the <b>Bali</b> <b>starling</b> (Leucopsar rothschildi). This {{is due to the fact}} that melanins will polymerize, making all-black feathers very robust; as the largest forces encountered by bird feathers affect the flight feathers, the large amount of melanin gives them better resistance against being damaged in flight. In soaring birds as dependent on strong winds as the bony-toothed birds were, black wingtips and perhaps tails can be expected to have been present.|$|E

50|$|In November 2012, Begawan Foundation {{released}} four {{pairs of}} <b>Bali</b> <b>starlings</b> at its breeding site in Sibang. These birds were observed and their daily habits recorded by {{staff of the}} Foundation and students of the adjacent Green School. A program of conservation was undertaken with the local villages prior to the release and has {{the full support of}} the King of Sibang. Each bird has been ringed in order to identify it as it adapts to life in the wild. As this was a soft release, the birds often take the opportunity to return to the breeding site to find food and water. However, it is evident that new sources of fruit and a variety of insects are available in the immediate vicinity that provide a full and healthy diet for these birds and their offspring.|$|R
40|$|Bali {{is a small}} {{beautiful}} tropical {{island of}} Indonesia archipelago lies betweens the continent of Asia and Australia {{as well as the}} Indian and Pacific Ocean. As a tropical archipelago, of course, many kinds of biodiversity can be found over there. In the island of Bali in particular, there are typical animal diversity that could not be investigated beyond such island, such as, Bali cattle, Bali dog, <b>Bali</b> white <b>starling</b> and others. As time goes on, the existance of such biodiversity decreases in both quality and quantity. Both global warming/climate change and land use change are the main factors affecting such phenomenon. This study has been conducted by employing field observation as well as literature study. It was found that, the quality of purebred Bali cattle species decreases genetically that could be notified of smaller bodysize for both male and female. Land use change of agriculture activity to the hotels, house of living, roads and other infrastructures are the main factors for Bali cattle existancy. For typical famous bird of white starling, the problem is because of deforestation which cause natural habitat loss, due to land use change for agricultural activity and house building by local people. In case of Bali dog, the mad dog of rabies is just introduce and spreading over Bali island, whichis formerly the island of Bali has been recognised as free zone area of the rabies. As consequency, suffering dogs must be eliminated by a mass killing cause decrease total number of such poor dog. Overall, it could be concluded that environmental degradations of land use change, deforestation and desease are the main causes of biodiversity decreasing number of the Bali cattle, <b>Bali</b> white <b>starling</b> and <b>Bali</b> dog respectively, beside global warming/climate change natural disaster...|$|R

50|$|The Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi), {{also known}} as Rothschild's mynah, <b>Bali</b> <b>starling,</b> or Bali mynah, locally known as jalak Bali, is a {{medium-sized}} (up to 25 cm long), stocky myna, almost wholly white with a long, drooping crest, and black tips on the wings and tail. The bird has blue bare skin around the eyes, greyish legs and a yellow bill. Both sexes are similar. It is critically endangered and fewer than 100 adults are assumed to currently exist in the wild.|$|E
50|$|The black-winged {{starling}} {{feeds on}} a variety of items, including fruit, nectar and insects. It feeds in small groups and in pairs, both in trees and on the ground. It roosts communally at night in groups, sometimes with other starling species like the <b>Bali</b> <b>starling.</b> It is a seasonal breeder, although the exact timing of the breeding season varies by location. Birds in west Java breed from March to May, but in east Bali the season is around June. They are apparently monogamous, nesting in a twig lined hole amongst rocks or in a tree.|$|E
50|$|In August-November 1987 the {{breeding}} facility in Surabaya Zoo was renovated. This facility comprised 29 aviaries with 16 endangered Bali starlings, {{found only in}} the western part of Bali island. In November 1987, the captive population was increased with the addition of 37 birds donated by zoos and private collections in the USA and by Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust. The success of {{the breeding}} program of the <b>Bali</b> <b>starling</b> at this zoo allowed the release of 40 starlings into the wild at West Bali National Park in June 2011.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 all 35 villages (now 41 villages) {{agreed to}} make bird {{protection}} part of their traditional regulations (“awig-awig”). Since then, the FNPF has rehabilitated and released various Indonesian birds, most notably the critically endangered <b>Bali</b> <b>starling</b> which is endemic to Bali but whose numbers in the wild had declined to less than 10 in 2005. After a two-year program by FNPF in which 64 cage bred birds were rehabilitated and released onto Nusa Penida, their number had increased to over 100 in 2009. Other released birds include the Java sparrow, Mitchell's lorikeet and sulphur crested cockatoo.|$|E
5000|$|A {{postage stamp}} was {{proposed}} {{to be issued}} by Indonesia on the rich flora and fauna of its provinces. It was proposed to issue 33 stamps in succession between 2008 and 2011. In 2008 the series issued represented the province of Bali with the stamp depicting floral species of Dysoxylum densiflorum, known as Majegau in Indonesian language. The stamp issue described the qualities of this species as [...] "one of woods commonly used for Balinese carving material thanks to its strength and beautiful colour and pattern". Majegau (Dysoxylum densiflorum) and <b>Bali</b> <b>starling</b> (Leucopsar rothschildi) of Bali {{are also part of}} this series.|$|E
50|$|There {{are more}} than 180 {{different}} species of birds, over 11 of which are endangered and several of these are critically endangered.

There is a flock of great white pelicans on pelican island, {{one of the largest}} free flying parrot aviaries in the world, a number of parrot species, a seashore themed aviary with a wave machine and a birds of prey area. Some of the other birds at Birdworld include the popular talking myna birds, of which they have one Javan mynas and one hill myna.|$|E
50|$|On November 8, 2011 a {{breeding}} {{center for the}} endangered <b>Bali</b> <b>starling</b> was officially inaugurated in Sibang, Badung Regency inside the Green School area with initial 73 starlings. 20 of the birds came from various zoos in Europe, another 3 came from Jurong Bird Park in Singapore, and the other were already at the breeding center. If the breeding program gets success, {{some of them will}} be released into the wild, 4 of the breeding stock to Koelner Zoo and 3 to Jurong Bird Park. There were currently about 500 birds throughout Bali, 287 of them in breeding centers.|$|E

50|$|Reintroductions of captive bred populations {{can occur}} to {{replenish}} wild populations of an endangered species, {{to create new}} populations or to restore a species after it has become extinct in the wild. Reintroductions helped bring the wild populations of Hawaiian geese (nene) from 30 birds to over 500. The Mauritius kestrel was successfully reintroduced into the wild after its captive breeding programme. Reintroductions can be very difficult and often fail if insufficient preparations are made, as species born in captivity may lack {{the skills and knowledge}} needed for life in the wild after living in captivity. Reintroductions can also fail if the causes of a birds decline have not been adequately addressed. Attempts to reintroduce the <b>Bali</b> <b>starling</b> into the wild failed due to continued poaching of reintroduced birds.|$|E
50|$|The black-winged {{starling}} {{was once}} an abundant bird, {{so much so that}} it was considered a potential rival and threat to the threatened Bali myna. The species has declined, however, for much the same reasons as the <b>Bali</b> <b>starling,</b> principally collection for the caged-bird trade. The black-winged starling {{is one of the most}} popular species among collectors; in recent years the number of birds entering the trade has declined as they have become increasingly rare in the wild. In 2010 the species has been uplisted from endangered to critically endangered by the IUCN and it is believed that the population has declined by at least 80% over the last 10 years. The species is also potentially threatened by changes in agricultural processes, and scientists are also concerned about genetic variation being lost as escapees mix the three subspecies. Escapees of this species briefly formed a breeding population in Singapore, but that population is now thought to be extinct.|$|E
