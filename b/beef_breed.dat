Today {{it is the second}} largest French <b>beef</b> <b>breed,</b> behind Charolais and ahead of Blonde d'Aquitaine. In 2004, of about 900,000 Limousin cows, 63,000 were recorded in the Herd Book. At that time, 20,000 bulls were used for breeding, 10% through artificial insemination, and 1,600 were recorded in the Herd Book. France's Limousin herd grew by 2.6% in 2014 to 2.69 million heads as of Dec. 31, including 1.09 million cows.|$|E

2500|$|The UK once {{produced}} roughly as much beef as it ate, {{but this}} changed in 1996 because of {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE). [...] The BSE crisis led to regulations preventing animals more than 30 months old from entering the food chain, which meant cull cows {{could no longer be}} sold for beef. Just under 6 million cattle over this age were destroyed. [...] A Calf Purchase Aid Scheme, under which a further nearly 2 million calves were slaughtered, ended in 1999. In 2002, the UK produced 72% of the beef it ate. [...] Important beef cattle breeds include the Hereford, which is the most popular British <b>beef</b> <b>breed,</b> and the Aberdeen Angus. [...] The once-widespread Beef Shorthorn is now a relatively uncommon sight.|$|E

40|$|Low density {{chips are}} {{appealing}} alternative tools {{in order to}} reduce genotyping costs. Such a chip is already commercially available. The best way to use low density chips is to impute data to a more dense coverage such as the standard 50 K genotype. Two alternative in silico chips are presented and include markers selected to optimise Minor Allele Frequency and spacing. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare imputation accuracy of these custom low density chips with the commercially available 3 K chip. Three French dairy and <b>beef</b> <b>breeds</b> were studied: Holstein, Montbéliarde and Blonde d’Aquitaine with respectively 4, 037, 1, 219 and 991 50 K-genotypes. Markers were masked for the validation population in order to mimic a low density genotype. Imputation was realised with Beagle software. 95 % to 99 % of alleles were correctly imputed depending on the breed and the low density chip. Custom low density chip gave better results. The gain to use 6 K chip was found to be even higher for <b>beef</b> <b>breeds</b> such as Blonde d’Aquitaine. A low density chip with 6, 000 markers is a valuable genotyping tool that is suitable for both dairy and <b>beef</b> <b>breeds.</b> Such a tool can be used for pre-selection of young animals or large screening of the female population...|$|R
