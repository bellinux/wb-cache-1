5|$|In <b>Baghdad,</b> {{given the}} lack of firm and public {{leadership}} by Mirza Yahya, the Babi community had fallen into disarray. Some Babis, including Bahá'u'lláh's family, began searching for Bahá'u'lláh, and when news of a man living in the mountains under the name of Darvish Muhammad spread to neighboring areas, Bahá'u'lláh's family begged him to come back to <b>Baghdad.</b> On 19 March 1856, after two years in Kurdistan he returned to <b>Baghdad.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bajkam's {{unexpected}} death {{created a}} power vacuum in <b>Baghdad,</b> with disagreements between Daylamite and Turkish forces prompting the former {{to join the}} defeated al-Baridi. With their assistance, he marched on Wasit and <b>Baghdad,</b> capturing them, but was soon forced to flee due to the disorder that followed his usurpation of power. A Daylamite chief named Kurankij replaced him as de facto ruler of <b>Baghdad,</b> but he imposed tyrannical rule, and al-Muttaqi appealed to the former amir al-umara Ibn Ra'iq for assistance.|$|E

After the eighteen months in <b>Baghdad,</b> al-Maʿarri returned home for unknown reasons. He may have returned because his mother was ill, or he may have run out of money in <b>Baghdad,</b> as he refused to sell his works.

5|$|In March 2003, Carney {{joined the}} staff of Lt. Gen.

Upon arrival in <b>Baghdad,</b> he became critical of the plan set out by CPA, making clear that Iraq czar Paul Bremer's ideological vision was impeding progress that could have been made to stabilize Iraq. He left <b>Baghdad</b> two months after arriving in April 2003, disillusioned by an inability to execute a more pragmatic plan for Iraq's reconstruction. Carney returned to Washington where he made known his disagreement with the Bremer plan. In 2007,Under a significant reorganization of the Iraq reconstruction effort by the Bush administration that witnessed other policy dissenters return to <b>Baghdad,</b> Carney was asked by the State Department to return to the U.S. Embassy in <b>Baghdad</b> to oversee the overall U.S. effort to rebuild Iraq.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, back in <b>Baghdad,</b> Ibrahim faced desertions, rebellions and conspiracies, one {{of which}} {{involved}} his half-brother al-Mansur. Hasan ibn Sahl {{was able to use}} this turmoil and advance north, capturing Mada'in. As the months passed, discontent in <b>Baghdad</b> grew. Ibrahim's supporters, including Fadl ibn al-Rabi, began abandoning him, and in April and July 819 there was a plot to take Ibrahim captive and surrender him to al-Ma'mun's forces. Narrowly escaping from this conspiracy, Ibrahim abandoned the throne and went into hiding, opening the path for al-Ma'mun to reclaim <b>Baghdad.</b> On 17 August 819, al-Ma'mun entered <b>Baghdad</b> without resistance, and the political turmoil quickly subsided. Al-Ma'mun now set about to reconcile himself with the opposition: he rescinded the Alid succession, restored black as the dynastic colour, sent Hasan ibn Sahl into retirement, and recalled Tahir from his exile in Raqqa. Al-Ma'mun did however retain the title of imam, which became part of the standard caliphal titulature.|$|E

At the same time, {{an increasing number of}} Bábís considered <b>Baghdad</b> the new center for leadership of the Bábí religion, and a flow of pilgrims started going there from Persia.|$|E

5|$|Adud al-Dawla {{kept his}} court in Shiraz. He visited <b>Baghdad</b> {{frequently}} and kept {{some of his}} viziers there, one of them being a Christian named Nasir ibn Harun. Furthermore, he had several Zoroastrian statesmen who served him, such as Abu Sahl Sa'id ibn Fadl al-Majusi, who served as his representative of <b>Baghdad</b> before his conquest of Iraq; Abu'l-Faraj Mansur ibn Sahl al-Majusi, who served as his financial minister; and Bahram ibn Ardashir al-Majusi, {{who served as a}} Buyid official.

5|$|After {{a one-year}} rest, the {{headquarters}} of the 10th Mountain Division was deployed to Iraq {{for the first time in}} April 2008, along with the 4th Brigade Combat Team. The division headquarters served as the command element for southern <b>Baghdad,</b> while the 4th BCT operated in North <b>Baghdad.</b> The 10th Mountain participated in larger scale operations such as Operation Phantom Phoenix. The headquarters of the 10th Mountain Division is currently deployed to Afghanistan in support of OEF XV and transitioning to the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Al-Ma'mun {{chose to}} remain in Khurasan, however, rather than coming to the capital. This allowed the power vacuum which the civil war had fostered in the Caliphate's provinces to grow, and several local rulers sprang up in Jazira, Syria and Egypt. In addition, the pro-Khurasani {{policies}} followed by al-Ma'mun's powerful chief minister, al-Fadl ibn Sahl, and al-Ma'mun's espousal of an Alid succession {{in the person of}} Ali al-Ridha, alienated the traditional <b>Baghdad</b> élites, who saw themselves increasingly marginalized. Consequently, al-Ma'mun's uncle Ibrahim was proclaimed rival Caliph at <b>Baghdad</b> in 817, forcing al-Ma'mun to intervene personally. Fadl ibn Sahl was assassinated and al-Ma'mun left Khurasan for <b>Baghdad,</b> which he entered in 819. The next years saw the consolidation of al-Ma'mun's authority and the re-incorporation of the western provinces against local rebels, a process not completed until the pacification of Egypt in 827. Some local rebellions, however, notably that of the Khurramites, dragged on for far longer into the 830s.|$|E

5|$|Bajkam, having {{consolidated}} {{his control}} over <b>Baghdad,</b> now {{turned to face}} the threat posed by the Buyids. To this end, he strengthened his ties with the Baridis of Basra, by handing over Wasit, as previously agreed, appointing Abu Abdallah al-Baridi as vizier of the Abbasid court (although the latter remained at Wasit and did not visit <b>Baghdad),</b> and, finally, by marrying himself to one of al-Baridi's daughters. Bajkam's success against the Buyids was mixed: Wasit was saved from Buyid attack, and the Baridis led a successful campaign in Susiana, but an expedition into Jibal was crushed by the third Buyid brother, Hasan. The alliance with the Baridis quickly soured, however, as al-Baridi still maintained his ambition of replacing Bajkam, and ajkam was aware of this. In late August 940, Bajkam removed al-Baridi from the vizierate and launched an attack on Wasit, which the Baridis abandoned without resistance. In the meantime, the <b>Baghdad</b> was in turmoil as religious violence had become commonplace, with fanatical members of the Hanbali school imposing their tenets on the general populace.|$|E
