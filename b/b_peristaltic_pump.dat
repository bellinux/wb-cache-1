40|$|Acellular {{matrices}} {{derived from}} animal and human cadaveric donor vessels or other tubular matrices are appropriate {{candidates for the}} creation of tissue- en-gineered, small-diameter, muscular arteries. Engi-neering principles have been used to design a bio-reactor and the necessary auxiliary systems for the reconstitution of a previously decellularized vascular matrix. The bioreactor enables the attachment of cells to the luminal and/or exterior surfaces of the matrix. For the recellularization procedure, the matrix is situated within a sealed compartment in order to maintain a sterile environment. The matrix is rotated continuously to assure a spatially uniform re-constitution. The auxiliary systems that serve the bioreactor are: (a) an oxygenator, (<b>b)</b> <b>peristaltic</b> <b>pumps,</b> one for conveying the internal cell medium and the other for conveying the external cell medium, (c) motor and gearing to create steady and controlled rotation, (d) reservoirs for the containment of the two media, and (e) tubing to convey the respective fluids and to interconnect the bioreactor culture chamber to the various auxiliary components. A recellularized matrix produced by the bioreactor demonstrated its capabilities to reconstitute a previously decellularized scaffold...|$|R

In the present study, a <b>peristaltic</b> <b>pump</b> was used to pressurize the chamber (positive as well negative pressures) using atmospheric air. In the present paper, we discuss the development and performance study of an automatic pressurization system to calibrate low range (millibar) pressure sensors. The system includes a <b>peristaltic</b> <b>pump,</b> calibrated pressure sensor (master sensor), pressure chamber, and the control electronics. An in-house developed <b>peristaltic</b> <b>pump</b> was used to pressurize the chamber. A closed loop control system has been developed to detect and adjust the pressure leaks in the chamber. The complete system has been integrated into a portable product. The system performance has been studied for a step response and steady state errors. The system is portable, free from oil contaminants, and consumes less power compared to existing pressure calibration systems. The veracity of the system was verified by calibrating an unknown diaphragm based pressure sensor and the results obtained were satisfactory. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R

40|$|Pumping {{suspensions}} and pastes {{has always}} been a significant technological challenge in a number of industrial applications ranging from food processing to mining. <b>Peristaltic</b> <b>pumps</b> have become popular to pump and/or dose complex fluids, due to their robustness. During the transport of suspensions with <b>peristaltic</b> <b>pumps,</b> clogging issues may arise, particularly during transient operations. That is a matter of particular concern whenever the pumping device is used intermittently to generate flow only on demand. Further understanding of the transient dynamics of such systems and of the conditions that can lead to jamming would result in more robust <b>peristaltic</b> <b>pump</b> design. To achieve these goals, an experimental setup that simplifies the statorrotor assembly of a <b>peristaltic</b> hose <b>pump</b> was used. In this setup, a roller transfers momentum to a liquid suspension, upon application of a constant load. The evolution of the velocity of the roller was recorded for different concentrations of mono-dispersed spheres of different diameters. The flow is found not to be strongly dependent on the dispersed particle volume fraction, if the size of the suspended phase is comparable with the hose diameter. Conversely, the flow is strongly slowed down when their size is small and the particle concentration is increased. These findings could help improving the design of <b>peristaltic</b> <b>pumps</b> by a more appropriate sizing, given the diameter of the hose and that of the particles to be transported...|$|R
