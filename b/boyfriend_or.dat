500|$|The word cock {{was first}} {{recorded}} in {{use as a}} vulgar term for the penis in 1618, perhaps deriving {{from one of the}} word's other meanings [...] "a spout or short pipe serving as a channel for passing liquids through". It was once common in England for areas to be given names that reflected their function or the activity taking place within them. Local historian Brian Lewis believes that may be the explanation for the name that locals gave to the bridge during the late 19th or early 20th century: [...] " [...] would function {{in the same way as}} any 'monkey run', where you paraded up and down to find a <b>boyfriend</b> <b>or</b> girlfriend".|$|E
500|$|Jolie had {{a serious}} boyfriend for two years {{from the age of}} 14. Her mother allowed them to live {{together}} in her home, of which Jolie later said, [...] "I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my <b>boyfriend</b> <b>or</b> {{he was going to be}} with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way." [...] She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.|$|E
500|$|... "Amy's Choice" [...] {{was written}} by Simon Nye, {{who is known for}} writing the sitcom Men Behaving Badly. Nye {{attended}} read-throughs of previous episodes to capture the character and [...] "voice" [...] of the Doctor and Amy. Nye admitted to restraining himself in the change from comedy to science fiction, but said it was [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "hugely liberating". Showrunner Steven Moffat originally gave Nye the premise of the episode for it to fit in the series arc, which was to challenge the Doctor and Amy's relationship. Nye states that Rory's [...] "death" [...] scene is essentially where Amy realises her feelings for Rory. Nye wanted to prove that Amy really loved Rory, and he was [...] "not just a cypher <b>boyfriend</b> <b>or</b> fiancé".|$|E

The actor would even cause contestants to lose their actual jobs.|$|R
500|$|Toby Whithouse {{originally}} planned {{to write a}} different episode, but Moffat and Wenger thought it was too similar to other episodes in the series and Whithouse wrote [...] "The Vampires of Venice" [...] instead, while his original episode was pushed to the next series. Whithouse was asked to write [...] "a big bold romantic episode" [...] {{that would be a}} [...] "good jumping off point" [...] for new viewers to Doctor Who. Moffat figured that {{in the middle of the}} series a viewer could [...] "start watching it again" [...] and that it should be [...] "something romantic and funny". For the next episode, Moffat asked comedy writer Simon Nye to write a story that challenged the relationship between Amy and the Doctor. The episode, titled [...] "Amy's Choice", was intended to be Amy's decision between excitement with the Doctor or life with Rory. The scene in which Rory dies in the false reality was intended to be when Amy realised her feelings for him. Nye wanted to stress that Amy really did love Rory and he was not [...] "just a cypher <b>boyfriend</b> <b>or</b> fiancé".|$|E
500|$|In {{a segment}} of the Investigation Discovery series Deadly Women {{covering}} the Kinne case, episode entitled [...] "Born bad", James Hays, author of I'm just an Ordinary Girl: The Sharon Kinne Story speculates that Kinne committed her first murder for pecuniary gain, hoping to cash in on James Kinne's life insurance policy, and that she began to derive pleasure from killing at that point. Former FBI profiler Candice DeLong supports this assertion with her theory that Kinne is a sociopath, lacking in remorse and empathy, and therefore had no compunction about killing to get what she wanted — be it life insurance, marriage to her <b>boyfriend,</b> <b>or</b> cash. This idea is echoed by some of those involved in prosecuting Kinne, who feel that she was a [...] "psychopath" [...] and born bad. [...] and that [...] "her solution to a problem was to kill somebody". Even those who believe in her guilt, however, note that Kinne had a certain appeal, describing her as [...] "rather attractive" [...] and admitting that they grew to like her. The Mammoth Book of True Crime describes her as a relative rarity, a [...] "pretty" [...] criminal.|$|E
500|$|Mansfield's {{public persona}} and career image became another subject in popular culture. Francesca Lia Block's Weetzie Bat books often refer to Mansfield; their {{characters}} Dirk and Weetzie watch The Girl Can't Help It, and the Witch Baby's mother {{is part of}} a sinister cult that masquerades as a Jayne Mansfield fan club. In Lynda Curnyn's 2004 novel, Bombshell, the character Grace is advised not to become a Jayne Mansfield when it is suspected that she is pregnant without a <b>boyfriend</b> <b>or</b> a husband. Mansfield's films and events of her life also became subjects of inspiration in popular culture. In the 1963 movie, The Stripper, the aspiring stripper Lila Green, played by Joanne Woodward, is mistaken as Mansfield. In the 2005 novel Who Wrote the Book of Love? by Lee Siegel, Lucky Lee, an American boy in Southern California in the 1950s, becomes infatuated with Marilyn Monroe and Mansfield in his journey through sexual enlightenment. In the book Lucky Lee uses famous quotes from films and literature - like [...] "Wow! What a body!" [...] and [...] "Me Tarzan, you Jayne!" [...] In the book it is spelled Jayne instead of Jane, to make a pun to allude to Mansfield. Dutch writer Jan Cremer wrote a large part of his autobiographical novel I, Jan Cremer– III about their relationship.|$|E
50|$|Fool Around With is a British reality TV show, {{where four}} women or men are locked up {{together}} with a single person, who tries to determine which of the four contestants is also single; the other three contestants have <b>boyfriends</b> <b>or</b> girlfriends.

50|$|Chants are {{intended}} to structure the game and are secondary, explaining the nonsense or irrational lyrics. These chants are unusual inasmuch as they were transmitted from child to child usually without an underlying reason, as opposed to nursery rhymes which were transmitted from adult to child and often contained a moral. Chants may contain girlish references to <b>boyfriends</b> <b>or</b> marriage.|$|R

500|$|Ali Shadman {{is one of}} the few Kurdish people {{remaining}} in Baghdad. His family are struggling financially and resort to siphoning petrol from their car to run their back-up generator when the power grid fails. When the generator breaks down one night, Ali begins to wonder why he is fixing it against a backdrop of gunfire, instead of studying in peace. Another night, he reports the neighbourhood's news but explains there is nothing to speak of other than the usual explosions, violence, and death. Anmar Refat, a Syriac Christian, tries to remain philosophical and hopes that armed gangs will not attack the school. His family, however, are more nervous about any nearby gunfire, as their Christian beliefs increase the threat to their lives if anyone were to find out about them. Anmar has a girlfriend, whom he can contact only via his mobile phone, but he has not heard from her in several days, leaving him worried about whether she has found another <b>boyfriend,</b> <b>or</b> has been hurt in the violence. Hayder Khalid, a Shia Muslim, hopes to become a famous singer-songwriter. He frequently downloads music videos of English-language pop music so he can learn popular English songs and dance moves. Mohammad Raed, a Sunni Muslim, is the [...] at school, who prefers playing sports and fooling around with his friends to studying. Unaware of his behaviour at school, his mother believes he is hard-working, self-sufficient and mature, and believes he will graduate and go to university.|$|E
500|$|Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad {{said that}} he was not certain if [...] "this was a great 30 Rock episode" [...] but that it [...] "had all of the {{elements}} that make the good ones: funny one-liners and Liz and Jack both looking for something better in their lives." [...] He was complimentary towards Matt Damon's appearance, writing that he [...] "was {{one of the best things}} about this season finale episode", but admitted he could not see Damon [...] "being Liz's <b>boyfriend</b> <b>or</b> husband next season." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin wrote that he enjoyed Kenneth's rant against his former co-workers, and said that this episode [...] "was a terrific end to a season that wobbled for a while but ended strongly." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste magazine said that Kenneth's story was [...] "an enjoyable diversion". In regard to the finale, itself, Gandert noted that it was [...] "pretty good, but not outstanding, which is a fitting way to conclude a season that never quite hit its stride but was still consistently entertaining." [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Emily Exton noted that Damon's character was a [...] "perfect match" [...] for Liz. Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, wrote that Damon was [...] "perfectly Damon-esque". Blake reported that she had been rooting for the Avery character since first appearing in the series, but acknowledged [...] "that there's something undeniably sweet about Jack and Nancy." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning complimented Julianne Moore's performance, writing that she was [...] "engaging". Canning said that Kenneth and Jenna's plots [...] "added more hilarity to the episode" [...] and that on their own [...] "these storylines [...] very entertaining. But combine them into one fantastic, fast and funny half hour and you're left with near perfection." [...] Alexandra Martell of New York magazine said that Avery's pregnancy was [...] "going to drive much of next season, but if that means more Elizabeth Banks, we're cool." [...] Martell wrote that Kenneth getting fired was a [...] "nice twist", but that [...] "the highlight" [...] of [...] "I Do Do" [...] was Jenna discovering Paul dressing up as Cher. TV Guides Adam Mersel opined that the [...] "biggest twist in the series' history" [...] was Nancy revealing that Avery was pregnant.|$|E

5000|$|Moody, Dorris and Blackwell (2008) {{concluded}} {{that in addition}} to race and class, factors such as supposed attractiveness, body size and youthfulness function as unfair criteria in the determination of newsworthiness in coverage of missing women. Also noteworthy was that news coverage of missing black women was more likely to focus on the victim’s baggage, such as abusive <b>boyfriends</b> <b>or</b> a troubled past, while coverage of white women tends to focus on their roles as mothers or daughters.|$|R

2500|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a {{positive}} review and welcomed Barr back to television.

The fact that she's completely unafraid to hold herself up to ridicule endears her to her audience". [...] He also noted that a reality show format [...] "probably fits Barr better than, say, another sitcom [...] ". He ended his review saying, [...] "The wild pigs might not want to stick around, but the rest of us should be willing to give Roseanne's Nuts a shot for a few episodes, at least. [...] Scott D. Pierce of The Salt Lake Tribune said in his review, [...] "As reality shows go, Roseanne's Nuts is pretty mild. Oh, she's bleeped a lot. And there's some blurring of nudity. (Ick.)

Most do not operate as brothels, but are instead venues for inexpensive drinks (usually just beer and tequila), live music, and dancing. Some are staffed with women who dance with customers for a few pesos. They provide an inexpensive environment for local males (and occasionally couples) to relax, listen to Cumbia, Norteño, or Ranchera music, and dance late into the night. Several are patronized by off-duty prostitutes and their <b>boyfriends</b> <b>or</b> husbands after working hours in the early morning.|$|R

2500|$|Yorke was {{initially}} unconvinced at the Jackson paedophilia storyline proposal. He [...] commented to The Guardian in 2008, [...] "My standpoint {{has always been}} {{that there has to be}} a good editorial justification. If it's just entertainment, or just sensation, or just the bogeyman in this case, then I don't think that's a good enough reason." [...] However, Yorke was convinced by Santer who opined that [...] "it would be a talking point that could truly educate and inform". It was decided that Bianca's stepdaughter Whitney would be the character that Bianca's boyfriend Tony groomed for sex. According to Bianca's backstory, Tony was [...] "a Mancunian who [...] had one day given Bianca a lift home, three years before her return to Walford, and noticed, standing in the hallway, 12-year-old Whitney in her pyjamas." [...] EastEnders worked closely with NSPCC when devising the storyline. The NSPCC's statistics suggested that 11% of children under 16 experienced [...] "sexual abuse by a person known but unrelated to them, often a <b>boyfriend</b> <b>or</b> girlfriend, while only 5% have been interfered with by someone unknown or whom they had just met; 1% by a parent or carer; and fewer than 1% by a professional in a position of trust". Thus it was decided that Whitney, unrelated to Tony in any biological sense, would be his victim and that Tony deliberately targeted the Jackson family, wooing Bianca, in order to groom Whitney. This idea, according to a BBC researcher, was based on real life cases. The truth was revealed to Bianca in an episode that aired in December 2008, when Whitney confessed to her stepmother, professing to love Tony. There followed Tony's imprisonment and a court case in 2009. Palmer was widely praised by critics for her performance during the reveal episodes. The storyline prompted an increase in calls to the children's help-line, ChildLine. A ChildLine director, Julie Crossan, said, [...] "Child sex abuse storylines on programmes such as EastEnders also encourage children to speak out. As a result, more children now understand what sexual abuse is and are increasingly willing to turn to ChildLine for help." ...|$|E

Through semi‐structured in‐depth interviews with three adolescent self‐cutters, their family members, and their peers, the peers’ response to adolescents’ self‐cutting was explored. The findings showed that different peers had different types of influence, as well as different responses to self‐cutting. Close and supportive peers were usually the first to discover the self‐cutting. They were a source of help, communicating with parents, friends, teachers, and the adolescents themselves. In contrast, non‐supportive peers, especially <b>boyfriends</b> <b>or</b> girlfriends, created conflicts that seemed to provoke self‐cutting. The findings’ significance for social work intervention is also discussed. Department of Applied Social Science...|$|R
