Academic suppression might involve the <b>blocking</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds,</b> the denial of promotion or publication, outright harassment, the subtle undermining of reputation or, in extreme cases, dismissal. The more extreme manifestation of suppression was McCarthyism in the United States which to British eyes 2 ̆ 7 resembled totalitarian practices: the demagoguery, smear campaigns, informers, purges of the civil service and education system; the blacklisting of writers, artists, and entertainers; and incidents of book-burning 2 ̆ 7.

The three types <b>of</b> <b>Block</b> Grants are Emergency Shelter Block Grants (ESG), Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and HOME Investment Partnership Block grants (HOME). Sources are {{determined}} through data provided via HUD mandated report titled the Action Plan. Sources consist of annual New Allocations, Program Income and Reprogrammed funds. These Sources are summed and evaluated {{for each of}} the five years, and for a five-year total. Uses are determined by data provided by the Action Plan(s) and another HUD mandated annual report titled the Comprehensive Annual Performance and Evaluation Report(s) (CAPER). Uses are summed and evaluated {{for each of the}} five years, and for the five years, and for the five-year total. Specific categories of Use are also reviewed and analyzed, with emphasis placed on USE for Housing Activities. Uses per individual sub-grants (the City of Flint is considered the Grantee) and summed totals are compared and analyzed for discrepancies. The discovery of inconsistency in naming conventions and errors in mathematical computations, necessitated a mid-step of standardizing the data available from the public documents. Accurate knowledge <b>of</b> Use <b>of</b> <b>Block</b> Grant <b>Funds</b> was not possible utilizing only the public documents. The City <b>of</b> Flint <b>Block</b> Grants are then compared with Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA) grant awards made during this same time period, for Housing Activities, to Flint area organizations. These MSHDA grants are considered to be a means <b>of</b> increasing the <b>funds</b> available for Housing Activities, which is known as leveraging.
