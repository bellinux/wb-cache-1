25|$|Imbrication of the rectus muscles over a nonintegrated implant {{traditionally}} {{was thought}} to impart movement to the implant and prosthesis. Like a <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joint,</b> when the implant moves, the prosthesis moves. However, because the so-called ball and socket are separated by layers of Tenon’s capsule, imbricated muscles, and conjunctiva, the mechanical efﬁciency of transmission of movement from the implant to the prosthesis is suboptimal. Moreover, {{the concern is that}} imbrication of the recti over nonintegrated implants actually can result in implant migration. The recent myoconjuctival technique of enucleation is an alternative to muscle imbrication.|$|E
25|$|The {{shoulder}} {{consists of}} a <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joint</b> formed by the humerus and scapula and their surrounding structures - ligaments, muscles, tendons - which support the bones and maintain the relationship of one to another. These supporting structures attach to the clavicle, humerus, and scapula, the latter providing the glenoid cavity, acromion and coracoid processes. The main joint of the shoulder is the shoulder joint (or glenohumeral joint), between the humerus and the glenoid process of the scapular. The acromioclavicular joint and sternoclavicular joint {{also play a role}} in shoulder movements. White hyaline cartilage on the ends of the bones (called articular cartilage) allows the bones to glide and move on each other, and the joint space is surrounded by a synovial membrane. Around the joint space are muscles - the rotator cuff, which directly surrounds and attaches to the shoulder joint - and other muscles that help provide stability and facilitate movement.|$|E
2500|$|Canine hip {{dysplasia}} (CHD) is the irregular {{formation of the}} joint that joins the femur [...] the longest bone in the body [...] to the hip socket. The hip is a <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joint</b> and the femoral head must fit well into the socket for the joint to function properly. Early signs of CHD include a reluctance {{to go up and}} down stairs or to jump; difficulty rising or lying down; and bunny hopping when running [...] both hind limbs move together. CHD is among the principal orthopedic diseases in the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog; it is rarely severe and crippling. Unless x-rays are taken many owners are not aware that they have a dysplastic dog. A goal for raising a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog from puppyhood is to feed them so they mature more slowly than smaller breeds to help avoid hip and other orthopedic problems in adulthood.|$|E
50|$|In {{this kind}} of reduction, holes are drilled into uninjured areas of bones around the {{fracture}} and special bolts or wires are screwed into the holes. Outside the body, a rod or a curved piece of metal with special <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joints</b> joins the bolts to make a rigid support. The fracture can be set in the proper anatomical configuration by adjusting the <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joints.</b> Since the bolts pierce the skin, proper cleaning to prevent infection {{at the site of}} surgery must be performed.|$|R
50|$|For <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joints</b> (also {{known as}} spherical joints), the inner joint is {{a ball and}} the outer joint is a socket, both having holes leading to the {{interior}} of their respective tube ends, {{to which they are}} fused. The ball tip is a hemisphere with a ground-glass surface on the outside, which fits inside of the socket, where the ground glass surface is on the inside. <b>Ball-and-socket</b> <b>joints</b> are labeled with a size code consisting of a number, a slash, and another number. The first number represents the outer diameter in mm of the ball at its base or the inner diameter in millimeters {{at the tip of the}} socket, in both cases where the diameters are their maximum in the joints.|$|R
50|$|Steam was {{delivered}} to the cylinders via flexible tubing. Initially, this was a coiled copper tube but this would fracture {{after a period of}} use. Later locomotives had rigid connecting tubes with the necessary flexibility provided by metal <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joints</b> similar to those used in laboratory glassware.|$|R
2500|$|The {{shoulder}} joint {{is composed of}} three bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone) (see diagram). Two joints facilitate shoulder movement. The acromioclavicular (AC) joint is located between the acromion (part of the scapula that forms the highest point of the shoulder) and the clavicle. The glenohumeral joint, to which the term [...] "{{shoulder joint}}" [...] commonly refers, is a <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joint</b> that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body. The [...] "ball" [...] is the top, rounded portion of the upper arm bone or humerus; the [...] "socket," [...] or glenoid, is a dish-shaped part of {{the outer edge of}} the scapula into which the ball fits. [...] Arm movement is further facilitated by the ability of the scapula itself to slide along the rib cage. [...] The capsule is a soft tissue envelope that encircles the glenohumeral joint. It is lined by a thin, smooth synovial membrane.|$|E
2500|$|Unger’s {{subsequent}} {{solo exhibition}} at the Trans Hudson Gallery in 1997 featured five sculptures that display her strong interest in organic forms. [...] Shanks consists of three nine-foot vertical bony shafts, each with a rounded point {{on the floor and}} topped with a bulbous knob. [...] Two knobs, imitating the ball of a <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joint,</b> protrude just above the middle of each shaft. [...] The white hydrocal was roughly scarred to give the appearance of bone. [...] One critic got the impression that the sculpture was the leg bone of some huge prehistoric animal. [...] Another believed the sculptures were like stern goddesses gazing down on their followers. [...] The sculpture exemplified Unger’s inclinations – rational yet connected to nature, serene but passionate, rigorously formed yet playful. [...] Unger also included a wall-mounted sculpture titled Black Heart, a darkly poetic version of a heart that hovers without apparent support. [...] Its black scorched and pitted surface looks like damaged skin over muscle. [...] Its mythic presence is in line with the symbolism of the origin of emotion. [...] It suggests that life processes are just as metaphysical as they are scientific.|$|E
60|$|The upper {{portion of}} the {{compound}} vessel consisted of decks and quarters for passengers and crew and holds for freight. These were all comprised within a vast upper hull, which rested upon the lower hull containing the motive power, the only point of contact being an enormous <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joint.</b> Thus, {{no matter how much}} the lower hull might roll and pitch and toss, the upper hull remained level and comparatively undisturbed.|$|E
40|$|Many robotic in-parallel {{structures}} {{have been}} conceived as six-component force sensors. In general, they perform well for most applications but, when accuracy is a must, two main limitations arise. First, in most designs, the legs {{are connected to}} the base and the platform through <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joints</b> and the integrated effect of such elements becomes noticeable. Second, dynamical measurements might not be very accurate because the natural resonance frequency of the used structures is quite low even for relatively small dimensions. This paper discusses the development of a force sensor based on an in-parallel structure and shows how the above limitations degrade its behavior. Moreover, it shows how, using a tensegrity structure, both problems could be alleviated because <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joints</b> can be replaced by point contacts and the resonance frequency can be controlled by adjusting the tensions of the tendons...|$|R
50|$|For either {{standard}} taper <b>joints</b> or <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joints,</b> {{inner and}} outer joints with the same numbers are made to fit together. When the joint sizes are different, ground glass adapters may be available (or made) to place in between to connect them. Special clips or pinch clamps may be placed around the joints to hold them in place.|$|R
5000|$|A circumferentor {{consists}} of a circular brass box containing a magnetic needle, which moves freely over a brass circle, or compass divided into 360 degrees. The needle is protected by a glass covering. [...] A pair of sights {{is located on the}} North-South axis of the compass. Circumferentors were typically mounted on tripods and rotated on <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joints.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{would be}} {{difficult}} to paint the general disappointment at this sudden collapse of the experiment. A united groan burst from the party, including the patient, for it at once became apparent that a man with a wooden leg--to say nothing of two--could only walk on a hard beaten path, and as there were few such in the island, Rosco's chance of a long ramble seemed to vanish. But Zeppa and his son were not men to be easily beaten. They set to work to construct feet for the legs, which should be broad enough to support their friend on softish ground, and these were so arranged with a sort of <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joint,</b> that the feet could be moved up and down. In theory this worked admirably; in practice it failed, for after a staggering step or two, the toes having been once raised refused to go down, and thus was produced the curious effect of a man stumping about on his heels! To overcome this difficulty the heels of the feet were made to project almost as much behind as the toes did in front somewhat after the pattern of Ebony's pedal arrangements, as Rosco remarked when they were being fitted on for another trial. At last, by dint of perseverance, the wooden legs were perfected, and Rosco re-acquired the art of walking to such perfection, that he was to be seen, almost at all times and in all weathers, stumping about the village, his chief difficulty being that when he chanced to fall, which he often did, he was obliged either to get some one to help him up, or to crawl home; for, being unable to get his knees to the ground when the legs were on, he was obliged to unstrap them if no one was within hail.|$|E

2500|$|... – in {{the episode}} [...] "To the Lighthouse", John Henry plays {{with a few}} of the 2008 Mistika sets along with a Lego {{construct}} of Mount Valmai. The 2006 story is also discussed. In the later episode [...] "The Good Wound", Henry plays with the sets again. He also asks why God didn't use <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joints</b> when he humans, referring to the Bionicle building system.|$|R
40|$|Detecting the {{position}} {{and the level of}} joint impingement is often a key to a computer-aided surgical plan to normalize joint kinematics. So far for <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joints</b> most of the existing impingement detection methods are not efficient or only consider the collided points as the detection result. In this thesis, we present two efficient and accurate collision detection systems to detect and evaluate the impingement on <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joints.</b> Through the first system, we rapidly non-uniformly sample the object surface in the spherical coordinate system based on polygon rasterization and then globally check the distance differences between the objects to approximately estimate the impingement level; the second system has a similar design but is based on a uniform sampling method which can sample the object more adequately and reduce the memory cost by 20 %. We achieved the accuracy, the efficiency, and also the feature of providing overall impingement estimation and visualization on the joint surfaces. The first system is further applied in a real-time ROM observation simulation to flexibly check the location and the level of the impingement occurred during the motion...|$|R

50|$|Dongyangosaurus was a midsized sauropod, {{measuring}} approximately 50 ft (15 m) {{in length}} and 15 ft (5 m) in height. The dorsal vertebrae were characterized by eye shaped pleurocoels and low bifurcated neural spines. The sacrum consisted of six fused sacral vertebrae, a feature unique to Somphospondylans. The caudal vertebrae were procoelous (concave anteriorly and convex posteriorly), forming <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joints</b> with neighboring vertebrae. The pubis was shorter than the ischium. The obturator foramen was narrow and extended.|$|R
5000|$|Historically made {{of white}} oak, waxwood or Chinese red maple, modern staves are {{constructed}} from rattan, bamboo, various hardwoods or aluminum. For optimum fit, {{each of the}} three sticks should be about the length of the combatant’s arm (usually 60 cm - 70 cm) and have a combined diameter that easily fits in the hand. (usually about 1.25 in). These are connected by chains of rings (usually of five inches (127 mm)) modern versions use <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joints.</b>|$|R
50|$|Additional {{important}} features {{can be found}} in the vertebrae. The neck vertebrae were distinctly opisthocoelous (convex at the front and hollow at the back), forming <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joints</b> with neighbouring vertebrae. The tail vertebrae, on the other hand, were amphicoelous (concave at both ends). The dorsal neural spines were very high, like those of some later sauropods, unlike the low prosauropod neural spines. The lateral sides of the vertebrae were concave, but not deeply excavated (a structure known as pleurocoels) as in later sauropods.|$|R
50|$|The two powered {{trucks were}} {{connected}} {{together with a}} <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joint,</b> and the couplers were also attached to the trucks. The bodywork, therefore, {{did not take the}} load of the train. Each truck had outside bar frames, allowing more room for the traction motors and equipment. The front powered truck's frames extended forward and carried an outrigger truck and the heavy snowplows the units bore.|$|E
50|$|The {{reversing}} {{and hand}} brake gear {{were provided with}} universal joints. The steam and exhaust pipes had ball-and-socket joints, with {{the centre of the}} ball coinciding with that of the spherical pivot casting. The exhaust of the inner cylinders on the front power unit passed to the smokebox via a similar <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joint,</b> installed close to the universal joint. The exhaust of the rear power unit's cylinders escaped through the auxiliary chimney in the coal bunker.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first two}} {{locomotives}} were built at Swindon Works in 1849 for working trains on the steep and tightly-curved [...] South Devon Railway which {{at that time}} was operated by locomotives from the Great Western Railway. The frames only ran {{from the front of the}} flangeless forward driving wheels to the rear buffer beam. The bogie swivelled in a <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joint,</b> riveted to a gussett under the boiler barrel. The operation of South Devon Railway had been contracted by that company to Messrs Evans and Geach from 1851 [...] - [...] using new 4-4-0STs designed by Daniel Gooch - and so the Bogie Class found use on other parts of the Great Western network. In 1855 additional locomotives were built for the GWR by R and W Hawthorn.|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} of the fossilized remains led paleontologists {{to suggest that the}} group including modern crocodilians first evolved 30 million years earlier than previously thought, during the Cretaceous period on the supercontinent Gondwana. Analysis of the remains concluded that the vertebrae fit together as they do in modern crocodilians, via loose <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joints,</b> as well as a secondary palate similar to that in living crocodilians which allows them to let air pass into the lungs without entering the inside of the mouth.|$|R
25|$|At first glance, {{sea urchins}} often appear {{incapable}} of moving. Sometimes, {{the most visible}} life sign is the spines, which attach to <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joints</b> and can point in any direction. In most urchins, touch elicits a prompt reaction from the spines, which converge toward the touch point. Sea urchins have no visible eyes, legs, or means of propulsion, but can move freely over hard surfaces using adhesive tube feet, working {{in conjunction with the}} spines. Regular sea urchins don't have any favourite walking direction.|$|R
50|$|The well-preserved forelimbs are {{the most}} {{distinctive}} parts of A. simonsi. A broad scapula and a <b>ball-and-socket</b> shoulder <b>joint</b> is characteristic of cetaceans, but Ancalecetus lacks both.|$|R
50|$|Solenodons {{resemble}} {{very large}} shrews, {{and are often}} compared to them; with extremely elongated cartilaginous snouts, long, naked, scaly tails, hairless feet, and small eyes. The Cuban solenodon is generally smaller than its Hispaniolan counterpart. It is also a rusty brown with black on its throat and back. The Hispaniolan solenodon is a darker brown with yellowish tint to the face. The snout is flexible and, in the Hispaniolan solenodon, actually has a <b>ball-and-socket</b> <b>joint</b> at the base to increase its mobility. This allows the animal to investigate narrow crevices where potential prey may be hiding. Solenodons are also noted for the glands in their inguinal and groin areas that secrete what {{is described as a}} musky, goat-like odor. Solenodons range from 28 to 32 cm from nose to rump, and weigh between 0.7 and 1.0 kg.|$|E
