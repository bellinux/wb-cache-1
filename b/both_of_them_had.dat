5|$|On December 12, 1995, Ike and Clara Altgens {{were found}} dead in {{separate}} rooms in their home in Dallas. A Houston Chronicle article quoted a nephew, Dallas attorney Ron Grant, as saying his aunt Clara had been very ill with heart trouble and other health problems, and <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> long suffered from the flu. Carbon monoxide poisoning from a faulty furnace may also {{have played a role}} in their deaths. Altgens was survived by three nephews, and his wife by two sisters.|$|E

Bianchi qualified 19th for the , out-qualifying team-mate Max Chilton by {{three-quarters of a}} second. Bianchi overtook Pastor Maldonado, and Daniel Ricciardo on the first lap and he eventually finished 15th on his debut. He was 19th on the grid again in Malaysia, 0.3 seconds away from Q2. Bianchi fell behind the Caterhams {{at the start of}} the race, but moved up the order after the pit stops, eventually going on to finish 13th, ahead of his teammate, and both Caterhams. As of the Hungarian Grand Prix, Bianchi had beaten his teammate in all qualifying sessions and all races that <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> finished. In the Japanese Grand Prix he and Charles Pic of Caterham were given ten-place grid penalties for receiving three reprimands over the season, and at the race, his race ended early after a collision with Giedo van der Garde.|$|E

25|$|Atta and al-Shehhi both {{encountered}} {{some difficulty}} reentering the United States, on 10 January and 19 January, respectively. As neither had presented a student visa, <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> to persuade INS inspectors {{that they should}} be admitted so that they could continue their flight training. Neither operative had any problem clearing customs. After returning to Florida from their trips, Atta and al-Shehhi visited Georgia, staying briefly in Norcross and Decatur, and renting a single-engine plane to fly with an instructor in Lawrenceville. By 19 February, Atta and al-Shehhi were in Virginia. They had rented a mailbox in Virginia Beach, cashed a check, and then promptly returned to Georgia, staying in Stone Mountain. In mid-March, Ziad Jarrah was in Georgia as well, staying in Decatur. At the end of the month, Jarrah left the United States again and visited Sengün in Germany for two weeks. In early April, Atta and al-Shehhi returned to Virginia Beach and closed the mailbox they had opened in February.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{a strike}} began by local civil servants. He {{was called to}} hold talks with the strikers and {{successfully}} reconciled the dispute. When Queen Elizabeth II visited Hong Kong {{for the first time}} in 1977, in his capacity as the senior unofficial member of the Executive Council, he delivered the welcome speech to the Queen in the City Hall. In March 1979, he accompanied then-governor Sir Murray MacLehose to pay a secret visit to Beijing, where <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> a meeting with Deng Xiaoping. Knowing that the Communist China insisted on obtaining Hong Kong by 1997 and the British Government intended to give up over the issue of sovereignty, Sir Yuet Keung felt the future of Hong Kong was less assured. After the visit, he was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE), and retired from the Executive Council in 1980, choosing to fade out from the politics of Hong Kong.|$|E

25|$|Óscar Malherbe de León {{was born}} in Mexico on 10 January 1964. Before joining the drug trade, he was a shoeshiner and a car washer for several local drug lords. He then turned to car theft and was later {{recruited}} by the crime boss Casimiro Espinoza Campos (alias El Cacho) in 1976 and join the Gulf Cartel. Espinoza Campos headed a criminal cell in Matamoros that oversaw the area's auto theft industry, drug trafficking rings, protection rackets, and the cartel's score-settlings. By the 1980s, Malherbe's notoriety within the Gulf Cartel grew because he {{proved to be a}} cold-blooded and cunning assassin. At the age of 22, he was indicted by the Public Ministry of Matamoros (Spanish: Ministerio Público de Matamoros) and was alleged to have been involved in at least 10 homicides from 1983 to 1984. The name of the late Luis Medrano García, another leader in the Gulf Cartel arrested in 1993 in Ciudad Juárez, also appeared in the indictment. Medrano and Malherbe usually worked together by supervising the drug trafficking shipments in the corridor of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> from six to eight armed henchmen watching their backs inside a walled compound from where they hid and gave orders.|$|E
25|$|From 1711 to 1721, the Norwegian cleric Hans Egede petitioned King Frederick IV {{for funding}} {{to travel to}} Greenland and re-establish contact with the Norse {{settlers}} there. Presumably, such settlers would still be Catholic or even pagan and he desired to establish a mission among them to spread the Reformation. Frederick permitted Egede and some Norwegian merchants to establish the Bergen Greenland Company to revive trade with the island but refused to grant them a monopoly over it for fear of antagonizing Dutch whalers in the area. The Royal Mission College assumed superintendency over the mission and provided the company with a small stipend. Egede found but misidentified {{the ruins of the}} Norse colony, went bankrupt amid repeated attacks by the Dutch, and found lasting conversion of the migrant Inuit exceedingly difficult. An attempt to found a royal colony under Major Claus Paarss established the settlement of Godthåb ("Good Hope") in 1728 but was a costly debacle which saw most of his soldiers mutiny and his settlers killed by scurvy. Two child converts sent to Copenhagen for the coronation of Christian VI returned in 1733 with smallpox, devastating the island. The same ship that returned them, however, also brought the first Moravian missionaries, who in time would convert a former angekok (Inuit shaman), experience a revival at their mission of New Herrnhut, and establish a string of mission houses along the southwest coast. Around the same time, the merchant Jacob Severin took over administration of the colony and its trade and, having secured a large royal stipend and full monopoly from the king, successfully repulsed the Dutch in a series of skirmishes in 1738 and 1739. Egede himself quit the colony on the death of his wife, leaving the Lutheran mission to his son Poul. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> studied the Kalaallisut language extensively and published works on it; as well, Poul {{and some of the other}} clergy sent by the Mission College such as Otto Fabricius began wide-ranging study of Greenland's flora, fauna, and meteorology. However, though kale, lettuce, and other herbs were successfully introduced, repeated attempts to cultivate wheat or clover failed throughout Greenland, limiting the ability to raise European livestock.|$|E

500|$|Cotton later {{summarized}} some of {{the events}} in his correspondence. [...] In one letter he asserted that [...] "the radical voices consciously sheltered themselves" [...] behind his reputation. [...] In a March 1638 letter to Samuel Stone at Hartford, he referred to Hutchinson and others as being those who [...] "would have corrupted and destroyed Faith and Religion had not they bene timely discovered." [...] His most complete statement on the subject appeared in a long letter to Wheelwright in April 1640, in which he reviewed the failings which <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> committed as the controversy developed. [...] He discussed his own failure in not understanding {{the extent to which}} members of his congregation knowingly went beyond his religious views, specifically mentioning the heterodox opinions of William Aspinwall and John Coggeshall. [...] He also suggested that Wheelwright should have picked up on the gist of what Hutchinson and Coggeshall were saying.|$|E
500|$|While Allied leaders {{expressed}} {{mixed feelings}} on Patton's capabilities, the German High Command was noted {{to have more}} respect for him than for any other Allied commander after 1943. Adolf Hitler reportedly called him [...] "that crazy cowboy general". Many German field commanders were generous in their praise of Patton's leadership following the war, {{and many of its}} highest commanders also held his abilities in high regard. Erwin Rommel credited Patton with executing [...] "the most astonishing achievement in mobile warfare". Generaloberst Alfred Jodl, {{chief of staff of the}} German Army, stated that Patton [...] "was the American Guderian. He was very bold and preferred large movements. He took big risks and won big successes." [...] Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring noted that [...] "Patton had developed tank warfare into an art, and understood how to handle tanks brilliantly in the field. I feel compelled, therefore, to compare him with Generalfeldmarschall Rommel, who likewise had mastered the art of tank warfare. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> a kind of second sight in regard to this type of warfare." [...] Referring to the escape of the Afrika Korps after the Battle of El Alamein, Fritz Bayerlein opined that [...] "I do not think that General Patton would let us get away so easily." [...] In an interview conducted for Stars and Stripes just after his capture, Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt stated simply of Patton, [...] "He is your best." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 10, Giuliani held what The New York Times {{described}} as an [...] "extraordinary, emotional news conference" [...] in Bryant Park to announce that he was seeking a separation from Hanover, saying, [...] "This is very, very painful. For quite some time it's probably been apparent that Donna and I lead in many ways independent and separate lives." [...] Regarding Nathan, Giuliani said [...] "I'm going to need her now more than maybe I did before", making reference to his battle with cancer and her background in nursing. Regarding the senate race, he again did not commit to a decision, saying, [...] "I don't really care about politics right now. [...] I'm thinking about my family, the people that I love {{and what can be}} done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best. [...] I'm not thinking about politics. Politics comes at least second, maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all work itself out some way politically." [...] Giuliani had, however, neglected to inform Hanover in advance of his announcement; her reaction was {{described as}} distraught. [...] Three hours later, she held her own news conference at Gracie Mansion, where she said, [...] "Today's turn of events brings me great sadness. I had hoped to keep this marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with one staff member." [...] In this, she was making reference to Cristyne Lategano, the former communications director for Giuliani; Vanity Fair had reported in 1997 that Lategano and Giuliani were having an affair, which <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> denied. [...] Hanover continued, [...] "Beginning last May, I made a major effort to bring us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of our personal intimacy through the fall. At that point, he chose another path." ...|$|E
