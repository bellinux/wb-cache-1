500|$|In October 2011, Marvel Studios held a {{presentation}} at the New York Comic Con that featured new footage and a panel discussion including producer Kevin Feige and several cast members. The first full-length trailer was also released in October. Comic Book Resources said, [...] "The two-minute teaser handily establishes the movie's premise" [...] and is [...] "heavy on the assembling, but fans are also treated to plenty of action, as well glimpses [...] of Iron Man's new armor and, best of all, the new take on the Incredible Hulk. Naturally, Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark gets the best lines". However, The Hollywood Reporter called it, [...] "Awesome. Or it would <b>be</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> hadn't seen all of this before and expected every single thing {{that we saw in}} the trailer". The trailer, which debuted exclusively on iTunes Movie Trailers, was downloaded over 10million times in its first 24 hours, breaking the website's record for the most-viewed trailer. This record was surpassed by the trailer for The Dark Knight Rises, which was downloaded more than 12.5million times in its first 24 hours. The trailer received 20.4 million views in the 24 hours after it debuted. A second full-length trailer was released on iTunes in February 2012, reaching a record 13.7million downloads in 24 hours. The theatrical trailers of The Avengers appeared with many films, including , 21 Jump Street and The Hunger Games.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{successful}} {{action by the}} Conservative Party (UK) government the high court announced in July 2017 that the judicial review would be held in private and that evidence relating to the defence {{by the government and}} security services would neither be made available to Belhaj or his legal team nor made public. Criticising the decision Belhaj was quoted as saying that [...] "I went through a secret trial once before, in Gaddafi’s Libya. It took about a half hour, and I never saw any of the evidence against me. Later a guard came to my cell and tossed in a red jumpsuit – that was how I found out that the secret court had sentenced me to die" [...] and continued [...] "what kind of a trial will it <b>be</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> put in a mountain of evidence and government officials can simply refuse to answer us". In response, Straw stated that he was opposed to extraordinary rendition and had not been complicit in it.|$|E

2500|$|In the past, {{exposure}} to photos or articles were primarily found in traditional media; however, {{the accessibility of}} the internet today has resulted in an infinite array online. The world we inhabit is transpiring into a saturated place driven by imageries, which “force [...] standards of beauty than ever before”. One of the greatest influence the internet has on body image, {{is the creation of}} social media. Users are constantly bombarded by notifications, posts, and photos about the lives of others; “sending messages about what we could, should, or would <b>be</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> only purchased certain products, made certain choices, or engaged in certain behaviors”. Despite the ability to create and control content on social media, “the same unattainable body ideals we see in traditional media are also reflected in the online environment”. Over-engagement with social networking platforms and images will therefore, also “encourage a psychological adoption of unrealistic beauty ideals…, can lead to poor body image and low self-esteem".|$|E
2500|$|Throughout 1825, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs George Canning held {{discussions with}} Governor Pelly of the HBC as to a {{potential}} settlement with the United States. Pelly felt a border along the Snake and Columbia Rivers was advantageous for the United Kingdom and his company. Contacting American minister Rufus King in April 1826, Canning requested that a settlement be reached over the Oregon dispute. Gallatin was appointed Ambassador to the United Kingdom and given instructions by Secretary of State Henry Clay in July 1826 to offer {{a division of the}} Pacific Northwest along the 49th parallel to the British. In a letter to Prime Minister Lord Liverpool in 1826, Canning presented the possibilities of trade with the Qing Empire if a division of the Pacific Northwest was to be made with the Americans. He felt the recognition of American rights to ownership of Astoria, despite its continued use by the NWC and later HBC, was [...] "absolutely unjustifiable." [...] This diplomatic courtesy Canning felt weakened the territorial claims of the United Kingdom. A border along the Columbia River would give [...] "an immense direct intercourse between China and what may <b>be,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> resolve not yield them up, her boundless establishments on the N. W. Coast of America." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 11 August 2015, Prime Minister Abbott, in {{response}} to the cross-party bill to legalise same-sex marriage being introduced to the parliament, called a special joint party room meeting of the Liberal and National parties. The six-hour meeting resulted in 66 Coalition MPs voting against a free vote being held on same-sex marriage legislation and 33 voting in favour of a free vote. Abbott was accused by Christopher Pyne of [...] "branch stacking" [...] the party room by calling a joint meeting with the largely socially conservative Nationals, as this reduced the prospects of a free vote being endorsed. Following the meeting, Abbott announced that whilst the Coalition would maintain its position of marriage being defined as a heterosexual union {{for the duration of the}} existing parliamentary term, he stated it was his [...] "strong disposition" [...] to hold a national vote on same-sex marriage sometime after the 2016 federal election, either in the form of a plebiscite or constitutional referendum. Labor Party Opposition Leader Bill Shorten argued the proposal was a delaying tactic and would waste money, whilst recommitting to introduce a bill to legalise same-sex marriage within 100 days of taking office if successful at the 2016 federal election. On 17 August 2015, in defiance of Mr. Abbott, Liberal backbencher Warren Entsch introduced the aforementioned private members' bill, saying, [...] "a divided nation is what we will <b>be</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> continue to allow discrimination in relation to marriage on the basis of a person's sexuality." ...|$|E
