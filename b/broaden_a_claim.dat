40|$|Historically, <b>a</b> ???<b>claim???</b> {{has been}} the {{starting}} point for invoking the governmen contract disputes process. One of the elements of <b>a</b> ???<b>claim???</b> in that context is a???dispute???. However, a recent statute has declared that, under some circumstances, a ???dispute??? is a substitute for <b>a</b> ???<b>claim???</b> in reference to this initial jurisdictional step. It is a mathematical axiom that a whole must equal the sum of its parts. However, the above statute appears to defy that logic by declaring that a ???dispute???(one of the many requisite subparts of <b>a</b> ???<b>claim???)</b> can be used interchangeably or synonymously with <b>a</b> ???<b>claim???</b> (the whole). The statute did this in order to sidestep some established but cumbersome legal precedent interpreting the requirements of <b>a</b> ???<b>claim???.</b> This article examines the correlation between <b>a</b> ???<b>claim???</b> and <b>a</b> ???dispute??? within the government contract disputes process and whether this statutory substitution was a ???quick fix??? or a misguided attempt...|$|R

40|$|Remote sensing and GIS are {{complementary}} technologies that, when combined, enable improved monitoring, map-ping, {{and management}} of forest resources (Franklin 2001).

A forest inventory is a survey of the loca-tion, composition, and distribution of forest resources. As one of the principal sources of forest management informa-tion, these databases support a wide range of management decisions from harvest plans to the development of long-term strategies.
