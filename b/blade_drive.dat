60|$|What next {{happened}} happened suddenly, swiftly, terribly. Levi {{drew back}} a single step, and shot one quick, keen look to right and to left. He passed his hand rapidly behind his back, {{and the next}} moment Hiram saw the moonlight gleam upon the long, sharp, keen blade of a knife. Levi raised his arm. Then, just as the other arose from bending over the chest, he struck, and struck again, two swift, powerful blows. Hiram saw the <b>blade</b> <b>drive,</b> clean and sharp, into the back, and heard the hilt strike with a dull thud against the ribs--once, twice. The burly, black-bearded wretch gave a shrill, terrible cry and fell staggering back. Then, in an instant, with another cry, he was up and clutched Levi with a clutch of despair by the throat and by the arm. Then followed a struggle, short, terrible, silent. Not a sound was heard but the deep, panting breath and the scuffling of feet in the sand, upon which there now poured and dabbled a dark-purple stream. But it was a one-sided struggle and lasted only {{for a second or}} two. Levi wrenched his arm loose from the wounded man's grasp, tearing his shirt sleeve from the wrist to the shoulder as he did so. Again and again the cruel knife was lifted, and again and again it fell, now no longer bright, but stained with red.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of Gravely riding tractors are, like the walk-behinds, characterized as [...] "all-gear", that is, with a rear-mounted engine mated to a transaxle powering the tractor's rear wheels. This design thus {{eliminates the need}} for drive belts to power the tractor forward or backwards. The only belts required on Gravely equipment (with the exception of the 408) is the <b>blade</b> <b>drive</b> belt for its mower decks, which is powered by a gear box on the deck, which receives power from a PTO driveshaft connected to the tractor's drivetrain. The tractor's direction is controlled by a lever {{to the right of the}} operator for forward, neutral, or reverse operation. Because of this, this tractor is often mistaken for having a hydrostatic drive.|$|E
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} of {{turbine blades}} is often outsourced to investment casting foundries by aerospace companies that {{design and build}} jet engines. Aerospace companies have found that casting defects are an important cost driver in the price that they pay the foundries for the turbine blades. Defect types include porosity, stress, grain, fill, and mold-related defects. In order to address the defect problem, aerospace companies have adopted a design for manufacture approach to drive {{the cost of the}} turbine blades down. The principal research objective of this thesis was to discover how the critical part features on the turbine <b>blade</b> <b>drive</b> the number of manufacturing defects seen in the casting process. In the experiment, the dimensions of the critical part features were varied in order to quantify how the critical part features relate to manufacturing defects. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{drive system}} for a {{variable}} diameter rotor (VDR) system includes a plurality of rotor blade assemblies with inner and outer rotor blade segments. The outer blade segment being telescopically mounted to the inner blade segment. The VDR retraction/extension system includes a drive housing mounted {{at the root of}} each blade. The housing supports a spool assembly, a harmonic gear set and an electric motor. The spool assembly includes a pair of counter rotating spools each of which drive a respective cable which extends through the interior of the inboard rotor blade section and around a pulley mounted to the outboard rotor blade section. In operation, the electric motor drives the harmonic gear set which rotates the counter rotating spools. Rotation of the spools causes the cables to be wound onto or off their respective spool consequently effecting retraction/extension of the pulley and the attached outboard rotor blade section relative the inboard rotor blade section. As each <b>blade</b> <b>drive</b> system is independently driven by a separate electrical motor, each independent VDR blade assembly is independently positionable...|$|E
30|$|In a TPGS or WPGS, {{there are}} three subsystems: BTB converter, control system and kinetic energy {{conversion}} device. The failure rate of the BTB converter is calculated by (16). The kinetic energy conversion device (KECD) consists of <b>blades,</b> <b>driven</b> shaft, gearbox, DFIG generator, transformer and other parts. If any of those components fails, the subsystem fails. Thus, the failure rate of the KECD subsystem {{is the sum of}} failure rates of all these components, which can be estimated from historical records. The failure rate of the control subsystem can be also estimated from historical data.|$|R

A bifurcation diagram reveals complex nonlinear behaviors over a range of parameter values. Next, the largest Lyapunov exponent is estimated to identify periodic and chaotic motions. Finally, a method for controlling a chaotic automotive wiper system will be proposed. The method involves applying another external input, called a dither signal, to the system. Some simulation results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally jigsaws are {{manufactured}} using a thin flexible cutting <b>blade</b> <b>driven</b> by a motor {{known as a}} bandsaw. This method of cutting thin wood requires a degree of manual dexterity and patience to avoid spoiling the work. An alternative solution to this labour-intensive method of cutting intricate shapes in wood was required using modern technology solutions.

50|$|Using rotor {{technology}} licensed {{from the}} Cierva Autogiro Company, a single radial engine drove twin rotors, set on tubular steel outriggers {{to the left}} and right of the fuselage. Each main rotor consisted of three articulated and tapered <b>blades,</b> <b>driven</b> by the engine through gears and shafts. Longitudinal and directional control was achieved using cyclic pitch and asymmetric rotor lift.The counter-rotation of the two rotors solved the problem of torque-reaction as also shown by Louis Bréguet. The small horizontal-axis propeller directly driven by the engine was purely to provide the necessary airflow to cool the engine during low speed or hovering flight and provided negligible forward thrust.|$|R
2500|$|Contractor {{table saws}} are heavier, larger {{and have an}} {{attached}} stand or base, often with wheels. The motor either is [...] "direct drive" [...] to the <b>blade</b> (<b>drives</b> the <b>blade</b> directly without a belt) or hinges off {{the rear of the}} saw and <b>drives</b> the <b>blade</b> via one, or occasionally two, belts using a 1 to 2 hp (750 to 1500 W) induction type motor. This is the type often used by hobbyists and homeowners because standard electrical circuits provide adequate power to run it, and due to its low cost. Because the motor sometimes hangs off the rear of the saw on a pivot, dust collection can be problematic in comparison with a cabinet saw.|$|R

50|$|The driven region, {{also called}} the {{propeller}} region, is the region {{at the end of}} the blades. Normally, it consists of about 30 percent of the radius. It is the driven region that produces the most drag. The overall result is a deceleration in the rotation of the blade. The driving region, or autorotative region, normally lies between 25 and 70 percent of the blade radius, which produces the forces needed to turn the blades during autorotation. Total aerodynamic force in the driving region is inclined slightly forward of the axis of rotation, producing a continual acceleration force. This inclination supplies thrust, which tends to accelerate the rotation of the <b>blade.</b> <b>Driving</b> region size varies with blade pitch setting, rate of descent, and rotor rotational speed.|$|R
50|$|Wiley mill {{refers to}} a {{specific}} group of grinding mills manufactured under the name Thomas Scientific.

Well-dried samples are preferred. In the grinding mill, the material is loaded cut into crude pieces or lumps and loaded into a hopper. From the hopper, the material drops by gravity into the path of a set of revolving hard tool steel <b>blades</b> <b>driven</b> by an electric motor. The revolving knives work against stationary knives and the resulting powder is forced through a steel screen. The powdered material then drops into a waiting collection vessel underneath.|$|R

The mechanism has been designed in order to fulfil high reliability with high performance. Reliability has been verified by life testing over 100000 cycles (factor 2 on expected operative cycles). Performance verified by calibration show that the minimum exposure time with a uniformity of 1 / 500 is 10 ms over a large sensitive area (about 30 x 30 mm). The exposure time can vary from 10 ms to 5 s. Scope of this paper is to present the mechanism and to demonstrate that it accomplishes the sciences and interfaces requirements...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{condition}} monitoring systems on wind turbines {{has increased dramatically}} in recent times. However, their use is mostly restricted to vibration based monitoring systems for the gearbox, generator and drive train.

The costs for system failures are derived, as are possible reductions in these costs due to early detection. Various scenarios are simulated including the addition of condition monitoring systems to the <b>drive</b> train and <b>blade</b> and tower monitoring.

40|$|There is a {{constant}} need for the reduction of operational and maintenance costs of Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECSs). The most efficient way of reducing these costs would be to continuously monitor the condition of these systems. This allows for early detection of the degeneration of the generator health, facilitating a proactive response, minimizing downtime, and maximizing productivity. Wind generators are also inaccessible since they are situated on extremely high towers, which are normally 20 Â m or more in height. There are also plans {{to increase the number}} of offshore sites increasing the need for a remote means of WECS monitoring that eliminates some of the difficulties faced due to accessibility problems. Therefore and due to the importance of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in WECS (<b>blades,</b> <b>drive</b> trains, and generators), and keeping in mind the need for future research, this paper is intended as a brief status describing different types of faults, their generated signatures, and their diagnostic schemes.

40|$|In gas turbines, {{the blades}} of axial turbine stages rotate in close {{proximity}} to a stationary peripheral wall. Differential expansion of the turbine wheel, blades, and the shroud causes variations {{in the size of the}} clearance gap between blade tip and stationary shroud. The necessity to tolerate this differential thermal expansion dictates that the clearance gap cannot be eliminated altogether, despite accurate engine machining. Pressure differences between the pressure and suction sides of a <b>blade</b> <b>drives</b> a flow through the clearance gap. This flow, the tip leakage flow, is detrimental to engine performance. The primary detrimental effect of tip leakage flow is the reduction of turbine stage efficiency, and a second is the convective heat transfer associated with the flow. The surface area at the blade tip in contact with the hot working gas represents an additional thermal loading on the blade which, together with heat transfer to the suction and pressure side surface area, must be removed by the blade internal cooling flows. Experimental results concerned with the local heat transfer characteristics on all surfaces of shrouded, rectangular cavities are reported. A brief discussion of the mass transfer system used is given...|$|R
