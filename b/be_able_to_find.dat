5|$|Consisting of six chapters, Madonnaland finds Simone visiting Madonna's birthplace, Bay City, Michigan, {{where she}} spoke with the local people about the singer. The book also {{analyses}} Madonna's career and fame, with the author delving into her own music career and obscure Bay City bands. Simone had been initially commissioned to write a new biography about the singer. However, due to already available excess content on her, the author felt she would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> anything new. Instead, she ended up writing Madonnaland about her own failure to create a Madonna biography, why Bay City {{did not have any}} commemoration for the singer, as well as unknown music bands, pop culture and celebrity life.|$|E

The girl tells him that, when she loses something, she goes to a quiet place for a think, and then can remember where she put it. As the girl leaves, it is revealed that she is Clara Oswald.|$|E

5|$|On October 2, 2008, Nintendo {{presented}} the New Play Control! series of GameCube ports, with Prime and Echoes among the initial Japan titles. In May 2009, Nintendo announced {{that all three}} games would be packaged in a single-disk compilation internationally. Metroid Prime: Trilogy was released in North America on August 24, 2009, packaged in a steel-book case, along with an art booklet. The European release in the following month maintained the booklet, while the Australian release in October only had a metallic cardboard slip cover. On January 8, 2010, {{it was reported that}} Nintendo of America was no longer producing or shipping Metroid Prime: Trilogy, and stated that players may still <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> second-hand copies of Trilogy via video game stores. On January 11, 2010, it was reported that Nintendo Australia had also discontinued the game. Following Nintendo of America's announcement, Nintendo of Europe assured that the game was not discontinued in their region.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{recruits}} The Lone Gunmen to {{help him}} break into a high security research facility where he thinks he may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> more {{information on how to}} save Scully. Meanwhile, Skinner tries to deal directly with The Smoking Man for Scully's life, who tells him he will get back to him. Inside the facility, Mulder discovers that Dr. Scanlon works alongside several clones of Kurt Crawford. The clones show him Scully's harvested ova and tell him they are trying to save the abducted women's lives, since they acted as their birth mothers. They also hope to subvert the colonization project as an inside job. Mulder takes Scully's ova and leaves, being pursued by the Gray-Haired Man as he escapes. He returns to the hospital to see Scully, who tells him that Penny has died but that she intends to fight the disease. Afterward, Mulder phones Skinner for letting him know Scully's doing ok and may return to work soon, as well as for thanking him for his advice about not negotiating with the Smoking Man, after which Skinner and the Smoking Man come to terms on their deal in seclusion.|$|E
5|$|There are few {{morphological}} {{differences that}} distinguish the extinct insular emus {{from the mainland}} emu besides their size, but all three taxa were most often considered distinct species. A 2011 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, which was extracted from five subfossil King Island emu bones, showed that its genetic variation fell within that of the extant mainland emus. It was therefore interpreted as conspecific with the emus of the Australian mainland, and was reclassified as a subspecies of Dromaiusnovaehollandiae, D. n. ater. Other animals present on King Island are also considered as subspecies of their mainland or Tasmanian counterparts rather than distinct species. The authors suggested that further studies using different methods might <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> features that distinguish the taxa. In its 2013 edition, The Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World emended the trinomial name of the King Island emu to D. n. minor, based on Spencer's D. minor, {{on the ground that}} Vieillot's D. ater was originally meant for the mainland emu. This rationale was accepted by the IOC World Bird List, which used D. n. minor thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Gaara first {{appears in}} the series when he is sent to Konohagakure, an allied ninja village, {{to take part in}} the Chunin Exams {{alongside}} his older siblings Kankuro and Temari. In truth, he is sent in order to infiltrate Konohagakure in preparation for an invasion by Sunagakure and its ally, Otogakure. There, he and Kankuro and Temari easily pass both the first and second phases. In the third phase, Gaara is set to fight against Rock Lee. Lee is able to pass Gaara's defenses, provoking an enraged Gaara into breaking Lee's arm and leg, claiming victory. Sasuke Uchiha manages to give Gaara the first injury he has ever received, causing Gaara to suffer a mental breakdown and nearly manifest his Tailed-Beast powers. This begins the invasion, with his older siblings carrying him off as he could not participate in his current state of mind. Both Sasuke and Naruto Uzumaki confront him with the latter defeating him. Later, Sunagakure sends Gaara to help in preventing Sasuke from defecting to Otogakure, which became enemy of Sunagakure once learning that Orochimaru murdered Rasa prior to the attack. While he is able to help Lee fight Orochimaru's servant Kimimaro, Gaara is unable to prevent Sasuke from escaping from Konoha. He makes amends with the many characters he had alienated, apologizing to those he hurt and improving his relationship with his family. At the same time, Gaara's fundamental characteristic becomes the desire to protect as many people as he can, as in doing so he believes, like Naruto, he will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> true strength. This culminates in his replacing his father as the Fifth Kazekage during Part II of the series.|$|E

25|$|Like its predecessor, this {{syndicated}} {{edition of}} Price {{was intended to}} be aired in the Prime Time Access slots on local stations.

This often resulted in shows like Price airing anywhere that they could be fit into a station's programming lineup, such as in the early morning period or in late-night slots. As a consequence, the show would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> its intended audience and the ratings reports would reflect this.|$|E

Additionally, the ship was ordered to stay put in its location, so that despite its camouflage, the returning Israeli sailors would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> it.
