5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E

5|$|Although its {{equations}} {{of motion}} can be linearized, a <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> a nonlinear system. The variable(s) to be solved for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components, i.e. its behavior is not expressible as a sum of the behaviors of its descriptors. Generally, nonlinear systems are difficult to solve and are much less understandable than linear systems. In the idealized case, in which friction and any flexing is ignored, a <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> a conservative system. Damping, however, can still be demonstrated: under the right circumstances, side-to-side oscillations will decrease with time. Energy added with a sideways jolt to a bike running straight and upright (demonstrating self-stability) is converted into increased forward speed, not lost, as the oscillations die out.|$|E
50|$|Likewise, {{mountain}} <b>biking</b> <b>is</b> generally {{prohibited by}} the FLTC. In state parks, mountain <b>biking</b> <b>is</b> allowed only if specifically {{designated by the}} NYS OPRHP. In state forest and reforestation areas, mountain <b>biking</b> <b>is</b> allowed unless the NYS DEC has specifically posted otherwise. Similar disparate rules apply to possession of firearms, both long guns and licensed handguns.|$|R
50|$|Tommaso <b>Bikes</b> <b>is</b> {{a bicycle}} {{manufacturing}} company, headquartered in Denver, Colorado, United States. The <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> designed in Italy, engineered in Colorado, and shipped direct {{to the consumer}} through Giantnerd.com.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, six Royal Enfield <b>bikes</b> <b>were</b> {{inducted}} into the fleet for fighting operations in congested areas. These <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> equipped with fire extinguishers, wireless communication, sirens, and first aid kits.|$|R
5|$|Motions of a bike can {{be roughly}} grouped into those {{out of the}} central plane of symmetry: lateral; {{and those in the}} central plane of symmetry: {{longitudinal}} or vertical. Lateral motions include balancing, leaning, steering, and turning. Motions in the central plane of symmetry include rolling forward, of course, but also stoppies, wheelies, brake diving, and most suspension activation. Motions in these two groups are linearly decoupled, that is they do not interact with each other to the first order. An uncontrolled <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> laterally unstable when stationary and can be laterally self-stable when moving under the right conditions or when controlled by a rider. Conversely, a <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> longitudinally stable when stationary and can be longitudinally unstable when undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} trail a {{particular}} bike has may vary with time for several reasons. On bikes with front suspension, especially telescopic forks, compressing the front suspension, due to heavy braking for example, can steepen the steering axis angle and reduce trail. Trail also varies with lean angle, and steering angle, usually decreasing from a maximum when the <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> straight upright and steered straight ahead. Trail can decrease to zero with sufficiently large lean and steer angles, which can alter how stable a bike feels. Finally, even {{the profile of}} the front tire can influence how trail varies as the <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> leaned and steered.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus has a free bike sharing system, Aarhus Bycykler (Aarhus City Bikes). The {{bicycles}} {{are available}} from 1 April to 30 October at 57 stands throughout the city and {{can be obtained by}} placing a DKK 20 coin in the release slot, like caddies in a supermarket. The coin can be retrieved when the <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> returned. Bicycles can also be hired from many shops.|$|E

25|$|In May 2014, over 40 {{bicycles}} {{were stolen}} from Baltimore Recreation and Parks department's bike-share program. The <b>bikes</b> <b>were</b> stolen during the city's Ride Around Reservoir program in Druid Hill Park. The <b>bikes</b> <b>were</b> set up to be lent out {{when a group of}} youths took them. The cost of replacing the stolen <b>bikes</b> <b>is</b> devastating to the program, which operates completely on donations.|$|R
50|$|The Honda TR200 {{series of}} <b>bikes</b> <b>was</b> {{produced}} only in 1986 and 1987. The engine was a 199 cc four-stroke OHC single {{linked to a}} five-speed transmission and automatic clutch. It featured lever actuated drum brakes on both wheels. This <b>bike</b> <b>was</b> unique in that it used two ATV-type tires. Presently complete <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> quite uncommon, though replacement parts are readily available as they interchange with other Honda ATCs.|$|R
5|$|Citi <b>Bike</b> <b>is</b> {{a privately}} owned public bicycle sharing system serving New York City and Jersey City, New Jersey. Named after lead sponsor Citigroup, it is {{operated}} by Motivate (formerly Alta Bicycle Share), with former Metropolitan Transportation Authority CEO Jay Walder as chief executive. The system's bikes and stations use BIXI-branded technology from PBSC Urban Solutions.|$|E
5|$|Each bike dock has {{a repair}} button; users press this {{to report a}} damaged or {{malfunctioning}} bike and {{take it out of}} service. Riders are expected to notify Capital Bikeshare if a <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> unable to dock at a station and are responsible for the rented bike until it has been returned.|$|E
5|$|Any rider {{may take}} {{unlimited}} trips {{of up to}} 30 minutes, measured from when the <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> withdrawn from a dock to when it is returned. (If a destination station is full, riders can use the kiosk to get 15 more free minutes to return the bike to another location.) Longer trips incur fees for each additional half-hour {{on a scale that}} rises from $1.50 to $8.00. These prices are designed to encourage short trips from place to place instead of longer leisure rides.|$|E
50|$|Parts may be sourced {{from public}} donations. Children's <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> often donated {{when they are}} outgrown, and {{abandoned}} <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> sometimes obtained from police stations, street cleaning firms, or from large institutions such as schools and universities.|$|R
50|$|Abici <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> made {{in eight}} colors based on car {{colors of the}} 1950s, has a Brooks England saddle with copper rivets, metal {{mudguards}} and a chrome brake rod. The light-weight <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> made from aluminum, carbon fiber and titanium.|$|R
5000|$|Roehr {{introduced}} the V-Roehr production motorcycle in March 2007. The <b>bike</b> <b>was</b> {{to be powered}} by a 180 hp supercharged Harley Davidson 1250 cc [...] "Revolution" [...] engine. Production of the first 50 <b>bikes</b> <b>was</b> scheduled to begin in 2008.|$|R
5|$|Between {{these last}} two speeds, if they both exist, is a range of forward speeds at which the {{particular}} bike design is self-stable. In {{the case of the}} bike whose eigenvalues are shown here, the self-stable range is 5.3–8.0m/s (1218mph). The fourth eigenvalue, which is usually stable (very negative), represents the castoring behavior of the front wheel, as it tends to turn towards the direction in which the <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> traveling. Note that this idealized model does not exhibit the wobble or shimmy and rear wobble instabilities described above. They are seen in models that incorporate tire interaction with the ground or other degrees of freedom.|$|E
5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|Fourth, camber thrust {{contributes}} to the centripetal force necessary to cause the bike to deviate from a straight path, along with cornering force due to the slip angle, and can be the largest contributor. Camber thrust {{contributes to}} the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that of the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.|$|E

5|$|If the {{steering}} of a <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> locked, it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E
5|$|It {{can also}} be seen however that this simple 2-dimensional model, {{essentially}} an inverted pendulum on a turntable, predicts that the steady-state turn is unstable. If the <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> displaced slightly downwards from its equilibrium lean angle, the torque of gravity increases, that of centrifugal force decreases and the displacement gets amplified. A more-sophisticated model that allows a wheel to steer, adjust the path, and counter the torque of gravity, is necessary to capture the self-stability observed in real bikes.|$|E
5|$|The rider applies {{torque to}} the {{handlebars}} {{in order to}} turn the front wheel and so to control lean and maintain balance. At high speeds, small steering angles quickly move the ground contact points laterally; at low speeds, larger steering angles are required {{to achieve the same}} results in the same amount of time. Because of this, it is usually easier to maintain balance at high speeds. As self-stability typically occurs at speeds above a certain threshold, going faster increases the chances that a <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> contributing to its own stability.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to calculate eigenvalues, {{one for each of}} the four state variables (lean angle, lean rate, steer angle, and steer rate), from the linearized equations in order to analyze the normal modes and self-stability of a particular bike design. In the plot to the right, eigenvalues of one particular bicycle are calculated for forward speeds of 0–10m/s (22mph). When the real parts of all eigenvalues (shown in dark blue) are negative, the <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> self-stable. When the imaginary parts of any eigenvalues (shown in cyan) are non-zero, the bike exhibits oscillation. The eigenvalues are point symmetric about the origin and so any bike design with a self-stable region in forward speeds will not be self-stable going backwards at the same speed.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} {{vibrations}} in bikes includes its causes, such as engine balance, wheel balance, ground surface, and aerodynamics; its transmission and absorption; {{and its effects}} on the bike, the rider, and safety. An important factor in any vibration analysis is a comparison of the natural frequencies of the system with the possible driving frequencies of the vibration sources. A close match means mechanical resonance that can result in large amplitudes. A challenge in vibration damping is to create compliance in certain directions (vertically) without sacrificing frame rigidity needed for power transmission and handling (torsionally). Another issue with vibration for the <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> the possibility of failure due to material fatigue Effects of vibration on riders include discomfort, loss of efficiency, Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome, a secondary form Raynaud's disease, and whole body vibration. Vibrating instruments may be inaccurate or difficult to read.|$|E
5|$|A <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is more easily balanced in the hand than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to fall over) will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike which is just as tall but with a lower center of mass. This is {{an example of}} a vertical second-class lever. A small force at the end of the lever, the seat or handlebars at the top of the bike, more easily moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where the tires touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|E
