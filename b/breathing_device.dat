500|$|In some occasions, {{the oxygen}} levels are {{persistently}} too low (oxygen saturations below 90%). In that case, the hypoventilation itself may {{be improved by}} switching from CPAP treatment to an alternate device that delivers [...] "bi-level" [...] positive pressure: higher pressure during inspiration (breathing in) and a lower pressure during expiration (breathing out). If this too is ineffective in increasing oxygen levels, the addition of oxygen therapy may be necessary. As a last resort, tracheostomy may be necessary; this involves making a surgical opening in the trachea to bypass obesity-related airway obstruction in the neck. This may be combined with mechanical ventilation with an assisted <b>breathing</b> <b>device</b> through the opening.|$|E
2500|$|Le Prieur's {{design was}} the first {{autonomous}} <b>breathing</b> <b>device</b> used by the first scuba diving clubs in history - Racleurs de fond founded by Glenn Orr in California in 1933, and Club des sous-l'eau founded by Le Prieur himself in Paris in 1935. Fernez had previously invented the noseclip, a mouthpiece (equipped with a one-way valve for exhalation) and diving goggles, and Yves le Prieur just joined to those three Fernez elements a hand-controlled regulator and a compressed-air cylinder. Fernez's goggles didn't allow a dive deeper than ten metres due to [...] "mask squeeze", so, in 1933, Le Prieur replaced all the Fernez equipment (goggles, noseclip and valve) by a full face mask, directly supplied with constant flow air from the cylinder.|$|E

Lifestyle changes may include avoiding alcohol, losing weight, stopping smoking, and sleeping on one's side. <b>Breathing</b> <b>devices</b> {{include the use}} of a CPAP machine.

500|$|Freediving precludes {{the use of}} {{external}} <b>breathing</b> <b>devices,</b> and relies {{on the ability of}} divers to hold their breath until resurfacing.

5000|$|The Royal Navy used {{a similar}} device, the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus, {{but it was}} clumsy to use. The Royal Navy later adopted the {{practice}} of blow and go, in which the sailor would exhale continuously during ascent to avoid air expanding in the lungs, which could cause them to rupture. Postwar, submariner Walter F. Schlech, Jr., among others, examined submerged escape without <b>breathing</b> <b>devices</b> and discovered ascent was possible from as deep as 300 ft: [...] "in one sense, the Momsen Lung concept may have killed far more submariners than it rescued".|$|R
50|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD), {{also known as}} chronic obstructive airways disease (COAD) or chronic airflow limitation (CAL), {{is a group of}} illnesses characterised by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The flow of air {{into and out of the}} lungs is impaired. This can be measured with <b>breathing</b> <b>devices</b> such as a peak flow meter or by spirometry. The term COPD includes the conditions emphysema and chronic bronchitis although most patients with COPD have characteristics of both conditions to varying degrees. Asthma being a reversible obstruction of airways is often considered separately, but many COPD patients also have some degree of reversibility in their airways.|$|R
50|$|Cosmonauts Gorbatko and Glazkov {{were the}} back-up crew for Soyuz 23, which failed to dock with Salyut 5 several months earlier. Soyuz 24 was {{launched}} 7 February 1977, and successfully docked with the orbiting space station the next day. However, the crew {{did not immediately}} enter the station, atypically having a sleep period first and delaying their entry by some 11 hours. Observers speculate that problems with fumes which may have caused the Soyuz 21 crew to leave were resolved or dealt with by the new crew.

25|$|Early in the 20th century polio {{would become}} the world's most feared disease. The disease hit without warning, tended to strike white, {{affluent}} individuals, required long quarantine periods during which parents were separated from children: {{it was impossible to}} tell who would get the disease and who would be spared. The consequences of the disease left polio victims marked for life, leaving behind vivid images of wheelchairs, crutches, leg braces, <b>breathing</b> <b>devices,</b> and deformed limbs. However, polio changed not only the lives of those who survived it, but also affected profound cultural changes: the emergence of grassroots fund-raising campaigns that would revolutionize medical philanthropy, the rise of rehabilitation therapy and, through campaigns for the social and civil rights of the disabled, polio survivors helped to spur the modern disability rights movement.|$|R

The last were related to surgery complications. All of them needed medical attention, being {{the majority of them}} discharged to ordinary ward hospitalization. There were not relevant differences as far as the urgency of the hospitalization, the clinical profile and the assistance needed in the moment of the AE. In 30  % of the AE, the equipment and available resources were pointed out as contributing factors; in 35  % of cases it was related to formation and training; in 40  % of cases it was due to elements related to the patient and in 45  % of the cases it was elements related to the performance. The most frequent serious safety issues were surgery complications or damages related to invasive procedures, three of them related to the handling of <b>breathing</b> <b>devices</b> and two of them with reaction after blood transfusions.

A principal element of hypoxia-awareness training is the intentional evocation of hypoxia symptoms during specific training sessions within a safe and controlled environment. Repetitive training should enable pilots to learn and recognize their personal hypoxia symptoms. A time span of 3 – 6 years is generally considered suitable to refresh knowledge of the more subtle and early symptoms especially. Currently, {{there are two different}} technical approaches available to induce hypoxia during training: hypobaric chamber training and reduced-oxygen <b>breathing</b> <b>devices.</b> Hypoxia training for aircrew is extremely important and effective, and the hypoxia symptoms should be emphasized clearly to aircrews. The use of tight-fitting masks, leak checks, and equipment checks should be taught to all aircrew and reinforced regularly. It is noteworthy that there are major differences in the required quality and quantity of hypoxia training for both military and civilian pilots.
