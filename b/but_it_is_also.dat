5|$|According to Pausanias {{he was the}} son of Diotimus. Ancient {{commentators}} mention {{an association}} between Milo and the philosopher Pythagoras, who lived at or near Croton for many years. Commentators may have confused the philosopher with an athletic trainer, Pythagoras of Samos, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> possible the trainer and the philosopher were the same person.|$|E
5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His {{frequent}} use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are peculiar to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> possible that he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.|$|E

5|$|The monarchy {{was also}} dynastic: the princes {{were to be}} elected by boyars from {{among the members of}} the ruling family, the Basarabs. The boyars were the members of the privileged landed aristocracy. However, the origin of the Romanian boyar class is problematic: it may have evolved {{naturally}} from the heads of the Vlach villages and communities, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> possible that the princes created it by granting privileges to certain favored persons.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{disappearance}} of the Rodrigues rail may {{have been caused by}} introduced cats, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> possible that deforestation by tortoise hunters may have contributed significantly; from 1735, these hunters burned off forests so they could collect giant Cylindraspis tortoises for their meat and oil. The French astronomer Alexandre Guy Pingré, who visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, wrote in 1763 that the bird was extinct by the time of his visit.|$|E

5|$|A Markov {{chain is}} a type of Markov process that has either {{discrete}} state space or discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies. For example, it is common to define a Markov chain as a Markov process in either discrete or continuous time with a countable state space (thus regardless of the nature of time), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> common to define a Markov chain as having discrete time in either countable or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space).|$|E
5|$|A {{theodolite}} can {{be considerably}} more accurate if used correctly, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> considerably {{more difficult to}} use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be calibrated using astronomical observation, usually {{the position of the}} Sun. Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a clinometer.|$|E

It is true that Michael Jordan was the person who in the end actually did the deeds, went on the court and hit the final jump shot again and again, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> true that David Falk helped revolutionize the process of representing a basketball player, going into a team sport and creating the idea of the individual player as a commercial superstar.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is a {{freshwater}} {{species and}} {{is found in}} forested riverine habitats and areas of flooded forest around lakes. It seems to prefer rivers and streams with fast-flowing water, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> found in quiet, nutrient-poor waters in Venezuela and southeastern Brazil. It is able to travel quite large distances overland at night and sub-adult individuals have sometimes been found in isolated, temporary pools. In {{the northern and southern}} parts of its range, it is also found in gallery forests in savannah country, but it is absent from such habitats in Los Llanos and the Pantanal. Cuvier's dwarf caiman seems relatively tolerant of cool water compared to other species of alligator. During the day, individuals sometimes lie up in burrows but at other times rest on piles of rocks or sun themselves while lying, facing the sun, in shallow water with their backs exposed.|$|E
5|$|Dietary nickel {{may affect}} human health through infections by nickel-dependent bacteria, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> {{possible}} that nickel {{is an essential}} nutrient for bacteria residing in the large intestine, in effect functioning as a prebiotic. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that nickel is an essential nutrient for humans, so neither a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) nor an Adequate Intake have been established. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level of dietary nickel is 1000µg/day as soluble nickel salts. Dietary intake is estimated at 70 to 100 µg/day, with less than 10% absorbed. What is absorbed is excreted in urine. Relatively large amounts of nickel – comparable to the estimated average ingestion above – leach into food cooked in stainless steel. For example, the amount of nickel leached after 10 cooking cycles into one serving of tomato sauce averages 88µg.|$|E

5|$|From 1840 onwards {{he became}} a leading chess commentator, and won matches against top players of the 1840s. In 1847 he entered a {{parallel}} career as a Shakespearean scholar. Ill health and his two writing careers led him to give up competitive chess after 1851. In 1858 {{attempts were made to}} organise a match between Staunton and Paul Morphy, but they failed. It is often alleged that Staunton deliberately misled Morphy while trying to avoid the match, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> possible Staunton overestimated his chances of getting physically fit and of making time available for a match.|$|E
5|$|Her uncle Ásmundr {{probably}} {{died in the}} Battle of Fýrisvellir, in the 980s, and it {{was probably}} {{at the side of}} king Eric the Victorious. Özurr had entered into the service of a more powerful liege and died for the Byzantine Emperor. Halfdan may have died either on Bornholm or in a holmgang, whereas where Kári died remains uncertain. The most likely interpretation may be that he died on Od, the old name for the north-western cape of Zealand, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> possible that it was at Dundee in Scotland. Búi's location of death is not given, but Larsson (2002) comments that it was probably {{in a way that was}} not considered as glorious as those of his brothers.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011, Cielo tested {{positive}} for the banned substance furosemide. Furosemide is a diuretic often used to help lose weight <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> a masking agent which may hide the presence of other drugs. Cielo was one of four Brazilian swimmers who {{tested positive}} for the substance and was given a warning by Brazil's national swimming federation. Cielo claimed the positive drug test was a result of a cross-contamination. FINA appealed Cielo's case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and CAS upheld the warning for Cielo. CAS claimed that a caffeine supplement had been contaminated, causing the failed drug test. CAS was convinced that the furosemide found was not aimed at improving athletic performance or masking the use of some other performance-enhancing substance.|$|E
