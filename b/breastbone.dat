5|$|Plural: sterna. The <b>breastbone</b> of a bird. There are two types: i) carinate sterna—appearing in {{flighted}} birds, {{in which}} the ventral surface is keel-shaped, which provides ample surface area for attachment of wing muscles used for flight; and ii) ratite sterna—appearing in flightless birds, such as rhea, {{in which the}} ventral surface is flattened.|$|E
5|$|The {{anatomy of}} pterosaurs was highly {{modified}} from their reptilian ancestors by the adaption to flight. Pterosaur bones were hollow and air-filled, like {{the bones of}} birds. They had a keeled <b>breastbone</b> that was developed for the attachment of flight muscles and an enlarged brain that shows specialised features associated with flight. In some later pterosaurs, the backbone over the shoulders fused into a structure known as a notarium, which served to stiffen the torso during flight, and provide a stable support for the scapula (shoulder blade).|$|E
5|$|On August 1, 1844, Wickliffe {{and two of}} {{his daughters}} boarded the {{steamship}} Georgia traveling from Old Point Comfort in Virginia to Baltimore, Maryland. While en route, he was stabbed in the chest by a man wielding a claspknife. The knife bounced off Wickliffe's <b>breastbone</b> without damaging any major internal organs, and a U.S. Navy officer prevented a second blow from hitting Wickliffe. Wickliffe's attacker, J. McLean Gardner, was disarmed and arrested. Later that night, he wrote Wickliffe a letter of apology. Wickliffe was not seriously injured, and returned home three days after the attack. Gardner was tried and found to be insane; he was later sent to an asylum.|$|E
50|$|In 1810, his {{skeleton}} {{was added}} to the Museum Anatomicum in Marburg. His skeleton is not complete: one arm is missing, his shoulder blades are not connected, his <b>breastbones</b> are missing, and his feet are made of cork.|$|R
50|$|Pengornithids were {{primitive}} enantiornithes. They {{had many}} small teeth in their jaws, and stout legs. Their internal anatomy {{was characterized by}} a hooked outgrowth of the shoulder blade and a pygostyle (the tail bone to which long feathers attach) which was short and rounded, instead of long and blade-shaped as in other enantiornithes. While most enantiornithes had four long backward projections growing from their <b>breastbones,</b> pengornithids only had two.|$|R
500|$|The later {{included}} the superficially gull-like Ichthyornis, the Hesperornithiformes, which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that {{they lost the}} ability to fly and became primarily aquatic. The early euornithes also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds, like strongly keeled <b>breastbones,</b> toothless, beaked portions of their jaws (though most non-avian euornithes retained teeth {{in other parts of the}} jaws). Euornithes also {{included the}} first avialans to develop true pygostyle and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers, which may have replaced the [...] "hind wing" [...] as the primary mode of aerial maneuverability and braking in flight.|$|R
5|$|On September 6, 1901, Leon Czolgosz, an {{unemployed}} factory worker and registered Republican {{with a history}} of mental illness, shot US President William McKinley twice during a public speaking event in Buffalo, New York. McKinley was hit in the <b>breastbone</b> and stomach, and died eight days later. Czolgosz was arrested, and interrogated around the clock. During interrogation he claimed to be an Anarchist and said he had been inspired to act after attending a speech held by Goldman. The authorities used this as a pretext to charge Goldman with planning McKinley's assassination. They tracked her to a residence in Chicago she shared with Havel, as well as Mary and Abe Isaak, an anarchist couple. Goldman was arrested, along with Isaak, Havel, and ten other anarchists.|$|E
5|$|Thamnophilidae {{was removed}} from Formicariidae, leaving behind the antthrushes and antpittas, due to {{recognition}} of differences {{in the structure of}} the <b>breastbone</b> (sternum) and syrinx, and Sibley and Ahlquist's examination of DNA–DNA hybridization. The Thamnophilidae antbirds are members of the infraorder Tyrannides (or tracheophone suboscines), one of two infraorders in the suborder Tyranni. The Thamnophilidae are now thought to occupy a fairly basal position within the infraorder, i. e. with regard to their relatives the antthrushes and antpittas, tapaculos, gnateaters, and also the ovenbirds. The sister group of the Thamnophilidae is thought to be the gnateaters. The ovenbirds, tapaculos, antthrushes and antpittas are thought to represent a different radiation of that early split.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the wings}} of modern birds, the flight {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but {{it is unclear whether}} Archaeopteryx was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony <b>breastbone</b> suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike coracoids, or perhaps, to a cartilaginous sternum. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between scapula, coracoid, and humerus—instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds—may indicate that Archaeopteryx was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by Philip Senter in 2006, Archaeopteryx was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.|$|E
5000|$|Fussell {{undertook}} {{the large}} task of illustrating William Yarrell's 1843 History of British Birds. Yarrell states that Fussell drew [...] "nearly five hundred" [...] of the 520 engravings mentioned on the book's title page. The work began in 1837 and continued for six years, Yarrell publishing {{at the rate}} of one instalment, containing three sheets, every two months. Many of the drawings were from skins or stuffed specimens, though every bird species is illustrated with a lifelike drawing of the bird standing (or rarely, flying or swimming) in a natural setting. Additional drawings depict nests, feathers, and details of bird anatomy including feet, <b>breastbones,</b> and windpipes. The work was hugely influential.|$|R

5000|$|Known enantiornithean fossils include eggs, embryos, and hatchlings. An enantiornithean embryo, still {{curled in}} its egg, has been {{reported}} from the Yixian Formation. Juvenile specimens can be identified {{by a combination of}} factors: rough texture of their bone tips indicating portions which were still made of cartilage at the time of death, relatively small <b>breastbones,</b> large skulls and eyes, and bones which had not yet fused to one another. Some hatchling specimens have been given formal names, including [...] "Liaoxiornis delicatus"; however, Luis Chiappe and colleagues considered the practice of naming new species based on juveniles detrimental to the study of enantiornitheans, because it is nearly impossible to determine which adult species a given juvenile specimen belongs to, making any species with a hatchling holotype a nomen dubium.|$|R

25|$|Minimaze {{procedures}} are minimally invasive {{versions of the}} original Cox maze procedure but without cardiac incisions. These procedures do not require a median sternotomy (vertical incision in the <b>breastbone)</b> or cardiopulmonary bypass (heart-lung machine). They use laser, cryothermy, radiofrequency, or acoustic energy to ablate atrial tissue near the pulmonary veins and make other required ablations to mimic the maze.|$|E

500|$|Alexander Fussell created {{most of the}} {{drawings}} for the book. Yarrell thanks Fussell in his Preface for [...] "nearly five hundred of {{the drawings}} on wood here employed", and John Thompson (1785–1866) and his sons for the [...] "very long series of engravings" [...] of the drawings. He also thanks his printers, Messrs. Bentley, Wilson and Fley for their care and skill. The pen for the remaining drawings, if any (the title page asserts there are 520 in the book), is not stated. As well as the figures of birds, there are 59 tail-pieces (following Bewick, small woodcuts {{to fill in the}} spaces at ends of articles), of which some are whimsical, like Bewick's, but many illustrate anatomical details, especially <b>breastbones</b> and windpipes, and others, although decorative, realistically depict aspects of bird behaviour or human interaction with birds. For example, the tail-piece for the [...] "Jack Snipe" [...] shows a bittern among reeds, swallowing a frog, while that for the [...] "Common Bittern" [...] shows [...] "a mode of shooting an Eagle from a pit".|$|R
25|$|The term “flat bone” is {{something}} of a misnomer because, although a flat bone is typically thin, it is also often curved. Examples include the cranial (skull) bones, the scapulae (shoulder blades), the sternum (<b>breastbone),</b> and the ribs. Flat bones serve as points of attachment for muscles and often protect internal organs. Flat bones do not have a medullary cavity because they are thin.|$|E
25|$|A {{somewhat}} rare congenital {{disorder of}} the sternum {{sometimes referred to}} as an anatomical variation is a sternal foramen, a single round hole in the sternum that is present from birth and usually is off-centered to the right or left, commonly forming in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th segments of the <b>breastbone</b> body. Congenital sternal foramens can often be mistaken for bullet holes. They are usually without symptoms but can be problematic if acupuncture in the area is intended.|$|E
25|$|The chest (thoracic cavity) {{progressively}} slopes outwards {{from the}} thoracic inlet (atop the <b>breastbone)</b> and above {{to the lowest}} ribs that support the breasts. The inframammary fold, where the lower portion of the breast meets the chest, is an anatomic feature created by the adherence of the breast skin and the underlying connective tissues of the chest; the IMF is the lower-most extent of the anatomic breast. Normal breast tissue typically has a texture that feels nodular or granular, to an extent that varies considerably from woman to woman.|$|E

25|$|The poodle is an active, {{intelligent}} and elegant dog, squarely built, and well proportioned. To ensure the desirable squarely built appearance, {{the length of}} body measured from the <b>breastbone</b> {{to the point of}} the rump approximates the height from the highest point of the shoulders to the ground. The eyes should be very dark, oval in shape, and have an alert and intelligent expression. The ears should fold over close to the head, set at, or slightly below, eye level. The coat should be of naturally curly texture, dense throughout, although most AKC-registered show dogs have a lion-cut or other, similarly shaven look. The sizes of the official AKC-recognized Poodle breeds are determined by height, not by weight.|$|E
25|$|In a single-lung {{transplant}} {{the process}} starts {{out after the}} donor lung has been inspected and the decision to accept the donor lung for the patient has been made. An incision is generally made from under the shoulder blade around the chest, ending near the sternum. An alternate method involves an incision under the <b>breastbone.</b> In {{the case of a}} singular lung transplant the lung is collapsed, the blood vessels in the lung tied off, and the lung removed at the bronchial tube. The donor lung is placed, the blood vessels reattached, and the lung reinflated. To make sure the lung is satisfactory and to clear any remaining blood and mucus in the new lung a bronchoscopy will be performed. When the surgeons are satisfied with the performance of the lung the chest incision will be closed.|$|E
25|$|In women, {{the breasts}} overlay the pectoralis major muscles and usually extend from {{the level of}} the second rib to {{the level of the}} sixth rib in the front of the human rib cage; thus, the breasts cover much of the chest area and the chest walls. At the front of the chest, the breast tissue can extend from the {{clavicle}} (collarbone) to the middle of the sternum (<b>breastbone).</b> At the sides of the chest, the breast tissue can extend into the axilla (armpit), and can reach as far to the back as the latissimus dorsi muscle, extending from the lower back to the humerus bone (the longest bone of the upper arm). As a mammary gland, the breast is composed of differing layers of tissue, predominantly two types: adipose tissue; and glandular tissue, which affects the lactation functions of the breasts.|$|E
25|$|By {{the spring}} of 1862, Kane had {{partially}} recovered from his wound {{and returned to the}} Bucktails. They served as part of Brig. Gen. George Dashiell Bayard's cavalry in the Shenandoah Valley, fighting against Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign. At Harrisonburg, he and 104 picked riflemen were sent to the rescue of a regiment that had fallen into an ambush. Kane encountered three Confederate regiments on June 6, 1862. He was struck by a bullet that split the bone below his right knee and his men left him on the field. When he tried to rise after the fighting was over, a Confederate soldier broke his <b>breastbone</b> with a blow from the butt of his rifle and Kane, unconscious, was captured. He was exchanged, for Williams C. Wickham, in mid-August. He returned to duty in time for the Northern Virginia Campaign, but was so weakened that another officer led his regiment. He had to be helped onto his horse and was forced to walk using crutches; his Harrisonburg wound would reopen repeatedly for the next two years.|$|E
25|$|Fossils of Confuciusornis {{show that}} it had an {{exceptionally}} large humerus (upper arm bone). Near its shoulder-end this was equipped with a prominent deltopectoral crest. Characteristically this crista deltopectoralis was with Confuciusornis pierced by an oval hole which may have reduced the bone's weight or enlarged the attachment area of the flight miscles. The furcula or wishbone, like that of Archaeopteryx, was a simple curved bar lacking a pointed process at the back, a hypocleidum. The sternum (<b>breastbone)</b> was relatively broad and had a low keel which was raised at the back end. This bony keel {{may or may not}} have anchored a larger, cartilaginous, keel for enlarged pectoral muscles. The scapulae (shoulder blades) were fused to the strut-like coracoid bones and may have formed a solid base for the attachment of wing muscles. The orientation of the shoulder joint was sideways, instead of angled upward as in modern birds; this means that Confuciusornis was unable to lift its wings high above its back. According to a study by Phil Senter in 2006, the joint was even pointed largely downwards meaning that the humerus could not be lifted above the horizontal. This would make Confuciusornis incapable of the upstroke required for flapping flight; the same would have been true for Archaeopteryx.|$|E
25|$|Anchiornis {{is notable}} for its {{proportionally}} long forelimbs, which measured 80% {{of the total}} length of the hindlimbs. This {{is similar to the}} condition in early avians such as Archaeopteryx, and the authors pointed out that long forelimbs are necessary for flight. Anchiornis also had a more avian wrist than other non-avialan theropods. The authors initially speculated {{that it would have been}} possible for Anchiornis to fly or glide. However, further finds showed that the wings of Anchiornis, while well-developed, were short when compared to later species like Microraptor, with relatively short primary feathers that had rounded, symmetrical tips, unlike the pointed, aerodynamically proportioned feathers of Microraptor. A 2016 study of potential flight performance in early paravians concluded that while juvenile Anchiornis specimens may have been able to use their wings to assist running up an incline, and could possibly have achieved flapping flight if a very high angle flapping wing stroke was used, the larger adult specimens would not have gained any aerodynamic benefit from their wings - they were simply too heavy compared to their total wing area. The same study found that flapping the wings while running would have resulted in a small (10%) increase to its running speed. Similarly, use of the wings during leaping would have resulted in a 15-20% increase in height and distance. Notably, Anchiornis seems to have lacked a <b>breastbone</b> (sternum), which may have been made of cartilage rather than bone, as in more primitive theropods.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, R. G. Harrison, a {{professor}} of anatomy, used a portable x-ray machine {{to get a better}} look at the internal structures of the mummy to better determine age and cause of death of Tutankhamun. One of the most abnormal findings was the sternum (<b>breastbone)</b> and most parts of the frontal ribs were missing. Removing these bones was not part of the normal mummification process, which led Harrison to believe they might have been removed because they were badly damaged before his death. Harrison quickly discovered that Carter was not as careful as many of his personal notes had claimed. The mummy was not re-wrapped after 1926, which led to more deterioration due to the extremely hot external elements over the forty-two years. Also many of the limbs had been amputated in the body in order to remove some of the jewellery. Both hands were cut off, both legs were removed from the pelvis, and the head was severed from the body in order to get the mask off. Even more remarkable is the king's right ear and penis were missing, but photographs from Carter show they were both present during his examination. Harrison believed the slight curve in the spine and small bone fragments might have been the result of the embalming process. The lesion on the left jaw showed signs of healing occurred before his death and one of his legs had been broken, but it could not be determined if it happened naturally or as a result of the embalming or Carter's examination. The fact that skull fragments were discovered led many to assume the king was murdered by a blow to the head, but the x-ray could not support or discredit this theory.|$|E
500|$|Zeisler and Becker first {{described}} a syndrome with multiple lentigines, hypertelorism, pectus carinatum (protruding <b>breastbone)</b> and prognathism (protrusion of lower jaw) in 1936. [...] Sporadic descriptions were added through the years. In 1962, cardiac abnormalities and short stature were first {{associated with the}} condition.

[...] However, this classification has fallen into disuse as evolutionary studies have shown that many flightless birds have evolved from flighted birds.|$|E
500|$|The kakapo is a large, rotund parrot; {{the adult}} can measure from [...] in length, and weight {{can vary from}} [...] at maturity. Males are larger than females.

In the same studies, 28 females were found to average [...] and 18 females were found to average respectively. Kakapos are the {{heaviest}} living species of parrot and on average weigh about [...] more than the largest flying parrot, the hyacinth macaw. The kakapo cannot fly, having relatively short wings for its size and lacking the keel on the sternum (<b>breastbone),</b> where the flight muscles of other birds attach. It uses its wings for balance and to break its fall when leaping from trees. Unlike many other land birds, the kakapo can accumulate large amounts of body fat.|$|E
500|$|He concludes {{this final}} section by {{fleshing}} out his Proavis and summarizing {{his view of}} bird origins, in which birds would have departed from reptiles at the pseudosuchians. From this branching point, birds and dinosaurs would have evolved along parallel evolutionary tracks for millions of years, as cousins rather than ancestors. He imagines that these reptiles would have gradually assumed a bipedal gait, and transformed eventually from terrestrial runners to arboreal climbers, developing leaping capabilities ever increasing in length. Along the way, the ancestral reptilian scales would have become [...] "frayed" [...] and gradually developed into feathers, beginning along the forearm and tail and gradually spreading to the entire body. The need for this animal to be an adept climber would have catalyzed the lengthening of its phalanges, which would eventually become long and strong enough to support a wing. Powerful muscles would have developed to anchor these limbs, which would have reacted upon the <b>breastbone.</b> All of this together would have facilitated the origin of an accelerated metabolic rate, resulting in the warm-blooded state known of modern birds. This development would have occurred alongside of the enlargement of the brain, needed to coordinate and supervise these refined features. It is in this way, Heilmann concludes, the reptile has been changed into a bird.|$|E
500|$|The first ceratopsian remains {{known to}} science were {{discovered}} during the U.S. Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories {{led by the}} American geologist F.V. Hayden. Teeth discovered during an 1855 expedition to Montana were first assigned to hadrosaurids and included within the genus Trachodon. It {{was not until the}} early 20th century that some of these were recognized as ceratopsian teeth. During another of Hayden's expeditions in 1872, Fielding Bradford Meek found several giant bones protruding from a hillside in southwestern Wyoming. He alerted paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, who led a dig to recover the partial skeleton. Cope recognized the remains as a dinosaur, but noted that even though the fossil lacked a skull, it was different from any type of dinosaur then known. He named the new species Agathaumas sylvestris, meaning [...] "marvellous forest-dweller". Soon after, Cope named two more dinosaurs that would eventually come to be recognized as ceratopsids: Polyonax and Monoclonius. Monoclonius was notable for the number of disassociated remains found, including the first evidence of ceratopsid horns and frills. Several Monoclonius fossils were found by Cope, assisted by Charles Hazelius Sternberg, in the summer of 1876 near the Judith River in Chouteau County, Montana. Since the ceratopsians had not been recognised yet as a distinctive group, Cope was uncertain about much of the fossil material, not recognizing the nasal horn core, nor the brow horns, as part of a fossil horn. The frill bone was interpreted {{as a part of the}} <b>breastbone.</b>|$|E
