5|$|A {{traditional}} {{game called}} kitsune-ken (fox-fist) references the kitsune's powers over human beings. The game {{is similar to}} rock, paper, scissors, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> hand positions signify a fox, a hunter, and a village headman. The headman beats the hunter, whom he outranks; the hunter beats the fox, whom he shoots; the fox beats the headman, whom he bewitches.|$|E
5|$|However, Wason had {{expected}} the Methven Branch railway {{to be built}} near Barrhill, {{but when it was}} built on a more southerly route along Thompsons Track and what was later to become known as Lauriston, the village began to decline. Dwindling population forced the closure of the school in 1938, although the Church of St John the Evangelist is still in use. Most of the buildings were constructed from pine wood grown on the estate, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> original concrete buildings remain: church, school and schoolhouse.|$|E

The ships saw very little service during World War I in the V Division of the Austro-Hungarian fleet. Budapest and Wien took part in the bombardment of Italian positions along the Adriatic coast in 1915 and 1917, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> battleships went largely inactive for the remainder of war.|$|E

The Order of St Patrick, which pertains to Ireland, is the most junior of these three in precedence and age.

The Scottish equivalent is The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, dating in its modern form to 1687.|$|E

5|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>Three</b> Leagues {{had already}} called upon the Swiss {{for help and}} troops from Uri had already arrived in Chur. Upon {{learning}} about the truce, they withdrew, but met a small troop of Habsburg soldiers {{on their way back}} home. When those engaged in the usual insults on the Swiss, the latter crossed the Rhine and killed the scoffers. In retaliation, Habsburg troops sacked the village of Maienfeld on February 7 and called the Swabian League for help. Only five days later, Swiss troops from several cantons had been assembled and reconquered the village and moved towards Lake Constance, pillaging and plundering along the way. On February 20, they again met a Habsburg army, which they defeated in the battle of Hard on the shores of Lake Constance near the estuary of the Rhine, and at about the same time, other Swiss troops invaded the Hegau region between Schaffhausen and Constance. On both sites, the Swiss retreated after a few days.|$|E

5|$|Habsburg was {{launched}} on 9 September 1900, Árpád {{just over a}} year later on 11 September 1901, and Babenberg on 4 October 1902. The ships saw limited service during World War I in the IV Division of the Austro-Hungarian fleet. Babenberg and Árpád bombarded the Italian port of Ancona in 1915, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> battleships were largely inactive for the remainder of their service. They were decommissioned in 1916 to free up the majority of their crews for service in the submarine and air forces. All three ships were ultimately ceded to Great Britain following the end of the war; they were sold to Italian ship-breakers and scrapped in 1921.|$|E
5|$|In Tekken 7, Lars {{returns as}} a playable character. In the game's story mode, {{he finds the}} missing Jin in the Middle East and rescues him. He then reunites with a {{restored}} Alisa and Lee, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> are attacked by the Tekken Forces, who in turn are attacked by Lars' forces {{in an attempt to}} stop them from targeting Jin. He saves Jin's life again, this time from a journalist who intended to avenge his family, who had been killed by Jin. After seeing his half-brother, Kazuya Mishima, killing Heihachi, Lars reveals that the reason for him saving Jin was that he wants him to kill Kazuya and restore world peace, to which Jin agrees.|$|E
5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of 1922, Forbes had met Elias Mortimer, agent for the Thompson-Black Construction Company of St. Louis, which wanted to construct the hospitals. The two men became close, and Mortimer paid for Forbes' travels through the West, looking at potential hospital sites for the wounded World War I veterans. Forbes was also friendly with Charles F. Hurley, owner of the Hurley-Mason Construction Company of Washington state. Harding had ordered that all contracts be pursuant to public notice, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> worked out a deal whereby the two companies would get the contracts with the profits divided three ways. Some of the money went to the bureau's chief counsel, Charles F. Cramer. Forbes defrauded the government in this hospital construction, increasing construction costs from $3,000 to $4,000 per bed. A tenth of the inflated construction billings was {{set aside for the}} conspirators, with Forbes receiving a third of the take. The graft then spread to land acquisition, with Forbes authorizing the purchase of a San Francisco tract – that was worth less than $20,000 – for $105,000. At least $25,000 of the resulting financial excess was divided between Forbes and Cramer.|$|E

5|$|The game {{takes place}} eight years {{following}} the conclusion of Banjo-Tooie, in which Gruntilda's body was destroyed by Banjo and Kazooie. In the time since, the two have become lazy and out of shape from their lack of adventuring. Gruntilda's detached head returns to their home of Spiral Mountain for revenge, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> are interrupted by the sudden appearance of the Lord of Games (L.O.G.), the creator of all video games.

He uses his powers to give Gruntilda an artificial body and to restore the duo's physical fitness, but not their moves from previous games, claiming that they will not need them.|$|E

25|$|In 1885 one of {{the leading}} rugby clubs, Fremantle, decided to change to Australian Rules. It was quickly joined by three other clubs - , Victorians, and a team of schoolboys from The High School.

And virtually overnight Australian rules football became the dominant code for the spectator as well.|$|E
25|$|Paynter was {{a member}} of the Federalist Party like the {{majority}} in Sussex County. While elsewhere the Federalists were declining as an effective political force, in lower Delaware they organized themselves well, and were far more acceptable to the agrarian, Anglican and Methodist establishment, than the Irish Presbyterians who dominated the majority Democratic-Republican Party in very different New Castle County. Statewide elections were competitive, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> counties were similar in population, and so the Federalists almost always won, both in the General Assembly and governorship.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, {{after years}} of {{centralised}} monopoly on radio and television, the governmental agency ORTF was split into several national institutions, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> already-existing TV channels and four national radio stations remained under state-control. It was only in 1981 that the government allowed free broadcasting in the territory, ending state monopoly on radio. French television was partly liberalised {{in the next two}} decade with the creation of several commercial channels, mainly thanks to cable and satellite television. In 2005 the national service Télévision Numérique Terrestre introduced digital television all over the territory, allowing the creation of other channels.|$|E

The institute offers high quality training for Lakota language teachers, educating them in Lakota linguistics and language teaching methodology. Since 2008 the institute also started offering classes for Lakota language learners.|$|E
