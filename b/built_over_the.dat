As there is no tow path, a line to haul the barge had to be floated under the bridge and then re-attached to the horse where the tow path resumed.|$|E

5|$|Abbotsford Bridge is a steel Allan truss-type bridge {{spanning}} the Murray River between Curlwaa, New South Wales, and Yelta, Victoria. It {{is the only}} remaining steel truss bridge with a lift span that crosses the Murray. Opened in 1928, the bridge was built by the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Public Works and was designed by Percy Allan. It was the second last lift-span bridge to be <b>built</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> river, the last being the Nyah Bridge, which opened in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Abrahams Creek {{is named}} after a {{historic}} Mohican chief of a village in the area.

Numerous bridges have been <b>built</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> creek since 1925. The Abrahams Creek Watershed Association operates in the watershed. A 500-million-gallon reservoir known as Frances Slocum Lake was built on the creek in 1965.|$|E

5|$|At Banagher, {{there are}} ridges {{on both sides}} of the river and roads were built along these many centuries ago. The first bridge was <b>built</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Shannon at that point as early as 1049. It was a place of great {{strategic}} importance because the Shannon and its lowlands provided a natural barrier between Connacht and Leinster. An army that wanted to cross the river had few choices; apart from Banagher, the only other suitable places were Athlone, Shannonbridge and Portumna.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, the {{regional}} policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period; but this view was shown to be wildly optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been <b>built</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> preceding forty years.|$|E
5|$|Floodlights were erected at {{the ground}} in 1956 and the £9,000 cost nearly sent the club into bankruptcy. However, Norwich's success in the 1958–59 FA Cup (where as a Third Division club they reached the semi-final, losing to First Division Luton Town after a replay) secured the {{financial}} status of the club and provided sufficient funds for a cover to be <b>built</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> South Stand. In 1963, the record was set for attendance at Carrow Road: a crowd of 43,984 watched a sixth round FA Cup match against Leicester City, and the South Stand was covered shortly afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Further along {{from the}} Welsh Bridge is the Porthill Bridge, a {{pedestrian}} suspension bridge running between the Quarry and Porthill, built in 1922. The next bridge {{along the river}} is Kingsland Bridge, a privately owned toll bridge, and the subsequent bridge is the Greyfriars Bridge, a pedestrian bridge between Coleham and the town centre. Following the Greyfriars Bridge is the English Bridge, historically called Stone Bridge, which was rebuilt in the 1930s. Beyond it is the railway station, which is partly <b>built</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> river. After the station is Castle Walk Footbridge, another modern pedestrian footbridge.|$|E

In 1832, the Glens Falls Feeder Canal opened, further improving transportation in Queensbury. Sixteen years later, in 1848, a plank road was <b>built</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> old Military Road.|$|E
