5|$|Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} {{the birth of}} five babies {{in the town of}} Martinsburg, West Virginia, who were born with tails. The mother of the most recent baby, Amanda Nelligan, tells the agents that the father of her baby is Luke Skywalker. By researching the baby's chromosomes it is discovered that all five share the same father. The parents of the children blame the local fertility doctor, who had used insemination to impregnate all of the mothers but Nelligan. Mulder spots a janitor nearby with signs that he formerly had a tail. When he runs Mulder chases him and catches him. The janitor, Eddie Van Blundht, is discovered to be the father of all of the children. Scully believes Eddie used a date rape drug although Mulder questions how he could <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> to give it to the women.|$|E
25|$|If Scotland {{became an}} {{independent}} state, {{students from the}} rest of the UK would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> in which students {{from the rest of}} the EU are. A University of Edinburgh study found that this would cause a loss in funding and could potentially squeeze out Scottish students. The study suggested three courses of action for an independent Scotland: introduce tuition fees for all students; negotiate an agreement with the EU where a quota of student places would be reserved for Scots; or introduce a separate admissions service for students from other EU member states, with an admission fee attached. It concluded that the EU may allow a quota system for some specialist subjects, such as medicine, where there is a clear need for local students to be trained for particular careers, but that other subjects would not be eligible. The study also found that their third suggestion would run against the spirit of the Bologna agreement, which aims to encourage EU student mobility.|$|E
25|$|Räikkönen {{was handed}} a {{reprimand}} from the stewards over his late race contact with Magnussen while they elected {{not to take}} any action over the first lap incident between Button and Pérez. Magnussen was adamant that Räikkönen was {{to blame for the}} incident, saying that he drove defensively but that the driver made an overtaking attempt, while Räikkönen admitted following his contact with Chilton earlier in the race, he was willing to attempt aggressive manoeuvres. Pérez blamed Button for his retirement, saying that he was battling his teammate Hülkenberg and did not expect Button to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> he placed himself in {{because of the lack of}} space for another car. Button made no comment on the incident. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner reckoned that despite Vettel's turbocharger failing, the driver would not allow his frustrations to get the better of him, and stated Ricciardo's challenge on Hamilton in the event's closing period was an indication that the approach the team used was correct but noted a realistic overtake was not possible unless the challenged driver made an error.|$|E

25|$|By July, the {{operation}} still showed little progress. Phase I of Operation Mongoose {{drew to a}} close. The Special Group provided plans on March 14, 1962 for {{the first phase of}} {{the operation}} until the end of July 1962. There were four main objectives for Phase 1, a. was to gather hard intelligence on the target area, b. undertake all other political, economic, and covert actions short of creating a revolt in Cuba or the need for U.S. armed intervention, c. be consistent with U.S. overt policy and <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> to pull away with minimum loss of assets in U.S. prestige, d. Continue JCS planning and essential preliminary actions for a decisive U.S. capability for intervention. During Phase I the Punta del Este conference was a major U.S. political action to isolate Castro and neutralize his influence in the Hemisphere. President Kennedy's successful visit to Mexico was another major U.S. political action with an impact upon the operation but was not directly tied to the operation. Two political operations were performed in Phase I: counter Castro-Communist propaganda exploitation of May Day and to arouse strong Hemisphere reaction to Cuban military suppression of the hunger demonstration at Cardenas in June. Another key interest for Operation Mongoose was the Cuban refugees as it was thought they wanted to overthrow the Communist regime in Havana and recapturing their homeland. The refugees wee given open U.S. assistance to remain in this country yet are involved in covert actions in a limited way. Policy limitations of audibility and visibility were taken into consideration for the handling and use of the refugee potential. As Phase 1 drew to a close Phase II projected plan was written up and considered four possibilities. The first one was to cancel operational plans and treat Cuba as a Bloc nation and protect Hemisphere from it. The next possibility was to exert all possible diplomatic, economic, psychological, and other pressures to overthrow the Castro-Communist regime without overt employment of U.S. military. Another possibility was to help the Cubans overthrow the Castro-Communist regime with a step-by-step phase to ensure success including the use of military force if required. The last possibility was to use a provacation and overthrow the Castro-Communist regime by U.S. military force. In his July review, Lansdale recommended a more aggressive plan of action in the near future. He believed that time was of the essence, especially with the intensified Soviet military build-up in Cuba at the time. New plans to recruit more Cubans to infiltrate the Castro regime, interrupt Cuban radio and television broadcasts, and the deployment of commando sabotage units were drawn up.|$|E
500|$|On May 10, Bell {{was stopped}} in Olla, Louisiana, for {{speeding}} {{and not having}} proper vehicle insurance while on a weekend pass from his sentence. Bell {{was not supposed to}} leave Monroe, Louisiana, during the pass. The vehicle was towed {{due to the lack of}} insurance. In an interview televised on CNN on August 24, 2008, Bell admitted to having struck Barker in 2006 and described Jena as [...] "a real racist town". On August 27, 2008, the Louisiana High School Athletic Association turned down Bell's request for an extra year of athletic eligibility. Marcus Jones, Bell's father, blamed Bell's attorney at the time of the plea agreement for the denial. [...] "If it weren't for his attorney, Mychal would be able to play football", Jones said. [...] "They coerced him into taking that plea agreement. If he wouldn't have taken that plea, he wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> he's in now." [...] In 2014, Bell was attending Southern University in Baton Rouge.|$|E

2500|$|Sam Hughes – Senior Militia {{officer and}} later a Federally elected cabinet minister. As a very {{patriotic}} individual, Hughes {{became involved in the}} Boer war as a member of Brigadier-General Herbert Settle's expedition after Hughes unsuccessfully tried to raise his own brigade of soldiers. Hughes was noted by his colleagues for having a dislike of professional soldiers and he was noted for being an exceptional leader of irregular soldiers, whom he preferred to lead in combat. [...] However, Hughes was dismissed and was sent home in the summer of 1900 for; sending letters back home which were published outlining British command incompetence, his impatience and boastfulness and his providing surrendering enemies favourable conditions. When he arrived back in Canada, Hughes became very active politically, and he would eventually start his political career with the Conservatives. When he became a member of parliament, Hughes would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> to become the Canadian Minister of Defence and Militia in 1911, just prior the outbreak of World War I. This was a position that Hughes would be dismissed from in 1916, due once again to his impatience, among other reasons.|$|E

It seems really to be supposed that a Trimmer means a cowardly person who always goes over to the stronger side. It really means a highly chivalrous person who always goes over to the weaker side; like one who trims a boat by sitting where there are few people seated.
