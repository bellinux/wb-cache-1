Friday underwent an operation to have tattoos removed from his fingers during the summer break, and afterwards joined a hippie commune in Cornwall, neglecting to inform Reading of this latter decision. He was absent without explanation when training started for the 1974–75 season in July 1974, arriving only {{on the day of}} a closed-doors friendly against Watford. Despite his lack of training, he far out-performed the rest of the team. He continued to play well when the League programme began the following month. By September 1974 he was attracting the interest of First Division sides Sheffield United and Arsenal. The former had been following him since the game at Barnsley <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>February,</b> when he had still been an amateur. Arsenal manager Bertie Mee personally attended Reading's 4–2 home win over Rotherham United on 12 September, but neither his team nor Sheffield United attempted to sign Friday.|$|E
5|$|When the National Party {{was formed}} in 1936 from the merger of Reform and the United Party, {{publicity}} {{was one of the}} major considerations.

Initially, all financial members were to receive this monthly newsletter, aimed at being a counterpart to Labour's Standard.

500|$|The {{following}} year, in 1909, Hogan {{relocated to}} Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he replaced local ball club manager Clarence [...] "Pop" [...] Foster, who had managed the Red Roses since 1907. [...] Once Hogan signed a contract, Foster {{moved on to}} lead another club in Trenton, New Jersey. [...] The Lancaster team's momentum escalated during the 1909 season, and in July of that year, Sporting Life reported that the Red Roses club was drawing positive attention. [...] "The fast pace at which the Lancaster bunch has been going lately has been {{the talk of the}} league", the paper stated. [...] "Marty Hogan was not given much consideration as a pennant aspirant when the season opened, but the plucky Red Roses manager has been 'sawing wood' and not talking". [...] Indeed, by the close of the 1909 season, the Lancaster Red Roses had worked up a 7539 record, seizing the championship of the Tri-State League. [...] As Spalding's Baseball Guide (1910) reported: [...] "Lancaster, under manager Marty Hogan, won its first pennant in the league, and the top rung of the ladder was only gained by the hardest kind of fighting". [...] Sporting Life indicated that Hogan was confident of the outcome early in the season. [...] "After his return from the first trip around the circuit", wrote reporter G. H. Hartley, [...] "Marty said to your correspondent that he saw nothing in the league that was better than his team". [...] Hartley noted that, on the closing day of the season, Hogan accepted the Farnsworth Cup, [...] "the Tri-State trophy", on behalf of his team. [...] "Between the first and second innings the [...] players presented Manager Marty Hogan with a beautiful silver set and a silver loving cup", he added. [...] The inscribed silver cup reportedly left Hogan [...] "so surprised that he was unable to respond". [...] On September 7, 1909, one day after the contest, the Reading Eagle stated, [...] "A great crowd witnessed the final game, in which Hogan's gallant band trimmed the Trenton wanderers". [...] The newspaper added, [...] "The real enthusiasm was awakened, however, by the floating of the championship pennant, awarded by a Phila. [...] paper". [...] A key participant in the team's successful performance was a young pitcher named Stan Coveleski, who went on to post a record of 53 wins and 38 losses during his three seasons with Lancaster. He made his professional debut with the Philadelphia Athletics three seasons later. [...] Indeed, the Ogden Standard had praised Hogan as a [...] "live wire" [...] <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>February</b> 1909, when he [...] "grabbed up the three brothers of Harry Coveleski of the Phillies, and had them all sign contracts". [...] Highlights of the season may have included an exhibition game with the Philadelphia Phillies, which was scheduled to be held in Lancaster on April 2, 1909.|$|E
