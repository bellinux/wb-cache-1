50|$|Winemaking in Bordeaux is the {{collection}} of processes used to make Bordeaux wine. Winemaking in Bordeaux differs from winemaking in other places both because of the Bordelais climate {{and because of the}} particular Bordeaux style which the wine-maker is aiming for. A large number of processes are involved: pruning, training, spraying, (green harvesting), harvesting, (sorting), (de-stemming), crushing, fermentation, pressing, barrel-ageing, blending, bottling and <b>bottle-ageing.</b>|$|E
30|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} (LAB) {{contribute to}} taste and texture {{of a wide range}} of fermented products and inhibit the growth of spoilage bacteria (Mozzi et al. 2010). This includes the application of LAB in winemaking to increase the stability of wines that undergo barrel or <b>bottle-ageing.</b> This process, the malolactic fermentation (MLF), normally occurs after the alcoholic fermentation (AF). Apart from the decarboxylation of L-malic into L-lactic acid, MLF removes carbon sources of other microorganisms and bestows sensory changes to the wine (Bartowsky 2005). The genera mainly found during MLF are Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus and Oenococcus. Due to its high tolerance to low pH and higher amounts of SO 2 and ethanol, Oenococcos oeni is the primary species encountered during spontaneous MLF (Capozzi et al. 2010). Furthermore, O. oeni is the preferred organism for malolactic starter cultures, since the presence of Lactobacillus sp. and Pediococcus sp. during MLF can lead to development of spoilage aroma and off-flavours (Moreno-Arribas and Polo 2005). However, also O. oeni is able to generate for example acetic acid, diacetyl (buttery flavour), mannitol (viscous, sweet) and mousy off-flavour (Bartowsky 2009). Additionally, O. oeni needs several weeks to degrade malic acid completely, and growth of LAB is often delayed or can even fail (Zhang and Lovitt 2005). Consequently, innovations are desirable to reduce malic acid in a faster and more efficient way.|$|E

40|$|Available {{data show}} that {{ochratoxin}} A (OTA) is a possible contaminant of wine and its concentration is higher in red wines than in white and rosé. The aim of this work was to study the fate of OTA during the main stages of the winemaking process (crushing, maceration, alcoholic fermentation, malo-lactic fermentation, <b>bottle-aging)</b> {{and the influence of}} technological treatments on OTA concentration in order to identify the critical process steps. Attention was focused on red winemaking, in different wineries in the south of Italy, with two naturally OTA contaminated grape varieties (‘Negroamaro’ and ‘Primitivo’) and on different vintages (2001 – 2002 – 2003). The results show that no OTA is produced during winemaking, but each operation during winemaking can modify OTA content. The OTA present in grapes to a certain degree is released to the juice during crushing. Maceration increases the OTA content, while alcoholic and malo-lactic fermentation cause a reduction in OTA in the wine...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Knowledge of the {{formation}} and fate of aroma compounds is important {{to an understanding of}} the processes that affect wine composition and flavour. This study aimed to investigate the competitive formation and degradation of 1, 1, 6 -trimethyl- 1, 2 -dihydronaphthalene (TDN) and 2, 2, 6, 8 -tetramethyl- 7, 11 -dioxatricyclo[6. 2. 1. 01, 6]undec- 4 -ene (Riesling acetal) under wine storage conditions. Methods and Results: 1, 1, 5 -trimethyl- 3, 6 -dihydroxy- 9, 9 -ethylenedioxymegastigm- 4 -ene was synthesised in the laboratory by using standard organic chemistry transformation methodology and was subsequently used to prepare both Riesling acetal and TDN. At 45 °C in model wine, approximately 40 % of Riesling acetal was converted to TDN after 60 days at pH 3. 2, whereas 80 % was converted after 60 days at pH 3. 0, as established by GC/MS analysis. Under more vigorous conditions, this conversion was complete and the TDN thus formed was completely stable. Conclusion: Riesling acetal is a precursor to TDN at wine pH, rather than a competing end-product formed by the acid-catalysed hydrolysis of precursors common to both compounds. TDN is chemically stable to wine acid. Significance of the Study: The findings provide a clearer understanding of the factors affecting the concentration of TDN (kerosene, <b>bottle-age</b> aroma) in older wines and thereby have the potential to indicate strategies for modulating {{the formation}} of TDN.

40|$|The {{practice}} of extended bottle aging to increase wine quality is traditionally {{carried out by}} both wine producers as well as wine collectors. Mainly red wines are anaerobically bottle-aged to increase the complexity of sensory characteristics. Past research {{on the evolution of}} red wine aroma during aging has mainly focused on wood-derived characters during barrel-aging, or those related to the release of grape-derived, sugar-bound precursors due to acid hydrolysis. The latter reactions may result in enhance fruity and floral aromas during post-fermentation aging in barrels or tanks plus <b>bottle-aging</b> (2 ̆ 2 bottle bouquet 2 ̆ 2) notes such as leather, honey, or tobacco. This research investigated the origin of wine sensory characteristics generally described as 2 ̆ 2 savory 2 ̆ 2 or umami-type aromas. The most common savory aromas used to describe aged red wines in the scientific and consumer literature include beef broth (bouillon), cured, smoked and grilled meats, wild mushrooms, vegetables and herbs, roasted nuts, caramel, and soy sauce. It was postulated that Maillard reactions, a series of chemical reactions between reducing sugars and compounds with free amino groups, can occur under wine-like conditions (relatively low pH and storage temperature, aqueous solution) though at very slow reaction rates to produce savory aromas over the course of years or even decades of aging. In this study, professional wine judges were employed to select a range of commercial wines that display particular savory aromas. Subsequently, the use of a trained descriptive analysis panel was utilized to evaluate in detail a subset of the wines identified. The goal was to compare the tasting abilities of trained panelists to those of wine competition judges, and to generate savory aroma profiles for the wines. The wines with the highest intensity savory notes were analyzed via gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) to identify contributing aroma compounds. Based on established Maillard reaction products in the enology literature, several compounds related to savory, umami-type aromas were screened for, including 2 -acetylthiazole, 2 -acetyl- 2 -thiazoline, 4 -methylthiazole, 2, 4 -dimethylthiazole, 2, 4, 5,-trimethyloxazole, 2 -methyl- 3 -furanthiol, and 2 -furanmethanethiol. Although no thiazoles, oxazoles or furanthiols could be detected, other compounds were found to be of savory odor-impact including methionol (raw potato, cauliflower), γ-butyrolactone (caramel), γ-nonalactone (coconut), pantolactone (cotton candy), eugenol (cloves), isobutyric acid (cheese), and 5 -methylfurfural (almond, burnt sugar), among others. It is hypothesized that these compounds act synergistically to create a savory sensory experience by nose, even if present in concentrations below threshold individually. This work helps to expand the specificity and detail, at which wines can be described, by wine researchers, producers and consumers. The information provides a basis for future work investigating optimum aging parameters to increase the formation of desirable savory aroma compounds that can increase the complexity and thereby the perceived quality and value of certain wine-styles. ...|$|R
