Many Sanskrit terms were borrowed phonetically, but given completely different meanings. One significant concept {{borrowed from}} Buddhism was that of reincarnation.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{religious}} <b>beliefs</b> <b>are</b> represented among the novel's characters. Jacob Brattle is an unbeliever. Puddleham is a Primitive Methodist. The Stowte family, {{to which the}} marquis belongs, are Low Church Anglicans, and Fenwick is High church and latitudinarian. Their charity is tested by their response to Carry Brattle, and it is Fenwick who passes the test. As William Cadbury expresses it, Puddleham has been hardened by too much doctrine, Jacob Brattle by too little.|$|E

Buddhism is practiced by around 2% of the population, and is concentrated among Filipinos of Chinese descent. The remaining population is divided between a number of religious groups, including Hindus, Jews, and Baha'is.|$|E

50|$|The {{difference}} between knowledge and <b>beliefs</b> <b>is</b> as follows: A <b>belief</b> <b>is</b> an internal thought or memory which exists in one's mind.

5|$|Belief in {{prenatal}} fetal awareness, mental {{communication between}} mother and unborn child, and emotional attachment of child to mother as a prenatal phenomenon, are concepts that connect easily to the unfounded assumption that all adopted children suffer emotional disorders. These <b>beliefs</b> <b>are</b> also congruent with CAM psychotherapies such as attachment therapy (not based on attachment theory), which purport to bring about age regression and to recapitulate early development to produce a better outcome.|$|E
5|$|Fenwick's <b>beliefs</b> <b>are</b> {{similar to}} Trollope's own. In his early life, the novelist was a {{supporter}} of the Tractarians. However, beginning in about the mid-1860s, his sympathies tended increasingly toward the Broad church. He defended Bishop Colenso, expressed doubt about the literal truth of the Old Testament, and questioned the doctrine of eternal punishment contained in the Athanasian Creed.|$|E
5|$|In Tlingit and Haida cultures, raven {{was both}} a trickster and creator god. Related <b>beliefs</b> <b>are</b> {{widespread}} among the peoples of Siberia and northeast Asia. The Kamchatka Peninsula, for example, {{was supposed to have}} been created by the raven god Kutkh. There are several references to common ravens in the Old Testament of the Bible and it is an aspect of Mahakala in Bhutanese mythology.|$|E
50|$|These <b>beliefs</b> <b>were</b> not {{necessarily}} held universally held among the Tagalogs, however.

50|$|Appeal to <b>belief</b> <b>is</b> valid {{only when}} the {{question}} <b>is</b> whether the <b>belief</b> exists.Appeal to popularity is therefore valid {{only when the}} questions <b>are</b> whether the <b>belief</b> <b>is</b> widespread and to what degree. I.e., ad populum only proves that a <b>belief</b> <b>is</b> popular, not that it is true. In some domains, however, it is popularity rather than other strengths that makes a choice the preferred one, for reasons related to network effects.|$|R

5|$|Lionhead Studios used Michael Bratman's belief–desire–intention {{model to}} {{simulate}} creatures' learning {{and decision making}} processes. A creature forms an intention by combining desires, opinions, and beliefs. <b>Beliefs</b> <b>are</b> attributed to lists that store data about various world objects. Desires are goals the creature wants to fulfill, expressed as simplified perceptrons. Opinions describe ways of satisfying a desire using decision trees. For each desire, the creature selects the belief with the best opinion, thus forming an intention or goal.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{feminism}} {{challenges the}} essentialist view of gender as biologically intrinsic. For example, Anne Fausto-Sterling's book, Myths of Gender, explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of gender. In Delusions of Gender, Cordelia Fine disputes {{scientific evidence that}} {{suggests that there is}} an innate biological difference between men's and women's minds, asserting instead that cultural and societal <b>beliefs</b> <b>are</b> the reason for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences.|$|E
5|$|Other wrong <b>beliefs</b> <b>are</b> killing {{those who}} are in state of {{happiness}} or {{those who are}} in meditation under wrong belief that the mental state at the time of death will be perpetuated in future lives. It is also a wrong belief that killing of self and others is justified as the soul that is imprisoned in the body will be permanently released and achieve salvation.|$|E

5|$|The {{beliefs of}} the general public about the effect of {{extraterrestrial}} contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious <b>beliefs</b> <b>are.</b> The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian <b>beliefs</b> <b>are</b> one {{possible}} source {{for understanding the}} symbolism in the mysteries of Isis. J. Gwyn Griffiths, an Egyptologist and classical scholar, extensively studied Book 11 of Metamorphoses and its possible Egyptian background. He pointed out similarities between the first initiation in Metamorphoses and Egyptian afterlife beliefs, saying that the initiate took {{on the role of}} Osiris by undergoing symbolic death. In his view, the imagery of the initiation refers to the Egyptian underworld, the Duat. Griffiths argued that the sun {{in the middle of the}} night, in Lucius' account of the initiation, might have been influenced by the contrasts of light and dark in other mystery rites, but it derived mainly from the depictions of the underworld in ancient Egyptian funerary texts. According to these texts, the sun god Ra passes through the underworld each night and unites with Osiris to emerge renewed, just as deceased souls do.|$|E
25|$|Traditional <b>beliefs</b> <b>are</b> still practised by the Orang Asal people. Loosely {{classified}} as animism, the <b>beliefs</b> <b>are</b> not recognised {{by the state}} as a religion. Animistic <b>beliefs</b> <b>are</b> passed down through oral tradition {{due to the lack of}} a writing system in indigenous groups, who call their beliefs agama adat (traditional or customary religions). The different religions are rather varied, with different names and concepts for their supreme god and other supernatural deities. Most of the <b>beliefs</b> <b>are</b> heavily influenced by the environment, with physical features such as mountains, trees, valleys, and rivers being sacred. A close relationship with nature is nurtured, and the relationship of humans and nature is a strong part of the religion, with everyday activities such as hunting and gathering having spiritual significance.|$|E

60|$|Thus a <b>belief</b> <b>is</b> true when it {{corresponds}} to a certain associated complex, and false when it does not. Assuming, {{for the sake of}} definiteness, that the objects of the <b>belief</b> <b>are</b> two terms and a relation, the terms being put in a certain order by the 'sense' of the believing, then if the two terms in that order are united by the relation into a complex, the <b>belief</b> <b>is</b> true; if not, it is false. This constitutes the definition of truth and falsehood that we were in search of. Judging or believing is a certain complex unity of which a mind is a constituent; if the remaining constituents, taken in the order which they have in the belief, form a complex unity, then the <b>belief</b> <b>is</b> true; if not, it is false.|$|R
25|$|Bart Ehrman {{argues that}} the {{historical}} Jesus was an apocalyptic preacher, and that his apocalyptic <b>beliefs</b> <b>are</b> recorded in the earliest Christian documents: Mark and the authentic Pauline epistles. The earliest Christians believed Jesus would soon return, and their <b>beliefs</b> <b>are</b> echoed in the earliest Christian writings. The Gospel of Thomas proclaims that the Kingdom of God is already present for those who understand the secret message of Jesus (Saying 113), and lacks apocalyptic themes. Because of this, Ehrman argues, the Gospel of Thomas was probably composed by a Gnostic {{some time in the}} early 2nd century.|$|E
