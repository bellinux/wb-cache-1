40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the therapeutic effects of two anastomoses (canaliculus-to-lacrimal sac anastomosis and end-to-end anastomosis) on nasolacrimal laceration for over 7 mm from the <b>broken</b> <b>end</b> to the dacryon. MethodsA total of 71 patients (44 males and 27 females, aged 16 - 55 years, mean= 34. 32 years) with fresh canalicular laceration were treated in our hospital from March 2003 to April 2008. Under a microscope, 37 patients {{were treated with}} lacrimal sac anastomosis (the treatment group) and 34 with end-to-end anastomosis (the control group), detaining silicone tubes till 3 months later. ResultsThe cure rate of the treatment group (89. 19 %) wassignificantly higher than that ofthecontrol group (55. 56 %). Class I cure rates were 70. 27 % in the treatment group and 47. 06 % in the control group, {{and the difference between}} the two groups was significant (P 0. 05). ConclusionsWhen the distance from the <b>broken</b> <b>end</b> to the dacryon is over 7 mm, especially when it is necessary to find the paranasal <b>broken</b> <b>end</b> of the lacrimal canaliculus with dacryocystotomy, canaliculus-to-lacrimal sac anastomosis is a better treatment method than end-to-end anastomosis for laceration of lacrimal canaliculus...|$|R

40|$|When a {{dicentric}} chromosome breaks in mitosis, the <b>broken</b> <b>ends</b> {{cannot be repaired}} by normal mechanisms that join two <b>broken</b> <b>ends</b> since each end is in a separate daughter cell. However, in the male germline of Drosophila melanogaster, a <b>broken</b> <b>end</b> may be healed by de novo telomere addition. We find that Chk 2 (encoded by lok) and P 53, major mediators of the DNA damage response, have strong and opposite influences on the transmission of broken-and-healed chromosomes: lok mutants exhibit a large increase in the recovery of healed chromosomes relative to wildtype control males, but p 53 mutants show a strong reduction. This contrasts with the soma, where mutations in lok and p 53 have the nearly identical effect of allowing survival and proliferation of cells with irreparable DNA damage. Examination of testes revealed a transient depletion of germline cells after {{dicentric chromosome}} induction in the wildtype controls, and further showed that P 53 {{is required for the}} germline to recover. Although lok mutant males transmit healed chromosomes at a high rate, <b>broken</b> chromosome <b>ends</b> can also persist through spermatogonial divisions without healing in lok mutants, giving rise to frequent dicentric bridges in Meiosis II. Cytological and genetic analyses show that spermatid nuclei derived from such meiotic divisions are eliminated during spermiogenesis, resulting in strong meiotic drive. We conclude that the primary responsibility for maintaining genome integrity in the male germline lies with Chk 2, and that P 53 is required to reconstitute the germline when cells are eliminated owing to unrepaired DNA damage...|$|R

30|$|DNA {{double strand}} break repair (DSBR) pathways are {{generally}} classified {{based on whether}} sequence homology is used to join the <b>broken</b> DNA <b>ends.</b> Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which does not depend upon sequence homology, is the key repair pathway during the G 0 /G 1 stages of the cell cycle [10]. During NHEJ, once a DSB is formed the <b>broken</b> <b>ends</b> are bound by Ku proteins (ku 70 and ku 80), which form a heterodimer and insulate the DNA ends from nucleolytic erosion [11, 12]. The Ku proteins foster direct ligation of the <b>broken</b> DNA <b>ends</b> by the specialized ligase complex Dnl 4 –Lif 1 [12]. This complex can execute a blunt end ligation reaction on clean DNA ends, i.e. 3 ′-OH and 5 ′-phosphate groups. If the <b>broken</b> DNA <b>ends</b> are not clean, then further processing by nucleases and polymerases are necessary to ligate the loose ends [12]. However, {{in the midst of}} this process of genome editing, small deletions and insertions might be introduced at the junction site. This is why this pathway if often regarded to be an error-prone recovery mechanism [2, 13, 14].|$|R
40|$|HeT-A {{elements}} {{are a new}} family of transposable elements in Drosophila that are found exclusively in telomeric regions and in the pericentric heterochromatin. Transposition of these elements onto <b>broken</b> chromosome <b>ends</b> has been implicated in chromosome healing. To monitor the fate of HeT-A elements that had attached to <b>broken</b> <b>ends</b> of the X chromosome, we examined individual X chromosomes from a defined population {{over a period of}} 17 generations. The ends of the X chromosomes with new HeT-A additions receded {{at the same rate as}} the <b>broken</b> <b>ends</b> before the HeT-A elements attached. In addition, some chromosomes, approximately 1 % per generation, had acquired new HeT-A sequences of an average of 6 kb at their ends with oligo(A) tails at the junctions. Thus, the rate of addition of new material per generation matches the observed rate of terminal loss (70 - 75 bp) caused by incomplete replication at the end of the DNA molecule. One such recently transposed HeT-A element which is at least 12 kb in length has been examined in detail. It contains a single open reading frame of 2. 8 kb which codes for a gag-like protein...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{effect of}} a TiO 2 {{nanoparticle}} suspension (4 mg in 5 ml distilled water) doped or not with gold or iron, complexed or not with α- or β-cyclodextrin, on the mitotic division was studied. The treatment was performed in the M cellular mitotic cycle phase, in the meristematic tissue of Nigella damascena radicels, being analyzed the cytogenetic modifications. The cyclodextrin type and the ratio between cyclodextrin and titanium dioxide affect the percentage of normal cells and the chromosome aberration type. The TiO 2 complexed with α-cyclodextrin did not facilitate the reunion of the chromosome <b>broken</b> <b>ends</b> (absence of bridges in anaphase and in telophase). The titanium dioxide doped with iron, complexed with α- or β-cyclodextrin, also reduced the percentage of reunion of the <b>broken</b> <b>ends</b> of the chromosomes. These findings suggest {{the possibility of using}} doped or undoped TiO 2, complexed with α-cyclodextrin, in the anticarcinogen therapy...|$|R

40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} the clinical effect of using microscope {{to find the}} <b>broken</b> <b>end</b> of lacrimal canalicular and annular-intubation during traumatic lacrimal-canaliculi anastomosis. METHODS:In 52 cases(52 eyes) with traumatic canaliculi laceration from March 2010 to December 2014, microscopy was used to find the <b>broken</b> <b>end</b> of lacrimal canalicular and annular-intubation implantation was performed during anastomosis. At 2 ～ 3 mo after the surgeries, annular tubes were pulled out and patients were followed up for 3 ～ 12 mo. RESULTS:In all the 52 cases, 47 cases were cured, 3 cases were improved, and 2 cases were not healed. The 2 not-healed patients were cured after treated by laser. CONCLUSION:The application of the annular-intubation for canaliculi laceration under the microscope is simple and the curative effect is reliable, besides, the the patients' appearance and normal work were not affected when the annular-tube was reserved. And it can {{reduce the incidence of}} eyelid deformity. Generally, it's a good methord for canaliculi laceration...|$|R
40|$|Telomeres of Drosophila melanogaster contain {{arrays of}} the retrotransposon-like {{elements}} HeT-A and TART. Terminally deleted chromosomes {{can be maintained}} for many generations. Thus, <b>broken</b> chromosome <b>ends</b> behave as real telomeres. It was previously shown that gene conversion may extend the <b>broken</b> <b>ends.</b> Here {{we found that the}} frequency of terminal DNA elongation by gene conversion strongly depends on the genotype. A dominant E(tc) (Enhancer of terminal gene conversion) mutation markedly increases the frequency of this event but does not significantly influence the frequency of HeT-A and TART attachment to the <b>broken</b> chromosome <b>end</b> and recombination between directly repeated sequences {{at the end of the}} truncated chromosome. The E(tc) mutation was mapped to the 91 - 93 region on chromosome 3. Drosophila lines that bear the E(tc) mutation for many generations have telomeres, consisting of HeT-A and TART elements, that are longer than those found in wild-type lines. Thus, the E(tc) mutation plays a significant role in the control of telomere elongation in D. melanogaster...|$|R
5000|$|Ku {{protein is}} a dimeric protein complex, a {{heterodimer}} of two polypeptides, Ku70 and Ku80. Ku protein forms a ring structure. An early step in non-homologous end joining DNA repair of a double-strand break is the slipping of a Ku protein (with its ring protein structure) over each <b>end</b> of the <b>broken</b> DNA. The two Ku proteins, {{one on each}} <b>broken</b> <b>end,</b> bind {{to each other and}} form a bridge. [...] This protects the DNA ends and forms a platform for further DNA repair enzymes to operate. After the <b>broken</b> <b>ends</b> are rejoined, the two Ku proteins still encircle the now intact DNA and can no longer slip off an end. The Ku proteins must be removed or they cause loss of cell viability. [...] The removal of Ku protein is performed either by RNF8 ubiquitination of Ku80, allowing it to be released from the Ku protein ring, or else by NEDD8 promoted ubiquitination of Ku protein, causing its release from DNA.|$|R
