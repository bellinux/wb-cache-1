5|$|Ideas {{were often}} first sketched by Oliver, before {{she moved to}} {{construction}} in three dimensions. When preparing commissions, she would draw on the ideas of clients or {{the nature of the}} site. For large works she created maquettes (or models), sometimes in plasticine, on other occasions using copper wire or, in the case of her 2002 sculpture Globe, wood and metal. Oliver would produce the more delicate works herself. Many were created by crafting and joining wire to create abstract forms. These were built around moulds, twisting the metal into place with pliers, before severing it with wirecutters. Joins were soldered or <b>brazed</b> (though in some pieces, the wire was woven). In Web (2002), copper pieces were sewn together using wire.|$|E
25|$|CuproBraze is an {{alternative}} to soldered copper/brass plate fin, soldered copper brass serpentine fin, and <b>brazed</b> aluminium serpentine fin. The technology enables <b>brazed</b> copper serpentine fins {{to be used in}} copper-brass heat exchanger designs. These are less expensive to manufacture than soldered serpentine fin designs. They are also stronger, lighter, more durable, and have tougher joints.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Thermal anchor {{is one of}} the key {{components}} in ITER magnet supports to maintain the low temperature for superconductor coils. The sufficient attachment of the cooling pipe to the support plates is needed to minimize the risk of helium leakage. <b>Brazing</b> {{is one of the}} best choices. Three kinds of special <b>brazing</b> filler, including SnPb <b>brazing</b> filler, Ag-based and Cu-based <b>brazing</b> filler, were developed, which have good thermal conductivity, and toughness for <b>brazing</b> connection of SS 316 LN at both room temperature and 77 K environment. Some <b>brazing</b> technologies, including induction <b>brazing,</b> vaccum <b>brazing,</b> fire <b>brazing,</b> and arc <b>brazing,</b> have being investigated...|$|R

25|$|A {{variety of}} small {{features}} — bottle cage mounting holes, shifter bosses, cable stops, pump pegs, cable guides, etc. — {{are described as}} braze-ons because they were originally, and sometimes still are, <b>brazed</b> on.|$|E
25|$|For low temperatures, {{junctions}} can be <b>brazed</b> or soldered, {{however it}} may be difficult to find a suitable flux and this may not be suitable at the sensing junction due to the solder's low melting point.|$|E
25|$|The {{masonry bit}} shown {{here is a}} {{variation}} of the twist drill bit. The bulk of the tool is a relatively soft steel, and is machined with a mill rather than ground. An insert of tungsten carbide is <b>brazed</b> into the steel to provide the cutting edges.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- <b>Brazing</b> {{generally}} require cumbersome apparatus be it induction, vacuum or torch <b>brazing.</b> In torch <b>brazing,</b> metals {{are joined}} by using the oxyacetylene cylinder. It thus becomes difficult to carry out <b>brazing</b> at the places where {{it is not possible}} to take heavy gas cylinders and <b>brazing</b> apparatuses. So it is tried to figure out the method to carry out <b>brazing</b> at places where conventional <b>brazing</b> is not feasible. And thus <b>Brazing</b> was done by usual Shielded Metal Arc Welding, by developing the electrode composition for the joining process of three different kinds of metals and alloys, without using the oxyacetylene cylinder and other heavy <b>brazing</b> apparatus. The results show that this newly developed <b>brazing</b> method gave almost same appropriate welding results as it is given by the conventional <b>brazing</b> method.

The components are assembled with ceramic-to-metal interfaces and metal-to-metal interfaces. <b>Brazing</b> is accomplished by active <b>brazing</b> of the ceramic-to-metal interfaces and non-active <b>brazing</b> of the metal-to-metal interfaces. Specific combinations of active <b>braze</b> alloys and non-active <b>braze</b> alloys are provided for various combinations of dewar materials...|$|R
50|$|Torch <b>brazing</b> {{is by far}} {{the most}} common method of {{mechanized}} <b>brazing</b> in use. It is best used in small production volumes or in specialized operations, and in some countries, it accounts for a majority of the <b>brazing</b> taking place. There are three main categories of torch <b>brazing</b> in use: manual, machine, and automatic torch <b>brazing.</b>|$|R
25|$|The main {{grade of}} copper used for {{electrical}} applications is electrolytic-tough pitch (ETP) copper (CW004A or ASTM designation C11040). This copper {{is at least}} 99.90% pure and has an electrical conductivity of at least 101% IACS. ETP copper contains {{a small percentage of}} oxygen (0.02 to 0.04%). If high conductivity copper needs to be welded or <b>brazed</b> or used in a reducing atmosphere, then oxygen-free copper (CW008A or ASTM designation C10100) may be used.|$|E
25|$|A Forstner bit could {{bore the}} {{mounting}} hole for the hinge, but particle board and MDF are very abrasive materials, and steel cutting edges soon wear. A tungsten carbide cutter is needed, but the complex {{shape of a}} forstner bit is difficult to manufacture in carbide, so this special drill bit with a simpler shape is commonly used. It has cutting edges of tungsten carbide <b>brazed</b> to a steel body; a center spur keeps the bit from wandering.|$|E
25|$|The Bodeo was {{considered}} simple and robust. Due to the revolver being {{produced by a}} multitude of manufacturers, {{the quality of the}} weapon varied greatly. Frames were made {{from a wide variety of}} materials ranging from brass to <b>brazed</b> copper plates. The gate was connected to the hammer with the barrel screwed into the frame. Ejection was achieved by the rod normally housed in the hollow axis pin. The hammer block was designed to prevent firing unless the trigger was fully cocked.|$|E
50|$|<b>Braze</b> welding {{is the use}} of {{a bronze}} or brass filler rod coated with flux to join steel workpieces. The {{equipment}} needed for <b>braze</b> welding is basically identical to the equipment used in <b>brazing.</b> Since <b>braze</b> welding usually requires more heat than <b>brazing,</b> acetylene or methylacetylene-propadiene (MAP) gas fuel is commonly used. The name {{comes from the fact that}} no capillary action is used.|$|R
40|$|In this work, high-energy {{electron}} beam <b>brazing</b> of a ceramic part is modeled numerically.

25|$|Small-diameter coil {{technologies}} {{are becoming more}} popular in modern air conditioning and refrigeration systems because they have better rates of heat transfer than conventional sized condenser and evaporator coils with round copper tubes and aluminum or copper fin {{that have been the}} standard in the HVAC industry. Small diameter coils can withstand the higher pressures required by the new generation of environmentally friendlier refrigerants. Two small diameter coil {{technologies are}} currently available for air conditioning and refrigeration products: copper microgroove and <b>brazed</b> aluminum microchannel.|$|E
25|$|Tungsten carbide {{and other}} {{carbides}} are extremely hard and can drill virtually all materials, while holding an edge longer than other bits. The material is expensive {{and much more}} brittle than steels; consequently they are mainly used for drill-bit tips, small pieces of hard material fixed or <b>brazed</b> onto {{the tip of a}} bit made of less hard metal. However, it is becoming common in job shops to use solid carbide bits. In very small sizes it is difficult to fit carbide tips; in some industries, most notably PCB manufacturing, requiring many holes with diameters less than 1mm, solid carbide bits are used.|$|E
25|$|The {{eye of a}} hook, {{although}} some hooks are technically eyeless, is {{the point where the}} hook is connected to the line. Hook eye design is usually optimized for either strength, weight and/or presentation. There are different types of eyes to the hooks. Typical eye types include the ring or ball eye, a <b>brazed</b> eye-the eye is fully closed, a tapered eye to reduce weight, a looped eye—traditional on Atlantic Salmon flies, needle eyes, and spade end—no eye at all, but a flattened area to allow secure snelling of the leader to the hook. Hook eyes can also be positioned one of three ways on the shank—up turned, down turned or straight.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{three-dimensional}} {{computer code}} which is employed for modelling of fluid flow and heat transfer during <b>braze</b> gap filling on vacuum <b>brazing</b> {{has been developed}} by using SIMPLE algorithm and VOF method. By the aid of this program, the flow behavior of liquid filler metal, the location and wave of the free surface, {{as well as the}} temperature distribution can be simulated. In order to verify the computational results, experiments of vacuum <b>brazing</b> thin plate weldment with 0. 03 mm and 0. 2 mm <b>braze</b> gap have been made respectively. The result of comparisons between calculated data and experimental data show that the <b>brazing</b> gap {{is one of the most}} important technological parameters that influences the flow pattern of liquid filler metal during <b>braze</b> gap filling and the <b>brazing</b> seam formation process significantly, and the 3 -D modelling of <b>braze</b> gap filling are rather accurate and reliable, thereby providing a useful and effective analytic tool for <b>brazing</b> technological design...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a detailed {{examination of the}} structure of the transitional area between a <b>brazing</b> alloy and the parent material, the dimensions of the diffusion zones that are created, and the influence on them of a change in the <b>brazing</b> parameters. Connections between Ni-based <b>brazing</b> alloys (NI 102) with a small content of B and AISI 321 stainless steel (X 6 CrNiTi 18 – 10) were created in a vacuum (10 − 2 Pa) at various <b>brazing</b> temperatures and for various holding times at the <b>brazing</b> temperature. Various specimens were tested. First, the <b>brazing</b> alloys were wetted and the dependence of the wetting on the <b>brazing</b> parameters was assessed. Then a chemical microanalysis was made of the interface between the <b>brazing</b> alloy and the parent material. The individual diffusion zones were identified on pictures from a light microscope and REM, and their dimensions, together with their dependence on the <b>brazing</b> parameters, were determined...|$|R
50|$|Induction <b>brazing</b> {{is often}} used in higher {{production}} runs. It produces uniform results and is very repeatable. There are many industrial equipment where Induction <b>brazing</b> is used. For instance Induction is used for <b>brazing</b> carbide to shaft.|$|R
25|$|Hooks are {{designed}} as either single hooks—a single eye, shank and point; double hooks—a single eye merged with two shanks and points; or triple—a single eye merged with three shanks and three evenly spaced points. Double hooks are formed {{from a single}} piece of wire and {{may or may not have}} their shanks <b>brazed</b> together for strength. Triple hooks are formed by adding a single eyeless hook to a double hook and brazing all three shanks together. Double hooks are used on some artificial lures and are a traditional fly hook for Atlantic Salmon flies, but are otherwise fairly uncommon. Triple hooks are used on all sorts of artificial lures as well as for a wide variety of bait applications.|$|E
25|$|Lugged steel {{construction}} uses standard cylindrical steel tubes which are connected with lugs, external fittings made {{of pieces of}} steel (sometimes stainless steel) which fit over {{the ends of the}} tubing. Before assembly, the builder cuts the tubes to the desired length and precisely mitres their ends, providing a tight fit. The end of the tubes are inserted into the lugs and subsequently <b>brazed</b> with a silver or brass filler metal. The lug greatly increases the strength of the joint by distributing the molten filler metal over a larger surface area via capillary action. When brazing a bicycle frame, builders may use a small positioning structure called a jig to hold the tubes in place and maintain their precise alignment and frame geometry.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} making the large open end (bell) of a brass {{instrument}} is called metal beating. In making the bell of, for example, a trumpet, a person lays out a pattern and shapes sheet metal into a bell-shape using templates, machine tools, handtools, and blueprints. The maker cuts out the bell blank, using hand or power shears. He hammers the blank over a bell-shaped mandrel, and butts the seam, using a notching tool. The seam is <b>brazed,</b> using a torch and smoothed using a hammer or file. A draw bench or arbor press equipped with expandable lead plug is used to shape and smooth the bell and bell neck over a mandrel. A lathe is used to spin the bell head and to form a bead {{at the edge of}} bell head. Previously shaped bell necks are annealed, using a hand torch to soften the metal for further bending. Scratches are removed from the bell using abrasive-coated cloth.|$|E

25|$|An ammeter shunt is {{a special}} type of current-sensing resistor, having four {{terminals}} and a value in milliohms or even micro-ohms. Current-measuring instruments, by themselves, can usually accept only limited currents. To measure high currents, the current passes through the shunt across which the voltage drop is measured and interpreted as current. A typical shunt consists of two solid metal blocks, sometimes brass, mounted on an insulating base. Between the blocks, and soldered or <b>brazed</b> to them, are one or more strips of low {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} (TCR) manganin alloy. Large bolts threaded into the blocks make the current connections, while much smaller screws provide volt meter connections. Shunts are rated by full-scale current, and often have a voltage drop of 50 mV at rated current. Such meters are adapted to the shunt full current rating by using an appropriately marked dial face; no change need to be made to the other parts of the meter.|$|E
