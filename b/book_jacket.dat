5|$|Alongside his {{stand-alone}} illustrations, in July 1926 Hergé began {{production of}} a comic strip for Le Boy-Scout Belge, Les Aventures de Totor (The Adventures of Totor), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures of a Boy Scout patrol leader, the comic initially featured written captions underneath the scenes, but Hergé began to experiment with other forms of conveying information, including speech bubbles. Illustrations were also published in Le Blé qui lève (The Wheat That Grows) and other publications of the Catholic Association of Belgian Young People, and Hergé produced a <b>book</b> <b>jacket</b> for Weverbergh's novel, The Soul of the Sea. Being young and inexperienced, still learning his craft, Hergé sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived Atelier de la Fleur de Lys (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, a janitor, who {{was also}} a student, {{borrowed}} a book from the library, to read during breaks. The book was Notre Dame vs the Klan, a historical account of how the then-despised Catholic minority in 1924, confronted the then-powerful Ku Klux Klan. The <b>book</b> <b>jacket</b> portrayed the hooded Klansmen. A co-worker complained after seeing the cover, as did his union supervisor. Eventually the school's Affirmative Action Officer issued a formal rebuke to the janitor. After much discussion and criticism she backed away from that rebuke and subsequently retired. After more criticism and a passage of several months, the university chancellor apologized and issued letters of disapproval to the original complainant.|$|E

50|$|Starting in 2010, Juniper Books began {{creating}} custom <b>book</b> <b>jackets</b> {{for use in}} the libraries he {{designs for}} his clients, which can either be singular or create a pattern over the bindings of several books aligned together. Nate Pedersen wrote of the process that, “Say, for example, a client wants one thousand books on natural history, but with green jackets and black silhouettes of birds in flight spanning the spines. Wine takes that request, builds a personalized book collection, and then employs an artist to design the collection’s <b>book</b> <b>jackets.</b> When printed and wrapped around the books, the collection becomes a piece of art.” The method is also used to “upcycle” old books that are of little use to the owner, creating a décor piece out of the old volumes. Art on the <b>book</b> <b>jackets</b> have included basic digital art to commissioned murals.|$|R
