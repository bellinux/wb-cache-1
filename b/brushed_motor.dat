Acceptance test levels are set with margin expected flight/operations levels and qualification test levels are set above the expected operation levels to check for the survivability of DC <b>brush</b> <b>motor</b> in space. Performance testing is important to design and integration in a planned test process in which DC <b>brush</b> <b>motor</b> were tested under actual or simulated mission profile environments to disclose design deficiencies and to provide information on failure modes and mechanisms. Statistical models are helpful in this process. The Logistic Regression Model is the commonly used parametric statistical models {{and is one of}} the statistical techniques that are used for analyzing and predicting performance with binary outputs. The objective was to develop Logistic Regression Model and is designed to examine the categorization of dependent variables in the quantitative analysis for the performance of DC <b>brush</b> <b>motor.</b> The work carried out demonstrates the development of the Logistic Regression Model for performance prediction of the DC <b>brush</b> <b>motors</b> for deploying unfurlable antenna.

50|$|Because the {{controller}} implements the traditional brushes functionality it needs the rotor's orientation/position (relative to the stator coils).

50|$|When {{converting}} electricity into mechanical power, brushless motors {{are more}} efficient than <b>brushed</b> <b>motors.</b> This improvement {{is largely due to}} the frequency at which the electricity is switched determined by the position sensor feedback.

50|$|The car used {{a custom}} {{designed}} electronic shifting actuator {{made from a}} standard RC car motor and a planetary gear box from a power drill.

The overall actuator weight was around 1.2 lbs. There were positive and negative results of the system. With new brushes in the motor and proper tweaking it was capable of very fast shifts (~15 ms), and was able to perform very well for automatic up-shifting during acceleration runs. However, the <b>brushed</b> <b>motor</b> was unreliable in this implementation (very low rev, turning only a few turns at a time, commonly stalled), which meant that the motor required constant tinkering.

The BLDC motor is an inside out <b>brushed</b> <b>motor</b> because the armature is in the stator and the magnets are in the rotor and its operating characteristics {{are similar to those}} of the conventional brushed Dc motor. The brushless DC motor (BLDCM) is receiving wide attention for industrial applications because of their high torque density, high efficiency and small size. Brushless DC motor (BLDC) The objective of the paper is to develop a digital Pulse Width modulation (PWM) technique speed control algorithm for BLDC motor and also reduce harmonic content that should be produced by inverter during switching time in Kiel Arm software which is an environment for model based development of embedded controller for ARM processor.

40|$|Nowadays {{it is very}} {{important}} in different fields the sensor data collection in for a continuous study and control of the environmental conditions. The interest of this project is based on that fact. This document contains the development and design of an aquatic remote operated vehicle (ROV) so that it can collect data from sensors installed in an environmental station. The ROV's function is to collect this data performing a path through different nodes through the water. This ROV is an aquatic hovercraft, it has not a motor underwater, and it has it over the platform with a propeller that creates thrust with the air. On the other hand, it has two rudders that can deviate the airflow of the propeller to realize the maneuvers. The size of the ROV is about 55 cm of length, 35 cm width and 30 cm height. The brain of this vehicle is the Pixhawk controller that has a large equipment of telemetry, GPS, PPM encoder, etc. It has equipped an onboard Arduino UNO which is the responsible of the actuation of the <b>brushed</b> <b>motor</b> and responsible of the data management and data logger of the sensors. The ROV receives the data from nodes and it transmits it to a central equipment which is monitoring the ROV continuously and where the measured data is desired to be at. Manual navigation will be executed through a transmitter of 2. 4 GHz model FS-G 2 E, which has a range of 250 meters and has two channels for actuation: power and heading. For the link between the ROV and a node it is used the bluetooth technology that is offered by the module RN- 41. It can be programmed easily with an Arduino. The data that is transmitted is humidity and temperature and it has the format {xx. x;yy. y}. In addition, it is implemented a meteorology station on a node in order to realize real measurements of the environmental conditions and so that the system works with real values. Finally, on the annexes it is possible to see the plans for the construction of the ROV and the station. Otherwise, there are the specifications of different modules that are used through this project...|$|E
