5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, as salvage {{operations}} became deeper and longer, an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, joint pain and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. The problem was already well known among workers building tunnels and bridge footings operating under pressure in caissons and was initially called caisson disease; {{it was later}} renamed the bends because the joint pain typically caused the sufferer to stoop. Early reports of the disease had been made {{at the time of}} Charles Pasley's salvage operation, <b>but</b> <b>scientists</b> were still ignorant of its causes.|$|E
5|$|Science fiction films often depict humans {{successfully}} repelling alien invasions, <b>but</b> <b>scientists</b> {{more often}} take {{the view that}} an extraterrestrial civilization with sufficient power to reach the Earth {{would be able to}} destroy human civilization with minimal effort. Operations that are enormous on a human scale, such as destroying all major population centers on a planet, bombarding a planet with deadly neutron radiation, or even traveling to another planetary system in order to lay waste to it, may be important tools for a hostile and totalitarian civilization.|$|E
5|$|Sharks {{generally}} are opportunistic feeders, <b>but</b> <b>scientists</b> propose that megalodon was largely predatory. Its great size, high-speed swimming capability, and powerful jaws, {{coupled with a}} formidable feeding apparatus, made it an apex predator capable of consuming {{a broad spectrum of}} animals. A study focusing on calcium isotopes of extinct and extant elasmobranch sharks and rays revealed that megalodon fed at a higher trophic level than the contemporaneous great white shark, that is to say it was higher up in the food chain.|$|E

5|$|The {{classification}} of birds is a contentious issue. Sibley and Ahlquist's Phylogeny and Classification of Birds (1990) is a landmark {{work on the}} {{classification of}} birds, although it is frequently debated and constantly revised. Most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate, <b>but</b> <b>scientists</b> disagree about {{the relationships between the}} orders themselves; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been brought to bear on the problem, but no strong consensus has emerged. More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.|$|E
5|$|Definite Acrocanthosaurus fossils {{have been}} found in the Twin Mountains Formation of {{northern}} Texas, the Antlers Formation of southern Oklahoma, and the Cloverly Formation of north-central Wyoming and possibly even the Arundel Formation in Maryland and in Florida. These geological formations have not been dated radiometrically, <b>but</b> <b>scientists</b> have used biostratigraphy to estimate their age. Based on changes in ammonite taxa, the boundary between the Aptian and Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous has been located within the Glen Rose Formation of Texas, which may contain Acrocanthosaurus footprints and lies just above the Twin Mountains Formation. This indicates that the Twin Mountains Formation lies entirely within the Aptian stage, which lasted from 125 to 112million years ago. The Antlers Formation contains fossils of Deinonychus and Tenontosaurus, two dinosaur genera also found in the Cloverly Formation, which has been radiometrically dated to the Aptian and Albian stages, suggesting a similar age for the Antlers. Therefore, Acrocanthosaurus most likely existed between 125 and 100 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} nineteenth century, Megalosaurus {{was seen as}} the typical {{carnivorous}} dinosaur. If remains were found that were not deemed sufficiently distinct to warrant a separate genus, often single teeth, these were classified under Megalosaurus, which thus began to function as a wastebasket taxon, a sort of default genus. Eventually, Megalosaurus contained more species than any other non-avian dinosaur genus, most of them of dubious validity. During the twentieth century, this practice was gradually discontinued; <b>but</b> <b>scientists</b> discovering theropods that had been mistakenly classified under a different animal group in older literature, still felt themselves forced to rename them, again choosing Megalosaurus as the default generic name.|$|E

5|$|The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) is {{responsible}} for the scientific operation of the telescope and the delivery of data products to astronomers. STScI is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) and is physically located in Baltimore, Maryland on the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University, one of the 39 US universities and seven international affiliates that make up the AURA consortium. STScI was established in 1981 after something of a power struggle between NASA and the scientific community at large. NASA had wanted to keep this function in-house, <b>but</b> <b>scientists</b> wanted it to be based in an academic establishment. The Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility (ST-ECF), established at Garching bei München near Munich in 1984, provided similar support for European astronomers until 2011, when these activities were moved to the European Space Astronomy Centre.|$|E
5|$|The {{prominent}} markings that criss-cross {{the moon}} {{seem to be}} mainly albedo features, which emphasize low topography. There are few craters on Europa because its surface is tectonically active and young. Some theories suggest that Jupiter's gravity is causing these markings, as one side of Europa is constantly facing Jupiter. Also, volcanic water eruptions splitting the surface of Europa, and even geysers have been considered as a cause. The color of the markings, reddish-brown, is theorized {{to be caused by}} sulfur, <b>but</b> <b>scientists</b> cannot confirm that, because no data collection devices have been sent to Europa. Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and likely has an iron core. It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Over 1,700 {{species of}} trees and other {{vascular}} plants are native to the park. Another 170 species {{are considered to be}} exotic species and are non-native. Of the eight conifer tree species documented, Lodgepole Pine forests cover 80% of the total forested areas. Other conifers, such as Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and Whitebark Pine, are found in scattered groves throughout the park. As of 2007, the whitebark pine is threatened by a fungus known as white pine blister rust; however, this is mostly confined to forests well to the north and west. In Yellowstone, about seven percent of the whitebark pine species have been impacted with the fungus, compared to nearly complete infestations in northwestern Montana. Quaking Aspen and willows are the most common species of deciduous trees. The aspen forests have declined significantly since the early 20th century, <b>but</b> <b>scientists</b> at Oregon State University attribute recent recovery of the aspen to the reintroduction of wolves which has changed the grazing habits of local elk.|$|E

25|$|Zinc-steel {{gridiron}} pendulums {{are made}} with 5 rods, but the thermal expansion of brass is closer to steel, so brass-steel gridirons usually require 9 rods. Gridiron pendulums adjust to temperature changes faster than mercury pendulums, <b>but</b> <b>scientists</b> found that friction of the rods sliding in their holes in the frame caused gridiron pendulums to adjust {{in a series of}} tiny jumps.

For these reasons mercury pendulums were used in the highest precision clocks, but gridirons were used in quality regulator clocks.|$|E
