5|$|Red foxes may kill small mustelids like weasels, stone martens, pine martens, stoats, kolonoks, polecats {{and young}} sables. Eurasian <b>badgers</b> may live {{alongside}} red foxes in isolated sections of large burrows. It {{is possible that}} the two species tolerate each other out of mutualism; foxes provide <b>badgers</b> with food scraps, while <b>badgers</b> maintain the shared burrow's cleanliness. However, cases are known of <b>badgers</b> driving vixens from their dens and destroying their litters without eating them. Wolverines may kill red foxes, often while the latter are sleeping or near carrion. Foxes in turn may kill unattended young wolverines.|$|E
5|$|There {{are a few}} {{inconsistencies}} {{from the}} naturalist's view point. Foxes and <b>badgers</b> are not necessarily mutual enemies in nature. <b>Badgers</b> do not normally invade the homes of foxes, and are not typically dirty. <b>Badgers</b> do sometimes eat bunnies, not from a predilection for bunnies but {{simply because they are}} omnivorous. The inconsistencies are few and employed to create individual characters rather than evoke an archetypical fox and badger.|$|E

5|$|While {{different}} leader {{training courses}} are conducted at Gilwell Park, {{the most prominent}} is Wood Badge. Francis Gidney, the first Camp Chief, conducted the first Wood Badge course at Gilwell Park 8–19 September 1919. Gilwell Park became the home of leadership training in the Scout movement. Leaders {{from all over the}} world receive automatic membership in 1st Gilwell Park Scout Group (Gilwell Troop 1) on completion of the Wood Badge course. These leaders are henceforth called Wood <b>Badgers</b> or Gilwellians. Any location in which Wood <b>Badgers</b> meet is called Gilwell Field.

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Centre, McMillin played professionally with the Milwaukee <b>Badgers</b> and Cleveland Indians—two early National Football League (NFL) teams—in 1922 and 1923. He later {{returned}} to the NFL, coaching the Detroit Lions from 1948 to 1950 and the Philadelphia Eagles {{for the first two}} games of the 1951 season before his death. McMillin's career NFL coaching mark was 14–24.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1920s, NFL {{membership}} {{had grown}} to 25 teams, and a rival league known as the American Football League was formed. The rival AFL folded after a single season, but it symbolized a growing interest in the professional game. Several college stars joined the NFL, most notably Red Grange from the University of Illinois, who was taken on a famous barnstorming tour in 1925 by the Chicago Bears. Another scandal that season centered on a 1925 game between the Chicago Cardinals and the Milwaukee <b>Badgers.</b> The scandal involved a Chicago player, Art Folz, hiring a group of high school football players {{to play for the}} Milwaukee <b>Badgers,</b> against the Cardinals. This would ensure an inferior opponent for Chicago. The game was used to help prop up their win-loss percentage and as a chance of wrestling away the 1925 Championship away from the first place Pottsville Maroons. All parties were severely punished initially; however, a few months later the punishments were rescinded. Also that year a controversial dispute stripped the NFL title from the Maroons and awarded it to the Cardinals.|$|E

50|$|Pure <b>badger</b> are <b>badger</b> {{hair brushes}} {{that use the}} most common hair from the underbelly of a <b>badger,</b> the hair which covers around 60% of a <b>badger's</b> body. This hair varies greatly in softness, {{pliability}} and color. Pure <b>badger</b> hair is usually dark in color, but fluctuates from a light tan to a near-black or silvery sheen. The hair is coarser than 'best' or 'silvertip' hair due to its larger shaft. Brushes made exclusively with pure <b>badger</b> hair cost significantly less than finer <b>badger</b> hair. Most often, pure <b>badger</b> brush hairs are trimmed to shape, resulting in somewhat stiff, rough ends.|$|R
50|$|The name of {{the town}} was taken from <b>Badger</b> Brook, which flows through the town and is a {{tributary}} of the Exploits River.

5|$|For {{their final}} home {{game of the}} season, Michigan hosted the Wisconsin <b>Badgers.</b> Michigan looked to extend its two-game win streak, but faced a tough challenge, as Wisconsin was ranked 6th in the AP Poll and was fresh off of an 83–20 {{pounding}} of Indiana. During the previous meeting between the two schools, Wisconsin won by a score of 45–24, with Scott Tolzien throwing 5 touchdown passes during the game.|$|E
50|$|When <b>Badger</b> is well {{he leaves}} the Warden and tries to {{convince}} {{the rest of his}} friend {{that the best way to}} survive is to live with the Warden.

On the way back <b>Badger</b> meets Kestrel and saves him from Ginger who wants revenge for Kestrel's earlier attack on him. Once <b>Badger</b> returns the animals then decide to search for food by human houses.|$|R

5|$|One week later, Michigan {{suffered}} a 48–28 loss to Wisconsin. Robinson passed for 239 {{yards and two}} touchdowns, rushed for 121 yards and two touchdowns, set the Division I FBS record for rushing yards by a quarterback and become the first NCAA player with 1,500 rushing yards and 2,000 passing yards in the same season. However, Robinson's individual performance was overshadowed by the 20-point loss to the <b>Badgers.</b>|$|E

50|$|Best <b>badger</b> are brushes {{made with}} the finer and more pliable hairs from 20 - 25% of the <b>badger's</b> body. It is longer in length and lighter in color than 'pure' <b>badger</b> hair. A 'best' <b>badger</b> brush is more densely filled with hair than the 'pure' <b>badger</b> brush and will produce a {{correspondingly}} greater lather. However, some wet shavers argue that the variance between {{the quality of a}} 'pure' and a 'best' <b>badger</b> brush is negligible. Best <b>badger</b> and better quality brush hairs are often fit so that the ends {{do not have to be}} cut to shape.|$|R
