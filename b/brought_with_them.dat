5|$|Groups of Hasidic Jews from Eastern Europe began {{establishing}} {{communities in}} the late 18th century, and <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> their traditional Ashkenazi cuisine, developing, however, distinct local variations, notably a peppery, caramelized noodle pudding known as kugel yerushalmi.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century German {{immigrants}} <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> Riesling vines, named Johannisberg Riesling to qualify them as “legitimate” German Riesling. New York, particularly in the Finger Lakes region, was one of the earliest U.S. producers of Riesling. Plantings started to appear in California by 1857 and followed in Washington State in 1871.|$|E
5|$|According to news reports, {{the first}} {{passenger}} trains {{left the city}} at 9:00am, and continued running throughout the day. Around 10:00am, General W. S. Hancock arrived and was followed by 360–400 federal troops from New York and Fort Monroe, who relieved those guarding Camden Station. They <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> two 12 pounder artillery pieces. From that point on, {{the men of the}} 5th and the federal troops took turns guarding the station.|$|E

5|$|Due to its {{location}} {{in the middle of}} the trade network of the ancient world, the cultural and social landscape of the city was complex, as the inhabitants had to deal with traders and envoys who <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> different customs from distant regions. The inventories of gifts presented to deities from the royal palace indicate that Qatna used the sexagesimal numeral system.|$|E
5|$|German {{settlers}} {{began arriving}} in North America in the mid-seventeenth century. They were particularly attracted by William Penn's promise {{of religious freedom}} in the colony of Pennsylvania, {{and came to the}} Philadelphia region in significant numbers. By 1683, the German population was large enough to form communities such as Germantown (now a neighborhood in Philadelphia). Many of these immigrants <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> their Lutheran faith and formed congregations in their new homeland.|$|E
5|$|Immigrants to Israel have {{incorporated}} {{elements of the}} cuisines of the cultures and countries whence they came. During approximately fifty years before 1948, there were successive waves of Jewish immigration, which <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> {{a whole range of}} foods and cooking styles. Immigrants arriving from central Europe brought foods such as schnitzel and strudels, while Russian Jews brought borsht and herring dishes, such as schmaltz herring and vorschmack (gehakte herring).|$|E

5|$|In 1977 (before the Yellow Jackets {{had even}} joined the ACC), this {{football}} series was {{being considered for}} termination by the administration of Georgia Tech. Clemson football fans, {{in an effort to}} show their economic impact on the Atlanta, Ga., area, <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> to Atlanta large stockpiles of two-dollar bills that were stamped with Clemson Tiger Paws. Georgia Tech leads Clemson in the all time series 50-25-2.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{a wave of}} Haitian, mostly musicians, to Dominica and the French Antilles (Guadeloupe and Martinique) <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> the kadans, a {{sophisticated}} form of music that quickly swept the island and helped unite all the former French colonies of the Caribbean by combining their cultural influences. These Haitians drew upon previous success from mini-jazz artists like Les Gentlemen, Les Leopards, and Les Vikings de Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|People {{from small}} {{villages in the}} hills near Genova, Italy {{were among the first}} to settle {{permanently}} in the Sierra Nevada foothills; they <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> traditional agricultural skills, developed to survive cold winters. A modest number of miners of African ancestry (probably less than 4,000) had come from the Southern States, the Caribbean and Brazil.|$|E

5|$|Queluz's {{architecture}} {{is representative of}} the final extravagant period of Portuguese culture that followed the discovery of Brazilian gold in 1690. From the beginning of the 18th century many foreign artists and architects were employed in Portugal to satisfy the needs of the newly enriched aristocracy; they <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> classical ideas of architecture which derived from the Renaissance. In its design, Queluz is a revolt against the earlier, heavier, Italian-influenced Baroque which preceded the Rococo style throughout Europe.|$|E
5|$|The earlier {{inhabitants}} of the Balkan Peninsula were an agricultural people who, using Animism, assigned a spirit to every aspect of nature. Eventually, these vague spirits assumed human forms and entered the local mythology as gods. When tribes from {{the north of the}} Balkan Peninsula invaded, they <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> a new pantheon of gods, based on conquest, force, prowess in battle, and violent heroism. Other older gods of the agricultural world fused with those of the more powerful invaders or else faded into insignificance.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{study of}} Barbadian music remains limited. Some song {{collections}} {{and other activities}} have been conducted, but there remain significant holes in scholarship, such as the musics of recent immigrants from China and India, who presumably have <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> styles of Indian and Chinese musics. Due {{to a lack of}} archaeological and historical records, the island's indigenous music is unknown. Since the 1970s, an increase in general interest in Barbadian culture has spurred greater study of music, and given an incentive to radio and television stations to create and maintain archives of cultural practices.|$|E

5|$|Andjar {{was one of}} {{the first}} native Indonesian film directors, with Bachtiar Effendi, Soeska, and Inoe Perbatasari. Said writes that Andjar was forced to follow the whims of the ethnic Chinese film moguls, which {{resulted}} in the films' shift toward commercial orientation, rather than the prioritisation of artistic merit. The film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that Andjar and his fellow journalists, upon joining JIF, <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> new ideas that helped the company flourish until it closed after the arrival of the Japanese; the company and its subsidiaries released fifteen films in two years.|$|E
5|$|Antemoro {{villages are}} {{primarily}} clustered {{in the southeastern}} coastal area near Vohipeno and Manakara. Society was traditionally divided into two broad categories: the mpanombily (or tompomenakely), who were nobles said to be descended from Arabs from Mecca, and the menakely, composed of the working and slave classes, who {{were said to have}} descended from the local Malagasy who submitted to the Arabs' rule, or alternately from slaves that the Arabs had <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> The mpanombily comprised many noble clans such as the Anakara, Onjatsy, Tsimaito, Antaiony, Antalaotra, Antaisambo, Antaimahazo and others. Particular clans within Antemoro society historically held distinct privileges and responsibilities. The butchering of certain animals for human consumption was assigned to specific clans.|$|E
5|$|Carpet weaving {{represents}} a traditional art, {{dating back to}} pre-Islamic times. During its long history, the art and craft of the woven carpet has integrated different cultural traditions. Traces of Byzantine design can be detected, Turkic peoples migrating from Central Asia, as well as Armenian people, Caucasian and Kurdic tribes either living in, or migrating to Anatolia, <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> their traditional designs. The arrival of Islam {{and the development of}} the Islamic art also influenced Turkish carpet design. The history of its designs, motifs and ornaments thus reflects the political and ethnic history and diversity of the area of Asia minor. However, scientific attempts were unsuccessful, as yet, to attribute a particular design to a specific ethnic, regional, or even nomadic versus village tradition.|$|E
50|$|Contemporary {{accounts}} by missionaries {{blamed the}} sandalwood traders for the outbreaks. However, all Europeans, including missionaries, <b>brought</b> disease <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> Erromangans sought reprisal by killing European and Polynesian missionaries, their converts and other visitors.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{cessation}} of open violence, the city set about forming two new regiments of national guard to expand available forces. The local news recounted on the 24th, that Abbot's engineer corps had re-purposed the armory of the 5th Regiment {{for use as a}} recruiting station, toward the goal of forming the now authorized 8th Regiment, to include a company of artillery. They <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> from the armory of the 6th, two howitzers, 2,000 rounds of ammunition, and 250 muskets. The Governor and Adjutant General put out a call for volunteers to fill each regiment with 1,000 men. General James Howard was chosen to command the 7th, and General Charles E. Phelps the 8th.|$|E
5|$|In {{the west}} were the Gaelic (Goidelic)-speaking people of Dál Riata with their royal {{fortress}} at Dunadd in Argyll, with close {{links with the}} island of Ireland, from which they <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> the name Scots. In 563 a mission from Ireland under St. Columba founded the monastery of Iona off {{the west coast of}} Scotland and probably began the conversion of the region to Christianity. The kingdom reached its height under Áedán mac Gabráin (r. 574–608), but its expansion was checked at the Battle of Degsastan in 603 by Æthelfrith of Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|Skiing in Revelstoke {{started in}} 1890 with {{the influx of}} Norwegian {{immigrants}} who <b>brought</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> their tradition of home-made skies. By the early 1910s, ski jumping was a major pastime during winter, with small ski jumps being built all around the town. Revelstoke Ski Club was founded in 1914 and reached 102 members within a year. Starting in 1915, the club's annual high point was the Winter Carnival Tournament. The first tournament was held in 1915, and featured competitions in cross-country skiing and ski jumping for boys under 16, and awarded the title of Champion of British Columbia. The inaugurate tournament was won by Nels Nelson.|$|E
