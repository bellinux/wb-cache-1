2500|$|In 1985, the Twins {{repeated}} as Manitoba and Western champions {{and found}} themselves in a best-of-seven marathon with the Corner Brook Royals in Corner Brook, Newfoundland. [...] So far from home, the Twins may have accomplished one of the greatest feats in amateur hockey history. [...] The Corner Brook Royals crushed the jet-lagged Twins 9–5 in game one. [...] Game two went a little better for the Twins, as they forced overtime but were overpowered by the Royals 3–2. [...] Game three needed to be won by the Twins, but again they were embarrassed by the Eastern champions 9–5. [...] With their <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> down 3-games-to-none, the Twins began their trek back. [...] Game four ended with a 4–2 nail-biter of a win for the Twins. [...] Game five saw the Twins embarrass a seemingly deflated Royals squad 8–3. [...] The Twins took game six 2–0 and then finished the comeback with an unbearably close 5–4 victory. [...] With their third Allan Cup victory, the Twins became the only team in Allan Cup history to come back from a 3–0 deficit to win the Allan Cup. [...] As the tournament is now in a round robin format and a revert to best-of-sevens are very unlikely, the feat may never be repeated. In 1986 they were eliminated 4 game to 1 in the league final by the St. Boniface Mohawks.|$|E
