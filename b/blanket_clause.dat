Ingram, from Melbourne, Australia, had booked a school trip to New York in 2011, however {{had to cancel}} {{on the advice of}} her psychiatrist due to severe depression.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{application}} of the good practices <b>blanket</b> <b>clause</b> on the example of the Suppression of Unfair Competition Act. First, the authors characterise the general functions and use of blanket clauses, then they focus on the one of their main interest. The authors analyse the origin of the clause as well as the actual understanding of good practice both in the doctrine and in judicial decisions, and subsequently compare the functioning, or application, of good practices and principles of community life to conclude that the application of a good practice clause is not efficient and its use in the future should be discontinued...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} issues {{relating}} to state control and state reaction to breaches of the rules discovered, using the example of Section 35 of the German Trade, Commerce and Industry Regulation Act (§ 35 Gewerbeordnung, GewO). This provision is the central norm in German law, {{on the basis of}} which entrepreneurial activities can be prohibited. In the introduction, the author provides an overview of different forms of control and discusses the role of the courts in general, but also in the context of reviewing the control measures taken by the state. The author agrees that jurisprudence (case law) is not a source of law in the countries of the European-Continental legal system. However, this should not lead to the wrong conclusion that the courts are neither qualified nor obliged to develop the law. After the introductory remarks, the author discusses the provisions contained in § 35 of the German Trade, Commerce and Industry Regulation Act (Gewerbeordnung). This example is of particular interest as it demonstrates various general principles of state control over private activities. While the provision originally contained a casuistic enumeration of individual cases, it nowadays uses a <b>blanket</b> <b>clause.</b> Accordingly, the concept of Unzuverlässigkeit ('unreliability ', which is not defined in more detail) is the definitional element for a disqualification from the practice of commercial activities. Hence, the courts' task in dealing with the respective cases has significantly changed, as the control process involves consideration of both public and private interests, as well as striking a fair balance between the opposing public and private interests. The author points out that this is also justified as the legislator can hardly foresee all cases to which the provision might appear in practice. In particular, the author points out that the German legislator, unlike the legislators in some transformation states, has opted for having as few restrictions as possible {{at the beginning of a}} commercial activity. In the second part, specific {{issues relating to}} a disqualification pursuant to Section 35 of the German Trade, Commerce and Industry Regulation Act are presented based on various court decisions. This is to show how the German courts interpret the indefinite legal term of 'unreliability'. It is highlighted that the determination of unreliability is a predictive decision rather than a sanctioning of conduct in the past. Moreover, it is pointed out that unreliability always has to be determined in relation to the respective trade...|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} {{regulatory}} impact assessments (RIAs) {{are an important}} method to improve the private law acquis that are currently overlooked. Many problems of unpredictability and inconsistency {{can be traced to}} poor regulatory choices in the private law acquis, including the overenthusiastic use of <b>blanket</b> <b>clauses</b> and the lack of coordination {{in the development of the}} acquis. RIAs are a very suitable means to prompt the legislator to reconsider these choices. The use of RIAs however currently shows severe shortcomings. Particularly, RIAs frequently contain doubtful and unsubstantiated assumptions, and they do not neutrally assess the benefits and detriments of all possible ways to develop the acquis. These shortcomings should be addressed if RIAs are to contribute to the quality of the private law acquis. A more thorough evaluation of past and future measures such as minimum and maximum harmonization, guidance, databases, and self-regulation and more coordination would contribute to the predictability and consistency of the private law acquis...|$|R
