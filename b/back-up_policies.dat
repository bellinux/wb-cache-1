40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{economic}} cost-effective analysis of water heating systems including solar water heating systems (SWHSs). This study finds that {{in situations where}} there is a winter, or a rainy season, the choice of the source of energy for the SWHS’s back-up during this period is critical for its overall cost-effectiveness. It is found that in the conditions of North Cyprus, an SWHS with electricity back-up is far superior to using electricity alone, however, it is inferior to heating water with either a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) water heater alone or an SWHS with an LPG <b>back-up.</b> <b>Policies</b> to promote water heating systems that reduce the use of electricity should not encourage the installation of SWHSs with electricity back-up. An LPG water heater or an SWHS with an LPG back-up are economically more cost-effective, with or without the inclusion of the social cost of carbon estimates.

50|$|The {{hospital}} is {{managed by the}} by-the-book bureaucrat Executive Director, Dr. Henry Dreyfoos (John Mahoney), whom is determined to uphold the government's policies by any means, {{to the point of}} directly cutting patient's acceptance rates by half and instituting rigorous dressing codes and supply upkeeping regulations. He's backed up by Chief of Medicine Leo Krutz (Jeffrey Tambor) and Chief Nurse Amelia Sturdeyvant (Julie Bovasso), whom follow and <b>back-up</b> Dreyfoos' <b>policies,</b> fearing for their jobs. Dreyfoos greatest opposition comes from the hospital's ER team led by surgeon Dr. Richard Sturgess (Ray Liotta), whom has no qualms in exposing Dreyfoos' politicking to the press when he has the opportunity (Mostly thanks to his friend Luther) and performing illegal midnight hospital supply thefts called 'midnight requisitions' to be able to properly perform surgeries. Dreyfoos is aware of Sturgess' activities, but can't prosecute him as he can't gather evidence.|$|R
40|$|Mortality {{attributable}} to major {{causes of death}} around 1980 has been estimated for different regions in the world. The World Health Organization's mortality data bank has been employed to derive the rates for the developed areas in the world whereas for the developing areas, cause-specific mortality has been estimated {{on the basis of}} total mortality using a linear regression method. For the cause grouping chosen, infectious and parasitic diseases claim one third of all deaths in the world. Although diseases of the circulatory system and neoplasms are the two most common causes of death in the developed countries, more than 50 % of all deaths in the world due to these causes occur in the developing world. Mortality due to injury and poisoning is—contrary to that due to the other main causes of death—almost independent of the level of development of the area. The results are aimed to assist the information <b>back-up</b> for health <b>policies</b> concerning the developing world. Statistics on causes of death are important and widely used for a number of purposes. They may be employed in explaining trends and differentials in overall mortality, in deciding on priorities for health action and the allocation of resources, in designing inter-vention programmes, and in the assessment an...|$|R
