40|$|A {{study of}} {{available}} data from various tests of <b>beveled</b> control <b>surfaces</b> {{has been made}} in an attempt to develop a rational method for predicting the effects of beveled trailing edges on the hinge-moment characteristics of control surfaces in both two- and three-dimensional flow. The results of the study indicated that the change in the included angle at the control-surface trailing edge formed a convenient basis on which a correlation could be made of the effects of various profile modifications on hinge-moment characteristics. It is believed that the formulas developed will allow reasonably accurate predictions of the hinge-moment characteristics of sealed <b>beveled</b> control <b>surfaces</b> if the characteristics of the original control surfaces are known. The presence of a gap at the control-surface hinge increased the effect of beveled trailing edges on the hinge-moment characteristics at small control-surface deflections but the available data were insufficient to allow as complete a correlation as was possible for sealed controls...|$|R

50|$|The {{most notable}} {{advantage}} of the scary sharp system is speed and cost. Anyone with access to sandpaper and a reasonably flat surface can sharpen any cutting tool, often with good results. Unlike traditional stones, no maintenance {{is required for the}} scary-sharp set-up, since the sharpening surface does not form a hollow with repeated, uneven usage. A hollowed surface is undesirable in most sharpening situations, an example being the flat surface required in the back (as opposed to the <b>beveled</b> <b>surface)</b> of most woodworking plane irons. Compared to stones, sandpaper is lower in cost as well. A fresh sheet of sandpaper often cuts significantly faster than a bench sharpening stone. For this reason, coarse-grit papers can be used to dress damaged cutting edge quickly, removing chips along the edge and preparing it for the next stage/grit of edge refinement.|$|E
50|$|The M1951 {{is a short}} recoil-operated, locked breech pistol with a {{vertically}} falling {{locking piece}} and an open top slide (the locking mechanism design {{was influenced by the}} Walther P38 pistol). The locking piece, located under the barrel, is unlocked by a sliding pin and locked back into battery by a <b>beveled</b> <b>surface</b> on the pistol's frame. The locking piece features two locking lugs that engage appropriate recesses cut into the slide's internal side surfaces. When the pistol is fired, the locking piece, integral with the slide, goes back together with the barrel which is locked to the slide. After a brief period of unrestricted travel of approx. 13 mm the unlocking pin on the rear barrel lug strikes the receiver and stops. As the barrel and slide continue back, the locking piece strikes the stationary plunger and is forced down into recesses in the slide. The barrel comes to rest but the slide continues rearward for a further 50 mm. Upon forward return, the slide picks up the barrel and the locking piece on the barrel lug is lifted up by the receiver cam to lock the barrel to the slide. The spring-loaded extractor is integrated into the slide, and the fixed-type ejector is integral to the pistol's frame. The pistol has a hammer striking mechanism (with an exposed hammer) and a single-action trigger with a disconnector, which enables semi-automatic fire only. A cross-bolt safety mounted on the weapon's frame (beneath the hammer) provides safe operation with a cartridge introduced into the chamber. In the “weapon safe” position (the safety's button pushed in to the left) the slide catch is disabled.|$|E

A maxillary right first premolar with an amalgam restoration presented a buccal cusp fracture. Chairside repair has been undertaken by conditioning the existing amalgam restoration with silica coating (30 μm CoJet®-Sand), phosphoric acid etching the <b>beveled</b> enamel <b>surface,</b> priming dentin, and application of a bonding agent on both enamel and dentin. Thereafter, the amalgam was silanized (ESPE®-Sil), and opaque resin was applied and polymerized to mask the amalgam.

Finally, the amalgam was refinished and refurbished and the composite was finished and polished...|$|R
40|$|The Basilica of San Marco is a {{singular}} {{case in the}} field of Cultural heritage, as it constitutes a construction site always active for the maintenance and preservation of the basilica itself. The continuous intervention of conservation, due to the particular environmental conditions of Venice and the opening to the public, together with the complexity of the building itself, imposes the need to identify an optimized management system. For this reason, in 2013 the Procurator of St. Marco Basilica commissioned the construction of a 3 D model of the Basilica to be used {{for the creation of a}} BIM. The model must meet the required precision of the scale of 1 : 50, and should also include, in addition to the geometric description, a description of the mosaic and marble surfaces of the basilica through high resolution orthophoto which are essential for the restoration of the mosaics. The complexity of the church and the large and continuous flow of public led to work in non-optimal conditions especially for the acquisition stage. The basilica has certain peculiarities that led to some important choices, for example the use of photogrammetry instead of laser scanning technique. The same technique was preferred also by the need to realize, in addition to the geometric model, high-resolution orthophotos of marbles and mosaic surfaces. The modelling of the basilica has highlighted a number of problems related to the building features. The basilica, indeed, is the result of the juxtaposition of elements (capitals, columns) with different origin, which therefore cannot be standardized in special libraries. Moreover, especially in the extensive mosaic areas, there are not edges that characterize the architecture, but only <b>beveled</b> <b>surfaces.</b> This has resulted in a change also in the modeling paradigm with the need to identify alternative systems even for the construction of simple elements. Therefore, we decided to model using NURBS since it is the method that allows greater adherence to reality and, at the same time, a model with acceptable dimensions in terms of navigation and usability. Only the most sculptural pieces such as capitals and statues have been replaced by mesh models. As we were interested in different elaborations, the results of this work are a geometric NURBS model for the subsequent insertion into BIM environment, with the possibility of extracting two-dimensional drawings such as plans and sections, a mesh model with low resolution textures for online navigation and high resolution orthophotos. The survey work and modeling has been almost completed for the interior of the basilica whereas only the external remains to be acquired and modeled. For the management of the entire work it was decided to use the data organization system already used by the Politecnico di Milano for the Duomo di Milano. The BIM 3 DSURVEY system will be essential not only to manage the finished model, but it has been very useful also during the construction phase because it allows us to divide the entire work into more work units. However, this system required some changes to meet the peculiarity of this BIM, in particular the need to append and link the orthophotos to real surfaces, in order to use the model also as a spatial index for the images...|$|R

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{determination of}} the sheet resistance and carrier depth profile, i. e. active dopant profile, of shallow junction isolated structures involving new high mobility materials, such as germanium, is a crucial topic for future CMOS development. In this work, we discuss the capabilities of new concepts based on micro machined, closely spaced contact probes (10 mu m pitch). When using four probes to perform sheet resistance measurements, a quantitative carrier profile extraction based {{on the evolution of}} the sheet resistance versus depth along a <b>beveled</b> <b>surface</b> is obtained. Considering the use of only two probes, a spreading resistance like setup is obtained with small spacing and drastically reduced electrical contact radii (similar to 10 nm) leading to a substantial reduction of the correction factors which are normally required for converting spreading resistance profiles. We demonstrate the properties of both approaches on Al+ implants in germanium with different anneal treatments...|$|E
40|$|As CMOS is {{approaching}} the 22 nm node, {{the importance of}} high-mobility materials such as Ge and GaAs is rapidly increasing. For the timely development of these new technologies accurate dopant and carrier-profiling solutions for source-drain extensions with these materials are required. Identical n-type-doped (Si, Se) layers on same and opposite type medium-doped layers on S. I. GaAs substrates will be investigated, with layer thicknesses ranging from 200 down to 50 nm and doping concentration levels up to 1 e 20 at/cm(3). In this work, secondary ion mass spectrometry {{will be used for}} dopant profiling. For GaAs carrier profiling, conventional spreading resistance probe, as commonly used in Si-CMOS, fails. Hence, reliable alternatives need to be found for characterizing these high-low structures. Techniques to be discussed range from the more conventional approaches such as Hall or electrochemical capacitance-voltage (performed by different laboratories), over micro-Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence along a <b>beveled</b> <b>surface,</b> up to more advanced approaches using scanning spreading resistance microscopy.

40|$|Epidural {{injection}} {{is commonly}} used to provide intraoperative anesthesia, postoperative and obstetric analgesia, and to treat acute radicular pain. Identification of the epidural space is typically carried out using the loss of resistance (LOR) technique, but the usefulness of this technique is limited by false LOR and the inability to reliably detect intravascular or subarachnoid needle placement. In this study, we present a novel epidural needle that allows for the acquisition of optical reflectance spectra from tissue close to the <b>beveled</b> <b>surface.</b> This needle has optical fibers embedded in the cannula that deliver and receive light. With two spectrometers, light received from tissue is resolved across the wavelength range of 500 to 1600 nm. To determine the feasibility of optical tissue differentiation, spectra were acquired from porcine tissues during a post mortem laminectomy. The spectra were processed with an algorithm that derives estimates of the hemoglobin and lipid concentrations.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{differential}} strain across two major fault strands within the Lake Tahoe basin has been mapped using a novel combination of high resolution seismic CHIRP, multibeam swath bathymetry, and airborne laser altimetry. Identification of submerged paleo-shorelines of late Pleistocene to early Holocene age allows this past excursion of lake-level {{to be used}} as a strain marker to evaluate the seismic hazard of the region. Tectonic disruption of this <b>beveled</b> <b>surface</b> (present depth, 11 - 26 meters) has resulted in 9 - 14 meters of discordance from east to west, and 6 to 7 meters of northward tilt along the eastern shore. The mechanism for lake draw-down, once thought to be prolonged drought, is revealed in seismic images that show a large outflow channel cross-cutting the lake 2 ̆ 7 s natural sill, suggesting catastrophic failure. Tectonic uplift and sub-aerial landslides within the Truckee canyon are likely mechanisms that stranded and in-filled this channel allowing Lake Tahoe to rise to modern levels. ROV observations confirm the origin of wave-cut paleo-shorelines, and show extensive moraine deposits to a depth of approximately 40 ft, indicating active erosion within this interval during Tenaya/Tioga times...|$|E

40|$|To {{assess whether}} the {{postural}} function is impaired {{by comparing the}} performances in upright standing at ground and bevel levels in adult subjects with spina bifida occulta (SBO). Eighty subjects with SBO (38 with minor type and 42 with major type) and 35 healthy control subjects participated in the study. All participants performed ten tests while standing upright on a platform at ground level (0 °, baseline) and on a <b>beveled</b> <b>surface</b> (with their feet in dorsiflexion and plantarflexion at 10 ° and 20 °). Tests were done with their eyes open and closed. The postural sway was examined using a force platform (CATSYS, Danish) that records sway intensity and velocity. Sway intensity and sway velocity were universally associated with group, degree of bevel, open- or closed-eyes condition, and dorsiflexion or plantarflexion after adjusting for age and gender. With respect to sway intensity, the differences of minor or major SBO group were significantly decreased at different bevel degrees when compared with control groups, whereas the differences between minor and major SBO were significant differences at 10 ° and 20 °. With respect to sway velocity, the differences of major SBO group were significantly decreased at different bevel degrees when compared with minor SBO and control groups, whereas the difference in minor SBO was only significant at 0 ° when compared with control. Group differences (minor SBO vs. control, major SBO vs. control) showed {{a significant decrease in}} sway velocity when comparing at 10 ° than at 0 ° and at 20 ° than at 0 °. In all subjects with SBO, the sway intensity/velocity values obtained with open eyes and with plantarflexion had lower values, when compared with values obtained with closed eyes and with dorsiflexion. This study supports the hypothesis that SBO impairs control of postural sway in both the resting upright and stressful postures. Our results imply that the larger the bone defect at the lumbosacral midline, the more the group differences in different stressful conditions. Both velocity and intensity were able to reflect the function of the postural sway from our results. This is the first report to add the bevel degree and foot position, as well as visual input as being the part of the study in investigating the postural sway...|$|E
