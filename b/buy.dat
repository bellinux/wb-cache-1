40|$|Previous {{researchers}} {{that have}} employed Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in modeling online <b>buying</b> behavior, validated that consumers&rsquo; attitude towards online <b>buying</b> is mainly determined by two salient beliefs: perceived usefulness of online <b>buying</b> and perceived ease of <b>buying</b> online. This paper {{takes a different}} approach from previous studies and postulates {{that the relationship between}} ease of <b>buying</b> online and attitude will be moderated by consumers&rsquo; perceived self-efficacy. The results of a PLS-based structural equation modeling analysis validatethis assumption, indicating a negative path coefficient for the moderating effect. This means that the direct effect of perceived ease of <b>buying</b> online on attitude will decrease as consumers gain more skills and knowledge about online <b>buying</b> and thus, they perceive an increased selfefficacy. The results of this study implies that consumers&rsquo; salient beliefs of online <b>buying</b> must be rethought since perceived ease of <b>buying</b> is losing its importance in determining consumers&rsquo; attitude for those highly experienced online buyers.

40|$|Impulse <b>buying</b> is a {{phenomenon}} that has attracted attention from marketers and consumer researchers for decades. Whilst impulse <b>buying</b> has been studied extensively, there is a gap {{in our understanding of}} consumer impulse <b>buying</b> choice in different consumption situations. Impulse <b>buying</b> research lacks a theoretical and systematic approach in examining and integrating situational variables. This thesis aims to examine consumer impulse <b>buying</b> choice in various situations simultaneously through the identification of both external and individual determinants of impulse <b>buying</b> behaviour in each situation. This thesis adopts the view of radical behaviourism and the behaviour perspective model (BPM). Radical behaviourism views impulse <b>buying</b> as a behavioural pattern shaped by its contingencies, and the BPM provides a theoretical model which generates the influences of both external and individual-related factors and investigates the interactions between the determinants of impulse <b>buying</b> from the pre-purchase to the post-purchase stage. The BPM matrix also provides a systematic framework to examine consumer impulse <b>buying</b> choice in various consumption situations. A questionnaire was developed based on the BPM with a pre-study interview used as a complementary method. The survey collected data from 414 consumers in the UK and Taiwan. The results show that impulse <b>buying</b> behaviour is shaped by its contingencies {{and the ways in which}} the BPM components influence impulse <b>buying</b> behaviour vary significantly in different situations. The routine shopping situation and its utilitarian reinforcements trigger the highest rate of impulse <b>buying</b> choice. Secondly, the results demonstrate the interactions between the consumption situations and their corresponding individual-related factors, which illustrate the different types of impulse <b>buying</b> behavioural patterns. Thirdly, post-purchase regret was not necessarily found as the punishment that reduces impulse <b>buying</b> behaviour but an indicator of individuals’ impulse <b>buying</b> patterns. Finally, individuals’ cultural backgrounds were also found to predict different types of impulse <b>buying</b> patterns effectively. As the first study to investigate consumer impulse <b>buying</b> choice in different situations, this study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence of situational influences and cultural differences. In addition, this study complements existing impulse <b>buying</b> knowledge by adopting a behavioural perspective. This research also offers managerial implications for international marketers and consumer policy makers on the ways in which impulse <b>buying</b> behaviour may be encouraged or controlled. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Consumers often act impulsively {{when making}} {{internet}} purchases. Triggered by {{easy access to}} products, lack of social pressure, and absence of delivery impediments, impulse <b>buying</b> frequently occurs {{in the context of}} internet shop-ping. This study tests the structural equation model of the impulse <b>buying</b> process for fashion products when internet shopping and examines impulse <b>buying</b> process differences between Korean and Chinese consumers. A total of 985 usable questionnaires were obtained from college students. Data were analyzed by structural equation model analysis using a correlation matrix with a maximum likelihood by AMOS 21. 0. Results showed that increased internet browsing by con-sumers resulted in more impulse <b>buying</b> as mediated by the urge to buy; in addition, more impulse <b>buying</b> by consumers resulted in a higher consumer satisfaction experience. Pure impulse <b>buying</b> created more important antecedents of sat-isfaction than the promotion-oriented impulse <b>buying.</b> Impulse <b>buying</b> showed a high similarity between Korean and Chi-nese consumers; however, increased influence from promotion activities resulted in more fashion product impulse <b>buying</b> for Chinese consumers versus Korean consumers. We confirm that one of the outcomes of the impulse <b>buying</b> process is impulse <b>buying</b> product satisfaction. Korean and Chinese consumers also present similarities and differences in fashion product impulse <b>buying.</b> A managerial implication is discussed for retailers of fashion products to develop strategies to increase consumer browsing and subsequently trigger impulse <b>buying</b> accompanied with consumer satisfaction.
