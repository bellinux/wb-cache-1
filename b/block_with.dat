5|$|As constructed, {{the main}} {{facade of the}} station faced Glenwood Avenue. The two-story {{entrance}} loggia consisted of seven arched bays, with a three-bay wing to the northeast and a two-bay wing to the southwest, and acted as a transition point between {{the street and the}} station interior. The first floor (at track level) featured a large waiting room occupying the entire center <b>block,</b> <b>with</b> vault lights providing natural illumination and a fountain set into the western wall. Restrooms, a kitchen, and a cafe occupied the wings.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  7, there are 15 blocks misclassified. Among them, the <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> nos. 1 – 8, which are should be serious damage, are misclassified as {{moderate}} damage, and the <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> nos. 9 – 12 are misclassified as slight damage, which are should be moderate damage, and the <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> nos. 13 – 15, which are should be slight damage, are misclassified as moderate damage. In general, the damage levels of <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> nos. 1 – 12 are underestimated, while the damage levels of <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> nos. 13 – 15 are overestimated. For {{most of the}} misclassified blocks, their damage levels are underestimated, which indicates the oriented buildings are overestimated using the proposed method and the oriented buildings overestimated are mainly the remaining oriented walls of the collapsed buildings.|$|R

5|$|As soon as Fremantle Prison {{came under}} local control in 1886, a {{refractory}} <b>block</b> <b>with</b> gallows was planned. It {{was completed in}} 1888, and first used in 1889 to execute a convicted murderer, Jimmy Long, a Malayan. The gallows room was the only lawful place of execution in Western Australia between 1888 and 1984. At least 43 men and one woman were hanged in this period. Martha Rendell {{was the only woman}} to be hanged at the prison, in 1909. The last person to be hanged was serial killer Eric Edgar Cooke, executed in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1857 and 1859, the {{hospital}} was a crucial component of Fremantle Prison. Public works during the convict era relied on convict labour, which could only be provided if the convicts were healthy. From 1886 to 1903, medical services were relocated to the main cell <b>block,</b> <b>with</b> the former building used to keep invalids and female prisoners. The hospital was refurbished and reopened in 1904. It subsequently remained in continuous operation until the prison's closure in 1991.|$|E

The office building was leased to the city for use as its first City Hall, library, jail and municipal courts.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to evaluate effects of drinking water treatment sludge on crop quality. In this trial Zea mays L. (pioneer 32 w 86) was used, and the {{research was}} planned according to random <b>blocks</b> sampling design <b>with</b> three replicates. Increased amount of sludge, as of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 t da- 1, was applied on blocks. Zea mays L. seeds were sewed between rows within a distance of 65 cm, and on rows within a distance of 25 cm. Blocks were irrigated to stimulate germination during dry conditions. When the numbers of leaves were reached 8, 10 kg da- 1 of N fertilizer was applied. Plant length, first corncob height, corncob length, corncob diameter and number of corncob were observed and measured using randomly selected 10 plants from each block. As a result, the highest plant length, 206. 97 cm, was found on blocks of control. The lowest plant length 189. 76 cm was found on <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> 1 t da- 1. The highest first corncob height, 85. 62 cm, was found on <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> 1 t da- 1 sludge applied. The lowest first corncob height, 82. 09 cm, was found on <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> 4 t da- 1 sludge applied. Average of the highest corncob number 1. 23 was found on <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> 4 t da- 1 sludge applied. Average of the lowest corncob number 1. 03 was found on <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> 1 t da- 1 sludge applied. The highest corncob length 22. 08 cm was found on <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> 2 t da- 1 sludge applied.

50|$|A 2016 study {{commissioned}} by the Transportation Research Board conducted a comprehensive longitudinal analysis of census block groups in Chicago. Block groups were categorized in one of 3 categories: <b>block</b> groups <b>with</b> bike lanes installed, <b>block</b> groups <b>with</b> sharrows only, and <b>block</b> groups <b>with</b> no cycling infrastructure. The authors found that <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> bike lanes experienced a significantly larger increase in bicycle commuters than <b>block</b> groups <b>with</b> sharrows, which were only a bit better than those without infrastructure. <b>Block</b> groups <b>with</b> only sharrows installed were significantly less effective at reducing injuries per year per commuter than both <b>block</b> groups <b>with</b> bike lanes and even as <b>block</b> groups <b>with</b> no infrastructure. The study concludes that these findings raise concerns {{on the effectiveness of}} sharrows as a safety measure and as an incentive to bicycle commuting.In the discussion on this study it was criticized that block groups were compared instead of streets.|$|R

5|$|Situated between Somerset Road and Devonshire Road, Group 2 Architects {{designed}} the PUB Building as an H-shaped <b>block</b> <b>with</b> a central service core and a naturally-ventilated lobby. Facing north and south, the two parallel wings are of unequal height, and are linked by a wider transverse area three floors in height, and further {{up by the}} lift shaft and the access to each floor.

The lobby extends completely through the <b>block,</b> <b>with</b> a giant entrance hall at Monroe Street and a 16-story full-height atrium in the link between the AT and USG towers (also designed by Smith) as both towers share a common appearance. The building boasts two public lobbies and a mezzanine-level lobby. The lobbies are among the most lavish in Chicago, and they are all decorated with patterned marble floors and walls, bronze, gold-leaf oak trim, and stylized lighting fixtures.|$|E
50|$|There are {{different}} kinds of blocks in the game such as gem <b>blocks,</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> point values attached, explosive blocks that detonate on contact, vanishing blocks that disappear when struck, wood blocks, and steel blocks. Just as the type of <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> which the player must contend changes as the player progresses, so do the tactics for completing the level. The player might have to avoid letting <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> negative point values attached fall while destroying <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> positive point values attached. In another level, the player might have to set off a series of explosions and domino reactions that target a structure's weak point or ricochet shots off multiple structures in order to destroy the <b>blocks,</b> all <b>with</b> {{a limited number of}} projectiles. Different types of blocks possess different physical properties; their mass and the amount of friction they exert alter the way they will respond to contact.|$|R

5|$|Catastrophic {{injuries}} {{have been}} on a steady decline since the 1960s, due in part to rules banning dangerous forms of contact such as spearing, face tackling and butt blocking. However, catastrophic injuries are still caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, as well when players hit their heads against an opposing player's knee or the ground. Returning to play after sustaining a head injury earlier in the game also places players at risk for an even more severe injury. Many states are requiring teams to prevent players who have shown any signs of a concussion from returning to a game, while other steps such as more aggressive enforcement of safety rules and better condition of the neck muscles have been suggested. Additionally, coaches are being urged to train players to <b>block</b> <b>with</b> their shoulders instead of their heads.|$|E
5|$|In February 1976, Koubek {{contributed a}} third {{high-rise}} office building to Farragut Square, {{this one a}} brick-and-solarized glass structure with a glass-and-aluminum penthouse at 818 Connecticut Avenue NW. His massive, grid-like 400 North Capitol Street, {{one of the few}} office buildings he designed with a plaza between two wings, opened in June. His 12-story International Square building—with its inverted setbacks above the Farragut West Washington Metro station, ninth-floor balcony with non-structural columns, interior atrium, and ground level set-back retail concourse—opened in November. Originally just a single office building on a corner for a city block, it expanded to occupy nearly the entire <b>block</b> <b>with</b> the addition of two almost identical towers in 1979 and 1980. (The atrium was upgraded and a fountain added in 1992.) Two blocks to the west, in April 1977 Koubek also designed a fairly nondescript office building at 1990 K Street NW.|$|E
30|$|Since DCT can {{depict the}} {{periodic}} signals very well, {{we use the}} AC energy of DCT coefficients to classify image blocks into three morphological components, i.e., smooth, texture, and contour. For the same block size, the image <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> smooth component have the minimum AC energy followed by the image <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> texture component and the image <b>blocks</b> <b>with</b> contour component. Experimental results have shown the robustness of our proposed algorithm to noise. Also, our proposed algorithm can achieve better denoising results than both BM 3 D and BM 3 D-SAPCA, in terms of PSNR and MSSIM values as well as visual inspection.|$|R

5|$|The Ford Cosworth DFV was {{produced}} by Cosworth in Northampton and {{had been used in}} Formula One since 1967. It is a 2,993cc (183cu in) normally aspirated four-stroke engine with two banks of four cylinders at 90degrees to each other in a 'V8' configuration. It has an aluminium alloy engine <b>block</b> <b>with</b> cylinder liners. Each of its crossflow cylinder heads has a single spark plug and four valves, activated by gear-driven double overhead camshafts. This, combined with the flat-plane crankshaft, provides a relatively simple exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block. The engine is water-cooled, with water and oil radiators mounted in the left and right sidepods respectively. In 1980, a revised version of the DFV was introduced in which ancillaries such as the water and oil pumps were reduced in size and grouped further forwards on the flanks of the engine to provide more clearance for ground effect tunnels under the cars.|$|E
