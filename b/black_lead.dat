5|$|As well as copper, a new {{substance}} was found, extracted and exploited: this was variously called wad, <b>black</b> <b>lead,</b> plumbago or black cauke, {{and is now}} known as graphite. Many uses were quickly discovered for the mineral: it reduced friction in machinery, made a heat-resistant glaze for crucibles, and when used to line moulds for cannonballs, resulted in rounder, smoother balls that could be fired further by English naval cannon. Later, from {{the second half of the}} 18th century, it was used to make pencils, for which Keswick became famous.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{relationship}} with the skinheads varied at times. Barson was particularly displeased with the band's skinhead association, often finding it disappointing that so many were present at performances. Before becoming a full member of the band, Chas Smash {{had been involved in}} fights with skinheads at performances. In one incident on 18 November 1979, Madness were supported by Red Beans and Rice, who featured a <b>black</b> <b>lead</b> singer, and the band was prevented from completing the performance due to the racist chants from certain members of the skinhead-filled audience. Suggs later came on stage to show his displeasure at their behaviour, but this did not stop much of the audience from Nazi saluting {{at the end of the}} show.|$|E

5|$|Failing to {{find another}} job at a news agency, he met {{producer}} Allan Burns at a party. Burns got him a job on My Mother the Car where he was hired to rewrite a script after pitching some story ideas. Brooks {{then went on to}} write episodes of That Girl, The Andy Griffith Show and My Three Sons before Sheldon Leonard hired him as a story editor on My Friend Tony. In 1969 he created for ABC the series Room 222, which lasted until 1974. Room 222 was the second series in American history to feature a <b>black</b> <b>lead</b> character, in this case high school teacher Pete Dixon played by Lloyd Haynes. The network felt the show was sensitive and so attempted to change the pilot story so that Dixon helped a white student rather than a black one, but Brooks prevented it. On the show Brooks worked with Gene Reynolds who taught him the importance of extensive and diligent research, which he conducted at Los Angeles High School for Room 222, and he used the technique on his subsequent works. Brooks left Room 222 as head writer after one year to work on other pilots and brought Burns in to produce the show.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{graphite}} {{was called}} <b>black</b> <b>lead</b> or plumbago. Plumbago was {{commonly used in}} its massive mineral form. Both of these names arise from confusion with the similar-appearing lead ores, particularly galena.

2500|$|E.N.V.'s V-8 engines {{appeared}} in six different models. [...] Most {{of these were}} identified by a letter, though contemporary sources often refer to them by power. [...] The assignment of the letters C, D, F and T is known from contemporary sources. The one type known to have pre-dated the C has been assigned the letter A by a later historian, a notation followed here. [...] The last engine is usually known as the 1914 100hp E.N.V. [...] The physical details of all the engines, such as bore and stroke etc. are known from both contemporary records and surviving examples. [...] There were also variations within types, as development proceeded. Nonetheless, all the V-8s had much in common. [...] They all had their cylinder banks separated by 90°, leaving space within the V for inlet manifolds and valvegear. [...] All were water-cooled; each cylinder was enclosed with an electrolytically formed copper jacket. Initially these were produced with {{a variant of the}} lost wax process. [...] The cylinders were coated with wax, which was then coated with <b>black</b> <b>lead</b> to make it electrically conductive and copper plated. [...] Afterwards the wax was removed by heating. [...] Later, the insulating wax was replaced with electrically conducting, low melting point white metal, simplifying the process. [...] Pistons were made of steel, with cast iron rings, and the crankcases were cast aluminium. [...] There was one plug per cylinder, supplied by a gear-driven magneto alone or with an additional battery-driven ignition coil and distributor for dual ignition.|$|E

60|$|With {{the note}} {{was a very}} fine steel saw, coiled round and round, and a tiny phial of oil. Ryan gave a cry of delight as he read it; and then hid the saw and the oil bottle in his bed, made up the tiny note into a pellet, and {{swallowed}} it. As he ate his dinner, he pondered over how so much could have been managed. The courtyard of the prison was, he knew, some ten feet higher than the ground outside. Some one must, after nightfall, have climbed up to the passage window and sawn the bars almost asunder, with a saw as fine as {{the one he had}} received. The cuts could hardly have been perceptible, and had probably been filled in with dust or <b>black</b> <b>lead,</b> each night, after the work was done. The difficulty must have been great, for he had learned that sentries patrolled the street outside the prison, and the work could only have been carried on for two or three minutes at a time.

60|$|Our Christmas {{dinner was}} a good one, in a {{substantial}} point of view; and a very pleasant one, in a social point of view. We ate it in the winter mess-room; and really (for Hudson Bay) this was quite a snug and highly decorated apartment. True, there was no carpet on the floor, and the chairs were home-made; but then the table was mahogany, and the walls were hung round with several large engravings in bird's-eye maple frames. The stove, too, was brightly polished with <b>black</b> <b>lead,</b> and the painting of the room had been executed {{with a view to}} striking dumb those innocent individuals who had spent the greater part of their lives at outposts, and were, consequently, accustomed to domiciles and furniture of the simplest and most unornamental description. On the present grand occasion the mess-room was illuminated by an argand lamp, and the table covered with a snow-white cloth, whereon reposed a platter containing a beautiful, fat, plump wild-goose, which had a sort of come-eat-me-up-quick-else-I'll-melt expression about it that was painfully delicious. Opposite to this smoked a huge roast of beef, to procure which one of our most useless draught oxen had been sacrificed. This, with a dozen of white partridges, and a large piece of salt pork, composed our dinner. But the greatest rarities on the board were two large decanters of port wine, and two smaller ones of Madeira. These were flanked by tumblers and glasses; and truly, upon the whole, our dinner made a goodly show.|$|E
6000|$|I entered {{upon the}} {{execution}} of this plan for self-examination, and continued it, with occasional intermissions, for some time. I {{was surprised to find}} myself so much fuller of faults than I had imagined; but I had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish. To avoid the trouble of renewing now and then my little book, which, by scraping out the marks on the paper of old faults to make room for new ones in a new course, became full of holes, I transferred my tables and precepts to the ivory leaves of a memorandum book, on which the lines were drawn with red ink, that made a durable stain; and on those lines I marked my faults with a <b>black</b> <b>lead</b> pencil; which marks I could easily wipe out with a wet sponge. After a while I went through one course only in a year; and afterward only one in several years; till at length I omitted them entirely, being employed in voyages and business abroad, with a multiplicity of affairs that interfered; but I always carried my little book with me. My scheme of Order gave me the most trouble; and I found that though it might be practicable where a man's business was such as to leave him the disposition of his time, that of a journeyman-printer, for instance, {{it was not possible to}} be exactly observed by a master, who must mix with the world, and often receive people of business at their own hours. Order, too, with regard to places for things, papers, &c., I found it extremely difficult to acquire. I had not been early accustomed to method, and having an exceeding good memory, I was not so sensible of the inconvenience attending want of method. This article, therefore, cost me much painful attention, and my faults in it vexed me so much, and I made so little progress in amendment, and had such frequent relapses, that I was almost ready to give up the attempt, and content myself with a faulty character in that respect. Like the man who, in buying an axe of a smith my neighbour, desired to have the whole of its surface as bright as the edge, the smith consented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel: he turned while the smith pressed the broad face of the axe hard and heavily on the stone, which made the turning of it very fatiguing. The man came every now and then from the wheel to see how the work went on; and at length would take his axe as it was, without farther grinding. [...] "No," [...] said the smith, [...] "turn on, we shall have it bright by-and-by; as yet 'tis only speckled." [...] "Yes," [...] said the man, [...] "but I think I like a speckled axe best." [...] And I believe this may have been the case with many, who having, for the want of some such means as I employed, found the difficulty of obtaining good and breaking bad habits in other points of vice and virtue, have given up the struggle, and concluded that [...] "a speckled axe was best." [...] For something that pretended to be reason was every now and then suggesting to me, that such extreme nicety as I exacted of myself, might be a kind of foppery in morals, which, if it were known, would make me ridiculous; that a perfect character might be attended with the inconvenience of being envied and hated; and that a benevolent man should allow a few faults in himself, to keep his friends in countenance. In truth, I found myself incorrigible with respect to Order; and, now I am grown old and my memory bad, I feel very sensibly the want of it. But, on the whole, though I never arrived at the perfection I had been so ambitious of obtaining, but fell far short of it, yet I was, by the endeavour, a better and a happier man than I otherwise should have been if I had not attempted it; as those who aim at perfect writing by imitating the engraved copies, though they may never reach the wished-for excellence of those copies, their hand is mended by the endeavour, and is tolerable while it continues fair and legible.|$|E
