A new computational approach for quantitatively calculating free volumes (FVs) in structural models is developed, based {{on which the}} manner in which FVs contribute to deformation is studied. It is found that FVs have different expansion <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> terms of their saturation sizes and corresponding strain values, which are essential structural causes of different yield <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> these two deformations in metallic glasses...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} the prevalence of violence su-ffered, drug use and risk <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> homosexual and bisexual in-dividuals. Method: Cross-sectional, quantitative study involving 296 Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual individuals in the municipalities of Crato and Juazeiro do Norte, South of Ceará state, Brazil. Findings: Psychological/verbal abuse is the most prevalent and de-pressants of {{the central nervous system}} are chosen for consumption after victimization. Depressant and stimulant drugs were associated to dependence and risk <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> sexual minorities. Conclusion: Gay and bisexual people use drugs after suffering vio-lence, with an association between drug use and developing risk behaviors. Further investigations inherent in these associations are necessary, since other factors may interact to violence, drug use and risk <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> sexual minorities.

5|$|Ethology is {{the study}} of animal {{behavior}} (particularly that of social animals such as primates and canids), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of <b>behavior</b> <b>in</b> terms of the theory of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, influenced many ethologists to come.|$|E
5|$|He {{also carried}} out studies on {{education}} and on human <b>behavior,</b> <b>in</b> a social-science tradition. Some of his views and theories made him a precursor of evolutionism in the natural and social sciences. In his essays on human nature, he declared for the primacy of science and was relatively critical {{of the influence of}} religion. These views gained him some critics, as he was seen as a priest who had abandoned religion.|$|E
40|$|Although ingratiatory {{behaviors}} {{have been}} investigated by social psychologists for almost twenty-five years, and have been discussed as being used in organizational settings as an upward influence strategy, few empirical studies have explored the use of ingratiation in organizations. The intent of this study has been to empirically investigate the use of ingratiatory <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> organizational settings. In doing so, a theory-based rationale for the occurrence of ingratiatory <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> organizational settings was developed. The framework developed for this study examined ingratiation as both an individually initiated and organizationally induced behavior. Next, a scale was developed to measure {{the frequency with which}} employees resort to ingratiatory <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> relationships with their superiors. Finally, a series of research propositions about the occurrence of ingratiatory <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> organizations were tested across a variety of organizational settings...|$|R
