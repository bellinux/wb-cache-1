With the announcement of Apple's Game Center, Lou Fasulo, SVP, pivoted the company to its current business of creating highly social freemium games for mobile. The company's first game was Trade Nations, a city building simulation, which achieved critical acclaim as well as viral success within its first few months on the iOS platform. Following the initial success of Trade Nations, the company received additional investment from Seattle's Madrona Venture Group as well as Draper Fisher Jurvetson. The company's next game, MetalStorm, brought the freemium model to aerial combat flight simulators while also earning acclaim for its integration of AirPlay mirroring. Following MetalStorm, the company released its third iOS title Battle Nations which combined city <b>building</b> <b>mechanics</b> with strategy-based PvP.

The history of the {{establishment}} goes back to 1946, when the first woman irrigator T.A. Kolpakova opened the Building of Small and Medium Hydroelectric-Stations faculty. After some years the faculty was called as the Hydro Technical Building. However, big changes to the faculty came in the independence years of Uzbekistan. In 1991 the faculty was considered to be as the department due to the changes in infrastructure.

He compared the graphics to [...] "a poor man's Wii Sports resort" [...] and said the planes looked like small wooden toys with the best compliment he could give the game was; [...] "who knows if the aerodynamic knowledge players learn from SimplePlanes can actually transfer over into the real world?

Ben Schwan, a writer for the German website Heise Online also criticised the <b>building</b> <b>mechanics.</b> [...] Mark Steighner, a writer for Hardcore Gamer did not criticise the controls but instead commented on the lack of charisma that games like Kerbal Space Program have.
