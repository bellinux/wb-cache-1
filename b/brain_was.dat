5|$|In 2004, {{scientists}} analysing {{a detailed}} CT {{scan of the}} braincase of the London Archaeopteryx concluded that its <b>brain</b> <b>was</b> significantly larger than that of most dinosaurs, indicating that it possessed the brain size necessary for flying. The overall brain anatomy was reconstructed using the scan. The reconstruction showed that the regions associated with vision took up nearly one-third of the brain. Other well-developed areas involved hearing and muscle coordination. The skull scan also revealed the structure of its inner ear. The structure more closely resembles that of modern birds than the inner ear of non-avian reptiles. These characteristics taken together suggest that Archaeopteryx had the keen sense of hearing, balance, spatial perception, and coordination needed to fly. Archaeopteryx had a cerebrum-to-brain-volume ratio 78% {{of the way to}} modern birds from the condition of non-coelurosaurian dinosaurs such as Carcharodontosaurus or Allosaurus, which had a crocodile-like anatomy of the brain and inner ear. Newer research shows that while the Archaeopteryx <b>brain</b> <b>was</b> more complex than that of more primitive theropods, it had a more generalized brain volume among maniraptoran dinosaurs, even smaller than that of other non-avian dinosaurs in several instances, which indicates the neurological development required for flight was already a common trait in the maniraptoran clade.|$|E

5|$|The {{brain of}} Deinocheirus was reconstructed through CT scans and {{presented}} at the 2014 Society of Vertebrate Palaeontology conference. The <b>brain</b> <b>was</b> globular and similar in shape to that of birds and troodontid theropods, the cerebrum was expanded in a way similar to most theropods, and the olfactory tracts were relatively large. The <b>brain</b> <b>was</b> proportionally small and compact, and its Reptile Encephalisation Quotient (brain-body ratio) was estimated at 0.69, which is low for theropods, and similar to sauropods. Other ornithomimosaurs have proportionally large brains, and the small brain of Deinocheirus may reflect its social behaviour or diet. Its coordination and balance {{would not have been}} as important as for carnivorous theropods. A bone microstructure study {{presented at the}} 13th Annual Meeting of the European Association of Vertebrate Palaeontologists in 2015 showed that Deinocheirus probably had a high metabolic rate, and grew rapidly before reaching sexual maturity.|$|E

5|$|After the war, <b>Brain</b> <b>was</b> {{appointed}} Qantas' Assistant General Manager. Fysh {{was still}} in his early fifties and appeared unlikely to retire any time soon. Seeing little chance of further advancement where he was, Brain took the opportunity to apply for the position of Operations Manager at Trans Australia Airlines (TAA), a new domestic carrier established by the Federal Labor government and run by the Australian National Airlines Commission (ACAC), which was chaired by Arthur Coles. Qantas could not match the £2,250 salary associated with the TAA role, and Brain advised Fysh of his resignation on 10April 1946. In the event, ACAC appointed him TAA's General Manager on 3June, with a £3,000 salary and an undertaking to increase this to as much as £5,000 in the future.|$|E

5|$|Bertie the <b>Brain</b> <b>was</b> {{an early}} {{computer}} game, {{and one of}} the first games developed in the early history of video games. It was built in Toronto by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. The four meter tall computer allowed exhibition attendees to play a game of tic-tac-toe against an artificial intelligence. The player entered a move on a lit keypad in the form of a three-by-three grid, and the game played out on a grid of lights overhead. The machine had an adjustable difficulty level. After two weeks on display by Rogers Majestic, the machine was disassembled at the end of the exhibition and largely forgotten as a curiosity.|$|E
5|$|Born in Forbes, New South Wales, on 27February 1903, Lester <b>Brain</b> <b>was</b> {{the second}} {{son of an}} English mining {{engineer}} and manager, Austin Brain, and his Australian wife, Katie. Originally from Gloucestershire, Austin had emigrated with his parents and siblings in 1885, prospecting for gold in the United States before settling in Australia. By the age of thirteen, Lester owned his own motorcycle bought secondhand for £11; its poor condition and constant need for repair helped him become mechanically adept at an early age. He completed his education at Sydney Grammar School, where he excelled in maths, before being employed by the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney (CBC) in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Computed tomography, {{also known}} as CT scanning, of a {{complete}} Majungasaurus skull (FMNH PR 2100) allowed a rough reconstruction of its brain and inner ear structure. Overall, the <b>brain</b> <b>was</b> very small relative to body size, but otherwise similar to many other non-coelurosaurian theropods, with a very conservative form closer to modern crocodilians than to birds. One difference between Majungasaurus and other theropods was its smaller flocculus, a region of the cerebellum that helps to coordinate movements of the eye with movements of the head. This suggests that Majungasaurus and other abelisaurids like Indosaurus, which also had a small flocculus, did not rely on quick head movements to sight and capture prey.|$|E
50|$|This {{would suggest}} that {{just one part of}} the <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> not {{responsible}} for memory and localization was totally ruled out. What they concluded was that multiple parts of the brain work together for memory and retention. They also found that rats with lesions in a small specific area had functioning sensory systems and it seemed that when parts of the <b>brain</b> <b>were</b> damaged for a certain action, other parts of the <b>brain</b> <b>were</b> compensating so those actions could be carried out. Lashley coined the term equipotentiality to define the idea that if one part of the <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> damaged, other parts of the brain will carry out the memory functions for that damaged part.|$|R

5|$|On 4 July 1902 (the {{day of his}} death) Vivekananda awoke early, went to {{the monastery}} at Belur Math and meditated for three hours. He taught Shukla-Yajur-Veda, Sanskrit grammar and the {{philosophy}} of yoga to pupils, later discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math. At 7:00p.m. Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; he died at 9:10p.m. while meditating. According to his disciples, Vivekananda attained mahasamādhi; the rupture of a blood vessel in his <b>brain</b> <b>was</b> reported as a possible cause of death. His disciples believed that the rupture was due to his brahmarandhra (an opening in the crown of his head) being pierced when he attained mahasamādhi. Vivekananda fulfilled his prophecy {{that he would not}} live forty years. He was cremated on a sandalwood funeral pyre {{on the bank of the}} Ganga in Belur, opposite where Ramakrishna was cremated sixteen years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Skeletal {{elements}} of the upper jaw {{appear to have been}} rhynchokinetic (movable in relation to each other), which must have affected its feeding behaviour. In extant birds, such as frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons, kinetic premaxillae help with consuming large food items. The beak also appears {{to have been able to}} withstand high force loads, which indicates a diet of hard food. In 2016, the first 3D endocast was made from the brain of the dodo; examination found that though the <b>brain</b> <b>was</b> similar to that of other pigeons in most respects, the dodo had a comparatively large olfactory bulb. This gave the dodo a good sense of smell, which may have aided in locating fruit and small prey.|$|E
5|$|The <b>brain</b> <b>was</b> {{slightly}} sigmoidal (S-shaped), {{without much}} {{expansion of the}} cerebral hemispheres, more like a crocodile than a bird. This {{is in keeping with}} the overall conservatism of non-coelurosaurian theropod brains. Acrocanthosaurus had large and bulbous olfactory bulbs, indicating a good sense of smell. Reconstructing the semicircular canals of the ear, which control balance, shows that the head was held at a 25° angle below horizontal. This was determined by orienting the endocast so that the lateral semicircular canal was parallel to the ground, as it usually is when an animal is in an alert posture.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{research into}} thinking machines {{was inspired by}} a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 30s, 40s and early 50s.

Norbert Wiener's cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks. Claude Shannon's information theory described digital signals (i.e., all-or-nothing signals).

5|$|Gerald Fischbach {{spent nine}} {{years at the}} Washington University School of Medicine, where he served as the Edison Professor of Neurobiology and Head of the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology. During his time here, Fischbach {{continued}} {{his work on the}} ARIA protein. When ARIA isolated from chick embryo <b>brain</b> <b>was</b> applied to chicken myotubes, which are developing chicken muscle fibers, it was shown to increase the rate of insertion of acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes. This indicated ARIA could play a role in acetylcholine receptor insertion in neuromuscular junctions. Additionally, it was demonstrated that ARIA stimulated the transcription of α acetylcholine receptor subunits leading to an increase in α subunit messenger RNA (mRNA) and precursors, but had no effect on the mRNA levels of the γ or δ acetylcholine receptor subunits. This indicated that the amount α acetylcholine receptor subunit limits the synthesis and subsequent insertion of acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes.|$|E
