5|$|Christine {{admits she}} {{is afraid of}} the Phantom and tells Raoul he will never stop trying to {{recapture}} her. Raoul realizes {{that they can use}} the Phantom's opera to capture him, as he will surely attend. Don Juan Triumphant is performed, and the Phantom makes his entrance (having secretly replaced the lead) with Christine. Raoul can do nothing <b>but</b> <b>watch</b> from his box as Christine falls for the Phantom yet again. However, she once again removes his mask, revealing his deformities to the entire audience, who scream in fear. He escapes with her by dropping the chandelier and setting the opera house on fire.|$|E
5|$|After the {{elections}} {{in the fall of}} 1862, Governor Morton feared that the legislature's Democratic majority would attempt to hinder the war effort, reduce his authority, and vote to secede from the Union. After the legislative session convened in 1863, all but four Republican legislators stayed away from Indianapolis to prevent the general assembly from attaining the quorum it needed to pass legislation, including funding the state government or making tax provisions. This rapidly led to a crisis as the state government began to run out of money to conduct its business and was nearly bankrupt. Going beyond his constitutional powers, Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans to avert the crisis. To obtain funds to run the state government, Morton turned to James Lanier, a wealthy banker from Madison, Indiana. On two occasions, Lanier provided the state with more than $1 million (USD) in unsecured loans. Morton's move was successful, he was able to fund the state government and the war effort in Indiana. There was little the legislature could do <b>but</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E

25|$|Berthold {{returned}} to Doctor Bier's clinic, being treated there through early October. Once his pains were alleviated, {{he went home}} to recuperate. He still craved a return to flying combat, but the war ended while he was convalescing. The patriotic ace who had shot down 16 of 44 enemy airplanes while flying one handed could <b>but</b> <b>watch</b> as his beloved fatherland fell into defeat and chaos.|$|E
25|$|During the War of 1812, Key, {{accompanied}} by the British Prisoner Exchange Agent Colonel John Stuart Skinner, dined aboard the British ship HMS Tonnant as the guests of three British officers: Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane, Rear Admiral George Cockburn, and Major General Robert Ross. Skinner and Key were there to negotiate the release of prisoners, {{one of whom was}} Dr.William Beanes, a resident of Upper Marlboro, Maryland, who had been arrested after jailing marauding British troops who were looting local farms. Skinner, Key, and Beanes were not allowed to return to their own sloop because they had become familiar with the strength and position of the British units and with the British intent to attack Baltimore. Thus, Key was unable to do anything <b>but</b> <b>watch</b> the bombarding of the American forces at Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore on the night of September 1314,1814.|$|E
25|$|The War of Saint-Sardos, a short {{conflict}} between Edward and the Kingdom of France, led indirectly to Edward's overthrow. The French monarchy used {{the jurisdiction of}} the Parlement of Paris to overrule decisions of the nobility's courts. As a French vassal, Edward felt this encroachment in Gascony with the French kings adjudicating disputes between him and his French subjects. Without confrontation he could do little <b>but</b> <b>watch</b> the duchy shrink. Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, decided to resist one such judgement in Saint-Sardos with the result that Charles IV declared the duchy forfeit. Charles's sister, Queen Isabella, was sent to negotiate and agreed to a treaty that required Edward to pay homage in France to Charles. Edward resigned Aquitaine and Ponthieu to his son, Prince Edward, who travelled to France to give homage in his stead. With the English heir in her power, Isabella refused to return to England unless Edward II dismissed his favourites and also formed a relationship with Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March. The couple invaded England and, joined by Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, captured the king. Edward II abdicated on the condition that his son would inherit the throne rather than Mortimer. He is generally believed to have been murdered at Berkeley Castle by having a red-hot poker thrust into his bowels. In 1330 a coup by Edward III ended four years of control by Isabella and Mortimer. Mortimer was executed, but although removed from power, Isabella was treated well, living in luxury for the next 27 years.|$|E

500|$|Many readers remain unconvinced by {{the cast}} and crew's justifications, and others note that Faramir was {{rendered}} too much like Boromir and thus {{the contrast between the}} two was severely weakened. A scene that received additional criticism is the Rangers' treatment of Gollum, who is beaten up, and Faramir's implicit compliance. In the book, Faramir calls the creature Sméagol instead of Gollum, and tells his men to [...] "treat him gently, <b>but</b> <b>watch</b> him".|$|E
2500|$|On March 31, 1865, Hunton's Brigade {{was moved}} to near Hatcher's Run outside Petersburg. Hunton's Brigade was {{dispatched}} {{from the rest of}} the division. As it formed for battle, General Robert E. Lee personally oversaw the deployment of the brigade (or so Lieutenant Wood remembered). The brigade was advanced through some woods at the double-quick and drove back a Federal line. General Lee spurred his horse, Traveller, into the midst of the fighting, but the men of the 19th shouted [...] "Don't go with us General, <b>but</b> <b>watch</b> us!" ...|$|E
