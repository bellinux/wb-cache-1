40|$|Graduation date: 2017 This {{research}} investigates shape optimization process, using b-spline {{models and}} panel methods, {{to achieve a}} high lift to drag ratio for an aerodynamic structure. This research is a proof of concept for further research in aerodynamic shape optimization. The coupled process, involving the design and optimization of a random shape, is outlined in three major steps that include {{the construction of a}} clamped-closed <b>b</b> <b>spline</b> <b>curve,</b> locational point data transfer to a panel code analysis, and optimization implementation to refine the solutions. This is an iterative process, one that utilizes a genetic algorithm in which the shape is determined by the b-spline control points. This method is unique in the use of a clamped-closed b-spline curve coupled with a vortex panel method. After many verification tests, the process was considered to be applicable for validation testing to mission specific profiles under more constrains, as it has shown to successfully transform random shapes to attain higher lift to drag ratio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} planning the motions of autonomous vehicles moving on general terrains. The method obtains the geometric path and vehicle speeds that minimize motion time consid- ering vehicle dynamics, terrain topography, obstacles, and surface mobility. The terrain is represented by a smooth cubic B patch, and the geometric path consists of a <b>B</b> <b>spline</b> <b>curve</b> mapped to the surface. The time optimal motions are computed by first obtaining the best ohstacle- free path from all paths represented by a uniform grid. This path is further optimized with a local optimization, using the optimal motion time along the path as the cost function and the control points of a B spline as the optimizing parameters. Examples are presented that demonstrate the method for a simple dynamic model of a vehicle moving on a mountainous terrain. I.

40|$|Ray tracing {{is one of}} the {{photorealistic}} rendering method. Ray tracing {{process takes}} a long time because of the calculation of lighting effects and optical effects caused by the material of the object. The length of rendering time increases with the increasing complexity of the shape of the object, such as a mesh object. To minimize processing time, generally done by reducing the complexity of the mesh, which reduces the number of face that forms a mesh object. How {{to reduce the number of}} face is to combine adjacent face to face. The downside of this method is that the object surface resulting display will look grainy/triangular - facet (checkered). The proposed method in this study aims to refine the visualization of objects that complexity is not high. Triangular surface mesh - terms appear due to the calculation of the same color for each face that form a mesh. If the face has a color gradation, the mesh will look smooth surface. To produce a color gradation on a broad face, normal calculation was used, ie in proportion adopting <b>b</b> - <b>splines</b> <b>curve</b> calculations. Testing is done by comparing the results of the use of normal <b>B</b> - <b>splines</b> to the simple method of subdivision (a method of face vast divide into several smaller face, so that the finer the mesh surface) with ray tracing rendering method. From the experimental results, it can be concluded that the results of ray tracing using <b>b</b> - <b>splines</b> normal when compared with the subdivision, the results are not too different. From the aspect of long rendering process, the more the number of face of a mesh, it also increase the effectiveness of rendering time process.
