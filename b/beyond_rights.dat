It also includes 'stopover' traffic where passengers may embark or disembark at an intermediate stop {{as part of an}} itinerary between the endpoints of a multi-leg flight or connecting flights. Some international flights stop at multiple points in a foreign country and passengers may sometimes make stopovers in a similar manner, but because the traffic being carried does not originate in the country where the flight takes place it is not cabotage but another form of <b>beyond</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|E

40|$|Summary It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that weaknesses in rights and land tenure is one of the important causes of forest-related violence. We go <b>beyond</b> <b>rights</b> and tenure to examine relationships between deforestation, forest-related violence, and multi-scale forest governance in a situation of secure tenure rights in comparative case studies of four communities in two watersheds in Guerrero, Mexico. Multi-scale forest governance influenced different rates of land use/cover change and lethal violence but cattle and human population are also influential. We suggest that weaknesses at the regional level of forest governance can be compensated by strong national and community governance. common property community forest management forest-related violence LUCC analysis Latin America Mexico...|$|E

40|$|Based on biographical interviews, {{this paper}} explores the (non-) {{realization}} of disability-related {{rights in the}} lives of persons with visual and physical impairments in France. Following up on the path opened by Engel and Munger’s Rights of inclusion, I expand the scope of analysis in two ways: by including different types of disability-related rights (not only civil, but also social rights), and by developing a broader perspective on the realization of rights, which also depends on policymaking, <b>beyond</b> <b>rights</b> consciousness. The paper first stresses generational differences in the realization of disability rights, with life trajectories becoming less institutionalized. In the context of rights whose realization yet is frail, it then shows how other structural social inequalities such as gender strongly impact the chances of these rights becoming real...|$|E
40|$|In his paper, Turnbull {{raises an}} {{important}} but often unrecognized point, {{which is that}} there are certain limitations to what rights can do for us. He introduces the notions of "trust" and "compassion" in order to indicate the kind of limitation he has in mind. While I am sympathetic to his general position at this point-there are certain concerns in the ethical domain that cannot be properly addressed by the notion of rights-I think the author owes his readers a more explicit explanantion about what it is that rights cannot do in the particular case he presents us with. Thinking about this case, Turnbull finds himself trapped in a paradox, which leads him to believe he must move <b>beyond</b> <b>rights</b> claims. The paraadox, as he describes it, is that if we stick to rights claims in order to protect people with disabilities against various kinds of discrimination in the context of health care, they might end up in a situation where neither they nor we want them to be.

40|$|Since the High Court’s {{decision}} in Mabo v Queensland (No 2),[1] some commentators have argued that, at common law, recognition of Aboriginal land rights entails recognition of {{other aspects of}} Aboriginal customary law. [2] Indeed, {{although there have been}} a number of post-Mabo decisions refusing to extend recognition of Aboriginal law, on the basis of the Mabo principle, <b>beyond</b> <b>rights</b> and interests in land,[3] there is also judicial support for such an extension: the decision of Mr Gillies SM in Colin James Goodsell v James Galarrwuy Yunupingu[4] falling within the latter category. Aboriginal customary entitlements beyond those relating to land — for example, customs and practices relating to marriage, custody of children and crime and punishment — are undoubtedly as important as land rights from the perspective of the preservation of Aboriginal cultural identity. Nevertheless, the recent Queensland Court of Appeal’s {{decision in}} Jones v Public Trustee of Queensland[5] shows that the independent recognition of Aboriginal customary rights to land in Mabo is in no sense arbitrary: the Court observing that the appellant’s non-land Aboriginal customary law submission ‘appears to be based on a misconception of what was decided by the High Court in [Mabo]. ...|$|E

40|$|Latino {{immigrants}} encounter an entanglement {{of rights}} and policies after occupational injury or illness. In collaboration with an immigrant worker center, ethnographic research and a survey are used to analyze injured workers’ experiences. The center uses survey results to identify common threads and systematic problems, and to explore potential direct action. Through interviews with workers and medical and legal professionals, I investigate the barriers Latino immigrants face following occupational injury or illness, how their lived experiences relate to the greater medicolegal frameworks that demarcate most formal processes of compensation and treatment, and the experiences of professionals who mediate these structures. Research results confirm that immigrant workers lack information about their labor rights and the workers’ compensation system, which prevents them from filing claims, and contributes to the underreporting of workplace injuries. However, this research project also documents how workers who do file claims and report injuries are systematically barred access to redress due to a confluence of factors including unresponsive and fraudulent employers, biases in the medical system, discourses of deservingness, insufficient protections from retaliation, {{and the effects of}} a market-based medical system. I argue that future work-related injury prevention efforts should go <b>beyond</b> <b>rights</b> education, and include reforms to the compensation system...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{development}} and status of the airline industry of Japan and the points of debate in the recent Japan-U. S. airline dispute. Until 1986, international routes were given only to Japan Air Lines, while domestic routes were dominated by All Nippon Airways, with minor shares given to JAL (major routes only) and Japan Air System (local, short-haul routes only). A policy change in 1986 allowed the three airlines to mutually expand into each other's routes. Major deregulation on airfares did not come until 1995 - 96. The original Japan-U. S. treaty of 1952 was "unfair" {{in the sense that}} the U. S. carriers were given more freedom than their Japanese counterparts, especially in "beyond rights. " The amendments of 1982, 1985, and 1989 expanded the routes of Japanese airlines (JAL and new entries of ANA and JAS) as well as those of the new U. S. entrants (American and Delta). However, disputes remain between the two countries over routes, frequencies of flights, and <b>beyond</b> <b>rights.</b> Interestingly, these disputes are not always divided along national boundaries: Carriers with large market shares (JAL, United, Northwest and FEDEX) have an incentive to stall negotiations, while restricted carriers (ANA, Nippon Cargo Airlines, AA, DL, Continental, and UPS) are eager to open negotiations in order to expand their routes...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} about an unusual child custody dispute between {{the parents of a}} six-year-old child and the child welfare {{services}} of Franklin County, Ohio. The conflict emerged when the child’s parents complied with their male child’s professed desire to be treated as a girl by attempting to enroll the child in the first grade as a girl. The paper treats this case as an exemplary test-case of contemporary co-dependence between scientific-medical discourse and liberal-rights discourse. The paper analyzes the positions of {{the two sides of the}} custody dispute according to the classic modern distinction between mind and body. On the one hand, the child’s parents alleged that the child should be treated as a girl, because the child’s ‘true self’ in his/her effeminate mind. On the other hand, the child-welfare services counter-claimed that the child should be treated as a boy, because the child’s ‘true self’ is located in the male body. The paper investigates the ways that each side attempted to justify its position in light of current debates regarding the foundation of ‘gender-identity. ’ In particular, the paper focuses on medical-scientific theories about ‘psychosexual development’ that appeared in the US around mid-century and appeared in this case as legal claims about standards of parenthood such as ‘best interest,’ and parental ‘neglect’ and ‘abuse. ’ The paper then focuses on the potential of liberal rights discourse, and specifically sex discrimination law to free individuals from institutional gender enforcement. The paper agrees that sex discrimination law can often produce satisfactory results, such as granting this child the liberty of free gender expression. However, the paper also critically analyzes sex discrimination law as a discourse that often reflects rather than rejects rigid mental health definitions of modern scientific discourses. In conclusion, the paper points to the limited horizons of rights as a liberating force, and demonstrates the need to think <b>beyond</b> <b>rights</b> in feminist and queer legal theory...|$|E
