40|$|Abstract: Attempts {{were made}} to develop a soft {{beverage}} from paneer whey and guava pulp which pasteurized at different temperatures and timings for estimating its shelf-life. In the preparation of beverages the volume of guava pulp (25 %), sugar (10 %) and paneer whey (65 %) were kept constant while the pasteurization temperatures and timings were varied from 60 °C- 70 °C for 15 - 35 minutes. The prepared beverages were evaluated for their physico- chemical properties and organoleptic qualities every 15 days till 45 days. Effect of different temperatures, timings and storage periods on the mean sensory sources of whey-guava beverage was significant and significantly changes were observed in total sugars, reducing sugars, non reducing sugars and vitamin C during the storage period. However, whey-guava beverages pasteurized at 70 °C for 35 minutes {{was found to be}} best in terms of sensory quality after 45 days and pH, acidity, protein, total sugars and reducing sugars found to be high than that of the other samples.

Different scenarios (initial contamination levels; PEF treatment conditions; and time-temperature combinations of CCX-M <b>beverages</b> <b>storage</b> after treatment) were simulated. Cocoa addition and PEF treatment resulted in the most influential input factors to control bacterial final load. Cronobacter spp. exposure risk was reduced by a maximum of 100 times at 95 % of iterations due to addition of cocoa at 5 g/ 100 mL, corresponding to scenario 3 (PEF: 15 kV/cm– 3, 000 μs; storage 120 h at 8 °C). Moreover, the probability of illness for a healthy population was reduced from 2. 15 × 10 - 8, in the baseline scenario, to 4. 78 × 10 - 10 due to cocoa addition and application of 15 kV/cm– 3, 000 μs PEF treatment. peer-reviewedM.

40|$|Injection stretch {{blow moulded}} PET bottles {{are the most}} widely used {{container}} type for carbonated soft drinks. PET offers excellent clarity, good mechanical and barrier properties, and ease of processing. Typically, these bottles have a petaloid-shaped base, which gives good stability to the bottle and it is the most appropriate one for <b>beverage</b> <b>storage.</b> However, the base is prone to environmentally induced stress cracking and this a major concern to bottle manufacturers. The object {{of this study is to}} explain the occurrence of stress cracking, and to prevent it by optimising both the geometry of the petaloid base and the processing parameters during bottle moulding. A finite element model of the petaloid shape is developed in CATIA V 5 R 14, and used to predict the von Mises stress in the bottle base for different combinations of three key dimensions of the base: foot length, valley width, and clearance. The combination of dimensions giving the minimum stress is found by a statistical analysis approach using an optimisation and design of experiments software package ECHIP- 7. A bottle mould was manufactured according to the optimum base geometry and PET bottles are produced by injection stretch blow moulding (ISBM). In order to minimise the stresses at the bottom of the bottle, the ISBM process parameters were reviewed and the effects of both the stretch rod movement and the temperature profile of the preform were studied by means of the process simulation software package (Blow View version 8. 2). Simulated values of the wall thickness, stress, crystallinity, molecular orientation and biaxial ratio in the bottle base were obtained. The process parameters, which result in low stress and uniform material in the bottle base, are regarded as optimum operating conditions. In the evaluation process of the optimum bottle base, bottles with standard (current) and optimized (new) base were produced under the same process conditions via a two-stage ISBM machine. In order to compare both the bottles, environmental stress crack resistance, top load strength, burst pressure strength, thermal stability test as well as crystallinity studies ¬¬¬via modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) and morphology studies via environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and optical microscopy were conducted. In this study carried out, the new PET bottle with the optimised base significantly decreased the environmental stress cracking occurrence in the bottom of the bottle. It is found that the bottle with optimised base is stronger than the bottle with standard base against environmental stress cracking. The resistance time against environmental stress cracking are increased by about % 90 under the same operating process conditions used for standard (current) bottles; and by % 170 under the optimised process conditions where the preform re-heating temperature is set to 105 oC...|$|E

Product change due to mass transfer is at stake and, with it, its consumer value and consideration. Carbonation loss takes place at the product/package interface, and to the environment through the package itself. In this paper a joint experimental/computational approach has been exploited: the CO 2 loss through the polyethylene terephthalate barrier has been computed by means of a multidimensional finite element code, while actual measurements have been carried out to validate the computations. Residual carbonation histories are validated and presented for a variety of thermal regimes and for two different bottles carrying the same capacity. The paper highlights on the combination of bottle weight, initial carbonation and storage temperature, indicating the operational set for the longest shelf life within the explored cases. Lighter bottles can be used with no inference on shelf life, while the carbonic loss depends non-linearly on initial carbonation and temperature increment. The associated concentration maps help infer on the importance of polyethylene terephthalate thickness uniformity.

40|$|Fermented {{foods and}} {{beverages}} {{play an important}} role in the human diet as they provide essential nutrients as well as contribute towards prevention of diseases. Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts are a major group of microorganisms associated with fermented products. Some of the microorganisms, known as probiotics, confer health properties to human health. Thus, many different types of fermented foods and beverages containing probiotics are produced around the world to support wellness and health. In recent years, there has been increased interest in the development of fermented functional plant-based foods and beverages due to a surge in scientific research of the products. Further, there is evidence that probiotic microorganisms can grow well in plant-based substrates. Water kefir is a sparkling fermented beverage with an acidic, sweet, slightly alcoholic taste, and a yeasty flavour. Water kefir fermentation can be achieved by the inoculation of water kefir grains as a starter culture into a solution containing sugar. Kefir grains consist of a symbiotic starter culture of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts contained in a polysaccharide matrix. Microorganisms present in kefir grains are recognized as probiotics. The majority of previous studies have focused on the isolation and identification of water kefir cultures responsible for fermentation. There is, therefore, scanty information on the fermentation of plant-based water kefir beverages. The main objective of this study was to develop fermented black tea beverage using water kefir grains as a starter culture. Fermentation of black tea infusions as single and mixed substrate with carrot juice using water kefir grains were investigated. Microflora of water kefir grains used consisted of symbiotic starter culture of lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus spp. and Lactobacillus spp.) and a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The study was conducted in three main phases. The first phase investigated the effect of sucrose concentration (5 % and 10 %) and fermentation temperature (25 °C and 30 °C) in black tea water kefir fermentation for 72 h. Meanwhile, the effect of added carrot juice (5 %, 10 %, and 15 %) on kefir beverage during secondary fermentation (24 h) at 25 °C was investigated in the second phase. The stability of the final black tea water kefir <b>beverage</b> formulation during <b>storage</b> (4 °C) for four weeks was investigated in phase three. Samples of black tea water kefir beverages were subjected to various analyses during fermentation and storage (4 °C) for 4 weeks: titratable acidity, total soluble solids (°Brix), colour, viable cell counts of constituent starter culture, sensory evaluation, sugars, organic acids, antioxidants, and pH was also measured...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years the almond {{beverage}} has experimented an increase on the consume, therefore, the commercialization area has been expanded, almost all around the world. This beverage further than be an alternative to milk for people with lactose intolerance, it is claimed because of its functional qualities that can contribute to reduce or prevent diseases, which are besetting society; this mainly due thanks {{to the content of}} the fatty acids, monounsatured and polyunsatured, and the antioxidants just like E vitamin, phenolic compounds and polyamines. This thesis project was focused on the application of an emerging technology, Ultra High Pressure Homogenization (UHPH), in the production of almond beverage. This non-thermal technology consists of a high pressure machine capable of applying pressures of up to 400 MPa using a special homogenizing system designed to produce a conserving effect, improving the colloidal and microbial stability while maintaining good nutritional and sensory qualities. Considering this hypothesis, UHPH could be an alternative technology to those commonly applied in the food industries. For that, a comparative study of UHPH with thermal treatments (pasteurization) was carried out in this work. This investigation has been conducted through four successive studies. The first study was aimed to optimize processing conditions of the elaboration of a base product of almond beverage for being used in subsequent studies. Moreover, influence of the addition of lecithin as an emulsifier in the stability of pasteurized beverage was studied and the most relevant analytical parameters related to the overall quality of the food were analyzed. In the second study, the influence of the UHPH treatments (200 and 300 MPa, 55, 65 and 75 ºC) were evaluated in the almond beverage characteristics, and they were compared with samples treated with convectional pasteurization, UHT and with based crude product. UHPH at 200 MPa 55 and 75 ºC of inlet temperature were revealed as alternative treatments to pasteurization, and 300 MPa 65 y 75 ºC as alternative to UHT. The UHPH condition of 300 MPa and 65 and 75 ºC inlet temperature was able to produce commercial sterile almond beverages. The third study was the identification of potentially contaminating spoilage microorganisms in treated almond beverage, to evaluate subsequently the lethality produced by UHPH treatments 300 MPa, 55, 65, 75 and 85 °C, in microorganisms with higher resistance to UHPH and most frequently isolated. These microorganisms were Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Lysinibacillus spp. Lethality was complete when treatment was used 300 MPa and 75 and 85 °C inlet temperatures. The second part consisted in the shelf-life evaluation of soymilk treated by UHPH using the selected optimal conditions determined in the previous step Finally, with the selected conditions of UHPH treatments (200 MPa, 55 and 75 ºC), was studied the microbiological, physical and chemical quality of the almond <b>beverage</b> during cold <b>storage</b> time and it was compared with pasteurized almond beverage. Monitoring was conducted every 7 days for 3 weeks. During cold <b>storage,</b> almond <b>beverage</b> samples treated by UHPH at both inlet temperatures had generally better characteristics than pasteurized ones...|$|R
