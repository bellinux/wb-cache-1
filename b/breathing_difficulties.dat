40|$|Abstract Background In the United Kingdom {{there has}} been a long term pattern of {{increases}} in children's emergency admissions and a substantial increase in short stay unplanned admissions. The emergency admission rate (EAR) per thousand population for <b>breathing</b> <b>difficulty,</b> feverish illness and diarrhoea varies substantially between children living in different Primary Care Trusts (PCTs). However, {{there has been}} no examination of whether disadvantage is associated with short stay unplanned admissions at PCT-level. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether differences between emergency hospital admission rates for <b>breathing</b> <b>difficulty,</b> feverish illness and diarrhoea are associated with population-level measures of multiple deprivation and child well-being, and whether there is variation by length of stay and age. Methods Analysis of hospital episode statistics and secondary analysis of Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2007 and Local Index of Child Well-being (CWI) 2009 in ten adjacent PCTs in North West England. The outcome measure for each PCT was the emergency admission rate to hospital for <b>breathing</b> <b>difficulty,</b> feverish illness and diarrhoea. Results 23, 496 children aged 0 - 14 were discharged following emergency admission for <b>breathing</b> <b>difficulty,</b> feverish illness and/or diarrhoea during 2006 / 07. The emergency admission rate ranged from 27. 9 to 62. 7 per thousand. There were no statistically significant relationships between shorter (0 to 3 day) hospitalisations and the IMD or domains of the CWI. The rate for hospitalisations of 4 or more days was associated with the IMD (Kendall's tau b = 0. 64) and domains of the CWI: Environment (tau b = 0. 60); Crime (tau b = 0. 56); Material (tau b = 0. 51); Education (tau b = 0. 51); and Children in Need (tau b = 0. 51). This pattern was also evident in children aged under 1 year, who had the highest emergency admission rates. There were wide variations between the proportions of children discharged on the day of admission at different hospitals. Conclusions Differences between rates of the more common shorter (0 to 3 day) hospitalisations were not explained by deprivation or well-being measured at PCT-level. Indices of multiple deprivation and child well-being were only associated with rates of children's emergency admission for <b>breathing</b> <b>difficulty,</b> feverish illness and diarrhoea for hospitalisations of 4 or more days. </p...|$|R
5|$|Individuals with <b>breathing</b> <b>difficulties</b> due to asthma or allergies may {{experience}} additional barriers to quality sleep {{that can be}} addressed by specific variations of sleep hygiene recommendations. Difficulty with breathing can cause disruptions to sleep, reducing the ability to stay asleep and to achieve restful sleep. For individuals with allergies or asthma, additional considerations {{must be given to}} potential triggers in the bedroom environment. Medications that might improve ability to breathe while sleeping may also impair sleep in other ways, so there must be careful management of decongestants, asthma controllers, and antihistamines.|$|E

5|$|Inflammation is {{a normal}} part of the human immune response, whereby leukocytes (white blood cells), {{including}} neutrophils (white blood cells that specialize in causing inflammation), gather, and chemokines (proteins released from certain cells, which activate or elicit a response from other cells) accumulate at any location in the body where bacterial or viral infections occur. Inflammation interferes with the activity of bacteria and viruses, and serves to clear them from the body. In DPB, bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause the proliferation of inflammatory cells into the bronchiolar tissues. However, when neither bacteria are present with DPB, the inflammation continues for an as yet unknown reason. In either circumstance, inflammation in DPB can be so severe that nodules containing inflammatory cells form in the walls of the bronchioles. The presence of inflammation and infection in the airways also results in the production of excess mucus, which must be coughed up as sputum. The combination of inflammation, nodule development, infection, mucus, and frequent cough contributes to the <b>breathing</b> <b>difficulties</b> in DPB.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} whether emergency hospital admission rates (EAR) for common paediatric conditions in Greater London {{are associated with}} measures of child well-being and deprivation. Design: Retrospective analysis of hospital episode statistics and secondary analysis of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2007 and Local Index of Child Well-Being (CWI) 2009. Setting: 31 Greater London primary care trusts (PCTs). Outcome measures: EAR in PCTs for <b>breathing</b> <b>difficulty,</b> feverish illness and/or diarrhoea. Results: 24, 481 children under 15 years of age were discharged following emergency admission for <b>breathing</b> <b>difficulty,</b> feverish illness and/or diarrhoea during 2007 / 2008. The EAR for <b>breathing</b> <b>difficulty</b> {{was associated with the}} IMD (Spearman’s rho 0. 59, p < 0. 001) and IMD indicators of: overcrowding (Spearman’s rho 0. 62, p < 0. 001), houses in poor condition (Spearman’s rho 0. 55, p= 0. 001), air quality (Spearman’s rho 0. 53, p= 0. 002), homelessness (Spearman’s rho 0. 44, p= 0. 013), and domains of the CWI: housing (Spearman’s rho 0. 64, p < 0. 001), children in need (Spearman’s rho 0. 62, p < 0. 001), material (Spearman’s rho 0. 58, p= 0. 001) and environment (Spearman’s rho 0. 53, p= 0. 002). There were no statistically significant relationships between the EAR of children admitted for feverish illness and diarrhoea or aged under 1 year for any condition, and the IMD, either IMD indicators or CWI domains. Conclusions: Housing and environmental factors are associated with children’s demand for hospital admission for <b>breathing</b> <b>difficulty.</b> Some associations are stronger with the CWI than the IMD. The CWI has potential to identify priority PCTs for housing and environment interventions that could have specific public health benefits for respiratory conditions...|$|R
5|$|Over time, Jackson's facial {{structure}} {{changed as}} well. Surgeons speculated {{he also had}} a rhinoplasty, a forehead lift, cheekbone surgery, altered his lips, and had a cleft put in his chin. Those close to the singer estimated that, by 1990, he had undergone around ten procedures. According to Taraborrelli, Jackson had his first rhinoplasty after breaking his nose during a complex dance routine in 1979. However, the surgery was not a complete success, and he complained of <b>breathing</b> <b>difficulties</b> that would affect his career. He was referred to Steven Hoefflin, who performed his second rhinoplasty in 1981. Katherine Jackson, though, has {{said in a recent interview}} that Michael intentionally got his first nosejob from Steven Hoefflin. Taraborrelli stated Jackson had a third rhinoplasty three years later and a fourth in 1986. Jackson wrote in his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk that, in addition to the two rhinoplasties, {{he also had a}} dimple created in his chin. From 1986 onward he was a regular client of Arnold Klein, a dermatologist who specializes in dermal filler injection, a non-surgical cosmetic procedure.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes {{begins a}} {{relationship}} with Riley Costello (Rob Norbury). Riley's father, Carl (Paul Opacic), takes an instant disliking to Mercedes. This causes tension between Mercedes and Carl and they have sex. Carl and Mercedes begin an affair and Riley later proposes to Mercedes, which she accepts. Carl's son and Riley's brother, Seth (Miles Higson), discovers the affair and threatens to tell Riley. Mercedes tells Seth that he cannot reveal the affair because she is pregnant with Riley's child. She later tells Myra that she lied and is not pregnant. Myra tells Mercedes to fake a miscarriage, which she refuses to do. Mercedes attends an awards ceremony with Riley, where he becomes intoxicated. He accepts an award and attempts to get Mercedes onto the podium, but her high heel becomes trapped in the step. As Riley pulls her, she loses her balance and falls to the ground. Myra then declares that Mercedes is having a miscarriage. Mercedes is taken to hospital, where she is told that she is in fact twelve weeks pregnant. She explains to Myra that she is unsure of the child's paternity. On her wedding day to Riley, she reveals her affair with Carl. Riley's grandfather, Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle), who is a serial killer, kidnaps Mercedes {{as a result of}} her behaviour and holds her captive in a basement, planning to kill her when the baby is born. While Mercedes is in the basement, Silas is arrested for four murders, leaving Mercedes trapped while she goes into labour. Lynsey asks Silas to tell them where Mercedes is, but he refuses. She taunts him until eventually he reveals her whereabouts. Riley finds Mercedes, who is about to give birth. Mercedes gives birth to a baby boy, who is put in an incubator because of <b>breathing</b> <b>difficulties.</b> Mercedes is hurt when, after the birth, Riley declares he wants nothing more to do with Mercedes or the baby. However, he later continues to visit Mercedes and the baby who Mercedes names Bobby. Mercedes returns to live with the McQueens and after Riley refuses to see Bobby, Mercedes agrees to do a paternity test. The results confirm that Riley is Bobby's biological father. Mercedes and Riley argue over Bobby until Riley is transferred to a football club in Leeds and Mercedes asks him to take Bobby with him.|$|E
