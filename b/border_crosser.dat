40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} meaning of being a <b>border</b> <b>crosser</b> in the Tijuana-San Diego region. It {{presents}} {{a brief history of}} this region and a discussion of pertinent theory. The personal narratives of transborder commuters shaped and guided the research. This thesis focuses on the narratives of six transborder commuters and one person who was raised undocumented in the San Diego-Tijuana region but has crossed borders throughout her life. This work parts from the notion that 'border performativity,' theorized by Nancy A. Wonders, plays a central role in {{the meaning of}} being a <b>border</b> <b>crosser.</b> The border is performed everyday on commuters at the border crossing. Commuters also participate in border performativity in the everyday, mundane things that they go through in attempting to cross the border. The notion of 'superación,' bettering oneself, is central to the search for freedom of mobility. This thesis also argues that in order to discuss border crossing it is necessary to discuss the differential access to crossing the border. Lastly, this thesis interrogates how people situate themselves and construct their culture in the border region. This thesis does not purport to present a full representation of transborder commuters but rather what it means to be a <b>border</b> <b>crosser</b> for the people I interviewe...|$|E

This paper reconstructs the mutiny from Dutch records and uses it to look at the role of soldiers as <b>border</b> <b>crosser</b> in the Atlantic world. Colonial historians have usually studied soldiers in their capacity of border enforcers, men who maintained the cultural and legal divisions that supported colonial authority. However, as I show, soldiers with great regularity crossed those same borders, threatening the very foundations of colonialism...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{contemporary}} European labour migration, where the most publicised pattern of labour migration sees Eastern European migrants move West, the dominant scholarly interpretation of Polish jokes is not applicable {{for the analysis of}} much of the joking by or about the Poles. Humour scholars frequently categorise jokes about ethnic groups into stupid or canny categories, and the Poles have been the butt of stupidity (‘Polack’) jokes in Europe and the United States. Today, in the European Union, Polish stupidity stereotyping in humour is less active and the Polish immigrant is hard working and a threat to indigenous labour, yet joking does not depict this threat in a canny Pole. The article applies the liminal concept of the trickster – an ambiguous <b>border</b> <b>crosser</b> or traveller – to elaborate some of the characteristics of jokes told by and about Polish migrants in the EU, mainly in the British context. A more robust explanatory framework is thus offered than is currently available in humour studies...|$|E

40|$|Largely in {{response}} to irregular migration flows, a Euro-African border is under construction at the southern edges of Europe. The latest phase in this 'borderwork' is a system known as Eurosur, underpinned by {{a vision of a}} streamlined surveillance cover of Europe's southern maritime border and the African 'pre-frontier' beyond it. Eurosur and other policing initiatives pull in a range of sectors - from border guards to aid workers - that make the statistically small figure of the irregular <b>border</b> <b>crosser</b> their joint target. To highlight the economic and productive aspects of controlling migratory flows, I call this varied group of interests an 'illegality industry'. Casting an eye on the Spanish section of the external EU border, this article investigates how the illegality industry conceptualizes migrants as a source of risk to be managed, visualized and controlled. The end result, it is argued, is a 'double securitization' of migrant flows, rendering these as both a security threat and a growing source of profits...|$|E

First made {{available}} 24 July 2017 Joseph Roth possessed a sharply observant eye which {{allowed him to}} clearly read the signs of his times – those divided years of the 1920 s and 1930 s in Europe – a quality that has earned him the dubious epitaph “prophet”; a drunken prophet, as Europe’s demise into another world war went {{hand in hand with}} his own physical decline through alcoholism. Roth, his black coat draped around his shoulders, newspaper under his arm, cigarette and drink in hand while slowly moving from one hotel to another, was a <b>border</b> <b>crosser,</b> a train traveller, an observer and a hotel patriot. 2 He was a literary exile who chose an itinerant existence; a highly prolific journalist and novelist who entertained friends and acquaintances at his café table in Paris and who drank himself to death at the early age of 44. Often noted for his cosmopolitan flair, Roth received extraordinarily high book advances but {{spent most of his time}} in a perpetual financial worry; a man who, in line with his skilled journalistic eye for detail, had a great passion for the miniature universe of watches and clocks, a predilection mirrored in his miniscule and delicate handwriting...|$|E
40|$|Literary {{criticism}} nowadays {{is essentially}} crossing {{the boundaries of}} disciplinarity and canonicity where literary theory has increasingly been shaped by overlapping concepts and branching out of theories as well as whipping out the limitations imposed by theory itself. The post-conditions of contemporaneity have imposed a view of reading and analysing the literary text that is dynamic, proliferated and in flux as well as resistant to monolithic critique and confined disciplines and professionalization. This outlook has increasingly made the notions of literary criticism, theoretical paradigms and canons not only artificial and irrelevant to our materialistic world, but, in many cases, ‘violent’ to those whose life concerns exist {{in the margins of}} these paradigmatic notions. In this essay, I argue {{that those of us who}} aspire to an interdisciplinary and a metacritical analyses would be well served by importing inspirations from Edward Said’s work, scholarship and life, particularly drawing on his ‘Worldliness’, ‘Amateurism’ and ‘Heteroglossia’ (or heterotopia) as well as drawing examples from his negotiation with intellectual paradoxes and tensions informed by his positionality as a <b>border</b> <b>crosser</b> intellectual (or his exilic consciousness). Specifically, this article engages with Said as an author of a radically secular body of work marked by as comportment towards being, and as an example of an “amateur” critic who “speak[s] truth to power”. It argues that Said instates a critically-interrogative scholarship as antidote to essentialist, politicised, determinist and hegemonic literary canons (whether those of texts or theory) which are paradigmatically informed by relations of power in academia. The paper argues that through the investment of his scholarship and personal life, Said rejects academic institutions and affiliations with their tendency towards doctrinaire assumptions of critical work. Further to this, Said’s fascination of diversity, heterogeneity and his advocacy of the intellectual’s detachment from the institution of specialised criticism mount up as a radical critique of specialisation and professionalism and denouncing them as being allied with ideological and cultural dogma.

40|$|For too long, {{the policy}} debate over border {{enforcement}} has been split {{between those who}} believe the border can be sealed against illegal entry by force alone, and {{those who believe that}} any effort to do so is futile and without expanded legal work opportunities. And for too long, both sides have been able to muster evidence to make their cases — the enforcers pointing to targeted successes at sealing the border, and the critics pointing to continued illegal entry despite the billions spent on enforcement. Until recently it has been hard to referee the disputes with any confidence because the data was simply inadequate — both sides could muster their preferred measures to make their case. But improvements in both data and analysis are increasingly making it possible to offer answers to the critical question of the effectiveness of border enforcement in stopping and deterring illegal entry. The new evidence suggests that unauthorized migration across the southern border has plummeted, with successful illegal entries falling from roughly 1. 8 million in 2000 to just 200, 000 by 2015. Border enforcement has been a significant reason for the decline — in particular, the growing use of “consequences” such as jail time for illegal border crossers has had a powerful effect in deterring repeated border crossing efforts. The success of deterrence through enforcement has meant that attempted crossings have fallen dramatically even as the likelihood of a <b>border</b> <b>crosser</b> being apprehended by the Border Patrol has only risen slightly, to just over a 50 - 50 chance. These research advances should help to inform a more rational public debate over the incremental benefits of additional border enforcement expenditures. With Congress gearing up to consider budget proposals from the Trump administration that seek an additional $ 2. 6 billion for border security, including construction of new physical barriers, the debate is long overdue. In particular, Congress should be taking a careful look at the incremental gains that might come from additional spending on border enforcement. The evidence suggests that deterrence through enforcement, despite its successes to date in reducing illegal entry across the border, is producing diminishing returns. There are three primary reasons. First, arrivals at the border are increasingly made up of asylum seekers from Central America rather than traditional economic migrants from Mexico; this is a population that is both harder to deter because of the dangers they face at home, and in many cases not appropriate to deter because the United States has legal obligations to consider serious requests for asylum. Second, the majority of additions to the US unauthorized population is now arriving on legal visas and then overstaying; enforcement at the southern border does nothing to respond to this challenge. And finally, among Mexican migrants, a growing percentage of the repeat border crossers are parents with children left behind in the United States, a population that is far harder to deter than young economic migrants. The administration could better inform this debate by releasing to scholars and the public the research it has sponsored in order to give Americans a fuller picture on border enforcement...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis considers the ability of westerners, primarily teachers, to work cross-culturally with indigenous students {{in four of the}} settler states, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA. It looks particularly at identity learning as a way in which westerners enhance their understanding and attitudes to another culture. Identity learning, and culture shock as an associated process, is examined in relation to the ideas of border crossing and culture brokerage. A number of issues were raised, some through the literature, which became foci for the research. Examination of border crossing indicated that some westerners were successful as cross-cultural communicators but did not suggest why. Discussions of cultural borders gave rise to their critique as being essentialised but failed to suggest how this was to be overcome. Anthropological models did not give any characterisation to the role of culture broker, although the ethnohistory literature gave some insight. The influence of culture shock on westerners working in indigenous communities in the settler states was not particularly understood nor its relationship to identity learning explored. A qualitative methodology is used involving a series of interviews with eight participants who were considered to be experienced in cross-cultural communication with a background in education. From the interviews a series of narratives were written which revealed their experiences and understandings particularly about their border crossings, culture brokerage and opinions regarding teaching indigenous students and teaching them science. These narratives became the major source of data for analysis. This research shows that many westerners who are successful working in cross-cultural settings value the culture of their indigenous hosts. This is the consequence of enhanced identity learning and can be the result of culture shock. Not all westerners learn to value the other culture and may either leave the community or stay for some other reason. Border crossers are able to think beyond the limitations of an essentialised ‘we and they’ dichotomy and locate themselves in other ways relative to the border. Culture brokerage is a strategy that individuals choose to use, sometimes on the behalf of a government or institution. The characteristics of an effective culture broker are those of a <b>border</b> <b>crosser</b> and this establishes a nexus between border crossing and culture brokerage. Suggestions regarding preparation to teach in indigenous communities reflect the enhancement of identity learning and promotion of border crossing. Preservice training should include experience practicum teaching with indigenous students. Effective teaching of indigenous students could be supported by hiring experienced teachers and extending their stays. All teachers who go to work in indigenous communities {{need to be aware of}} culture shock and its possible impact and mechanisms for minimising its impact need to be established through mentoring programs. The context of the students needs to be taken into account by consideration of their culture and appropriate interpretation of the curriculum and implementation of teaching strategies. Teachers need to acknowledge that they are in positions of power but need to negotiate that respectfully with their indigenous students. As teachers of science they need to have a more inclusive idea of the nature of science so they can facilitate the border crossings of their indigenous students...|$|E
