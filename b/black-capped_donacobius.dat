50|$|Mating for life, {{pairs of}} <b>black-capped</b> <b>donacobiuses</b> {{can be seen}} {{frequently}} and throughout the day atop thickets of dense lakeside or streamside vegetation. They often will engage in antiphonic dueting. Adult offspring will remain with their parents and help raise siblings from subsequent nesting periods {{in a system of}} cooperative breeding.|$|R
50|$|<b>Black-capped</b> <b>donacobiuses</b> {{are common}} {{in a wide range}} of Amazonian wetlands, {{including}} oxbow lakes, riparian zones, and other areas with tall dense aquatic or semi-aquatic vegetation. A third of the species range is outside the Amazon Basin, from Panama, northern Colombia, and western Venezuela, the Orinoco River system of Venezuela, to southeast coastal and inland Brazil, and neighboring countries southward, Paraguay, and extreme northern Argentina.|$|R
5000|$|The call is a loud {{metallic}} [...] "tew-tew-tew-tew" [...] {{similar to}} that of a <b>black-capped</b> <b>donacobius.</b> It is usually sung from the top of a shrub.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black-capped</b> <b>donacobius,</b> Donacobius atricapillus, {{which was}} long {{considered}} an aberrant wren or mockingbird is apparently quite closely related, and might possibly {{be considered the}} only American species of this family.|$|E
5000|$|Bradypterus, the megalurid bush-warblers, {{belong to}} in the Megaluridae, the grass-warbler family which {{is closely related to}} the Malagasy warblers and the {{peculiar}} <b>black-capped</b> <b>donacobius</b> from South America, formerly believed to be an aberrant wren.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black-capped</b> <b>donacobius</b> (Donacobius atricapilla) is a conspicuous, vocal South American bird. It {{is found}} in {{tropical}} swamps and wetlands in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela; also Panama of Central America.|$|E
5000|$|Among the [...] "warbler and babbler" [...] {{superfamily}} Sylvioidea, the Locustellidae are {{closest to}} the Malagasy warblers, another newly recognized (and hitherto unnamed) family; the <b>black-capped</b> <b>donacobius</b> (Donacobius atricapillus) is an American relative derived from the same ancestral stock and not a wren as was long believed.|$|E
50|$|Revised {{following}} Martínez Gómez et al. (2005) and Mann et al. (2006), {{the taxonomy}} of some groups is highly complex, and future species-level splits are likely. Additionally, undescribed taxa {{are known to}} exist. The <b>black-capped</b> <b>donacobius</b> is an enigmatic species traditionally placed with the wrens more {{for lack of a}} more apparent alternative and/or thorough study. It was more recently determined to be most likely closer to certain warblers, possibly the newly established Megaluridae, and might constitute a monotypic family.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>black-capped</b> <b>donacobius</b> is {{the only}} member of the genus Donacobius. Its {{familial}} placement is not established, and ornithologists disagree as to its closest relations. In the 19th century, it was placed in the Turdidae, and in the 20th century, moved to the Mimidae. It had various English names, including the [...] "black-capped mockingthrush". In the 1980s and 1990s, suggestions that it was a type of wren (Troglodytidae) were accepted by the South American Classification Committee (SACC), the American Ornithologists Union (AOU) and most other authorities. More recently, listing organizations and authors follow Van Remsen and Keith Barker's conclusion that it is not a wren either, but instead most closely related to an Old World (probably African) lineage. [...] A current proposal to the SACC would create a monotypic family, Donacobiidae, for this species, but this is not universally accepted as some authorities insist it may prove to be a member of an existing Old World family, presumably the Locustellidae which seem to be its closest living relatives. These are long-tailed [...] "warblers" [...] from around the Indian Ocean region, many of which despite their cryptic coloration, smaller size and more solitary habits, are similar to the donacobius in stance, habitat and some aspects of their behavior (such as the nests); these [...] "warblers" [...] also have a similarly voice, but being higher-pitched they sound less grating and more like locusts (namely in Locustella).|$|E
