50|$|In January 2014, Indonesian Ministry of Law and Human Rights {{announced}} a future design of ordinary Indonesian passport, coinciding the 64th {{anniversary of the}} Indonesian Directorate General of Immigration. The main difference would be the material of the page <b>bearing</b> <b>holder's</b> identity. The new version will use polycarbonate instead of laminated paper. Ministry of Law and Human Rights Amir Syamsudin stated that the on-working change is expected to reduce passport forgery. Another difference is the design of passport holder's photograph. In the upcoming version, 3 photographs of the passport holder will be displayed using 3D technology, each on the left, middle and {{the right side of}} the page. The visa pages will be decorated using item(s) that describe Indonesian flora, fauna or culture. Although the official information has been released, there is currently no exact date of the implementation.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that, in a rotor system with a radial {{clearance}} between a rotating part (ex. shaft) and a static part (ex. guide), a forward rubbing with the same angular speed as the rotational speed, a backward rubbing with an angular speed proportional to, and various kinds of nonlinear resonances occur. On the contrary, some rotor systems have a clearance between a movable but non-rotating part and a static part. For example, a squeeze-film damper bearing has a clearance between a <b>bearing</b> <b>holder</b> and housing. In such a system, a self-excited oscillation occurs in addition to various kinds of nonlinear resonances. In this paper, the characteristics of this self-excited oscillation are investigated and the mechanism of the occurrence of a self-excited oscillation is clarified by considering energy balance...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{describes}} friction properties of sintered copper alloy journal bearing. Sulfide contained copper alloy material studied as {{the material of}} the journal bearing. The micro structure of the copper alloy was consisted from micro sized pores and sulfide phase mainly dispersed at the boundary region. For the purpose of friction study, the sliding surface of the journal bearing was {{in the form of}} machined texture. A spiral groove was applied to the inner surface of the journal and graphite was occasionally penetrated into the groove. The experiment was carried out using a developed testing apparatus that consists of a spindle driven with an air cooled DC motor and a disc shape <b>bearing</b> <b>holder</b> in air atmosphere without lubricants. The hardened steel shaft having fine ground surface was used as the mating specimen. The results found that the application of spiral groove with graphite penetration was effective to increase the sliding distance up to the occurrence of seizure. In particular, the graphite penetration resulted in significant increase in the sliding distance despite that the decrease in friction coefficient. It was estimated that the application of the groove with graphite penetration restricted the transfer of the journal elements on the mating steel surface...|$|E

40|$|High speed {{machining}} using vertical CNC milling centres {{continues to}} be a popular approach in a variety of industries including aerospace,automobile,mould and die casting etc. Chatter oscillations have significant influence in restricting the metal removal rates of the machining process. The cutting process instability or chatter is assessed by prediction of frequency response at the tool tip. Present work aims at evaluating the combined effect of a spindle-housing and tool holder on the dynamics of cutting tool by considering the flexibility of spindle unit supported on bearings. The spindle-tool is analysed by using finite element modeling using Timoshenko beam theory. The dynamic characteristics and tool-tip frequency responses are obtained without considering the cutting forces. The results are compared with receptance coupling approach and using 3 D modeling in ANSYS. Further experimental modal analysis on the machining spindle of same dimensions has revealed the same dynamic modes. Using the validated FE model of the system,the effects of nonlinear <b>bearing</b> contact forces,spindle-tool <b>holder</b> interface stiffness,bearing span and axial preload, tool overhang and diameter on the frequency response and cutting process stability are studied. Optimal spindle-tool system is designed for achieving maximum dynamic stiffness. The analytically stability lobe diagrams are obtained from the real and imaginary terms of these frequency responses at the tool tip. Dynamic stability issues in helical end-milling using the two and three dimensional cutting force models are considered for the analysis. The stability boundaries are experimentally verified using the cutting tests on both CNC milling spindle and modified drilling tool spindle systems while machining Al-alloy work pieces. Vibration and sound pressure levels are also employed to assure the stability of cutting operations,while surface images are used to identify the chatter marks at various combinations of cutting parameters. Dynamic milling model is employed with the flexible spindle-tool system by considering several effects including variable tool pitch, tool run-out,nonlinear feed forces and process damping. Design and stability studies on the modified drill spindle with a custom-designed work table for milling operations allowed in understanding several interesting facts about spindle-tool systems. Some control strategies including semi-active and active methods are implemented using finite element model of the spindle-tool system to minimize the chatter vibration levels/maximize the stable depth of cut during cutting operations...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{adapting}} a 9 - 0 cm X-ray camera isdescribed. Although scattering {{in the region}} 20 - 100;x cannot be called low angle scatter there are many clay mineral investigations in which dear recording of this region is required. We have found that 9 - 0 cm diameter powder cameras based {{on the design of}} the 19. 0 cm camera described by Bradley, Lipson, and Petch (194 I) can be modified to recorded spacings in this region. The cameras we normally use are modified as suggested by MacEwan (1949) and have a punched slot in the film with a locating peg instead of the more usual beam catcher. To eliminate air scatter at low angles the cameras are usually evacuated. For some investigations it is not desirable to evacuate the camera and in these cases a beam catcher is more useful. In this note a modification of the 9 " 0 cm camera is described which allows either a beam catcher or the punched slot method to be used with the same camera. The locating peg and the beam catcher are easily interchangeable and so also are beam catchers of different sizes. There is a fine adjustment which allows the beam catcher or the locating peg to be adjusted accurately and quickly. With a beam catcher 0. 5 mm wide, at a distance of 2 cm from the specimen, spacings up to 80. ~ can be dearly recorded with Co Kct radiation {{and there would be no}} great difficulty in extending this to somewhat lower angles. The short specimen to fihn distance, 4. 5 cm, and the facilities for evacua-tion which the camera already provides are further useful attributes. The beam is collimated by a double slit system both sets of which are adjustable. The first slit is on the film ring and the second slit is as near the specimen as possible. This arrangement combined with a foreshortened view of the focus gives narrow well-collimated beams. The beam catcher or the locating peg for the punched film are carried by a plate which rests on the top plate of the camera and which pivots about the conical specimen <b>holder</b> <b>bearing.</b> This plate has a fine adjustment and two locking screws. The beam catcher or locating peg is carried in a radial rectangular slot in the plate whic...|$|R
