40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} effect of common network attacks on the performance, and {{security}} of several <b>biometric</b> <b>readers.</b> Experiments are con-ducted using Denial of Service attacks (DoSs) and the ARP cache poisoning at-tack. The experiments show that the tested <b>biometric</b> <b>readers</b> are vulnerable to DoS attacks, and their recognition performance is significantly affected after launching the attacks. However, the experiments show that the tested <b>biometric</b> <b>readers</b> are secure from the ARP cache poisoning attack. This work demon-strates that <b>biometric</b> <b>readers</b> are easy targets for malicious network users, lack basic security mechanisms, and are vulnerable to common attacks. The confi-dentiality, and integrity of the log files in the <b>biometric</b> <b>readers,</b> could be com-promised with such attacks. It then becomes important to study these attacks {{in order to find}} flags that could aid in a network forensic investigation of a bio-metric device...|$|R

50|$|On May 14, 2007, {{the company}} {{introduced}} three new products for unified communications compatible with Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 and Microsoft Office Communicator 2007. For example, the terminal LG-Nortel IP Phone 8540's includes {{the operating system}} Windows CE, and Microsoft Office Communicator 2007. It also includes a <b>biometric</b> <b>reader</b> for security. The user can at any time consult their Outlook calendar, mail or the condition of presence of his associates on the telephone.|$|E
50|$|All {{biometric}} readers work similarly, {{by comparing}} the template stored in memory to the scan obtained {{during the process of}} identification. If there is a high enough degree of probability that the template in the memory is compatible with the live scan (the scan belongs to the authorized person), the ID number of that person is sent to a control panel. The control panel then checks the permission level of the user and determines whether access should be allowed. The communication between the reader and the control panel is usually transmitted using the industry standard Wiegand interface. The only exception is the intelligent <b>biometric</b> <b>reader,</b> which does not require any panels and directly controls all door hardware.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, time clocks {{started to move}} away from the {{mechanical}} machines to computer-based, electronic time and attendance systems. The employee either swipes a magnetic stripe card, scans a barcode, brings an RFID (radio-frequency identification) tag into proximity with a reader, enters an employee number or uses a <b>biometric</b> <b>reader</b> to identify the employee to the system. These systems are much more advanced than the mechanical time clock: various reports can be generated, including on compliance with the European Working Time Directive, and a Bradford factor report. Employees can also use the gadget to request holidays, enter absenteeism requests and view their worked hours. User interfaces can be personalized and offer robust self-service capabilities.|$|E
50|$|The {{university}} has 28 acres serene campus with state of art infrastructure. The {{university has}} fully Wi-Fi campus, gym facility, and air conditioned hostel and class rooms. Presently central library has books with 8000 titles and 60000 volumes.

5000|$|In the 1-to-1 mode a user {{must first}} either present an ID card or enter a PIN. The reader then looks up the {{template}} of the corresponding user {{in the database}} and compares it with the live scan. The 1-to-1 method is considered more secure and is generally faster as the reader needs to perform only one comparison. Most 1-to-1 <b>biometric</b> <b>readers</b> are [...] "dual-technology" [...] readers: they either have a built-in proximity, smart card or keypad reader, or they have an input for connecting an external card reader.|$|R

50|$|A {{contactless}} {{smart card}} uses the same radio-based technology as the proximity card, {{with the exception of}} the frequency band used: it uses a higher frequency (13.56 MHz instead of 125 kHz), which allows the transfer of more data, and communication with several cards at the same time. A contactless card does not have to touch the reader or even be taken out of a wallet or purse. Most access control systems only read serial numbers of {{contactless smart card}}s and do not utilize the available memory. Card memory may be used for storing biometric data (i.e. fingerprint template) of a user. In such case a <b>biometric</b> <b>reader</b> first reads the template on the card and then compares it to the finger (hand, eye, etc.) presented by the user. In this way biometric data of users does not have to be distributed and stored in the memory of controllers or readers, which simplifies the system and reduces memory requirements.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in {{the eighth}} season, a new opening {{sequence}} has been featured with the Robot Chicken being uncovered in snow frozen in a block of ice by cyborgs. Taken back to the futuristic laboratory, the Robot Chicken is taken out of suspended animation by a masked scientist, revealed to be a descendant of the mad scientist who first reanimated the Robot Chicken. The descendant mad scientist then proceeds to force the Robot Chicken to watch a wall of projected images with different shows, as his ancestor did before him. This new opening was necessary following {{the plot of the}} episode [...] "Chipotle Miserables", in which the mad scientist's son rips out his father's remaining eye to open a door controlled by an optical <b>biometric</b> <b>reader,</b> and then creates a posse of reanimated half-cyborg animals, as well as a cyborg homeless person. The posse then proceeds to kidnap all 5 living Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. The Robot Chicken and Mad Scientist then team up to rescue the presidents, after which, the Robot Chicken flies away, free.|$|E
50|$|An {{access control}} point {{can be a}} door, turnstile, parking gate, elevator, or other {{physical}} barrier, where granting access can be electronically controlled. Typically, the access point is a door. An electronic access control door can contain several elements. At its most basic, there is a stand-alone electric lock. The lock is unlocked by an operator with a switch. To automate this, operator intervention {{is replaced by a}} reader. The reader could be a keypad where a code is entered, it could be a card reader, or it could be a <b>biometric</b> <b>reader.</b> Readers do not usually make an access decision, but send a card number to an access control panel that verifies the number against an access list. To monitor the door position a magnetic door switch can be used. In concept, the door switch is not unlike those on refrigerators or car doors. Generally only entry is controlled, and exit is uncontrolled. In cases where exit is also controlled, a second reader is used {{on the opposite side of}} the door. In cases where exit is not controlled, free exit, a device called a request-to-exit (REX) is used. Request-to-exit devices can be a push-button or a motion detector. When the button is pushed, or the motion detector detects motion at the door, the door alarm is temporarily ignored while the door is opened. Exiting a door without having to electrically unlock the door is called mechanical free egress. This is an important safety feature. In cases where the lock must be electrically unlocked on exit, the request-to-exit device also unlocks the door.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concerns}} {{as with any}} other application of biometrics for identification and authentication can be manifold. There is, for example, the possibility of voter disenfranchisement when characteristics typically used to identify or verify voters might become unavailable (e.g. bandaged finger, loss of a finger, failure to acquire due to dirt or fingerprint quality degradation). Similarly, there are also claims of potential logistical and procedural [...] "new problems" [...] that biometric identification devices can bring to an election cycle: increasing costs (initial purchase costs of <b>biometric</b> <b>readers</b> and infrastructure, costs linked to maintenance, storage and upgrades) and resources' allocation (human, time, material); additional training of commissions and polling staff, technological failures that could disenfranchise voters; and extra data storage that demands higher security.|$|R
5000|$|Biometric time clocks are {{a feature}} of more {{advanced}} time and attendance systems. Rather than using a key, code or chip to identify the user, they rely on a unique attribute of the user, such as a hand print, finger print, finger vein, palm vein, facial recognition, iris or retina. The user will have their attribute scanned into the system. <b>Biometric</b> <b>readers</b> are often {{used in conjunction with}} an access control system, granting the user access to a building, {{and at the same time}} clocking them in recording the time and date. These systems also attempt to cut down on fraud such as [...] "buddy clocking." [...] When combined with an access control system they can help prevent other types of fraud such as 'ghost employees', where additional identities are added to payroll but don't exist.|$|R

40|$|Access {{control systems}} using {{biometric}} identification readers are becoming common within critical infrastructure and other high security applications. There {{is a perception}} that biometric, due {{to their ability to}} identify and validate the user, are more secure. However, biometric systems are vulnerable to many categories of attack vectors and there has been restricted research into such defeat vulnerabilities. This study expands on a past article (Brooks, 2009) that presented a defeat evaluation methodology applied to high-security biometric readers. The defeat methodology is represented, but applied to both fingerprint and back-of-hand biometric readers. Defeat evaluation included both physical and technical integrity testing, considering zero-effort to adversarial complex attacks. In addition, the evaluation considered the whole device and not just the biometric extraction and storage device. The study found a number of common vulnerabilities in the various types of biometric readers. Vulnerabilities included the ability to spoof optical readers with another person’s extracted print, use of inanimate objects to enrol and validate, defeat of live detection and the ability to by-pass the <b>biometric</b> <b>reader.</b> Optical sensors appeared the least secure, with capacitive the most secure.

40|$|Biometric {{authentication}} systems {{represent a}} valid {{alternative to the}} conventional username-password based approach for user authentication. However, authentication systems composed of a <b>biometric</b> <b>reader,</b> a smartcard reader, and a networked workstation which perform user authentication via software algorithms {{have been found to}} be vulnerable in two areas: firstly in their communication channels between readers and workstation (communication attacks) and secondly through their processing algorithms and/or matching results overriding (replay attacks, confidentiality and integrity threats related to the stored information of the networked workstation). In this paper, a full hardware access point for HPC environments is proposed. The access point is composed of a fingerprint scanner, a smartcard reader, and a hardware core for fingerprint processing and matching. The hardware processing core can be described as a Handel-C algorithmic-like hardware programming language and prototyped via a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based board. The known indexes False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) have been used to test the prototype authentication accuracy. Experimental trials conducted on several fingerprint DBs show that the hardware prototype achieves a working point with FAR= 1. 07 % and FRR= 8. 33 % on a proprietary DB which was acquired via a capacitive scanner, a working point with FAR= 0. 66 % and FRR= 6. 13 % on a proprietary DB which was acquired via an optical scanner, and a working point with FAR= 1. 52 % and FRR= 9. 64 % on the official FVC 2002 -DB 2 B database.
