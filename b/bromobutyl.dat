50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{halogenated}} {{butyl rubber}} (halobutyl) was developed, in its chlorinated (chlorobutyl) and brominated (<b>bromobutyl)</b> variants, providing significantly higher curing rates and allowing covulcanization with other rubbers such as natural rubber and styrene-butadiene rubber.

40|$|Rubber {{systems have}} been studied since the early twentieth century. These systems are {{challenging}} to characterize given the performance dependence on factors such as adhesion and energy dissipation. Further complicating this is {{the wide variety of}} material recipes, two of which were studied here. An in situ optical microtribometer developed to examine contact between two solids was used to garner insight into the behavior of these elastomeric materials. This work describes an experimental study of two rubbers commonly used in sealing applications to provide insight into elastomeric tribology. Experiments were executed to study the contact area of <b>bromobutyl</b> and nitrile rubber as they were loaded against glass and polymer counter surfaces. During loading, both materials experienced a nearly linear increase of real contact area with load. When unloaded, the materials experienced a hysteresis effect, resulting from the increase in energy required to separate the sample from the counter sample. This has been explained using crack propagation theory, where more energy is required to open a crack than to close it. The <b>bromobutyl</b> rubber experienced a larger hysteresis in unloading and required a higher pull-off force to separate the material from the counter surface due to stronger adhesion present in these systems when compared to the nitrile systems. The contact area of the rubbers against glass was studied at velocities of 10 µm/s and 50 µm/s. The contact area decreased with higher friction for both materials, due to the higher friction force causing the material to shear more. Previous studies have found an increase in friction force with an increase in sliding velocity. In the cases of the <b>bromobutyl</b> rubber, the higher friction force did not always occur at the faster sliding velocity and the nitrile rubber saw the inverse trend: the friction force was higher at the slower sliding velocity (10 µm/s). This is thought {{to be the result of}} another mechanism influencing contact area during sliding, which again is related to crack theory and appears to dominate at slower sliding speeds. Friction studies of the nitrile rubber at sliding velocity of 1000 µm/s resulted in higher coefficients of friction, indicating that the increase in coefficient of friction with sliding speeds is relevant for speeds significant enough to result in non-adhesive sliding. Friction studies were performed to study the gliding and break loose coefficients of friction for the nitrile and <b>bromobutyl</b> samples. The nitrile rubber coefficients of friction were consistently lower than that of the <b>bromobutyl</b> rubber for both counter surfaces. The gliding coefficient of friction for the nitrile rubber on glass was similar for all loads (5 mN, 10 mN, 15 mN, 20 mN, and 100 mN) and around 0. 6; the gliding coefficient of friction for <b>bromobutyl</b> rubber on glass decreased with increasing load due to the influence of adhesion at lower loads. For cases of higher loading, the <b>bromobutyl</b> rubber did not achieve break loose and required lubrication for gliding. The presence of silicone oil significantly reduced the break loose friction coefficient and allowed gliding. When lubricated, the gliding coefficient of friction was similar for both loads and velocities used, but the break loose force was significantly different from Fn= 100 mN to Fn= 1800 mN. This break loose force was also found to be time dependent: the longer the rubber is in contact with the counter surface, the more force required to separate the surfaces to commence gliding...|$|E

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of graphene oxide (GO) nanoplatelets in a <b>bromobutyl</b> rubber (BBR) matrix has been tailored by exploiting the rubber latex mixing process to confine nanoparticles among latex microspheres, thus obtaining a segregated arrangement. The gas transport properties and the dielectric behavior of these nanocomposites displaying a ‘segregated’ morphology have been compared, for different filler contents, to those of BBR/GO nanocomposites in which the nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed within the rubber matrix. Relevant qualitative and quantitative differences emerge from the comparison of {{the properties of the}} two families of GO-based samples. It has been found that the segregated morphology enables a significant enhancement of the barrier properties of pristine rubber already at low levels of nanofiller loading. In addition, an exceptionally low value of the electrical percolation threshold has been detected, which is more than one order of magnitude lower than in the case of uniform filler dispersion. These effects are a direct consequence of the assembly and confinement of nanoparticles among the rubber latex microspheres...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development of}} rubber compounds for air-conditioning hoses {{designed to meet the}} stringent demands of the automotive industry.

The influence of temperature, concentration of filler and amplitude and frequency of strains is analyzed on the mechanical response of filled rubbery polymers. Constitutive equations are derived using the concept of two interpenetrating networks: one comprises semiflexible polymeric chains connected to temporary junctions, whereas the other is formed by aggregated filler clusters. Adjustable parameters are found by fitting experimental data for natural rubber, <b>bromobutyl</b> rubber and styrene–butadiene rubber reinforced by carbon black and polymeric particles. The critical concentration of particles is determined that characterizes transition from an ensemble of disjoint clusters to the network of filler. The volume fraction of filler corresponding to this transition is found to be close to theoretical predictions based on the percolation theory, as well as to experimental data for isolator–conductor transition. ...|$|E

Friction properties of symmetrical and close-to-symmetrical block copolymers were evaluated in contact with <b>bromobutyl</b> rubber in a plate-on-plate configuration. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the copolymer films were all covered by an at least a 10 nm thick layer of PDMS. The lubricating effect remained constant down to a film thickness comparable to the chain dimensions of the copolymer, R- 0, after which it decreased progressively. At thicknesses below R- 0, the copolymer dewetted the wafer and formed discrete domains with sizes comparable to R- 0. The copolymer could further be blended with up to 70 wt % polystyrene without detecting {{a decrease in the}} lubricating effect. A mechanism is proposed for the observed frictional behavior where microflakes are abraded from lamellar copolymer surfaces and stick to the contacting rubber surface, whereafter lubrication may result from sliding of PDMS brushes against each other...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{development}} and characterization of an intrinsically self-healable material based on butyl imidazole modified <b>bromobutyl</b> rubber (BIIR) /natural rubber (NR) blends, which are filled with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are reported. It {{was found that the}} addition of CNTs and the blending with NR significantly enhance the tensile strength of the BIIR composites. The use of butyl imidazole as physical cross-linker for the BIIR phase provides the blend composites the non-covalent bondings, which are responsible for their self-healing properties. Owing to the increase of the viscosity of the BIIR phase upon its physical crosslinking the island-matrix morphology of the blend changes over to a co-continuous structure. The preferential wetting of the CNT surface by the low-loading NR phase in the NR/BIIR blends {{can be explained by the}} good rubber-filler interaction between the linked phospholipids of the NR molecules and the π-electrons of the CNT surface. As a result, the favored localization of the CNTs in the NR phase strongly improves the electrical properties of the blends according to the double percolation theory. On the other hand it does not deteriorate the self-healing of the BIIR phase. The high electrical conductivity provides us a possibility to heat the blend by application of an electrical voltage in order to accelerate the self-healing process...|$|E

40|$|<b>Bromobutyl</b> {{elastomer}} (BIIR) can be {{used for}} sealing medical drug delivery devices due to its high resistance to permeability by moisture and gases which are known to deteriorate the performance of pharmaceutical drugs. However, its use is restricted since the traditional accelerators used for crosslinking BIIR leave reaction residues which can leach out and contaminate drugs. An accelerator based on xanthogen polysulphide (DIXP) does not leave reaction residues as it is totally consumed during crosslinking. From these considerations DIXP was used to formulate a BIIR composition for seals in medical devices. The isothermal kinetic reaction curve for BIIR showed that the crosslinking region consists of two parts. The first part had a reaction order (n) = 1 and the second stage had a lower n = 0. 6 – 0. 7. The rate constants and the activation energies for the two stages were determined. Increasing the time and temperature variables of crosslinking increased the dynamic elastic shear modulus (G′) in BIIR according to the kinetic theory of vulcanization, however the moisture ingress showed an initial decrease followed by an inflection where increasing the variables caused increased moisture ingress. This increase is believed to be caused by the volatile gaseous byproducts produced in the crosslinking reaction of DIXP which change the microstructure of BIIR. The crosslinking conditions for minimizing moisture ingress in BIIR and achieving a high G′ were identified...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} N-functionalized 2 -diphenylphosphinobenzaldimino ligands (3. 1 â 3. 6) bearing pendant {{groups on the}} imine moiety were {{prepared}} by the Schiff-base condensation reaction of 2 -diphenylphosphinibenzaldehyde and appropriate primary amines. The ligands were subsequently used to synthesize a range of palladium complexes of the types [Pd(P^N) Cl 2] (3. 7 â 3. 12) and [Pd(P^N) (Me) Cl) ] (3. 13 â 3. 18) from precursor complexes [Pd(COD) Cl 2] and [Pd(COD) (Me) Cl], respectively. Platinum complexes of the type [Pt(P^N) Cl 2] (3. 19 â 3. 24) were synthesized by the ligand displacement reaction between [Pt(COD) Cl 2] and ligands 3. 1 â 3. 6. All compounds were characterized by multinuclear NMR and infrared spectroscopies as well as elemental analysis. In addition, the structure of complex 3. 14 was determined by x-ray crystallography. Palladium complexes 3. 8 â 3. 10 and 3. 16 were evaluated as pre-catalysts in the Suzuki- Miyaura coupling reaction. These complexes {{were found to be}} highly active and tolerant {{of a wide range of}} reaction conditions and functional groups on substrates. Low catalyst loadings (0. 1 mol% Pd) were required, while high conversions and short reaction times were maintained. Having a substituent bearing a donor atom on the imine moiety of the ligand (ligands 3. 3 and 3. 4) was found to enhance catalytic activity. Palladium methyl chloride complexes were found to show slightly more activity than their palladium dichloride counterparts. Reaction of [Pt(P^N) Cl 2] complexes with BrMg(CH 2) 4 MgBr in an attempt to synthesize platinacycloalkane complexes resulted in the formation of <b>bromobutyl</b> complexes [Pt(P^N) (C 4 H 9) Br] (3. 25 and 3. 26) instead. Successful synthesis of platinacyclopentane complexes, 5. 1 â 5. 6, and platinacycloheptane complexes, 5. 7 â 5. 12, was achieved by the reaction of [Pt(COD) Cl 2] with appropriate di-Grignard reagents, followed by ligand displacement with the iminophosphine ligands. All complexes were fully characterized using various NMR spectroscopies, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. Crystal structures of the <b>bromobutyl</b> and platinacyclopentane complexes 3. 25 and 5. 1 were determined. Studies on the thermal decomposition of the platinacycloalkane complexes were carried out. Platinacyclopentane complexes 5. 1 â 5. 6 were found to be markedly stable, with the decomposition reaction requiring temperatures higher than 100 Â°C. Reaction temperature and duration were found to have a significant influence on the organic product distribution obtained. These reactions gave 1 -butene (for the platinacyclopentane complexes) and 1 - hexene (for the platinacycloheptane complexes) as major products. Kinetic data obtained for the decomposition of 5. 1 and 5. 7 shows that the decomposition reaction follows first order kinetics for the initial 30 % of the decomposition reaction. Thereafter, reaction order deviates from first order behaviour, indicating increasing involvement of products in the reaction mechanism. The generally accepted Î²-hydride elimination/reductive elimination reaction mechanism for the decomposition of metallacycloalkanes was investigated using DFT methods. The simplified complex, 5. 13 B, was used as a model for platinacyclopentane complexes. Results from these calculations show that intramolecular Î²-hydride elimination from the carbocyclic ring of platinacyclopentane complexes is unlikely to occur as this process requires an extremely high energy barrier (> 64 kcal. mol- 1). Furthermore, these calculations reveal that ligand hemilability is energetically disfavoured in the Î²-elimination reaction while it is favoured in the reductive elimination reaction...|$|E
40|$|In Chapter 1 - 3, {{properties}} and applications of block copolymers, synthetic methods especially living anionic polymerization {{as well as}} the development of the SAAP concept with some of previous successful examples are reviewed. Experimental methods, including the design and establishment of a special high-vacuum system, size exclusion chromatography and laser light scattering, are explained. In Chapter 4, living anionic polymerization of alpha,o-di <b>bromobutyl</b> end-capped PI-b-PS-b-PI triblock copolymers and the end-capping reaction with 1, 4 -dibromobutane at the end of polymerization are described, including a in-depth analysis of the reaction mechanism that involves the dimerization of two living oligomer chain during the reaction of living polymeric anions with haloalkanes, i. e., the Wurtz-type coupling reaction. The self assembly and coupling reaction of 1, 4 -dilithio- 1, 1, 4, 4 -tetraphenylbutane (DD 2 -) in n-hexane to form long (PI- b-PS-b-PI) 10 multiblock chains are discussed. The coupling efficiencies with and without the self assembly are compared to demonstrate the principle of SAAP. However, the coupling reaction with dianion linker is troublesome because a trace amount of impurities in the solvent can remove its activity. In Chapter 5, a method of improving the coupling efficiency is described. In this method, PI-b-PS-b-PI triblock copolymers is end-capped with avo-dicarboxylic acid groups via a reaction between living anions and carbon dioxide. Such prepared HOOC-ISI-COOH chains can be coupled with 1, 6 -hexamethylenediamine (HDA) in the presence of 1, 3 -dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) after the self assembly. The size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis shows that the SAAP method mainly leads to the formation of triblock copolymer chain dimers and the coupling efficiency is close to 50 %. There is no coupling in THF without the self assembly. Further, a much better method of using alpha,o-diacyl chloride end-capped PI-b-PS-b-PI triblock copolymer chains in SAAP to prepare long multiblock copolymer chains is described. Using this recently developed method, we are able to prepared long ∼ 90 -block copolymer chains (PI-b-PS-b-PI) 30 which clearly shows the advantage of using SAAP to prepare long multiblock copolymers with a controllable sequence and different block lengths. In this thesis, we have proposed and developed a novel method: The Self-Assembly Assisted Polypolymerization (SAAP). Namely, using the self-assembly of A-B-A triblock copolymers with two active end groups in a selective solvent for the A-block to concentrate and expose the active end groups {{on the periphery of the}} resultant core-shell polymeric micelles, we can effectively couple each two active ends on different chains together to form a long multiblock copolymer chain with its sequence and block length well controlled by the initial triblock copolymer. To accomplish this project, we first built a high-vacuum system for living anionic polymerization and then synthesized and characterized narrowly distributed polyisoprene-b-polystyrene- b-polyisoprene (PI-b-PS-b-PI) triblock copolymer chains with their both ends capped respectively with <b>bromobutyl</b> and carboxylic acid active groups. The self assembly of such prepared triblock copolymers in n-hexane, a selective solvent for PI, was studied by a combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering (LLS). Finally, the self-assembled end-functionalized PI-b-PS-b-PI chains were coupled together by difunctional small molecules (linkers) to form long multiblock copolymers with a controlled structure.

" [...] abstractThe failure of agitator blades was an issue of major concern in the leaching circuit of the Australian Magnesium Corporation (AMC) pilot plant in Gladstone. The aim of this project was to investigate the causes of the failure of the agitator blades and to make some recommendations to help avoid the problem in the future. At the start of this thesis, a comprehensive failure analysis was carried out {{in order to understand the}} potential failure mechanisms operating in the slurry tanks. A number of potential failure mechanisms were identified and these included erosive slurry wear of the rubber and chemical and/or thermal degradation of the rubber. These failure mechanisms may also act synergistically. An experimental programme of research was planned to investigate the separate influences of slurry wear and chemical and/or thermal degradation of the rubber. The results of these tests were then used to extend our understanding of the failure of the agitator blades. A slurry erosion test has been developed in order to quantify the erosion of <b>bromobutyl</b> rubber. The study investigated the effects of particle size, erosion time, slurry weight concentration and specimen velocity. Wear was measured using surface roughness measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the worn surfaces. The degree of wear was found to increase with increased particle size, slurry weight concentration and erosion time and the wear appear to be at a maximum at a nominal angle of impact of the particles of approximately 40 °. Wear appeared to decrease with increasing slurry velocities, but this may have been due to changes in particle shape. One of the key factors in the development of damage on the surface of the rubber was found to be wear of the abrading particles and the condition of the abrading particles needs to be taken into account when interpreting the results of slurry wear tests. In general the experimental results were found to be in good agreement with the predictions from the literature and a model has been developed in order to obtain a better understanding of slurry erosion. In addition to the slurry wear tests, the chemical degradation behaviour of In addition to the slurry wear tests, the chemical degradation behaviour of <b>bromobutyl</b> rubber was investigated by measuring hardness (shore A) and surface morphology of the rubber after exposure of the rubber to acid and water at 70 °C. In acid, the rubber hardness increased with time and whereas in water alone, the rubber hardness decreased. This indicated that the acid immersion had a hardening effect on the rubber and this may have played some part in the failure. From this work, it is apparent that both slurry wear and exposure to acid andlor temperature have an effect on the degradation of the rubber. Particle size and shape had a major effect on damage accumulation rates, with most damage occurring with large, sharp particles. For tests where the particle size was below 3. 35 mm the damage accumulation rate was insignificant. Morphological studies of the worn surfaces suggest that a major mechanism of damage was the formation of cracks which penetrated the rubber and exposed the underlying steel agitator blades to the acidic environment. Hardening of the rubber by exposure to the acid solution would have decreased the resilience of the rubber and may have increased the effect of the slurry wear on crack formation, but at this stage the coupled effects of slurry wear and chemical/thermal degradation have not been explored...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} supramolecular {{chemistry}} has established {{as one of}} the most active fields of science. The most significant feature of supramolecular chemistry is the use of building blocks which reversibly held together by intermolecular forces, electrostatic or H-bonding. Therefore, the synthesis of supramolecular systems using different non-covalent assemblies provides some unique architectures and features which are extremely difficult to be obtained via covalent synthesis. One main application of such influencing supramolecular systems is the preparation of self-healing materials. Among various approaches to self-healing effects, reversible bond formation has become prominent in the last years. To achieve both acceptable mechanical performance and self-healing behaviour from a polymeric material, proper balance between covalent and non-covalent bonding is important. The covalent bonding gives a basic strength to the material while the non-covalent bonding generates self-healing effects in the case of damage. The main aim of this study was to synthesize an organic moiety which is capable of forming supramolecular assemblies in the presence of suitable counterparts, followed by its incorporation on to polymer matrix and investigation of the final properties. For reversible bond forming technique H-bonding is exploited in this work. 4 -substituted- 2, 6 -diaminopyridine is selected as the organic moiety as it has a clear DAD (donor-acceptor-donor) structure and thus able to undergo self-association or triple hydrogen bonded complex formation with respective counterparts. Chichibabin reaction was utilised for the synthesis and 4 -hydroxy- 2, 6 -diamido pyridine was synthesised as the key compound. Initially different derivatives of 4 -hydroxy- 2, 6 diamino pyridine was synthesized and utilised towards the formation of supramolecular network with a suitable monomeric counterpart. Poly (butadiene-co-maleic anhydride) is used as the base polymer as it has the possibility to introduce non-covalent bonding sites through grafting reactions on the double bonds or on maleic anhydride groups. The free amine group present in the main compound was grafted onto the backbone of poly (butadiene-co-maleic anhydride) via reaction of amine with maleic anhydride group. The main design of supramolecular self-assembly within poly (butadiene-co-maleic anhydride) with a suitable counterpart poly (butadiene-co-maleimide), is prepared and used in this thesis. The miscibility of the two polymers is proven by the presence of a single Tg in the DSC results of the mixture and also by the formation of homogeneous films with no phase separation in AFM. However the formation of hydrogen bonding within the monomer was proven by 1 H NMR, IR studies. Further formation of complex between two polymers was established from the results of viscosity. Also the interactions between the complexes exert a distinct influence on the rheological behavior of the blend. Lastly the reversibility of this supramolecular blend was assured by temperature dependent viscosity values. In the final part of this work, <b>bromobutyl</b> rubber (BIIR) is selected as the model elastomer which has vast application in the tire industry; as the inner-liner that holds the air in the tire and also used as rubber stoppers for sealing medicine vials and bottles The bromine functionality can be substituted with an amine group making it more susceptible towards the incorporation of different organic moieties. In this way, the derivative of 2, 6 -diaminopyridine having a pendant amine group is incorporated in BIIR. As a counterpart uracil is used as its H-bond forming ability with diaminopyridine moieties is well established and supported by different previous research works. The supramolecular network formed between these two monomers help to generate self-healing effects within BIIR rubber. Fig. 2 represents the supramolecular network formed between chains of BIIR. The self-healing effect of the rubber material is examined through the stress-strain experiments where up to 82 % healing was observed when heated up to 70 °C. With increasing temperature better healing was observed whereas at room temperature a 40 % healing tendency was noticed. It is also interesting to note that the thermal and dynamic mechanical properties of this tailor made self-healing BIIR is identical with sulphur cured conventional BIIR...|$|E
