The British government ignored the resolutions for over three years until in 1837 it countered the Parti Patriote's requests with ten resolutions of its own, called the Russel Resolutions, while rejecting all proposed ninety-two resolutions made by Papineau and his party. These resolutions allowed the colony governor to obtain <b>budgetary</b> <b>estimates</b> without vote of the assembly, which brought about verbal and physical violence, and eventually led to the Rebellions of 1837. After the rebellions, many patriotes were exiled, hanged, or had their houses set ablaze, which marked the end of the party.

50|$|However, {{construction}} of the 7,804 meter long tunnel proved to be extremely difficult due to numerous unforeseen problems with the local geology and contemporary tunneling technology. The Hakone mountain range is an active volcanic zone, containing a number of faults and is subject to frequent earthquakes. In addition, workers encountered problems with a huge volume of water seepage, soft rock formations, and vents of hot spring water. On April 1, 1920, a large section of the tunnel from the Atami side collapsed, trapping 42 workers, 17 of whom were rescued a week later after heroic efforts to dig them out. The tunnel was also damaged during the Great Kantō earthquake without fatalities; however, another section collapsed during an earthquake on February 26, 1930, killing five more workers. The work took many years more than initially anticipated, and costs far exceeded original <b>budgetary</b> <b>estimates.</b> The total number of workers killed in during construction was 67 men.|$|E

40|$|The Nigeria {{budgetary}} {{practices have}} been characterised with indiscipline and flagrant disregards to budgetary rules and procedures. This {{culture has been}} substantially attributed to the long years of military rule. This paper juxtaposes military and civilian regimes in Nigeria with respect to adherence to <b>budgetary</b> <b>estimates.</b> Eight years for each regime were purposively considered (1991 – 1998 and 1999 - 2006).

The paper found that although budget discipline under democratic regime is arithmetically higher that budget discipline under military system, the difference is not statistically significant. It was therefore recommended that since budget is a law (appropriation Act); it should be accorded the same respect like any other act of the National Assembly as a justification for the democratic tenet {{of the rule of}} law.

40|$|According to {{the theory}} of {{efficient}} markets, economic agents use all available information to form rational expectations. Fiscal marksmanship, the accuracy of budgetary forecasting, can be one important piece of such information the rational agents must consider in forming expectations. Using Theil’s inequality coefficient (U) based on the mean square prediction error, the paper estimates the magnitude of errors in the budgetary forecasts in India for the period 1990 - 91 to 2003 - 04 and also decomposed the errors into biasedness, unequal variation and random components to analyze the source of error. The test of rational expectations revealed that neither revenue nor expenditure forecasts in India is rational. However, capital budget revealed more forecast errors than revenue budget. The results also revealed that degree of errors in forecasting of receipts was relatively higher than that of expenditure. However there is no specific trend in the forecasting errors, which reveals that <b>budgetary</b> <b>estimates</b> are made not based on adaptive expectations. The proportion of error due to random variation has been significantly higher (which is beyond the control of the forecaster), while the errors due to bias has been negligible. The analysis related to efficiency of forecasts also showed that no significant improvement in forecasts over time. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recently the BIM {{concept that}} all {{professionals}} carry out collaborative work among domains and {{departments in the}} industry has attracted more and more attention by research scholars and engineers around the world. The core of the BIM technology is the information sharing and exchanging among the life cycle. In view of this key problem, this article introduces {{the situation of the}} BIM research and development in domestic and overseas, and indicates that there are several common problems existing in the BIM development, such as, the information of multiple projects cannot be stored in a centralized database; the information is lost or incorrect when importing and exporting IFC model files with popular BIM software; the application software based on BIM technology is quite few, etc. The paper points out that the realization of BIM technology shall be based on the BIM database which is based on IFC standard. After that, this paper discusses how to build the BIM database based on IFC standard, the application interface of BIM database, the function of <b>budgetary</b> <b>estimates</b> and the transplantation of structural model conversion to BIM database. Then, a few examples are given to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of the BIM database and corresponding applications developed in this research.

40|$|A {{statement}} of record {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an abstract that begins "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requested and received $ 195 million for Hepatitis C screening and treatment in fiscal year 2000. VA's budget documentation showed that it had spent $ 100 million on Hepatitis C screening and treatment, leaving a difference of $ 95 million between its estimated and actual expenditures. However, GAO's review revealed that the difference was actually much larger [...] $ 145 million. VA's documentation showed that only $ 50 million was used for budgeted activities and $ 50 million was used for an activity not included in its original budget [...] treatment of conditions related to Hepatitis C. It appears that VA is unable to develop a budget estimate that can reliably forecast its Hepatitis C funding needs at this time. However, VA's Veterans Health Administration (VHA) appears to be taking reasonable steps to improve future budget estimates and thereby minimize the potential for large differences. Such steps include developing a Hepatitis C patient registry that could provide the critical data needed to improve <b>budgetary</b> <b>estimates.</b> However, this registry could {{take as long as}} 15 months to become operational, which suggests that it may not provide budgetary data in time to formulate the 2004 budget.

40|$|The role of {{the federal}} budget in public {{finances}} is not straightforward, writes Jenny Stewart WHY DO governments budget? The official answer is that they budget for the same reason {{the rest of us do}} (well, some of us) : to make plans for the future in financial form, and to monitor progress against those plans. In contrast to individuals, and unlike businesses in the private sector, governments make their budgets public. Knowing the numbers helps members of parliament, and citizens, understand what the government plans to do with our money – or at least, that is the theory. In practice, in keeping with the theatrical trimmings that attend their presentation, public sector budgets are as much about political capital as they are about the financial variety. Few readers of the voluminous budget papers will pore over every detail. And even Senate estimates committees, whose members cross-examine public servants about the administrative aspects of their agencies’ <b>budgetary</b> <b>estimates,</b> focus on just a few issues. Budget night gives treasurers a rare opportunity to take centre stage, without a prime minister or premier hanging over their shoulder (or, worse still, upstaging them completely). If the news is bad, they tell it like it is, being careful, of course, to blame the situation on forces beyond their control. Inevitably, there are winners and losers. The winners (always announced first) are linked with the major themes of the budget: the most recent federal budget, awash with anti-recessionary spending, featured nation-building and the fair go. Not surprisingly, the losers receive less attention. In the last budget, they included two disparate groups: higher income earners with private health insurance, and those who will have to wait until they are sixty-seven before they qualify for the pension (which means anyone born after January 1957 – potentially a very large group indeed). Increasingly, though, budget night has a somewhat anti-climactic air about it. Speculation, rather than news, is what keeps the media excited, so budgets are about managing expectations as well as money. Key details will have been issued in advance, so that unpleasant surprises on the night are kept to a minimum. Most of us feared that the most recent federal budget would be horrific – when it actually appeared, it was much milder than we had expected. It would be a serious mistake, though, to place too much store on the numbers put forward on budget night. Programs foreshadowed to commence down the track may never materialise or, where additional or special legislation is required, may be defeated in the Senate. A budget is a financial work-in-progress, not a reality. Even the numbers relating to the budget year itself may be subject to rapid and substantial change, both on the revenue and the expenditure sides. In May, the federal government has a fairly good idea of the fiscal outcome from the soon-to-be completed year. But often there is not much resemblance between that outcome and the one that was projected in the previous year’s budget. This is not because the government is deceiving us. It is because economies are constantly changing and no one, certainly no one in the Treasury, knows what is going to happen. (If they did, they would not be in the Treasury, but making squillions in the private sector.) We might agree that changing economic conditions will affect revenue and expenditures in ways that are hard to predict. But what about the government’s policy-related choices: the new programs it is going to fund, and the old ones it is going to axe? Surely it is reasonable to expect that these will be presented (and projected) accurately in the budget?It is true that the government tells us on budget night about all those policies it knows about. But politics being the business that it is, new policies keep popping up right through the year. And in the lead-up to elections, the spending can become frenetic. In times past, the full implications of these emerging choices were not publicly known until the next budget appeared (accompanied, if the government changed, by much hand-wringing about the ineptitude of the previous lot). At least now (through the Charter of Budget Honesty that the Howard government legislated in 1998) we are told about these new policies and their financial implications when the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook is issued in December. For example, in 2006, in what proved to be the last full year of the Howard government, $ 2 billion worth of new spending was decided upon between May, when the budget was presented, and December, when the Outlook was issued. The Rudd government, not to be outdone, brought in $ 3 billion of new policies in the wake of its first budget. Coincidentally, or perhaps not, these amounts almost exactly balanced the spending opportunities that had arisen because of so-called parameter variations – increases in revenue or decreases in expenditure that occur as a result of unanticipated economic and other changes. Far from being an instrument of longer term planning, the budget is held hostage, not only by politics, but by its role in macroeconomic management. When spending is ramped up in times of recession, and pruned back in times of higher growth, it is difficult to maintain a steady course in relation to public investment, particularly when borrowing is frowned upon (except in emergencies). So we have the spectacle of the government spending up big on infrastructure-related projects in order to stimulate the economy, after years of grimly accumulating surpluses. At the same time, when more money comes in than was expected (as was the case before the financial crisis hit) the temptation to spend it on politically favourable projects is almost overwhelming. All this is made possible by the glorious flexibility that budgets provide. Provided that spending is properly authorised (that is, there is an appropriation for it), governments do not have to abide by their budgetary intentions. Indeed, there is no formal requirement for them to have a budget at all. So, what is all the fuss about? Why the enormous effort to produce budget papers that go into the most minute detail of agency activity? Twenty years ago the Commonwealth budget papers numbered a mere 600 pages. Now they are 10, 000 and growing. Much of this additional documentation is directed towards making it clearer at agency level how much money is being spent, on what, and to what effect. The idea was to enhance both the managerial capacity and the accountability of government. Both objectives have proved elusive. It is a bit hard to manage well when your financial parameters fluctuate wildly from one year to the next. Accountability for results becomes problematic as well. How can public servants be held responsible for outcomes when their power to influence them is so qualified? Perhaps this is why, after years of requiring agencies to report their spending in terms of outputs (that is, the impacts or effects of their activities), in the most recent budget departments are obliged, once again, to report on the basis of the actual programs for which appropriations are made. So, after almost a decade of continuous change, we are now going back (sort of) to the situation that obtained from roughly the early to the late- 1990 s, when agencies produced program-based budget statements. These were much easier to use and to understand than the more elaborate and ambitious productions that succeeded them, so the hardy tribe of budget-paper aficionados will be pleased. Has all the effort that has gone into improving the way government finances are reported upon been worth it? It seems to me that, as they labour unremittingly to achieve perfection in budget-related reporting, the Finance people are a little like librarians who agonise endlessly over the perfect bibliographic description of a new book, when all the users want to know is where to find it. •Jenny Stewart is Associate Professor of Public Policy at the University of Canberra.
