Other ports include the Amiga, Apple II, Atari 7800, Intellivision, Commodore 64, Commodore VIC-20, Famicom Disk System, IBM PC <b>booter,</b> ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, Atari 8-bit family and Mini-Arcade versions. The game was ported to Nintendo's Family Computer (Famicom) console in 1983 {{as one of}} the system's three launch titles; the same version was an early title for the Famicom's North American version, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). However, the cement factory level is not included, nor are most of the cutscenes since Nintendo did not have large enough cartridge ROMs available in the beginning. This port includes a new song composed by Yukio Kaneoka for the title screen; an arrangement of the tune appears in Donkey Kong Country for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Both Donkey Kong and its sequel, Donkey Kong Jr., are included in the 1988 NES compilation Donkey Kong Classics. The NES version was re-released as an unlockable game in Animal Crossing for the GameCube and as an item for purchase on the Virtual Console for the Wii, Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. The Wii U version is also the last game that was released to celebrate the 30-year anniversary of the Japanese version of the NES, the Famicom. The original arcade version of the game appears in the Nintendo 64 game Donkey Kong 64. Nintendo released the NES version on the e-Reader and for the Game Boy Advance Classic NES series in 2002 and 2004, respectively. The Famicom version of the game sold 840,000 units in Japan.|$|E

50|$|The Lady Blue <b>Booters</b> {{also hold}} a record, {{although}} {{something that they}} cannot boast. They have not won a championship in the UAAP and were even the doormat team in Season 74 (2011-12) as they did not win a single game. However, these losing seasons may become {{a thing of the}} past. For Season 75 (2012-12), the Lady Blue <b>Booters</b> have three national players in their roster. In the 2012 national University Games, a preseason tournament that is held during the academic semestral break in October that the Lady Blue <b>Booters</b> join annually, they finished as runner-up. The Finals was a tightly fought game which went into a 10-10 silver goal overtime (full 20 minutes). The final score was 1-0 and the winning goal was scored by their opponent only at the last five minutes of overtime. The following year, the Lady Blue <b>Booters</b> won the championship of the 2013 Philippine National Games held in May 2013. In Season 75 (2012-13), the Blue <b>Booters</b> topped the elimination round which gave them the top seed in the Final 4 and a twice-to-beat advantage. The Blue <b>Booters</b> did not have to use this advantage as they defeated La Salle, their Final 4 opponent, 4 - 3, in a penalty shoot-out in game one to advance to the Finals {{for the first time in}} six years. In the Finals, the Blue <b>Booters</b> swept defending champion UP in their best-of-three series, to win their sixth UAAP championship. Season 75 was a penalty shoot-out season for the Blue <b>Booters.</b> They won all their games in the Final 4 and Finals via penalty shoot-outs.|$|R
40|$|In 2012, the Dutch National Research and Education Network, SURFnet, {{observed}} {{a multitude of}} Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against educational institutions. These attacks were effective enough to cause the online exams of hundreds of students to be cancelled. Surprisingly, these attacks were purchased by students from websites, known as <b>Booters.</b> These sites provide DDoS attacks as a paid service (DDoS-as-a-Service) at costs starting from 1 USD. Since this problem was first identified by SURFnet, <b>Booters</b> have been used repeatedly to perform attacks on schools in SURFnet's constituency. Very little is known, however, about the characteristics of <b>Booters,</b> and particularly how their attacks are structure. This is vital information needed to mitigate these attacks. In this paper we analyse the characteristics of 14 distinct <b>Booters</b> based on more than 250 GB of network data from real attacks. Our findings show that <b>Booters</b> pose a real threat {{that should not be}} underestimated, especially since our analysis suggests that they can easily increase their firepower based on their current infrastructure...|$|R
