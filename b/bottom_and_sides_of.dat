25|$|When {{refrigeration}} {{first arrived}} (the 19th century) the equipment was initially used to cool cans of milk, which were filled by hand milking. These cans were placed into a cooled water bath {{to remove heat}} and keep them cool until {{they were able to}} be transported to a collection facility. As more automated methods were developed for harvesting milk, hand milking was replaced and, as a result, the milk can was replaced by a bulk milk cooler. 'Ice banks' were the first type of bulk milk cooler. This was a double wall vessel with evaporator coils and water located between the walls at the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the tank. A small refrigeration compressor was used to remove heat from the evaporator coils. Ice eventually builds up around the coils, until it reaches a thickness of about three inches surrounding each pipe, and the cooling system shuts off. When the milking operation starts, only the milk agitator and the water circulation pump, which flows water across the ice and the steel walls of the tank, are needed to reduce the incoming milk to a temperature below 5 degrees.|$|E
500|$|Underwire bras {{are built}} with a {{semi-circular}} [...] "underwire", [...] "bra wire", or [...] "wire" [...] {{embedded in the}} wire channel that circles the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> each cup. One end, or head element, of the underwire {{is close to the}} front and center of the bra, and the other close to the armhole. The underwire can be made of metal or molded plastic; most are metallic. Plastic underwire has a very small share of the market because it does not provide the same support and rigidity offered by metal underwire. A metallic underwire is a thin strip of metal, usually with a nylon coating at both ends.|$|E
500|$|The underwire bra design {{emerged and}} took {{hold in the}} United States {{starting}} in the 1930s. Helene Pons received a patent in 1931 for a brassiere design that incorporated an [...] "open-ended wire loop" [...] that laid flat against the chest, encircling the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> each breast. A 1932 patent describes a U-shaped piece of wire used between the cups to keep the breasts separated. A patent issued in 1938 to Pauline Boris describes a [...] "breast support" [...] which used pieces of wire to entirely encircle each breast. In 1940, Walter Emmett Williams was issued a patent which described a wire framework, shaped like a spiderweb, that encircles and covers each breast to provide support. Although development of the underwire bra started in the 1930s, it did not gain widespread popularity until the 1950s, when the end of World War II freed metal for domestic use.|$|E

25|$|In 1708, Charles Perry {{suggested}} copper sheathing explicitly as an anti-fouling device but {{the first}} experiments were not made until 1761 with the sheathing of HMS Alarm, after which the <b>bottoms</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> several ships' keels and false keels were sheathed with copper plates.|$|R
50|$|The use {{of copper}} {{sheathing}} was first suggested by Charles Perry in 1708, {{though it was}} rejected by the Navy Board on grounds of high cost and perceived maintenance difficulties.

2500|$|Dried eggs of Triops longicaudatus {{are sold}} in kits to be raised as {{aquarium}} pets, sold {{under the name of}} [...] "aquasaurs", [...] "trigons" [...] or [...] "triops". These are most often of the greenish-brown variety, but the red variant is fairly common among enthusiasts. Captive Triops are frequently kept in aquariums and fed a diet consisting mainly of carrots, shrimp pellets and dried shrimp. Often they are also given living shrimp and daphnia as live prey. Because they can feed on just about anything, they are also fed lunch meat, potatoes, crackers, etc. They will often feed themselves by grazing on algae and other grunge from the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the tank and on small particles clinging to sponge filters or to Marimo moss balls, which are often cultured alongside Triops.|$|E
60|$|Then {{they began}} to tow at an average speed of four knots an hour. The Haliotis {{was very hard to}} move, and the gunnery-lieutenant, who had fired the five-inch shell, had leisure to think upon consequences. Mr. Wardrop was the busy man. He {{borrowed}} all the crew to shore up the cylinders with spars and blocks from the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the ship. It was a day's risky work; but anything was better than drowning {{at the end of a}} tow-rope; and if the forward cylinder had fallen, it would have made its way to the sea-bed, and taken the Haliotis after.|$|E
60|$|There were fifty {{at least}} of the {{magnificent}} animals scattered in groups over the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a valley about three miles in extent; some were browsing on the succulent spekboom, {{of which they are}} very fond. Others were digging up and feeding among the young mimosa-thorns and evergreens. The place where the hunters stood was not suitable for an attack. It was therefore resolved to move round to a better position. As they advanced some of the groups of elephants came more distinctly into view, but they seemed either not to observe, or to disregard, the intruders.|$|E
5000|$|The splendid darter is a benthopelagic {{fish that}} {{occupies}} a freshwater habitat [...] Research {{has not yet}} revealed the specific dieting habits, competitors, or predators of this darter, but studies of other darter species indicate the splendid darter is likely insectivorous and at times consumed by larger predatory fish.

25|$|Other {{exterior}} injuries include cuts {{caused by}} toenails piercing adjacent toes. This {{can be prevented}} by keeping toe nails cut short and filed smooth. Also, calluses may form on the <b>bottoms</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the feet, which can crack open. This can be helped {{by the use of}} gel pad protectors on specific problem spots or using pads to surround the toes. Ingrown nails can result from ill-fitting shoes.|$|R
30|$|Since {{bacteria}} form biofilms on the <b>bottoms</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> plates, confocal laser microscopy {{was used}} to observe biofilm formation on the bottoms of 96 -well polystyrene plates. In-line with our quantitative data, 5 -iodoindole at 0.2  mM (1 / 10 of MIC) dramatically inhibited biofilm formation by E. coli and S. aureus (Fig.  4 d, e). Also, relative amounts of biofilm formation by E. coli and S. aureus confirmed that S. aureus 6538 produced markedly more biofilm than E. coli BW 25113 under the same conditions.|$|R

60|$|The {{peculiar}} {{quality of}} this light, which gave it its great preeminence over all other penetrating rays, was the power it possessed of illuminating an object; passing through it; rendering it transparent and invisible; illuminating the opaque substance it next met in its path, and afterwards rendering that transparent. If {{the rocks and}} earth in the cylindrical cavities of light which Clewe had already produced in his experiments had actually been removed with pickaxes and shovels, the lighted hole a few feet in depth could not have appeared more real, the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the little well {{could not have been}} revealed more sharply and distinctly; and yet there was no hole in the ground, and if one should try to put his foot into the lighted perforation he would find it as solid as any other part of the earth.|$|E
6000|$|The {{architecture}} of Pope's Temple and Chaucer's House presents the same difference which distinguishes the respective poems throughout. The House {{is in the}} magnificent Gothic of the time, with its multiplied buttresses, niches, images, pinnacles, and traceried windows. The Temple is a building which resembles nothing that ever existed. One face is Grecian architecture, a second Eastern, a third Egyptian, and a fourth Northern. Warton, in a note to the poem, says that Pope's [...] "knowledge and taste in the fine arts were unquestionable." [...] Had he possessed the crudest ideas of architecture {{he could not have}} affirmed that so hideous, and indeed so impossible a combination, surpassed in beauty whatever had been [...] "beheld in proud Rome, or artful Greece, or elder Babylon." [...] The details are worthy of the general conception. The northern side is said to be [...] "of Gothic structure,"--not the glorious style which commonly bears the name, a style for which Pope had no eyes, since with Chaucer's description before him he ignores the mediæval Gothic altogether, but a structure lustrous as glass, and [...] "overwrought with ornaments of barbarous pride." [...] "Huge colosses rise" [...] upon its face, and around the statues are [...] "engraved Runic characters." [...] This part of the design appears to be an importation from the south. In the Egyptian temples colossal figures are often attached to the piers, and at the top, <b>bottom,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the piers there is a border of hieroglyphics. With his statues Pope has conjoined [...] "rude iron columns smeared with blood" [...] upon which stand the [...] "horrid forms of Scythian heroes," [...] and in a note he gravely asserts that this medley [...] "is agreeable to the {{architecture of}} {{the northern part of the}} world." [...] In the text he has ventured upon the no less extraordinary statement that all the façades were of [...] "equal grace" [...] or in other words that his barbarous and chimerical northern side was of equal grace with the architecture of Greece.|$|E
50|$|Calcium {{bicarbonate}} {{is carried}} {{into the cave}} by drips of water. When the slightly pressurized calcium bicarbonate hits {{the air of the}} cave, the carbon dioxide is released, and the calcium carbonate precipitates out of the water.

Other minerals are brought into the cave by flowing of water to create white, red, tan, and gray colors on the formations and walls.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{three-dimensional}} computational {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model was {{used to calculate the}} velocity distribution among multiple parallel microchannels with triangle manifolds. The influences of structural parameters on velocity distribution among microchannels were analyzed. The simulation results showed that the velocity distribution became more uniform with larger microchannel length, depth or smaller width. Larger horizontal ordinate, longitudinal ordinate and radius of inlet/outlet, smaller lengths <b>of</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> symmetrical manifolds could favor obtaining narrow velocity distribution among microchannels. Symmetrical manifold structure could achieve more uniform velocity distribution among microchannels than that asymmetrical manifold structure.
