Jim has learned the company's financial situation from Pam, but feigns uncertainty when asked if Michael is likely to <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> buyout. At David and Charles's orders, Jim brings {{the idea of a}} buyout to Michael. While there he also reassures Michael that Dunder Mifflin is unaware of his company's financial situation. Dwight learns from a past client that Michael has been begging customers for more money and informs Charles, but Charles refuses to listen, having been embarrassed by Dwight's earlier ideas.|$|E
5|$|After Roosevelt's {{death and}} Truman's {{succession}} to the Presidency, Minton continued offering {{advice to the}} new administration {{on a range of}} topics, including patronage and political maneuvering. Truman appointed Minton as head of the War Department Clemency Board, a panel of judges charged with overseeing reviews of decisions made by the courts-martial. The panel met every two weeks which, along with his responsibilities on the circuit court, kept Minton very busy and afforded him little rest, leading to a deterioration in his health. While yachting with President Truman on Memorial Day in 1945, Truman asked Minton to accept an appointment to the position of Solicitor General of the United States. Minton declined because of his health, but he told Truman he would <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> seat on the Supreme Court.|$|E

25|$|Citing {{the global}} {{recession}} {{that began in}} the latter half of 2008, the Kuwaiti government scuttled the K-Dow partnership on December 28, 2008. The collapse of the deal dealt a blow to Dow CEO Andrew Liveris' vision of restructuring the company to make it less cyclical. However, on January 6, 2009 Dow Chemical announced they were in talks with other parties who could <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> major joint venture with the company. Dow also announced they that it would be seeking to recover damages related to the failed joint venture from PIC.|$|E
25|$|In October 1946, Stanley {{approached}} fur-dealer Cyril Ross, {{the common}} acquaintance from the Manchester train, {{with a business}} proposition. Ross {{said that he would}} <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> multiple store such as J.Jones of Manchester. Stanley agreed to pursue the matter and also to get permission for floatation as a public company from the Capital Issues Committee. Stanley, somewhat prematurely, offered a directorship in J.Jones to Gibson who, owing to his position, turned it down. Ross had originally intended that Stanley would be remunerated by equity in the new company but he ultimately lost trust, largely because of the extortionate expenses that Stanley regularly claimed, and agreed only to a fee for the work.|$|E

25|$|Her sister {{liked the}} book and {{encouraged}} Meyer to send the manuscript to literary agencies. Of the 15 letters she wrote, five went unanswered, nine brought rejections, and the last was a positive response from Jodi Reamer of Writers House. Meyer had merely sent out letters to literary agents inquiring if they would <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 130,000-word manuscript about teenage vampires. Luck helped. An inexperienced assistant at Writers House responded to her inquiry, not knowing that young adult books {{are expected to be}} about 40,000 to 60,000 words in length. Due to that error, Reamer eventually read Meyer's manuscript and signed her up as a client. During the editing process, a chapter that used to be Chapter 20 was cut out of the manuscript along with Emmett's account of his bear attack and some parts of the epilogue.|$|E
25|$|Partly as {{a result}} of these failures, and those of other English commanders at this period, John was one of the first {{important}} figures in England to conclude that the war with France was unwinnable because of France's greater resources of wealth and manpower. He began to advocate peace negotiations; indeed, as early as 1373, during his great raid through France, he made contact with , brother and political adviser of Pope Gregory XI, to let the pope know he would <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> diplomatic conference under papal auspices. This approach led indirectly to the Anglo-French Congress of Bruges in 1374–77, which resulted in the short-lived Truce of Bruges between the two sides. John was himself a delegate to the various conferences that eventually resulted in the Truce of Leulinghem in 1389. The fact that he became identified with the attempts to make peace added to his unpopularity at a period when the majority of Englishmen believed victory would be in their grasp if only the French could be defeated decisively as they had been in the 1350s. Another motive was John's conviction that it was only by making peace with France would it be possible to release sufficient manpower to enforce his claim to the throne of Castile.|$|E
25|$|The first film's major {{cast members}} signed on for two sequels {{as part of}} their {{original}} deals. In 2014, early in the film's development, William Shatner said that he was contacted by producer Abrams to see if he would <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> possible role, but as the process continued and the script changed hands, the role never materialized. Alice Eve {{was not included in the}} film despite her character having joined the Enterprise crew at the end of the last installment, because Pegg, in writing the script, did not have anything meaningful for her to do; however, he stressed that Eve could appear in a later installment. Joseph Gatt's cyborg Science Officer 0718 was dropped from the film after a rewrite. In March 2015, Idris Elba was in early talks to play the villain, and he was confirmed for the role in the following months. Pegg noted that the villain would be an original one, rather than a known antagonist from past stories in the Star Trek franchise. In April, Sofia Boutella joined the cast in a lead role, and in early July, Deep Roy was confirmed to reprise his role of Keenser. That month, Joe Taslim was added to the cast opposite Elba's villain, and by August, Lydia Wilson joined as well. In March 2016, Shohreh Aghdashloo was cast as Admiral Paris for reshoots on the film.|$|E

500|$|Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Yancey met on February 18, 1861, as Davis was {{starting}} {{to put together the}} executive branch of the government. [...] Yancey turned down a cabinet position, but indicated he would <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> diplomatic post. Don Doyle argues that Davis displayed [...] "tone deafness" [...] in appointing Yancey, who was [...] "ignorant of the world" [...] and himself realized that he was [...] "wholly unsuited by experience and personality for diplomacy." [...] However, Davis feared that Yancey would be a political opponent, and wanted him out of the country.|$|E
500|$|Later during January 2013, Solis {{confirmed}} {{her interest}} in the County Board of Supervisors race, saying [...] "I'm {{going to take a}} look at it." [...] In explaining why a former U.S. Representative and Cabinet member would <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> county-level body, analysts stated that the board is the most powerful county-level legislative body in the United States, and exercises some executive and quasi-judicial powers as well. [...] It controls a workforce larger than the Labor Department's and its $26 billion budget is equivalent to that of an average U.S. state. Each member presiding over some two million constituents, three times that of Solis' old congressional district, and that it is quite possibly the fourth most powerful position in California politics, after Governor, U.S. Senator, and Mayor of Los Angeles.

[...] Actress June Lockhart, who had appeared in the second of MGM's popular Lassie films (Son of Lassie), had been considered for the role of Ruth Martin before Leachman was signed. [...] Lockhart however was working in New York at the time and declined the role. [...] Eight months later, she had moved back to California and was working on both coasts.

500|$|Ray's {{work has}} been {{described}} as full of humanism and universality, and of a deceptive simplicity with deep underlying complexity. The Japanese director Akira Kurosawa said, [...] "Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon." [...] But his detractors find his films glacially slow, moving like a [...] "majestic snail." [...] Some find his humanism simple-minded, and his work anti-modern; they criticize him for lacking the new modes of expression or experimentation found in works of Ray's contemporaries, such as Jean-Luc Godard. As Stanley Kauffman wrote, some critics believe that Ray assumes that viewers [...] "can <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> film that simply dwells in its characters, rather than one that imposes dramatic patterns on their lives." [...] Ray said he could do nothing about the slow pace. Kurosawa defended him by saying that Ray's films were not slow, [...] "His work can be described as flowing composedly, like a big river".|$|E
500|$|In 1990, the {{managing}} director of London Weekend Television (LWT), Greg Dyke, met with {{the representatives of the}} [...] "big five" [...] football clubs in England (Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham, Everton and Arsenal) over a dinner. [...] The meeting was {{to pave the way for}} a break away from The Football League. Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> larger share of television rights money. The five clubs decided it was a good idea and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of The Football Association and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not enjoy an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it as a way to weaken the Football League's position.|$|E
500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1966, Cooney hosted what she called [...] "a little dinner party" [...] at her {{apartment}} near Gramercy Park. [...] In attendance was her husband Tim Cooney, her boss Lewis Freedman, and Lloyd and Mary Morrisett, whom the Cooneys knew socially. [...] Lloyd Morrisett was a mid-level executive at [...] Carnegie Corporation (who later became its CEO), and was then responsible for funding educational research. The conversation turned to the possibilities of using television to educate young children; Morrisett raised the question, [...] "Do you think television {{could be used to}} teach young children?" [...] Cooney replied, [...] "I don't know, but I'd like to talk about it." [...] According to Davis, the party was the start of a five-decade long professional relationship between Cooney and Morrisett. [...] A week later, Cooney and Freedman met with Morrisett at the offices of Carnegie Corporation to discuss doing a feasibility study on creating an educational television program for preschoolers. [...] Freedman was opposed to Cooney's involvement because he did not think she would <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> project that focused on children and because {{he did not want to}} lose her at WNDT, but she was chosen to do the study.|$|E

Sleep had been touring in Europe with Cathedral and in the United States with Hawkwind in support of Sleep's Holy Mountain when the group felt they had to write new material. The new album {{was going to be an}} hour-long song. This song was written and practiced at sound checks, motel rooms and in friends' houses. Matt Pike said the songwriting process was long and that they were [...] "working on [...] for like four years. We also had two other songs that were working on that were really long, too—like 15 and 20 minutes. But we never recorded them." [...] Al Cisneros stated that smoking cannabis was important to the song's creative process: [...] "I was really dependent on the space I got into when I was using it, and some of the lyrics are about that...The line, 'Drop out of life ,' was kind of a creed at that point." [...] The song was originally known and performed live under the title [...] "Dopesmoker". After their tour, the group began to <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Middle Eastern desert theme which led to Sleep referring to the song as [...] "Jerusalem" [...] during later practice sessions.|$|E
