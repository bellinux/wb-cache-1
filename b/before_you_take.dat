500|$|Daniels {{estimated}} {{the total cost}} of the writing camp to be approximately $200,000, averaging $18,000 for each of the eleven songs which were included on Loud; the camp consisted of forty writers and producers. Daniels confirmed that Rock City received $15,000 and Sham $20,000 for their part in the production of [...] "Man Down". He said that [...] "to get that twelve minutes of inspiration from a top songwriting team is expensive â€” even <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> into account the fee for the songwriters". A cost of $53,000 for [...] "Man Down" [...] was already incurred prior to Rihanna entering the studio with a vocal producer. Although Makeba Riddick did not serve as the song's vocal producer, Daniels cited her {{as an example of how}} the process works and how much she would charge. It is the responsibility of the vocal producer to tell a singer how to sing the song correctly to achieve the desired sound. Daniels said that Riddick's fee varies from $10,000 to $15,000, and that the final part of the process is for the song to be mixed and mastered, which incurs a similar fee. He {{estimated the}} final cost of writing, producing, vocal producing, mixing and mastering [...] "Man Down" [...] to be $78,000. When combined with the marketing and promotional costs, the total expense was $1,078,000.|$|E
