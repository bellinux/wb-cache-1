The Ottoman fleet, commanded by Hobart Pasha, was vastly superior to the Russian Black Sea Fleet; the only ironclads the Russians possessed there were [...] and , circular vessels that had proved to be useless in service. The presence of the fleet did force the Russians to keep two corps in reserve for coastal defense, but the Ottoman high command failed to make use of its naval superiority in a more meaningful way, particularly to hinder the Russian advance into the Balkans. Hobart Pasha took the fleet to the western Black Sea, where he was able to make a more aggressive use of it to support the Ottoman forces battling the Russians in the Caucasus. The fleet bombarded Poti and assisted in the defense of Batumi.|$|E

40|$|There are two {{porpoise}} {{stocks in}} the northern Black Sea: the north-western (Odessa Gulf) and northeastern (Crimean and Caucasian waters); in addition, another stock is in the Sea of Azov. The Azov porpoises are distinct in their body size and biology. This research {{was conducted on the}} skulls of stranded sexually mature porpoises from the north-eastern <b>Black</b> <b>Sea,</b> north-western <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> and the Sea of Azov. In the north-eastern <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> samples, both present-day and old-time, the sexual dimorphism of the skull size was not significant, whereas in the Sea of Azov the females were significantly larger than males. The Azov skulls were strongly different from those from the Black Sea: they were larger, proportionally wider and had the wider rostra; also, there was no significant chronological variation within the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea.</b> The Azov and <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> samples were classified with the 100 % success with four variables. The northwestern <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> skulls were somewhat intermediate in their characteristics between the Azov and northeastern <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> samples, but they were classify ed together with other <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> specimens. The difference between the Azov and <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> skulls was greater than between many North Atlantic populations, despite the extreme geographical proximity of the two stocks. The low variation within the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> supports the earlier conclusions on the lack of genetic variation: all the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> stocks are expected to be genetically similar sub-populations, whereas the Azov and Marmara stocks possibly represent the genetically distant populations. The porpoises from the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> and the Sea of Azov equally show the traits which characterize the subspecies Phocoena phocoena relicta, but the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> porpoises appear to be more paedomorphic in terms of ontogenetic trajectories...|$|R

There is growing international concern about pollution in the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> and other anthropogenic threats to its fauna. The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is one of three species of cetaceans living in the Azov-Black Sea basin. Despite considerable research on bottlenose dolphins elsewhere, the extent of human impacts on the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> populations is unknown.

As in a previous study, we found the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> population to be genetically distinct, with relatively low levels of mtDNA diversity.

Here, SeaWiFS chlorophyll a (chl a), a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, is used to investigate spatio-temporal patterns in <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> phytoplankton dynamics and to explore the potential role of climate in the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea's</b> recovery. Maps of chl a anomalies, calculated relative to the 8  year mean, emphasize spatial and temporal variability of phytoplankton biomass in the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea,</b> particularly between the riverine-influenced Northwest Shelf and the open <b>Black</b> <b>Sea.</b> Evolution of phytoplankton biomass has shown significant spatial variability of persistence of optimal bloom conditions between three major regions of the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea.</b> With the exception of 2001, chl a has generally decreased during our 8  year time-series. However, the winter of 2000 - 2001 was anomalously warm with low wind stress, resulting in reduced vertical mixing of the water column and retention of nutrients in the photic zone. These conditions were associated with anomalously high levels of chl a throughout much of the open <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> during the following spring and summer. The unusual climatic conditions occurring in 2001 may have triggered a shift in the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea's</b> chl a regime.
