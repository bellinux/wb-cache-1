5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} <b>barley</b> <b>malt</b> as {{the majority}} of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no <b>barley</b> <b>malt,</b> for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.|$|E
5|$|Guinness Flavour Extract, a dehydrated, {{hopped wort}} extract made from <b>barley</b> <b>malt</b> and roasted barley, {{is used for}} {{overseas}} production of the stout.

5|$|Guinness Flavour Extract, a dehydrated, {{hopped wort}} extract made from <b>barley</b> <b>malt</b> and roasted barley, {{is used for}} {{overseas}} production of the stout. The syrup is shipped from Ireland, where it is added at the ratio of 1:49 to locally brewed pale beer. Each year, six million litres of GFE are made using 9,000 tonnes of barley. Guinness Flavour Extract was first created by scientists working for the company in the early 1960s. In 2003, production of GFE was relocated from St James's Gate to the former Cherry's brewery in Mary Street, Waterford, but in 2013 production returned to St James's.|$|E

25|$|At {{its most}} basic, {{traditional}} bagel dough contains wheat flour (without germ or bran), salt, water, and yeast leavening. Bread flour or other high gluten flours are preferred {{to create the}} firm, dense but spongy bagel shape and chewy texture. Most bagel recipes call for {{the addition of a}} sweetener to the dough, often <b>barley</b> <b>malt</b> (syrup or crystals), honey, high fructose corn syrup, sugar, with or without eggs, milk or butter. Leavening can be accomplished using a sourdough technique or a commercially produced yeast.|$|E

25|$|Some live {{seeds are}} dormant and need more time, and/or {{need to be}} {{subjected}} to specific environmental conditions before they will germinate. Seed dormancy can originate {{in different parts of the}} seed, for example, within the embryo; in other cases the seed coat is involved. Dormancy breaking often involves changes in membranes, initiated by dormancy-breaking signals. This generally occurs only within hydrated seeds. Factors affecting seed dormancy include the presence of certain plant hormones, notably abscisic acid, which inhibits germination, and gibberellin, which ends seed dormancy. In brewing, barley seeds are treated with gibberellin to ensure uniform seed germination for the production of <b>barley</b> <b>malt.</b>|$|E
25|$|The beer is {{generally}} brewed from a grist containing approximately 60–70% <b>barley</b> <b>malt</b> and 30–40% unmalted wheat. The wort is cooled overnight in a shallow, flat metal pan called a coolship {{where it is}} left exposed to the open air so microorganisms may inoculate the wort. While this cooling method of open air exposure is a critical feature of the style, the key yeasts and bacteria that perform the fermentation reside within the breweries' timber fermenting vessels. Over eighty microorganisms {{have been identified in}} lambic beer, the most significant being Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces pastorianus and Brettanomyces bruxellensis. The process {{is generally}} only possible between October and May as in the summer months there are too many unfavourable organisms in the air that could spoil the beer.|$|E
25|$|Documented {{evidence}} and recently excavated tombs {{indicate that the}} Chinese brewed alcoholic beverages from both malted grain and grain converted by mold from prehistoric times, but that the malt conversion process was largely considered inefficient {{in comparison with the}} use of molds specially cultivated on rice carrier (the resulting molded rice being called 酒麴 (Jiǔ qū) in Chinese and Koji in Japanese) to convert cooked rice into fermentable sugars, both in the amount of resulting fermentable sugars and the residual by products (the Chinese use the dregs left after fermenting the rice, called 酒糟 (Jiǔzāo), as a cooking ingredient in many dishes, frequently as an ingredient to sauces where Western dishes would use wine), because the rice undergoes starch conversion after being hulled and cooked, rather than whole and in husks like <b>barley</b> <b>malt.</b> Furthermore, the hop plant being unknown in East Asia, malt-based alcoholic beverages did not preserve well over time, and the use of malt in the production of alcoholic beverages gradually fell out of favor in China until disappearing from Chinese history {{by the end of the}} Tang Dynasty. The use of rice became dominant, such that wines from fruits of any type were historically all but unknown except as imports in China.|$|E

A strain of yeast used {{since the end}} of Prohibition is added to a tank with the grains to create what is known as [...] "dona yeast", used later in the fermentation process. Hammer mills grind the mix of corn, rye and <b>barley</b> <b>malt</b> to break it down for easier cooking. The mix is then moved into a large mash cooker where water and set back are added. The [...] "set back" [...] is a portion of the old mash from the previous distillation—the key step of the sour mash process, ensuring consistency from batch to batch.|$|E
50|$|During mashing, the {{coarsely}} ground <b>barley</b> <b>malt</b> {{is subjected to}} hydration with water at different temperature-time regimes, which helps in a slow break down of starch molecules into simple carbohydrates, bringing in the balanced combination of carbohydrates and proteins. In the lautering stage, all the soluble solids from the <b>barley</b> <b>malt</b> are extracted avoiding harsh and astringent components from the <b>barley</b> <b>malt</b> husk, leaving behind wort. The extracted wort is boiled along with hops which adds a hoppy aroma and bitter taste to the malt extract. The malt extract is stabilized and sterilised during boiling.|$|E
