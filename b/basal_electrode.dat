40|$|Introduction Neural {{response}} telemetry (NRT) is {{a method}} of capturing the action potential of the distal portion of the auditory nerve in cochlear implant (CI) users, using the CI itself to elicit and record the answers. In addition, it can alsomeasure the recovery function of the auditory nerve (REC), that is, the refractory properties of the nerve. It is not clear in the literature whether the responses from adults {{are the same as}} those from children. Objective To compare the results of NRT and REC between adults and children undergoing CI surgery. Methods Cross-sectional, descriptive, and retrospective study of the results of NRT and REC for patients undergoing IC at our service. The NRT is assessed by the level of amplitude (microvolts) and REC as a function of three parameters: A (saturation level, in microvolts), t 0 (absolute refractory period, in seconds), and tau (curve of the model function), measured in three electrodes (apical, medial, and basal). Results Fifty-two patients were evaluated with intraoperative NRT (26 adults and 26 children), and 24 with REC (12 adults and 12 children). No statistically significant difference was found between intraoperative responses of adults and children for NRTor for REC's three parameters, except for parameter A of the <b>basal</b> <b>electrode.</b> Conclusion The results of intraoperative NRT and REC were not different between adults and children, except for parameter A of the <b>basal</b> <b>electrode...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} investigated the effects of asymmetric current waveforms on the perception of place and temporal pitch cues. The asymmetric waveforms were trains of pseudomonophasic (PS) pulses consisting of a short, high-amplitude phase followed by a longer (and lower amplitude) opposite-polarity phase. When such pulses were presented in a narrow bipolar (“BP+ 1 ”) mode and with the first phase anodic relative to the most apical electrode (so-called PSA pulses), pitch was lower than when the first phase was anodic re the more <b>basal</b> <b>electrode.</b> For a pulse rate of 12 pulses per second (pps), pitch was also lower than with standard symmetric biphasic pulses in either monopolar or bipolar mode.

Sensitivity to interaural timing difference (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD) cues was measured at basal, middle, and apical pitch-matched places of stimulation along the cochlear arrays, using a stimulation rate of 100 Hz. Results {{show that there is}} a trend for people whose onset of deafness occurred during adult life or late childhood to retain at least some sensitivity to ITDs, whereas people with onset of deafness earlier in life were insensitive to ITDs.

40|$|Electrode-place {{discrimination}} {{was measured}} {{in a group of}} children implanted with the Cochlear Limited multiple-electrode prosthesis. An adaptive technique was used to obtain difference Iimens (DLs) for electrodes at the apical, mid, and basal positions on the array. The influence of loudness cues were minimised by randomly varying the electric stimulation levels. Most DLs for the three positions were less than 3 electrodes, although for some subjects limens were as large as 7 electrodes. The relationships between electrode DLs and subject characteristics, and between electrode DLs and speech perception performance were also examined. A significant correlation between age at implantation and electrode DLs for the basal position was found, indicating that subjects implanted at a later age had larger DLs for <b>basal</b> <b>electrodes.</b> No correlations were found for electrode DLs at the apical and mid positions. Also, electrode DLs for the three positions did not correlate with any other subject variables, such as duration of implant use.

The {{study shows}} that there are {{differences}} in the measurement of the action potentials with and without the stylet in the Nucleus Freedom Contour Advance that are higher in the apex than in the base of the cochlea.

40|$|International audienceTwo forward-masking {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} six cochlear implant listeners to test whether asymmetric pulse shapes would improve the place-specificity of stimulation compared to symmetric ones. The maskers were either cathodic-first symmetric biphasic, pseudomonophasic (i. e., with a second anodic phase longer and lower in amplitude than the first phase), or "delayed pseudomonophasic" (identical to pseudomonophasic but with an inter-phase gap) stimuli. In experiment 1, forward-masking patterns for monopolar maskers were obtained by keeping each masker fixed on a middle electrode of the array and measuring the masked thresholds of a monopolar signal presented on several other electrodes. The results were very variable, and no difference between pulse shapes was found. In experiment 2, six maskers were used in a wide bipolar (bipolar+ 9) configuration: the same three pulse shapes as in experiment 1, either cathodic-first relative to the most apical or relative to the most <b>basal</b> <b>electrode</b> of the bipolar channel. The pseudomonophasic masker showed a stronger excitation proximal to the electrode of the bipolar pair for which the short, high-amplitude phase was anodic. However, no difference was obtained with the symmetric and, more surprisingly, with the delayed pseudomonophasic maskers. Implications for cochlear implant design are discussed...|$|E

This behavioral {{study on}} cats has shown stimulus generalization for acoustic to electrical {{stimulation of the}} cochlea at frequencies from 100 to 8, 000 pulse/sec. Response thresholds were determined for electrical stimulation of the apical and basal turns of the cochlea. The results show a linear increase in response threshold with rate of electrical stimulation up to a frequency of 2, 000 pulse/sec. The response threshold was also lower for electrical stimulation of the basal rather than the apical electrode.

The difference limen was also lower for electrical stimulation of the apical rather than the <b>basal</b> <b>electrode.</b> The results of this study show that electrical stimulation of the cochlea may produce pitch sensation for rates of stimulation up to 200 pulse/sec.

40|$|Forward-masked psychophysical spatial tuning curves (fmSTCs) were {{measured}} in 15 cochlear-implant subjects, 10 using monopolar stimulation and 5 using bipolar stimulation.

Average tuning curve slopes and bandwidths did not vary significantly across electrode regions. Spatial tuning curves were symmetrical and similar in width across the three electrode regions. However, several subjects demonstrated large changes in slope and/or bandwidth across the three electrode regions, indicating poorer tuning in localized regions of the array. Cochlear-implant users exhibited bandwidths that were approximately five times wider than normal-hearing acoustic listeners but {{were in the same}} range as acoustic listeners with moderate cochlear hearing loss.

Cochlear implant {{users with}} some residual {{hearing in the}} non-implanted ear compared the pitch sensations produced by acoustic pure tones and pulsatile electric stimuli. Pitch comparisons were obtained for pure tones and electrical stimuli presented at different positions (electrodes) in the scala tympani, keeping the electric pulse rate fixed at 100, 250, or 800 pps. Similarly, pitch comparisons were obtained for electrical stimuli with variable pulse rates presented to two fixed electrode positions (apical and basal) in the cochlea. Both electrode position and pulse rate influenced the perceived pitch of the electrical signal and 'matched' electric and acoustic signals were found {{over a wide range}} of frequencies. There was a large variation between listeners. For some stimuli, listeners had difficulty in deciding whether the acoustic or electric stimulus was higher in pitch. Despite the variability, consistent trends were obtained from the data: higher frequencies tended to be matched by more <b>basal</b> <b>electrodes</b> for all pulse rates. Higher frequencies tended to be matched by higher pulse rates for both electrode positions. The electrode positions that 'matched' pure tones were more basal than predicted from the characteristic frequency coordinates of the basilar membrane in a normal human cochlea.

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{perceived}} pitch and naturalness {{of popular music}} by cochlear implant (CI) users. Methods: Eleven experienced post-lingually deafened adult CI users rated the pitch, naturalness, and clarity of a popular song with 10 frequency allocation settings, including the default. The alternative settings all had logarithmic frequency spacing and frequency shifts of less than one octave compared with the default map. For maps which were perceived as having incorrect pitch, participants adjusted the pitch of the song in real time using a slider, in order to normalize it, {{and the amount of}} adjustment was recorded. Results: The default map was rated as having close to correct pitch. Naturalness rating was negatively correlated with basal shift from a baseline logarithmic map, which was the same as the default map for <b>basal</b> <b>electrodes</b> (R 2 = 0. 77). Ratings of the clarity of the lyrics were adversely affected by basal shift. The majority of participants were able to rate and adjust pitch appropriately. The frequency shift in the map was highly correlated with participants’ adjustments of the pitch slider (R 2 = 0. 94), but the adjustments were less than expected for the majority of participants. Discussion: The pitch ratings for the default allocation suggest that participants have acclimatized to their processors’ frequency allocations. Adjustment of the pitch of the song was possible for the majority and suggested that all but one participant was experiencing frequency compression. Expansion of the frequency allocation might help to alleviate this. Conclusion: Adjustment of the pitch of a popular song could be helpful for tuning CIs. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Current {{cochlear}} implant stimulation strategies are widely {{based on the}} continuous interleaved sampling (CIS) paradigm. With CIS, temporal fine structure is only crudely represented in the stimulation pattern, and pitch is encoded primarily {{in the place of}} stimulation and to a limited extent in the temporal fluctuations of the channel envelopes. However, fine structure information is a crucial ingredient for the perception of music and of tonal languages, as demonstrated in studies with normal hearing subjects. In the fine structure strategy presented, “channel specific sampling sequences” (CSSS) or pulse-packages are applied to the apical electrodes, while the remaining <b>basal</b> <b>electrodes</b> carry CIS-like stimuli. The pulse sequences are triggered by the zero-crossings of the corresponding filter channel outputs and scaled with the channel envelopes. Thus, both fine time structure and envelope information are represented on CSSS channels. The new strategy has been evaluated in two experiments: In a first experiment, pitch discrimination and scaling abilities were compared for the fine structure strategy and CIS in four MED-EL implant recipients. For pure tone stimuli below 300 Hz, pitch discrimination with CIS was limited. Conversely, CSSS seems to add robust temporal cues to pitch at low frequencies, supporting better discrimination. In a second experiment, speech reception measures were taken for MEDEL implant recipients and native speakers of Cantonese Chinese in Hong Kong. Preliminary results from a pilot study showed substantial improvements in the perception of lexical tones with the fine structure strategy over CIS and triggered a more extensive survey.

This version is reproduced {{with the permission of}} the publisher. Electrical stimulation of the residual auditory nerve fibres in a postlingually deaf patient was effected by ten electrodes implanted 1. 5 mm apart in the scala tympani. Biphasic current pulses with each phase fixed at 180 µs were used. Psychophysical results obtained by activating one electrode at a time showed the following characteristics: (a) loudness was found to increase with both current level and repetition rate; (b) pitch increased with repetition rate; (c) pitch and sharpness increased in the apical to basal direction in accordance with the tonotopic organisation of the cochlea; (d) dissimilarity measures obtained by triadic comparisons provided evidence that the sensations produced by repetition rate and electrode position are perceptually separable; (e) for short-duration stimuli the discrimination performance for electrode trajectories was much better than for repetition rate trajectories.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} cochlear implant (CI) users’ ability to perceive pitch cues from time-varying virtual channels (VCs) to identify pitch contours. Seven CI users were tested on apical, medial, and <b>basal</b> <b>electrode</b> pairs with stimulus durations from 100 to 1000 ms. In one stimulus set, 9 pitch contours {{were created by}} steering current between the component electrodes and the VC halfway between the electrodes. Another stimulus set only contained 3 pitch contours (flat, falling, and rising). VC discrimination was also tested on the same electrodes. The total current level of dual-electrode stimuli was linearly interpolated between those of single-electrode stimuli to minimize loudness changes. The results showed that pitch contour identification (PCI) scores were similar across electrode locations, and significantly improved at longer durations. For durations longer than 300 ms, 2 subjects had nearly perfect 9 -contour identification, and 5 subjects perfectly identified the 3 basic contours. Both PCI and VC discrimination varied greatly across subjects. Cumulative d′ values for VC discrimination were significantly correlated with 100 -, 200 -, and 500 -ms PCI scores. These results verify the feasibility of encoding pitch contours using current steering, and suggest that identification of such pitch contours strongly relies on CI users’ sensitivity to VCs...|$|E

Psychophysical {{measurements were}} performed in three hearing-impaired adult subjects implanted with a CI 22 cochlear prosthesis (Cochlear Ltd.) {{fitted with a}} developmental peri-modiolar electrode array. The array was manufactured with a curvature approximating that of the inner wall of the scala tympani but, after straightening and insertion, lay on average about half way between {{the inner and outer}} walls of the scala. All subjects were tested with bipolar stimulation; two were also tested with monopolar, employing the most <b>basal</b> <b>electrode</b> as the return. Maximum comfortable level and threshold reduced with decreasing distance of electrode from the modiolus, whereas dynamic range increased. The linearity of the loudness growth function did not vary significantly with electrode position but the function was more non-linear for lower maximum comfortable levels. Current level discrimination, normalized with respect to dynamic range, improved with decreasing distance of electrode from the modiolus in two subjects. Pitch varied regularly with insertion depth of the stimulated electrode for bipolar stimulation in two subjects and also for monopolar stimulation in one subject. Electrode discrimination was enhanced by closeness to the modiolus. Whereas the forward masking patterns for bipolar stimulation of electrodes close to the modiolus had a sharp double-peaked structure, those for monopolar stimulation were flatter and had a single peak.

40|$|Cochlear implant (CI) users usually exhibit marked across-electrode {{differences}} in detection thresholds with Bfocused ^ modes of stimulation, such as partial-tripolar (pTP) mode. This may reflect differences either in local neural survival {{or in the}} distance of the electrodes from the modiolus. To shed light on these two explanations, we compared stimulus-detection thresholds and gap-detection thresholds (GDTs) at comfortably loud levels for at least four electrodes in each of ten Advanced Bionics CI users, using 1031 -pps pulse trains. The electrodes selected for each user had a wide range of stimulus-detection thresholds in pTP mode. We also measured across-electrode variations in both stimulus-detection and gap-detection tasks in monopolar (MP) mode. Both stimulus-detection and gap-detection thresholds correlated across modes. However, there was no significant correlation between stimulus-detection and gap-detection thresholds in either mode. Hence, gap-detection thresholds likely tap a source of across-electrode variation additional to, or different from, that revealed by stimulus-detection thresholds. Stimulus-detection thresholds were significantly lower for apical than for <b>basal</b> <b>electrodes</b> in both modes; this was only true for gap detection in pTP mode. Finally, although the across-electrode standard deviation in stimulus-detection thresholds was greater in pTP than in MP mode, the reliability of these differences—assessed by dividing the across-electrode standard deviation by the stan-dard deviation across adaptive runs for each electrode—was similar for the two modes; this metric was also similar across modes for gap detection. Hence across-electrode differences can be revealed using clinically available MP stimula-tion, with a reliability comparable to that observed with focused stimulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{depth of}} {{electrode}} insertion of a {{multichannel cochlear implant}} has been suggested as a clinical variable that may correlate with word recognition using the implant. The current study evaluates this relationship using the human temporal bone collection at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. Twenty-seven temporal bones of subjects with cochlear implants were studied. Temporal bones were removed at autopsy, fixed and prepared for histological study by standard techniques. Specimens were then serially sectioned, and reconstructed by two-dimensional methods. Three measures of length were made from each subject's reconstruction: (1) depth of insertion (DI) of the cochlear implant electrode array, from the round window to the array's apical tip; (2) inserted length (IL) from the cochleostomy to the apical tip of the array, and (3) cochlear duct length (CDL) from the round window to the helicotrema. The active electrode length (AEL) {{was defined as the}} distance between the most apical and most <b>basal</b> <b>electrodes</b> of the array. Stepwise regression was used to identify whether subsets of six metrics associated with insertion depth (DI, DI/AEL, DI/CDL, IL, IL/AEL and IL/CDL), duration of deafness, sound-processing strategy, potential for central impairment and age at implantation accounted for significant across-subject variance in the last recorded NU- 6 word score measured during each subject's life. Age at implantation and potential for central impairment account for significant percentages of the across-subject variance in NU- 6 word scores for the 27 subjects studied. None of the insertion metrics accounted for significant performance variance, even when the variance associated with the other variables was controlled. These results, together with those of previous studies, are consistent with a relatively weak association between electrode insertion depth and speech reception...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that a main {{limitation}} of the cochlear implant is the spread of current induced by each electrode, which activates an inappropriately large range of sensory neurons. To reduce this spread, an alternative stimulation mode, the all-polar mode, was tested with five participants. It was designed to activate all the electrodes simultaneously with appropriate current levels and polarities to recruit narrower regions of auditory nerves at specific intracochlear electrode positions (denoted all-polar electrodes). In this study, the all-polar mode was compared with the current commercial stimulation mode: the monopolar mode. The participants were asked to judge the sound dissimilarity between pairs of two-electrode pulse-train stimuli that differed in the electrode positions and were presented in either monopolar or all-polar mode with pulses on the two electrodes presented either sequentially or simultaneously. The dissimilarity ratings were analyzed using a multidimensional scaling technique and three-dimensional stimulus perceptual spaces were produced. For all the conditions (mode and simultaneity), the first perceptual dimension was highly correlated with the position of the most apical activated electrode of the electrical stimulation and the second dimension with the position of the most <b>basal</b> <b>electrode.</b> In both sequential and simultaneous conditions, the monopolar and all-polar stimuli were significantly separated by a third dimension, which may indicate that all-polar stimuli have a perceptual quality that differs from monopolar stimuli.

Phoneme and word score averages for the 1 - and 2 -year follow-up were calculated for 41 prelingually deaf and 162 postlingually deaf patients. Analyses to reveal correlations between these performance outcomes and 6 position-related variables (angle of most <b>basal</b> <b>electrode</b> contact, surgical insertion angle, surgical insertion, wrapping factor, angular insertion depth, linear insertion depth) were executed.

40|$|The overall {{complication}} rate of cochlear implant surgery {{is low and}} so-called electrode failures (electrode migration, misplacement, etc.,) account for {{only a minority of}} all complications. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the prevalence of electrode migration as the cause for increased impedance values and non-auditory stimulation in the basal channels. Within the scope of a quality control process, the cochlear implant database of the Kuopio University Hospital (Finland) was reviewed. Patients with gradual elevation of impedance values and/or non-auditory stimulation of the <b>basal</b> <b>electrode</b> channels were re-examined and cone-beam computed tomography was administered. There were 162 cochlear implant recipients and 201 implanted devices registered in the database. A total of 18 patients (18 devices) were identified having significantly increased impedance values or non-auditory stimulation of the basal electrodes. Cone-beam computed tomography revealed extra-cochlear electrodes in 12 of these patients due to the migration of the electrode array. All extruded electrodes were lateral wall electrodes, i. e., straight electrode arrays (Cochlear CI 422 and Med-El devices). The most common feature of electrode migration was the gradual increase of the impedance values in the basal electrodes, even though telemetry could also be unsuspicious.

40|$|A {{review of}} {{geophysical}} applications to investigation and monitoring of landfills identified that the geoelectrical methods, such as ERT, SP and EM, are ideally suited because much {{information can be}} inferred from the electrical characteristics of landfill waste. The review identified scope for further development due to constraints of geophysical surveying along the ground surface. In particular, the ERT method suffers a loss of data accuracy and resolution with increasing depth of investigation. These constraints have provided the main focus for interest during this research project. A field test site was examined on a reconnaissance basis using a multi- method geophysical approach to obtain the best possible sub-surface characterisation and interpretation {{in the absence of}} intrusive calibration data. On the basis of results obtained a model was produced showing combined geoelectrical response, which may be used to plan further detailed investigations including conventional intrusive site examination. It is further demonstrated that the effectiveness of ERT in a landfill setting lies with the arrangement of measurement electrodes and application of specialised electrode address configurations. In an active landfill setting, <b>basal</b> <b>electrodes</b> installed within the cell drainage medium prior to waste emplacement were used in conjunction with ground surface electrodes and the address configuration applied across the array pair. Delineation of basal leachate accumulation and differentiation from perched tables within the waste profile was possible. In a closed landfill setting, where restorative capping and leachate extraction was scheduled, a system for ERT monitoring was established by installing vertical electrode arrays during routine drilling and emplacement of gas wells. In this setting, baseline sub surface geoelectrical characteristics were identified against which the effects of landfill capping and leachate extraction were assessed through variance in model resistivities and percentage resistivity change. This research has provided recommendations for geophysical monitoring best practice, which may help site stakeholders to achieve a more effective management of leachate control systems, to assess the effectiveness of restorative strategies, and to demonstrate legislative compliance with a greater degree of certainty.

Objective: The aims of this study were to determine whether electrode discrimination by early-deafened subjects using the Cochlear Limited prosthesis varied at different locations on the electrode array, was influenced by the effects of auditory deprivation and experience with electric stimulation, and was related to speech perception. Design: Difference limens for electrode discrimination were measured in 16 early-deafened subjects at three positions on the array: electrodes 18 (apical), 14 (mid), and 8 (<b>basal).</b> <b>Electrodes</b> were stimulated using random variations in current level to minimize the influence of loudness cues. Assessed were correlations between the difference limens, subject variables related to auditory deprivation (age at onset of deafness, duration of deafness, and age at implantation) and auditory experience (duration of implant use and the total time period of auditory experience), and speech perception scores from two closed-set and two open-set tests. Results: The average difference limens across the three positions were less than two electrodes for 75 %, of subjects, with average limens between 2 and 6. 5 electrodes for the remaining 25 % of subjects. Significant differences across the three positions were found for 69 % of subjects. The average limens and those at the basal position positively correlated with variables related to auditory deprivation, with larger limens for subjects implanted at a later age and with a longer duration of deafness. The average limens and those at the apical position negatively correlated with closed-set speech perception scores, with lower scores for subjects with larger limens, but not with open-set scores. Speech scores also negatively correlated with variables related to auditory deprivation. Conclusions: These findings showed that early-deafened subjects were generally successful in electrode discrimination although performance varied across the array for over half the subjects. Discrimination performance was influenced by the effects of auditory deprivation, and both electrode discrimination and variables related to auditory deprivation influenced closed-set speech perception.

For the Advanced Bionics and MedEl users the pulses were triphasic {{and consisted of}} a 32 -μs central phase flanked by two 32 -μs phases of opposite polarity and half the amplitude. The central phase was either anodic (TP-A) or cathodic (TP-C). For the Cochlear Corp. users, pulses consisted of two 32 -μs phases of the same polarity separated by an 8 -μs gap, flanked by two 32 -μs phases of the opposite polarity, each of which was separated from the central portion by a 58 -μs gap. The central portion of these quadraphasic pulses was either anodic (QP-A) or cathodic (QP-C), and all phases had the same amplitude.

This polarity effect was similar across all electrode locations studied, including the most apical electrode of the MedEl device which stimulates the very apex of the cochlea.

Our study included 40 congenitally deaf children with CI, which were divided into two groups according to their age at operation: mean age of the group 1 was 2. 3 years and group 2 11. 3 years. Before the operation children were involved in rehabilitation by verbotonal method. The goal was to determine whether the duration of deafness prior to surgery influenced postoperative NRT and behavioral measurements. Analysed parameters were measured on the apical, middle and <b>basal</b> <b>electrode</b> two years after the surgery and compared retrospectively with the values measured immediately after surgery. Results were analyzed statistically in order to determine the differences between groups, among the groups (variability within the cochlea) and over time within each group. The hypothesis was that the indicators of preservation of spiral ganglion neurons in all parts of the cochlea are better in children operated at the optimal age. Overall results did not clearly and consistently confirmed hypothesis, but indicated possible distinctions in perceptual abilities that are relevant to programming cochlear implants and the ability to use electrical stimulation, which are associated with age at surgery and preoperative rehabilitation. In addition, the values of NRT, in particular when analyzed together with the values from the maps, help gaining insight into the state of hearing in each particular CI user...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} investigated the effects of asymmetric current waveforms on the perception of place and temporal pitch cues. The asymmetric waveforms were trains of pseudomonophasic (PS) pulses consisting of a short, high-amplitude phase followed by a longer (and lower amplitude) opposite-polarity phase. When such pulses were presented in a narrow bipolar (“BP+ 1 ”) mode and with the first phase anodic relative to the most apical electrode (so-called PSA pulses), pitch was lower than when the first phase was anodic re the more <b>basal</b> <b>electrode.</b> For a pulse rate of 12 pulses per second (pps), pitch was also lower than with standard symmetric biphasic pulses in either monopolar or bipolar mode. This suggests that PSA pulses can extend the range of place-pitch percepts available to cochlear implant listeners by focusing the spread of excitation in a more apical region than common stimulation techniques. Temporal pitch was studied by requiring subjects to pitch-rank single-channel pulse trains with rates ranging from 105 to 1, 156  pps; this task was repeated at several intra-cochlear stimulation sites and using both symmetric and pseudomonophasic pulses. For PSA pulses presented to apical electrodes, the upper limit of temporal pitch {{was significantly higher than}} that for all the other conditions, averaging 713  pps. Measures of discriminability obtained using the method of constant stimuli indicated that this pitch percept was probably weak. However, a multidimensional scaling study showed that the percept associated with a rate change, even at high rates, was orthogonal to that of a place change and therefore reflected a genuine change in the temporal pattern of neural activity...|$|E
40|$|Commercially {{available}} cochlear implants (CIs) {{stimulate the}} auditory nerve (AN) using symmetric biphasic current (BP) pulses. However, recent data {{have shown that}} the use of asymmetric pulse shapes could be beneficial in terms of reducing power consumption, increasing dynamic range and limiting channel interactions. In these charge-balanced stimuli, the effectiveness of one phase (one polarity) is reduced by making it longer and lower in amplitude than the other. For the design of novel CI speech processing strategies using asymmetric pulses, it is particularly relevant to know which of the two polarities (negative/cathodic or positive/anodic) is most effective. Animal research and theoretical modeling suggest that the cathodic phase is the most “effective” one in terms of producing most of the excitation in the auditory nerve. However, recent behavioral (psychophysical) and electro-physiological data obtained from CI users in our lab suggest that the anodic phase is more effective than the cathodic one (Macherey et al., 2008). The present study tested the generality of the finding that the anodic phase is most effective to different sites along the cochlea. Polarity effects were examined by means of the Electrically Evoked Compound Action Potential (ECAP) obtained by using the masker-probe paradigm, in which a large ECAP is obtained only when both the masker and the probe produce a large neural response. Monopolar stimulation was applied to the apical, middle and <b>basal</b> <b>electrodes</b> of the Advanced Bionics device. The results of all experiments were similar for all electrodes. Experiment 1 used a standard biphasic cathodic- 1 st masker and showed that the ECAP latency was shorter for anodic- 1 st than for cathodic- 1 st probe, respectively, on all electrodes. Experiment 2 used anodic and cathodic maskers with standard biphasic probes. ECAP responses were only obtained when the masker was anodic. Experiment 3 used a standard biphasic cathodic- 1 st masker and showed that latency was shorter for the anodic- 1 st than for cathodic- 1 st probe and it increased when the phase duration of the probe was increased. Experiment 4 used a masker and probe with the same polarity and showed that ECAP responses were only obtained only when the masker and the probe were anodic. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the Differential-Rate Sound Processing (DRSP) strategy for speech perception by users of the Nucleus cochlear implant. The DRSP strategy uses both low and high rates of stimulation – applying a low rate of stimulation to apical, lower-frequency electrodes and a high rate of stimulation to <b>basal,</b> higher-frequency <b>electrodes.</b> Ten patients implanted with the Nucleus CI- 24 M cochlear implant were evaluated with three speech processing strategies: 250 pulses per second (pps) over all electrodes, 1500 pps over all electrodes, and DRSP with 250 pps on electrodes up to 2400 Hz and 1500 pps for the remaining electrodes. There was no difference found between strategies across research subjects for consonant, vowel, CVC words and sentences-in-noise tests. However, there were significant individual subject differences confirming that there is still a case for considering low-rate stimulation when Mapping patients. The DRSP strategy demonstrated a compromise between the fixed low-rate and high-rate strategies that can perform equal to or better than either of these strategies for most subjects. 1...|$|R
40|$|Objective/Hypothesis: It is {{reasonable}} to suppose that the pattern of sensorineural damage {{along the length of}} the cochlea depends on the etiology of a hearing loss (HL).

40|$|Objective: As {{the need}} for {{objective}} measures with cochlear implant users increases, {{it is critical to}} understand how electrical potentials behave when stimulus parameters are systematically varied. The {{purpose of this study was}} to record and evaluate the effects of implanted electrode site and stimulus current level on latency, amplitude, and threshold measures of electrically evoked auditory potentials, representing brainstem and cortical levels of the auditory system. Design: The electrical auditory brainstem response (EABR), electrical auditory middle latency re-sponse (EAMLR), and the electrical late auditory response (ELAR) were recorded from the same ex-perimental subjects, 11 adult Clarion cochlear im-plant users. The Waves II, III, and V of the EABR, the Na-Pa complex of the EAMLR and the N 1 -P 2 complex of the ELAR were investigated relative to electrode site (along the intra-cochlear electrode array) and stimulus current level. Evoked potential measures were examined for statistical significance using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Results: For the EABR, Wave V latency was signifi-cantly longer for the <b>basal</b> <b>electrode</b> (7) compared with the mid (4) and apical (1) electrodes. For the EAMLR and ELAR, there were no significant differ-ences in latency by electrode site. For all subjects and each of the evoked potentials, the apical elec-trodes tended to have the largest amplitude and the basal electrodes the smallest amplitude, although amplitude differences did not reach statistical sig-nificance. In general, decreases in stimulus current level resulted in statistically significant decreases in the amplitude of Wave V, Na-Pa and N 1 -P 2. The evoked potential thresholds for Wave V, Na-Pa, and N 1 -P 2 were significantly higher for the basal Elec...|$|E

This version is reproduced with permission from Annals Publishing Company. [URL] the electric coding of speech for multiple-electrode cochlear implants, acoustic frequency ranges are mapped onto electrodes. The question arises as to whether the pitches of the electrically evoked hearing sensations are similar to those evoked by the corresponding acoustic stimuli in normal-hearing listeners. Obviously, the sensations are similar enough for many postlingually deaf implant users to understand speech with a minimum of retraining, but {{it is unlikely that the}} electric signals sound identical to the acoustic ones. There will also be differences between implant users arising from the variable insertion depth of the electrode array, the number of electrodes in use, and the frequency-to-electrode mapping. The most direct method of determining pitch is to ask implant users to compare electric and acoustic stimuli, but studies of this sort have been hampered by the fact that very few implant users have usable hearing for acoustic signals. In 1978, Eddington et al 1 reported pitch-matching results for one unilaterally deaf volunteer. They concluded that pitch matching was "roughly consistent with electrode position and tonotopic maps of the cochlea derived from basilar membrane motion and hearing loss measurements. " Several other studies 2 - 6 have investigated the relative pitch of electric signals using identification, scaling, and discrimination paradigms. These studies have established that electrode placement, electrode configuration, and rate of stimulation all affect the perceived pitch, and that the pitch increases tonotopically from apical to <b>basal</b> <b>electrode</b> positions. They have not determined the pitch of electric stimuli in an absolute fashion that can be compared with acoustic stimuli, however. A knowledge of the absolute pitch of electric stimuli for individuals, or as a function of position in the cochlea, would be very useful in optimizing the frequency mapping for cochlear implants. The present study directly compared the pitch of acoustic pure tones in one ear with electric signals in the other ear of implant users with some residual hearing in the nonimplanted ear. The main questions addressed were whether the pulse rate of a matched electric stimulus would be equal to the frequency of the acoustic tone, and whether the electrode used in the matched stimulus would correspond in position to the place of maximum basilar membrane motion produced by the acoustic tone in a normal cochlea.

40|$|The {{influence}} of neonatal deafness on cochlear electrically evoked Fos {{expression in the}} auditory brainstem was examined. Newborn rats were deafened by systemic injection of kanamycin, 1 mg/g daily for 12 days. At 4, 5, 6 or 8 weeks of age, these animals received cochlear electrical stimulation with a <b>basal</b> monopolar <b>electrode</b> for 90 minutes. Age-matched untreated control animals received similar stimulation. Experimental and control animals were assessed for spiral ganglion cell densities and Fos immunoreactive staining in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus. Spiral ganglion cell assessments showed significant decreases in spiral ganglion cell densities in deafened rats compared to age-matched controls, at 5 weeks of age in lower turns and 6 and 8 weeks in all turns. Cochlear electrical stimulation induced Fos immunoreactive staining in the nucleus of auditory brain stem neurons in treatment and control groups. A significantly greater number of Fos immunoreactive neurons {{was found in the}} contralateral central nucleus of inferior colliculus in 5, 6 and 8 week old deafened animals compared to age-matched controls.
