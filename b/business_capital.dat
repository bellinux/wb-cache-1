25|$|Most jurisdictions {{imposing}} {{an income}} tax treat capital gains as part of income subject to tax. Capital gain is generally a gain on sale of capital assets—that is, those assets not held {{for sale in the}} ordinary course of <b>business.</b> <b>Capital</b> assets include personal assets in many jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions provide preferential rates of tax or only partial taxation for capital gains. Some jurisdictions impose different rates or levels of capital gains taxation based on the length of time the asset was held. Because tax rates are often much lower for capital gains than for ordinary income, there is widespread controversy and dispute about the proper definition of capital. Some tax scholars have argued that differences in the ways different kinds of capital and investment are taxed contribute to economic distortions.|$|E
25|$|Taxable income {{includes}} capital gains. However, {{individuals are}} taxed {{at a lower}} rate on long term capital gains and qualifying dividends (see below). A capital gain is the excess of the sales price over the tax basis (usually, the cost) of capital assets, generally those assets not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of <b>business.</b> <b>Capital</b> losses (where basis is more than sales price) are deductible, but deduction for long term capital losses {{is limited to the}} total capital gains for the year, plus for individuals up to $3,000 of ordinary income ($1,500 if married filing separately). An individual may exclude $250,000 ($500,000 for a married couple filing jointly) of capital gains on the sale of the individual's primary residence, subject to certain conditions and limitations. Gains on depreciable property used in a business are treated as ordinary income to the extent of depreciation previously claimed.|$|E

2500|$|Who {{were these}} people in terms of class or profession? [...] In the Canon, most of them evidently own land, but they usually have labourers to do the {{physical}} work. [...] Sometimes they are also in business. [...] In fact, they illustrate how {{it is in the}} first instance wealth derived from agriculture which provides <b>business</b> <b>capital.</b> [...] The average gahapati who gave material support to the Buddha and his Sangha thus seems to have been something like a gentleman farmer, perhaps with a town house. [...] On the other hand, inscriptions in the western Deccan, where Buddhism flourished in the early centuries CE, use the term gahapati to refer to urban merchants. [...] We must distinguish between reference and meaning: the meaning of gahapati is simple and unvarying, but the reference shifts with the social context.|$|E
2500|$|On July 30, 1937, Tientsin {{fell to the}} Empire of Japan {{as part of a}} {{military}} operation in the Second Sino-Japanese War but was not entirely occupied, as the Japanese mostly continued to respect the integrity and extraterritoriality of foreign concessions in Tientsin until 1941. In December 1937, Japanese took Shanghai, China's <b>business</b> <b>capital.</b> It was a major blow to the government of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, as 85% of all Chinese government revenue came from Shanghai. After the loss of Shanghai, the economic ability of China to continue to resist Japan was very much in doubt. Flush with a series of Japanese victories in China, in early January 1938, the Japanese Prime Minister Prince Fumimaro Konoe announced a set of sweeping [...] "non-negotiable" [...] war aims that would have transformed China into a virtual protectorate of Japan's if implemented.

Hurt’s position on Government regulation is clear in his statement that “By reducing the unnecessary government regulations that hinder small businesses, keeping taxes low and allowing people to keep more of what they make, and cutting spending to get our fiscal house in order, the private sector will gain the confidence necessary to expand and create the jobs that the people of the 5th District need and deserve.” ...|$|E

6000|$|If {{one dollar}} covers {{the expense of}} making one spade, then when a [...] spade, by virtue of a sudden demand, rises in value to one dollar [...] and ten cents, the {{manufacturers}} get an extra profit of ten cents. [...] This could not long remain so, because other capital would enter [...] this industry, and so increase the supply that one spade would [...] sell for only one dollar; then all would receive the average [...] profit. If, owing to a cessation of demand for spades, the price [...] fell to ninety cents, then the manufacturers would lose ten cents [...] on each one made and sold. Thereupon they would cease to do a [...] losing <b>business,</b> <b>capital</b> would be withdrawn, and spades would not [...] be made until the supply was suited to the necessary expense of [...] making them (one dollar). In this way, whenever there is a [...] departure of the value from the normal cost, there is set in [...] motion ipso facto a series of forces which automatically [...] restores the value to that cost. So here again we see the nature [...] of an economic law: the value may not often correspond exactly [...] with cost of production, {{but there is a}} tendency in all values [...] to conform to that cost, and this tendency they irresistibly obey.
