40|$|Beef {{producers}} need cows to <b>become</b> <b>pregnant,</b> deliver healthy calves, and wean productive calves {{in order}} to make their operations economically viable. The failure of breeding females to <b>become</b> <b>pregnant</b> directly impacts the economic viability of every beef operation, yet few producers realize how infertility impacts their individual operations. Infertile beef cows and heifers can fall into three primary groups: 1) cows that fail to <b>become</b> <b>pregnant</b> dur-ing the breeding season (usually 60 – 120 days); 2) cows that <b>become</b> <b>pregnant</b> but fail to calve; and 3) cows that <b>become</b> <b>pregnant</b> late in the breeding season. Infertility that leads to the failure of a cow or heifer to calve during the subsequent calving season results in the single largest economic loss to beef producers; this is because no economic return wil...|$|R

5|$|The Simpsons uses a {{floating}} timeline {{in which the}} characters do not physically age, and as such the show {{is assumed to be}} set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Maggie is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and sister to Bart and Lisa. When Marge <b>became</b> <b>pregnant</b> with Bart, she and Homer got married at a chapel in Las Vegas. To support his impending family, Homer all but demanded a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, impressing its owner, Mr. Burns, with his aggressive submissiveness. When Marge <b>became</b> <b>pregnant</b> with Lisa, two years later, she and Homer bought their first house. Another six years later, Homer felt financially secure enough to finally quit his job at the Power Plant and take his dream job at Barney's Bowlarama. However, Marge <b>became</b> <b>pregnant</b> with Maggie, so Homer, once again unable to support his family, was forced to reapply for his old job. By the time Maggie was born, Homer had shown great signs of distress, but he managed to find motivation in the form of his newborn baby girl.|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} has demonstrated that there are numerous medical and psychological consequences when a woman with an eating disorder <b>becomes</b> <b>pregnant.</b> There has been a paucity of research, however, examining the attitudes towards pregnancy of women with body image issues/eating disorders and how these attitudes subsequently affect intentions to <b>become</b> <b>pregnant.</b> The present study examines intentions to <b>become</b> <b>pregnant</b> among a sample of women ranging in level of body image concerns using the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) as a framework (Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980). Two hundred and forty-two females from an introductory psychology class completed a questionnaire, including the Eating Disorder Inventory (Garner, 1991) and specific scales targeting the components of the TRA developed for the present study. As expected, all TRA precursors to intentions were positively correlated with intentions to <b>become</b> <b>pregnant,</b> while contrary to predictions, body image was not correlated with intentions. In partial support of the TRA, a multiple regression analysis revealed that, for all participants, the subjective norm of pregnancy and perceived benefits of pregnancy were predictive of intentions to <b>become</b> <b>pregnant.</b> Perceived costs of pregnancy, however, evidenced no ability to predict intentions to <b>become</b> <b>pregnant.</b> Although results failed to support the prediction that those with high body image concerns would indicate a lower intention to <b>become</b> <b>pregnant,</b> significant differences among those with high versus low body image concerns did emerge. Specifically, participants with high body image concerns reported greater perceived costs of pregnancy as well as a greater likelihood of engaging in weight control behaviours during pregnancy. Implications, as well as practical applications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

To Lindenberg's great distress, Sharaf writes, Reich insisted on an abortion, at that time illegal. They went to Berlin, where the psychoanalyst Edith Jacobson helped to arrange it.|$|E
