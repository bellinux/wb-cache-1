50|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known species is <b>Bryobia</b> praetiosa, the clover mite or brown clover mite, an {{economically}} important pest of over 250 species of plants. It occurs nearly worldwide. Like other <b>bryobia</b> mites, this species is herbivorous, {{but there have been}} occasional reports of it occurring as an ectoparasite on humans, particularly children. It causes an itchy skin irritation. There has also been an isolated case report of an infestation in a domestic cat.|$|E
50|$|The great {{majority}} of <b>Bryobia</b> mites are asexual (although certain species do reproduce sexually). Their populations are all female, and individuals reproduce by thelytoky, a form of parthenogenesis. They emerge from unfertilized eggs. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the asexual species in the genus are not a monophyletic group; indicating that asexual reproduction evolved several times or that sexuality re-evolved. The asexual species have {{a high level of}} genetic diversity considering that they are clones; this may have arisen through hybridization and mutation. In at least two species, namely <b>Bryobia</b> kissophila and B. praetiosa, asexuality is caused by the parasitic bacterium Wolbachia. This bacterium causes functional apomixis in the mites, so that a female produces only offspring that are identical to her. It is possible that Wolbachia could influence the reproductive processes of most <b>bryobia</b> mite species.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bryobia</b> mites {{are among}} the largest spider mites. The adult is {{visible to the naked}} eye. Mites of this genus are mainly {{distinguished}} by the arrangement of the setae on their bodies. In general, these mites are red in color with whitish setae and long legs with hooked claws.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bryobia</b> is a genus of mites in {{the spider}} mite family, Tetranychidae. The {{taxonomy}} {{of the genus}} is difficult. The genus has been revised several times. It is difficult to distinguish these tiny species from {{each other on the}} basis of morphological characters, and there is little agreement on which characteristics are of importance. Also, species can be variable in morphology. Over 130 species have been described, but many of the names are likely synonyms.|$|E
50|$|The {{life history}} is {{variable}} across species. Typically, {{it takes about}} {{a month for a}} mite to develop from egg and larva to adult.This depends on environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. Some species overwinter in the egg stage. Some species have a single generation per year, while others have several. The eggs are laid singly or in clutches, and some mites may cover the eggs with dust or other matter. Unlike some other spider mites, <b>bryobia</b> mites do not spin webs.|$|E
40|$|Balaustium medicagoense Meyer & Ryke (Acari: Erythraeidae) and <b>Bryobia</b> spp. Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) are {{significant}} emerging pests in Australian grains and pastures. Despite this, {{there is limited}} information known on their basic biology, such as species status and reproductive modes, {{making it difficult to}} develop effective and sustainable control strategies. The species/strain status of Balaustium and <b>Bryobia</b> mites from southern Australia was examined using a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data. In addition, the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method was used to examine the reproductive mode and genetic diversity of Ba. medicagoense from 16 populations within southern Australia. Results indicate {{that there is only one}} species of Balaustium (Ba. medicagoense) and as many as seven species of <b>Bryobia</b> mites currently present in grain crops, pastures and roadsides within southern Australia. The <b>Bryobia</b> species complex consists of four recently described lineages (<b>Bryobia</b> sp. I, <b>Bryobia</b> sp. IV, <b>Bryobia</b> sp. VII, and <b>Bryobia</b> praetiosa Koch) and three additional genetic lineages (<b>Bryobia</b> sp. VIII, <b>Bryobia</b> sp. IX, and <b>Bryobia</b> sp. X) that have not been described previously. <b>Bryobia</b> sp. VIII, B. sp. IX, and B. sp. I seem to be the most abundant species present in Australian broadacre agriculture (i. e., land suitable for farms practicing large-scale crop [agriculture] operations). The AFLP data revealed that Ba. medicagoense reproduces asexually and that genetic diversity was low with only 10 genotypes found. These findings indicate a new complex of pest mites are present within Australian grain crops and pastures and this has implications for their control...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Obligate asexual {{reproduction}} {{is rare in}} the animal kingdom. Generally, asexuals are considered evolutionary dead ends that are unable to radiate. The phytophagous mite genus <b>Bryobia</b> contains {{a large number of}} asexual species. In this study, we investigate the origin and evolution of asexuality using samples from 111 populations in Europe, South Africa and the United States, belonging to eleven <b>Bryobia</b> species. We also examine intraspecific clonal diversity for one species, B. kissophila, by genotyping individuals from 61 different populations. Knowledge on the origin of asexuality and on clonal diversity can contribute {{to our understanding of the}} paradox of sex. Results The majority (94 %) of 111 sampled populations reproduces asexually. Analysis of part of nuclear 28 S rDNA shows that these asexuals do not form a monophyletic clade. Analysis of the mitochondrial COI region shows that intraspecific variation is extensive (up to 8. 8 %). Within B. kissophila, distinct clades are found, which are absent at the nuclear 28 S rDNA level. Moreover, paraphyletic patterns are found at the mitochondrial DNA. Conclusion Asexuality is widespread in the genus <b>Bryobia,</b> signifying that some animal taxa do contain a high number of asexuals. We argue that asexuality originated multiple times within <b>Bryobia.</b> Wolbachia bacteria cause asexuality in at least two <b>Bryobia</b> species and may have infected different species independently. The high intraspecific clonal diversity and the patterns of paraphyly at the mitochondrial DNA in B. kissophila might be explained by a high mutation fixation rate and past hybridization events. Reproductive parasites like Wolbachia and Cardinium might influence these processes. We discuss the role these bacteria could play in the evolutionary success of asexual species. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{vertically}} transmitted endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia modifies host reproduction {{in several}} ways {{in order to enhance}} its own spread. One such modification results in the induction of parthenogenesis, where males, which are unable to transmit Wolbachia, are not produced. Interestingly, parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia have only been found within haplodiploid insects and it is not known whether this exclusivity is the result of functional constraints of Wolbachia. Here we find a unique pattern of Wolbachia infection that is associated with parthenogenesis in six species within the phytophagous mite genus <b>Bryobia.</b> Through antibiotic treatment we show that, in two species, <b>Bryobia</b> praetiosa and an unidentified species, the Wolbachia infection is strictly associated with parthenogenesis. Microsatellite loci show the mechanism of parthenogenesis to be functionally apomictic and not gamete duplication, with progeny identical to their infected mother. Crossing experiments within B. praetiosa showed no evidence of sexual reproduction. These results are discussed with reference to the distribution of parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia and the diversification of the <b>Bryobia</b> genus...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{ecological}} interrelationships of mites {{occurring in}} {{and near the}} Hood River Valley, Oregon, pome fruit orchards were investigated to determine {{the possibility of an}} integrated control program using the species already present. Survey sampling methods were used to study mites on wild hosts (Crataegus douglasii Lindl., Crataegus columbiana Howell, and Amelanchier florida Lindl.) related to pome fruits, abandoned and commercial apple and pear orchards, and soil with its cover in abandoned apple and pear orchards. Distribution of mites among the orchards, within the trees, upon the leaves, and among certain varieties was also investigated. Mites were collected from leaves, spurs and stems, bark, and soil and cover in the orchards; and from leaves, and spurs and stems of the wild hosts. Mites frequently collected from the wild hosts were <b>Bryobia</b> arborea Morgan and Anderson, Panonychus ulmi (Koch), Tydeus californicus (Banks), Tydeus zempoalensis Baker, Typhlodromus rhenanus (Oudms.), and Typhlodromus mcgregori Chant. Eotetranychus carpini (Ewing), Eotetranychus willamettei McG., Balaustium sp., Typhlodromus anachialus (Kennett), Typhlodromus arboreus (Chant), and Typhlodromus crataegi Jorgensen and Chant were collected less frequently. Crataegus columbiana was the preferred habitat for Tydeus californicus, whereas Tydeus zempoalensis preferred Crataegus douglasii. The nature of these preferences is unknown, since both species were apparently non-phytophagous. Pest species (Panonychus ulmi and <b>Bryobia</b> arborea) were abundant on wild host plots only when these were near orchards infested with the same pests. Wild hosts are not considered important sources of pests or predacious species far adjacent orchards at the present time. Forty-seven species of mites were collected from the soil and cover, of which only three (Tetranychus telarius (L), Balaustium sp., Typhlodromus rhenanus) were also abundant on the trees. Since the populations on the trees are apparently isolated from those on the soil and cover, it was concluded that the two populations are independent of each other. Only if pests, such as Tetranychus telarius and predators such as Balaustium sp., which migrate to and from the trees, become numerous in the orchards will the populations on the soil and cover interact directly with populations on the trees. Species which were associated with abandoned and semi-commercial orchards were <b>Bryobia</b> arborea, Panonychus ulmi, Eotetranychus carpini, Tetranychus telarius, Tydeus californicus, Tydeus zempoalensis, Balaustium sp., Mediolata mall, Typhlodromus mcgregori, Typhlodromus rhenanus, and several less abundant species. Mite complexes among the orchards varied markedly, resulting in rather diverse species associations in different orchards. This was particularly true with respect to the predators. Some predators (Typhlodromus rhenanus and Typhlodromus mcgregori) that were abundant in one orchard were virtually absent from others. Also, Tydeus californicus preferred abandoned pear orchards to apple, whereas Tydeus zempoalensis preferred apple. Distributions of predators were never well syncronized with those of the pests, especially Panonychus ulmi. This was true, regardless of what distribution was considered; seasonal, among the orchards, within the trees, upon the leaves, or between mature and immature leaves. As a result of these discrepancies, it was concluded that predation by Typhlodromus rhenanus, Typhlodromus mcgregori, Mediolata mali (Ewing), and Balaustium sp. was not efficient on Panonychus ulmi and <b>Bryobia</b> arborea; but, efficiency was probably higher on Eotetranychus carpini, Eotetranychus willamettei, and Tetranychus telarius. These same discrepancies probably resulted in the lack of interactions between predators and prey that could be identified as causative action {{on the part of the}} predators. Interactions between predators and prey were not sufficient to be interpreted as being caused by predation. The data obtained during this study led to the conclusion that the acarine predators now present would not be particularly beneficial in an integrated control program...|$|E

40|$|At least 20 % of all {{arthropods}} {{and some}} nematode species {{are infected with}} intracellular bacteria of the genus Wolbachia. This highly diverse genus has been subdivided into eight "supergroups" (A to H) {{on the basis of}} nucleotide sequence data. Here, we report the discovery of a new Wolbachia supergroup recovered from the spider mite species <b>Bryobia</b> species V (Acari: Tetranychidae), based on the sequences of three protein-coding genes (ftsZ, gltA, and groEL) and the 16 S rRNA gene. Other tetranychid mites possess supergroup B Wolbachia strains. The discovery of another Wolbachia supergroup expands the known diversity of Wolbachia and emphasizes the high variability of the genus. Our data also clarify the existing supergroup structure and highlight the use of multiple gene sequences for robust phylogenetic analysis. In addition to previous reports of recombination between the arthropod-infecting supergroups A and B, we provide evidence for recombination between the nematode-infecting supergroups C and D. Robust delineation of supergroups is essential for understanding the origin and spread of this common reproductive parasite and for unraveling mechanisms of host adaptation and manipulation across a wide range of hosts...|$|E
40|$|Evaluating the {{economic}} impact of an introduced pest is most useful if it can be carried out before the pest arrives, so that contingency plans for eradicating it can be developed. This has been done by MAFQual (the quality control section of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries) for critical quarantine pests such as Tephritidae (fruit flies). Critical quarantine pests are defined as those which would cause immediate loss of valuable export market access. For quarantine pests (i. e., those serious plant pests which do not occur in New Zealand, but which would not necessarily cause loss of export market access) it is difficult to develop contingency plans in advance. For a quarantine pest, therefore, the decision on whether to attempt to eradicate, contain, or accept the pest must be made after establishment. A cost-benefit analysis must be undertaken comparing all of the costs of an eradication with the benefits of avoiding the damages caused by the introduced pest. Provided the benefits outweigh the costs, eradication can be accepted as a viable option. These procedures were followed before removal of the mite <b>Bryobia</b> lagodechiana Reck from a rose garden in Auckland...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of phytoseiid populations was made of two well- cultivated and regularly sprayed apple orchards with two unsprayed orchards in Cache Valley, northern Utah. Two phytoseiid species, Typhlodromus mcgregori Chant and T. occidentalis Nesbitt were observed on the apple leaves, under the bark, and occasionally in the litter and soil. Amblyseius cucumeris (Oudemans) occurred in the soil and litter and occasionally under bark. T. mcgregori was dominant in the unsprayed orchards, and T. occidentalis in the sprayed. Of the phytophagous mites, which served as food for the phytoseiids, the two-spotted mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch was dominant. Other phytophagous mites were the brown mite, <b>Bryobia</b> rubrioculus (Scheuten), the European red mite, Panonychus ulmi (Koch), and the McDaniel mite, Tetranychus mcdanieli McGregor. The study suggests T. mcgregori to be a non-specific, facultative predator of phytophagous mites. T. mcgregori was adversely affected by standard pesticide practices, but T. occiden talis survived in larger numbers. The phytoseiids seem well adjusted to {{the environment of the}} unsprayed orchards and to contribute to the low phytophagous mite populations in those orchards. In the sprayed orchards, the phytoseiids failed to control the high populations of phytophagous mites which developed. No statistical differences were found in the efficiencies of the mite brushing machine and Berlese funnels in removing either phytoseiid or phytophagous mites from apple leaves...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the seasonal population dynamics of spider mites [Panonychus ulmi (Koch), Amphitetranychus viennensis (Zacher), <b>Bryobia</b> rubrioculus (Scheuten) ] and their natural enemies [Kampimodromus aberrans (Oudemans), Acari, Phytoseiidae; Zetzellia mali (Ewing), Acari, Stigmaeidae; and Stethorus punctillum Weise, Coleoptera, Coccinellidae] on Golden Delicious and Starking Delicious apple cultivars in three apple orchards of Van, Turkey, during 2002 – 2003. Surveys were carried out weekly from May to November in sprayed and unsprayed apple orchards. The results of study indicated that the population densities of spider mites began to increase generally in early May, reached the maximum level from mid June to late August and persisted until late September in both years. During 2002 the dominant species on both apple cultivars was P. ulmi, whereas in 2003 it was A. viennensis. In this two-year period, the population densities of P. ulmi and A. viennensis reached the maximum level of 318. 1 and 427. 2 mites per leaf, respectively, in sprayed orchards. In unsprayed orchard, spider mites remained at very low levels because of the presence of K. aberrans which was the only predator of spider mites. On the other hand, in sprayed orchards, although S. punctillum and Z. mali were the most abundant predatory species on spider mites, they could not control them in either apple cultivar and years...|$|E
