5|$|By this time, on {{both the}} Eastern and Western Front, the {{activities}} of the SS were <b>becoming</b> <b>clear</b> to the Allies, as the concentration and extermination camps were being overrun.

5|$|In 1949, {{as it was}} <b>becoming</b> <b>clear</b> that Mao Zedong's Communists {{were winning}} the Chinese Civil War, Xu Lai moved her family from Shanghai to British Hong Kong, while Tang Shengming went to Changsha to join the {{surrender}} of Hunan Governor Cheng Qian to the Communists. His brother Tang Shengzhi also surrendered. In 1950, Tang Shengming was appointed deputy commander of 21st Group Army of the People's Liberation Army and fought battles against the Kuomintang troops in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces.|$|E
5|$|In August and September, Edward and Simpson cruised the Eastern Mediterranean on {{the steam}} yacht Nahlin. By October it was <b>becoming</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the new}} king planned to marry Simpson, {{especially}} when divorce proceedings between the Simpsons were brought at Ipswich Assizes. Preparations for all contingencies were made, including {{the prospect of the}} coronation of King Edward and Queen Wallis. Because of the religious implications of any marriage, plans were made to hold a secular coronation ceremony, not in the traditional religious location of Westminster Abbey, but in the Banqueting House in Whitehall.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1467, there were rumours that Warwick was now {{sympathetic}} to the Lancastrian cause, but even though he refused to come to court to answer the charges, the king accepted his denial in writing. In July the same year, {{it was revealed that}} Warwick's deputy in Calais, John, Lord Wenlock, was involved in a Lancastrian conspiracy, and early in 1469 another Lancastrian plot was uncovered, involving John de Vere, Earl of Oxford. It was <b>becoming</b> <b>clear</b> that the discontent with Edward's reign was widespread, a fact that Warwick could exploit.|$|E
5|$|It was <b>becoming</b> <b>clear</b> {{that federal}} {{intervention}} {{was required to}} settle the dispute, despite the general policy of the Grant administration {{to stay out of}} the affairs of Southern states. The President often expressed annoyance with Southern governors who requested help from federal troops to combat regular waves of election year violence, with little compassion for the issues they faced. Grant and the United States Attorney General, George Henry Williams, issued a joint communique supporting Baxter and ordering Brooks to vacate the capitol. They also referred the dispute back to the State Legislature.|$|E
5|$|To {{add to the}} debate, it was <b>becoming</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the}} missile gap was fictional. The first Corona spy {{satellite}} mission in August 1960 put limits on their program {{that appeared to be}} well below the lower bound of any of the estimates, and a follow-up mission in late 1961 clearly demonstrated the US had a massive strategic lead. A new intelligence report published in 1961 reported that the Soviets had no more than 25 ICBMs and {{would not be able to}} add more for some time.|$|E

5|$|An area {{of current}} {{investigation}} in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations. This research addresses {{the origin and}} evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features. These {{studies have shown that}} evolution can alter development to produce new structures, such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle ear in mammals. It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes, such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles. It is now <b>becoming</b> <b>clear</b> that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a small set of conserved genes.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of {{the fossil}} record {{continued}} to advance rapidly {{during the first few}} decades of the 19th century. By the 1840s, the outlines of the geologic timescale were <b>becoming</b> <b>clear,</b> and in 1841 John Phillips named three major eras, based on the predominant fauna of each: the Paleozoic, dominated by marine invertebrates and fish, the Mesozoic, the age of reptiles, and the current Cenozoic age of mammals. This progressive picture of the history of life was accepted even by conservative English geologists like Adam Sedgwick and William Buckland; however, like Cuvier, they attributed the progression to repeated catastrophic episodes of extinction followed by new episodes of creation. Unlike Cuvier, Buckland and some other advocates of natural theology among British geologists made efforts to explicitly link the last catastrophic episode proposed by Cuvier to the biblical flood.|$|E
5|$|Hamence scored 58 and 45 in {{his first}} match upon return to Australia, playing for Bradman's XI against a team captained by Lindsay Hassett on 3 December 1948. He then scored a career best 173 against New South Wales, and 55 the {{following}} match against Queensland. He then faced Western Australia for his 91st first-class match, scoring another century when he hit 117 against Western Australia. Hamence then suffered a loss of form, not exceeding 31 for 11innings. He scored a 53 against New South Wales, 64notout against Queensland and 58 against Victoria, however he then scored nine, one and five in his next three innings. A 48 and 78 against New South Wales and Western Australia followed, however it was <b>becoming</b> <b>clear</b> that his form was waning. Hamence played his final match against Freddie Brown's MCC team on 27 October 1950, scoring 114 in the first innings as South Australia reached 350, and then seven in his final innings before being run out by Bob Berry. His final full season saw him score 418runs at 32.15.|$|E

5|$|The Athenian {{politician}} Philocrates {{had suggested}} offering Philip peace in 348 BC, during the Olynthian war. However, the Athenian assembly had effectively rejected this proposal by putting Philocrates on trial, {{and by the}} time he was cleared of the charges, it was too late to save Olynthos. The war between Athens and Philip thus continued through 347 BC, as did the Sacred War. In 347 BC, Philip sent privateers to attack Athenians colonies on various Aegean islands. Meanwhile, it was <b>becoming</b> <b>clear</b> that the Sacred War could only be ended by outside intervention. The Phocians had occupied several Boeotian cities, but were running out of treasure to pay their mercenaries; conversely, the Thebans were unable to act effectively against the Phocians. The Phocian general Phalaikos was removed from his command in 347 BC, and three new generals appointed, who successfully attacked Boeotia again. The Thebans appealed to Philip for aid, and he sent a small force to their assistance. Philip sent force enough to honour his alliance with Thebes, but not enough to end the war—he desired the glory of ending the war personally, in the manner of his choosing, and on his terms.|$|E
