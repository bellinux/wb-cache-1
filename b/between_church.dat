5|$|Christianity {{led to the}} {{development}} of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection <b>between</b> <b>Church</b> and State, a legacy of Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the highway}} {{was taken over by}} the state of New York in the 1910s and 1920s. In 1908, the section of modern NY250 in Fairport <b>between</b> <b>Church</b> and High Streets became part of Route20, an {{unsigned}} legislative route assigned by the New York State Legislature. The definition of the route was altered in 1921, taking the route on a more southerly course that used the portion of what is now NY250 between NY31 and NY31F instead through eastern Monroe County. NY250 was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.|$|E
5|$|Cẩn was {{considered}} the most secular of the four Ngô brothers who controlled Vietnam's domestic affairs. With the appointment of elder brother Thục as the Archbishop of Huế in 1961, Cẩn became less influential as Thục aggressively blurred the distinction <b>between</b> <b>church</b> and state. In early 1963, Nhu sent an emissary from Saigon telling Cẩn to retire and leave for Japan. Unrest erupted {{in the summer of}} 1963. After the flying of Vatican flags was permitted at a celebration for the anniversary of Thục's consecration as a bishop, the flying of Buddhist flags on 8 May to commemorate Vesak — the birth of Gautama Buddha — was banned. Cẩn's subordinates ordered government forces to fire on the unarmed Buddhist crowd protesting the ban, killing nine. Cẩn believed the United States, whose relations with South Vietnam had become strained, caused an explosion during the Vesak shootings, to destabilise his family's regime.|$|E

5|$|Europe was {{immersed}} in power struggles on many different fronts. The Christian Church split along Latin Orthodox lines in 1054 after centuries of disagreement {{leading to a}} permanent division called the East–West Schism. Following the Gregorian Reform, an assertive, reformist papacy attempted to increase its power and influence over the laity. Beginning around 1075 and continuing during the First Crusade, the Investiture Controversy was a power struggle <b>between</b> <b>Church</b> and state in medieval Europe over whether the Catholic Church or the Holy Roman Empire held the right to appoint church officials and other clerics. Antipope Clement III was an alternative pope {{for most of this}} period, and Pope Urban spent much of his early pontificate in exile from Rome. The result was intense piety and an increased interest in religious affairs amongst the general population in Catholic Europe and religious propaganda by the Papacy advocating a just war to reclaim Palestine from the Muslims. Participation in a crusade was seen as a form of penance that could counterbalance sin.|$|E
5|$|NY31F {{originally}} {{ran through}} the center of Fairport, turning north at NY250 and sharing Main Street with NY250 on a short concurrency <b>between</b> <b>Church</b> Street and High Street. NY31F turned east at High Street and followed it to Turk Hill Road, where NY31F continued east on its current alignment. The route was realigned onto its current alignment through Fairport on April1, 1984, {{as a result of a}} highway maintenance swap between the state of New York and the village of Fairport. In the swap, ownership and maintenance of High Street was transferred from the state to Fairport in exchange for control over the portion of East Church Street between NY250 and Turk Hill Road.|$|E
5|$|On September20, 1907, {{the state}} of New York let a {{contract}} for a project to improve Church Road, the section of Redman Road north of Church Road, and the portion of Lake Road West Fork <b>between</b> <b>Church</b> Road and Lake Road to state highway standards. The project was completed by mid-1909, and the highways, collectively inventoried as State Highway286 (SH286), {{were added to the}} state highway system on July20, 1909. On June8, 1915, the state awarded another contract to bring Morton Road up to state highway standards. Work on the road, internally designated as SH1282, was completed that year, allowing for the highway {{to be added to the}} state highway system on December8, 1915. The first set of posted state routes in New York were assigned in 1924; however, no designations were assigned to either of the aforementioned highways at this time.|$|E

5|$|Stations {{along the}} three-tracked {{stretch of the}} Culver Line are being renovated until early 2018 (excluding Ditmas Avenue and the {{northbound}} platform of Avenue X, which were rehabilitated in 2015–2016), with the center track being used to bypass closed stations. The Coney Island-bound platforms were rehabiliated between June 7, 2016 and May 1, 2017 (May 8 for Avenue U and Avenue X). During {{the second phase of}} the project, beginning on May 22, 2017, the Manhattan-bound platforms will be closed between Avenue U and 18th Avenue until early 2018. Even after the rehabilitation, though, peak-direction express service <b>between</b> <b>Church</b> Avenue and Kings Highway will not be restored due to limitations caused by current track configurations, as the switches at Kings Highway previously used were removed in the 1990s. The interlocking at Kings Highway is scheduled to be modernized as part of the 2020–2024 MTA Capital Plan, and the modernization could include the reinstallation of the necessary track switches.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Union {{that led}} to the {{formation}} of the Kingdom of Great Britain ensured that there would be a Protestant succession as well as a link <b>between</b> <b>church</b> and state that still remains. The Church of England (Anglican) is legally recognised as the established church, and so retains representation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom through the Lords Spiritual, whilst the British monarch is a member of the church as well as its Supreme Governor. The Church of England also retains the right to draft legislative measures (related to religious administration) through the General Synod that can then be passed into law by Parliament. The Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales is the second largest Christian church with around five million members, mainly in England. There are also growing Orthodox, Evangelical and Pentecostal churches, with Pentecostal churches in England now third after the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church in terms of church attendance. Other large Christian groups include Methodists and Baptists.|$|E
5|$|The {{relation}} {{of church and}} state in Zwingli's mind is best represented in a statue by the Wasserkirche, where he stands with a Bible {{in one hand and a}} sword in the other. For him, the church and state are one under the sovereign rule of God. The development of the complex relationship <b>between</b> <b>church</b> and state in Zwingli's view can only be understood by examining the context of his life, the city of Zürich, and the wider Swiss Confederation. His earliest writings before he became a reformer, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), reveal a patriotic love of his land, a longing for liberty, and opposition to the mercenary service where young Swiss citizens were sent to fight in foreign wars for the financial benefit of the state government. His life as a parish priest and an army chaplain helped to develop his concern for morality and justice. He saw his ministry not limited to a private sphere, but to the people as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Like the old revolutionary States-General, the new National Assembly {{contained}} radically opposed parties: the unitary democrats, led by Pieter Vreede, Johan Valckenaer and Pieter Paulus, and the federalists, such as Jacob Abraham de Mist and Gerard Willem van Marle. But {{there was}} a broad continuum of opinion between these poles. In this force-field the federalists held the upper hand after the sudden demise of Paulus (who might otherwise have acted as a unifier). The conservative federalists were more adept at parliamentary manoeuvering (Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck proved himself especially adept at this). The frustration this engendered among the democrats led them to appeal to popular opinion and to extra-parliamentary action. Meanwhile, the Assembly installed a constitutional commission that in November 1796 presented a report that amounted to {{a continuation of the}} old federal arrangements. As this was totally unacceptable to the unitarists, this draft was subsequently amended into its opposite, by a compromise that finally formed a basis for a new Constitution. The Assembly now started upon a discussion of other important matters, like the separation <b>between</b> <b>church</b> and state, and the emancipation of minorities. The organs of the state were to be a bicameral Legislative Corps, to be elected in indirect elections, and a Directoire-like Executive of five members. The end result looked much like the French Constitution of 1795. This was approved by the Assembly on 10 May 1797.|$|E
5|$|On November 26, 1967, the Chrystie Street Connection {{opened and}} D trains were rerouted via the Manhattan Bridge and the BMT Brighton Line to Coney Island. F trains were {{extended}} once again via the Culver Line. From June 1968 to 1987, the Culver Line featured express service during rush hours. F trains ran express {{in both directions}} between Bergen Street and Church Avenue, while G trains were extended from Smith–Ninth Streets to Church Avenue to provide local service. Express service on the elevated portion of the line to Kings Highway operated in the peak direction (to Manhattan AM; to Brooklyn PM), with some F trains running local and some running express. Express service between Bergen and Church ended in 1976, and <b>between</b> <b>Church</b> and Kings Highway in 1987, largely due to budget constraints and complaints from passengers at local stations. Express service on the elevated Culver Line was ended due to necessary structural work, but never restored. With the end of express service, Bergen Street's lower level {{was taken out of}} service. Following renovations to the station in the 1990s, the lower level was converted into storage space and is not usable for passenger service in its current state.|$|E
