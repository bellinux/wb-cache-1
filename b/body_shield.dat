40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} {{distribution}} of remaining oil inside meandering channel sand body, the size of sand body architecture was calculated {{by the use of}} sedimentary facies, dense well, river parameters, cores, well logs and other data. The architecture of meandering channel that was crescent-shaped in plane and diagonal type in section was identifiable. On the base of study of architecture, the shielding of interlayer was classified into four types by the observation of oiliness interlayer. Framework of seepage flow was identified in meandering channel sand body. Several lateral accretion bodies between the completely choked interlayer constituted the flow unit. Combined with core analysis, the remaining oil in meandering channel sand body distributed in the upper and the middle of flow unit which did not connect with production well. The oil displacement efficiency in the flow unit was a positive rhythm in the flow unit. The oil displacement efficiency was a high-contrast positive rhythm in the lateral accretion <b>body</b> <b>shielded</b> by completely choked interlayer. That was a low-contrast positive rhythm in the lateral accretion <b>body</b> <b>shielded</b> by partly choked or restricted interlayer. All of these would provide guidance for developing the remaining oil...|$|R
5000|$|Body armour made a brief reappearance in the American Civil War {{with mixed}} success. During World War I, both sides experimented with {{shrapnel}} armour and some soldiers used their own dedicated ballistic armour {{such as the}} American Brewster <b>Body</b> <b>Shield,</b> although none were widely produced.In 1916 General Adrian of the French army provided an abdominal shield which was light in weight (approx. one kilogram) and easy to wear.A number of British officers recognised that many casualties could be avoided if effective armour were available[...]|$|E
50|$|The first {{official}} attempts at commissioning body armor {{were made in}} 1915 by the British Army Design Committee, in particular a 'Bomber's Shield' {{for the use of}} bomber pilots who were notoriously under-protected in the air from anti-aircraft bullets and shrapnel. The Experimental Ordnance Board also reviewed potential materials for bullet and fragment proof armor, such as steel plate. A 'necklet' was successfully issued on a small scale (due to cost considerations), which protected the neck and shoulders from bullets traveling at 600 feet per second with interwoven layers of silk and cotton stiffened with resin. The Dayfield <b>body</b> <b>shield</b> entered service in 1916 and a hardened breastplate was introduced the following year.|$|E

50|$|Amblyseius orientalis is {{a species}} of predatory mite {{belonging}} to the family Phytoseiidae. This oval, greyish white mite is very small; the female is around 380 μm in length and the male is even smaller at around 280 μm. Both sexes are notable for the very long setae {{on the margins of}} the body and on the fourth pair of legs.

The heavy infantry fought in a dense phalanx, armed with heavy throwing spears, long <b>body</b> <b>shields</b> and short thrusting swords. Sardinian and Gallic infantry fought in their native gear, but often were equipped by Carthage.|$|R
5000|$|The weapon {{collection}} in Schloss Sigmaringen contains over 3000 different examples {{of weapons and}} armor. [...] Prince Karl Anton's passion for collecting weapons resulted {{in the creation of}} this collection. The collection shows the evolution of weapons from the 14th century to the 20th century. In addition to weapons, the collection also includes protective items such as shields, armor and handguns. Particularly noteworthy are such rare objects dating from the 15th century as a German multi-barrel gun, a <b>body</b> <b>shield</b> and a richly engraved helmet once belonging to a royal bodyguard from ca.1622.

50|$|The {{relatively}} simplistic combat {{mechanics of}} Syndicate Wars {{do not provide}} much scope for sophistication in infantry tactics. Combat tactics in the game are usually centered on maneuvering to attack small portions (ideally one or two agents) of the opposing force at a time, with intervals in between for regeneration of health, <b>body</b> <b>shield</b> strength and ammunition energy by one's own agents. With only four controllable agents, the player's own forces are almost always outnumbered, and hence most combat strategy is {{simply a matter of}} possessing superior weaponry while avoiding encirclement or confrontation with large numbers of enemies simultaneously. Some missions however require multiple objectives to be completed simultaneously, and therefore require the team to be split up into pairs or even individual agents. In some instances, use of terrain can be significant, such as when attempting to approach a target while remaining immune to long-range small arms fire, or when attempting to ensure an open field of engagement in which to use area of effect weapons.|$|E

He started his radio career in 1978 enacting {{the role of a}} language-student in India's longest-running language teaching radio-play series Hindi Sikshar Paath, and continued performing that role for eight years till 1985. In 1985, AIR offered him the first live broadcast opportunity of world news round-up called Biswa Sangbad for which he was a Radio Journalist collecting world news, News Editor compiling and editing the news items and News Reader. He also conducted a village field-research based rural documentary programme for radio titled Gaawe Gaawe in 1986, for which he had to travel around rural India to collect interviews of village-dwellers and also discovered rural musical talents like folk-singers and gave them a national audience by recording and broadcasting their music. He also regularly took part in radio talk shows and discussions on contemporary youth and young-adult related issues at several radio stations in Guwahati and Jorhat. Apart from writing his first radio-play Mukti('Freedom') as a ninth standard school student, which was first broadcast over radio in 1981, he was also a regular actor of many popular radio-plays in several languages including Assamese, Urdu and Hindi in 1970s and 1980s. Some of his radio acting credits include Pratham Sakhyatkaar ('First Meet'), Kabach ('The Protective <b>Body</b> <b>Shield</b> Garment'), Mukti ('Freedom'), Maitree ('The Harmony'), Idd Mubaraq ('Greetings of Islamic festival Idd').|$|E
40|$|Phantom torso {{experiments}} have been flown {{on the space}} shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) providing validation data for radiation transport models of organ dose and dose equivalents. We describe results for space radiation organ doses using a new human geometry model based on detailed Voxel phantoms models denoted {{for males and females}} as MAX (Male Adult voXel) and Fax (Female Adult voXel), respectively. These models represent the human body with much higher fidelity than the CAMERA model currently used at NASA. The MAX and FAX models were implemented for the evaluation of directional <b>body</b> <b>shielding</b> mass for over 1500 target points of major organs. Radiation exposure to solar particle events (SPE), trapped protons, and galactic cosmic rays (GCR) were assessed at each specific site in the human body by coupling space radiation transport models with the detailed <b>body</b> <b>shielding</b> mass of MAX/FAX phantom. The development of multiple-point body-shielding distributions at each organ site made it possible to estimate the mean and variance of space dose equivalents at the specific organ. For the estimate of doses to the blood forming organs (BFOs), active marrow distributions in adult were accounted at bone marrow sites over the human body. We compared the current model results to space shuttle and ISS phantom torso experiments and to calculations using the CAMERA model...|$|R

Pusha T responded to the diss track when he appeared on Chicago’s 107.5 WGCI’s The Morning Riot and said nobody is looking for Consequence, as for if he would respond on a record, Pusha T went on to say [...] "At {{the end of the day}} I am an artist and this whole rap thing is fun to me, so I can't say you won't hear nothing, but to go back and forth with him, it's not right, I won't get anything out of it." [...] Later that day, Consequence called in to Chicago’s WGCI’s The Morning Riot in retaliation to the remarks Pusha T made about him. He also premiered a song titled [...] "Everybody Told Me 2 (Straighten It Out)" [...] where he disses West, Pusha T and GOOD Music in general. Since then Pusha T has responded to Consequence on a record. The song was the remix to Ace Hood's [...] "Go 'N' Get It" [...] which also featured Beanie Sigel, Busta Rhymes and Styles P. In the song Pusha raps [...] "Consequence, nigga, talk is cheap You don't want a problem? Off the beef Before I off his ass with his awful teeth". On August 19, Consequence released Movies on Demand 3 and continued to diss his former label and Pusha T on songs such as [...] "Career Killer" [...] and [...] "Mr.RapFix (Hot Water)".
