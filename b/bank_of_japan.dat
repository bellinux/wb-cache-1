A multivariate cointegration analy-sis <b>of</b> <b>Japans</b> time series data over the past two decades shows that the term spread (the di¤erence between long-term and short-term interest rates) and various di¤u-sion indices in the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japans</b> business survey tend to synchronise with 8 ̆ 5 xed investment. The term spread and di¤usion indices are then all judged to be weakly exogenous for parameters of interest, allowing us to estimate a single-equation equi-librium correction model for 8 ̆ 5 xed investment.

In contrast to prior estimations of reaction functions based on the Taylor-rule, we allow for regime shifts by estimating rolling coefficients from January 1974 to March 1999. The results show a temporary impact of the exchange rate on monetary policy around 1978 / 79 and a persistently increasing impact of the yen/dollar exchange rate after 1986. The ris ing importance of the yen/dollar exchange rate for Japanese monetary policy is in line with increasing efforts to stabilize the yen/dollar exchange rate by foreign exchange intervention after March 1999, when the nominal interest rate reached the zero boundary.

The results are from strong balanced panel data set spanning 11 years around the period from 2002 to 2012. Fixed effect model and Ordinary Least Squares are used for the estimation. Return on Asset (ROA) is set as the dependent variable, and Capital Adequacy Ratio, Non-perming loans to gross loan ratio, natural logarithm of gross loans, Loan loss provision to non-perming loan ratio, GDPgrowth rate and inflation are set as independent variables.
