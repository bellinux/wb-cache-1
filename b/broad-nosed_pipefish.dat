Chlamydia-related bacteria are also major fish pathogens, infecting epithelial cells of the gills and skin to cause the disease epitheliocystis.

The <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>pipefish</b> (Syngnathus typhle) is a widely distributed and genetically diverse temperate fish species, susceptible to epitheliocystis across much of its range.

40|$|We {{explored}} {{the effects of}} multiple mates on male reproductive success in a species with male parental care in which {{an increase in the}} number of female mating partners does not increase the number of eggs received. The <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>pipefish</b> (Syngnathus typhle) has a polygynandrous mating system. In this species, the male cares for embryos in a specially developed brood pouch. During brooding, some embryos fail to develop. We experimentally mated males with either one or two females while keeping brood size similar. We found that broods of singly mated males showed significantly lower embryo survival than those of doubly mated males. Furthermore, larger broods showed relatively lower levels of embryo survivorship independent of number of mates. We conclude that embryo survival is affected by postcopulatory processes that appear to result in higher fitness of multiply mated males. We discuss our results in the light of parental care, sibling competition, genetic benefits, and kin selection. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{differential}} allocation hypothesis {{assumes that}} animals should weigh {{costs and benefits}} of investing into reproduction with a current mate against the expected quality of future mates, and predicts that they should invest more into reproduction when pairing with a high-quality mate. In the <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>pipefish</b> (Syngnathus typhle), males care for the embryos in a brood pouch and females compete for access to male mating partners. Both sexes prefer mating with large partners. In the present study, we show that the same female provides both large and small mating partners with eggs of similar size, weight and lipid content when mated to two males in succession. Importantly, however, eggs provided to small males (less preferred) had higher egg protein content (11 % more) than those provided to large males (preferred). Thus, contrary to the differential allocation hypothesis, eggs did not contain more resources when females mated with a larger male. Instead, the pattern observed in our results is consistent with a compensatory reproductive strategy...|$|E
40|$|From an {{evolutionary}} and adaptive perspective, the occurrence {{and extent of}} parental care in animals (investment in offspring beyond the genetic contribution) is expected to depend on an optimal (fitness-maximizing) balance of its costs and benefits. Males of the sex-role reversed <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>pipefish,</b> Syngnathus typhle, which care for eggs and embryos and may perform brood reduction, are particularly interesting in this respect. In this thesis, I explore paternal care in the <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>pipefish</b> with special focus on the causes and consequences of brood reduction. Firstly, I demonstrate that brooding males absorb nutrients from reduced embryos in their brood pouch, presumably benefiting their own nutrition. This indicates that brood reduction in this species is similar to filial cannibalism (eating of own young), found in many other fish species with paternal care. Furthermore, as the embryos did not absorb nutrients originating from siblings in the same pouch, there is no support for ‘nurse eggs’ in this pipefish species (paper I). When comparing brooding males with non-brooding males, brooding males were on average in better condition, as measured by hepatosomatic index (HSI). This {{is contrary to the}} expectation that the metabolic and other costs of brooding males should deplete their energy reserves. However, given the results above (paper I), the higher HSI in brooding males may to some extent stem from nutrients acquired through brood reduction (paper V). This uptake is, however, unlikely to fully compensate for the costs of paternal care since another experiment (paper IV) showed that males brooding full broods had lower survival, despite a larger relative brood reduction, compared to males with half-sized broods (paper V). Furthermore, the more eggs a male received, the more eggs were reduced, which supports the indication that the cost of brooding is related to brood size (paper II and IV). This clearly indicates that embryos are competing over paternal care and that paternal care is a costly and limiting resource. Costs of paternal care in terms of reduced energy reserves (HSI) and lower survival (paper IV) suggests that males in poor condition (low HSI) should have a lower optimal brood size and thus show a larger relative brood reduction, as found in paper III. Also, males with low HSI received fewer eggs at mating and were more likely to suffer mortality from an infection (paper III). When comparing monogynously and polygynously mated males, only monogynous males showed significant brood reduction, whereas polygynous males did not (paper II). This may be caused by either increased paternal provision or less competition due to less overlapping needs within half-sib than full-sib broods. Also, broods from larger females survived better than broods from smaller females (paper III and V). This may show that large eggs have certain qualities which allow them to survive better, or that males provide better care to eggs from larger females, reflecting the sexual conflict of embryo competition and cryptic male choice that may be operating in this species. In summary, I have found that several factors influence the process of brood reduction (filial cannibalism) in the <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>pipefish.</b> These factors include the number of female mating partners, brood size, egg size and male condition. Consequently, these factors are important in parental conflicts and parent-offspring conflicts over the level of parental care and brood reduction...|$|E
40|$|A parent's {{nutritional}} state may influence {{its ability to}} provide care to offspring and ability to handle infections. In the <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>pipefish,</b> Syngnathus typhle, males care for their offspring by brooding the developing embryos in a brood pouch, providing nutrients and oxygen, resembling a pregnancy. Here, we demonstrate that the {{nutritional state}} of pregnant males covaries with their own survival during a selective event. Brooding males surviving a Vibrio sp. infection were in a significantly better nutritional state, as estimated by their hepatosomatic index. Furthermore, a higher nutritional state of the brooding male correlated with a lower embryo mortality, while feeding treatment (low vs. high) {{had no effect on}} male survival, nutritional state or embryo mortality. Finally, males brooding heavier embryos also showed a lower embryo mortality. This may reflect a maternal effect (if large eggs result in higher embryo survival), a paternal effect (if higher provisioning of male care promotes both embryo growth and survival), or a combination thereof (males caring more for large embryos). The results demonstrate the importance of a good nutritional state for a caring parent when their immunity is challenged...|$|E
40|$|Algal induced {{turbidity}} {{has been}} shown to alter several important aspects of reproduction and sexual selection. However, while turbidity {{has been shown}} to negatively affect reproduction and sexually selected traits in some species, it may instead enhance reproductive success in others, implying that the impact of eutrophication is far more complex than originally believed. In this study, we aimed to provide more insight into these inconsistent findings. We used molecular tools to investigate the impact of algal turbidity on reproductive success and sexual selection on males in controlled laboratory experiments, allowing mate choice, mating competition and mate encounter rates to affect reproduction. As study species we used the <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>pipefish,</b> Syngnathus typhle, a species practicing male pregnancy and where we have previously shown that male mate choice is impaired by turbidity. Here, turbidity instead enhanced sexual selection on male size and mating success as well as reproductive success. Effects from mating competition and mate encounter rates may thus override effects from mate choice based on visual cues, producing an overall stronger sexual selection in turbid waters. Hence, seemingly inconsistent effects of turbidity on sexual selection may depend on which mechanisms of sexual selection that have been under study...|$|E
40|$|Extreme climate {{events such}} as heat waves are {{expected}} to increase in frequency under global change. As one indirect effect, they can alter magnitude and direction of species interactions, for example those between hosts and parasites. We simulated a summer heat wave to investigate how a changing environment affects {{the interaction between the}} <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>pipefish</b> (Syngnathus typhle) as a host and its digenean trematode parasite (Cryptocotyle lingua). In a fully reciprocal laboratory infection experiment, pipefish from three different coastal locations were exposed to sympatric and allopatric trematode cercariae. In order to examine whether an extreme climatic event disrupts patterns of locally adapted host-parasite combinations we measured the parasite’s transmission success as well as the host’s adaptive and innate immune defence under control and heat wave conditions. Independent of temperature, sympatric cercariae were always more successful than allopatric ones, indicating that parasites are locally adapted to their hosts. Hosts suffered from heat stress as suggested by fewer cells of the adaptive immune system (lymphocytes) compared to the same groups that were kept at 18 uC. However, the proportion of the innate immune cells (monocytes) was higher in the 18 uC water. Contrary to ou...|$|E
40|$|Offspring fitness {{generally}} improves {{with increasing}} egg size. Yet, eggs of most aquatic organisms are small. A common but largely untested {{assumption is that}} larger embryos require more oxygen than they can acquire through diffusion via the egg surface, constraining egg size evolution. However, we found no detrimental effects of large egg size on embryo growth and survival under hypoxic conditions. We tested this in the <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>pipefish,</b> Syngnathus typhle, whose males provide extensive care (nourishment, osmoregulation and oxygenation) to their young in a brood pouch on their bodies. We took advantage of this species’ pronounced variation in egg size, correlating positively with female size, and tested the effect of hypoxia (40 % dissolved oxygen) versus fully oxygenated (100 %) water on embryo size and survival of large versus small eggs after 18 days of paternal brooding. Egg size did not affect embryo survival, regardless of O 2 treatment. While hypoxia affected embryo size negatively, {{both large and small}} eggs showed similar reductions in growth. Males in hypoxia ventilated more and males with large eggs swam more, but neither treatment affected their position in the water column. Overall, our results call into question the most common explanation for constrained egg size evolution in aquatic environments...|$|E
40|$|In {{species that}} provide parental care, {{individuals}} should invest adaptively in their offspring {{in relation to}} the preand post-zygotic care provided by their partners. In the <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>pipefish,</b> Syngnathus typhle L., females transfer large, nutrient-rich eggs into the male brood pouch during mating. The male broods and nourishes the embryos for several weeks before independent juveniles emerge at parturition. Given a choice, females clearly prefer large partners. Yet, females provide protein-richer eggs when the same individual mates with a smaller than a larger male. In the present study, we allowed each female to mate with one small and one large male, in alternated order. We found a strong effect of female mating order, with larger clutches and higher embryo mortality in first- than second-laid broods, which may suggest that eggs over-ripen in the ovaries or reflect the negative effects of high embryo density in the brood pouch. In either case, this effect should put constraints on the possibility of a female being selective in mate choice. We also found that small and large males produced embryos of similar size and survival, consistent with the reproductive compensation hypothesis, suggesting that, in this species, larger males provide better nourishment to the embryos than smaller males...|$|E
40|$|In diverse animal species, from insects to mammals, females {{display a}} more {{efficient}} immune defence than males. Bateman’s principle posits that males maximize their fitness by increasing mating frequency whereas females gain fitness benefits by maximizing their lifespan. As a longer lifespan requires {{a more efficient}} immune system, these implications of Bateman’s principle may explain widespread immune dimorphism among animals. Because in most extant animals, the provisioning of eggs and a higher parental investment are attributes of the female sex, sex-role reversed species provide {{a unique opportunity to}} assess whether or not immune dimorphism depends on life history and not on sex per se. In the <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>pipefish</b> Syngnathus typhle, males brood and nourish the eggs in a ventral pouch and thus invest more into reproduction than females. We found males to have a more active immune response both in field data from four populations and also in an experiment under controlled laboratory conditions. This applied to different measures of immunocompetence using innate as well as adaptive immune system traits. We further determined the specificity of immune response initiation after a fully factorial primary and secondary exposure to a common marine pathogen Vibrio spp. Males not only had a more active but also a more specific immune defence than females. Our results thus indeed suggest that the sex that invests more into the offspring has the stronger immune defence...|$|E
40|$|The {{operational}} {{sex ratio}} (ratio of sexually receptive males to females) {{has been extensively}} studied in behavioral ecology, whereas other demographic {{factors such as the}} effect of density on mating behavior have received less empirical attention. We manipulated mating competition by establishing breeding populations of the sex-role reversed <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>pipefish</b> (Syngnathus typhle) at 2 sex ratios (male biased or female biased) and 2 densities. We used mean crowding (m*) and the index of association (X) to measure spatial distributions within and between the sexes, respectively, and investigated how these measures reflect the predicted strength of mating competition. In general, female m* increased as fewer males were available for mating, which suggests increased intrasexual competition in the most competitive sex. However, male m* also increased as the operational sex ratio became more female biased, suggesting that m* did not reflect mating competition for males. Association between the sexes (X) was higher under male bias than female bias, probably because males were still available for mating under male bias. In addition, X decreased in the female-biased treatment as the operational sex ratio became even more female biased. Higher density increased m* in both sex ratios and sexes, although for both sexes in the female-biased high-density treatment the operational sex ratio did not influence m*, probably because female–female competition inhibits further crowding in this treatment. In this study, we show that the use of m* and X can be a useful tool in behavioral studies but their interpretation requires detailed information about the mating system. Therefore, we recommend caution with their broadscale application...|$|E
40|$|The {{pipefish}} brood pouch {{presents a}} unique mode of parental care that enables males to protect, osmoregulate, nourish and oxygenate the developing young. Using {{a very fine}} O 2 probe, we assessed {{the extent to which}} males of the <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>pipefish</b> (Syngnathus typhle) oxygenate the developing embryos and are able to maintain pouch fluid O 2 levels when brooding in normoxia (100 % O 2 saturation) and hypoxia (40 % O 2 saturation) for 24 days. In both treatments, pouch fluidO 2 saturation levels were lower compared with the surrounding water and decreased throughout the brooding period, reflecting greater offspring demand for O 2 during development and/or decreasing paternal ability to provide O 2 to the embryos. Male condition (hepatosomatic index) was negatively affected by hypoxia. Larger males had higher pouch fluid O 2 saturation levels compared with smaller males, and levels were higher in the bottom section of the pouch compared with other sections. Embryo size was positively correlated with O 2 availability, irrespective of their position in the pouch. Two important conclusions can be drawn from our findings. First, our results highlight a potential limitation to brooding within the pouch and dismiss the notion of closed brood pouches as welloxygenated structures promoting the evolution of larger eggs in syngnathids. Second, we provide direct evidence that paternal care improves with male size in this species. This finding offers an explanation for the documented strong female preference for larger partners because, in terms of oxygenation, the brood pouch can restrict embryo growth...|$|E
40|$|Trade-offs between brood {{size and}} {{offspring}} size, offspring survival, parental condition or parental survival are classic assumptions in life history biology. A reduction in brood size may lessen these costs of care, but offspring mortality can also {{result in an}} energetic gain, if parents are able to utilize the nutrients from the demised young. Males of the <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>pipefish</b> (Syngnathus typhle) care for the offspring by brooding embryos in a brood pouch. Brooding males can absorb nutrients that emanate from embryos, and {{there is often a}} reduction in offspring number over the brooding period. In this study, using two experimentally determined brood sizes (partially and fully filled brood pouches), we found that full broods resulted in larger number of developing offspring, despite significantly higher absolute and relative embryo mortality, compared to partial broods. Male survival was also affected by brood size, with males caring for full broods having poorer survival, an effect that together with the reduced embryo survival was found to negate the benefit of large broods. We found that embryo mortality was lower when the brooding males were in good initial condition, that embryos in broods with low embryo mortality weighed more, and surprisingly, that males in higher initial condition had embryos of lower weight. Brood size, however, did not affect embryo weight. Male final condition, but not initial condition, correlated with higher male survival. Taken together, our results show costs and benefits of caring for large brood sizes, where the numerical benefits come with costs in terms of both embryo survival and survival of the brooding father, effects that are often mediated via male condition...|$|E

Significance statement Algal blooms are becoming increasingly more common due to eutrophication of freshwater and marine environments. The high density of algae lowers water transparency and reduces the possibility for fish and other aquatic animals to perform behaviors dependent on vision. We have previously shown that pipefish are unable to select the best partner in mate choice trials when water transparency was reduced. However, fish might use other senses than vision to compensate for the reduction in water transparency. In this study, we found that when fish were allowed to freely interact, thereby allowing competition between partners and direct contact between the fish, the best partner was indeed chosen. Hence, the negative effects of reduced water visibility due to algal blooms may be counteracted by the use of other senses in fish...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{processes}} that govern mating behaviors is a fundamental goal of evolutionary biology and behavioral ecology. Population-level patterns of mate acquisition and offspring production, otherwise known as the genetic mating system, {{play a central role}} in the sexual selection on morphological and behavioral traits and may facilitate speciation. The central hypothesis of this research is that variation in environmental conditions, such as temperature, turbidity, and habitat, and demographic influences such as population density, sex ratios and temporal availability of mates, may limit mating and reproductive success in a predictive manner. Therefore the goal of this dissertation is to examine the contributions of geographic and temporal variation on the plasticity of the genetic mating system in two species of pipefish. The first study examined whether meaningful variation in the genetic mating system exists between two natural populations of the dusky pipefish, Syngnathus floridae. Results of this investigation provide evidence that the genetic mating system differs among different geographic locations. The second study considered the relative contributions of environmental conditions and population demographics on differences in the genetic mating system of dusky pipefish from five natural populations. The results of this investigation show strong trends for demographic and environmental factors to strongly influence the genetic mating system between populations. The third study considered how variation in the number of available mates predicts the outcome of sexual selection during the course of a breeding season in the <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>pipefish,</b> Sygnathus typhle. The results of this study indicate a strong influence of the operational sex ratio on the genetic mating system. In addition to these studies, a study was conducted to investigate whether phylogeographic relationships may be responsible for geographic variation in the genetic mating system of the dusky pipefish of pipefish. Mitochondrial DNA analysis does not substantiate subspecies designations for this species and microsatellite analysis show a clear pattern of isolation by distance. Taken together, these studies significantly enhance the understanding of how mating systems are organized over broad environmental gradients and temporal/spatial scales and to the evolution of sexual selection on the whole...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I explore how sexual selection, sexual conflicts, {{coevolution}} with parental care and an environmental selective agent (hypoxia) affect {{the evolution of}} different egg characteristics and embryo survival and size in pipefishes (Syngnathidae). In the <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>pipefish,</b> Syngnathus typhle Linnaeus, both sexes prefer to mate with large partners; large females produce more and larger eggs and large males can care for more young, and, as shown in this thesis, invest more per embryo and provide better oxygenation during brooding. However, if given time to assess their partners prior to mating, females deposit significantly more proteins into eggs when they mate with non-preferred (smaller) males. This result suggests that females are able to improve offspring fitness by compensating for small males’ lower paternal care quality, thus reducing effects of differences in care between small and large males. The spherical shape common to fish eggs minimizes the ratio between surface area and volume. As embryo respiration {{is assumed to be}} proportional to egg volume and oxygen availability to be restricted by the surface of the egg, this shape may be unfavourable for larger eggs. In S. typhle, both small eggs and hypoxia (low ambient oxygen levels) during brooding resulted in smaller embryos, but the negative effect of hypoxia on embryo size was similar for small and large eggs. In brooding males, within-pouch oxygen levels were found to be consistently lower than those of the surrounding environment, both in high and low ambient oxygen conditions indicating a limited paternal ability to maintain high levels of oxygenation to the embryos. When comparing pipefish species with and without brood pouches, the species with pouches were found to suffer, on average, greater embryo mortalities during brooding. However, under hypoxia embryo survival and size were negatively affected both in species with and without brood pouches. Between species, large egg size resulted in significantly larger offspring, but had a negative effect on embryo survival, compared to species that produce small eggs. This thesis contributes to the understanding of egg size evolution in relation to hypoxia and paternal care in syngnathids. The studies presented here suggest that the evolution of brood pouches carries costs in terms of embryo oxygenation. Furthermore, the evolution of more complex types of brooding has potentially enabled phenotypic variation to arise in the quality of male care, in turn selecting for flexible female reproductive investment with stronger selection on egg size evolution in species with brood pouches, and greater female control of egg quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{antagonistic}} coevolution between {{hosts and}} parasite can create strong selective forces {{that may be}} responsible for an increase in parasite virulence and host immune defense. While such antagonistic interactions between two species are well understood, the interaction between more than two players is very complex and largely unexplored. A model system to go beyond typical two-species interactions is given by studying a tripartite species interaction consisting of temperate bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria), bacteria and final animal hosts. First an evolution experiment was conducted. Thereby one Vibrio strain was propagated with 3 generalist and 3 specialist phages and by means of 2 different batch cultures. In one culture (further described as evolution treatment) only the phages are able to evolve and in the second culture (further described as coevolution treatment) both players were allowed to evolve. After 24 h the first samples containing bacteria and phage isolates were collected and this sampling procedure was subsequently repeated every 48 h. This evolution experiment lasts 13 days (312 h) and results in 7 transfers The evolved and (co-) evolved phages and the co-evolved bacteria were subsequently used for further experiments to determine correlated fitness responses during phage-bacteria coevolution. Phage fitness was estimated as infectivity against 75 different Vibrio isolates. Bacterial correlated responses were estimated by means of controlled infection experiments on the final animal host, the <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>pipefish</b> Syngnathus typhle and assessed by measuring pipefish mortality, total amount of colony forming units (CFU) and gene expression of selected pipefish immune genes. Furthermore the bacterial growth rate was measured, to determine whether it is restricted as a cost of resistance against phages. In addition, to determine the underlying selective force of phage-bacteria (co-) evolution, phage infectivity as well as bacteria resistance was tested against past, contemporary and future bacteria (phages, respectively) by using a time-shift-assay. Phage host-range increases rapidly during the 24 hours of (co-) evolution. This increase includes infectivity to more bacteria from the same Vibrio clade and also to former resistant bacteria from another clade. Furthermore I observed a time-lagged antagonistic 4 correspondence between both players, with increasing phage infectivity and bacteria resistance over evolutionary time. This indicates that this coevolution is driven by directional selection, where recurrent selective sweeps lead to the accumulation of beneficial mutations. Controlled infection experiments with evolved Vibrio/phage combinations on pipefish revealed that Vibrio virulence has changed during antagonistic coevolution between Vibrio and phages. Virulence, estimated as gene expression of selected immune genes and pipefish mortality rate first decreased during (co-) evolution followed by an increase {{towards the end of the}} experiment. Furthermore CFU and bacterial growth decrease with increasing time of (co-) evolution. These results indicate that gaining resistance against phages includes a loss of virulence as well as decreasing growth rate. Those results emphasize the great complexity between more than two players and call for an integrative view that goes beyond classical two-way systems to be able understand the evolution of host-parasite interactions...|$|E
