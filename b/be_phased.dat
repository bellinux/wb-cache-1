40|$|We {{investigate}} the structural, electronic, mechanical and elastic properties of two niobium based intermetallic compounds Nb 3 Be and Nb 3 Be 2 {{by using the}} DFT based theoretical method. A good agreement is found among the structural parameters of both the phases with experimentally evaluated parameters. For both the <b>phases</b> metallic conductivity <b>is</b> observed while Nb 3 <b>Be</b> <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> more conducting than that of Nb 3 <b>Be</b> 2 <b>phase.</b> Evaluated DOS at Fermi level indicates that Nb 3 <b>Be</b> 2 <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> electrically more stable than Nb 3 <b>Be</b> <b>phase.</b> For both phases Nb- 4 d states is mostly responsible for metallic conductivity. The study of total charge density and Mulliken atomic population reveal the existence of covalent, metallic and ionic bonds in both intermetallics. Both the <b>phases</b> <b>are</b> mechanically stable in nature while Nb 3 <b>Be</b> <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> more ductile than Nb 3 <b>Be</b> 2 <b>phase.</b> The study of Vickers hardness exhibits that Nb 3 <b>Be</b> 2 <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> harder than that of Nb 3 Be. Both compounds are anisotropic in nature while Nb 3 <b>Be</b> <b>phase</b> possesses large anisotropic characteristics than that of Nb 3 <b>Be</b> 2 <b>phase.</b> The Debye temperature of both the compounds are also calculated and discussed...|$|R

The firm changed from a corporation to a share company in 1965, and changed its name from Ethiopian Air Lines to Ethiopian Airlines. By 1966, the contractual relationship with TWA was adjusted to reflect the transfer of management with the appointment of an Ethiopian deputy general manager.

5|$|As of 2012, {{renewable}} energy {{plays a major}} role in the energy mix of many countries globally. Renewables are becoming increasingly economic in both developing and developed countries. Prices for {{renewable energy}} technologies, primarily wind power and solar power, continued to drop, making renewables competitive with conventional energy sources. Without a level playing field, however, high market penetration of renewables is still dependent on a robust promotional policies. Fossil fuel subsidies, which are far higher than those for renewable energy, remain in place and quickly need to <b>be</b> <b>phased</b> out.|$|E

5|$|The 20th century saw an {{increase}} in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal. Beginning in the 1920s, lead was added to gasoline to improve its combustion; lead from this exhaust persists today in soil and dust in buildings. Blood lead levels worldwide have been declining sharply since the 1980s, when leaded gasoline began to <b>be</b> <b>phased</b> out. In those countries that have banned lead in solder for food and drink cans and have banned leaded gasoline additives, blood lead levels have fallen sharply since the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|No primary {{airports}} {{had been}} built in Helgeland by the mid-1960s. The coastal parts of the region, such as at Brønnøysund, were without highways and railways. Although Widerøe operated a seaplane route, it remained a summer-only service. Travel time to Sandnessjøen, where the closest hospital was located, took five hours. A committee, led by Erik Himle and later Preben Munthe, was appointed in 1962 to consider additional airports in Norway. The Sud Aviation Caravelle jet aircraft was about to <b>be</b> <b>phased</b> into use on the main domestic routes by Scandinavian Airlines System and the committee recommended in 1964 that nine new airports be built which could serve jetliners, including an airport in Sandnesssjøen.|$|E
5|$|On 26 April 1990, GM's New Zealand {{subsidiary}} Holden New Zealand {{announced that}} {{production at the}} assembly plant based in Trentham would <b>be</b> <b>phased</b> out and vehicles would be imported duty-free—this came after the 1984 closure of the Petone assembly line due to low output volumes. During the 1990s, Holden, other Australian automakers and trade unions pressured the Australian Government to halt the lowering of car import tariffs. By 1997, {{the federal government had}} already cut tariffs to 22.5percent, from 57.5percent ten years earlier; by 2000, a plan was formulated to reduce the tariffs to 15percent. Holden was critical, saying that Australia's population was not large enough, and that the changes could tarnish the local industry.|$|E

5|$|The Ministry of Transport and Communications {{announced}} in February1993 {{that they were}} considering taking over ownership and operations of the airport through the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA, later renamed Avinor). In December, Widerøe articulated that Båtsfjord Airport {{did not meet the}} demands for future operation as it lacked proper navigational aids and an asphalt runway. Widerøe stated that with the introduction of the Dash8, which would <b>be</b> <b>phased</b> in between 1993 and 1995, they would {{no longer be able to}} serve the airport. The CAA stated, instead, that the new airport should be built, estimated to cost between 70 and 80million Norwegian krone (NOK). The main reason was that the former airport was poorly located in relation to the terrain, being located in a valley. In April1994 the ministry stated that they were considering closing many of the smallest regional airports, including Båtsfjord.|$|E
5|$|The last Sabre {{conversion}} {{course was}} completed in December 1970. Early the following year, the Australian government announced that the Sabres were to <b>be</b> <b>phased</b> out and retired by July 1971. At this time RAAF fighter pilots were trained progressively on the CAC Winjeel, Macchi, Sabre and Mirage, but after considering the feasibility of direct Macchi-to-Mirage conversion, and the impracticability of maintaining the ageing Sabres, the government determined {{that it was possible}} to remove the Sabre from the process and retire the type, on the proviso that more Mirage trainers were made available; it subsequently approved the purchase of six new Mirage IIID dual trainers to augment the ten already in service. No.5 OTU was disbanded on 31July 1971, the date the Sabre was retired from RAAF service. The unit's Macchis were transferred back to No.2 OCU.|$|E
5|$|A {{legacy of}} the Manhattan Project was the network of {{national}} laboratories, but none was located on the East Coast. Rabi and Ramsey assembled a group of universities in the New York area to lobby for their own national laboratory. When Zacharias, who was now at MIT, heard about it, {{he set up a}} rival group at MIT and Harvard. Rabi had discussions with Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project, who was willing to go along with a new national laboratory, but only one. Moreover, while the Manhattan Project still had funds, the wartime organization was expected to <b>be</b> <b>phased</b> out when a new authority came into existence. After some bargaining and lobbying by Rabi and others, the two groups came together in January 1946. Eventually nine universities (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Rochester and Yale) came together, and on 31 January 1947 a contract was signed with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which had replaced the Manhattan Project, that established the Brookhaven National Laboratory.|$|E
