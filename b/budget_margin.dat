Multiple parcel-level carbon sequestration options are considered. Uncertainty has been a widely stated reason for not including soil carbon sequestration in the portfolio of greenhouse gases reduction measures.

30|$|Multi-carrier {{modulation}} (MCM) schemes {{are widely}} used for the short range optical transmission systems. The discrete multi-tone (DMT) with bit-loading technique can effectively approach the channel capacity. However, MCM schemes have the drawbacks of high peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) and computational complexity [9, 10]. Compared to the MCM schemes, single carrier modulation (SCM) schemes enjoy the advantages of computational simplicity and low PAPR. The Not-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) coding with equalization offers satisfactory achievable link power <b>budget</b> <b>margin</b> [8, 9]. The pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) is another SCM scheme that provides better spectrum efficiency than NRZ coding. As the short range optical transmission systems usually have high SNR, the PAM transmission scheme shows notable advantages over the classical NRZ transmission scheme [8, 11].|$|E

Inspired by the Cubesat standard, an affordable {{and easy to}} fabricate design will be introduced allowing universities to develop and perform own rover-based missions. As all major space agencies have set the goal to go to Earths natural satellite in the near future, several opportunities will arise to piggyback to the moon. With a maximum weight of 1 kg, one or multiple PicoBots, plus an eventually needed base station, could easily fill mass <b>budget</b> <b>margins.</b> By utilizing the alternating tripod gait, adapted from simple insects like the cockroach, locomotion can be realized with only two actuators. In comparison to most exploration rovers, the chosen propulsion system leads to a lower number in ‘degrees of freedom’ and therefore a much higher demand for a simple environment. Main advantage, on the other hand, is that it minimizes {{the complexity of the}} control-algorithm and reduces the mass as well as the cost. Thanks to the progress in the field of MEMS-based technologies, subsystem components and instruments are available in small sizes, are lightweight and with low power requirements. PicoBots could either be specifically designed for a single mechanical task, e. g. sampling and analysis of rocks, or numerous sensoric payloads, like the seismo- or gravimeter. Swarm intelligence and behavior could also be an interesting field of research. ...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{backhaul}} downlinks from high-altitude platforms (HAPs) are investigated. An experiment {{demonstrated the}} advantages of optical links: a small and lightweight terminal with low power consumption was launched to the stratosphere and data transmitted down to a ground station {{at a rate of}} 1. 25 Gbit/s: Owing to the chosen system parameters and the high <b>budget</b> <b>margin,</b> disturbing turbulence effects did not decrease the link performance. The scientific aspect of the experiment was to study turbulence effects in order to design future systems with higher transmission performance. On the day of the experiment, measured scintillation and wavefront distortions were minimal in the morning. The best atmospheric conditions were observed about 3 h after sunrise with a peak of the atmospheric coherence length r 0 at 16 cm. An r 0 of 4 cm was measured as the worst case before sunrise and later during the day. This trend could also be observed for power- and intensity scintillation index. The latter changed from 0. 28 (best case) to 1. 12. For small scintillation index a lognormal intensity probability density function was measured. Apart from the robust intensity modulation scheme with direct detection which was used for the trial, future improved systems could benefit from a coherent transmission scheme. According to the r 0 measurements and further simulations on heterodyne efficiency {{it turned out that the}} aperture size can be decreased from 40 to 10 cm without any significant change in the link margin. Future stratospheric optical links between HAPs or links from platforms to satellites will not suffer from cloud blockage but it remains an issue for up/downlinks to a ground station. This can be mitigated by ground-station diversity. Four optical ground stations in the southern part of Europe can lead to an availability of over 98...|$|E

This thesis reports the methods, the deployment strategies and the resulting system performance improvement of in-building environmental modification. With {{the increasing use of}} mobile computing devices such as PDAs, laptops, and the expansion of wireless local area networks (WLANs), there is growing interest in increasing productivity and efficiency through enhancing received signal power. This thesis proposes the deployment of waveguides consisting of frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) in indoor wireless environments and investigates their effect on radio wave propagation. The received power of the obstructed (OBS) path is attenuated significantly as compared with that of the line of sight (LOS) path, thereby requiring an additional link <b>budget</b> <b>margin</b> as well as increased battery power drain. In this thesis, the use of an innovative model is also presented to selectively enhance radio propagation in indoor areas under OBS conditions by reflecting the channel radio signals into areas of interest in order to avoid significant propagation loss. An FSS is a surface which exhibits reflection and/or transmission properties as a function of frequency. An FSS with a pass band frequency response was applied to an ordinary or modified wall as a wallpaper to transform the wall into a frequency selective (FS) wall (FS-WALL) or frequency selective modified wall (FS-MWALL). Measurements have shown that the innovative model prototype can enhance 2. 4 GHz (IEEE 802. 11 b/g/n) transmissions in addition to the unmodified wall, whereas other radio services, such as cellular telephony at 1. 8 GHz, have other routes to penetrate or escape. The FSS performance has been examined intensely by both equivalent circuit modelling, simulation, and practical measurements. Factors that influence FSS performance such as the FSS element dimensions, element conductivities, dielectric substrates adjacent to the FSS, and signal incident angles, were investigated. By keeping the elements small and densely packed, a largely angle-insensitive FSS was developed as a promising prototype for FSS wallpaper. Accordingly, the resultant can be modelled by cascading the effects of the FSS wallpaper and the ordinary wall (FSWALL) or modified wall (FS-MWALL). Good agreement between the modelled, simulated, and the measured results was observed. Finally, a small-scale indoor environment has been constructed and measured in a half-wave chamber and free space measurements in order to practically verify this approach and through the usage of the deterministic ray tracing technique.

This {{can be explained by the}} presence of strong multipath components which give rise to a low correlated Rayleigh Channel.

40|$|The {{design of}} a bandwidth-efficient {{physical}} layer for wireless access {{has always been a}} challenging task, because of the harsh environment, characterized by impairing phenomena such as radio interference, fading and shadowing. With circuit switching, a bit error rate suitable for real-time applications such as voice and video is guaranteed by adopting robust Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes and proper power <b>budget</b> <b>margins</b> to face fading problems. With this approach ARQ is used only for applications that require a much lower error rate, and can tolerate high delays. The introduction of the packet technique, allows the use ARQ even for real-time traffic. In this paper, we compare the efficiency of three error recovering techniques in presence of traffic with delay constraints, when the the memory property of the wireless segment is represented by the Gilbert-Elliot channel. The techniques compared are FEC with interleaving, real-time ARQ, and Erasure Coding (EC). The comparisons are performed by using both analytical and simulation tools. Two new analytical models are introduced to evaluate the performance of FEC and EC. Simulation is used to validate the analytical results and to derive the performance of real-time ARQ. The numerical results show that when the channel memory increases well beyond the packet transmission time the performance of FEC impairs due to the limited interleaving depth, while ARQ and EC remain effective...|$|R

In various sectors the rising price of oil and other commodities puts pressure on corporate <b>budgets,</b> <b>margins</b> and profits. Inflationary pressures and stalling growth compound the problems experienced by many businesses and complicate the situation for public policy makers searching for an appropriate response. While politicians consider their options many corporate boards face tough decisions. A balance has to be struck between the imperatives for current performance and future prospects (Coulson-Thomas, 2007 a). The dilemma for many corporate boards is reconciling the need for short term savings with the desire to build longer term capabilities. In periods of adversity it is often easier to distinguish between winners and losers. The winners or those most likely to succeed often behave very differently from the losers who often compound their problems and trap themselves in a descending spiral of decline. This paper looks at successful and unsuccessful responses to economic down turns and steps which boards can take to improve competitive positioning by containing costs, improving performance in key areas and enhancing corporate ability to compete and win.

The Katsinas, Lacey, and Hardy classification schema for community colleges is used to analyze data from the National Center for Education Statistics' Integrated Postsecondary Educational Data System (IPEDS) and Higher Education General Information Surveys (HEGIS). Further analysis clusters states into the following groupings: states with/without substantial local funding, large "mega-states" versus all other states (employing the methodology developed by Grapevine at Illinois State University), and the structure of state coordination (as developed by Tollefson and others in their studies of state community college systems). The analysis showed wide differences in the various funding patterns for community colleges as related to revenue streams. As late as 1980 - 91, 16 states contributed 60 % or more of the total budgets for their community colleges; by 2000 - 01, no state did so. By college type, rural-serving community colleges saw the greatest net negative change in their operating <b>budget</b> <b>margins,</b> from 3. 2 % to 0. 4 %, although {{it should be noted that}} every one of the community college types also experienced a significant decline in this margin.

I postulate that many future optical LANs {{will be required to}} operate with limited optical power budgets for a variety of reasons, including increased system complexity and link speed, low cost components and minimal increases in transmit power. Some developers will wish to run links with reduced power <b>budget</b> <b>margins,</b> and the received data in these systems will be more susceptible to errors than has been the case previously. The errors observed in optical systems are investigated using the particular case of Gigabit Ethernet on fibre as an example. Gigabit Ethernet is one of three popular optical local area interconnects which use 8 B/ 10 B line coding, along with Fibre Channel and Infiniband, and is widely deployed. This line encoding is also used by packet switched optical LANs currently under development. A probabilistic analysis follows the effects of a single channel error in a frame, through the line coding scheme and the MAC layer frame error detection mechanisms. Empirical data is used to enhance this original analysis, making it directly relevant to deployed systems. Experiments using Gigabit Ethernet on fibre with reduced power levels at the receiver to simulate the effect of limited power margins are described. It is found that channel bit error rate and packet loss rate have only a weakly deterministic relationship, due to interactions between a number of non-uniform error characteristics at various network sub-layers. Some data payloads suffer from high bit error rates and low packet loss rates, compared to others with lower bit error rates and yet higher packet losses. Experiments using real Internet traffic {{contribute to the development of}} a novel model linking packet loss, the payload damage rate, and channel bit error rate. The observed error behaviours at various points in the physical and data link layers are detailed. These include data-dependent channel errors; this error hot- spotting is in contrast to the failure modes observed in a copper-based system. It is also found that both multiple channel errors within a single code-group, and multiple error instances within a frame, occur more frequently than might be expected. The overall effects of these error characteristics on the ability of cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs) to detect errors, and on the performance of higher layers in the network, is considered. This dissertation contributes to the discussion of layer interactions, which may lead to un-foreseen performance issues at higher levels of the network stack, and extends it by considering the physical and data link layers for a common form of optical link. The increased risk of errors in future optical networks, and my findings for 8 B/ 10 B encoded optical links, demonstrate the need for a cross-layer understanding of error characteristics in such systems. The development of these new networks should take error performance into account in light of the particular requirements of the application in question.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of historical NASA Programs (Apollo, Shuttle and International Space Station), {{have been based on}} pre-agreed missions which included specific pre-defined destinations (e. g., the Moon and low Earth orbit). Due to more constrained budget profiles, and the desire to have a more flexible architecture for Mission capture as it is affordable, NASA is working toward a set of Programs that are capability based, rather than mission and/or destination specific. This means designing for a performance capability that can be applied to a specific human exploration mission/destination later (sometime years later). This approach does support developing systems to flatter budgets over time, however, it also poses the challenge of how to accomplish this effectively while maintaining a trained workforce, extensive manufacturing, test and launch facilities, and ensuring mission success ranging from Low Earth Orbit to asteroid destinations. NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in support of Exploration Systems Directorate (ESD) in Washington, DC has been developing approaches to track affordability across multiple Programs. The first step is to ensure a common definition of affordability: the discipline to bear cost in meeting a <b>budget</b> with <b>margin</b> {{over the life of the}} program. The second step is to infuse responsibility and accountability for affordability into all levels of the implementing organization since affordability is no single person s job; it is everyone s job. The third step is to use existing data to identify common affordability elements organized by configuration (vehicle/facility), cost, schedule, and risk. The fourth step is to analyze and trend this affordability data using an affordability dashboard to provide status, measures, and trends for ESD and Program level of affordability tracking.

Managing and realizing these networks, not only within time, <b>budget,</b> safety <b>margins</b> and quality standards, but also {{with a minimum of}} public inconvenience during construction, are key success factors. In this respect subsoil conditions imply great risks and therefore are of major importance. For these reasons Rijkswaterstaat initiated the Dutch Geo-Impuls program for reducing geotechnical failure. This joint industry programme aims to strengthen the geotechnical community by substantially reducing geotechnical failures in all types of construction projects. It started in 2009 and was completed in 2015. All of the more than 40 Geo-Impuls participants embraced Geotechnical Risk Management (GeoRM) as the preferred geotechnical working method. Parallel to, and in close cooperation with, the evolvements within the Geo-Impuls program, Rijkswaterstaat developed its own processes and practices, keeping Geotechnical Risk Management (GeoRM) and its associated GeoPrinciples in mind. Our paper for the ISGSR 2013 addressed the implementation of GeoRM working methods in the organization. This paper aims to provide an overview of the unique set of GeoRM tooling that has been developed within RWS.

40|$|The {{economic}} impact of different extension messages used was calculated using enterprise <b>budgeting</b> (gross <b>margin</b> analysis). Input data were gleaned from the literature, from participatory appraisals, {{as well as a}} field study, spanning 12 months, of small-scalecommunal goat farming systems in Jericho in the Odi District of NorthWest Province. The number of offspring weaned per annum, as a proportion of does owned, was selected as the desired output for analysis. This study has shown that small-scale communal goat farmers are not adopting or implementing extension messages to improve production capacity. In south Africa the majority of goats are slaughtered in the informal sector. If the informal sector is to be persuaded to market goats commercially through formal channels, then knowledge of the economics of goat farming on communal lands should be provided. The economic aspects of extension messages are probably an important factor in determining acceptance and sustainability yet appear to be seldom investigated. The probable reason for lack of adoption of standard extension messages, which promote improved nutrition, parasite control, vaccination and treatment of goats, was economic. In other words, the so-called 'poor management practices' used by communal farmers appeared to be economically more profitable than the 'good management practices' suggested to increase production. The price of communal goats was not related to their mass. A higher level of inputs would probably have resulted in a heavier kid, however it was established that this would not have influenced the price received as a majority of the goats were slaughtered for ritual purposes where age, colour and sex were more important to the purchaser than body mass. It is standard practice in commercial farming systems to evaluate the economic benefits of all management practices before they are implemented. Production animal veterinarians use veterinary economics to compare different scenarios to control diseases or select management practices in commercial herds. It is suggested that the inputs and outputs of small-scale farming systems should be carefully analysed and that veterinary economics should also be used to evaluate the probable impact of extension messages formulated by veterinarians and animal health technicians...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{assess the impact}} of {{unexpected}} shocks to real interest rates and GDP on government budgets for nine European Union countries. Shocks are estimated as onestep-ahead forecast errors arising from a recursive bivariate VAR model. To assess the impact on the budgets we use available information on budgetary sensitivities with respect to the business cycle and estimate the sensitivities to changes in interest rates {{on the basis of the}} maturity structure of public debts. Our analysis is relevant, in particular, to define what safety margins are needed to avoid the deficit exceeding the 3 per cent Maastricht threshold. The approach followed in this paper differs in two respects from standard analyses aiming at defining budgetary positions that satisfy the Stability and Growth Pact. First, whereas the latter examine only fluctuations in economic activity, we also consider fluctuations in interest rates. Second, whereas standard analyses focus on deviations from trends and define margins for the medium-term cyclically adjusted balance, we examine unexpected shocks and define margins for nominal balances. The results point to significant differences in the required margins across countries, depending on the amplitude of past shocks, the magnitude of automatic stabilizers and the size and maturity structure of the debt. In the case of Italy, the country with the highest debt/GDP ratio and the largest fraction of short-term debt, the impact of unexpected shocks to interest rates may be quite substantial. However, when shocks to interest rates and GDP are considered jointly, other countries (Belgium and Finland) seem to require larger <b>margins.</b> <b>budgeting,</b> Stability and Growth Pact, forecast errors...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe post-rift siliciclastic {{sediment}} <b>budget</b> {{of passive}} <b>margins</b> {{is a function}} of (1) the deformation (uplift) of theupstream catchment, of (2) the climate (precipitation) regime and of (3) the oceanic circulation (mainly sinceMiocene times). The main questions in source to sink studies are (1) to quantify the relative importance of theerosion due to uplifts or to precipitation changes and (2) to characterize the source of the sediments. A source to sink study was carried out in Western, Central and Austral Africa, characterized by anorogenic relief(plains and plateaus) that record long (several 100 km) to very long (several 1000 km) wavelength deformationsrespectively of lithospheric and mantle origin. The sink measurement was based on seismic lines and wells (industrial – IODP) using the VolumeEstimatorsoftware including the calculation of the uncertainties (Guillocheau et al., 2013, Basin Research). The source studywas performed using dated stepped planation surfaces (etchplains and pediplains), mappable at catchments-scale(Guillocheau et al., in press, Gondwana Research). Results: (1) Deformation (uplift) is the dominant control of the sediment budget. Climate (precipitation) changesonly enhance or inhibit a deformation-controlled flux. (2) The sources of siliciclastic sediments are either closedmarginal bulges or far field domes due to mantle dynamics with river by-passing over long-lasting polygenicsurfaces located between the bulges and domes. Two main periods of African-scale deformations (contemporaneous with an increase of the sedimentary flux) are confirmed, one during Late Cretaceous (Turonian-Coniacian) and the second around the Eocene-Oligoceneboundary with a gap and intense chemical erosion from 75 Ma and mainly from 65 to 40 Ma...|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{dispersal}} at {{the river}} mouths {{has been an important}} topic in the fields of geomorphology and hydraulics {{for a long time and}} estimating sediment budget of the deltas is a principal method for quantifying the sediment dispersal system at many river mouths. Many reports about sediment dispersal at the Yellow River mouth have been given previously using this method. However, since the dry bulk density of deposits in the delta and the boundaries set for calculating the volumes of deposits did not receive a proper treatment, big discrepancy existed between estimates of sediment budgets of the delta provided by the previous studies. Considering the effects of grain size composition, burial depth, and exposure conditions on the dry bulk density of deposits and based on abundant data about the dry bulk density of deposits in the delta, this study defined the dry bulk densities for the deposits in the delta plain and buried delta front deposits, buried prodelta, exposed subaqueous prodelta, and newly deposited top 1 m layers on the delta front. Combining the constructed models of dry bulk density for different depositional settings with the results of analyzing the sedimentary framework of the delta, sediment budgets at Diaokouhe lobe of the Yellow River delta were calculated. The foot of the delta front slope was set as the outer margin of area for defining the sediment <b>budgets.</b> This <b>margin</b> is of geomorphologic significance and is easy to be located on the surface of delta recorded by the bathymetric data. Results show that sediment deposited in the delta plain and front of the Diaokouhe lobe over the period from 1965 to 1974 was about 7. 10 × 10 9 tons, accounting for 73. 5 % of the incoming sediment. Errors resulting from ignoring clay layers in the deposits on delta plain and front, consolidation of soft layers underlying delta deposits, and deviations in records of the incoming sediment were proved to be about 2. 6 % for the percentage of sediment deposited in the delta, suggesting the higher reliability of the sediment budgets given by this study. From the mass and volume of sediments deposited in the Diaokouhe lobe over the period of 1965 - 1974, a mean dry bulk density of 1. 36 g/cm 3 was acquired. On account of the dominance of silt in the deposits of the delta, it seems to be an appropriate approximation of the mean dry bulk density for the deposits in the other lobes of the delta. 以往在黃河三角洲沉積量的估算中,對沉積物干容重和計算邊界等問題不夠重視,導致計算結果存在明顯出入。本項研究通過廣泛收集資料和大量采樣分析得到了多種沉積環境下沉積物干容重的計算模型,結合三角洲沉積結構分析和利用地形測量數據,計算了黃河口釣口河流路時期亞三角洲不同時期的沉積量。其中 196 5 年至 1974 年間釣口河亞三角洲前緣坡腳以內的總淤積量為 71. 0 億t。其平均干容重為 1. 36 g/cm 3 。這一干容重用于估算其它亞三角洲沉積量不會造成明顯誤差。認為忽略三角洲下松軟沉積層的壓實沉降、三角洲平原相和前緣相中粘性土與非粘性土干容重的差別以及來沙量的測量誤差對計算結果影響較小...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe terrigeneous {{sediment}} <b>budget</b> {{of passive}} <b>margin</b> basins records variations in continental relief triggered by either deformation or climate. Consequently, {{it becomes a}} major challenge to determine sediment accumulation histories in {{a large number of}} basins found in various geodynamic contexts. In this study, we developed a GIS-based method to determine the sediment budget at the scale of a whole basin (from the upstream continental onlap to the most distal deepest marine deposits) and the associated uncertainties. The volume of sediments preserved in the basin for each time interval was estimated by interpolation between cross-sections and then corrected from in situ production and porosity to obtain terrigeneous solid volumes. This approach was validated by applying it to Namibia-South African passive margin basins for which independent data are available. We determined by a statistical approach the variances associated with each parameter of the method: the geometrical extrapolation of the section (8 - 43 %), the uncertainties on seismic velocities for the depth conversion (2 - 10 %), on the absolute ages of stratigraphic horizons (0. 2 - 12 %), on the carbonate content (0. 2 - 46 %) and on remaining porosities estimation (3 - 5 %). Our estimates of the accumulated volumes were validated by comparison with previous estimates at a lower temporal resolution in the same area. We discussed variations in accumulation rates observed in terms of relief variations triggered by climate and/or deformation. The high accumulation rates determined for the Lower Cretaceous, progressively decreasing to a minimum in the Mid-Cretaceous, are consistent with the progressive relaxation of a rift-related relief. The following increase to an Upper Cretaceous maximum is consistent with a major relief reorganization driven either by an uplift and/or a change to more humid climate conditions. The lower accumulation rate in the Cenozoic suggests a relief reorganization of lesser amplitude over that period...|$|R
40|$|Choosing {{the optimal}} {{cropping}} or enterprise mix has undoubtedly {{been one of}} the greatest challenges facing farmers due to multiple objectives such as food security, cash requirements, profit maximization etc. Farmers find it difficult to choose an optimal cropping or enterprise mix given the multiple objectives faced by farmers and often continuous changing farming systems and profitability. As a result, decision making has become more and more difficult in agriculture requiring sophisticated techniques and methods to help in decision making. Several methods have been used in empirical studies to help farmers in decision making especially on optimal crop mix. This critical decision is made by each farmer {{at the beginning of each}} season. Maximizing profits leads to the same decision rule as minimizing costs of production. The production theory defines output or production as a function of several inputs such as land, labor, capital and management. These factors influence production and household resource allocation. There are several research methods that have been identified in the literature. The methods reviewed vary from gross margin to linear programming models. Linear programming might be preferred where the choice was made among many alternatives and high accuracy needed because it enables even a less skilled worker to reach optimum solution. Chapter 3 presented the research methods which were going to be used to achieve my objectives. Introduction of a new enterprise affected resource allocation as farmers re-organized resource use to accommodate new enterprise and increase income. The analytical framework consisted of gross margin and linear programming analysis. The main objective of this study was to estimate the optimal cropping or enterprise mix that would result with the introduction of organic chili production in the districts of Goromonzi and Marondera, in Mashonaland-East province in Zimbabwe. Preliminary analysis showed chili, ground nuts, and sugar beans and maize with about US 380, US 349, US 180 and US 53 gross <b>margin</b> <b>budgets</b> respectively. Although preliminary analysis was necessary to understand the socio-economic characteristics of the two districts, and have these socio-economic characteristics would affect agricultural output given the level of function of production and given level of technology. Further detailed analysis was required to understand the optimal cropping enterprise mix in the two districts. Linear programming estimation was therefore carried out to estimate the optimal crop mix for an average farmer in the two districts. Linear programming analysis was used to explore optimum crop mix for the average farmer. The optimum crop mix is 0. 2 acres, 0. 3 acres, 5. 5 acres and 0 acres of ground nuts, sugar beans, chili and maize respectively. The optimal crop gross return is US 3082. Finally, sensitivity analysis was carried out. It showed that a percentage increase in land resulted in increase in area under. Areas under the other crops remained the same. Further sensitivity analysis showed that a percentage change in labor resulted in a decrease in the gross return. However there were no factor movements both at 5...|$|R
40|$|Coconut is {{the most}} widely grown {{plantation}} crop in Sri Lanka. Smallholders own more than 80 percent of the area under coconut production. For various reasons, coconut groves are often neglected and produce little income compared with other commercial crops such as tea, rubber, cocoa and pepper. It is widely recognized that productivity of such coconut lands can be improved by integrating other activities such as pasture, and cattle, cocoa, pineapple into the coconut stand. Eighty-five percent of the coconut groves in Sri Lanka are in the highly populated Wet Zone of the country, where the cultivable lands are scarce and there is high unemployment and under employment especially among the agricultural labour force. The necessity of further development of this sector has long been recognized, and attempts are continually being made to increase the utilization of these coconut lands in various ways. However, the success {{is far from the}} expectations. This project is an attempt to provide a tool to help accelerate the process of evaluating and adopting changes to help increase the productivity of coconut plantations. The objective of the study is to provide an analytical framework for extension agents to use for analysing the relative profitability of alternative intercropping activities. As well, to provide a decision aid to help decision making about coconut-based cropping systems, or similar systems, with small modification of the skeleton budget models used here. The budgets will be able to be used by extension workers as an aid to assess the scope for farmers to improve the productivity, and then used to help to motivate farmers to adopt appropriate extra activities on their farms. These skeleton budget models may also be useful to researchers to help identify research needs and for bankers to help them understand the financial aspects of different activities. After reviewing the literature, skeleton models have been developed to analyze the economic worth and financial feasibility of integrating improved pasture and cattle, and intercropping cocoa, with coconut production, based on a case study farm relevant to Sri Lanka. A physical plan including labour requirement tables, gross <b>margin</b> <b>budgets,</b> partial budgets, cash flow development budgets and whole farm budgets have been built on the computer spreadsheet for each of the alternative activities under consideration. Sensitivity analysis is done to verify and demonstrate the usefulness of using `what it' scenarios to help the appraisal of the risks involved. When analysing the case study farm using the tools developed, it has been found that each tool has a distinct role. For example, the whole farm budget developed for the present farm plan is needed as a base to compare profitability after changes. As well, it is useful to identify shortcomings of the present way of farming. It is also found that different budgets can be used at different stages in the process of analysing the case and making a decision to adopt the most suitable alternative. Models such as these also can used to analyze more complex mixed farms, with relatively small modification. Skeleton models like those developed in this study can be used in other farming systems. Such models, and sensitivity analyses, can be used by researchers to identify problems and design further research work. Also these models can help non-agricultural personnel such as bankers and policy makers, to understand the worth of agricultural projects. Such knowledge can be used to change policies which are aimed at giving benefits to farmers. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R
40|$|This {{collection}} of papers explores the emergence of, implications for, and justice issues surrounding a new tradition of pastoralism in central Kenya: conservation-driven privatization and commercialization of traditional knowledge and environmental labor. It draws on fieldwork completed for my master’s thesis during May to August 2010 among pastoralists in Laikipia, Kenya, at the Mpala Ranch and Research Centre {{and the nearby}} Maasai communities of Ilmotiok and Tiemamut. Through semi-structured interviews and household surveys, I found that conservation and development agendas in this region are contributing to {{a new wave of}} livelihood shifts for local pastoralists in which individuals are transitioning from being animal owners to animal ‘caretakers’ employed by powerful conservation groups. At large, my thesis focuses on the social outcomes of these livelihood shifts, including shifts in the sharing of traditional knowledge, decision-making strategies, and associated environmental justice complexities of a new kind of labor-based rather than landscape-based mobility. Using interdisciplinary means and different focal points, these papers explore that theme closely, including issues surrounding resource dependency, insider/outsider knowledge and resource control, shifts in economic norms on individual and landscape scales, and associated questions of cultural transition and justice. The overarching research question in these discussions is what are the tradeoffs of various outcomes of contemporary coupled pastoral management and conservation strategies in an integrated natural-human system? More specifically, what carries over from traditional herding patterns and processes, and what is gained and/or lost when there are attempts by conservation efforts to transform this system? For example, to what extent have conservation strategies such as the Mpala model done away with the socio-spatial mobility and use of ecological heterogeneity by implementing fixed boundaries on the landscape, or have they instead increased flexibility by altering the natural landscape (i. e. through infrastructural development) ? The introduction in this series serves as a broad introduction to this landscape, its ecology and its society, its history and its present challenges, as well as a more focused introduction to framing my study sites for further discussion. Beyond this introduction, the three following papers attempt to capture the holistic “identity” of this complex multi-part, multi-person, multilandscape, multi-national endeavor. My intent is to capture the experiential identity of all of these efforts as one that is not static, drawing from oral histories, present experiences, and theory in relevant literature to understand the institutional and cross-continental complexities of conservation and development attempts in this landscape. Part one then focuses on shifting norms of perceptions of land use and land use change in these landscapes. I rely on information represented in my surveys of pastoralists at Mpala and in the surrounding community group ranches. I explore tolerance of wildlife by pastoralists at Mpala and their associated challenges versus tolerance of wildlife by pastoralists in the group ranches and their challenges; such tolerance levels lend information to a transition of knowledge, information output, and communication networks in both landscapes that I compare and contrast across two communities in the same landscape. 5 Part two discusses the privatization and commercialization of traditional knowledge and environmental labor, and I hypothesize on the ecological consequences and social outcomes of this privatization. I draw from the literature in other African pastoral contexts where similar questions are being asked, i. e. of the Maasina in Mali, the FulBe in Côte d’Ivoire, and the Fulani in other West African nations. Within the realm of political ecology and institutional analyses, I write about the shift from animal ownership to animal caretaking and the implications for institutions that are changing norms of mobility in these ecosystems. This paper relies heavily on my ethnographic fieldnotes and informal interviews from key informants, as well as a literature review of the privatization of knowledge and pastoralism. Finally, part three explores the theme of technology and transition in this landscape closely, namely with regard to the changes brought to the experience of pastoralism with the influx of technology. The comparatively large <b>budget</b> and profit <b>margin</b> of Mpala and similar ranches in the region allow for the use of technology {{in a way that is}} not seen in other parcels of Laikipia. Here, pastoralists use cell phones to aid in daily and seasonal decision-making but have difficulty finding infrastructure for charging those phones; some use vehicles for transportation or moving injured livestock; radios give warning of dangerous wildlife nearby; and expensive, easily transportable metal fences are used to rotate cattle pastures more frequently than in nearby Maasai group ranches to try to control environmental degradation. Major themes considered include the relationship of technological resources to sustainability, knowledge and resource control, shifts in financial agendas, and transitions in traditional knowledge networks. Collectively, these papers attempt to offer at once snapshots of a landscape complex in its history, present use, and future potential; as well as a holistic overview of a natural-human system in transition, one that is increasingly being recognized for its importance as a leader to conservation in East Africa. In the following analyses I suggest that despite this recognition in the conservation world, there are in fact many more questions to be answered, more social concerns needing to be addressed, and more knowledge to be gleaned before this system is used as a model for conservation, pastoralism, or development in this landscape or elsewhere in Africa...|$|R
