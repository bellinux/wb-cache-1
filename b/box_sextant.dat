50|$|William Jones (1763-1831) was an English {{maker of}} optical and other {{scientific}} instruments, who had Thomas Jefferson among his customers in London. He later formed {{a partnership with}} his younger brother Samuel Jones. W. & S. Jones {{were among the most}} successful scientific instrument makers in London during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. In 1797,Jones introduced the <b>box</b> <b>sextant</b> or 'pocket sextant' for nautical navigation, an early marvel of mechanical miniaturisation.|$|E
60|$|I carried {{myself a}} small barometer, a large knife and digger for plants, note-book, telescope, compass, and other instruments; whilst {{two or three}} Lepcha lads who {{accompanied}} me as satellites, carried a botanising <b>box,</b> thermometers, <b>sextant</b> and artificial horizon, measuring-tape, azimuth compass and stand, geological hammer, bottles and boxes for insects, sketch-book, etc., arranged in compartments of strong canvass bags. The Nepal officer (of the rank of serjeant, I believe) always kept near me {{with one of his}} men, rendering innumerable little services. Other sepoys were distributed amongst the remainder of the party; one went ahead to prepare camping-ground, and one brought up the rear.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{singular}} sight which met {{his eyes as}} he entered the sitting-room of the Admiral. A great sea chest stood open in the center, and all round upon the carpet were little piles of jerseys, oil-skins, books, <b>sextant</b> <b>boxes,</b> instruments, and sea-boots. The old seaman sat gravely amidst this lumber, turning it over, and examining it intently; while his wife, with the tears running silently down her ruddy cheeks, sat upon the sofa, her elbows upon her knees and her chin upon her hands, rocking herself slowly backwards and forwards.|$|R
2500|$|In {{her last}} message {{received}} at Howland Island, Earhart {{reported that they}} were flying a standard position line (or sun line), a routine procedure for an experienced navigator like Noonan. This line passed within sight of Gardner Island (now called Nikumaroro) in the Phoenix Island Group to the southeast, and there is a range of documented, archaeological, and anecdotal evidence supporting the hypothesis that Earhart and Noonan found Gardner Island, uninhabited at the time, landed the Electra on a flat reef near the wreck of a freighter, and sent sporadic radio messages from there. It has been surmised that Earhart and Noonan might have survived on Nikumaroro for several weeks before dying as castaways. In 1940, Gerald Gallagher, a British colonial officer and a licensed pilot, radioed his superiors to tell them that he believed he had found Earhart's skeleton, along with a <b>sextant</b> <b>box,</b> under a tree on the island's southeast corner. In a 1998 report to the American Anthropological Association, researchers, including a forensic anthropologist and an archaeologist, concluded, [...] "What we can be certain of is that bones were found on the island in 1939–40, associated with what were observed to be women’s shoes and a navigator’s <b>sextant</b> <b>box,</b> and that the morphology of the recovered bones, insofar as we can tell by applying contemporary forensic methods to measurements taken at the time, appears consistent with a female of Earhart’s height and ethnic origin.|$|R
5000|$|The Smithsonian Institution houses four navigational {{instruments}} {{manufactured by}} Spencer, Browning & Rust in its National Museum of American History. The items include two sextants, an octant, and a telescope. American Arctic explorer Charles Francis Hall (1821-1871) owned {{one of the}} sextants. It is believed that this brass sextant was most probably with him on 30 August 1871. On that day, Hall (pictured) {{had arrived at the}} furthest northern point achieved by an explorer to date. The <b>box</b> containing the <b>sextant</b> has several inscriptions: [...] "Captain Halls Quadrant - To be given to his family" [...] and [...] "To the Honorable George M. Robeson, U.S. N., Secretary to the Navy" [...] and [...] "from William Reid." [...] This sextant and a second in the collection are both inscribed: [...] "Spencer Browning & Rust London." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I found, too, {{in one of}} Mr. Codrington's <b>boxes,</b> a small <b>sextant</b> for me, which, being {{packed with}} the Thomas a Kempis, I think may have been your brother's. Do you really mean this for me too? If so, I shall value it {{scarcely}} less than the book. Indeed, I think that, divided as I am from all relations and home influences and affections, I cling all the more to such means as I may still enjoy of keeping up associations. I like to have my father's watch-chain in use, and to write on his old desk. I remember my inkstand in our drawing-room in London. So I value much these memorials of the first Missionary Bishop of the Church of England, in modern days at all events, and night by night as I read a few lines in his book, and think of him, it brings me, I hope, nearer in spirit to him and to others, who, like him, have done their duty well and now rest in Christ.|$|R
50|$|Nikumaroro, Manra and Orona were {{evacuated}} by the British government in 1963. At his mother's request Gallagher's remains {{were moved to}} Tarawa for reburial and the memorial plaque was retrieved. Although reasons cited for giving up on the struggling colony included unstable water lenses and uncertain copra markets, observers familiar with the colony's history remarked that after Gallagher's death a will or nerve to succeed seemed to vanish from the settlements. In 2001 an American archaeological team put {{a replica of the}} plaque on his grave, quite unaware it had been empty for 38 years. They were on the island because {{during the height of the}} Battle of Britain in October 1940 Gallagher, a licensed pilot, had radioed his superiors in Fiji to inform them he believed a work party of Gilbertese colonists on Nikumaroro had found a <b>sextant</b> <b>box</b> along with the skeletal remains possibly belonging to Amelia Earhart, an aviator who disappeared in 1937. In 2007 Gallagher's long-empty 1941 grave was still visible in the overgrown ruins of the government station on Nikumaroro.|$|R
2500|$|In December 1938, laborers {{landed on}} the island and started {{constructing}} the settlement. Around April 1940, a skull was discovered and buried, but British colonial officer Gerald Gallagher did not learn of it until September 1940. In September 1940, Gallagher, a licensed pilot, instituted a search and then radioed his superiors that he had found a [...] "skeleton ... possibly that of a woman", along with an old-fashioned <b>sextant</b> <b>box,</b> under a tree on the island's southeast corner. He was ordered to send the remains to Fiji. Gallagher believed there was a small chance that the skeleton was Earhart's. In 1941, British colonial authorities took detailed measurements of the bones and concluded they were from a male about 5ft 5 in tall (165cm). These bones were misplaced in Fiji long ago, so they cannot be reexamined. In 1998, an analysis of the measurement data by forensic anthropologists did not confirm the original findings, concluding instead that the skeleton had belonged to a [...] "tall white female of northern European ancestry". A critical review of both analyses was conducted in 2015, concluding that [...] "the most robust scientific analysis and conclusions are those of the original British finding indicating that the Nikumaroro bones belonged to a robust, middle-aged man, not Amelia Earhart." ...|$|R
