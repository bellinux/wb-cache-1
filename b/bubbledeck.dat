40|$|This {{paper is}} compilated as a masters degree {{assignment}} at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, University of Oslo. Today, Bubble Deck {{is used to}} reduce the net weight of a concrete slab. This is done by casting plastic pellets for an optimalized cross-section of the slab. It is desirable to reduce the net weight, to increase the load capasity for maximum loads, or to increase span between the loadbearing structures for the slab. <b>BubbleDeck</b> is mostly used in industrial buildings where the need for large, open spaces {{are a part of}} the design criterias. This paper looks at how <b>BubbleDeck</b> behaves at consentratet maximum loads. The thesis is solved by looking at the shell theory, to work out an equation that describes the membrane-forces in the cross section over the plastic pellet in <b>BubbleDeck,</b> under a variable concentrated load. The results are compared with an element analasys in Robot. The shell is simplified to describe the concrete above the slab with a constant thickness. The analasys shows increased bending stress at reduced load surface. To take a closer look at the tensions at the top of the slab, two new models are established, one shell with varied thickness in Robot and one model with volume-elements in Patran (SESAM program package). The results of these models show that longitudinal tension occurs in the concrete towards the plastic pellets. Cracks appear to be evident by obtained dimensional tensile strength for the concrete. The tensile strengths are also estimated for different placement of load above the plastic pellet, and for varying load surface. During testing, this assumption proved to be very conservative. In addition, the crack came as a clean shear fracture around the load surface. This states, that even for small loads, it would be relevant to consider shear fracture of the slab, both locally over the plastic pellet and globally for the slab...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural EngineeringKimberly Waggle KramerReinforced {{concrete}} slabs {{are one of}} the most common components in modern building construction. Reinforced {{concrete slabs}} with plastic voids slabs are a new and innovative type of structural, concrete slab system developed to allow for lighter self-weight of the structure while maintaining similar load carrying capacity of a solid slab. Plastic voided slabs are capable of reducing the amount of concrete necessary to construct a building by 30 percent or more. This reduction can be beneficial in terms of financial savings as well as building performance. This report examines a two-way, reinforced concrete slab with plastic voids construction in comparison to traditional flat plate reinforced concrete slab construction. The design process for plastic voided slabs is directly compared with traditional two-way flat plate reinforced concrete slabs through a design comparison of typical bays of 20 ’ by 20 ’ (6 m by 6 m), 25 ’ by 25 ’ (7. 6 m by 7. 6 m), 30 ’ by 30 ’ (9 m by 9 m) and 35 ’ by 35 ’ (10. 7 m by 10. 7 m). The traditional slab design process follows the ACI 318 - 11 Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete chapter 13 Direct Design Method, while the plastic voided slab design process is modified from the <b>BubbleDeck</b> Design Guide for compliance with BCA using AS 3600 and EC 2. Sizes of traditional slab bays are compared to sizes of plastic voided slab bays. Results of the comparison study are presented...|$|E
