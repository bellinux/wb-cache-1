25|$|After molting, {{the female}} lays a single batch of eggs either within the {{existing}} gallery, or will find new territory {{to start a}} new colony. Here, the eggs hatch into nymphs that resemble small, wingless adults (images right and below). After a short period of parental care, the nymphs undergo hemimetabolosis (moulting into several instars before emerging as a fully grown adult after the last moult), molting a total of four times before reaching adult form. Adult males never eat, and leave the home colony almost immediately to find a female and mate. Those males that can not fly will often mate with females in nearby colonies, meaning their chosen mates are often siblings or closely related. In some species, the female will eat the male after mating, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>event,</b> the male will not survive for long after mating. A few species are known to be parthenogenetic, meaning they are able to produce viable offspring without fertilisation of eggs. This phemonenon occurs when a female is, for whatever reason, unable to find a male to mate with, thus giving her and her species reproductive security at all times.|$|E

This article considers the scheme of the 2002 Act and conducts a survey of the domestic adoption case-law under it in the light of some of the requirements of the UNCRC, with particular reference to the implications of the Act for the child's relationship with his or her birth family.

40|$|Some {{cells have}} a quality control {{checkpoint}} that can detect a single misattached chromosome and delay {{the onset of}} anaphase, thus allowing time for error correction. The mechanical error in attachment must somehow {{be linked to the}} chemical regulation of cell cycle progression. The 3 F 3 antibody detects phosphorylated kinetochore proteins that might serve as the required link (Gorbsky, G. J., and W. A. Ricketts. 1993. J. Cell Biol. 122 : 1311 - 1321). We show by direct micromanipulation experiments that tension alters the phosphorylation of kinetochore proteins. Tension, whether from a micromanipulation needle or from normal mitotic forces, causes dephosphorylation of the kinetochore proteins recognized by 3 F 3. If tension is absent, either naturally or as a result of chromosome detachment by micromanipulation, the proteins are phosphorylated. Equally direct experiments identify tension as the checkpoint signal: tension from a microneedle on a misattached chromosome leads to anaphase (Li, X., and R. B. Nicklas. 1995. Nature (Lond.). 373 : 630 - 632), and we show here that the absence of tension caused by detaching chromosomes from the spindle delays anaphase indefinitely. Thus, the absence of tension is linked to both kinetochore phosphorylation and delayed anaphase onset. We propose that the kinetochore protein dephosphorylation caused by tension is the all clear signal to the checkpoint. The evidence is circumstantial <b>but</b> rich. <b>In</b> <b>any</b> <b>event,</b> tension alters kinetochore chemistry. Very likely, tension affects chemistry directly, by altering the conformation of a tension-sensitive protein, which leads directly to dephosphorylation...|$|R
5000|$|One such {{mechanism}} is the {{limit on the}} number of candidates in proportion to the number of seats available. At the national level, for example, a maximum of 110 candidates are allowed per 100 seats; at the provincial level, this ratio is 120 candidates per 100 seats. This ratio increases for each lower level of people's congresses, until the lowest level, the village level, has no limit {{on the number of}} candidates for each seat. However, the Congress website says [...] "In an indirect election, the number of candidates should exceed the number to be elected by 20% to 50%." [...] The practice of having more candidates than seats for NPC delegate positions has become standard, and it is different from Soviet practice in which all delegates positions were selected by the Party center. Although the limits on member selection allows the Party leadership to block unacceptable candidates, it also causes unpopular candidates to be removed in the electoral process.Direct and explicit challenges to the rule of the Communist Party are not tolerated, <b>but</b> are unlikely <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>event</b> due to the control the party center has on delegate selection.|$|R
50|$|The {{holding of}} a public auction will also usually be {{regarded}} as an invitation to treat. Auctions are, however, a special case generally.

If an auction is without reserve then, whilst there is no contract of sale between the owner of the goods and the highest bidder (because the placing of goods in the auction is an invitation to treat), there is a collateral contract between the auctioneer and the highest bidder that the auction will be held without reserve (i.e., that the highest bid, however low, will be accepted). The U.S. Uniform Commercial Code provides that in an auction without reserve the goods may not be withdrawn once they have been put up.|$|R

40|$|Underlying most {{debates of}} racial {{inequality}} is the tacit {{reference to the}} Immigrant Tale, a story of “natural” class ascension of immigrant groups in the “land of opportunity. ” This tale is affirming, celebrating the assimilation of ethnic immigrants in the American “melting pot. ” It is also optimistic, implying social integration and economic parity of currently dissipated immigrant communities. “Its thrust is to defend the individualistic view of the American system because it portrays the system as open {{to those who are}} willing to work hard and pull themselves over barriers of poverty and discrimination. ” But there is an unsavory element of the immigrant tale: its use as a sword in the battle against the civil rights era quest to promote racial equality through law. In its most recent versions, the immigrant tale is employed in arguments against affirmative action or, more aggressively, against governmental efforts to enforce anti-discrimination laws. In this version the immigrant tale contests the notion - assumed to underlie the civil rights approach - that racial discrimination is unique. In this context, racial discrimination is said to be properly characterized as a version of ethnic prejudice that is in part irrational, in part rational - <b>but</b> which, <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>event,</b> dissipates as the group proves its worth, acquires prerequisite skills and education, and as the group assimilates. This Article seeks, {{on the basis of this}} scholarship, to tell a story of the resiliency of racial subordination during the World War II years. This story severely undercuts the power and appeal of the immigrant tale as applied to black inequality; it casts doubts on social capital explanations of group success; and it exposes the insidiousness of the New Racism that has emerged alongside such theories. Perhaps most important, the article shows how the immigrant tale operated to undercut efforts to combat the rise of segregation in the Bay Area and completely undercut any effective remedies to the discrimination suffered by black migrants. Indeed, the immigrant tale operated to deny the very presence of discrimination that was both widespread and obvious...|$|R
5000|$|This idea is {{challenged}} by Augusto Blasi, who is hesitant to whole-heartedly accept this theory. Though Blasi recognizes that intuitions are sometimes valid and may motivate {{us to do}} moral things, {{this is not always}} the case. Blasi emphasizes the importance of moral responsibility and reflection as one analyzes an intuition (p. 423). His main argument is that some, if not most, intuitions tend to be self-centered and self-seeking (p. 397). Those desires and intuitions do not create good moral actions. Blasi critiques Haidt in describing the average person and questioning if this model (having an intuition, acting on it, and then justifying it) always happens. He {{came to the conclusion that}} not everyone follows this model. He accuses Haidt of being a magician, because he is causing a distraction. Haidt is causing people to focus on intuitions and ignore all the other elements like identity or self. Blasi is concerned that the design of experiments made by psychologists today not only reveal, but also hide many parts of humanity. In other words, they are taking something extremely complex and simplifying it, which creates a skewed perspective. In more detail, Blasi proposes Haidt's five default positions on intuition. 1.) Normally moral judgments are caused by intuitions, whether the intuitions are themselves caused by heuristics, or the heuristics are intuitions; whether they are intrinsically based on emotions, or depend on grammar type of rules and externally related to emotions. 2.) Intuitions occur rapidly and appear as unquestionably evident; either the intuitions themselves or their sources are unconscious. 3.) Intuitions are responses to minimal information, are not a result of analyses or reasoning; neither do they require reasoning to appear solid and true. 4.) Reasoning may occur <b>but</b> infrequently. <b>In</b> <b>any</b> <b>event,</b> its purpose, and the purpose of reasons, is not to lead to, and support, a valid judgment, but to justify the judgment after the fact, either to other people or to oneself. Reasons in sum do not have a moral function. 5.) Because such are the empirical facts, the [...] "rationalistic" [...] theories and methods of Piaget and Kohlberg are rejected. Blasi argues that Haidt does not provide adequate evidence to support his position (p. 412) ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} changes of the New York Code of Pleading and Practice of 1848, so at least the code makers believed, was {{to be found in the}} requirement that there should be stated 2 ̆ 2 in ordinary and concise language 2 ̆ 2 the facts constituting each cause of action or defense. It is true that the common law declaration contained allegations which set forth the pleader 2 ̆ 7 s cause in a general way at least; but the emphasis under the common law system of pleading was placed, not so much on getting the facts on record, but rather upon forcing the opposing parties by their successive pleadings to arrive at a single definite issue. In accordance with the natural tendency of all procedural processes towards standardization and formalism, common law pleading had come in large measure to consist of formal general statements which did not set forth the details of the pleader 2 ̆ 7 s case. The codifiers considered this to be a real and serious defect, and they termed their cure for it 2 ̆ 2 the key of the reform 2 ̆ 2 they were advocating. Elsewhere in their code they adapted the existing equity practice to their purpose. In equity pleading very great detail of the kind termed 2 ̆ 2 evidence 2 ̆ 2 was incorporated in the pleadings, due in part to the rules whereby the plaintiff might force the defendant to a discovery of his proof in his answer, and in part to the general requirement of equity that all the evidence must be made a matter of record.
