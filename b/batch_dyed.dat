Over the past two years, faculty and students from the departments of textile engineering, chemistry, and science, textile and apparel management, mechanical and aerospace engineering and industrial engineering have focused on three interdisciplinary projects to achieve the goal. One of the three projects focused on wet processing optimization and control. Improvement of the <b>batch</b> <b>dyeing</b> process through real-time data acquisition and control is the major goal of the project.

Current state-of-the-art commercial dyeing produces shade variations which may require that each dye lot be handled separately. To control shade variation so that downstream mixing of lots is possible, additional variables-pH, conductivity and dye absorbance-must be sensed and controlled. A system that senses variables in real-time has been developed. The system includes a minicomputer to manage and graphically display the real-time data, a sampling system and four sensors. Absorbances of the dyes in the bath are measured by a microcomputercontrolled fiber optics spectrophotometer.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{a project}} conducted under {{a program of}} National Industrial Competitiveness through Energy, Environment, and Economics (NICE{sup 3 }). The program has the objective of developing and demonstrating industrial processes which simultaneously conserve energy and reduce environmental pollution in an economically attractive manner. This project addressed textile <b>dyeing,</b> specifically <b>batch</b> <b>dyeing</b> of nylon carpets with acid dyes, and focused on providing a technically and financially attractive solution which does not impose burdens on the user industry, such as requirements for additional labor or expertise at the production facility. The <b>batch</b> <b>dyeing</b> of carpet is an inherently wasteful process. After each dye cycle, all of the water, energy, and residual chemicals used to dye the carpets are dumped to the drain. Reuse of the spent dyebaths is a proven technique for reducing consumption of water, chemicals, and energy. However, implementation of reuse on a plant-wide or industry-wide scale is impeded by the human involvement required. This NICE{sup 3 } project developed and demonstrated a process for automated dyebath reuse, including a prototype automated analysis system. This required development of a modified dye cycle, incorporating hot-start and hot-termination for two different dye systems, as well as integration of the analysis system with the existing process control and production scheduling systems in the plant. The prototype analysis system was installed on a production beck in a commercial dyehouse, and automated dyebath reuse was demonstrated on carpets of both nylon 6 and nylon 6, 6 polymers {{in a variety of}} colors. The results of the trials show that the automated analysis system can successfully analyze concentrations of multiple dyes in spent dyebaths without operator assistance and that dyebaths can be reconstituted based on these analyses and reused without compromising the quality of the carpets produced. Economic benefits representing savings in water, energy, chemicals, and waste treatment were shown to be approximately three cents per pound of carpet dyed with a reused bath [...] a significant savings for a typical dyehouse processing tens of millions of pounds of carpet per year...|$|R

25|$|The {{appearance}} of slight deviations {{within the same}} colour is called abrash (from Turkish abraş, literally, “speckled, piebald”). Abrash is seen in traditionally dyed oriental rugs. Its occurrence suggests that a single weaver has likely woven the carpet, {{who did not have}} enough time or resources to prepare a sufficient quantity of dyed yarn to complete the rug. Only small batches of wool were dyed from time to time. When one string of wool was used up, the weaver continued with the newly <b>dyed</b> <b>batch.</b> Because the exact hue of colour is rarely met again when a new <b>batch</b> is <b>dyed,</b> the colour of the pile changes when a new row of knots is woven in. As such, the colour variation suggests a village or tribal woven rug, and is appreciated as a sign of quality and authenticity.

40|$|Fact {{sheet on}} an {{analysis}} system for dyebath {{processes in the}} carpet manufacturing industry written for the NICE 3 Program. The Georgia Institute of Technology (G. I. T.) has developed an effective automated dyebath analysis and reuse system that improves the energy, environmental, and economic performance of dyehouse batch operations. The new system enables dyeing solutions to be accurately monitored and adjusted for reuse. According to industry estimates, 160 pounds of water are used to produce each pound of textile product. The current wasteful <b>batch</b> <b>dyeing</b> process requires all water and residual chemicals, {{as well as the}} energy required to heat the mixture for dyeing, to be dumped after one application. Spent dyebaths can only be reused after they are sampled, analyzed, and reconstituted, a process requiring labor and expertise that are unavailable in the dyehouses. Therefore, successful commercial reuse depends on an automated analysis system that precisely analyzes dyebath samples in real-time and provides for reconstitution and reuse. If fully implemented throughout the carpet industry, this innovation is expected to reduce energy consumption by 3. 6 trillion Btu/year. Waste and cost savings will also be substantial. Though this project was developed for nylon carpet dyeing, the technology holds promise for widespread implementation in carpet manufacturing.

They are usually applied from a fine aqueous dispersion containing some dissolved dye. This definition changes the emphasis of that given in the Colour Index (I) to stress the most important fibers and to {{reflect the fact that}} it is the aqueous solution from which dyeing normally takes place, despite the 'low water solubility of the dye. Solutions are characterized by the presence of the solute (dye) as single molecules; i. e., in a monomolecular form. Even in thermofixation and heat transfer printing (Z), where dyeing takes place in the absence of water, the dyes must first sublime into single molecules (dissolve) in air before diffusion into the fiber can take place. The AATCC Buyer's Guide (3) lists over 700 disperse dye products under more than 200 Colour Index names. The majority of these are blues, ca. 30 %; reds, ca. 25 % and yellows, ca. 20 %.

Textile wet processes, {{particularly}} <b>batch</b> <b>dyeing</b> and finishing, consume {{vast quantities}} of water, posing significant demands on the water resources in regions where the industry is concentrated. Some dyebaths offer the potential for reuse, if appropriate adjustments are made for the residual dyes and their effect on product shades. If manufacturers successfully implement reuse, both the textile firm and the community will draw substantial benefits, including reduced consumption of water, energy, and chemicals and reduced wastewater effluent to be treated. Current efforts at Georgia Tech involve development and demonstration of an automated system to analyze the spent dyebaths in a nylon carpet manufacturing process, permitting their reconstitution and reuse without additional labor or expertise. Process water requirements may be reduced by about 7, 300 gallons per batch (> 55 % savings) while reuse of chemicals and energy is estimated to provide a substantial savings of – 4. 3 ¢ per pound of carpet.

These nanoparticles showed the excellent adsorption efficiency towards Eosin dye in aqueous solution. The adsorption studies were carried out at different pH values, dye concentrations, various adsorbent dosages, and contact time in a <b>batch</b> experiment. The <b>dye</b> removal efficiency was found to be decreased with increasing in initial pH of the dye solution, and nanoadsorbent exhibited good dye removal efficiency at acidic pH specially pH 1. Experimental results indicated that the adsorption kinetic data follow a pseudo-first-order rate for tested dye. The isotherm evaluations revealed that the Freundlich model attained better fits to the experimental equilibrium data than the Langmuir and Temkin models.|$|R

Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} assess the biosorption of acid red 18 dyes from aqueous solutions by brown macroalgae biomass “Sargassum glaucescens. ” Materials and Methods: This research was a lab study. S. glaucescens was used as an adsorbent to remove acid red 18. The effect of various parameters such as pH, initial dyes concentration, adsorbent dose and equilibrium contact time were evaluated in <b>batch</b> adsorption. The <b>dye</b> concentration was measured in the wavelength of 506 nm by spectrophotometer. Results: The results showed that the equilibrium time of biosorption was 120 min. Increasing of contact time and adsorbent dose and initial dye concentration can lead to increasing of the removal efficiency. The maximum adsorption capacity of the dye was at pH: 6 respectively. It was found that the data fitted to Freundlich better than Langmuir isotherms of adsorption model. Conclusion: The S. glaucescens biomass had a satisfactory quality in dye adsorption.

40|$|In this study, {{adsorption}} {{technique was}} employed for removal Methyl Red dye. Methyl red dye is azobenzenecarboxylic acid which {{is well known}} used in paper printing and textile dyeing. Increasing of usage dyes has shown increasing of pollution in water where it give severely effect to human health and aquatic life. The adsorption of Methyl Red dye was carried out using agriculture waste which is coconut (Cococ nucifera) coir to optimize the effect of contact time, initial concentration, adsorbent dosage and pH and determine the efficiency of raw and activated carbon of coconut coir in removing methyl red <b>dye.</b> <b>Batch</b> studies were performed to evaluate the effects of various parameters: (contact time, initial concentration, adsorbent dosage and pH), on adsorption capacity of methyl red dye. The results showed that raw coconut coir removed methyl red at maximum capacity at 40 minutes while activated carbon at 20 minutes. Both the adsorbents have removed the dye at highest capacity was at 20 mg/L and pH 2. While the dosage were different where the raw coconut coir at 0. 05 g while activated carbon at 0. 1 g. Coconut coir activated carbon {{was found to be}} more effective than raw coconut coir as adsorbent in removing methyl red dye where it remove 50 % until 80 % while raw coconut coir only removed about 40 % until 60 %...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} a rapid in situ enumeration approach with the adaptation of a direct viable count (DVC) method, utilization of fluorescent probes and a radioisotope labelling technique to assess the physiological responses of bacteria in biofilm disinfection studies without disturbing the integrity of the interfacial community. The experiments were performed in two stages using two model biofilm systems. In the first stage, an environmental isolate (Klebsiella pneumoniae Kp 1) was used to form monolayer biofilms on stainless steel coupons in a stirred <b>batch</b> reactor. Fluorescent <b>dyes,</b> 5 -cyano- 2, 3 -ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) and rhodamine 123 (Rh 123), were chosen to perform this study. CTC is an indicator of bacterial respiratory activity and Rh 123 is incorporated into bacteria in response to transmembrane potential. The intracellular accumulation of these fluorescent dyes can be determined using epifluorescence microscopy. The incorporation of uridine represents the global RNA turnover rate. Conventional enumeration methods, the plate count (PC) and DVC methods were also applied for comparison. Chlorine (0. 25 mg/L, pH 7. 2) and monochloramine (1 mg/L, pH 9. 0) were used to determine the susceptibilities of attached and planktonic bacteria to disinfection. The attached cells did not reveal any more resistance to disinfection than planktonic cells in this system. The results indicated that viable cell densities within biofilm...|$|R
30|$|Some common {{problems}} of textile dyeing industries include uneven or faulty dyeing and formation of color patches on the fabric surface during dyeing and downstream processing of textiles materials. Such {{problems in the}} finished quality of fabric are generally tackled through a chemical stripping process which is a common practice in dyeing industries for the deep shade <b>batches.</b> However, reactive <b>dyes</b> cannot be stripped satisfactorily from cellulosic materials due {{to the formation of}} co-valent bonds between dye and fiber. This research was undertaken using 2.5 % and 5 % bi-hetero reactive dyes on pretreated cotton fabric and dye stripping was carried out in alkali reductive stripping process. The aim of the work was to investigate the effects of dye stripping on the quality of cotton fabric. Strength loss, weight loss, pilling resistance and absorbency of stripped fabric were calculated. Though with the increase of concentration of stripping chemicals and temperature, stripping percentages were improved; processing damage to the fabric such as losses in strength, weight and pilling resistance ratings was found. In contrast, increased fabric absorbency was found due to stripping. This is explained that during stripping, alkaline solution as an intracrystalline swelling agent is effective in loosening the crystalline region of cotton in addition to the amorphous region. Stripping agent can also attack such crystalline region. As a result, cotton fiber can release maximum number of hydroxyl groups which previously formed covalent bonds. This is the reason behind the stripped fabric having more water absorbency.|$|R
40|$|Arthromyces ramosus {{peroxidase}} (ARP) {{has been}} studied extensively to catalyze the oxidation of various phenolic compounds {{in the presence of}} hydrogen peroxide to form polymers which are readily precipitated from solution. The objective of this thesis was to extend research to other industrial wastewaters. Azo dyes and one representative dye breakdown product: 1, 4 -phenylenediamine (p-PD) were chosen. Experiments were conducted to investigate the feasibility and efficiency of using ARP and hydrogen peroxide to reduce the color of the azo dyes and to remove 1, 4 -phenylenediamine (p-PD). All tests were carried out in continuously-stirred <b>batch</b> reactors. The <b>dyes</b> selected included Naphthol Blue Black, Crocein Orange G, Acid Red 4, and Disperse Orange 3. The optimum conditions to achieve highest efficiency of dye color reduction or p-PD removal were determined for the following parameters: pH, ARP concentration, hydrogen peroxide concentration and reaction time. ARP efficiently reduced the color of the selected dyes except Disperse Orange 3 from synthetic wastewater in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The optimum pH for different dyes was 7. 0 [...] 8. 0. The optimum ARP concentration range was from 0. 1 to 0. 2 U/mL, the optimum H 2 O 2 range was from 100 [...] 200 muM for 50 muM dyes and the reaction time needed was less than 1 hour. Experiments were also conducted to reduce the color of the Disperse Orange 3 using zero-valent iron. Results showed that more than 98...|$|R
