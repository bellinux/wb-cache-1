5|$|Waters, Frank. The Earp <b>Brothers</b> <b>of</b> Tombstone. New York: Clarkson N. Potter, Inc., 1960.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Earp {{writers and}} {{researchers}} use Frank Waters' Earp <b>Brothers</b> <b>of</b> Tombstone, {{as their primary}} source for material that presents Wyatt Earp {{as something of a}} villainous monster, aided and abetted by his brothers who were almost brutes. Waters detested the Earps so badly that he presented a book that was terribly flawed, poorly edited, and brimming with prevarications. In his other work, Waters is poetic. In the Earp <b>Brothers</b> <b>of</b> Tombstone, he {{is little more than a}} tabloid hack, trying to slander someone he dislikes. To date, no reason has been uncovered for the bias Frank Waters exhibited against Wyatt Earp and his brothers.|$|E

During their time in WWF, they were managed by Steven Richards and were placed in a short feud with The <b>Brothers</b> <b>of</b> Destruction (The Undertaker and Kane).

5|$|Hasty {{was laid}} down by William Denny and <b>Brothers,</b> <b>of</b> Dumbarton in Scotland on 15 April 1935, {{launched}} on 5 May 1936 and completed on 11 November 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £248,611. She {{was assigned to the}} 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning. Hasty was refitted in Devonport Dockyard in June–July 1939 and she returned to the Mediterranean afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, Kennedy {{joined forces}} with Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in matches against The <b>Brothers</b> <b>of</b> Destruction (Undertaker and Kane) in various combinations. On a November episode of SmackDown!, Kennedy and MVP lost to the <b>Brothers</b> <b>of</b> Destruction three times. After first getting counted out, Theodore Long {{restarted}} the match with no countouts. When they disqualified themselves following a low blow by Kennedy, Long restarted the match again with no countouts and no disqualifications. Kennedy and MVP continued to feud with the brothers, with MVP feuding with Kane while Kennedy challenged the Undertaker to a match at Survivor Series, which was later announced as a First Blood match. Kennedy won the match after MVP turned on him and aimed for {{his head with a}} steel chair, but missed and hit the Undertaker instead, leaving him bleeding. After the match, the Undertaker attacked Kennedy, forcing him to bleed. At Armageddon, Kennedy and the Undertaker met in a final match; they were scheduled in a Last Ride match. In the match, the Undertaker defeated Kennedy.|$|E

5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania became {{increasingly}} interested in extending its territorial rule to Livonia, especially {{to gain control}} of Baltic seaports, such as Riga, and for other economic benefits. Livonia was by the 1550s largely Lutheran, traditionally ruled by the <b>Brothers</b> <b>of</b> the Sword knightly order. This put Poland and Lithuania {{on a collision course with}} Moscow and other regional powers, which had also attempted expansion in that area.|$|E
5|$|The Inter-Fraternity Council, or IFC, is {{the oldest}} of the Greek councils. Founded in 1934, the IFC oversees 32 social fraternities and is led by a {{governing}} board that is elected by the <b>brothers</b> <b>of</b> the member fraternities. The IFC works with the Presidents' Council, which consists of fraternity chapter presidents, to govern the fraternity community.|$|E
5|$|The Livonian <b>Brothers</b> <b>of</b> the Sword {{had been}} all but annihilated in the Battle of Saule in 1236. Even {{if there is no}} other {{evidence}} of their presence in Finland than the earlier papal letter from 1232, both the Archbishop and the Tavastians seem to have been on the move right after their demise. There had also been a revolt against the Germans in Estonia in 1236.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, 1251 {{there was}} a papal bull from Innocent IV 'to his beloved sons the master and <b>brothers</b> <b>of</b> the hospital of the poor at Kincardonel'. They have {{told him about the}} grants from Alan Durward, with the consent of the Bishop of Aberdeen. He now confirms them with his apostolic authority, which no one is to infringe.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{oil tanker}} was {{developed}} in the period from 1877 to 1885. In 1876, Ludvig and Robert Nobel, <b>brothers</b> <b>of</b> Alfred Nobel, founded Branobel (short for Brothers Nobel) in Baku, Azerbaijan. It was, during the late 19th century, one of the largest oil companies in the world.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the fall of Constantinople, the only {{remaining}} territory of the Byzantine Empire was the Despotate of the Morea (Peloponnese), which was ruled by <b>brothers</b> <b>of</b> the last Emperor, Thomas Palaiologos and Demetrios Palaiologos. The Despotate continued on as an independent state by paying an annual tribute to the Ottomans. Incompetent rule, failure to pay the annual tribute and a revolt against the Ottomans finally led to Mehmed II's invasion of Morea in May 1460. Demetrios asked the Ottomans to invade and drive Thomas out. Thomas fled. The Ottomans moved through the Morea and conquered virtually the entire Despotate by the summer. Demetrios thought the Morea would be restored to him to rule, but it was incorporated into the Ottoman fold.|$|E

5|$|During Thomas' episcopate, Finland {{is listed}} among the lands under the papal legate in the Baltic region, {{originally}} the Bishop of Zemgale, Baldwin, and then William of Modena, first on 28 January 1232 and last on 15 July 1244. This was a radical realignment of the bishopric's position, since the Pope had earlier used Swedish bishops {{to assist the}} Finnish church, as evident from papal letters from 1171 (or 1172), 1221 and 1229. On 24 November 1232, the Pope even asked the Livonian <b>Brothers</b> <b>of</b> the Sword to provide forces for the unnamed Bishop of Finland to defend the country against the Novgorodian attacks.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of King Edward the Confessor a lady called Elviva (probably a Latin {{rendering}} of the Old English name Ælfgifu), held the manor of Ambrosden. The Domesday Book records that by 1086 she {{had been replaced by}} Hugh d'Ivry, butler of William the Conqueror and brother of Roger d'Ivry, who owned several manors in Oxfordshire. Hugh's nephew Roger II d'Ivry inherited Ambrosden and by 1194 {{it was part of the}} Honour of St. Valery. Ambrosden thus passed to Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall, who in 1288 gave the manor to Ashridge Priory of the Augustinian order of the <b>Brothers</b> <b>of</b> Penitence. Ashridge Priory retained Ambrosden until the priory was dissolved in 1539 in the Dissolution of the Monasteries.|$|E
5|$|He {{sold the}} {{building}} at a low price that year, to Charles Carpy, who deeded the property to the California Wine Association. The association continued using the Greystone Cellars wine label. A year later, the Bisceglia <b>brothers</b> <b>of</b> San Jose purchased Greystone where they produced sacramental wine under the same label until 1930, and again beginning in October 1933. The Carpy family maintained part of the land, including a Victorian house nicknamed Albert's Villa south of the winery. The house burned down around 1929 and was replaced with a Spanish-style house that is now owned by the school.|$|E
