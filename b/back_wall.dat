5|$|Cave 22 adjoins cave 21 on {{the left}} and it was also a {{dwelling}} unit with a bench for {{the entire length of the}} <b>back</b> <b>wall.</b> A window from this hall overlooks another smaller room. An entry through a grooved door gives access to a long corridor and in the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of which is an inscription that discloses the name of the donor and the monastic order.|$|E
5|$|Light {{falls on}} the {{pictorial}} space from the left, creating shadows against the <b>back</b> <b>wall,</b> the strongest cast by the girl's hennin. The depth of space provided by the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> gives room for this detailing, which Charles Sterling believes is indebted to van Eyck. The light throws a murky but curved shadow {{on the wall behind}} the girl and acts as a counterpoint to the contour of her cheek and hairline.|$|E
5|$|Cave 3 has an open veranda and a cell. The veranda has a bench {{along the}} <b>back</b> <b>wall.</b> A {{door leads to}} a cell, which has a seat in a left recess. In front of the recess, below the seat, are {{vertical}} bands. Between caves 2 and 3 there is {{a seat in the}} front, in a recess.|$|E

5|$|Cave 4 has an open veranda and a cell. The veranda has a bench, {{along the}} <b>back</b> <b>wall.</b> A grooved {{door leads to}} a cell, which has a bench along the right wall. A broken window is {{to the left of}} door and to its right, a small hole, which could have been used to wash feet before {{entering}} the cell.|$|E
5|$|Cave 8 is a difficult-to-reach dwelling. It {{consists}} of a veranda with a cell and a half cell in its <b>back</b> <b>wall,</b> both entered through the veranda. The cell has a broken door, a small window, benched recess and a peg hole. The half cell has an open front and a bench at the back.|$|E
5|$|Platform D5 is a south-facing range {{structure}} of great length {{with just two}} access stairways. Excavations uncovered a number of funerary urns deposited under the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of the structure, the only example burial urns being interred behind such a platform.|$|E
50|$|Yogeswaran's {{house in}} Jaffna was burnt {{down on the}} night of 31 May 1981 by a mob of Sinhalese policemen and paramilitaries. Yogeswaran and his wife managed to escape by jumping over their <b>back</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{commercial}} cinema, {{where there}} is a large area to cover, it would be impractical to use a single speaker for each surround channel. Theater auditoria are often lined with speakers all along the side and <b>back</b> <b>walls.</b> This is to increase the size of the listening area. JBL states that surround speakers should be spaced evenly along the side and <b>back</b> <b>walls,</b> starting at no closer than 1/3 of the room length from the screen (so the surrounds do not interfere with the front channels) and should be located at about 10-12 feet high and angled down to face the opposite wall-floor boundary.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{original}} location, at Beverly & Rampart. The Shack {{is in the}} foreground, {{the building}} surrounding is {{also a part of}} the restaurant. Patrons eat at their cars or standing at the counter along the <b>back</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{mirror on}} the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> {{reflects}} the upper bodies and heads of two figures identified from other paintings, and by Palomino, as King PhilipIV(10) and Queen Mariana(11). The most common assumption is that the reflection shows the couple in the pose they are holding for Velázquez as he paints them, while their daughter watches; and that the painting therefore shows {{their view of the}} scene.|$|E
5|$|All {{the figures}} are adorned with carved {{ornaments}} and surrounded by borders with reliefs of animals and birds. The lotus design is a common theme. On the ceiling are images of the Vidyadhara couples as well as couples in courtship and erotic Mithuna scenes. Through a cleft in the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of the cave is a square sanctuary with more carved images. In the mandapa is a seated Nandi facing the garbha ghriya (sacrum sanctum) containing a Shiva linga.|$|E
5|$|Next to it, but {{higher up}} and almost inaccessible, are two cells; then a well; and, thirdly, a small vihara, with three cells, {{two of them}} with stone-beds. Some rough cutting on the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> between the cell-doors resembles a dagoba in low relief, but it is quite unfinished. Outside are two more cells and a chamber or chapel {{at the end of}} a veranda that runs along in front both of the vihara and the cells.|$|E
5000|$|The “New Pass” {{was until}} the 15th century still wetland. Today the B 3 runs here along the {{historic}} town wall through town.

5|$|Five sculptors {{executed}} {{a total of}} thirteen such scenes, {{not only on the}} front and <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> of zoo buildings, but also on all four sides of both brick entrance shelters at Flatbush Avenue. However, the positioning of some of the bas-reliefs makes them less accessible than others.|$|R
50|$|Normal {{sinus rhythm}} is {{established}} by the sinoatrial (SA) node, the heart's pacemaker. The SA node is a specialized grouping of cardiomyocytes in the upper and <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> of the right atrium {{very close to the}} opening of the superior vena cava. The SA node has the highest rate of depolarization.|$|R
5|$|The {{paintings}} on the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> are recognized as representing Minerva Punishing Arachne and Apollo's Victory Over Marsyas. Both stories involve Minerva, the Goddess of Wisdom and patron of the arts. These two legends are both stories of mortals challenging gods and the dreadful consequences. One scholar {{points out that the}} legend dealing with two women, Minerva and Arachne, is {{on the same side of}} the mirror as the queen's reflection while the male legend is on the side of the king.|$|E
5|$|Cave 12 {{is a small}} {{dwelling}} {{entered by}} a door from the veranda of cave 11. It has its own open veranda, which has a partly broken floor and ceiling and recessed benches {{on the left and}} right of the door to the middle room. The middle room has a small window {{to the left of the}} door and a seat recess in its right wall. In the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of the middle room to the left is a half cell - which has a seat recess - and a cell with a grooved door. The floor of the cave has a coating of cement, while the ceiling of the middle room bears painted concentric circles.|$|E
5|$|John Kadlec, a {{consulting}} engineer {{on the original}} construction, has testified that he raised concerns at the time about sloppy workmanship and inadequate construction materials at the site, including structural columns that were already crooked, steel beams that were already rusting despite being new, and the ultimately fateful decision to place the complex's parking area on the roof. According to Kadlec, the construction company opted to resolve the structural issues not by redoing the construction, but by anchoring the building's <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> to the rock outcropping behind it. James Keywan, the building's original architect, testified that he also strongly objected to the rooftop parking, but had little choice once Algocen made their decision to proceed with that plan.|$|E
50|$|The {{body and}} chassis are {{completely}} welded construction with crew compartments on both ends. It contains two machine compartments and one high voltage compartment. Moving between crew cabins is enabled by 570 mm wide corridor {{running along the}} box wall. machine compartments are reached through the doors in the <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> of crew compartments.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of San Francisco {{earthquake}} damage, {{showing an}} interior {{view of the}} ruins of Hale's, 1906. A charred, skeletal frame is all that remains inside the building. The bricks of the interior walls as well as various pipes and metal pieces blanket the floor. The absence of the roof has allowed sunlight to fill the <b>back</b> <b>walls...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{passenger}} {{building is a}} rectangular structure on two levels. On the ground floor, there are services for travellers and guests, and upstairs are offices. The ground floor is made of brick and has eleven arches. The upper floor is faced with brick and its front and <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> have eleven mullioned windows decorated with a cornice.|$|R
5|$|On June 10, a {{powerful}} squall line of thunderstorms with embedded supercells developed across New York and moved northeast through parts of northern New England and Quebec. Particularly hard hit was the Montreal region and its southern suburbs including Longueuil, Châteauguay, Brossard and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. Barns were reported damaged and other structures sustained roof and siding damage; {{particularly in the}} Saint-Blaise-sur-Richelieu area where one home was pushed from its foundation. In Sainte-Catherine, the roof of an office was blown into a nearby residence punching a large hole on the <b>back</b> <b>wall.</b> On Montreal's Champlain Bridge, eight tractor trailers were overturned forcing {{the closure of the}} entire bridge in both directions. In addition, a window washing platform tumbled from a high rise building in downtown Montreal. The workers were able to get inside.|$|E
5|$|One monk {{was thrown}} from a balcony {{down to the}} {{courtyard}} six meters below. Nhu's men vandalized the main altar and confiscated the intact charred heart of Thích Quảng Đức, which had failed to burn during his re-cremation. However, some of the Buddhists were able to flee the pagoda with a receptacle containing his ashes. Two monks jumped the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of Xá Lợi to enter {{the grounds of the}} adjoining United States Agency for International Development (USAID) mission, where they were given asylum, despite the presence of troops behind the pagoda walls who opened fire with automatic weapons on any monks who tried to flee by jumping the fence.|$|E
5|$|Platform A6 {{encloses}} {{the western}} extreme of the Group A plaza. The platform has two levels, the upper {{of which has}} a vertical cornice. The platform faces east onto the plaza; access was via two stairways flanked by balustrades terminating in vertical cornices. Platform A6 was built over an older {{version of the same}} building; this earlier construction phase was smaller and its stairways were destroyed in order to build the stairways of the final version. During restoration work carried out by archaeologists the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> and a section of the facade were left exposed. Four funerary urns were found associated with the platform, mostly interred under the front of the building.|$|E
50|$|Since early Lycian times, the city's {{settlement}} was likely {{concentrated on the}} southern slope and western slopes. Wide terraces with cisterns and the <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> of buildings carved from the rock are found there, {{as well as an}} agora, a Roman-era theatre, for plays and concerts, public roman baths and the remains of an early Byzantine church.|$|R

50|$|Level 1 {{is home to}} ten racquetball courts (eight {{of which}} have glass <b>back</b> <b>walls,</b> and two of which have solid black walls), {{as well as an}} {{observation}} lounge. Two of the courts are even marked for wallyball and squash. It also is home to the Outdoor Connection Center, where various outdoor equipment can be rented at a nominal fee.|$|R
5|$|Platform B5 {{possesses}} two stepped {{levels with}} cornices and encloses {{the northern part}} of the west side of the Group B plaza. The lower level possesses a single inset stairway, while the upper terrace has two stairways flanked by balustrades, with a third balustrade dividing the two. The platform provides a broad view across the Pancaco River valley to the west. Structure B5 was built on top of an earlier construction phase, which is exposed along the upper portion of the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> because restoration of the building only rebuilt the lower portion. It was built from stone slabs and was originally taller than the final version of the platform but was cut back to the reduced height of the new building.|$|E
5|$|The Arnolfini {{is named}} after Jan van Eyck's {{masterpiece}} The Arnolfini Portrait (1434) depicting the merchant and arts patron Giovanni Arnolfini. The Arnolfini Portrait {{is one of the}} earliest paintings to assert the presence of the artist within its depiction (an inscription {{in the middle of the}} work and a reflection in a mirror on the <b>back</b> <b>wall)</b> and one of Arnolfini's consistent concerns: to explore the role of artist as a witness and recorder of what is around them – contemporary society. The painting is in the National Gallery, London and it was one of the founder's favourite paintings.|$|E
5|$|The <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of the room, {{which is}} in shadow, is hung with rows of paintings, {{including}} {{one of a series}} of scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses by Peter Paul Rubens, and copies, by Velázquez's son-in-law and principal assistant Juan del Mazo, of works by Jacob Jordaens. The paintings are shown in the exact positions recorded in an inventory taken around this time. The wall to the right is hung with a grid of eight smaller paintings, visible mainly as frames owing to their angle from the viewer. They can be identified from the inventory as more Mazo copies of paintings from the Rubens Ovid series, though only two of the subjects can be seen.|$|E
50|$|This is {{considered}} a militaristic church {{in that it was}} planned as a ‘fortress church’ and the proof of this {{can be seen in the}} massive buttresses which support the front and <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> of the church. The church was built to replace churches that had been destroyed by an earthquake in 1612 and subsequent churches that had been destroyed by fires.|$|R
25|$|After the serve, {{the players}} take turns {{hitting the ball}} against the front wall, above the tin and below the out line. The ball may strike the side or <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> at any time, {{as long as it}} hits below the out line. It must not hit the floor after hitting the racket and before hitting the front wall. A ball landing on either the out line or the line {{along the top of the}} tin is {{considered}} to be out. After the ball hits the front wall, it is allowed to bounce once on the floor (and any number of times against the side or <b>back</b> <b>walls)</b> before a player must return it. Players may move anywhere around the court but accidental or deliberate obstruction of the other player's movements is forbidden and could result in a let or a stroke. Players typically return to the centre of the court after making a shot.|$|R
