50|$|Bleached kraft is {{received}} in bales from Canadian mills. Fork trucks deliver a six-bale stack to <b>bale</b> <b>handling</b> equipment for destacking and dewiring. A dewiring system, the first automatic {{one in the}} industry, dewires bales before they are dumped from the conveyor to the pulper; the slush pulp is then pumped to a soak chest, refiners, and storage tank.|$|E
40|$|Biomass bales {{often need}} to be {{aggregated}} (collected into groups and transported) to a field-edge stack or a temporary storage before utilization. Several logistics scenarios for aggregation involving equipment and aggregation strategies were modeled and evaluated. Cumulative Euclidean distance criteria evaluated the various aggregation scenarios. Application of a single-bale loader that aggregated bales individually was considered as the “control” scenario with which others were compared. A computer simulation program developed determined bale coordinates in ideal and random layouts that evaluated aggregation scenarios. Simulation results exhibited a “diamond pattern” of bales on ideal layout and a “random pattern” emerged when ≥ 10 % variation was introduced. Statistical analysis revealed {{that the effect of}} field shape, swath width, biomass yield, and randomness on bale layout did not affect aggregation logistics, while area and number of <b>bales</b> <b>handled</b> had significant effects. Number of <b>bales</b> <b>handled</b> in the direct method significantly influenced the efficiency. Self-loading bale picker with minimum distance path (MDP, 80 %) and parallel transport of loader and truck with MDP (78 %) were ranked the highest, and single-bale central grouping the lowest (29 %) among 19 methods studied. The MDP was found significantly more efficient (4 %- 16 %) than the baler path. Simplistic methods, namely a direct triple-bale loader with MDP (64 %- 66 %), or a loader and truck <b>handling</b> six <b>bales</b> running parallel with MDP (75 %- 82 %) were highly efficient. Great savings on cumulative distances that directly influence time, fuel, and cost were realized when the number of <b>bales</b> <b>handled</b> was increased or additional equipment was utilized...|$|R

50|$|One recent {{method of}} {{speeding}} up all this manual <b>bale</b> <b>handling</b> is the bale shredder, {{which is a}} large vertical drum with rotary cutting/ripping teeth {{at the base of}} the drum. The shredder is placed under the chute and several bales dropped in. A worker then pushes the shredder along the barn aisle as it rips up a bale and spews it out in a continuous fluffy stream of material.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} tool for large round <b>bale</b> <b>handling</b> is the bale spear or spike, {{which is usually}} mounted {{on the back of}} a tractor or the front of a skid-steer. It is inserted into the approximate center of the round bale, then lifted and the bale is hauled away. Once at the destination, the bale is set down, and the spear pulled out. Careful placement of the spear in the center is needed or the bale can spin around and touch the ground while in transport, causing a loss of control. When used for wrapped bales that are to be stored further, the spear makes a hole in the wrapping that must be sealed with plastic tape to maintain a hermetic seal.|$|E

5000|$|The loader {{assembly}} may be {{a removable}} attachment or permanently mounted. Often the bucket can be replaced with other devices or tools—for example, many can mount forks to lift heavy pallets or shipping containers, and a hydraulically opening [...] "clamshell" [...] bucket allows a loader {{to act as a}} light dozer or scraper. The bucket can also be augmented with devices like a <b>bale</b> grappler for <b>handling</b> large <b>bales</b> of hay or straw.|$|R
50|$|During World War I, Louden's {{monorail}} litter carrier {{was adapted}} to industrial uses, including {{the manufacture of}} ammunition. By the 1920s, the company earned much of its revenue from industrial applications of Louden Monorail to carry equipment in factories of companies such as Allis-Chalmers and General Motors. The company also established a Louden Engineers division to design custom adaptations of Louden Monorail {{in a variety of}} contexts, including factories, foundries, industrial dipping machines, clothing <b>handling,</b> <b>bales</b> of cotton, motion picture lighting.|$|R
40|$|I’ve {{tried to}} find the most {{effective}} and cost effective way to harvest straw for energy recovery. You can choose between round bales and big square bales. Square bales are the cheapest way to produce straw for fuel recovery because you can optimize the length of the bales so they fit the transportation equipment. In the Malmö area the average days of harvesting hay is 55. The effectively of transportation depends mostly of the speed, the distance and density of the bales. To increase the capacity of bale transportation larger loads and higher density of the bales is necessary. The traffic rules limit the size of the transportation vehicles. Straw is fully storable with a humidity of 18 % but the most straw power plants accepts a humidity of 20 %. The most contract hay harvesting company’s stops baling at a humidity of 19 %. The storage of the bales is first on the field and later on a bigger storage area. There are plenty of systems to choose between when collecting bales from the field to the storage area. The cheapest way for collecting bales from field to the storage area on the field is with a tractor and an automatic bale collector. The system is cheapest because there is only one man required for collecting and stacking. No Wheel loader is nesessary in this system. Handle the straw are expensive. Each time you move a bale the bale-cost rise. It’s important have an effective handling of the bales and reduces the number of times the bales will be removed to lover the cost of <b>bale</b> <b>handling.</b> The wheel loader gets more effective if it’s equipped with a bale squeeze then a bale spear during truck loading. If the baler is equipped with a bale collector you save a lot of time during <b>bale</b> <b>handling,</b> you don’t need to collect the bales with a wheel loader on the whole field because the bales are automatically collected on the field’s turning point. Conclusions: • Big square bales are the cheapest {{and the best way to}} produce hay bales. • Tractor and automatic bale collector are the most economic way to collect a big number of round bales and square bales. • To increase the capacity of bale transportation larger loads and higher density of the bales is necessary. • Balers equipped with cutting section are more expensive than regular balers even when it’s used more hours per yea...|$|E
50|$|These loaders are {{a popular}} {{addition}} to tractors from 50 to 200 hp. Its current 'drive-in' form was originally designed and developed in 1958 by a Swedish company named Ålö when they launched their Quicke loader. Tractor loaders {{were developed to}} perform a multitude of farming tasks, and are popular due to their relatively low cost (compared to Telehandler) and high versatility. Tractor loaders can be fitted with many attachments such as hydraulic grabs and spikes to assist with <b>bale</b> and silage <b>handling,</b> forks for pallet work, and buckets for more general farm activities.|$|R
5000|$|Immediately before {{classing}} ‘skirting’ happened, {{the object}} being {{to render the}} fleece as evenly as possible by removing any wool which did not match the major portion of the fleece. Once a fleece has been <b>handled,</b> <b>baled</b> and pressed it did not lend itself to further skirting. Skirting and packing enhanced {{the value of the}} wool clip as a whole. Classing {{was one of the most}} important jobs i.e. grading of the skirted fleece in its entirety. This was the application of sounds knowledge acquired from experience and practice. Wool was put into lines according to its class. The first thing was to separate the Woollen and Worsted by the Wool Sorters, then the fleece was graded according to the following factors: ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{alternative}} method, the cut vegetation is baled, making balage (North America) or silage bales (UK). The grass or other forage is cut and partly dried until it contains 30-40% moisture (much drier than bulk silage, but too damp {{to be stored}} as dry hay). It is then made into large bales which are wrapped tightly in plastic to exclude air. The plastic may wrap the whole of each cylindrical or cuboid bale, or be wrapped around only the curved sides of a cylindrical bale, leaving the ends uncovered. In this case, the bales are placed tightly end to end on the ground, making a long continuous [...] "sausage" [...] of silage, often {{at the side of}} a field. The wrapping may be performed by a bale wrapper, while the <b>baled</b> silage is <b>handled</b> using a <b>bale</b> handler or a front-loader, either impaling the bale on a flap, or by using a special grab. The flaps do not hole the bales.|$|R
40|$|With {{cellulosic}} {{energy production}} from {{various forms of}} biomass becoming popular in renewable energy research, agricultural producers may {{be called upon to}} plant and harvest switchgrass or collect corn stover to supply such energy production to nearby facilities. Determining the entire production and transportation cost to the producer of switchgrass or corn stover and the amount available within a given distance of the plant will result in a per ton cost the plant will need to pay producers in order to be supplied with sufficient quantities of biomass. This research computes up-to-date biomass production costs using recent prices for all important cost components including seed, fertilizer and herbicide application, mowing/shredding, raking, <b>baling,</b> storage, <b>handling,</b> and transportation. The cost estimates also include nutrient replacement for corn stover. The total per ton cost for either switchgrass or corn stover is a combination of these cost components depending on whether equipment is owned or custom hired, what baling options are used, the size of the farm, and the distance that biomass must be transported. Total per ton costs for transporting biomass 30 miles range between $ 39 and $ 46 for corn stover and $ 57 and $ 63 for switchgrass. Using the county quantity data and this cost information, we then estimated biomass supply curves for three Indiana coal-fired electric utility. This supply framework can be applied to plants of any size, location, and type. Finally, we estimated the greenhouse gas emissions reduction from using biomass instead of coal for part of the utility energy and also the carbon tax required to make the biomass cost equivalent to coal.

40|$|Large square baling is {{currently}} {{recognized as a}} high efficiency biomass harvesting system. Baling, bale collecting, and storing at a commercial wheat straw farm was studied as a typical large square bale harvesting system. Factors that affect large square <b>bale</b> production and <b>handling</b> logistics were quantified. Field operations of a large square baler, two bale handlers, and three bale trucks were observed in a full day field operation. System performance was analyzed and material capacities of all machines used in this system were determined based on field measurements. System limitations were quantified, and means to increase system efficiency or reduce production costs were discussed. Results showed that 340 wheat straw bales at a density of 116 kg·m- 3 (wet matter) were made with a single large square baler during 8 h field operations. The number of bales produced was the system limitation when one baler, two bale handlers and three bale trucks were used. Adding a baler or {{reduce the number of}} operators can increase system efficiency. The large square baler used in this study had a material capacity of 13 Mg·h- 1 . Similar baling trials were conducted in a switchgrass field and results indicated that the baler had the same material capacity...|$|R
40|$|Scrap tire bales are {{typically}} treated as discrete elements that consist of approximately one hundred (100) scrap tires compressed into a 4. 5 foot by 5 foot by 2. 5 foot block. The advantage of baling tires {{is that a}} volume reduction of approximately ten (10) is achieved, and <b>handling</b> <b>bales</b> is much simpler, and therefore cheaper, than whole tire or tire shreds. The use of tire bales in highway structures, however, requires that the mechanical properties of the tire bales are known. Determining these properties {{is vital to the}} proper design and construction of the tire bale structures. A literature review indicated the lack of material properties that are available for tire bales. A laboratory testing program was designed and implemented to determine the strength and compressibility properties of the bales required for design. Field testing to determine the unit weight and permeability of the tire bale mass was also conducted. Analytical studies and cost benefit analyses highlighting the benefits of using tire bales already assembled were also conducted for a series of tire bale case histories. The following document outlines all the work conducted as part of this, as well as previous, testing programs to determine the properties needed for design of tire bales structures, as well as economical aspects of reusing the tires as opposed t...|$|R
