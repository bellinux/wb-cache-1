5|$|Plans for DLC {{were first}} {{announced}} in August 2010, with it being planned {{as an extension}} of the game. The developers initially did not plan for DLC, with it beginning development later in the game's production when the visual theme was finalized. Despite using only core team members, development was slow due to the main focus being on Human Revolution. For The Missing Link, the team improved the lighting, gameplay mechanics, player freedom, and character animation. The DLC was developed entirely at Eidos Montréal, and this gave the team the opportunity of developing a boss fight with multiple solutions, something they regretted not <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the main game.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit {{drinking}} in 1972, {{and at first}} Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything about it. It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he always kept a bottle with him. Vainio began to realize that he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E

5|$|Yui {{is a big}} fan and {{initially}} an assistant to Girls Dead Monster. She {{is known to be}} hyperactive and talks extremely fast. Hinata finds Yui annoying, which results in bouts {{between the two of them}} though in truth, they truly care about one another, saying that had they met before they died, they would have fallen in love with one another. She wears a devil tail and shackle bracelets on her wrists, giving her an image of an imp or devil. She also has wings hidden by her hair on her back. After Iwasawa's departure, Yui becomes the new rhythm guitarist and vocalist of Girls Dead Monster, as well as its leader. Yui plays a Gibson SG Special electric guitar. She later becomes a part of the main SSS, following them along on missions, though she does not contribute much. In life, she was hit by a car and was paralyzed from a young age as a result. Her regret was not <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything with her body.

Nonetheless, Filch is at least able to use wizarding devices that have their own innate magic, such as the Secrecy Sensor used in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. It is hinted that his dislike of students may stem from his disappointment and jealousy at not <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> magic. In the Half Blood Prince, Harry and Hermione jokingly suspect that he is in a relationship with Irma Pince, the librarian at Hogwarts. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the final book, when the school starts preparing itself for the Battle of Hogwarts, Filch is seen yelling that students are out of bed.

The Supreme defines power as <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> through others what we are unable to do ourselves: language, being separate from what it designates, is the very embodiment of power, for things act and mean through it without ceasing to be themselves.

[...] The Hudson's Bay Company has recently surveyed lots of land that were intended to be sold as property, however word broke out that the particular are of land was the only land surveyed in the entire district. People attracted to the area were unable to afford land, and therefore built shacks. As more claim-jumpers moved in, it was requested that they move three or four miles outwards, but they refused. McCauley sent many urgent messages to Ottawa to settle the dispute in a civil manner, but to no avail. As a result of the government not <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything, and the lack of a law enforcement agency in the town, a group of prominent citizens formed a [...] "Protective Association" [...] as an attempt to restore law and order, to which McCauley was elected its captain.|$|E
500|$|José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, {{also known}} as [...] "Dr. Francia", Karaí-Guasú ("Great Lord" [...] in Guaraní), or [...] "the Supreme", is the book's titular {{character}} and also undoubtedly its main focus. Most {{of the book is}} dedicated to his dictates to his secretary, Patiño. The Supreme is a domineering man, frequently belittling his closest confidant. He is also an infirm man, as the book is set a short time before his death on September 20, 1840. Roa Bastos's portrayal of him walks the line between praise and condemnation. While other authors of dictator novels clearly present their dictators as villains, Roa Bastos makes it unclear as to whether he is defending him or not. As Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria writes, the Supreme is [...] "constant [...] about writing. [...] {{stems from the fact that}} he has found and used the power implicit in language itself.

2500|$|In 1982, Self Help {{began an}} [...] "Experimental Screenprint Atelier", a {{workshop}} in fine art serigraphy. Serigraphy was {{a technique that}} was more expensive and required greater expertise than the silkscreening. As such, it represented {{a departure from the}} Chicano sensibility of rasquachismo, or a humorous sense of pride in <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> make <b>do</b> with limited resources. Nonetheless, it gave artists greater latitude for individual expression, and created a higher-quality product, which resulted in greater prestige for both the artists and the center. The shift was also a means to concentrate the center's resources, which were becoming limited due to Reagan Administration-era cutbacks in social spending. The production of higher-quality works also opened up the possibility of funding Self Help activities through the sales of prints. Stephen Rose was the first master printer, Oscar Duardo the second, and José Alpuche the third and current.|$|R

He worked through these {{concerns}} by justifying Gus' actions in that, by killing Victor, he was protecting everyone else who works for him. Nevertheless, he said it was [...] "a difficult moment for me" [...] to slit Victor's throat, and that during one take he tried to hush the character to make him die more calmly. That scene took two days to film, and Esposito remained silent and focused during filming, rarely speaking to the others on set. The boots he was originally given were too large and he was concerned that he would slip, which would be out of character for Gus, who was otherwise completely calm and in control. A costume designer quickly procured the right-sized boots for him.|$|E
