5|$|In March, Congressman Darrell Issa, {{the ranking}} Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, {{sent a letter}} to White House Counsel Robert Bauer stating if Sestak's claim was true, the Obama {{administration}} may have violated a federal statue that makes it illegal for a government employee to use his authority to interfere with a Senate election. Interest in the alleged job offer reignited after Sestak defeated Specter in the primary on May 18. Seven Republicans from the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder seeking a review of the legal implications of the offer. Around this time, Sestak continued to maintain that a job offer was made, but he downplayed the importance of the incident and defended Obama's integrity. On May 28, the White House formally responded to the allegations and acknowledged White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel enlisted former President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> offer Sestak a seat on a presidential advisory board or another executive board if Sestak dropped his candidacy. If Sestak accepted, he would have been allowed to remain in the House while serving in the unpaid position.|$|E

The crimes prompted president <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> visit South Carolina in 1996 and pledge federal help in investigating the crimes.

25|$|Obama {{continued}} Plan Colombia, {{a diplomatic}} aid initiative launched by President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> aid Colombia's economy.

In addition to continuing Plan Colombia, Obama appointed Bernard Aronson as a special envoy to the peace process between the Colombian government and FARC in order to facilitate negotiations. However, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and others criticized Obama for engaging with FARC, an organization that appears on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations.

25|$|Waters {{has visited}} Cuba {{a number of}} times, praised Fidel Castro's moves towards {{democracy}} and criticized US efforts to overthrow him, and demanded {{an end to the}} U.S. trade embargo. In 1998 Waters wrote a letter to Castro citing the 1960s and 1970s as “a sad and shameful chapter of our history,” and thanked Castro for providing help to those who needed to “flee political persecution.” In 1998, Waters wrote an open letter to Fidel Castro asking him not to extradite African-American activist and convicted murderer Assata Shakur because much of the Black community regards his conviction as false. After a woman drowned during an attempted escape from Cuba to the U.S. in 1999, leaving a six-year-old son, Elian Gonzales, who survived and requested asylum in the U.S., Waters called on President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> return him at once to Cuba.|$|E

25|$|Paul {{emerged in}} 2000 {{as the largest}} {{contributor}} to Senatorial candidate Hillary Clinton. Paul and his attorneys have at various times offered two explanations for this. First, {{that he was trying}} to attract her husband, then-President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton,</b> <b>to</b> serve on the board of Stan Lee Media after leaving office. Second, that he hoped to negotiate a pardon for his previous criminal convictions. Paul produced and underwrote what he described as the largest fund raising event ever held for a federal candidate, in Los Angeles, days before the 2000 Democratic Convention began. The Hollywood Farewell Gala Salute to President William Jefferson Clinton featured prominent entertainers singing for the President, while raising over $1 million for Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign. The event cost $1.9 million to organize according to Paul and $500,000 according to the Federal Election Commission filing, much of it borrowed fraudulently by Paul from Merrill Lynch. Later indictments would state that Merrill Lynch lost about $5 million it had lent to Paul.|$|E
25|$|Klonsky {{became one}} of the leaders of the modern small schools {{movement}} which has done much to transform the face of secondary school education in the United State. His academic work focused on small school size as a solution to the problems of inner city schools; his early research on issues of school size and its impact on student achievement, school violence, and dropout rates, helped pave the way towards the development of thousands of new small and charter schools across the country. By 1996, he was the director of the Small Schools Workshop at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and in 1999, he was named by president <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> the Academic Advisory Council of the National Campaign Against Youth Violence, where he advocated small schools as a mechanism for violence reduction. Klonsky is now a retired professor of education after teaching at several universities, including UIC and the Fischler School of Education at Nova Southeastern University.|$|E
