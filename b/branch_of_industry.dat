25|$|In {{defense of}} {{the theory that the}} organic {{composition}} of capital does rise in the long term (lowering the average rate of profit), Mandel claimed that there does not exist any <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> where wages are a growing proportion of total production costs, as a secular trend. The real trend is the other way: toward semi-automation and full automation which lowers total labor costs in the total capital outlay. Critics of that idea point to low-wage countries like China, where the long run trend is for average real wages to rise. For example, the Chinese Communist Party aims to double Chinese workers' wages by 2020.|$|E
25|$|As Prof. Okishio himself acknowledged, his {{argument}} {{is based on}} a comparative static analysis. His starting point is an equilibrium growth path of an economy with a given technique. In a given <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry,</b> a technical improvement is introduced (in a way similar to what Marx described) and then the new equilibrium growth path is established under the assumption that the new technique is generally adopted by the capitalists of that branch. The result is that even under Marx's assumptions about technical progress, the new equilibrium growth path goes along with a higher rate of profit. However, if one drops the assumption that a capitalist economy moves from one equilibrium to another, this result no longer holds. There is no real evidence that capitalist development spontaneously tends to equilibrium, since there are continuously market fluctuations, mismatches of supply and demand, and periodic economic crises. In addition perfect competition does not exist, and corporations may actively try to block competitors in their markets (e.g. European Union Microsoft competition case).|$|E

500|$|Although the IWW {{was built}} on the basis of uniting workers of industry, a rift began between the union and the Socialist Party. It started when the electoral wing of the Socialist Party, led by Victor Berger and Morris Hillquit, became irritated with speeches by Haywood. In December 1911, Haywood told a Lower East Side {{audience}} at New York's Cooper Union that parliamentary Socialists were [...] "step-at-a-time people whose every step is just a little shorter than the preceding step." [...] It was better, Haywood said, to [...] "elect the superintendent of some <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry,</b> than to elect some congressman to the United States Congress." [...] In response, Hillquit attacked the IWW as [...] "purely anarchistic..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The elected {{board of}} {{managers}} {{was to make}} the business decisions of the phalanx and to differentiate and assess the various types of work.

2500|$|The canton of Glarus is {{dominated}} by the deep valley of the Linth River and the smaller Sernftal on the east. Most of the area is mountainous. The highest peak in the Glarus Alps is the Tödi at [...] Other mountains include the Hausstock (...) and the Glärnisch (...) [...] The canton contains part of a thrust fault that was declared a geologic UNESCO world heritage site, under the name Swiss Tectonic Arena Sardona, in 2008. Famous outcrops in the Swiss Tectonic Arena Sardona include those at Lochsite near Glarus and in a mountain cliff called Tschingelhörner between Elm and Flims (in the same cliff is a natural hole called the Martinsloch). There is also a large lake called Walensee (Lake Walen) on the north. The total area of the canton of Glarus is , of which about half is considered productive. Forestry is an important <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> in the canton.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} {{production}} {{concentration of the}} mining and metallurgical <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> in the Dnipro region {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th century (1900 – 1917) is analyzed. The specific features of the process development in the Dnipro region of the Russian empire are characterized. The policy of the tsarist government and mining and metallurgical businessmen concerning the process of concentration is regarded. Difficult social-political and economic situation in the Russian empire and in the world {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century, undoubtedly, influenced upon the development of the mining and metallurgical <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> in the Dnipro region of Ukraine. The world industrial-economic crisis hampered the development of the mining and metallurgical <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry.</b> At the same time the process <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> concentration occurred and syndicates were created. Industrial and bank capitals were united. After the world economic crisis, the Russian-Japanese war, revolutionary events of 1905 – 1907, there was the rise in the development of the mining and metallurgical <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry.</b> New plants were built and the production increased. The First World War and revolutionary events of 1917 occurred and new problems in the mining and metallurgical branches appeared. Despite the difficult economic and political situation in the region at the beginning of the 20 th century the mining and metallurgical <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> <b>of</b> the Dnipro region of Ukraine developed more rapidly and left the branches in other regions of the Russian empire behind...|$|R

60|$|The {{improvement}} {{may either}} consist in the cheapening of some article {{which was already}} a staple production of the country, or {{in the establishment of}} some new <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry,</b> or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all. It will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export, as being somewhat the simpler of the two.|$|E

60|$|When {{there are}} more men than there is work to be done, a sifting-out process must obtain. In every <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> the less {{efficient}} are crowded out. Being crowded out because of inefficiency, they cannot go up, but must descend, and continue to descend, until they reach their proper level, {{a place in the}} industrial fabric where they are efficient. It follows, therefore, and it is inexorable, that the least efficient must descend to the very bottom, which is the shambles wherein they perish miserably.|$|E

60|$|Let me mention another {{important}} practical {{illustration of the}} value of biological study. Within the last forty years the theory of agriculture has been revolutionised. The researches of Liebig, and those of our own Lawes and Gilbert, have had a bearing upon that <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> the importance of which cannot be over-estimated; but the whole of these new views have grown out of the better explanation of certain processes which go on in plants; and which, of course, form a part of the subject-matter of Biology.|$|E
6000|$|We have so long {{looked upon}} New Jersey as {{prominent}} among what were called the [...] "free States" [...] of the Union, {{that it now}} seems strange when we consider, that among {{the first of the}} institutions established upon its soil by the early settlers, was the system of slavery. This was the case not only in New Jersey, but in all the American Colonies. The settlers of New England, {{as well as those of}} the Southern Colonies, used negro slaves as laborers on their farms; and the trade in native Africans was a very important <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E

If one <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> is in want of hands, who can [...] answer for it that, in the confusion created by universal [...] competition, another is not overstocked? And if, out of [...] thirty-four millions of men, twenty are really reduced to theft [...] for a living, this would suffice to condemn the principle.|$|E

60|$|Up to this time, Mr Pancks had transacted {{little or}} no {{business}} at his quarters in Pentonville, except in the sleeping line; {{but now that he}} had become a fortune-teller, he was often closeted after midnight with Mr Rugg in his little front-parlour office, and even after those untimely hours, burnt tallow in his bed-room. Though his duties as his proprietor's grubber were in no wise lessened; and though that service bore no greater resemblance to a bed of roses than was to be discovered in its many thorns; some new <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> made a constant demand upon him. When he cast off the Patriarch at night, it was only to take an anonymous craft in tow, and labour away afresh in other waters.|$|E
60|$|Most {{of us are}} {{familiar}} with the sumac-bush, which grows nearly all over the United States. Of course we do not mean the poisonous swamp-sumac, but that which grows along the fences and on the edges of the woods. Of late years the leaves of this bush have been greatly in demand for tanning purposes, and, in some States, especially in Virginia, sumac gathering has become a very important <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry,</b> particularly with the negroes; many of whom, during the sumac season, prefer gathering these leaves to doing any other kind of work. The sumac-bush is quite low, and the leaves are easily stripped off. They are then carefully dried, and packed in bags, and carried to the nearest place of sale, generally a country store.|$|E
60|$|The {{production}} of silk {{has been for}} centuries an important <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> in Southern France, and in the year 1853 it had attained such a magnitude that the annual produce of the French sericulture was estimated to amount to a tenth of that of the whole world, and represented a money- value of 117,000,000 francs, or nearly five millions sterling. What may be the sum which would represent the money-value of all the industries connected with the working up of the raw silk thus produced, is more than I can pretend to estimate. Suffice it to say, that the city of Lyons is built upon French silk as much as Manchester was upon American cotton before the civil war.|$|E
