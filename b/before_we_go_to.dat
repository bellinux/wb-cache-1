6000|$|... "'Here, Pharaoh, {{do you and}} Jim-Jim {{get some}} more wood <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep, else the cats will be purring round you before morning.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll know {{everything}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed, Dick," [...] answered his brother. [...] "I don't believe Uncle Randolph would telegraph unless {{the news was}} good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All this {{occurred}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the East. I had supposed those anti-renters, {{as they were}} called, had been effectually put down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He seems a {{wonderful}} man," [...] said Isobel. [...] "You remember that talk {{we had at}} dinner, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> see him at the Hunters!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{died the}} night <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Canterbury?' said I. My aunt nodded. 'No one can harm him now,' she said. 'It was a vain threat.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} would have been better to have sent a letter," [...] {{suggested}} Sam. [...] "Let's go back and write it <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And Aunt Janet says we {{are never}} to have {{anything}} to eat <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed after this except plain bread and milk," [...] said Felix sadly.|$|E
6000|$|... "But won't {{you come}} to the house? I miss you when you come in so late that there's no time to say a word <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was some}} hours <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> sleep, he plying me with {{questions}} about my life, which seemed to interest him greatly, and I returning in kind.|$|R
60|$|So it {{was known}} even <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> hear the {{financial}} report {{that there would be}} no question of profits on the Kermesse going to the Armenians or the Russians.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, do {{what you}} please, lads," [...] put in Randolph Rover. [...] "I shall not be annoyed. We {{understand}} each other a great deal better than <b>we</b> did <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Africa, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Never {{mind that}} just now,” {{interrupted}} Dunston Porter. “Go {{and see if}} the others are safe, otherwise we’ll have to round up your live-stock <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep again.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--Miss Everdene {{wants to}} speak {{to one or two}} of us <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed. What with this trouble about the baily, and now about the girl, mis'ess is almost wild." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{everything}} ready," [...] he said. [...] "Just <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed to-night I shall swear that I hear an aeroplane. You're sure your watch {{is right to}} the second, Collins?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{bed that}} night, the {{partners}} arrived at two resolutions. Mr. Keller resolved {{to address a}} written remonstrance to my aunt. Mr. Engelman resolved to show me his garden the {{first thing in the}} morning.|$|R
60|$|We {{both said}} good-night, and <b>went</b> up <b>to</b> our {{room with a}} new object in view. By our father's advice we had {{resolved}} on keeping diaries, {{for the first time}} in our lives, and had pledged ourselves <b>to</b> begin <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, {{though not}} to any great extent. We saw {{something}} {{of it in}} the papers, I remember, just <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Russia; and I recollect you mentioned it as a discreditable affair to the State, though likely to lead to no very important result." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay--you mean nullus, nulla, nullum. Even we sailors know that; {{as we all}} go {{to school}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sea. But, Sir Wycherly, in efforts to make himself understood, called you a 'half-blood.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Trust a {{woman to}} have the best of it,' muttered Merton admiringly. 'And now, Clancy, may I offer a hasty luncheon to you and your friends <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Lord's? Your {{business}} has been rather rapidly despatched.' ...|$|E
60|$|Trice. Away, away;--I'll {{tell you}} the story between the courses. Go you to the cook immediately, sirrah; and bring me word {{what we have to}} supper, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> dinner: I love to have the {{satisfaction}} of the day before me. [Exeunt.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{reads the}} stars," [...] she answered, [...] "to learn {{how long we}} have been asleep. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> sleep he made two {{pictures}} of them, as they were then and {{as they should be}} at the time he had set for our awakening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In fact," [...] said Clowes, getting up, [...] "as {{was only}} to be expected, the school started going to the dogs {{directly}} I left. We shall have to be pushing on now, Allardyce. We promised to look in on Seymour <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed. Friend let us away." ...|$|R
60|$|That night <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed I narrated to Lord Ragnall all {{the history}} of our search for the Holy Flower, which he seemed to find very entertaining. Also I told him of my adventures, to me far more terrible, as {{chairman}} of the Bona Fide Gold Mine and of their melancholy end.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay, child, art worthy to {{be called}} friend by such a lady as this? If so, I shall deem my little Alice grown a woman indeed, as it is time she were--Diccon Nevil is bent on the wedding <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the wars again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Cox. [...] "If {{you must}} give up hunting, {{do it at}} the end of the season, not at the beginning. There's a time for all things. Ring the bell, Dormouse, and we'll have another bottle of claret <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> dummy." ...|$|E
6000|$|I didn't pay any {{attention}} to this, and after going to the window and looking out at the Gaelic moon, which was about half full and rolling along among the clouds, I turned to Jone and said, [...] "Jone, let's sing 'Scots wha ha',' <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In My Game Your Game Campese writes that, [...] "It was not {{a memorable}} month or two, {{and later in the}} year I had to drop out of a major Wallaby tour for the one and only time in my career, when an x-ray of my ankle <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Argentina {{revealed}} the bone had cracked in half." ...|$|R
6000|$|Expecting to see {{us again}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Taloo, the {{planters}} wished us a pleasant journey; and, on parting, very generously presented us with a pound or two of what sailors call [...] "plug" [...] tobacco; telling us to cut it up into small change; the Virginian weed being the principal circulating medium on the island.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> on <b>to</b> Theorem 2, we need {{to define}} a few {{definitions}} and lemmas: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll be out er sight, Seth; that's {{all there}} is to it!" [...] Then, realizing how his brother news-venders might be surprised, he added, [...] "Come on quick, an' let's tell as many fellers as we can <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> see Bill Dean ship Sam Barney to Philadelphy!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well." [...] The boy's voice sank to {{the level}} of his disappointment; but after a silent {{interval}} he caught it up again cheerily. [...] "Oh, well, I reckon Benny won't care much. We'll go right back home. We can have a piece <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And we {{will send}} the baby {{down the last}} day <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Ryde, with Preston and Butts {{to take care of}} her. We can't spare him to take them down, till we shut up the house. It is so much easier for us to go to Portsmouth from hence." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> on <b>to</b> Theorem 3, we need {{to define}} a couple {{important}} terms first: ...|$|R
60|$|Here we had quilts laid very commodiously {{for me and}} {{my three}} comrades, and we lodged very comfortably; but, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> rest, <b>we</b> had the third tent <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to,</b> in which there was a very {{handsome}} table, covered with a cold treat of roasted mutton and beef, very well dressed, some potted or baked venison, with pickles, conserves, and fine sweetmeats of various sorts.|$|R
60|$|<b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> down <b>to</b> dinner, I asked Uncle Chipperton how his lung {{had stood}} it, {{through all this}} exposure.|$|R
