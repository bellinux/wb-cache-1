25|$|The energy {{consumption}} {{growth in the}} G20 slowed down to 2% in 2011, after the strong increase of 2010. The economic crisis is largely responsible for this slow growth.

25|$|Reynaud's reforms proved remarkably successful; {{a massive}} {{austerity}} program was implemented (although armament measures were not cut) and France's coffers expanded from 37 billion francs in September 1938 to 48 billion francs at {{the outbreak of}} war a year later. More importantly, France's industrial productivity jumped from 76 to 100 (base=1929) from October 1938 to May 1939. At the outbreak of war, however, Reynaud was not <b>bullish</b> on France's economy; {{he felt that the}} massive increase in spending that a war entailed would stamp out France's recovery.|$|E

This new version of the Brass released two albums in 1974 and 1975 and toured. Alpert reconvened a third version of the Brass in 1984, after being invited to perform for the Olympic Games athletes at the Los Angeles Summer Games. The invitation led to the <b>Bullish</b> album and tour.|$|E
25|$|The gloom {{increased}} during tea {{and play}} was delayed {{regardless of the}} vocal protests of the 32,000 strong crowd, with some being arrested {{as they tried to}} invade the ground. When play resumed Amiss and Cowdrey – his 114th and final Test – came out to open. They stayed out long enough for Amiss to be out lbw to a Lillee swinger for his third successive duck and stumps were drawn at 15/1. In the morning Walker had Cowdrey caught behind off a ball that bounced surprisingly, but Lillee pulled up with a trapped nerve in his foot and was unable to play {{for the rest of the}} Test. With their two strike bowlers removed and the damp spot drying out Australia struggled and Denness and Edrich took full advantage, taking the score from 18/2 to 167/3 with a third wicket stand of 149 and overtaking the home side's total with ease. There were some difficult chances off the England captain, but it was the otherwise impeccable Edrich who was out for 70 edging Walker to Ian Chappell at first slip. The vice-captain was replaced by Keith Fletcher who had suffered so much in the series with Denness, but now proved that they were attractive batsmen when not faced by blistering pace and England were 273/3 by the end of the day. Walker bowled manfully and Mallett tried to stop the flow of runs, but when Walters and Chappell were brought on for long spells the game was up. Denness was almost run out on 94 and bought up his hundred with a leg-glance that just missed Marsh's gloves, but rode his luck well. He was only the fourth England captain to make a Test hundred in Australia after Andrew Stoddart's 173 in 1894–95, Archie MacLaren's 116 in 1901–02 and Peter May's 113 in 1958–59. When Walker finally had him out caught and bowled the next day he had made 188 in 492 minutes with 17 fours, still the highest Test century by an England captain in Australia. Denness and Fletcher had added 192 for the fourth wicket took take the score to 359/4, the first time England had passed 300 in the series. Fletcher made his first Ashes century in 333 minutes with only seven fours, though he and Greig added 100 runs in 71 minutes as the big South African started thumping the tired bowlers around the deserted ground. By tea the third new ball had been seen off and England were 496/4, a lead of 344. Discussion of when Denness would declare were rendered null and void when the <b>bullish</b> Walker ran through the England batting as the tourists lost 6 wickets for 33 runs after tea. The tall Tasmanian had already taken 3/131, but produced a spell of 5/12 as Greig was caught off a mistimed drive for 89 off 94 balls, followed later in the over by Fletcher for 146. Old was bowled by a shooter from Dymock, who bowled just as long and as well, but with no luck. Alan Knott and Geoff Arnold were caught behind glancing the ball and Underwood was bowled to dismiss England for 529, only their second score over 500 in Australia since Bodyline in 1932–33. Walker returned to the pavilion with figures of 8/143 off 42.2 overs, his best analysis in Tests.|$|E
500|$|On April 2, 2012 AFA Foods, a ground-beef {{processor}} {{manufacturer of}} finely textured beef owned by Yucaipa Companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy citing [...] "ongoing media attention" [...] that has [...] "dramatically reduced {{the demand for}} all ground beef products". On April 3, 2012, U.S. cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were at a 3.5-month low, which was partially attributed to the [...] "pink slime" [...] controversy. Livestock traders stated that: [...] "It has put a dent in demand. It is <b>bullish</b> for live cattle over the long-term, but short-term it is certainly negative".|$|E
500|$|With the <b>bullish</b> {{stock market}} of the 1990s, equity-heavy {{investing}} approaches outperformed risk parity {{in the near}} term. However, after the March 2000 crash, there was an increased interest in risk parity, first among institutional investors in the United States and then in Europe. USA investors include the Wisconsin State Investment Board and the Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System (PSERS) which have invested hundreds of millions in the risk parity funds of AQR, BlackRock and Bridgewater Associates. [...] The financial crisis of 2007-2010 was also hard on equity-heavy and Yale Model portfolios, but risk parity funds fared reasonably well.|$|E
500|$|United had {{won four}} of the first five editions of the newly-branded league, and were on course to {{continue}} their domination after opening up a sizeable lead in February 1998. Injuries and poor results however destabilised the team, {{and by the time}} Arsenal visited Old Trafford in March, a title race was looking probable. Wenger was <b>bullish</b> of his team's chances: [...] "I told you last week that the race was not over when the bookmakers stopped betting. Surprise, surprise, they have started taking money again." [...] A goal from Marc Overmars set Arsenal on the way to victory, which put them six points behind with three games in hand. They eventually won the league, and secured the double by beating Newcastle United in the Cup final.|$|E
500|$|Although Gay {{had been}} <b>bullish</b> in victory on the track, the {{achievement}} {{did not change}} him—he remained humble and appreciative to his rivals. In November he {{was chosen as the}} IAAF Male World Athlete of the Year for 2007 and in his acceptance speech he paid tribute to his peers, encouraging Powell to remain focused and saying that he highly regarded the Jamaican. He also dismissed comparisons to his forebears, commenting: [...] "I honestly believe that I need to have the World record like some of the other great sprinters like Carl Lewis, Maurice Greene. I think that sets you apart, having medals and having the World record." [...] At {{the end of the season}} Gay was elected 2007 Men's Athlete of the Year by Track and Field News (topping the year's list as the fastest 100m and 200m sprinter), and he won the USATF's Harrison Dillard award as the top US male sprinter.|$|E
500|$|The 1956 final was {{the second}} time that Birmingham had reached the showpiece match, having lost 2–1 to West Bromwich Albion in 1931. Manchester City were {{appearing}} in the final for the sixth time, and for the second consecutive year. They had won the cup twice previously (in 1904 and 1934), and had been beaten in the final three times (in 1926, 1933 and 1955). Though Birmingham had less pedigree in the competition, the press viewed them as favourites. The Daily Telegraph contrasted Birmingham's [...] "dazzling Cup run" [...] with the manner in which Manchester City [...] "scraped through", describing the Midlanders as [...] "firm favourites". Interviews with players were typically <b>bullish</b> in tone. Manchester City's Bobby Johnstone opined that [...] "Even an unbiased fan must regard Manchester City with favour", whereas Birmingham's Len Boyd gauged opinion quite differently: [...] "They say Birmingham City are the hottest Cup favourites since Wolves crashed to Portsmouth in 1939".|$|E
500|$|IGN has {{featured}} Leon on {{the list}} of things {{they would like to see}} in Resident Evil 6, calling him one of the two main characters of the series along with Chris Redfield, and describing him in the article about the best zombie fighters as the [...] "straight-laced hero" [...] of Resident Evil. The IGN character guide made another comparison between Chris and Leon, calling the latter the [...] "determined guy clawing his way up the ladder". Gameplanet's Aylon Herbet wrote that if both Leon and Chris would share starring roles in a Resident Evil game it would be [...] "awesome", believing both of them to be the main protagonists of the series. In 2010, GameDaily predicted that Leon, along with Claire Redfield, would be the protagonist of the next main Resident Evil title, citing the series' pattern of alternating protagonists and Leon's last such appearance in Resident Evil 4. In 2013, GamesRadar staff included Leon among the 30 best characters in the three decades of Capcom's history, stating that [...] "he’s been battling Chris Redfield for the top spot as resident Resident Evil lead, but to us there’s no contest between the cool, fashionable Leon and the <b>bullish</b> Chris." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{performing}} {{aspect of the}} game, the team were faced with the difficulty of finding voice actors and actresses who could both act and sing. Voice actor Ryōhei Kimura was given the role of Itsuki, which he played so Itsuki would lack a strong personality as he was essentially the player's avatar. Actress and singer Inori Minase voiced Tsubasa; Minase played Tsubasa as the opposite of her normal persona, and encountered difficulties portraying her as [...] "normal". Touma was voiced by actor Yūki Ono, who called the role [...] "straight and refreshing". Ono also sang Touma's theme [...] "Jump! Ōga!". Kiria's actress Yoshino Nanjō strove to portray her character in a [...] "cool" [...] way without her coming off as cold, reflecting the character's inner softness. Nanjō found recording the songs strenuous as she was unused to character-based singles. Nanjō's performance of Kiria's song [...] "Reincarnation" [...] needed to be redone around ten times until it fitted properly with the character's personality. Ayane Sakura voices Eleanora, who despite being nervous {{made an effort to}} portray the character in a <b>bullish</b> yet clumsy way, pushing to balance her forward manner with making her appealing for players. Kaori Fukuhara, the actress for Mamori, portrayed her role so the character would sound childlike without being overly childish in her manner and tone.|$|E
500|$|Simon Price from The Independent {{said that}} the tour [...] "is a triumph of hydraulics, bungee rope {{acrobatics}} and cutting-edge choreography." [...] However, {{he felt that the}} setlist consisting of mainly current songs implied that Madonna was doing [...] "a paranoid attempt to frame herself as part of the present and not the past? The irony here is that, given the ever-decreasing spirals of pop revivalism, in order to be truly contemporary, rather than eschewing her past, Madonna would need to be ripping herself off circa 1984." [...] John McAlley from Entertainment Weekly commented that the music was [...] "loud, energetic, well-sung, and perhaps a little too often beside the point" [...] and that [...] " [...] struggle to rise above its [...] theatrics." [...] He added that one will be [...] "awed by Madonna's palpable life force and intelligence. [...] There are plenty of reasons to bow at this artist's feat." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times said that [...] "through the concert, Madonna made a display of arrogance, tossing off profanities, striking tough postures and glaring more often than she smiled. She represents self-love backed by plenty of gym time and a whole troupe of devoted flunkies, all laboring to delight an audience she only seems to disdain. Music makes the people come together, she sang in the finale– together, that is, if Madonna is clearly in charge." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian felt that [...] "with its perfect dance routines, special effects, devoted audience and hint of <b>bullish</b> arrogance, the Drowned World show befits the world's most famous woman." ...|$|E
500|$|Ferguson's {{target of}} {{achieving}} an unassailable {{lead in the}} Premiership was coming into fruition. United managed to gain 22 points {{out of a possible}} 33 over the winter, in spite of the absence of first team regulars. Such a massive gap between themselves and the chasing pack with ten games remaining was enough for Manchester bookmaker Fred Done to pay out on punters who backed the champions in retaining their crown. Within several hours, £17,000 had been snapped up, irrespective if a late challenger had emerged. Drawing away to AS Monaco gave them a slender but crucial outcome but a shock defeat at the hands of Sheffield Wednesday prevented them from opening up a 14-point advantage. The league leaders' dismal run continued; Paul Scholes scored his first goal in over four months to salvage a point at Upton Park. On the same night, Arsenal sealed a 1–0 win against Wimbledon to close the gap on United and set up a frantic contest between the top two on the Saturday. A late surge from the Gunners also reopened betting for the Premiership title race, much to the delight of Arsène Wenger. Leading up to the potential championship decider, Ferguson was adamant that a win would just about seal this title. After numerous attempts to break the deadlock in the match, Arsenal finally managed to score with 15 minutes left; Marc Overmars latched onto an Anelka header coming from a long ball and used his agility to flick it beyond the goalkeeper to give Arsenal the all important lead and win. Peter Schmeichel, who was in agony in the closing stages was ruled out for the Monaco encounter on Wednesday with a hamstring injury. When asked which team was in the best position going into the finishing straight of the season, Wenger admitted to the press that United had a [...] "small advantage" [...] over the rest. Ferguson, however was <b>bullish</b> with his side's downturn and warned that it would be [...] "inevitable" [...] for Arsenal to lose points.|$|E
500|$|Ty Burr of the Boston Globe {{gave the}} film a perfect four star rating, {{describing}} it as [...] "ridiculously satisfying", and the [...] "best prequel ever". Burr praised the character {{development in the}} film, opining that [...] "emotionally, Star Trek hits every one of its marks, functioning as a family reunion that extends across decades, entertainment mediums, even blurring the line between audience and show." [...] He continued: [...] "Trading on affections sustained over 40 years of popular culture, Star Trek does what a franchise reboot rarely does. It reminds us why we loved these characters in the first place." [...] Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an 'A-' grade, commenting that director Abrams [...] "crafts an origin story that avoids any hint of the origin doldrums." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, who gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars. He felt that the acting from the cast was {{the highlight of the}} filming, asserting that the performance of Pine radiated star quality. Likewise, Travers called Quinto's performance [...] "sharp" [...] and [...] "intuitive", and felt that Quinto [...] "gave the film a soul". Manohla Dargis of the New York Times wrote, [...] "Star Trek [...] isn’t just a pleasurable rethink of your geek uncle's favorite science-fiction series. It's also a testament to television's power as mythmaker, as a source for some of the fundamental stories we tell about ourselves, who we are and where we came from. Slate Dana Stevens felt that the film was [...] "a gift {{to those of us who}} loved the original series, that brainy, wonky, idealistic body of work that aired to almost no commercial success between 1966–69 and has since become a science fiction archetype and object of cult adoration." [...] Time Out London Tom Huddleston praised the aesthetic qualities of the film, such as the design of Enterprise, and praised the performances of the cast. He wrote, [...] "The cast are equally strong: Quinto brings wry charm to an otherwise calculating character, while Pine powers through his performance in <b>bullish,</b> if not quite Shatner-esque fashion." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kurzweil {{believes}} {{these large}} scale simulations are valuable, but says a more explicit [...] "functional algorithmic model" [...] {{will be required}} to achieve human levels of intelligence. Kurzweil is unimpressed with neural networks and their potential while he's very <b>bullish</b> on vector quantization, hidden Markov models and genetic algorithms since he used all three successfully in his speech recognition work. Kurzweil equates pattern recognizers in the neocortex with statements in the LISP programming language, which is also hierarchical. He also says his approach is similar to Jeff Hawkins' hierarchical temporal memory, although he feels the hierarchical hidden Markov models have an advantage in pattern detection.|$|E
2500|$|The matches {{themselves}} were characterised by poor crowds (half empty grounds) and lacklustre performances by the World XI. Former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott described the series as a [...] "bunfight" [...] {{and said that}} there was [...] "nothing that resembled cricket" [...] in it. [...] The authoritative publication The Wisden Cricketer summed up the Test match as follows: [...] " [...] was a terrible game of cricket. It had a small crowd, little meaning and was forgotten quickly." [...] The World XI players seemed to be there more for fun than anything else. Andrew Flintoff came up with some refreshingly honest statements amidst all the <b>bullish</b> officials: [...] "I've got the Super Series in two weeks' time. I can't think of anything worse," [...] he said, adding on arrival; [...] "I'm only here for the food." ...|$|E
2500|$|England lost Atherton early, caught behind off Hughes, but Lathwell and Smith added 89 {{to erase}} the deficit. [...] A {{collapse}} looked likely when Warne switched from the Radcliffe Road End, where he had looked fairly tame, to the Pavilion End where he immediately found turn and bounce and had both established batsmen out in quick succession, Smith caught behind and Lathwell adjudged lbw. [...] Stewart followed shortly after, leaving England 117/4 and in real danger of throwing the match away. [...] Caddick came in as nightwatchman and shepherded Gooch to the close, which proved a vital stage of the innings. [...] Gooch came out the next morning in <b>bullish</b> mood and took the attack to the tourists, bludgeoning 120 and adding 150 with Graham Thorpe (114*), {{who went on to}} complete his maiden Test century on the fifth morning, adding a further 113 with Hussain before Gooch called for the declaration.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1918 the U.S. First Army {{had been}} formed, first under Pershing's direct command {{and then by}} Lieutenant General Hunter Liggett, when the U.S. Second Army under Lieutenant General Robert Bullard was created. After a quick victory at Saint-Mihiel, east of Verdun, {{some of the more}} <b>bullish</b> AEF commanders had hoped to push on eastwards to Metz, but this did not fit in with the plans of the Allied Supreme Commander, Marshal Foch, for three {{simultaneous}} offensives into the [...] "bulge" [...] of the Western Front (the other two being the Fourth Army's breach of the Hindenburg Line and an Anglo-Belgian offensive, led by Plumer's Second Army, in Flanders). Instead, the AEF was required to redeploy and, aided by French tanks, launched a major offensive northwards in very difficult terrain at Meuse-Argonne. Initially enjoying numerical odds of eight to one, this offensive eventually engaged 35 or 40 of the 190 or so German divisions on the Western Front, although to put this in perspective, around half the German divisions were engaged on the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) sector at the time.|$|E
2500|$|On taking office, Hoover {{said that}} [...] "given {{the chance to}} go forward with the {{policies}} of the last eight years, we shall soon with the help of God, be in sight of the day when poverty will be banished from this nation." [...] Having seen the fruits of prosperity brought by technological progress, many shared Hoover's optimism, and the already <b>bullish</b> stock market climbed even higher on Hoover's accession. But within months of taking office, the Stock Market Crash of 1929 (also known as Black Tuesday) occurred, and the worldwide economy began to spiral downward into the Great Depression. The causes of the Great Depression remain a matter of debate, but Hoover viewed a lack of confidence in the financial system as the fundamental economic problem facing the nation. He sought to avoid direct federal intervention, believing {{that the best way to}} bolster the economy was through the strengthening of businesses such as banks and railroads. He also feared that allowing individuals on the [...] "dole" [...] would permanently weaken the country. Instead, Hoover strongly believed that local governments and private giving should address the needs of individuals. A reserved man with a fear of public speaking, Hoover allowed his political enemies to define him as cold, incompetent, reactionary, and out-of-touch.|$|E
2500|$|For his audition, Paesano {{created a}} demo which {{included}} a simple piano motif. Though this material would usually {{not be used in}} the final score, in this instance Paesano took the motif and converted it into a main theme for the series, which becomes the theme for Daredevil in the show. The final theme was co-composed by Braden Kimball. The first episode ends with a montage that the editors originally temped with a song, but DeKnight wanted to use original music instead. Paesano subsequently wrote a more [...] "songish" [...] version of the main theme for the sequence, with a basic verse-chorus-verse structure, and instrumentation such as guitars and a drum kit to retain the feel and energy of the originally chosen song. Besides the main theme, Paesano tended to focus more on [...] "a feel and a tone and a sound" [...] rather than Star Wars-style motifs and [...] "heavy, thematic, melodic elements". The approach for villain Wilson Fisk was to juxtapose [...] "this big <b>bullish</b> threatening character" [...] with [...] "light and sparse and elegant" [...] classical music. For when his [...] "evil twisted side" [...] shows through, Paesano [...] "took classical pieces of music and I twisted them up and played them backwards or redid some of the harmony or put them through distortion and created a classical vibe but really mangled and twisted". For Stick, Paesano used a cello bow on the neck of the cello, a technique called col legno, to replicate the sound of the blind man's cane. Paesano described his [...] "themes" [...] for Punisher and Elektra in the second season as [...] "angry" [...] and [...] "mystical" [...] sounding, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Later, in {{the week}} of episodes from 27 to 31 August, a fight breaks out {{involving}} the remaining suspects. Kat is seen tending to her lover's injuries, but viewers only saw his arm. Inisde Soap said the arm could eliminate at least one suspect, as it shows some skin and a dark top. They compared it to what the suspects were wearing earlier in the episode and said it could belong to Michael or Derek, but [...] "EastEnders might have a few tricks up their sleeves {{in order to put}} Jack and Max back in the mix." [...] When Kat receives flowers from her lover, Inside Soap opined that Derek would be [...] "the sort of <b>bullish</b> man [...] think nothing of sending flowers to , unconcerned that it might expose the affair." [...] After Kat confesses to Alfie, she concentrates on her marriage, but Inside Soap noted that over a period of weeks, she had been seen [...] "drunkenly flirting with Max, [...] making small talk with Jack [...] and giving Derek some very guilty looks", though it was still not clear who was her lover. They said that Jack had become devoted to Sharon in that time and is bothered by the bond Sharon has with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), but the bold gestures made towards Kat, such has her lover buying back the ring she pawned, are Derek's style, and [...] "he's made no secret {{of the fact that he}} fancies Kat rotten!"
