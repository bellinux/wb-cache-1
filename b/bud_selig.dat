5|$|The Brewers {{were members}} of the American League until 1997, when Commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> offered the team the option to switch leagues due to a {{realignment}} of Major League Baseball's divisions. The Brewers have been members of the National League since 1998.|$|E
5|$|April 15, 2007, was the 60th {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut, with ceremonies held at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California. During the 2007 regular season, Ken Griffey, Jr. called <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> {{to ask for}} {{permission}} to wear number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day. Griffey received special permission from Rachel Robinson to wear number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day of 2007.|$|E
5|$|The first Jackie Robinson Day was on April 15, 2004. That {{day was a}} {{start to}} an annual {{tradition}} throughout Major League Baseball and an inspirational reminder about what happened on that day exactly fifty-seven years earlier when Jackie Robinson became a Major League Baseball player. The day {{would be the first}} official league-wide Jackie Robinson Day, having festivities taking place at all 23 ballparks where Major League games were scheduled to be played. Baseball Commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> made the announcement with Sharon Robinson (daughter of Rachel and Jackie Robinson).|$|E
50|$|Hershel Martin was former MLB {{commissioner}} <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig's</b> favorite player as a youngster.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, in {{response}} to Selig's controversial decision to end the MLB All-Star Game in a 7-7 tie, the Saints gave out neckties (or [...] "ties") with <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig's</b> image.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Alderson {{had been}} working as {{commissioner}} <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig’s</b> point man to address {{the issues of the}} corruption of baseball in the Dominican Republic, the largest supplier of Major League Baseball talent outside the United States.|$|R
5|$|In January 1999, President Bill Clinton eased travel {{restrictions}} and increased cultural exchange between the United States and Cuba, leading Angelos to again seek permission {{to play an}} exhibition game in Cuba. Angelos met with Sandy Berger, Clinton's National Security Advisor, to discuss a potential exhibition. <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig,</b> the MLB Commissioner, allowed for {{the exploration of the}} series, though it still required the approval of MLB owners and the MLBPA. The MLBPA insisted on a second game to be held in the United States. A contingent of United States Representatives, including Ros-Lehtinen, Robert Menendez, Dan Burton, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, and Rick Lazio, lobbied Fehr to try to block the series.|$|E
5|$|West umpired in {{his second}} NLDS (and fifth LDS) in 2011. The next year West was the first base umpire for Félix Hernández's August 15 perfect game against the Tampa Bay Rays. He umpired another NLDS that year, then {{appeared}} in his fifth World Series. His career has spanned the tenure of baseball commissioners Bowie Kuhn, Peter Ueberroth, Bart Giamatti, Fay Vincent, <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> and Rob Manfred. The 2015 season was West's 38th in MLB, making him MLB's most senior umpire. Umpire Bruce Froemming, who was previously the most senior umpire, spent 37 seasons in MLB, retiring {{at the end of}} the 2007 season.|$|E
5|$|April 15, 2005, was the 58th {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Baseball Commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> officially {{declared}} that every April 15 would be designated as Jackie Robinson Day {{and it would}} be celebrated each year throughout Major League Baseball. Every ballpark in Major League Baseball in the United States celebrated Jackie Robinson Day, unlike in 2004 when it was only celebrated in 13 ballparks. Each ballpark showed a video tribute to Robinson, and many brought out Jackie Robinson Foundation scholars onto the field before the games. In Cincinnati, Ohio, Ken Griffey, Jr. spoke of how much every African-American baseball player owes Robinson, who was chosen by manager Branch Rickey to break the color line because of Robinson's inner courage and ability to keep his temper in check.|$|E
50|$|DuPuy left MLB in {{the fall}} of 2010 after 8½ years as the commissioner's top aide. During his twelve years at MLB, he led the {{formation}} of Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which includes MLB's website. He agreed to commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig's</b> request that he continue to work on various MLB special projects.|$|R
25|$|In 2013, {{in keeping}} with Commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig's</b> desire for {{expanded}} interleague play, the Houston Astros were shifted from the National to the American League; with an odd number (15) in each league, an interleague contest was played somewhere almost every day during the season. At this time the divisions within each league were shuffled to create six equal divisions of five teams.|$|R
50|$|To {{demonstrate}} {{there still}} was support for big-league ball in Milwaukee, <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig's</b> group contracted with Chicago White Sox owner Arthur Allyn to host nine White Sox home games at Milwaukee County Stadium in 1968. A 1967 exhibition {{game between the}} White Sox and Minnesota Twins had attracted more than 51,000 spectators, and Selig was convinced the strong Milwaukee fan base would demonstrate the city would provide a good home for a new club.|$|R
5|$|Earlier in {{the season}} Commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> {{expressed}} interest in scheduling a World Series game during daylight hours instead of the evening. The starting times were ultimately moved before 8p.m. ET {{for the first time}} in 30 years, but no day games were played. The Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL) played across the street from Citizens Bank Park at Lincoln Financial Field on the day of Game4. The NFL moved that game's kickoff time to 1p.m. to avoid it ending too close to the start of Game4. Similarly, Game5 was played at Citizens Bank Park on the same day as the Philadelphia Flyers hosted the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL) at the Wachovia Center. The opening faceoff of the hockey game was scheduled for 7p.m. but the NHL moved it to 5p.m. to avoid conflict.|$|E
5|$|The commissioner, <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig,</b> {{was not in}} {{attendance}} in this game but was represented by the Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations, Jimmie Lee Solomon. Selig called Bonds later that night to congratulate him on breaking the record. President George W. Bush also called Bonds {{the next day to}} congratulate him. On August 24, San Francisco honored and celebrated Bonds's career accomplishments and breaking the home run record with a large rally in Justin Herman Plaza. The rally included video messages from Lou Brock, Ernie Banks, Ozzie Smith, Joe Montana, Wayne Gretzky and Michael Jordan. Speeches were made by Willie Mays, Giants teammates Omar Vizquel and Rich Aurilia, and Giants owner Peter Magowan. Mayor Gavin Newsom presented Bonds the key to the City and County of San Francisco and Giants vice president Larry Baer gave Bonds the home plate he touched after hitting his 756th career home run.|$|E
5|$|The {{incorrect}} call {{led many}} baseball writers {{to call for}} {{the increased use of}} instant replay in baseball, which was used only to review disputed boundaries on home runs during the 2010 season. Many journalists also advocated for MLB commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> to overturn Joyce's call and award a perfect game to Galarraga. On June 3, Selig announced that Major League Baseball would look at expanded replay and umpiring, but he did not specifically address Joyce's call. A baseball official familiar with the decision confirmed to The Associated Press that the call was not being reversed. For his efforts in this game, Galarraga was named the American League Player of the Week on June 7. Also, first base, a ball used in the game, and Galarraga's spikes were sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E
5000|$|Following his {{retirement}} as a player, Lopes coached first {{base for the}} Baltimore Orioles from 1992 to 1994 and the San Diego Padres from 1995 to 1999. Lopes was hired as the Milwaukee Brewers manager in 2000 following <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig's</b> recommendation to hire a manager with a minority background. [...] Tired of the Brewers' continued poor performance and Lopes' media and field antics, club management fired him as manager fifteen games into the 2002 season. He was 144-195 in 3 seasons with the Brewers.|$|R
500|$|Former SportsCenter co-host Keith Olbermann {{dedicated}} {{a special}} edition of the [...] "Worst Person in the World" [...] segment of his political commentary show Countdown to lambasting <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig's</b> refusal to reverse Joyce's call. While Olbermann ordinarily lists three [...] "Worsts", Selig alone was awarded the title because [...] "there can only be one Worst Person tonight". Olbermann went on to cite Lee MacPhail's handling of George Brett's 1983 Pine Tar Incident {{as an example of a}} commissioner overruling an umpire's call, and discussed the matter with both Governor Granholm and documentarian Ken Burns.|$|R
5000|$|Kreiter {{began her}} career working at {{stations}} in LaCrosse, Wisconsin and Green Bay, Wisconsin. [...] During her tenure at ESPN, Kreiter {{was a reporter}} for SportsCenter and NFL Countdown. She worked here since 2000. She may be best known for reporting from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on the days following the September 11, 2001 attacks. She covered Major League Baseball commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig's</b> decision to suspend play as the nation mourned. Kreiter produces for WTTW-11, the PBS affiliate in Chicago, Illinois. She also spent two years with Fox Sports Net in Chicago.|$|R
5|$|As an {{exception}} to the retired-number policy, MLB began honoring Robinson by allowing players to wear number 42 on April 15, Jackie Robinson Day, which is an annual observance that started in 2004. For the 60th anniversary of Robinson's major league debut, MLB invited players to wear the number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day in 2007. The gesture was originally the idea of outfielder Ken Griffey, Jr., who sought Rachel Robinson's permission to wear the number. After receiving her permission, Commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> not only allowed Griffey to wear the number, but also extended an invitation to all major league teams to do the same. Ultimately, more than 200 players wore number 42, including the entire rosters of the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, and Pittsburgh Pirates. The tribute was continued in 2008, when, during games on April 15, all members of the Mets, Cardinals, Washington Nationals, and Tampa Bay Rays wore Robinson's number 42. On June 25, 2008, MLB installed a new plaque for Robinson at the Baseball Hall of Fame commemorating his off-the-field impact on the game as well as his playing statistics. In 2009, all uniformed personnel (players, managers, coaches, and umpires) wore number 42 on April 15.|$|E
5|$|The final {{incident}} occurred in 1998, when Alfonso Soriano {{was unable to}} leave the Hiroshima Toyo Carp due to contract restrictions. Soriano disliked the intense Japanese practice schedule, and the Carp denied him a salary increase from $45,000 (the league's minimum) to $180,000 per year. Like Nomo and Irabu, Soriano hired Nomura to help his situation. After first attempting to void Soriano's NPB contract by unsuccessfully arguing that the player was legally a minor when he signed it Nomura advised him, like Nomo, to retire from NPB and pursue a career in MLB. This prompted Carp executives to file an injunction against Soriano and send letters to MLB teams demanding that they cease all negotiations with him. NPB officials claimed that after the Nomo case they had privately amended the Player Contract to give NPB teams the right to prohibit a player from signing a new contract anywhere after voluntarily retiring. Since MLB officials were not consulted {{and they did not}} agree to any changes, MLB Commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> declared that MLB would recognize Soriano as a free agent on July 13, 1998, and the Carp backed down. He signed a 5-year, $3.1million contract with the New York Yankees the same year.|$|E
25|$|In May 2015, the Milwaukee Brewers honored <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> {{with the}} {{unveiling}} of the Selig Experience exhibit at Miller Park. The Selig Experience is a fifteen-minute documentary showing Bud Selig's life and work for the Milwaukee Brewers.|$|E
5000|$|In August 2012, Commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig's</b> [...] "blue ribbon" [...] committee, {{which had}} been {{implemented}} to study potential ballpark locations for the Athletics, met with Oakland and San Jose officials. At the Oakland meeting, the committee was met with {{a proposal for a}} ballpark on the site of Howard Terminal, a container terminal on the Oakland waterfront near Jack London Square currently owned by the Port of Oakland. Lew Wolff stated the site [...] "has no ability to be implemented for a ballpark.". Major League Baseball, however, has stated that it is their preferred location for a new ballpark in Oakland.|$|R
50|$|On June 16, 2009, The New York Times {{reported}} that Sosa supposedly {{was on a}} list of players who tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs in 2003. The paper did not identify the drug nor the source of the information. Sosa's agent, Adam Katz, told The Associated Press he had no comment on the report. Rich Levin, commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig's</b> office spokesman, {{declined to comment on the}} situation, claiming that MLB did not have a copy of the test results. Michael Weiner, the union general counsel, also declined comment. The union, while fighting to get the list back from the government, has mostly refused to discuss reports. Likewise, Sosa never admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs nor did he ever fail an MLB drug test throughout his professional career.|$|R

25|$|This World Series {{was marked}} by a {{controversy}} involving the Minute Maid Park roof. MLB & Commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> insisted that the Astros must play with the roof open which mitigated the intensity and enthusiasm of the cheering Astros fans.|$|E
25|$|On September 5, 2014, <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> {{presented}} him with the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award. He was the 14th recipient and (after Rachel Robinson) second non-player to receive the award, which was created to recognize accomplishments and contributions of historical significance to the game of baseball.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Feeney {{was one of}} {{the lawmakers}} who opposed a demand by <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> that the state finance a new {{baseball}} stadium for the Florida Marlins. At that time, Selig had threatened that the Marlins might leave South Florida if they did not receive a tax break.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Boras used {{an obscure}} {{provision}} in the major league rules to have draft picks Matt White (seventh overall pick, San Francisco Giants) and Bobby Seay (12th overall pick, Chicago White Sox) declared free agents. White and Seay both then signed with the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays, with White receiving a $10.2 million contract and Seay receiving a $3 million bonus, significantly more than {{what they would have}} received via the draft process. The following year, Major League Baseball changed its rules in response to Boras's success in circumventing the draft, which had resulted in at least $25 million in extra money for his clients. For many years, being [...] "outsmarted" [...] by Boras and losing Seay remained a sore spot for White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, one of Commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig's</b> closest allies.|$|R
25|$|Pappas wrote prolifically about {{baseball}} economics, analyzing and debunking what he perceived as false information spread by Major League Baseball and sympathetic media outlets. He railed against claims by Commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> that the league's teams were in dire financial straits, using the league's own data to refute the claims.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Rose {{applied for}} reinstatement. Fay Vincent, who as deputy {{commissioner}} {{had played a}} key role in negotiating the agreement banning Rose before becoming commissioner after Giamatti's death, never acted on Rose's application. In September 1998, Rose applied for reinstatement with Vincent's successor <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig,</b> but Selig also never acted on it.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the Red Sox {{were sold}} by Yawkey trustee and {{president}} Harrington to a consortium called New England Sports Ventures headed by principal owner John Henry. The group underbid the next highest bidder, James L. Dolan, {{in a complex}} deal arranged by consortium part-owner George Mitchell and MLB commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig.</b>|$|E
25|$|On March 30, 2006, <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> {{launched}} an investigation on the alleged steroid use by {{players such as}} Barry Bonds and Gary Sheffield as the weight of books like Game of Shadows emerged. The inquiry into steroids' use in baseball {{is expected to go}} back no further than 2002, when the MLB started testing players for performance-enhancing drugs.|$|E
25|$|MLB Commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> briefly {{considered}} {{whether or}} not to punish Rodriguez for his admitted steroid use, citing the illegality of the situation, among other things. However, {{at the time of the}} testing there were no punishments for this sort of activity. Additionally, his admission to three years of steroid use could be damaging to his image and legacy.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneously, the Twins {{assembled}} a 130-member advisory group, dubbed Minnesotans for Major League Baseball, which met to discuss possible stadium alternatives. Their deliberations included {{a meeting with}} <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig,</b> commissioner of baseball, to discuss economic issues within the sport. Their final report did not recommend a site (and did not even mention Rapid Park), but did provide advice to the team on how to proceed in winning public approval for any plan.|$|E
25|$|Commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> {{imposed a}} very strict anti-drug policy upon its minor league players, {{who are not}} part of the Major League Baseball Players Association (the PA). Random drug testing, {{education}} and treatment, and strict penalties for those caught were the rule of law. Anyone on a Major League team's forty man roster, including 15 minor leaguers that are on that list, were exempt from that program. Some called Selig's move a public relations stunt, or window dressing.|$|E
25|$|The 2002 All-Star Game, held in Milwaukee, {{ended in}} {{controversy}} in the 11th inning when both teams ran out of substitute players available to pitch in relief. At that point, Commissioner <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> (a Milwaukee native and former owner of the Brewers) declared that the game would end after 11 innings, and it ended in a 7–7 tie. The crowd booed and threw beer bottles onto the field, and the media were highly critical of this unsatisfactory conclusion.|$|E
