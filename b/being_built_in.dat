5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and {{only on a}} very small scale. Brachiopods seldom settle on {{artificial}} surfaces, probably because they are vulnerable to pollution.

5|$|Greer Stadium, {{once one}} of the best stadiums in Triple-A baseball, began to be out shined by newer {{state-of-the-art}} ballparks <b>being</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> the late 1980s. The Reds let their player development contract (PDC) with the Sounds expire so they could place their Triple-A affiliate in Indianapolis, which was closer to Cincinnati and was planning to build a new stadium.

5|$|Historically, {{the main}} port {{on the river}} was at Bridgwater, where a span crossed the river from 1200 AD onwards. Quays were built at Bridgwater in 1424, with another quay, the Langport slip, <b>being</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> 1488 {{upstream}} of the Town Bridge. A custom house was sited at Bridgwater, on West Quay, and a dry dock, launching slips and a boat yard on East Quay. Bridgwater built some 167 ships, the last one being the Irene launched in 1907.|$|E
5|$|Inertial {{confinement}} fusionis one of {{two major}} lines of fusion power development, the other being magnetic confinement fusion (MCF), notably the tokamak concept which is <b>being</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> a major experimental system known as ITER. Magnetic confinement is widely {{considered to be the}} superior approach, and has seen significantly greater development activity over the decades. However, there are serious concerns that the MCF approach of ITER cannot ever become economically practical.|$|E

5|$|The Second World War devastated {{much of the}} East End, {{with its}} docks, {{railways}} and industry forming a continual target for bombing, especially during the Blitz, leading to dispersal of the population to new suburbs and new housing <b>being</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> the 1950s. Many East Enders went further than the eastern suburbs, leaving London altogether, notably to the Essex new towns of Basildon and Harlow {{and a number of}} expanded towns in south Essex and elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopods {{live only in}} the sea, {{and most}} species avoid {{locations}} with strong currents or waves. The larvae of articulate species settle in quickly and form dense populations in well-defined areas while the larvae of inarticulate species swim {{for up to a}} month and have wide ranges. Brachiopods now live mainly in cold water and low light. Fish and crustaceans seem to find brachiopod flesh distasteful and seldom attack them. Among brachiopods, only the lingulids (Lingula sp.) have been fished commercially, on a very small scale. One brachiopod species (Coptothyrus adamsi) may be a measure of environmental conditions around an oil terminal <b>being</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> Russia on the shore of the Sea of Japan.|$|E
5|$|Farming has {{traditionally}} been the basis of Cardiganshire's economy, with dairying and stock-rearing being the main occupations. Before the first railway was built in 1866, the stock used to be herded over the mountains to England, where Rugby, Northampton and London were important destinations. At one {{time there was a}} sizeable mining industry in Cardiganshire, but the reserves of lead, silver and zinc became unprofitable to mine by {{the early part of the}} twentieth century. Shipping was also important in the county, with coal and lime being imported in coastal vessels, and mineral ores and oak bark for tanning being exported. Shipbuilding was an important industry with most of Wales' sailing vessels <b>being</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> Cardiganshire.|$|E

5|$|Feth-i Bülend {{was ordered}} in 1867 from the Thames Iron Works, Blackwall Yard in London and was {{laid down in}} May 1868. She was {{launched}} in 1869 and began sea trials in 1870, being commissioned into the Ottoman Navy later that year. Upon completion, Feth-i Bülend and the other ironclads then <b>being</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> Britain and France were sent to Crete to assist in stabilizing the island {{in the aftermath of}} the Cretan Revolt of 18661869. During this period, the Ottoman fleet, under Hobart Pasha, remained largely inactive, with training confined to reading translated British instruction manuals.|$|E
5|$|Organ {{music was}} seldom {{written in the}} Classical era, as composers {{preferred}} the piano with its ability to create dynamics. In Germany, the six sonatas op. 65 of Felix Mendelssohn (published 1845) {{marked the beginning of}} a renewed interest in composing for the organ. Inspired by the newly built Cavaillé-Coll organs, the French organist-composers César Franck, Alexandre Guilmant and Charles-Marie Widor led organ music into the symphonic realm. The development of symphonic organ music continued with Louis Vierne and Charles Tournemire. Widor and Vierne wrote large-scale, multi-movement works called organ symphonies that exploited the full possibilities of the symphonic organ. Max Reger and Sigfrid Karg-Elert's symphonic works made use of the abilities of the large Romantic organs <b>being</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> Germany at the time.|$|E
5|$|RML ordered Magdalena in 1946. Her keel {{had been}} laid by 8 October when Harland and Wolff applied for a {{passenger}} certificate for the ship. In 1947 {{it was reported that}} delivery would be delayed until the end of 1948 and that the cost of building her would be considerably higher than the estimated cost when the order was placed. She was built to replace , which had been sunk in 1940. Magdalena was the first passenger ship built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast {{after the end of the}} war and the third-largest <b>being</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom at that time.|$|E

50|$|There was {{a trench}} dug here {{sometime}} in the 17th or early 18th century, as a defence structure. Most of it was filled up in 1875 when the main line railroad (Västra Stambanan) was <b>built</b> <b>in</b> Sweden. The area was again <b>being</b> <b>built</b> upon <b>in</b> the 1970s, when the highway was built.|$|R

5|$|The {{ship was}} based on the {{incomplete}} hull of the Italian passenger ship Ausonia, which was <b>being</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> Hamburg. The conversion was proposed by the Air Department of the Reichs Navy Office, but it was abandoned after negotiations within the German Navy over a proposed moratorium on new ships {{at the end of the}} war. After World War I ended, high inflation in Germany added to the cost of the ship, and as a result, the Italian shipping company for whom the ship was originally built, declined to purchase her. The vessel was therefore sold to shipbreakers and dismantled in 1922.|$|E
5|$|When {{the third}} statehouse was {{condemned}} in 1876 the government abandoned the building. The General Assembly relocated {{to a large}} office building that had been built in 1865 and was already housing the Supreme Court. The Governor and the executive staff relocated to another office building. The office building {{was used as the}} statehouse during the interim period that the new statehouse was <b>being</b> <b>built.</b> <b>In</b> 1887, before the new statehouse had been completed, enough of the lower floors were usable for the government {{to move out of the}} cramped office space and begin holding sessions in the new structure.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{from the}} outset, {{overcrowding}} {{has been a}} constant problem, and there have been numerous improvements to the facilities and below-ground arrangements to deal with this. After much discussion between the then two separate operators, a major reconstruction began in 1912. This entailed a new ticket hall, serving both lines, <b>being</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> the basement of the Bakerloo station, with the Bakerloo lifts removed and new deep-level escalators opened down to the Bakerloo line level. Access to the CLR was by way of existing deep-level subways. The new works came into use on 9 May 1914 with the CLR lifts still available for passengers. By 1923 even this rearrangement was unable to cope, so a second rebuilding began. This involved a second set of escalators being built directly down to the Central line and the CLR station building becoming exit-only. On 2 October 1928, a third escalator leading to the Bakerloo platforms was opened. Unusually, lifts came back into prominence at an Underground station when, in 1942, a set of high-speed lifts came into use, largely used as an exit route from the Central line platforms directly to the Argyll Street exit building.|$|E
