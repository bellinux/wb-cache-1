5|$|Stews {{are basic}} fare {{for every day}} family cooking and are always served with {{vermicelli}} rice or plain rice. They are popular <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> {{a wide range of}} nutrients from the meat, the vegetables and the rice. The extra liquid is also essential in such dry climate. Stews are also economically beneficial, as they provide relatively small amount of meat into feeding large families, especially within the poorer population.|$|E
5|$|Silviculture is the {{practice}} of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests, which are areas that have a high density of trees. Cultivated trees are planted and tended by humans, usually <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> food (fruits or nuts), ornamental beauty, or some type of wood product that benefits people. An area of land planted with fruit or nut trees is an orchard. A small wooded area, usually with no undergrowth, is called a grove and a small wood or thicket of trees and bushes is called a coppice or copse. A large area of land covered with trees and undergrowth is called woodland or forest. An area of woodland composed primarily of trees established by planting or artificial seeding {{is known as a}} plantation.|$|E
5|$|The park's woods are {{important}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> shelter {{for a large}} number of animals. They are a natural defence against landslides, avalanches, and flooding. The two main types of woods found in the park are coniferous and deciduous woods. The deciduous European beech forests are common on the Piedmont side of the park, and are not found on the dryer Valle d'Aosta side. These forests are thick with dense foliage that lets in very little light during the summer. The beech leaves {{take a long time to}} decompose, and they form a thick layer on the woodland floor that impedes the development of other plants and trees. Larches are the most common trees in the forests on the valley floors. They are mixed with spruces, Swiss stone pines, and more rarely silver firs.|$|E
50|$|During the {{downturn}} of the Canadian dollar beginning in 2015, alternative methods {{to the big}} banks for currency exchange became popular <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> lower fees compared to big banks.|$|R
50|$|In general, however, critics {{often see}} Kay Tracey as simply {{one of a}} number of girls' series that are {{important}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> girl readers with role models, particularly girls who grew up before third-wave feminism.|$|R
50|$|The land {{surrounding}} a bay often reduces {{the strength of}} winds and blocks waves. Bays were significant {{in the history of}} human settlement <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> a safe place for fishing. Later they were important in the development of sea trade as the safe anchorage <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> encouraged their selection as ports.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that women choose less-paying occupations <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> flexibility to better manage work and family.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} via counit–unit adjunction {{is convenient}} for proofs about functors which {{are known to}} be adjoint, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> formulas that can be directly manipulated.|$|E
25|$|Peridotite is the {{dominant}} rock of {{the upper part of}} the Earth's mantle. The compositions of peridotite nodules found in certain basalts and diamond pipes (kimberlites) are of special interest, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> samples of the Earth's mantle brought up from depths ranging from about 30km to 200km or more. Some of the nodules preserve isotope ratios of osmium and other elements that record processes that occurred when the earth was formed, and so they are of special interest to paleogeologists <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> clues to the early composition of the Earth's mantle and the complexities of the processes that occurred.|$|E
50|$|The {{church was}} founded in 1865 by Rev. Fealand Quarles. It was {{reestablished}} in 1985 by Rev. Jimmy R. Bosley. It is named after the Ogburn family <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> money and support to build the church. The current pastor is Rev. Lewis C. Thompson.|$|R
5000|$|... (1985) Rules supplement. Many authors: Stephen R. Marsh, Stephen Perrin, Ian Lee Starcher, Anthony Affronti, Jimmy Akin II, William A Barton, Norman Doege, Bruce Dresselhaus, Ray Greer, Zoran Kovacich, George MacDonald, Steve Maurer, Sandy Petersen, Wayne Shaw, John Sullivan—most {{are listed}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> {{one or more}} {{optional}} rules.|$|R
50|$|Ion {{weapons are}} also popular, presumably <b>because</b> <b>they</b> do <b>provide</b> sound and recoil unlike lasers.|$|R
25|$|Today, skyscrapers are an {{increasingly}} common sight where land is expensive, {{as in the}} centers of big cities, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> such a high ratio of rentable floor space per unit area of land.|$|E
25|$|Solid-core – Can {{consist of}} low-density {{particle}} board or foam used to completely fill the space within the door. Solid-core flush doors (especially foam-core ones) {{are commonly used}} as exterior doors <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> more insulation and strength.|$|E
25|$|For alert, {{cooperative}} patients, air breaks {{provided by}} mask {{are more effective}} than changing the chamber gas <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> a quicker gas change and a more reliable gas composition both during the break and treatment periods.|$|E
50|$|The New Laws {{were not}} well {{received}} by the conquistadors <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> that what was effectively Indian slavery had to end, that everyone had to pay {{a fair share of}} taxes, and that all the encomienda rights {{had to go to the}} king. The conquistadors would have nothing of this.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} gives {{insight on}} the ancient practices of the Greeks and Romans. Their history, playwrights, and architecture have affected our society in positive ways. We have structures that have similarities to the Greeks and Romans’ architectures that are important for theatre practitioners <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> techniques which helped develop modern day structures...|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1934, Associated Oil Company {{commissioned}} {{a series of}} photographs {{to be taken to}} record the progress of construction on the Golden Gate Bridge and San-Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge projects. The projects were of special interest to the Associated Oil Company <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> Flying A Gasoline and Cycol Motor Oil almost entirely for the projects.|$|R
25|$|Besides lossy {{compression}} methods, lossless formats {{are a significant}} alternative to MP3 <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> unaltered audio content, though with an increased file size compared to {{lossy compression}}. Lossless formats include FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec), Apple Lossless and many others.|$|E
25|$|The Ten Commandments {{are written}} with room for varying interpretation, {{reflecting}} {{their role as}} a summary of fundamental principles. They are not as explicit or detailed as rules or many other biblical laws and commandments, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> guiding principles that apply universally, across changing circumstances. They do not specify punishments for their violation. Their precise import must be worked out in each separate situation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> 30 {{molecules}} of ATP per glucose molecule {{in contrast to}} the 2 ATP molecules produced by glycolysis, mitochondria are essential to all higher organisms for sustaining life. The mitochondrial diseases are genetic disorders carried in mitochondrial DNA, or nuclear DNA coding for mitochondrial components. Slight problems with any one of the numerous enzymes used by the mitochondria can be devastating to the cell, and in turn, to the organism.|$|E
50|$|In the Acre humans {{lived in}} {{relative}} freedom <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> services that the Vorra {{could not provide}} for themselves. Chief among those services was the maintenance and repair of machines brought from Earth for the Vorra to use. But the Terrans also provided certain chemical services and Shaw {{had been sent to}} obtain one of those.|$|R
50|$|The {{reason for}} intensifying sex-selection {{abortion}} in China and India {{can be seen}} through history and cultural background. Generally, before the information era, male babies were preferred <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> manual labor and continuation of the family lineage. Labor is still important in developing nations as China and India, {{but when it comes}} to family lineage, it is of great importance.|$|R
50|$|The store {{typically}} accepts scrip or non-cash vouchers {{issued by}} the company in advance of weekly cash paychecks, and gives credit to employees before payday. Except in very remote areas, company stores became scarcer after the miners bought automobiles and could travel {{to a range of}} stores. Even so, the stores could survive <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> convenience and easy credit.|$|R
25|$|Boots {{and wraps}} are worn by almost all horses, {{due to the}} fact that they may easily injure their legs when landing or when making tight turns at speed. Open-fronted tendon boots usually are worn on the forelegs, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> {{protection}} for the delicate tendons that run down the back of the leg, but still allow the horse to feel a rail should it get careless and hang its legs. Fetlock boots are sometimes seen on the rear legs, primarily to prevent the horse from hitting itself on tight turns.|$|E
25|$|MMT proponents such as Warren Mosler {{argue that}} trade deficits {{need not be}} {{unsustainable}} and are beneficial to {{the standard of living}} in the short run. Imports are an economic benefit to the importing nation <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> the nation with real goods it can consume, that it otherwise would not have had. Exports, on the other hand, are an economic cost to the exporting nation because it is losing real goods that it could have consumed. Currency transferred to foreign ownership, however represents a future claim over goods of that nation.|$|E
25|$|Larger {{trees are}} more likely to support more Orthalicus reses reses snails than smaller trees, {{probably}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> the snails with an increased surface area for foraging. It is not known if Orthalicus reses reses prefer certain tree types or species; however, Voss (1976) suggested tree snails generally prefer trees with smooth bark rather than trees with rough bark, because it would require less energy to crawl over smooth bark. Voss also believed Orthalicus reses reses would prefer smooth bark because it {{would make it easier for}} them to form a secure mucous seal when they were aestivating, resulting in lower mortalities from dehydration or accidental dislodgement.|$|E
50|$|Emotions {{have been}} {{described}} as discrete and consistent responses to internal or external events which have a particular significance for the organism. Emotions are brief in duration and consist of a coordinated set of responses, which may include physiological, behavioural, and neural mechanisms. Emotions have also been described as the result of evolution <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> good solutions to ancient and recurring problems that faced ancestors.|$|R
50|$|Human-induced changes {{caused by}} nearly 1,000 years of continual {{sandstone}} quarrying have also contributed {{in parts of}} the sandstone highlands to the appearance of the landscape today. The fissures (called Loose by the quarrymen) played an important role here, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> in effect natural divisions in the rock that were helpful when demolishing a rock face or when dressing the rough blocks of stone.|$|R
50|$|Harris also {{discusses}} the cow as a sacred animal and taboo food in Hindu culture. Unlike the Middle Eastern civilizations, India had developed very productive forms of agriculture, requiring heavy labor. The high population densities and the periodic droughts rendered animal husbandry for food purposes impractical, and slowly {{led to the}} ending of animal sacrifice. Cattle remained an important species <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> farm labor.|$|R
25|$|Political {{activism}} by youth can {{go unnoticed}} because youth activism often occurs on school grounds {{and away from}} the adult society, but youth often face resistance when forming youth activist groups in schools. As the central beneficiaries of public schools, youth are also advocating for student-led school change and education reform through student activism and meaningful student involvement. There are structural inequalities that keep youth from engaging in political talk and action on school grounds or the public domain. School clubs require an adult adviser to make the club official, further adding to school hierarchies of adult power. While some youth participate in student government, others prefer student unions <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> a real voice to the students and present it to the administration while student governments do not have the power to effect real change in a school system.|$|E
25|$|In the past, simple {{game theory}} models, {{such as the}} classic {{cooperative}} hunting and Prisoner's dilemma models, {{were used to determine}} decisions made by animals in cooperative relationships. However, complicated interactions between animals have required the use of more complex economic models such as the Nash equilibrium. The Nash equilibrium is a type of non-cooperative game theory that assumes an individual's decision is influenced by its knowledge of the strategies of other individuals. This theory was novel because it took into consideration the higher cognitive capabilities of animals. The evolutionarily stable strategy is a refined version of the Nash equilibrium in that it assumes strategies are heritable and are subject to natural selection. Economic models are useful for analyzing cooperative relationships <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> predictions on how individuals act when cooperation is an option. Economic models are not perfect, but they provide a general idea of how cooperative relationships work.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Feynman acceded {{to a request}} to [...] "spruce up" [...] the {{teaching}} of undergraduates at Caltech. After three years devoted to the task, he produced a series of lectures that eventually became The Feynman Lectures on Physics. He wanted {{a picture of a}} drumhead sprinkled with powder to show the modes of vibration {{at the beginning of the}} book. Concerned over the connections to drugs and rock and roll that could be made from the image, the publishers changed the cover to plain red, though they included a picture of him playing drums in the foreword. The Feynman Lectures on Physics occupied two physicists, Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands, as part-time co-authors for several years. Even though the books were not adopted by universities as textbooks, they continue to sell well <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> a deep understanding of physics. Many of his lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books, including The Character of Physical Law, , Statistical Mechanics, Lectures on Gravitation, and the Feynman Lectures on Computation.|$|E
5000|$|Most spammers {{violate the}} bill <b>because</b> <b>they</b> don't <b>provide</b> their email {{addresses}}, real names, addresses {{and phone numbers}} {{in the beginning of}} their messages.|$|R
2500|$|The Cheka {{were popular}} staples in Soviet film and literature. This was {{partly due to}} a romanticization of the {{organisation}} in the post-Stalin period, and also <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> a useful action/detection template. Films featuring the Cheka include Ostern's Miles of Fire, Nikita Mikhalkov's [...] At Home among Strangers, the miniseries The Adjutant of His Excellency, and also Dead Season (starring Donatas Banionis), and the 1992 Russian drama film The Chekist.|$|R
5000|$|Rabbi Eleazar {{explained}} that Jochebed's choice of bulrushes - a cheap material - for the ark (as reported in [...] ) demonstrated that righteous people's money is dearer {{to them than}} their bodies, so {{that they should not}} be driven to steal. Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani {{explained that}} she chose bulrushes for the ark <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> a soft material that could withstand encounters with soft and hard materials alike.|$|R
