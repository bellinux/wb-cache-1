40|$|The fine {{spectral}} {{structures of}} solar radio type-I bursts were observed by the solar radio telescope AMATERAS. The spectral characteristics, {{such as the}} peak flux, duration, and bandwidth, of the individual <b>burst</b> <b>elements</b> were satisfactorily detected by the highly resolved spectral data of AMATEAS with the burst detection algorithm that is improved in this study. The peak flux of the type-I bursts followed a power-law distribution with a spectral index of 2. 9 - 3. 3, whereas their duration and bandwidth were distributed more exponentially. There were almost no correlations between the peak flux, duration, and bandwidth. That means there were no similarity shapes in the burst spectral structures. We defined {{the growth rate of}} a burst as the ratio between its peak flux and duration. There was a strong correlation between the growth rate and peak flux. These results suggest that the free energy of type-I bursts that is originally generated by non-thermal electrons is modulated in the subsequent stages of the generation of non-thermal electrons, such as plasma wave generation, radio wave emissions, and propagation. The variation of the time scale of the growth rate is significantly larger than that of the coronal environments. These results {{can be explained by the}} situation that the source region may have the inhomogeneity of an ambient plasma environment, such as the boundary of open and closed field lines, and the superposition of entire emitted bursts was observed by the spectrometer.

Since excess oxidants can cause tissue damage and oxidative stress, phagocytes must precisely control both the location and timing of NADPH oxidase activity. How differential regulation is achieved at phagosomes is not well understood. Recent studies have revealed that the PI(3) P phosphoinositide {{plays an important role}} in locally boosting phagosomal NADPH oxidase activity through its binding to the p 40 (phox) NADPH oxidase subunit.

The bottleneck delayed formation of any helium-4 until the universe became cool enough to form deuterium (at about a temperature equivalent to 100 keV).

The deuterium bottleneck in the formation of helium, together with the lack of stable ways for helium to combine with hydrogen or with itself (there are no stable nuclei with mass numbers of five or eight) meant that an insignificant amount of carbon, or any elements heavier than carbon, formed in the Big Bang. These elements thus required formation in stars. At the same time, the failure of much nucleogenesis during the Big Bang ensured that there would be plenty of hydrogen in the later universe available to form long-lived stars, such as our Sun.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a regularized sampling method for multiband signals, {{that makes it}} possible to approach the Landau limit, while keeping the sensitivity to noise at a low level. The method is based on band-limited windowing, followed by trigonometric approximation in consecutive time intervals. The key point is that the trigonometric approximation "inherits" the multiband property, that is, its coefficients are formed by <b>bursts</b> of non-zero <b>elements</b> corresponding to the multiband components. It is shown that this method can be well combined with the recently proposed synchronous multi-rate sampling (SMRS) scheme, given that the resulting linear system is sparse and formed by ones and zeroes. The proposed method allows one to trade sampling efficiency for noise sensitivity, and is specially well suited for bounded signals with unbounded energy like those in communications, navigation, audio systems, etc. Besides, it is also applicable to finite energy signals and periodic band-limited signals (trigonometric polynomials). The paper includes a subspace method for blindly estimating the support of the multiband signal as well as its components, and the results are validated through several numerical examples.

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} mode of a multi-gene {{family can}} change over time, {{depending on the}} functional differentiation and local genomic environment of family members. In this study, we demonstrate such {{a change in the}} melanoma antigen (MAGE) gene family on the mammalian X chromosome. The MAGE gene family is composed of ten subfamilies that can be categorized into two types. Type I genes are of relatively recent origin, and they encode epitopes for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in cancer cells. Type II genes are relatively ancient and some of their products are known to be involved in apoptosis or cell proliferation. The evolutionary history of the MAGE gene family can be divided into four phases. In phase I, a single-copy state of an ancestral gene and the evolutionarily conserved mode had lasted until the emergence of eutherian mammals. In phase II, eight subfamily ancestors, with the exception for MAGE-C and MAGE-D subfamilies, were formed via retrotransposition independently. This would coincide with a transposition <b>burst</b> of LINE <b>elements</b> at the eutherian radiation. However, MAGE-C was generated by gene duplication of MAGE-A. Phase III is characterized by extensive gene duplication within each subfamily and in particular the formation of palindromes in the MAGE-A subfamily, which occurred in an ancestor of the Catarrhini. Phase IV is characterized by the decay of a palindrome in most Catarrhini, with the exception of humans. Although the palindrome is truncated by frequent deletions in apes and Old World monkeys, it is retained in humans. Here, we argue that this human-specific retention stems from negative selection acting on MAGE-A gene...|$|R
40|$|Dynamics of {{bacterial}} insertion sequences: can transposition <b>bursts</b> help the <b>elements</b> persist? Yue Wu 1, 2, 3, Richard Z. Aandahl 1, 2 and Mark M. Tanaka 1, 2 * Background: Currently {{there is no}} satisfactory explanation for why bacterial insertion sequences (ISs) widely occur across prokaryotes despite being mostly harmful to their host genomes. Rates of horizontal gene transfer {{are likely to be}} too low to maintain ISs within a population. IS-induced beneficial mutations may be important for both prevalence of ISs and microbial adaptation to changing environments but may be too rare to sustain IS elements in the long run. Environmental stress can induce elevated rates of IS transposition activities; such episodes are known as ‘transposition bursts’. By examining how selective forces and transposition events interact to influence IS dynamics, this study asks whether transposition bursts can lead to IS persistence. Results: We show through a simulation model that ISs are gradually eliminated from a population even if IS transpositions occasionally cause advantageous mutations. With beneficial mutations, transposition bursts create variation in IS copy numbers and improve cell fitness on average. However, these benefits are not usually sufficient to overcome the negative selection against the <b>elements,</b> and transposition <b>bursts</b> amplify the mean fitness effect which, if negative, simply accelerates the extinction of ISs. If down regulation of transposition occurs, IS extinctions are reduced while ISs still generate variation amongst bacterial genomes. Conclusions: Transposition bursts do not help ISs persist in a bacterial population in the long run because most burst-induced mutations are deleterious and therefore not favoured by natural selection. However, bursts do create more genetic variation through which occasional advantageous mutations can help organisms adapt. Regulation of IS transposition bursts and stronger positive selection of the elements interact to slow down the burst-induced extinction of ISs...|$|R
40|$|TPCK (tosylphenylalanylchloromethane), first {{discovered}} as a serine protease inhibitor, {{has been described}} to affect in diverse systems a number of physiological events probably unrelated to its antiprotease effect, such as proliferation, apoptosis and tumour formation. In the present study, we focus on its inhibition of the neutrophil respiratory <b>burst,</b> an important <b>element</b> of non-specific immunological defence. The superoxide anion-producing enzyme, NADPH oxidase, is quiescent in resting cells. Upon cell stimulation, the redox component, membrane-bound flavocytochrome b 558, is activated when the cytosolic factors (p 47 phox, p 67 phox and p 40 phox, {{as well as the}} small GTPase Rac) associate with it after translocating to the membrane. This requires the phosphorylation of several p 47 phox serine residues. The signal transduction events leading to enzyme activation are not completely understood. In the past, the use of diverse protease inhibitors suggested that proteases were involved in NADPH oxidase activation. We suggested previously that TPCK could prevent enzyme activation by the phorbol ester PMA, not due to inhibition of a protease, but possibly to inhibition of the cytosolic factor translocation [Chollet-Przednowed and Lederer (1993) Eur. J. Biochem. 218, 83 – 93]. In the present work, we show that TPCK, when added to cells before PMA, prevents p 47 phox phosphorylation and hence its translocation; moreover, when PMA-stimulated cells are incubated with TPCK, p 47 phox is dephosphorylated and dissociates from the membrane. These results are in line with previous suggestions that the respiratory burst {{is the result of a}} series of continuous phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. They suggest that TPCK leads indirectly to activation of a phosphatase or inactivation of a kinase, and provide the first clue towards understanding the steps leading to its inhibition of NADPH oxidase activation...|$|R

The {{study of the}} cooling of neutron stars has been undertaken by many researchers in the past twenty-five years, but this study has been made difficult by the inherent theoretical and observational uncertainties; most observations of their thermal X-ray flux have yielded only upper limits. More sensitive satellites such as ROSAT and AXAF may provide more positive flux information, {{and it is important}} to know how to interpret these data in terms of surface temperature. One of the most important factors in this interpretation is the effect of the surface magnetic field. Young neutron stars are believed to have extremely strong magnetic fields, on the order of 10 (12) G. These fields dominate the physics of the atmosphere. In particular, atoms in the atmospheres of neutron stars have much greater binding energies than in the zero-field case, and they are constrained to move along the field lines. We use a multiconfigurational Hartree-Fock code, modified for very strong magnetic fields, to calculate wavefunctions, energies and oscillator strengths for several atoms in representative values of the magnetic field. We then use these simulations to construct model atmospheres for neutron stars. Because of the low mass necessary for optical depth unity in the soft X-rays (typically [ [...] . ]) and because of the short time scale for gravitational separation (~ 1 - 100 s), the photosphere is likely to consist of a pure element. Numerous processes could cause many elements to be important, so we investigate atmospheres consisting of pure hydrogen, helium, carbon, nitrogen and silicon in magnetic fields of 9. 4 x 10 (11) G, 2. 35 x 10 (12) G, and 4. 7 x 10 (12) G. We also use the high-field energies to investigate soft X-ray lines in gamma-ray <b>bursts.</b> Highly ionized <b>elements</b> could create absorption lines in the 1 - 15 keV range, and the identification of such lines in conjunction with cyclotron lines would determine the magnetic field and gravitational redshift on the surface of the star, which would provide clues to the equation of state on the interior.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the tube hydroforming process is conducted {{in order to understand}} the effect of pre-bending operation on formability in tube hydroforming and assess the application of the newly developed Extended Stress-Based Forming Limit Curve (XSFLC) method to the prediction of failure in tube hydroforming. Two sets of experiments on straight tube hydroforming and pre-bent tube hydroforming were conducted on tubes manufactured from three steel grades, namely DDQ, HSLA 350 and DP 600, which represent mild steel, high strength steel and advanced high strength steel, respectively. All tubes had the same outer diameter of 76. 2 mm and the same nominal wall thickness of 1. 8 mm, which enabled direct assessment of the effect of material strength on formability in tube hydroforming. For pre-bent tube hydroforming the tubes were bent to 90 degrees before hydroforming. The effect of the increased axial compressive load, termed the end-feed load, on tube formability in hydroforming was investigated. All experiments were simulated using the explicit dynamic finite element code LS-DYNA in order to investigate the accuracy of numerical predictions in the tube hydroforming process. The numerical simulations, validated using the experimental data, were then utilized to investigate the prediction of necking in straight and pre-bent tube hydroforming using the XSFLC method. The formability, burst pressure and corner-fill expansion in hydroforming of the pre-bent tubes was considerably less than that exhibited in hydroforming of the straight tubes. In both straight and pre-bent tube hydroforming, the application of the end-feed load postponed failure and significantly increased internal pressure and corner-fill expansion at <b>burst.</b> The finite <b>element</b> models accurately predicted the results of the tube bending and tube hydroforming experiments. The straight tube hydroforming simulations, validated using the experimental results, enabled accurate prediction of the failure location and tube internal pressure at the onset of necking using the XSFLC method. In order to obtain the XSFLC for each alloy, strain-based FLCs were calibrated using the results of tube free expansion tests. The results of the tube free expansion tests and corresponding numerical simulations also served to validate the tube material properties for the FE models. Straight tube hydroforming simulations were utilized to investigate the effect of friction between the tube and the die on the hydroforming process parameters and necking predictions using the XSFLC method. The validated pre-bent tube hydroforming simulations captured the trends in the increase of tube internal pressure at the onset of necking with the increase of end-feed load using the XSFLC method...|$|R

The <b>burst</b> of any <b>element</b> {{in the chain}} brings the cables to the floor, cutting the transport of the current with important liabilities. This work reports the rupture of a galvanized U-bolt steel stirrup of a 60 kV overhead electric transport line of a Eolic Park in the North of Portugal. This component is subject to a complex load system and variable attack angles. Thus, the component is subjected to fatigue, wear, static crush and corrosion. The fractured stirrup was manufactured from a hot rolled C 1 - S 235 JRC steel rod with Ø 14. 5 mm. The final component was hot dip galvanised and centrifuged according standard ISO 1461. Fracture surface and multiple cross section microscopy and chemical analysis of the fractured stirrup {{as well as of}} new unused stirrups was carried out to identify the rupture mechanisms responsible for the collapse of the structure. Residual resistance of the broken stirrup was evaluated via dedicated designed tensile testing. The original steel has a wide number of big inclusions, same over 400 m long, developed parallel to the axis of the rod. These inclusions intercept the surface of the rod, inducing surface indentations and cracking of the galvanised coating. Also a considerable number of pronounced notches are observed at the steel surface, at the steel/zinc coating interface. The fracture surface displays two symmetrical glossy burnish areas, characteristic of the fatigue processes, separated by a central ductile central zone. In the fractured component several cracks due to inclusions are observed intercepting the fracture surface. Zinc and Oxygen were identified of all over the fatigue grown crack surface indicating that hydrolysis of the coating took place with continuous wet transport to the cracked surface with precipitation and oxidation. The analysis carried out allows concluding that the failure of the component took place by fatigue. Fracture was initiated at the 1 st/ 2 nd thread of the component, close to the screw joint. The variable load acted perpendicularly to the plane of symmetry of the component. Corrosion took place simultaneously with fatigue crack propagation speeding the failure process. The inclusions present in the steel, mainly those that intercept the component surface, as well as the surface notches due to hot rolling, enhanced the disclosure of the fatigue process leading to premature failure of the component...|$|R
40|$|Relatively {{high wing}} loading leads to {{increase}} in fuel efficiency in commercial {{as well as in}} small general aviation aircraft, but requires sophisticated high lift devices to keep the take-off and landing distances within acceptable limits. High lift devices can in turn have a detrimental effect on cruise performance, and thus fuel efficiency, in the form of additional parasitic drag of the high lift system mechanism fairings under the wing. In addition, the weight and complexity of the high lift system increases with its performance. The purpose of this research is to increase the payload of a highly efficient propeller driven 4 -seater general aviation aircraft by improving its plain flap high lift system while the range stays the same. Therefore a detailed design of the high lift system is required, as well as the evaluation of the overall aircraft performance. A study of existing high lift systems in general aviation aircraft is conducted, based on which a preliminary design decision to implement a single-slotted flap with a dropped hinge mechanism is made. An optimization loop is developed within which the flap geometry is generated based on nine design variables (including the position of the hinge point and the flap deflection angle) and the clean configuration airfoil shape. Two-dimensional aerodynamic analysis of the two-element airfoil section is performed by the MSES code at three different angles of attack. A method of reading the maximum value of displacement thickness on the flap upper surface is implemented to algorithmically detect separated flow and discard the flap designs that suffer from separation at low angles of attack in order to avoid jumps in the lift curve. Three-dimensional aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft with deployed flaps are estimated using semi-empirical methods. The drag of the mechanism fairings is also estimated by a semi-empirical method. A simple performance model is used to predict the payload, which represents the objective function of the optimization. Landing and take-off distances are also calculated using the performance equations. Matlab's genetic algorithm and pattern search algorithm are used to perform global and local optimization of the flap geometry. The resulting single-slotted flap design increase the maximum take-off weight by 13 % which results in the increase in payload of 42 %. Take-off distance increases by 12. 5 % and landing distance increases by 16. 5 %. Maximum sectional lift coefficient is improved by 27 % with respect to the original plain flap. The additional cruise drag due to mechanism fairings increases the fuel weight by 3 % for the range of 1000 nm. Limiting phenomena in achieving the highest two-dimensional lift coefficient is the <b>bursting</b> of main <b>element's</b> wake, rather than flow separation off the airfoil surface. The method of monitoring the displacement thickness of the flap wake is successful in ensuring that the optimized flap has no jumps in the lift curve.
