500|$|Sean Kinney {{said about}} the new album and the fans' mixed {{reactions}} about the band moving on after Staley's death: [...] "Look, it’s a big move to fucking stand up and move on. Some people, the music connected with them so strongly, their opinions, {{how they feel about}} it... It’s amazing that they have such a connection but they seem to act like it happened to them. This happened to us and Layne’s family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we’re okay with it, why can’t you be? This happened to us, this didn’t happen to you. But this album isn’t about that, it’s a bigger universal point. We’re all going to fucking die, we’re all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, is a victory. I already feel like I’ve won." [...] "Sometimes people ask us, ‘Wouldn’t Layne have been pissed off that we did this?’ And I tell them {{it would have been the}} opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We’re not doing this for money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> in this. And one of the reasons I’m doing this is so more light is turned on to something where the light was turned off." [...] And Cantrell added: [...] "We’ve toured around the world, we’ve lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can’t fucking replace, and then we’ve chosen by circumstance to get together again. That turned into ‘maybe we can fucking do this.’ And that turned into this".|$|E

2500|$|Stephen Sundlof, {{director}} of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, says [...] "Melamine is not very toxic as a chemical, so we're wondering why {{we are seeing the}} kinds of serious conditions, especially the kidney failure, that we're seeing in cats and dogs... We are focusing on the melamine right now <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> that, even if melamine is not the causative agent, it is somehow associated with the causative agent, so it serves as a marker". Even at the highest observed concentrations found in wheat gluten, the melamine exposure is much smaller than the rat and mouse doses for which effects were seen. Instead, the FDA has suggested a second contaminant may be responsible for the ill effects and melamine, as the most easily identifiable contaminant, may serve as a biomarker, or indicator, for contaminated wheat gluten.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2009, a {{representative}} of Usher told MTV News that the album will not be released on December 21, 2009 as scheduled: [...] "The release of Usher's next album, Raymond v. Raymond, has been delayed <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> that the album {{is so strong that}} we want to give it the opportunity to have the proper setup before coming out". The album's release was pushed back again due to Usher experiencing issues in obtaining management, following him parting ways with his then manager, Jonetta Patton, also his mother, in late November 2009. Patton had severed management ties with Usher due to his relationship with former Def Jam executive Grace Miguel, and she felt [...] "if she didn't end things when she did, it would permanently affect their personal relationship." [...] Raymond v. Raymond was ultimately released on March 30, 2010 in the United States, and released on April 26, 2010 in the United Kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|Jeanne-Claude was a {{firm believer}} in the {{aesthetic}} beauty of works of art; she said, “‘We want to create works of art of joy and beauty, which we will build <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> it will be beautiful.’” However, {{that does not mean that}} Jeanne-Claude and Christo’s artworks were without larger political connotations. Jeanne-Claude and Christo created a piece in response to the building of the Berlin Wall, in 1962. They blocked off the Rue Visconti in Paris with a wall of oil drums. The 4-meter-high wall built with oil barrels completely closed the street and blocked all communication between Rue Bonaparte and Rue de Seine. They said, [...] "This 'iron curtain' can be used as a barricade during a period of public work in the street, or to transform the street into a dead end. Finally its principle can be extended to a whole area or an entire city." [...] As the police approached, Jeanne-Claude firmly stood her ground and guarded the art piece, arguing for it to stay in place just for a few more hours.|$|E

2500|$|On November 7, 2016, Senator Leila de Lima, Duterte's chief {{government}} critic, filed a Supreme Court writ of habeas data against Duterte, {{testing the}} doctrine of presidential immunity, claiming [...] "The verbal attacks on petitioner's womanhood and threats on her person {{are not covered by}} presidential immunity from suit because they are not the official act of a President". The 20-page writ asked, [...] "Can a sitting President wage a personal vendetta against petitioner and use the resources of his powerful office to crucify her as a woman, a human being, and a duly elected senator in violation of her right to privacy in life, liberty and security?" [...] De Lima's counsel, De La Salle University College of Law dean Jose Manuel Diokno, said [...] "Immunity cannot be used to block this case.

We hope the Supreme Court will listen to the plea of Senator de Lima and give consideration to this petition <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> it is of groundbreaking importance".|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{hearing that}} {{tracking}} data on June 22, 2010, showed {{the film was}} not likely to produce revenue over $30 million in its first five days on screen, a FOX executive told TheWrap he was [...] "confounded", and commented, [...] "Tracking says one thing, but our sneak previews this weekend said something totally different. ... {{but if you look}} at the empirical data, we’re nowhere." [...] New York Magazine reported that the day prior to the film's release, a long scene from Knight and Day was made available on iTunes, in an attempt to improve the lackluster 28–31% [...] "definite interest" [...] level of the movie. After results were reported from the film's initial debut, FOX distribution executive Bruce Synder commented to The Hollywood Reporter, [...] "It's an adult movie opening on a Wednesday, but we opened it there and snuck it on Saturday <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> the word-of-mouth will be good, so we're set for a pretty good opening weekend.

[...] The result alluded to by Kwerel {{is known as the}} Linkage principle and was developed by Milgrom and Weber (1982). (Milgrom (2004) recasts the linkage principle as the 'publicity effect.') It provided a theoretical foundation for the intuition driving the major design choice by the FCC between an ascending bid and sealed bid auction.|$|R

My answer was simple: We are there in those neighborhoods because that's where people are dying.

2500|$|After the September 11 {{attacks in}} 2001, {{performances}} by the Boston Symphony Orchestra of excerpts from Klinghoffer were canceled. BSO Managing Director Mark Volpe remarked of the decision: [...] "We originally programmed the choruses from John Adams’ The Death of Klinghoffer <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> {{in it as}} a work of art, and we still hold that conviction. ... explained that it was a purely human reason, and that it wasn’t in the least bit a criticism of the work." [...] Adams and Klinghoffer librettist Alice Goodman criticized the decision, and Adams rejected a request to substitute a performance of Harmonium, saying: [...] "The reason that I asked them not to do 'Harmonium' was that I felt that 'Klinghoffer' is a serious and humane work, and it's also a work about which many people have made prejudicial judgments without even hearing it. I felt that if I said, 'OK, [...] "Klinghoffer" [...] is too hot to handle, do [...] "Harmonium,"' that in a sense I would be agreeing with the judgment about 'Klinghoffer.'" [...] In response to an article by San Francisco Chronicle David Wiegand denouncing the BSO decision, musicologist and critic Richard Taruskin accused the work of catering to [...] "anti-American, anti-Semitic and anti-bourgeois" [...] prejudices.|$|E
