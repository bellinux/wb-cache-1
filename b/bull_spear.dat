60|$|I {{had almost}} forgot another very common piece of barbarous Pleasure at these Diversions. The Tauriro will {{sometimes}} stick {{one of their}} <b>Bull</b> <b>Spears</b> fast in the Ground, aslant, but levell'd as near as he can at his Chest; then presenting himself to the Bull, just before {{the point of the}} Spear, on his taking his run at the Tauriro, which, as they assur'd me, he always does with his Eyes closed, the Tauriro slips on one side, and the poor Creature runs with a violence often to stick himself, and sometimes to break the Spear in his Chest, running away with part of it till he drop.|$|R

50|$|The {{three were}} first {{collected}} as The Chronicles of Corum (1978).The last volume {{also won the}} August Derleth Award while the first book was adapted into the 4-issue comic series Corum: The <b>Bull</b> and the <b>Spear.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Moorcock's The <b>Bull</b> and the <b>Spear</b> the {{character}} Jhary-a-Conel refers to Glogauer as an {{incarnation of the}} Eternal Champion. It is thought the unnamed Nigerian could be an incarnation of Jerry Cornelius {{or another of the}} companions to the eternal champion.|$|R
5000|$|First Comics {{published}} The Chronicles of Corum, a twelve issue limited series (Jan. 1986 - Dec. 1988) that {{adapted the}} [...] "Swords Trilogy", and {{was followed by}} the four issue limited series Corum: The <b>Bull</b> and the <b>Spear</b> (Jan. - July (bi-monthly) 1989), which adapted the first book in the second trilogy.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Moorcock wrote {{a second}} trilogy of novels, <b>Bull</b> and the <b>Spear,</b> Oak and the Ram and Sword and the Stallion about Prince Corum where he travels to a Celtic themed realm, of his world's far future, where Corum has become Cremm Croich (Cremm/Corum of the Silver Hand), The Lord of the Mound.|$|R
50|$|Purdon {{was born}} in Cathcart in the Eastern Cape of South Africa where he was raised on a cattle farm. He was educated at Kingswood College in Grahamstown where he {{represented}} the school's 1st XV for three years, captaining the team in his final year. In 2008, Purdon's final year, he featured alongside Scotland International David Denton, <b>Bulls</b> and Kubota <b>Spears</b> lock Grant Hattingh and Springbok Sevens Olympic Bronze Medalist Rosko Specman.|$|R
50|$|Also that month, he and Damian Adams {{defeated}} Pat Buck and Shad Gaspard. A week later, he lost to Intercontinental Champion Johnny Nitro at a June 28 OVW television taping. Bzibziak also wrestled Boris Alexiev, Aaron Stevens, Jamin, Mr. Stronko and Mike Kruel {{in single}} matches {{during the summer}} as well as mixed tag team matches with Serena against Chuck Evans and ODB. On July 21, he teamed with Jack <b>Bull</b> and Shawn <b>Spears</b> to beat Eddie Craven and Deuce n' Domino.|$|R
50|$|This trilogy {{consists}} of The <b>Bull</b> and the <b>Spear</b> (1973), The Oak and the Ram (1973), and The Sword and the Stallion (1974). It was titled The Prince with the Silver Hand in the United Kingdom and The Chronicles of Corum in the United States respectively. The previous trilogy hinted at a Celtic or proto-Celtic {{setting for the}} stories - the terms mabden (human beings) and shefanhow (demons) occurring in these books are both Cornish language words. The Silver Hand trilogy is more explicit in its Celtic connections, with overt borrowings from Celtic mythology.|$|R
50|$|Corum also {{hears the}} prophecy of a seeress, who claims Corum should fear a brother (who will {{apparently}} slay him), a harp and above all, beauty. Corum seeks the lost artifacts of the Tuha-na-Cremm Croich - a sacred <b>Bull,</b> a <b>spear,</b> an oak, a ram, a sword and a stallion - which will restore the land. Corum gains new allies, Goffanon (a blacksmith and diminutive giant, {{a member of}} the Sidhe race) and Goffanon's cousin and true giant Illbrec. They battle the Fhoi Myore, who themselves have allies: a returned Prince Gaynor, the wizard Calatin and his clone of Corum, the Brothers of the Pine, the undead Ghoolegh and a host of giant demonic dogs. After being instrumental in the death of two of the Fhoi Myore and restoring to his senses the enscorceled Amergin, the High King and Chief Druid of the Tuha-na-Cremm Croich, Corum and his allies fight a final battle in which all their foes are destroyed.|$|R
40|$|Both {{competition}} and herbivory {{have been shown}} to reduce plant survival, growth, and reproduction. Much less is known about whether {{competition and}} herbivory interact in determining plant performance, especially for introduced, weedy plant species in the invaded habitat. We simultaneously evaluated both the main and interactive effects of plant neighbors and insect herbivory on rosette growth and seed reproduction in the year of flowering for Cirsium vulgare (<b>bull</b> thistle, <b>spear</b> thistle), an introduced Eurasian species, in tallgrass prairie in 2 years. Effects of insect herbivory were strong and consistent in both years, causing reduced plant growth and seed production, whereas the effects of competition with established vegetation were weak. The amount of herbivore damage inflicted on rosettes did not depend on the presence of neighbor plants. We also found no interaction between competition and herbivory on key parameters of plant growth and fitness. The results of this study contradict the hypothesis that competitive context interacts with insect herbivory in limiting the invasiveness of this introduced thistle. Further, the results provide additional, experimental evidence that high levels of herbivory on established rosettes by native insects exert significant biotic resistance to the invasiveness of C. vulgare in western tallgrass prairie...|$|R
2500|$|Culturama, {{the annual}} {{cultural}} festival of Nevis, is celebrated during the Emancipation Day weekend, {{the first week}} of August. The festivities include many traditional folk dances, such as the masquerade, the Moko jumbies on stilts, Cowboys and Indians, and Plait the Ribbon, a May pole dance. The celebration was given a more organised form in 1974, including a Miss Culture Show and a Calypso Competition, as well as drama performances, old fashion Troupes (including Johnny Walkers, Giant and <b>Spear,</b> <b>Bulls,</b> Red Cross and Blue Ribbon), arts and crafts exhibitions and recipe competitions. According to the Nevis Department of Culture, the aim is to protect and encourage indigenous folklore, in order {{to make sure that the}} uniquely Caribbean culture can [...] "reassert itself and flourish".|$|R

40|$|At the start, {{the singer}} thanks {{the people who}} are present during the recording. He says, I thank you and greet you in the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Then he says his name, Manyang Deng Thuch, (his nicknames are Mabiet-jok, Waar-baak, Agut-maameer). He adds that {{everyone}} has his own song – a first song made after becoming an adult. It is usually sung during the tethering of the cows (this is what they do in their culture as a youth). At the start of the song he praises his bull mabior (white bull). He probably received this bull from the marriage of the daughter of Mabor Ajundit. Then he says: my father is well-known in this area of Majok. I stabbed a <b>bull</b> with a <b>spear.</b> It was a fat bull of my uncle. This shows that he is a powerful man (‘gentleman’). A gentleman cannot stand behind the dancing place; he should be in the middle, to be noticed by everybody. I am a man who {{can be found in the}} middle of the cattle camp. My bull is the tallest bull among the bulls. It is bright as a white-man country. It is like a sun and moon. The spirit of my father and mother bring maameer (bright bull) for me. I want to use it as dowry. It will be paid for Akur Majok’s family...|$|R
