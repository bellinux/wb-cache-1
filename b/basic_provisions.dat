25|$|Britain's forces besieged the Ottoman Empire's Mediterranean ports, {{which led}} to a lack of <b>basic</b> <b>provisions</b> and {{maintenance}} supplies needed to keep the railway working. The lack of coal rendered most steam locomotives inoperable. Attempts were made to mine coal in Lebanon, but the inferior coal there caused damage to the trains. Eventually it was decided to use charcoal, and extensive logging operations were set up by the Ottomans to keep up the demand. More extensions to the line were built as a result, for the efficient transport of wood—one from Tulkarm to the forest of Hadera, and another to the Menashe Heights on the slopes of Mount Carmel near Umm al-Fahm. As these operations went on, the number of natural forests in Palestine dwindled, and the authorities ordered the cutting down of every tenth fruit-bearing tree to support the war effort.|$|E

25|$|The {{uprising}} led to {{the death}} and imprisonment of thousands of individuals. Many of the deaths were inside the prisons, where prisoners of conscience were subjected to inhumane torture and deprived of <b>basic</b> <b>provisions,</b> such as food, water, medicine, and sanitation. From 1988 up until 2012, the military and police illegally detained and imprisoned {{tens of thousands of}} democracy leaders, as well as intellectuals, artists, students, and human rights activists. Pyone Cho, {{one of the leaders of}} the uprising, spent 20 years of his adult life in prison. Ko Ko Gyi, another leader of the uprising, spent 18 years of his life in prison. Min Ko Naing was placed in solitary confinement for nine years for his role as a leader of the uprising. Because the uprising began as a student movement, many of the individuals targeted, tortured, and killed by the police and military were high school and university students.|$|E
500|$|Sub-constables, {{initially}} the lowest {{rank in the}} force, were paid 75 cents a day in 1873, with a promise of [...] of land on completion of their enlistment, but the pay was cut by a third in 1878 and the land grants ceased. As a result, constables were paid a basic wage of 50 cents a day, with <b>basic</b> <b>provisions</b> included, with a senior non-commissioned officer earning three times as much. Combined with [...] "working pay" [...] bonuses for particular duties, a constable could earn over $300 a year, which was initially {{about the same as}} a Canadian school teacher. At the start of the 20th century, the rates of police pay were unchanged and had become quite low by wider Canadian standards; they were slowly increased, the basic rate rising to $1 a day in 1905, and then to $1.50 and finally $1.75 by 1919. A pension scheme was introduced in 1889, albeit in the face of political opposition.|$|E

2500|$|The Hopi and Navajo filed {{separate}} lawsuits to {{stop the}} development, while the Forest Service argued that religious rights would be unimpeded, and even facilitated, by the ski lifts—a concept that the tribes rejected. Three years later (the suits having been consolidated into one case, Wilson v. Block), the Hopi and Navajo were unable to convince the District of Columbia Circuit Court that the Peaks were [...] "indispensable" [...] to their religions, and the suit was denied. According to the judge, permitting the Snowbowl expansion may have offended their beliefs, but the Forest Service had met the <b>basic</b> <b>provisions</b> of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978. In the Wilson V. Block case, the Hopi and Navajo tribes also claimed that the Forest Service was violating the Endangered Species Act, the Wilderness Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act by using waste water on The Peaks.|$|E

40|$|Socially created {{vulnerabilities}} {{are largely}} {{ignored in the}} hazards and disaster literature {{because they are so}} difficult to measure and quantify. Social vulnerability is partially a product of social inequities – those social factors and forces that create the susceptibility of various groups to harm, and in turn affect their ability to respond, and bounce back (resilience) after the disaster. But it is more than that. Social vulnerability involves the <b>basic</b> <b>provision</b> of health care, the liveability of places, overall indicators of quality of life, and accessibility to lifelines (goods, services, emergency response personnel), capital, and political representation[URL]...|$|R

Notable ongoing work by AKF also includes work to prevent future floods in Pakistan through the use of infrastructure relief, rehabilitation and aid projects.

2500|$|For much of {{the seventeenth}} century the dietary {{provision}} for patients appears to have been inadequate. This was especially so during Crooke's regime, when inspection found several patients suffering from starvation. Corrupt staff practices were evidently a significant factor in patient malnourishment and similar abuses were noted in the 1650s and 1670s. The Governors failed to manage the supply of victuals, relying on [...] "gifts in kind" [...] for <b>basic</b> <b>provisions,</b> and the resources available to the steward to purchase foodstuffs was dependent upon the goodwill of the keeper. Patients were fed twice a day on a [...] "lowering diet" [...] (an intentionally reduced and plain diet) consisting of bread, meat, oatmeal, butter, cheese and generous amounts of beer. It is likely that daily meals alternated between meat and dairy products, almost entirely lacking in fruit or vegetables. That the portions appear to have been inadequate also likely reflected contemporary humoral theory that justified rationing the diet of the mad, the avoidance of rich foods, and a therapeutics of depletion and purgation to restore the body to balance and restrain the spirits.|$|E
