Although viruses lacking ac 109 have been previously characterized, the phenotypes differ from production of non-infectious virions to lack of virion production.

40|$|Mammalian {{cells are}} capable of {{delivering}} multiple types of membrane capsules extracellularly. The limiting membrane of late endosomes can fuse with the plasma membrane, leading to the extracellular release of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), initially contained within the endosomes, as exosomes. <b>Budding</b> <b>viruses</b> exploit the TSG 101 protein and endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery used for MVB formation to mediate the egress of viral particles from host cells. Here we report {{the discovery of a}} virus-independent cellular process that generates microvesicles that are distinct from exosomes and which, like <b>budding</b> <b>viruses,</b> are produced by direct plasma membrane budding. Such budding is driven by a specific interaction of TSG 101 with a tetrapeptide PSAP motif of an accessory protein, arrestin domain-containing protein 1 (ARRDC 1), which we show is localized to the plasma membrane through its arrestin domain. This interaction results in relocation of TSG 101 from endosomes to the plasma membrane and mediates the release of microvesicles that contain TSG 101, ARRDC 1, and other cellular proteins. Unlike exosomes, which are derived from MVBs, ARRDC 1 -mediated microvesicles (ARMMs) lack known late endosomal markers. ARMMs formation requires VPS 4 ATPase and is enhanced by the E 3 ligase WWP 2, which interacts with and ubiquitinates ARRDC 1. ARRDC 1 protein discharged into ARMMs was observed in co-cultured cells, suggesting a role for ARMMs in intercellular communication. Our findings reveal an intrinsic cellular mechanism that results in direct budding of microvesicles from the plasma membrane, providing a formal paradigm for the evolutionary recruitment of ESCRT proteins in the release of <b>budding</b> <b>viruses...</b>|$|R

In {{this study we}} showed that enhanced <b>budded</b> <b>virus</b> production occurs because the hourly rate of release of virus from AcdefrT-infected cells is higher than that for AcMNPV and it continues for longer. This may be the trigger for the induction of apoptosis late in AcdefrT-infected TN- 368 cells. However, laddering of host DNA was absent in TN- 368 cells infected with AcdefrT, but was observed in Spodoptera frugiperda cells.

Marker rescue mapping and DNA sequencing correlated a single nucleotide substitution within the baculovirusgp 41 gene with the temperature-sensitive phenotype oftsB 1074.

40|$|Influenza A virus causes {{seasonal}} epidemics, sporadic pandemics and is {{a significant}} global health burden. Influenza virus is an enveloped virus that contains a segmented negative strand RNA genome. Assembly and budding of progeny influenza virions is a complex, multi-step process that occurs in lipid raft domains on the apical membrane of infected cells. The viral proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are targeted to lipid rafts, causing the coalescence and enlargement of the raft domains. This clustering of HA and NA may cause a deformation of the membrane and the initiation of the <b>virus</b> <b>budding</b> event. M 1 is then thought to bind to the cytoplasmic tails of HA and NA where it can then polymerize and form the interior structure of the emerging virion. M 1, bound to the cytoplasmic tails of HA and NA, additionally serves as a docking site for the recruitment of the viral RNPs and may mediate the recruitment of M 2 {{to the site of}} <b>virus</b> <b>budding.</b> M 2 initially stabilizes the site of budding, possibly enabling the polymerization of the matrix protein and the formation of filamentous virions.

40|$|This thesis studies virus {{dynamics}} within host by mathematical models, and topics discussed include viral release strategies, viral spreading mechanism, {{and interaction}} of virus with the immune system. Firstly, we propose a delay differential equation model with distributed delay {{to investigate the}} evolutionary competition between budding and lytic viral release strategies. We find that when antibody is not established, the dynamics of competition depends on the respective basic reproduction numbers of the two viruses. If the basic reproductive ratio of <b>budding</b> <b>virus</b> is {{greater than that of}} lytic <b>virus</b> and one, <b>budding</b> <b>virus</b> can survive. When antibody is established for both strains but the neutralization capacities are the same for both strains, consequence of the competition also depends only on the basic reproduction numbers of the <b>budding</b> and lytic <b>viruses.</b> Using two concrete forms of the viral production functions, we are also able to conclude that <b>budding</b> <b>virus</b> will outcompete if the rates of viral production, death rates of infected cells and neutralizing capacities of the antibodies are the same for <b>budding</b> and lytic <b>viruses.</b> In this case, budding strategy would have evolutionary advantage. However, if the antibody neutralization capacity for the <b>budding</b> <b>virus</b> is larger than that for the lytic virus, lytic virus can outcompete provided that its reproductive ratio is very high. An explicit threshold is derived. Secondly, we consider model containing two modes for viral infection and spread, one is the diffusion-limited free virus transmission and the other is the direct cell-to-cell transfer of viral particles. By incorporating infection age, a rigorous analysis of the model shows that the model demonstrates a global threshold dynamics, fully described by the basic reproduction number, which is identified explicitly. The formula for the basic reproduction number of our model reveals the effects of various model parameters including the transmission rates of the two modes, and the impact of the infection age. We show that basic reproduction number is underestimated in the existing models that only consider the cell-free virus transmission, or the cell-to-cell infection, ignoring the other. Assuming logistic growth for target cells, we find that if the basic reproduction number is greater than one, the infection can persist and Hopf bifurcation can occur from the positive equilibrium within certain parameter ranges. Thirdly, the repulsion effect of superinfecting virion by infected cells is studied by a reaction diffusion equation model for virus infection dynamics. In this model, the diffusion of virus depends not only on its concentration gradient but also on the concentration of infected cells. The basic reproduction number, linear stability of steady states, spreading speed, and existence of traveling wave solutions for the model are discussed. It is shown that viruses spread more rapidly with the repulsion effect of infected cells on superinfecting virions, than with random diffusion only. For our model, the spreading speed of free virus is not consistent with the minimal traveling wave speed. With our general model, numerical computations of the spreading speed shows that the repulsion of superinfecting vision promotes the spread of virus, which confirms, not only qualitatively but also quantitatively, some recent experimental results. Finally, the effect of chemotactic movement of CD 8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) on HIV- 1 infection dynamics is studied by a reaction diffusion model with chemotaxis. Choosing a typical chemosensitive function, we find that chemoattractive movement of CTLs due to HIV infection does not change stability of the positive steady state of the model. However, chemorepulsion movement of CTLs destabilizes the positive steady state as the strength of the chemotactic sensitivity increases. In this case, Turing instability occurs, which can be Hopf bifurcation or steady state bifurcation, and spatial heterogeneous patterns may form...|$|R

In this study, we characterized these viruses in two permissive hosts, Spodoptera frugiperda and Trichoplusia ni, using two insect developmental stages and two infection routes, by feeding and intrahemocoelic injection. In addition, we constructed an AcMNPV bacmid overexpressing vfgf under polyhedrin promoter control and characterized it in both cell culture and insects. Deletion of vfgf had no effect on the infectivity of AcMNPV.

It seems likely that this protoplasmic partition is related to the binding with the nucleocapsid that takes place during the <b>budding</b> of the <b>virus.</b> At the cell surface, viral glycoproteins always appeared clustered and were predominantly associated with budding figures: moreover, large portions of the plasma membrane were devoid of both glycoproteins and <b>budding</b> <b>viruses.</b> Sindbis virus has only two integral membrane glycoproteins...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBaculoviruses encode {{fibroblast}} {{growth factor}} (vfgf) homologs whose function during virus infection is unknown. We constructed a recombinant bacmid of Autographa californica M nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) lacking a functional vfgf and characterized {{it in two}} insect cell lines. The kinetics of <b>budded</b> <b>virus</b> production were similar in the parental and vfgf-deficient viruses in both cell lines at both high and low multiplicities of infection. In addition, no obvious differences were observed between the mutant and parental viruses in protein or DNA synthesis. Finally, coinfection of vfgf-containing and -deficient viruses and passage for several generations did not reveal a consistent growth advantage for either virus...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus alpha anti-insect toxin (LqhαIT) cDNA was {{engineered}} {{into the}} Autographa californica Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (AcNPV) genome. Insect cells {{infected with the}} recombinant virus secreted a functional LqhαIT polypeptide. Spodoptera littoralis and Heliothis armigera larvae injected with recombinant <b>budded</b> <b>virus,</b> showed typical intoxication symptoms. This recombinant virus showed enhanced insecticidal potency against H. armigera larvae compared with wild type AcNPV. The present expression system will facilitate: (1) the future elucidation of structural elements involved in its prominent anti-insect toxicity; and (2) the future design of genetically modified alpha toxins with improved anti-insect selectivity...|$|E
40|$|Entry of the <b>budded</b> <b>virus</b> form of baculoviruses into insect and {{mammalian}} {{cells is}} generally thought to occur through a low-pH-dependent endocytosis pathway, possibly through clathrin-coated pits. This insight is primarily based on (immuno) electron microscopy studies but requires biochemical support {{to exclude the}} use of other pathways. Here, we demonstrate using various inhibitors that functional entry of baculoviruses into insect and mammalian cells is primarily dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Our results further suggest that caveolae are somehow involved in baculovirus entry in mammalian cells. A caveolar endocytosis inhibitor, genistein, enhances baculovirus transduction in these cells considerably...|$|E

Specific immunolabel with antiviral glycoprotein antibodies or with conventional lectin label (wheat germ agglutinin) were {{used in conjunction with}} colloidal gold-conjugated protein A or ovomucoid, respectively. In addition, intact infected cells were analyzed with both labeling procedures. Experiments with Sindbis infected-chick embryo fibroblast cells were carried out as controls. Viral transmembrane glycoproteins appeared present in freeze- fractured inner and outer nuclear membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi stacks and vesicles, and plasma membranes; a clear preferential partition with the exoplasmic faces of all intracellular membranes was observed. By contrast, at the plasma membrane level, Sindbis glycoproteins were found to partition preferentially with the protoplasmic face.

40|$|Enhancins are a {{class of}} metalloproteases found in some baculoviruses that enhance viral {{infection}} by degrading the peritrophic, membrane (PM) of the insect midgut. However, sequencing has revealed enhancin-like genes with 24 - 25 % homology to viral enhancins, in the genomes of Yersinia pestis and Bacillus anthracis. AcMNPV does not encode enhancin therefore recombinant AcMNPV <b>budded</b> <b>viruses</b> (BVs) and polyhedra inclusion bodies (PIBs) were generated expressing the bacterial Enhancins. Bacterial Enhancins {{were found to be}} cytotoxic when compared to viral enhancin, however, larval bioassays suggested that the bacterial Enhancins did not enhance infection {{in the same way as}} viral Enhancin. This suggests that the bacterial Enhancins may have evolved a distinct biochemical function. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a method}} for {{freeze-drying}} intact cells, uninfected and murine leukemia virus (MuLV) -infected JLSV 9 cell surfaces, as well as murine mammary tumor virus (MuMTV) -infected cell surfaces, were examined by electron microscopy. The 10 -nm knobs of MuLV and the 5 -nm spikes of MuMTV were clearly revealed on the surfaces of <b>budding</b> <b>viruses</b> and were also found dispersed over the cell surface. The MuLV knobs are randomly arranged on the virus surface, whereas the MuMTV spikes are much more ordered. Because freeze-fractured budding viral envelopes are devoid of intramembranous particles, the observed surface particles {{do not appear to}} be merely accentuated intramembranous particles. This technique should permit further analysis of the morphogenesis of viral envelopes without the need for externally applied labels...|$|R
