(Use your own discretion with this commentary, as Squash and tomatoes originate from the Americas, and are not 'distinctive' to the region as the above suggested.) Eggplant is often fried in slices and dressed in yogurt and garlic, or roasted over an open fire, then pulped and dressed with tahini (sesame paste), lemon juice, garlic, and cumin, a dish known as baba ghanoush. Tomato is the most ubiquitous ingredient in Middle Eastern cookery. It is used fresh in a variety of salads, cooked in almost every stew and broth, and grilled with kebab.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Root and <b>bulb</b> <b>vegetables</b> (RBV) include carrots, {{celeriac}} (root celery), parsnips (Apiaceae), onions, garlic, and leek (Alliaceae) —food crops grown globally {{and consumed}} worldwide. Few data analysis platforms are currently available where data collection, annotation and integration initiatives {{are focused on}} RBV plant groups. Scientists working on RBV include breeders, geneticists, taxonomists, plant pathologists, and plant physiologists who use genomic data {{for a wide range}} of activities including the development of molecular genetic maps, delineation of taxonomic relationships, and investigation of molecular aspects of gene expression in biochemical pathways and disease responses. With genomic data coming from such diverse areas of plant science, availability of a community resource focused on these RBV data types would be of great interest to this scientific community. Description The RoBuST database has been developed to initiate a platform for collecting and organizing genomic information useful for RBV researchers. The current release of RoBuST contains genomics data for 294 Alliaceae and 816 Apiaceae plant species and has the following features: (1) comprehensive sequence annotations of 3663 genes 5959 RNAs, 22, 723 ESTs and 11, 438 regulatory sequence elements from Apiaceae and Alliaceae plant families; (2) graphical tools for visualization and analysis of sequence data; (3) access to traits, biosynthetic pathways, genetic linkage maps and molecular taxonomy data associated with Alliaceae and Apiaceae plants; and (4) comprehensive plant splice signal repository of 659, 369 splice signals collected from 6015 plant species for comparative analysis of plant splicing patterns.

40|$|In total 1216 {{vegetables}} {{obtained from}} Dutch stores during 2012 and 2013 were analysed {{to determine the}} prevalence of 3 rd-generation cephalosporin (3 GC) resistant bacteria on soil-grown fresh produce possibly consumed raw. Vegetables grown conventionally and organically, from Dutch as well as foreign origin were compared. Included were the following vegetable types; blanched celery (n= 192), bunched carrots (n= 190), butterhead lettuce (n= 137), chicory (n= 96), endive (n= 188), iceberg lettuce (n= 193) and radish (n= 120). Overall, 3 GC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were detected on 5. 2 % of vegetables. Based on primary habitat and mechanism of 3 GC-resistance, these bacteria could be divided into four groups: ESBL-producing faecal species (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp.), AmpC-producing faecal species (Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp.), ESBL-producing environmental species (Pantoea spp., Rahnella aquatilis, Serratia fonticola), and AmpC-producing environmental species (Cedecca spp., Hafnia alvei, Pantoea spp., Serratia plymuthica), which were detected on 0. 8 %, 1. 2 %, 2. 6 % and 0. 4 % of the vegetables analysed, respectively. Contamination with faecal 3 GC-resistant bacteria was most frequently observed in root and <b>bulb</b> <b>vegetables</b> (average prevalence 4. 4 %), and less frequently in stem vegetables (prevalence 1. 6 %) and leafy greens (average prevalence 0. 6 %). In Dutch stores, only four of the included vegetable types (blanched celery, bunched carrots, endive, iceberg lettuce) were available in all four possible variants: Dutch/conventional, Dutch/organic, foreign/conventional, foreign/organic. With respect to these vegetable types, {{no statistically significant difference}} was observed in prevalence of 3 GC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae between country of origin or cultivation type (5. 2 %, 5. 7 %, 5. 7 % and 3. 3 %, respectively). Vegetables consumed raw may be a source of dissemination of 3 GC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and their resistance genes to humans. The magnitude of the associated public health risk presumably depends on the types of bacteria that are ingested, i. e., faecal or environmental species, and may therefore be higher for root and <b>bulb</b> <b>vegetables</b> compared to leafy greens...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} three {{different}} parts: (1) An analyses of dietary consumption, diet diversity {{and risk of}} developing bladder cancer within a case-control study in China. This study showed that higher diet diversity, particularly a diet varied in fruit may {{reduce the risk of}} developing bladder cancer. In addition, there was a positive association between the consumption of red meat, organ meat, leafy vegetables, <b>bulb</b> <b>vegetables</b> or preserved vegetables may increase the risk of bladder cancer. The consumption of citrus fruits, stone fruits, vine fruits, flower vegetables, fresh fish, potatoes and dairy products may decrease the risk of developing bladder cancer. (2) A dose-response meta-analysis on the association between total fluid consumption and bladder cancer was conducted. The {{results of this study suggest}} a non-linear relationship between total fluid intake and bladder cancer risk in men. Also, the findings indicates that low to moderate fluid consumption was not associated with an increased risk of developing bladder cancer; although fluid consumption exceeding 8 cups per day might increase the risk of developing bladder cancer.

5|$|Jainism {{is perhaps}} the only {{religion}} {{in the world that}} requires all its adherents to follow a strict vegetarian diet. Vegetarian food that also involves more harm to the living beings such as roots, <b>bulbs,</b> multi seeded <b>vegetables</b> etc. are avoided by strict Jains. The importance of ahimsa manifests in many other ways in the daily life of Jains. For a layperson it means participating in business that results in least amount of violence to living beings. No furs, plumes or silk are worn. Use of leather is kept to a minimum and must in any event be from naturally dead animals. Food is usually eaten during the day unless unavoidable, since there is too much danger of injuring insects in cooking at night. The Jain will not use an open light nor leave a container of liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed; even with this precaution, liquids are always strained before use. Through the ages Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury, and this accounts for the disproportionate number who have entered banking, commerce and other mercantile trades.|$|R
40|$|Food of non-animal origin (FoNAO) is {{consumed}} {{in a variety}} of forms, and a major component of almost all meals. These food types have the potential to be associated with large outbreaks as seen in 2011 associated with VTEC O 104. A comparison of the incidence of human cases linked to consumption of FoNAO and of food of animal origin (FoAO) was carried out to provide an indication of the proportionality between these two groups of foods. It was concluded that outbreak data reported as part of EU Zoonoses Monitoring is currently the only option for EU-wide comparative estimates. Using this data from 2007 to 2011, FoNAO were associated with 10 % of the outbreaks, 26 % of the cases, 35 % of the hospitalisations and 46 % of the deaths. If the data from the 2011 VTEC O 104 outbreak is excluded, FoNAO was associated with 10 % of the outbreaks, 18 % of cases, but only 8 % of the hospitalisations and 5 % of the deaths. From 2008 to 2011 there was an increase in the numbers of reported outbreaks, cases, hospitalisations and deaths associated with food of non-animal origin. In order to identify and rank specific food/pathogen combinations most often linked to human cases originating from FoNAO in the EU, a model was developed using seven criteria: strength of associations between food and pathogen based on the foodborne outbreak data from EU Zoonoses Monitoring (2007 - 11), incidence of illness, burden of disease, dose-response relationship, consumption, prevalence of contamination and pathogen growth potential during shelf life. Shortcomings in the approach using outbreak data were discussed. The top ranking food/pathogen combination was Salmonellaspp. and leafy greens eaten raw followed by (in equal rank) Salmonellaspp. and <b>bulb</b> and stem <b>vegetables,</b> Salmonellaspp. and tomatoes, Salmonellaspp. and melons, and pathogenic Escherichia coli and fresh pods, legumes or grain...|$|R

40|$|The plant-parasitic {{nematodes}} are {{the most}} important pests around the world. Many species of the plant-parasitic nematodes cause high losses of crop yield and many of them have a quarantine status. The stem and bulb nematode Ditylenchus dipsaci (Kühn 1857) Filipjev 1836 is a migratory endoparasite nematode of over five hundred vas-cular plant species. The stem nematode D. dipsaci is prevalent {{in a wide range of}} climatic condi-tions, where moisture regimes enable nematode infection, multiplication and dispersal. The main method of D. dipsaci control is crop rotation, but the presence of morphologically indistinguishable host races with different host preferences makes rotation difficult (Wendt et al. 1993). The biologi-cal races exhibit different degrees of reproductive isolation, such as partial or complete reproduc-tive incompatibility (Erikson 1974). Each biologi-cal race is able to complete its life cycle only on a specific plant host. Among the most important plant hosts of D. dipsaci in Central Europe are <b>bulb</b> <b>vegetables</b> (onion, garlic and leek), carrot, alfalfa, clover, sugar beet, chicory, potatoes, strawberry, ornamental bulb plants (Narcissus spp.), and also many common weeds. Symptoms on host plants are not always specific as for appearance. Early infested plants and low infested seeds show no symptoms. Nematodes cause swellings and distor-tion of aerial plant parts and necrosis or rotting of stem bases, bulbs, tubers and rhizomes.

40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, France, herewith {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from Syngenta AGRO S. A. S. to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance difenoconazole {{in a wide range of}} crops. In order to accommodate for the intended European uses on quinces, several root crops, <b>bulb</b> <b>vegetables,</b> cucurbits (inedible peel), witloof chicory, globe artichokes, rice and chicory roots and to accommodate the authorized use in Brazil on papaya, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs for difenoconazole in all these crops. The EMS drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals for all the crops considered. The applicant has not submitted data on TDM residues in the crops under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the intended use of difenoconazole on the crops under consideration will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values for difenoconazole and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern. The consumer risk assessment regarding the TDMs was not undertaken in the framework of the current application and has to be performed as soon as the confirmatory data for triazole pesticides are available and a suitable risk assessment methodology has been developed, taking into account the contribution of the TDMs present in primary crops, rotational crops, processed commodities and products of animal origin resulting from different triazole pesticides...|$|E
40|$|Endotoxins are {{cell wall}} {{components}} of Gram-negative bacteria that occur commonly on plants and plant products and as gut commensals. A large variability in airborne endotoxin exposure levels has been measured {{in a range}} of agricultural and other occupational environments. Inhalation of endotoxins may cause respiratory and inflammatory effects characterized by increased levels of infiltrating neutrophils and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conversely, several studies have shown inverse associations between domestic endotoxin exposure and atopy and atopic asthma in children from farming families, but also in children living in urban areas. A number of studies has shown that childhood farm exposures continue to protect against atopic sensitization into adulthood, and recent studies suggested that endotoxin exposure during adulthood still protects against atopy and atopic asthma. Evidently, not all endotoxin-exposed workers develop respiratory or inflammatory responses, even at very high exposure levels. Genetic and non-genetic susceptibility factors may interact with endotoxin exposure, resulting in inter-individual heterogeneity in type and magnitude of responses within groups of individuals with apparently identical exposures. The main aim of this thesis was to investigate associations between endotoxin exposure and the occurrence of respiratory and allergic effects in adults with sometimes extremely high work-related exposure. Cytokine responsiveness in an ex vivo whole blood assay and genetic variation in innate immunity genes were evaluated as susceptibility factors in associations between exposure and respiratory and allergic outcomes. A total of 249 full-shift personal inhalable dust samples were collected for endotoxin exposure measurements among Dutch farmers and agricultural industry workers (flower <b>bulb,</b> animal feed, <b>vegetable</b> seed, and onion processing workers). A wide range of endotoxin levels were found (~ 10 to 10, 000 EU/m 3) ranging from slightly elevated levels close to background to extremely high levels usually not encountered in the home and general environment. A job-exposure matrix was constructed to assign endotoxin exposure levels to all 878 participants in the study. Significant and positive exposure-response relationships were found between endotoxin exposure and asthma-related outcomes, which were characterized by a predominantly non-atopic phenotype. In contrast, inverse associations between occupational endotoxin exposure and hay fever and atopic sensitization were found. An important role for individual susceptibility to the adverse effects of endotoxin was implied by the finding that associations between occupational endotoxin exposure and respiratory effects were only observed in the subgroup of subjects with above median cytokine response by ex vivo LPS-stimulated blood monocytes. A nested case-control study in young farmers, and a case-control and family-based study in adults suggested gene-environment interactions between genes involved in innate immunity responses such as CD 14 and Toll-like receptor genes (TLR 2, TLR 4, TLR 9) and occupational and environmental exposure to endotoxin or other microbial agents, in their associations with asthma or atopy. Although endotoxin might protect against allergies, this thesis emphasizes the need to lower endotoxin exposure levels in the agricultural environment to protect workers against chronic respiratory health effects. Regulations should not only focus on the average worker but should, where possible, also provide sufficient protection for the most susceptible individuals in any given context...|$|R
