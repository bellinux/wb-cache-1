40|$|Dated {{molecular}} phylogenies are {{the basis}} for understanding species diversity and for linking changes in rates of diversification with historical events such as restructuring in developmental pathways, genome doubling, or dispersal onto a new continent. Valid fossil calibration points {{are essential to the}} accurate estimation of divergence dates, but for many groups of flowering plants fossil evidence is unavailable or limited. Arabidopsis thaliana, the primary genetic model in plant biology and the first plant to have its entire genome sequenced, belongs to one such group, the plant family Brassicaceae. Thus, the timing of A. thaliana evolution and the history of its genome have been controversial. We bring previously overlooked fossil evidence to bear on these questions and find the split between A. thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata occurred about 13 Mya, and that the split between Arabidopsis and the <b>Brassica</b> <b>complex</b> (broccoli, cabbage, canola) occurred about 43 Mya. These estimates, which are two- to threefold older than previous estimates, indicate that gene, genomic, and developmental evolution occurred much more slowly than previously hypothesized and that Arabidopsis evolved during a period of warming rather than of cooling. We detected a 2 - to 10 -fold shift in species diversification rates on the branch uniting Brassicaceae with its sister families. The timing of this shift suggests a possible impact of the Cretaceous–Paleogene mass extinction on their radiation and that Brassicales codiversified with pierid butterflies that specialize on mustard-oil–producing plants...|$|E
40|$|Calonectria (Ca.) {{species and}} their Cylindrocladium (Cy.) anamorphs are {{well-known}} pathogens of forest nursery plants in subtropical and tropical {{areas of the}} world. An investigation of the mortality of rooted Pinus cuttings in a commercial forest nursery in Colombia led to the isolation of two Cylindrocladium anamorphs of Calonectria species. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify these species using DNA sequence data and morphological comparisons. Two species were identified, namely one undescribed species, and Cy. gracile, which is allocated to Calonectria as Ca. brassicae. The new species, Ca. brachiatica, resides in the Ca. <b>brassicae</b> species <b>complex.</b> Pathogenicity tests with Ca. brachiatica and Ca. brassicae showed that both are able to cause disease on Pinus maximinoi and P. tecunumanii.

40|$|Brassicaceae is an {{important}} family of the plant kingdom which includes several plants of major economic importance. The Brassica spp. and Arabidopsis share much-conserved colinearity between their genomes which can be exploited for the genomic research in Brassicaceae crops. In this study, 131, 286 ESTs of five Brassicaceae species were assembled into unigene contigs and compared with Arabidopsis gene indices. Almost all the unigenes of Brassicaceae species showed high similarities with Arabidopsis genes except those of B. napus, where 90 % of unigenes were found similar. A total of 9, 699 SSRs were identified in the unigenes. PCR primers were designed based on this information and amplified across species for validation. Functional annotation of unigenes showed {{that the majority of}} the genes are present in metabolism and energy functional classes. It is expected that comparative genome analysis between Arabidopsis and related crop species will expedite research in the more <b>complex</b> <b>Brassica</b> genomes.

40|$|Nineteen aphid {{species were}} tested {{for their ability}} to {{transmit}} Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) from and to zucchini under laboratory conditions. Sixteen species were found to be new vectors of ZYMV (i. e. Aphis craccae, Aphis fabae, Aphis nerii, Aulacorthum solani, Brachycaudus cardui, Brevicoryne <b>brassicae,</b> Hyalopterus pruni <b>complex,</b> Hyperomyzus lactucae, Macrosiphoniella sanborni, Macrosiphum rosae, Metopolophium dirhodum, Myzus cerasi, Rhopalosiphum maidis, R. padi, Semiaphis dauci and Sipha maydis). Their transmission efficiency by a single aphid was low (0. 1 - 4. 2 %). Myzus persicae was used as a control and was the most efficient vector (41. 1 %, one aphid per plant). Hayhurstia atriplicis, Myzus ascalonicus and Sitobion avenae did not transmit the virus. In four out of six new vectors assayed in arena tests for propensity estimation, propensity was higher than efficiency. Data from an experimental zucchini field in northern Greece revealed a high correlation between ZYMV spread and alatae of the vector species. The most abundant aphid vectors during 2 years experimentation were M. persicae, Aphis gossypii and Aphis spiraecola. The possible role of the 16 new and the previously known aphid vectors in the epidemiology of ZYMV was investigated using data of transmission efficiency combined with the captures of their alatae in the Greek net of a Rothamsted type suction trap. © 2006 Blackwell Verlag...|$|R

40|$|Brassicaceae family {{comprises}} {{plant species}} that are very important as vegetable crops, such as the species <b>complex</b> <b>Brassica</b> oleracea and Brassica rapa. Alternaria brassicicola and A. brassicae {{are among the most}} important pathogens of Brassicaceae causing Alternaria leaf spot disease. The occurrence and prevalence of Alternaria species causing leaf spots in brassica crops in Pernambuco was acessed, as well as the existence of a possible preference by vegetable host for these pathogens. Twenty-eight fields were surveyed in the Agreste region of Pernambuco state, in the 2005 and 2006 growing seasons. In each year, 10 Chinese cabbage, six cabbage, six cauliflower and six broccoli fields were visited. In each field, 50 leaves showing at least five lesions were randomly collected. Species identification was performed taking into account morphology of the conidia that was compared with literature data. Among the two Alternaria species found, A. brassicae was found in all Chinese cabbage fields while A. brassicicola was found in all fields of cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli. Overall, A. brassicicola was more prevalent than A. brassicae. In Chinese cabbage there was predominance of A. brassicae, with mean prevalence of 91. 0 % and 96. 5 % in 2005 and 2006. On the other hand, in broccoli and cabbage there was high predominance of A. brassicicola, with mean prevalence between 95. 1 % and 99. 8 %. In cauliflower, although the prevalence has been of A. brassicicola, high frequency of A. brassicae was noted. The frequency of co-occurrence of both Alternaria species was very low. The results of this study reinforce the hypothesis of existence of host preference within species of Alternaria that cause leaf spots in brassica crops, especially when Chinese cabbage, broccoli and cabbage are considered. This information is critical to developing strategies for managing Alternaria leaf spots in Brassicaceae species...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. January 2017. Major: Applied Plant Sciences. Advisor: Mary Rogers. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 68 pages. Pieris rapae is an insect pest the feeds exclusively on {{species of the}} Brassicaceae. It is a serious economic pest in commercial horticulture as larvae chew large holes in leaves, can destroy developing heads of broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage, and otherwise contaminate or stain produce, rendering it unmarketable. P. rapae is notoriously difficult to manage in organic production systems, and organic brassica growers traditionally rely upon floating row covers or biopesticides to prevent feeding damage. Natural pest resistance is important when making cultivar recommendations for production systems with limited pest management options, and our research evaluates natural and induced resistance in broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) against P. rapae {{with a focus on}} the roles that glucosinolates (GSLs) play in resistance. GSLs are constitutive and inducible secondary metabolites in members of the Brassicaceae and are toxic to generalist insect pests. However, the relationship between GSL and P. rapae, a <b>brassica</b> specialist, is <b>complex</b> and not well understood. A controlled greenhouse study evaluated the effects of P. rapae herbivory on GSL induction and subsequent larval growth and performance on two broccoli cultivars (‘Beneforte’ and ‘Green Magic’) that varied in concentration of two GSLs, glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin. Our results show that neoglucobrassicin and glucobrassicin concentrations did not significantly increase as a result of herbivory, but the overall growth and performance of P. rapae was influenced by cultivar. Larvae consumed less total leaf area and weighed less as pupae when feeding on ‘Beneforte’, which also had a significantly higher glucobrassicin concentration, indicating that cultivar may be important in resistance against P. rapae. A field study performed at two certified organic farms in Minnesota in 2015 and 2016 evaluated six broccoli cultivars (‘Belstar,’ ‘Fiesta,’ ‘Green Magic,’ ‘Marathon,’ ‘Packman,’ and ‘Thompson’) for natural resistance to P. rapae and for yield performance. The cultivars in this study did not significantly differ in susceptibility to P. rapae infestation, and neoglucobrassicin and glucobrassicin concentrations did not explain P. rapae egg and larval abundance. We conclude that cultivar selection should not be based on natural resistance to pests in this case but rather based on cultivar performance. ‘Belstar,’ ‘Fiesta’, ‘Green Magic,’ and ‘Packman’ were top performers and produced a consistent and high quality product, and therefore we would recommended these cultivars as acceptable selections for organic systems in Minnesota...|$|R

The genome {{sequence}} of an organism provides {{the basis for}} gene discovery, the analysis of genetic variation and the association of genomic variation with heritable traits. Second generation sequencing technologies and applied bioinformatics tools can provide an unprecedented insight into genome structure and variation. This technology {{is still in its}} infancy, yet is already making a huge impact in our understanding of biological processes. We have developed and applied novel bioinformatics tools and approaches for Illumina second generation sequence data analysis with the aim of understanding complex genomes. These range from large genome polyploid crops such as wheat and <b>Brassica</b> species, to <b>complex</b> environmental metagenomic samples. For crop genomes, we aim to identify genes, novel and mapped genetic markers and develop methods for the association of agronomic traits with underlying genomic variation. In canola (Brassica napus) we have identified more than 1 million SNPs across the polyploid genome, with a validation accuracy of 96 %. This information has been integrated with mapped genetic marker and trait information within searchable databases. The resulting tools enable the association of candidate genes with trait associated genetic markers and the study of Brassica genome evolution under selection. The genome of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is greater than 16 Gbp in size and consists predominantly of repetitive elements. There has been some debate over whether second generation sequencing can be applied for such a large and complex genome. We have reduced genome sequence complexity by sequencing isolated chromosome arms, with the aim to assemble low copy and genic regions. Our approach enabled the assembly of all genes, as well as {{a substantial portion of the}} repetitive fraction. The syntenic relationship between wheat and a sequenced close relative, Brachypodium distachyon, has been used to produce annotated syntenic builds whereby the majority of genes have been placed in an approximate order and orientation. Our results suggest that the sequencing of isolated chromosome arms can provide valuable information on the gene content of wheat, and that these assemblies can be applied for genome wide SNP discovery, the identification of candidate genes associated with genetically mapped traits and investigation of genome evolution in this important crop. Finally, as an example of second generation metagenome bioinformatics, I will describe approaches to understand the complex coral holobiont and its response to environmental change, a study which is challenged by a lack of reference genomes or even knowledge of which species are present in the sample.
