40|$|The {{combination}} of landing future high mass systems with small landing footprints on Mars may {{require the use}} of both propulsive deceleration (PD) and reaction control system (RCS) thrusters. However, the interactions between these jets and the supersonic or hypersonic freestream involve complex flow phenomena that are still not well understood. This paper describes numerical and experimental techniques that are used in an effort to develop physically accurate methods to compute these complex flow interactions. The paper also presents a numerical parametric study that is conducted using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code LeMANS. This study examines the effects of low temperature and density values and radially nonuniform freestream conditions in the hypersonic wind tunnel facility using an aeroshell based on the Mars Science Laboratory in Mach 12 flow of nitrogen gas with PD and RCS jets off. It is shown that although the Blottner and the Sutherland models compute different values of viscosity at low temperatures, the flowfield and surface properties predicted by LeMANS using these two models are in very close agreement. The study also shows that thermal nonequilibrium effects are negligible. The radial freestream nonuniformities, however, have considerable effects on the flowfield and surface properties. The nonuniform conditions change the temperature and density distributions in most of the computational domain, widen the bow shock around the aeroshell, increase continuum <b>breakdown</b> <b>regions,</b> and decrease the drag coefficient of the capsule compared to the uniform conditions.
