40|$|The {{principle}} {{objective of}} management in strictly protected areas, such as national parks, {{is to reduce}} human intervention {{as much as possible}} to secure natural assemblages and processes. As wildlife management in many national parks has to deal with increased ungulate populations and a broad lack of predators, park managers need to know how their wildlife management, including feeding and hunting, disturbs ungulate behaviour, which in turn might affect natural processes. One measure for this effect is the spatial distribution of browsing pressure in the landscape. Here we measured the browsing activity of ungulates on 5841 vegetation plots in the montane Bavarian Forest National Park to test the hypothesis that browsing in the landscape is mostly influenced by environmental covariables not related to park management. The survey revealed a browsing intensity that allows regrowth of tree species most palatable for ungulates. A comparison of different predictor sets in our spatial additive logistic regression models for silver fir, common rowan and European beech revealed that management activities and space are most important in explaining the variation in <b>browsing</b> <b>level.</b> These quantitative results underline that management activities are of major relevance for the variation of browsing intensity. Thereby, these activities shape a landscape of management that strongly contrasts the aims of the national park to reduce anthropogenic influence on natural processes. We therefore urge all park managers to carefully reconsider the necessity and effect of their management activities, especially of winter feeding, deer control areas and hiking trails...|$|E

40|$|The traffic {{patterns}} {{observed in a}} multimedia Web environment are {{quite different from the}} traffic variations experienced in communicating a single media stream. In particular, traffic variations within a single multimedia object are mainly due to inter frame compression. However, traffic generated by a multimedia server has varying capacity requirement at browsing, document and object levels. ^ The <b>browsing</b> <b>level</b> variations in the network capacity usage are caused by the user 2 ̆ 7 s interactions. In this dissertation, neuro-fuzzy logic is used to model the workload generated in the Web browsing environment. A set of parameters that are used to characterize the work-load generated by the multimedia server is proposed. Consequently, a Neuro-Fuzzy Scheduler (NFS) that makes an intelligent compromise among multi-criteria by properly combining some elementary scheduling heuristics, is presented. Performance of the NFS is compared with several known heuristics and a branch and bound algorithm. The results show that the proposed neuro-fuzzy scheduler can dynamically adjust to the varying work-load quite well. ^ The document level variations in the network capacity usage are due to the changing level of concurrency and the characteristics of the component objects within a multimedia document (MMD). A scheme to quantify the amortized capacity and destination buffering requirement of an MMD is presented. Trade-offs between network resources and user 2 ̆ 7 s quality of acceptance are also studied. ^ The characterization of MMDs {{is based on the assumption}} that the object level variation for the MMD can be modeled using the effective capacity approximation. An algorithm for modeling traffic generated by a single multimedia object, based on the effective capacity approximation, is proposed. The scalability aspects of the proposed algorithm are compared with some of the previously known schemes for effective capacity computation. The performance of the proposed CAC scheme is evaluated using known performance bounds and simulation results. The results show that the scheme scales well with increasing amount of resources (link capacity and buffer size) and accommodates intelligently the mix of traffic offered by sources of diversed burstiness characteristics. ...|$|E

To determine post-fire regrowth of riparian vegetation, height, crown area, crown volume, and <b>browse</b> <b>levels</b> were measured for key riparian shrub species in streamside burned and unburned plots along second-order streams in western Wyoming. Shrubs in the burned plots were subject to high <b>levels</b> of <b>browse</b> – up to 84 percent of the leaders were browsed – by native ungulates in 2002, the second post-fire year (September 2001 to September 2002).

In the third post-fire year, September 2002 to September 2003, four of the six most common species showed no increase in crown area or crown volume, indicating that the combination of native ungulate and cattle browsing suppressed their growth.

This work addresses how browsing and competition with other vegetation interact to drive sapling growth and morphology of the widespread tree species B. pubescens. We took above-ground morphological measurements of B. pubescens saplings within an intimate mosaic of Calluna vulgaris and Molinia caerulea, comparing saplings growing with each of the two plant species under three different red deer (Cervus elaphus) densities, allowing comparison of different levels of both past and present <b>levels</b> of <b>browsing</b> damage. Saplings growing in M. caerulea dominated vegetation responded to reduced browsing with faster growth than those growing in C. vulgaris dominated vegetation. However, we found that when natural <b>browsing</b> <b>levels</b> were high, <b>browsing</b> masked any differences in inter-specific interactions between plant species. We propose that, in regeneration schemes where deer densities are reduced, these differences should confer a competitive advantage to saplings growing with M. caerulea over those growing with C. vulgaris. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of browsing history, rather than just current <b>browsing</b> <b>levels,</b> in determining sapling growth responses under different herbivore management regimes. This study highlights the importance of multi-factor interactions in determining plant growth and morphology under different conditions. In particular we identify the prevalence of interactions between competition, herbivory and time, as determining the potential growth and morphology of B. pubescens saplings in regeneration areas. This has important implications for the management of sites where browsing impedes the natural regeneration of trees and shrubs, or where herbivore densities have been reduced to encourage woodland regeneration...|$|R

40|$|Aims: Aspen forests {{around the}} {{northern}} hemisphere provide rich biodiversity compared to surrounding vegetation types. In both North America and Europe, however, aspen are threatened {{by a variety of}} human impacts: clear-felling, land development, water diversions, fire suppression, and both wild and domestic ungulate herbivory. We conducted a landscape assessment of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) for the purpose of identifying key components of resilience. Specifically, we strove to test novel measures linking plant-animal interactions, compare crucial functional differences in aspen types, and make appropriate restorative recommendations based on the outcome of these assessments. Location: The Book Cliffs region of eastern Utah and western Colorado, USA. Methods: Seventy-seven one hectare plots were sampled for forest structure, composition, regeneration and recruitment, landscape elements, <b>browse</b> <b>level,</b> and herbivore use. Use was determined by counting the number of pellet groups by ungulate species at each sample location. We tested the efficacy of a visual stand condition rating system when compared to objective metrics. A series of non-parametric analyses were used to compare functional aspen types and stand condition groups by key variables. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) allowed us to explore all our data to find the most critical measures of aspen stand conditions for the purpose of better informing future aspen monitoring. Results: Results indicate that plots differed significantly by seral or stable aspen functional types, stand condition rating, and browse species use. Ordination analysis revealed that regeneration level and herbivore use were the strongest objective indicators of aspen stand conditions, while the stand condition rating proved a valuable subjective index of forest status. While ungulate herbivory of aspen is problematic internationally, our results show acute impacts where moderate slopes, relatively low water availability, and intense browsing predominate. Conclusions: Appropriate measures of aspen communities, informed by crucial functional divisions, have allowed us to gain a clear understanding of conditions across this large landscape.

40|$|Aspen (Populus tremula L.) is {{associated}} with high biodiversity and provides high-quality forage for wild browsing herbivores in boreal and temperate ecosystems. The long-term persistence of aspen in many regions in Scandinavia has been questioned due to the historically high <b>browsing</b> <b>levels.</b> We here review the basic ecology, genetics and life histories of aspen in a browsing context. Browsers can suppress the regeneration of aspen and the relatively short lifespan of the trees result in frequent regeneration cycles and concurrent exposure to browsers. In the long term, browsing may reduce recruitment and delay maturation, increase mortality and ultimately cause a decline of aspen. Norwegian forest inventory data indicate a reduced recruitment rate of young aspen (diameter at breast height; 60 – 79 mm) during the last 25 years, but {{it is unclear whether}} this is all due to browsing. Regeneration may also be hampered by lack of disturbance. Recent genetic studies have shown that aspen may have substantial regeneration by seeds, which allows for effective migration. The main conclusion of this review is that although browsing may affect demography and local abundance of aspen, it is very unlikely to lead to the eradication of the species in Fennoscandia...|$|R

At 11 coppice woodlands in lowland England, coppice compartments were categorised based on their coppicing history (restored versus continuous), low and high overstorey canopy cover, and low and high deer <b>browsing</b> <b>levels.</b> Gross vegetation structure in the years following harvesting was also examined.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} impact of browsers on {{vegetation}} types within the Mapungubwe National Park and specifically whether rocky outcrops or ridges in the park serve as refugia from browsers, particularly elephants. We sampled 80 transects at 20 sites and recorded 1740 plants comprising 65 species. We found that a high proportion (> 80 %) of the woody vegetation sampled indicated browser utilisation. Although certain woody species (e. g. Albizia harveyi, Boscia albitrunca, Lannea schweinfurthii) appeared to be preferred by browsers, <b>browsing</b> <b>levels</b> were relatively high among all woody species. High <b>levels</b> of <b>browsing</b> by herbivores other than elephants suggest {{that they have a}} significant impact on the park’s vegetation. We did not find that rocky ridges acted as refugia to browsers, but instead found that vegetation in rocky ridges was more severely impacted by browsers than vegetation in flat areas, despite vegetation being more accessible in flat areas. If elephant numbers continue to increase at the current rate (e. g. elephant numbers doubled between 2007 and 2010), we predict that some of the heavily utilised species will become locally rare over time. Conservation implications: High <b>levels</b> of <b>browsing</b> by both elephant and smaller herbivores contribute to significant impacts on vegetation away from rivers in Mapungubwe National Park.

We participated to the semantic feature extraction by submitting results to 15 {{out of the}} 17 defined semantic categories. Our approach utilized spatio-temporal visual features based on correlations of quantized gradient edges and color values together with several physical features from the audio signal. Most recent version of our Video Browsing and Retrieval System (VIRE) contains an interactive cluster-temporal browser of video shots exploiting three semantic levels of similarity: visual, conceptual and lexical. The informativeness of the browser was enhanced by incorporating automatic speech transcription texts into the visual views based on shot key frames.

Every level is allocated a unique URL which users can copy and share with other people. When signed into the website with their Sony Entertainment Network account, users may add levels to their 'Queue' enabling them to find the level quickly when they're in the game and connected to the game's servers. If the user is playing LittleBigPlanet 2 and isn't currently in a level a Play Now button becomes available on the website which sends a command back to the game to navigate instantly to the selected level.|$|R
40|$|The Serengeti-Mara savanna {{environment}} in East Africa {{is characterized by}} changing levels of woody cover and a dynamic fire regime. The relative proportion of woodland to grassland savanna affects animal habitat, biodiversity, and carbon storage, and is regulated by {{factors such as the}} fire regime (frequency, intensity, seasonality), and precipitation. The main objectives of this dissertation are to determine recent changes in woody cover at a regional scale and identify fire regimes and climate associated with these changes. Understanding these relationships is important for the assessment of future trajectories of woody cover under changing climate. Required spatially coherent data layers can only be obtained at the regional scale through the analysis of remote sensing data. Woody cover changes between 2000 and 2005 were derived from field data and a time series of MODIS satellite imagery at 500 m spatial resolution. Data layers on the controlling variables (fire frequency, seasonality, intensity and rainfall) were developed using a combination of remote sensing and model-based approaches. Burned areas were mapped using daily MODIS imagery at 250 m resolution. Outputs were used to make the requisite layers depicting fire frequency and seasonality. Fire intensity was derived using a model based on empirical relationships, mainly estimating fire fuel load as a function of rainfall and grazing. The combined data layers were analyzed using regression and decision tree techniques. Results suggest woody cover in central and northern Serengeti National Park continued to increase after 2000. Woody cover decreases were strongest in the wider Maswa Game Reserve area (MSW) under low precipitation conditions and late season burning. Woody cover losses in burned areas were also higher in the low fire frequency region of the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MNR). Fire seasonality was the most important fire regime parameter controlling woody cover in burned woodland savanna areas while fire intensity was most relevant for grassland savanna areas. Continued late season burning in drought years might cause further decrease of woody cover in MSW. MNR is expected to continue to be dominated by grassland savanna at similar fire frequency and <b>browsing</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R
