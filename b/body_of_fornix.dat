40|$|Background and Objective: Evidence from rat and nonhuman primate studies {{indicates}} that axons comprising the fornix have a characteristic topographical organization: projections from the temporal/anterior hippocampus mainly occupy the lateral fornix, whereas the more medial fornix contains fibers from the septal/posterior hippocampus. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate whether the same topographical organization exists in the human brain. Methods: Using high angular resolution diffusion MRI-based tractography at 3 T, subdivisions <b>of</b> the <b>fornix</b> were reconstructed in 40 healthy adults by selecting fiber pathways from either the anterior or the posterior hippocampus. Results: The tract reconstructions revealed that anterior hippocampal fibers predominantly comprise the lateral <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fornix,</b> whereas posterior fibers make up the medial <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fornix.</b> Quantitative analyses support this medial:lateral distinction in humans, which matches the topographical organization <b>of</b> the <b>fornix</b> in other primates. Conclusion: This novel tractography protocol enables the separation <b>of</b> <b>fornix</b> fibers from anterior and posterior hippocampal regions in the human brain and, hence, provides a means by which to compare functions associated with different sets of connections along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe fornix {{connects the}} hippocampal {{formation}} with structures beyond the temporal lobe. Previous tractography studies have typically reconstructed the fornix as one unified bundle. However, the fornix contains two rostral divisions: the precommissural fornix and the postcommissural fornix. Each division has distinct anatomical connections and, hence, potentially distinct functions. Diffusion weighted MRI and spherical deconvolution based tractography {{were employed to}} reconstruct these separate fornix divisions and to examine their microstructural properties in both healthy ageing and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Reliable reconstructions of precommissural and postcommissural fibres were achieved in both groups, with their fibres retaining largely separate locations within the anterior <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fornix.</b> Ageing and MCI had comparable effects on the two segments. Ageing was associated with changes in mean, axial and radial diffusivity but not with alterations of fibre population-specific diffusion properties, estimated with the hindrance modulated orientational anisotropy (HMOA). Individual HMOA variation in postcommissural, but not precommissural, fibres correlated positively (and unrelated to age) with visual recall performance. This provides novel evidence for a role of postcommissural fibres, which connect structures of the extended hippocampal network, in episodic memory function. Separating the fornix into its two principal divisions brings new opportunities for distinguishing different hippocampal networks...|$|R

METHODS AND RESULTS: Neuropsychological evaluations were completed at 10 and 30 weeks post-operatively, and indicated both retrograde and severe anterograde amnesia, as well as persistent depression. At the second evaluation, most cognitive deficits had improved, but memory and mood deficits remained. Metamemory and priming remained intact.

40|$|Diffusion imaging is a {{promising}} marker of microstructural damage in neurodegenerative disorders, but interpretation of {{its relationship with}} underlying neuropathology can be complex. Here, we examined both volumetric and brain microstructure abnormalities in 13 amnestic patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who progressed to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) no earlier than 2 years after baseline scanning, in order to focus on early, and hence more sensitive, imaging markers. We compared them to 22 stable amnestic MCI patients with similar cognitive performance and episodic memory impairment but who did not show progression of symptoms for at least 3 years. Significant group differences were mainly found in the volume and microstructure of the left hippocampus, while white matter group differences were {{also found in the}} <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fornix,</b> left fimbria, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). Diffusion index abnormalities in the SLF were the sign of a subtle microstructural injury not detected by standard atrophy measures in the corresponding gray matter regions.

An optimal prediction model (91 % accuracy, 85 % sensitivity, 96 % specificity) was obtained by combining MRI measures and CSF protein biomarkers. These results highlight the benefit of using the information of brain microstructural damage, in addition to traditional gray matter volume, to detect early, subtle abnormalities in MCI prior to clinical progression to probable AD and, in combination with CSF markers, to accurately predict such progression...|$|R

50|$|The fornix is a C-shaped {{bundle of}} axons that {{begins in the}} hippocampal {{formation}} of both hemispheres, {{referred to as the}} fimbria, and extend through the crus <b>of</b> <b>fornix,</b> also known as the posterior pillars.

First, inter-rater and intrarater reliability measures were determined for both fornix volume and cross-sectional area from a subset of 20 cases (10 patients, 10 controls). The overall volume measure had acceptable levels of reliability.

40|$|We {{have used}} {{anterograde}} and retrograde tracing techniques {{to study the}} development <b>of</b> the postcommissural <b>fornix</b> in albino rats. The fornix reaches the caudal hypothalamus {{a day or two}} before birth. Before fornix axons can be seen entering the mamillary nuclei, a prominent contingent <b>of</b> the <b>fornix</b> can be followed beyond the mamillary bodies. This postmamillary component continues to grow into the midbrain and pontine tegmentum during the first postnatal week as the projection to the mamillary nuclei is being elaborated. During the second and third postnatal weeks, the postmamillary component <b>of</b> the <b>fornix</b> becomes progressively smaller until it is completely eliminated. The cells of origin of this transient postmamillary component <b>of</b> the <b>fornix</b> are found within the subicular complex of the hippocampal region. Most, if not all, of the cells of origin of the postmamillary component <b>of</b> the <b>fornix</b> survive the period during which this projection is eliminated. Consistent with these observations is the interpretation that the axons <b>of</b> the <b>fornix</b> that eventually enter and arborize within the mamillary nuclei and are maintained in the adult, arise during development as interstitial collaterals from parent fibers, the distal portions of which are subsequently eliminated. While not present in adult rats, a postmamillary component <b>of</b> the <b>fornix</b> has been described in other species, such as the cat (Nauta, 1958). It would seem, therefore, that in this case the interspecific variations in projection patterns result from the differential elaboration and elimination of an initially quite similar pattern of connections.

This investigation examined WM structural damage specifically related to hippocampal atrophy in healthy aging subjects (n= 129), using morphological MRI to assess hippocampal volume and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) to assess WM integrity. Subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia were excluded from the analysis. In our sample, increasing age was significantly associated with reduced hippocampal volume and reduced Fractional Anisotropy (FA) at the level <b>of</b> the <b>fornix</b> and the cingulum bundle.

A recursive regression procedure was applied to evaluate sequential relationships between the alterations of these two brain structures. When both hippocampal atrophy and fornix FA values were included in the same model to predict age, fornix FA values remained significant whereas hippocampal atrophy was no longer significantly associated with age.

The hippocampal formation, including the subiculum and presubiculum, together with the entorhinal cortex (EC) and perirhinal cortex (area 35) contribute numerous axons to the fornix in a topographical manner. In contrast, the lateral perirhinal cortex (area 36) and parahippocampal cortical areas TF and TH only contained a handful of cells labeled via the fornix. The medial fornix originates from cells in the caudal half of the subiculum, the lamina principalis interna of the caudal half of the presubiculum, and from the perirhinal cortex (area 35). The intermediate portion <b>of</b> the <b>fornix</b> (i. e., that part midway between the midline and most lateral parts <b>of</b> the <b>fornix)</b> originates from cells in the rostral half of the subiculum and prosubiculum, the anterior presubiculum (only from the lamina principalis externa), the caudal presubiculum (primarily from lamina principalis interna), the rostral half of CA 3, the EC (primarily 28 I and 28 M), and the perirhinal cortex (area 35).

40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is {{the most}} common form of {{neurodegenerative}} dementia. Researchers have long been focused on the cortical pathology of AD, since the most important pathologic features are the senile plaques found in the cortex, and the neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss that begin in the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus. In addition to these gray matter structures, histopathological studies indicate that the white matter is also a good target for both the early diagnosis of AD and for monitoring disease progression. The fornix is a white matter bundle that constitutes a core element of the limbic circuits, and is one of the most important anatomical structures related to memory. Functional and anatomical features <b>of</b> the <b>fornix</b> have naturally captured researchers’ attention as possible diagnostic and prognostic markers of AD. Indeed, neurodegeneration <b>of</b> the <b>fornix</b> has been histologically observed in AD, and growing evidence indicates that the alterations seen in the fornix are potentially a good marker to predict future conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD, and even from cognitively normal individuals to AD.
