50|$|Calender section {{where the}} dried paper is smoothened under high loading and pressure. Only one nip (where the sheet is pressed between two rolls) is {{necessary}} in order to hold the sheet, which shrinks through the drying section and is held in tension between the press section (or <b>breaker</b> <b>stack</b> if used) and the calender. Extra nips give more smoothing but at some expense to paper strength.|$|E
30|$|The {{superconducting magnet}} will store a large {{magnetic}} energy of about 436.6 Â MJ at 56 kA. To avoid the overheating {{from the hot}} spot temperature, an appropriate quench protection is required. The quench protection circuit is composed of the DC power supply, quench detection circuit, coil isolation amplifiers, dump resistor, diode <b>stack,</b> <b>breaker</b> control system, switch control system and emergency dump breakers etc. The quench detection circuit {{will be used to}} monitor the voltage of the superconducting magnet. The high speed DC circuit breakers are used to protect the superconducting coils in case of a quench. The input power will be interrupted by opening the emergency dump circuit breakers.|$|R
