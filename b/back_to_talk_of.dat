We tried {{reading the}} things Mr. Wilmot had marked, {{but she was}} too restless; her hands would wander off to the letters, caressing them, and she would go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> him--all his ways from a baby upwards. I hope there was no harm in letting her do it, for if there is {{anything}} to do one good, it is his noble spirit.' ...|$|E

60|$|He and Bulstrode rode <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Middlemarch together, <b>talking</b> <b>of</b> many things--chiefly cholera and {{the chances}} of the Reform Bill in the House of Lords, and the firm resolve of the {{political}} Unions. Nothing was said about Raffles, except that Bulstrode mentioned the necessity of having a grave for him in Lowick churchyard, and observed that, so far as he knew, the poor man had no connections, except Rigg, whom he had stated to be unfriendly towards him.|$|R

Campion and his friends visit Dr Galley, the local medic, a bizarre, eccentric old man who tries <b>to</b> scare them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> London with <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> a curse on the village. Back at the house, they find a drunken Lugg and Scatty Williams, the Fittons' servant, have caught Peaky Doyle breaking into the house and beaten him up. He had been found looking at the inscription. Campion reveals that he informed Doyle of the inscription in hopes of getting some help solving the riddle, and insists they leave Doyle unconscious on the heath, ...|$|R
6000|$|He hadn't come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{hear her}} <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> his believing in {{her as if}} he didn't; but he had come back--and it all was upon him now--to seize her with a sudden {{intensity}} that her manner of pleading with him had made, as happily appeared, irresistible. He laid strong hands upon her to say, almost in anger, [...] "Do you love me, love me, love me?" [...] and {{she closed her eyes}} as with the sense that he might strike her but that she could gratefully take it. Her surrender was her response, her response her surrender; and, though scarce hearing what she said, he so profited by these things that it could for the time be ever so intimately appreciable to him that he was keeping her. The long embrace in which they held each other was the rout of evasion, and he took from it the certitude that what she had from him was real to her. It was stronger than an uttered vow, and the name he was to give it in afterthought was that she had been sublimely sincere. That was all he asked--sincerity making a basis that would bear almost anything. This settled so much, and settled it so thoroughly, that {{there was nothing left to}} ask her to swear to. Oaths and vows apart, now they could talk. It seemed in fact only now that their questions were put on the table. He had taken up more expressly at the end of five minutes her plea for her own plan, and it was marked that the difference made by the passage just enacted was a difference in favour of her choice of means. Means had somehow suddenly become a detail--her province and her care; it had grown more consistently vivid that her intelligence was one with her passion. [...] "I certainly don't want," [...] he said--and he could say it with a smile of indulgence--"to be all the while bringing it up that I don't trust you." ...|$|R
