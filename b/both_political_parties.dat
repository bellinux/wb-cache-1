However, Florida governor Rick Scott denied the funding in 2011, citing that {{it was still a}} risk due to uncertain ridership estimates and actual construction and maintenance costs, which could have been a burden to taxpayers. Many were disappointed in Scott's vehement denial of the money. 26 Florida senators from <b>both</b> <b>political</b> <b>parties</b> signed a letter to United States Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood encouraging him to ignore Scott's decision, and even former governor Jeb Bush, who was against the previous high-speed rail proposal, was surprised by Scott's actions.

The initiative was developed through a bipartisan bill, the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act, written by U.S. Senators Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Chris Murphy.

500|$|Sarah {{had always}} been jealous of Anne's affection for Abigail Masham, since having learned of it.

All these {{attempts}} failed, even when Anne was threatened with an official parliamentary demand from the Whigs, who were suspicious of Abigail's Tory influence with Anne, for Abigail's dismissal. The whole scenario echoed Anne's refusal to give up Sarah during the reign of William and Mary; but the threat of Parliamentary interference exceeded anything tried against Anne in the 1690s. Anne was ultimately triumphant; she conducted interviews with high-ranking politicians of <b>both</b> <b>political</b> <b>parties</b> and begged them [...] "with tears in her eyes" [...] to oppose the motion. The general view was that the Marlboroughs had made themselves look ridiculous over a trivial matter- since when, it was asked, did Parliament address the Queen on whom she should employ in her bedchamber? ...|$|E

500|$|The {{focus of}} the NWP shifted to {{equality}} under the law, including equal employment opportunities, jury service, nationality for married women and any other provision which legally prohibited women from having full legal equality. In 1923, the Equal Rights Amendment was introduced by Daniel Read Anthony, Jr. and the women pushed for its passage, lobbying for support from <b>both</b> <b>political</b> <b>parties.</b> Stevens served as vice chair of NWP’s New York branch, spearheading the NWP Women for Congress campaign in 1924. Unable to run herself due to her having established a legal residence in France, Stevens worked toward the goal of securing the election of 100 women to Congress in states where female candidates were among contenders for office. The campaign had negligible results and the women shifted back to equality measures. Beginning in 1926, one of the proposals Stevens focused on {{for the next several}} years was the [...] "Wages for Wives" [...] marriage contract.
