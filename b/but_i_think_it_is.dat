There is every reason for expecting a steady and progressive increase in earnings for an indefinite period in the future. I am not in entire accord with the general manager's statement that the business secured from this branch may be replaced from points on our own lines. Contrary to the belief, the supplies of cedar in western Washington are comparatively limited, and the greatest reserves of this timber are {{along the line of}} the Lake Shore. I think it but {{a matter of a few}} years when the cedar will be exhausted on our other lines.|$|E
25|$|In the {{trenches}} of World War One, Johnson's name {{was used by}} British troops to describe the impact of German 150mm heavy artillery shells which had a black colour. In his letters home to his wife, Rupert Edward Inglis (1863–1916), a former rugby international who was a Forces Chaplain, describes passing through the town of Albert: We went through the place today (2 October 1915) where the Virgin Statue {{at the top of}} the Church was hit by a shell in January. The statue was knocked over, but has never fallen, I sent you a picture of it. It really is a wonderful sight. It is incomprehensible how it can have stayed there, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> now lower than when the photograph was taken, and no doubt will come down with the next gale. The Church and village are wrecked, there’s a huge hole made by a Jack Johnson just outside the west door of the Church.|$|E

[...] Crystal said, [...] "I'm a little more optimistic than Harry. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> difficult. Men {{basically}} act like stray dogs in front of a supermarket.

No, I don't have any regrets about my part in {{the invention of the}} airplane, though no one could deplore more than I do the destruction it has caused. I feel about the airplane much the same as I do in regard to fire. That is, I regret all the terrible damage caused by fire, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> good for the human race that someone discovered how to start fires and that we have learned how to put fire to thousands of important uses." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Barrales, {{beyond the}} name, Bonded by Blood {{borrowed}} from Exodus for inspiration everything. [...] "From the guitars being razor-sharp to the drums, the speed. We {{wanted to do}} something that resemble that. Something that is gonna be fast and in-your-face. And what better band than Exodus to be inspired by?" [...] Exodus' lead guitarist Gary Holt says that is a compliment that the band has named themselves after Bonded by Blood. [...] "Could I have imagined that all these years later a band was going to name themselves after our first album? Probably not. It is not like that convention—naming bands after songs—is something new, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> great." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{opposition}} grew in 1688 {{against the}} Catholic King James II, {{the military establishment}} around Portsmouth was controlled by the King's illegitimate son, James FitzJames, the Duke of Berwick. Revolution broke out and for a period Portsmouth and its defences were important to the King as a potential exit route for the Royal Family to France; by late December, however, this route was no longer needed. George Legge, the Baron Dartmouth, pressurised FitzJames to hand over control of Southsea Castle to the Protestant Captain Carter on 18 December and Portsmouth surrendered to the revolution two days later. The traveller Celia Fiennes, who visited the castle in 1690, observed that it was [...] "very fine, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> but of little strength and service." ...|$|E
500|$|Fry and Dickinson flew to New York with promotional {{copies and}} met {{employees}} {{of a number}} of record labels, but could not generate interest in the album. When a similar promotion attempt failed in California, the album was shelved as it was considered not commercial enough for release. Fry recalled, [...] "We'd go in and play it and these guys would look at us like we were crazy". In late 1974, before the album was even named, the band broke up, bringing Big Star's first era to its end. Dickinson later said that he was [...] "nailed for indulging Alex on Big Star Third, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> important that the artist is enabled to perform with integrity. What I did for Alex was literally remove the yoke of oppressive production that he had been under since the first time he ever uttered a word into a microphone, for good or ill." ...|$|E
500|$|I'm {{influenced}} by everything. By books, by the weather, by the water, by my shoes, if they're comfortable or not. Everything. One {{of it is}} music, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> very important {{with people who are}} dealing with making music that they are not only {{influenced by}} music. And I find it very sad when you find a record, and it says on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. And when people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from this artist in there", I read that and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed". But if people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, this made me feel like this and that [...] ", that's right. It should be beyond style, beyond influence, it should be about pure emotion, and real life.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are those}} who say that to kill [...] Martin [...] is terrorism, but to attack an army camp is guerrilla warfare and to bomb civilians is {{professional}} warfare. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the same from the moral point of view. Is it better to drop an atomic bomb on a city than to kill a handful of persons? I don’t think so. But nobody says that President Truman was a terrorist. All the men we went for individually – Wilkin, Martin, MacMichael and others – were personally interested in succeeding in the fight against us.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, {{during his}} {{candidacy}} for the Kansas secretary of state, Kobach said Obama could end {{the controversy over}} his citizenship by producing a “long-form” birth certificate. In the preceding two years, judges had termed such suits [...] "frivolous." [...] These included U.S. District Judge R. Barclay Surrick of Philadelphia, who had thrown out a lawsuit on the issue, saying it {{was a waste of}} the court's time. Kobach said that the certificate released by Obama [...] "doesn't have a doctor's signature on it. ...

2500|$|... "There are two {{languages}} in Brazil.

The latter is the mother tongue of Brazilians, the former has to be learned in school, and a majority of population does not manage to master it appropriately.... Personally, I do not object to us writing Portuguese, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> important to make clear that Portuguese is (at least in Brazil) only a written language. Our mother tongue is not Portuguese, but Brazilian Vernacular. This is not a slogan, nor a political statement, it is simply recognition of a fact.... There are linguistic teams working hard in order to give the full description of the structure of the Vernacular. So, there are hopes, that within some years, we will have appropriate grammars of our mother tongue, the language that has been ignored, denied and despised for such a long time." ...|$|E

[...] They had two children, Gerard Anthony Christian Kirsopp Lake (27 December 19043 September 1972) and Agnes Freda Isabel Kirsopp Lake (31 July 19093 November 1993). [...] It was also during these later years of his curacy that Lake [...] "began to doubt {{the teachings of the}} church and {{to think in terms of}} history and exegesis rather than theology and parish difficulties." [...] As his son reports, my father [...] "has often said that the turning point in his belief in the church came when his Vicar suggested that prayers be said at Vespers for a Mr. Brown, since the doctor had just announced that there was no hope for him. [...] The story may be apocryphal <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> indicative of his point of view." [...] His daughter Agnes, [...] "in conversations, was less polite and oblique: 'Heresy' was her word, pronounced with glee and gusto." [...] This type of thinking may have run in the family, for Lake told Alfred North Whitehead in 1922 that his father, the physician, [...] "being asked late in life what had done the most in his lifetime to relieve human suffering, answered, 'Anaesthesia and the decay of Christian theology.'" ...|$|E

Will you murder your children, your women, yes, destroy your nation to-day?" [...] He stood before them like a statue and the men who held the two policemen helpless paused for an instant. He went on: [...] "You are brave today because you outnumber the white men, but what will you do tomorrow? There are railroads on all sides of you. The soldiers will pour in from every direction by thousands and surround you. You have little food or ammunition. It will be the end of your people. Stop, I say, stop now!" [...] Jack Red Cloud, son of the old chief rushed up to him and thrust a revolver almost in his face. [...] "It is you and men like you," [...] he shouted, [...] "who have reduced our race to slavery and starvation!" [...] American Horse did not flinch but deliberately reentered the office, followed by Jack still flourishing the pistol. But his timely appearance and eloquence had saved the day. Others of the police force had time to reach the spot, and with a large crowd of friendly Indians had taken command of the situation. When I went into the office I found him alone but apparently quite calm. [...] "Where are the agent and the clerks?" [...] I asked. [...] "They fled by the back door," [...] he replied, smiling.
