An effort to characterize the fluid environment upstream {{of the space shuttle}} main engine low-pressure fuel pump was undertaken to help identify the cause of the cracks and also provide quantitative environments and loads of the region.

40|$|Abstract: Most modern {{cars have}} a bellows-type {{flexible}} joint between the manifold and the catalytic converter {{to allow for}} thermal expansion and to decouple large engine movements and vibrations {{from the rest of}} the exhaust system. To obtain better understanding of the influence of this joint, the dynamic response of a typical exhaust system is studied when excited via different joint configurations. Measurements show the great order of reduction in vibration transmission to the exhaust system that a <b>bellows</b> <b>joint,</b> with and without an inside liner, gives in comparison with a stiff joint. For the combined bellows and liner joint, vibration transmission is, however, higher than for the bellows alone. Together with some other aspects this makes the choice of including a liner in the exhaust system application complex. For a system in general the possibility of tuning the friction limit of the liner, to minimize overall vibrations through friction-based damping, depends on how close to ideal the excitation source is and its location. Anyhow, the combined bellows and liner joint makes the exhaust system behaviour significantly non-linear, whereas the system behaviour proves to be essentially linear when the bellows has no liner, which imply that the liner needs to be included in theoretical models when present in the real system...|$|E

40|$|A 3 D remote {{metrology}} system (RMS) {{is needed to}} map the interior plasma-facing components of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The performance and survival of these components within the reactor vessel are strongly dependent on their precise alignment and positioning {{with respect to the}} plasma edge. Without proper positioning and alignment, plasma-facing surfaces will erode rapidly. A RMS design involving Coleman Research Corporation (CRC) fiber optic coherent laser radar (CLR) technology is examined in this study. The fiber optic CLR approach was selected because its high precision should be able to meet the ITER 0. 1 mm accuracy requirement and because the CLR`s fiber optic implementation allows a 3 D scanner to operate remotely from the RMS system`s vulnerable components. This design study has largely verified that a fiber optic CLR based RMS can survive the ITER environment and map the ITER interior at the required accuracy at a one measurement/cm{sup 2 } density with a total measurement time of less than one hour from each of six or more vertically deployed measurement probes. The design approach employs a sealed and pressurized measurement probe which is attached with an umbilical spiral bellows conduit. This conduit bears fiber optic and electronic links plus a stream of air to lower the temperature in the interior of the probe. Lowering the probe temperature is desirable because probe electromechanical components which could survive the radiation environment often were not rated for the 200 C temperature. The tip of the probe whose outer shell has a flexible <b>bellows</b> <b>joint</b> can swivel in two degrees of freedom to allow mapping operations at each probe deployment level.

40|$|The {{history of}} {{particle}} colliders {{begins in the}} early 60 's when an idea previously patented by R. Wideroe in 1953 is constructed. The design of the vacuum chamber in their experimental area became essential {{as it was the}} rst physical barrier that the particles to be detected needed to traverse. The interaction of the products of the collisions with the vacuum chamber structural materials, hindered the identification of the significative events. This Thesis analyses the historical evolution of the experimental vacuum chambers and summarizes the technical criteria that are to be fulfilled. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) presently under construction at CERN is the last generation of particle colliders. Four big experiments will be in operation (ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb) in the LHC with diferent physics objectives. In particular, LHCb will be devoted to the study of CP violation and the design of its vacuum chamber is the scope of this Thesis. Physics simulations with an initial design consisting of a conical aluminium vacuum chamber with stainless steel flanges and <b>bellows</b> expansion <b>joints,</b> foresaw redundancies in the experiment detection channels that would make it inefficient. The reduction of the radiation background generated after the interactions of the products of the proton collisions with the vacuum chamber materials became essential. Berillium became the ideal candidate as structural material for the vacuum chamber due to its excellent mechanical properties and high transparency to radiation. Nonetheless, its toxicity, difficult machining and complicated weld hampers its use. TIG welding of beryllium to beryllium and to aluminium AA 2219 was qualified for UHV applications as per ISO Norms applicable for aluminium welding. On the other hand, beryllium high price led to consider beryllium-aluminium composites for the fabrication of the LHCb vacuum chamber. The mechanical characterization of the berylliumaluminium HIP AlBeMet AM 162 at the required bakeout temperatures of 200 °C and 250 °C was completed. In turn, the electron beam welding of beryllium-aluminium to beryllium-aluminium and to aluminium AA 2219 was qualified for UHV applications following ISO Norms applicable for aluminium welding. Once characterized mechanically the materials and demonstrated the feasibility of the welding, nite element analysis were performed to design the vacuum chamber; as well as to design other special components integrated in it. The fabrication and thorough tests conducted with prototypes is described; in particular, an aluminium AA 6061 OD 860 mm window 2 mm thick that UHV seals one of the detectors, two <b>bellows</b> expansion <b>joint</b> aluminium fabricated in AA 2219 and two optimized aluminium AA 2219 UHV anges.

Such a low percentage leads to a very compact design of systems and sub-systems situated in the interconnections, like the mechanical compensation system, composed of the <b>bellows</b> expansion <b>joints,</b> that have to compensate for the thermal contraction of the magnets. Given the complexity of the LHC interconnections, the requirements concerning their reliability were considerably increased since the availability of the collider for physics cannot be compromised.

40|$|To achieve {{maximum beam}} {{energy in the}} LHC the {{accumulated}} length of the interconnections between LHC main magnets has been limited to around 3 % of the total magnetic length in the Arcs and Dispersion Suppressors.

These components have been optimised to ensure high reliability standards required for the LHC. Nevertheless, initial damage can occur and lead to a premature fatigue failure.

40|$|A {{majority}} of the thin-walled components subjected to intensive plastic straining at cryogenic temperatures are made of stainless steels. The examples of such components {{can be found in}} the interconnections of particle accelerators, containing the superconducting magnets, where the thermal contraction is absorbed by thin-walled, axisymetric shells called <b>bellows</b> expansion <b>joints.</b> The stainless steels show three main phenomena induced by plastic strains at cryogenic temperatures: serrated (discontinuous) yielding, gamma->alpha' phase transformation and anisotropic ductile damage. In the present paper, a coupled constitutive model of gamma->alpha' phase transformation and orthotropic ductile damage is presented. A kinetic law of phase transformation, and a kinetic law of evolution of orthotropic damage are presented. The model is extended to anisotropic plasticity comprising a constant anisotropy (texture effect), which can be classically taken into account by the Hill yield surface, and plastic strain induced anisotropy. For such a model the shape of the yield surface in the stress space varies as a function of the plastic strains.

40|$|The Fe-Cr-Ni {{stainless}} steels {{are well known}} for their ductile behaviour at cryogenic temperatures. This implies development and evolution of plastic strain fields in the stainless steel components subjected to thermo-mechanical loads at low temperatures. The evolution of plastic strain fields is usually associated with two phenomena: ductile damage and strain induced martensitic transformation. Ductile damage is described by the kinetic law of damage evolution. Here, the assumption of isotropic distribution of damage (microcracks and microvoids) in the Representative Volume Element (RVE) is made. Formation of the plastic strain induced martensite (irreversible process) leads {{to the presence of}} quasi-rigid inclusions of martensite in the austenitic matrix. The amount of martensite platelets in the RVE depends on the intensity of the plastic strain fields and on the temperature. The evolution of the volume fraction of martensite is governed by a kinetic law based on the accumulated plastic strain. Both of these irreversible phenomena, associated with the dissipation of plastic power, are included into the constitutive model of {{stainless steels}} at cryogenic temperatures.

40|$|The present {{paper is}} focused on {{constitutive}} modelling and identification of parameters of the relevant model of plastic strain- induced martensitic transformation in austenitic stainless steels at low temperatures. The model {{used to describe the}} FCCrightward arrow BCC phase transformation in austenitic stainless steels {{is based on the assumption}} of linearization of the most intensive part of the transformation curve. The kinetics of phase transformation is described by three parameters: transformation threshold (p/sub xi/), slope (A) and saturation level (xi/sub L/). It is assumed that the phase transformation is driven by the accumulated plastic strain p. In addition, the intensity of plastic deformation is strongly coupled to the phase transformation via the description of mixed kinematic /isotropic linear plastic hardening based on the Mori-Tanaka homogenization. The theory of small strains is applied. Small strain fields, corresponding to phase transformation, are decomposed into the volumic and the shear parts. The grade AISI 316 L, stainless steel often used in cryogenic applications, has been chosen as a good example of the austenitic structure. The magnetic permeability of fine gauge stainless steel sheets (thickness 0. 15 - 0. 25 mm) subjected to monotonic straining was measured as a function of strain. The detailed methodology of relevant measurements is presented in the paper. Tuning of the constitutive model is described and the relevant parameters are identified.

The aim of this thesis is to provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} dynamics of automobile exhaust systems to form a basis for improved design and the development of a computationally inexpensive theoretical system model. Modelling, simulation and experimental investigation of a typical exhaust system are performed to gain such an understanding and to evaluate modelling ideas. Special attention is given to the influence of the bellows-type flexible joint on the dynamics of the exhaust system. The investigations show that the exhaust system is essentially linear downstream of the flexible joint. Highly simplified finite element models of the major components within this part are suggested. These models incorporate adjustable flexibility in their connection to the exhaust pipes and a procedure is developed for automatic updating of these parameters to obtain better correlation with experimental results. The agreement between the simulation results of the updated models and the experimental results is very good, which confirms the usability of these models. Furthermore, the investigations show the great reduction of vibration transmission to the exhaust system that the bellows-type joint, either with or without an inside liner, gives in comparison with a stiff joint. For the combined <b>bellows</b> and liner <b>joint,</b> vibration transmission is, however, higher than for the bellows alone. Inclusion of the liner also makes the exhaust system behaviour significantly non-linear and complex, whereas the system behaviour proves to be essentially linear when the joint has no liner. This shows the importance of including a model of the liner in the theoretical system model when the liner is present in the real system. The choice of whether or not to include a liner in the real system is obviously a complex issue. The advantages of reduced bellows temperature and improved flow conditions should be weighed against the disadvantages found in this work. By combining the above findings it is concluded that in coming studies of how engine vibrations affect the exhaust system, the latter may be considered as a linear system if the flexible joint consists of a <b>bellows.</b> If the <b>joint</b> also includes a liner, the system may be considered as a linear subsystem that is excited via a non-linear joint...|$|R
40|$|Demands on {{emission}} control, and low vibration {{and noise}} levels {{have made the}} design of automobile exhaust systems a much more complex task {{over the last few}} decades. This, combined with increasing competition in the automobile industry, has rendered physical prototype testing impractical as the main support for design decisions. The aim of this thesis is to provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} dynamic characteristics of automobile exhaust system components to form a basis for improved design and the development of computationally inexpensive theoretical component models. Modelling, simulation and experimental investigation of a typical exhaust system are performed to gain such an understanding and evaluate ideas of component modelling. Modern cars often have a gas-tight bellows-type flexible joint between the manifold and the catalytic converter. This joint is given special attention since it is the most complex component from a dynamics point of view and because it is important for reducing transmission of engine movements to the exhaust system. The joint is non-linear if the bellows consists of multiple plies or if it includes an inside liner. The first non-linearity is shown to be weak and may therefore be neglected. The non-linearity due to friction in the liner is, however, highly significant and gives the joint complex dynamic characteristics. This is important to know of and consider in exhaust system design and proves the necessity of including a model of the liner in the theoretical joint model when this type of liner is present in the real joint to be simulated. It is known from practice and introductory investigations that also the whole system sometimes shows complex dynamic behaviour. This can be understood from the non-linear characteristics of the flexible joint shown in this work. An approach to the modelling of the combined <b>bellows</b> and liner <b>joint</b> is suggested and experimentally verified. It is shown that the exhaust system is essentially linear downstream of this joint. Highly simplified finite element models of the components within this part are suggested.

These flowliners exist to ensure favorable flow of liquid hydrogen over gimble <b>joint</b> <b>bellows,</b> and consist of two rings each containing 38 elongated slots. In the summer of 2002, multiple cracks ranging from 0. 1 inches to 0. 6 inches long were discovered; each orbiter contained at least one cracked flowliner. These long cracks were repaired and eddy current inspections ensured that no cracks longer than 0. 075 inches were present. However, subsequent fracture-mechanics review of flight rationale required detection of smaller cracks, and was the driving force for development of higher-resolution inspection method. Acetate tape surface replicas {{have been used for}} decades to detect and monitor small cracks. However, acetate tape replicas have primarily been limited to laboratory specimens because complexities involved in making these replicas - requiring acetate tape to be dissolved with acetone - are not well suited for a crack inspection tool. More recently developed silicon-based replicas are better suited for use as a crack detection tool. A commercially available silicon-based replica product has been determined to be acceptable for use in SSME hydrogen feedlines.
