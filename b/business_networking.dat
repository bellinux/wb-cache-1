[...] In the essay [...] "Librarians, Professionalism and Image: Stereotype and Reality" [...] (2007), Abigail Luthmann views the character less favorably, stating that [...] "he unassuming role of librarian is used as a low-visibility disguise for her crime-fighting alter-ego, and while her information-locating skills may have been useful to her extra-curricular activities no direct examples are given." [...] Unlike her earlier incarnation as Batgirl, [...] "s Oracle, Barbara Gordon is arguably the first true librarian-as-super-hero yet seen in a mainstream comic book (as opposed to a super-hero who happens to be a librarian in his/her private life)." [...] Wendi Arant and Candace R.

[...] Using Barbara Gordon in her role as Oracle, author Sean Wise asserts her character as a model for <b>business</b> <b>networking.</b> In How to Be a Business Superhero: Prepare for Everything, Train with the Best, Make Your Own Destiny at Work (2008) he states that [...] "ver the last decade, Oracle has shown the power of a strong network of contacts, and in doing so she shows Business Superheroes the importance of cultivating contacts and developing assets that can further their collective goals." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{economic}} prosperity, the Israeli economy faces many challenges, {{some are}} short term {{and some are}} long term challenges. On the short term its inability to duplicate its success in the telecommunication industry into other growing industries hampers its economic outlooks. Its inability to foster large multinational companies {{in the last decade}} also calls into question its ability to employ large numbers of people in advanced industries. On the long term, Israel is facing challenges of high dependency of the growing number of Ultra-Orthodox Jews who have a low level of official labor force participation amongst men, and this situation could lead to a materially lower employment-to-population ratio and a higher dependency ratio in the future. The governor of the Bank of Israel, Stanley Fischer, stated that the growing poverty amongst the Ultra-Orthodox is hurting the Israeli economy. According to the data published by Ian Fursman, 60% of the poor households in Israel are of the Haredi Jews and the Israeli Arabs. Both groups together represent 25–28% of the Israeli population. [...] Organizations such as The Kemach Foundation, Gvahim, Jerusalem Village and The Jerusalem <b>Business</b> <b>Networking</b> Forum are addressing these challenges with job placement services and networking events.|$|E
