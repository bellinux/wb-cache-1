40|$|A novel group 1 {{coronavirus}} {{was previously}} identified in <b>bent-winged</b> <b>bats</b> (Miniopterus spp.). Here, results are described from our ongoing surveillance of these bats for coronaviruses. These {{findings show that}} group 1 coronaviruses are endemic in these bat populations in Hong Kong. Genetic analysis of these viruses indicates that {{there are at least}} four different, but closely related, group 1 coronaviruses (bat-CoV 1 A, 1 B, HKU 7 and HKU 8) circulating in <b>bent-winged</b> <b>bats.</b> Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these group 1 bat coronaviruses have descended from a common ancestor and that these viruses have been established in these bats {{for a long period of}} time. These data provide a better understanding of the emergence and evolution of coronaviruses. Bat-CoV 1 A and 1 B were detected in apparently healthy Miniopterus magnater and Miniopterus pusillus, respectively, on repeated sampling occasions at a single habitat, suggesting that these viruses have established a persistent infection in these populations. Coronaviruses are a group of enveloped, single-stranded RNA, positive-strand viruses with a corona-like morph-ology (Gorbalenya et al., 2006). Based on antigenic and genetic analyses, coronaviruses can be subdivided into thre...|$|R

50|$|Miniopterus (<b>bent-winged</b> <b>bat,</b> long winged bat) is {{the only}} genus of bats in the family Miniopteridae. The genus {{had been placed in}} its own {{subfamily}} among vesper bats, Miniopterinae, but is now classified as its own family.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bent-winged</b> <b>bats</b> are {{typically}} small (total length c. 10 cm, wingspans 30-35 cm, mass less than 20 g), with broad, short muzzles. The cranium is bulbous and {{taller than the}} snout, a feature shared with woolly bats and mouse-eared bats. This combination of features was likely present in the common ancestor of the vesper bats. They have two tiny, vestigial premolars between the upper canines and first large premolar. Unlike other bats, they lack a tendon-locking mechanism in their toes.|$|R

A capture survey of <b>bent-winged</b> <b>bats</b> {{was carried out}} at Senzyojiki cave, Shirahama-Cho, Wakayama Prefecture on 13 ^ of July, 2003. Captured 156 bats were all female, and 155 bats {{of them seemed to}} be suckling. The ten bats (6. 41 %) of 156 had the bat-ring that we had put at the cave in Shimokitayama-Mura in 2000. The interval estimates of the ratio on 95 % confidence limit seemed to be 2. 57 % to 10. 25 %. Counting of the bat number at the entrance of the Shirahama cave showed about 20, 000 bats inhabited in the cave in July 2003. From ratios of the interval estimates, the population of the females from the Shimokitayama-Mura cave was seemed to be from 514 to 2, 050 bats.

40|$|Due to a {{morphological}} uniformity typically {{shown by}} <b>bent-winged</b> <b>bats,</b> the taxonomic recognition of species and subspecies within the sole genus Miniopterus {{has been much}} questioned and revised. The situation and definition of the African species M. minor is particularly confused. This species is known from scattered and discontinuous records on both mainland coasts, Madagascar, Sno Tomé and Grand Comoro islands. The island forms have been included either within M. minor or considered as endemic species. To clarify their taxonomy, we compare mitochondrial DNA sequences of all the island forms with other related African Miniopterus. The genetic distances {{found in this study}} support a taxonomic recognition of the island forms at species level and the phylogenetic reconstructions based on these data suggest that the M. minor, as considered traditionally, is not a monophyletic group.

5000|$|The {{existence}} of paleontological and archaeological findings point towards {{the use of}} the cave as a human and an animal habitat, alternatively. The finds include bones of herbivore and carnivore mammals, marine and freshwater molluscs, microfauna as well as artifacts like potsherds, knives on flint, oldowans, choppers and hammerstones on quartzite, as well as manuports. The wide variety of prehistoric faunal specimens belong to bones of herbivore mammals such as cave bears (Ursus deningeri), horses (Equus caballus), wild boars (Sus scrofa), fallow deer (Dama dama), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), deer (Megaloceros), cattle (Bos/Bison), antilopes (Gazella), goats (Capra), and carnivores such as wolves and dogs (Canis), foxes (Vulpes), tigers (Panthera), cats (Felis) and hyenas (Crocuta). Findings of [...] "more than 5000 fossil bones and teeth of cave and brown bears", which provide some chronological indicators, led to their extensive scientific study.

40|$|Abstract Background Various {{mechanisms}} such as geographic {{barriers and}} glacial episodes {{have been proposed}} as determinants of intra-specific and inter-specific differentiation of populations, {{and the distribution of}} their genetic diversity. More recently, habitat and climate differences, and corresponding adaptations {{have been shown to be}} forces influencing the phylogeographic evolution of some vertebrates. In this study, we examined the contribution of these various factors on the genetic differentiation of the <b>bent-winged</b> <b>bat,</b> Miniopterus schreibersii, in southeastern Europe and Anatolia. Results and conclusion Our results showed differentiation in mitochondrial DNA coupled with weaker nuclear differentiation. We found evidence for restriction of lineages to geographical areas for hundreds of generations. The results showed that the most likely ancestral haplotype was restricted to the same geographic area (the Balkans) for at least 6, 000 years. We were able to delineate the migration routes during the population expansion process, which followed the coasts and the inland for different nested mitochondrial clades. Hence, we were able to describe a scenario showing how multiple biotic and abiotic events including glacial periods, climate and historical dispersal patterns complemented each other in causing regional and local differentiation within a species. </p...|$|E
40|$|A new {{tentative}} lyssavirus, Lleida bat lyssavirus, {{was found}} in a <b>bent-winged</b> <b>bat</b> (Miniopterus schreibersii) in Spain. It does not belong to phylogroups I or II, {{and it seems to be}} more closely related to the West Causasian bat virus, and especially to the Ikoma lyssavirus. Bats have been considered natural hosts of a wide diversity of viruses, including human pathogens such as lyssaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, henipavirus, and filoviruses (1). Within the genus Lyssavirus, 12 species have been described: Rabies virus (RABV), Lagos bat virus (LBV), Mokola virus (MOKV), Duvenhage virus (DUVV), European bat lyssavirus types 1 and 2 (EBLV- 1 and- 2), Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), Aravan virus (ARAV), Khujand virus (KHUV), Irkut virus (IRKV), West Causasian bat virus (WCBV), and Shimoni bat virus (SHIBV). Two more recently described viruses have not yet been classified: Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV) (2) and Ikoma lyssavirus (IKOV) (3). Bats are the natural reservoirs for most lyssaviruses, and to our knowledge, only MOKV and IKOV have never been detected in bats. RABV is the only virus known to establish epidemiologic cycles in bats and carnivores, and it is responsible for most human infections, mainly transmitted by dogs.

40|$|Parasite {{population}} structure is often {{thought to be}} largely shaped by that of its host. In {{the case of a}} parasite with a complex life cycle, two host species, each with their own patterns of demography and migration, spread the parasite. However, the {{population structure}} of the parasite is predicted to resemble only that of the most vagile host species. In this study, we tested this prediction {{in the context of a}} vector-transmitted parasite. We sampled the haemosporidian parasite Polychromophilus melanipherus across its European range, together with its bat fly vector Nycteribia schmidlii and its host, the <b>bent-winged</b> <b>bat</b> Miniopterus schreibersii. Based on microsatellite analyses, the wingless vector, and not the bat host, was identified as the least structured population and should therefore be considered the most vagile host. Genetic distance matrices were compared for all three species based on a mitochondrial DNA fragment. Both host and vector populations followed an isolation-by-distance pattern across the Mediterranean, but not the parasite. Mantel tests found no correlation between the parasite and either the host or vector populations. We therefore found no support for our hypothesis; the parasite population structure matched neither vector nor host. Instead, we propose a model where the parasite's gene flow is represented by the added effects of host and vector dispersal patterns...|$|E
