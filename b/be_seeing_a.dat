500|$|Well, I didn’t {{know how}} long the comic book series was going to last. I hoped that it would become a success and survive for years and years. But {{at that time in}} my career, it was very early, I had had a lot of books canceled, just because of poor sales. So early on in the book I would move past storylines very quickly. I set up this love {{triangle}} and I resolved that story and moved along within the first [...] issues. But there's a lot of story potential to mine there. One {{of the things that the}} TV show is able to do is to look at the comic book series with hindsight and go, 'This would probably be something that we could explore more.' And that's what we're going to be doing. So we'll <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>a</b> lot more of the Lori-Shane-Rick love triangle.|$|E
2500|$|Morey {{successfully}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Sonya and joined the cast in June 2009 in a recurring capacity. Morey made her first screen appearance as Sonya during the episode broadcast on 14 August 2009. The show's producers noticed the chemistry between Moloney and Morey's characters, and Morey was promoted to the regular cast a year later. A writer for Holy Soap said that viewers would <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>a</b> lot more of Sonya in the future. In February 2011, Morey signed a new contract to stay with Neighbours for another year. She told the Daily Star, [...] "It was great to know I'd be working for a year – from a struggling actor's point of view that is fantastic. But it also meant there is a year's worth of developing the character because she will become part of the bigger storylines instead of supporting." [...] Morey added that she was loving her time on the show and the people she was working with.|$|E

2500|$|Steve Molks, who interviewed them, said, [...] "Speaking {{with them}} you learn very quickly that they aren't just 'presenters' who turn up for filming and that's it; they're gamers of note {{in their own}} right and spend hours playing to review games {{thoroughly}} and log footage for the show, as well as editing and pre-recording for the show". Invalid Channel said [...] "you can really tell that they've taken all of the footage themselves, it's not one-sided stock footage from the developing company. The hosts really play the games themselves and it shows, but you know that you're getting a real opinion from someone who played the game and know exactly how it handles and how annoying all those bugs are, not two people reading straight from some sort of rigid script." [...] He adds that [...] "being on a non-commercial network helps too" [...] as if the show was on a commercial network it may be more successful, but its credibility would be lost as [...] "once the game companies start paying sponsorship, you'd <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>a</b> lot of 10/10's {{and a whole lot of}} kiss-ass".|$|E
