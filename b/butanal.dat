40|$|Abstract The {{biological}} {{removal of}} ammonia and <b>butanal</b> in contaminated air was investigated by using, respectively, a laboratory-scale filter and a scrubber-filter combination. It was shown that ammonia {{can be removed}} with an elimination efficiency of 83 % at a volumetric load of 100 m 3 ·m– 2 ·h– 1 with 4 – 16 [*]ppm of ammonia. During the experiment percolates were analysed for nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and pH. It {{was found that the}} nitrification in the biofilter could deteriorate due to an inhibition of Nitrobacter species, when the free ammonia concentration was rising in the percolate. It should be easy to control such inhibition through periodic analysis of the liquid phase by using a filter-scrubber combination. Such a combination was studied for <b>butanal</b> removal. <b>Butanal</b> was removed with an elimination efficiency of 80 % by a scrubber-filter combination at a volumetric load of 100 m 3 ·m– 2 ·h– 1 and a high <b>butanal</b> input concentration. Mixing the filter material with CaCO 3 and pH[*]control of the liquid in the scrubber resulted in an increase of the elimination efficiency.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess {{component}} interaction in the perception of the 2 aldehydes <b>butanal</b> and heptanal when presented in binary mixtures to rats. A further aim was to develop a behavioral paradigm for testing suppression of com-ponents in mixtures using rodent subjects. Thirsty rats were initially trained to discriminate between the 2 aldehydes <b>butanal</b> and heptanal in an olfactometer using a go/no-go discrimination task. This involved rats learning to place their noses in a sniff port where odors were presented and to lick a tube for water reward when one of the aldehydes was presented (S+) while with-holding licking at the tube to the other, unrewarded, aldehyde (S). A mixture condition was then introduced into the task, whereby a proportion of trials involved presentation of a combination of the 2 aldehydes as an additional unrewarded condition. Rats readily learned to withhold licking on trials when the mixture was presented. The concentration of the nonrewarded (S) aldehyde in the mixture was then systematically decreased, whereas the concentration of the S+ component was held constant. This eventually caused the S+ component in the mixture to suppress detection of the S, as shown by an increasing number of lick responses (false alarms) on trials when the mixture was presented. These suppressing effects occurred well above the detection threshold for the S aldehyde presented alone. Results showed asymmetric suppression in the mixture condition such that <b>butanal</b> suppressed detection of heptanal at much lower concentrations than vice versa. A second experiment showed that when both <b>butanal</b> and heptanal were present in a binary mixture at the same concentration (106 volume %), then rat...|$|E

The single, most inhibitory VOC against germination and seedling formation was oct- 1 -en- 3 -one, an eight carbon ketone that has been isolated from both molds and mushrooms (Jelen and Wasowicz [1998]).
