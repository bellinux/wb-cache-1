5|$|All four stable halogens {{experience}} intermolecular van der Waals {{forces of}} attraction, and their strength increases together with number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic halogen molecules. Thus, the melting and boiling points of <b>bromine</b> are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. As {{a result of}} the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group, the density and heats of fusion and vaporisation of <b>bromine</b> are again intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine, although all their heats of vaporisation are fairly low (leading to high volatility) thanks to their diatomic molecular structure. The halogens darken in colour as the group is descended: fluorine is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and <b>bromine</b> is a reddish-brown volatile liquid that melts at −7.2°C and boils at 58.8°C. (Iodine is a shiny black solid.) This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group. Specifically, the colour of a halogen, such as <b>bromine,</b> results from the electron transition between the highest occupied antibonding πg molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding σu molecular orbital. The colour fades at low temperatures, so that solid <b>bromine</b> at −195°C is pale yellow.|$|E

Several ligands were successful in the synthesis, including 2, 2 ’-bipyridine (bpy), 4, 4 ’-dimethyl- 2, 2 ’-dipyridyl (dmb), 1, 10 -phenanthroline (phen), 4, 7 -diphenyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline (dpphen), and 3, 4, 7, 8 -tetramethyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline (tmphen). Ligands that did not react to form symmetric dimeric complexes were 2, 2 ’-bipyrazine, bpz, and 2, 2 ’-bipyrimidine, bpm. Dpp, 2, 3 -bis(2 -pyridyl) -pyrazine, effectively replaced diphen as the bridging ligand to produce (phen) 2 Ru(dpp) Ru(phen) 24 +. However, replacing the [Ru(CO) 2 Cl 2]n with Ru(DMSO) 4 Cl 2 did not prove successful. The newly developed synthesis was also applied to the synthesis of monomeric complexes with the form Ru(phen) L 2 for comparison. The spectroscopic and electrochemical data collected for the dimeric complexes was similar to the data for the monomeric complexes indicating that the dimers are weakly coupled. The photochemistry of the complexes was then studied to confirm that the dimers were weakly coupled. UV-vis tracking of the reaction of (phen) 2 Ru(diphen) Ru(phen) 24 + implied a photosubstitution reaction took place in which a phen ligand was replaced by <b>bromines.</b> Several failed attempts were made to replace the <b>bromines</b> with a ligand that would allow the complex to be analyzed via ESI-MS. The photosubstitution products were never identified. The photoredox reactions for the complexes were investigated as well.

The kq values found for Ru(bpy) 32 +, Ru(phen) (bpy) 22 +, and (bpy) 2 Ru(diphen) Ru(bpy) 24 + were all comparable. This supports the classification of the dimeric complexes used in this study as weakly coupled. The back reaction that follows the quenching reaction and the yield of the oxidized ruthenium complexes were studied. The determined kback values for both quenchers, Fe 3 + and Cu 2 +, were in the expected range and similar among both the monomers and dimers.
