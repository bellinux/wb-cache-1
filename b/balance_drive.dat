40|$|This paper investigates to {{what extent}} the {{principles}} of structural <b>balance</b> <b>drive</b> the formation of a dual social structure that encompasses collaboration and conflict among corporate actors. Our findings are threefold. First, we find that existing collaborative or conflictual relationships between two companies perpetuate future relationships of the same type, but crowd out relationships of the different type. This results in (1) an increased likelihood of formation of balanced (uniplex) relationships that combine multiple ties of either collaboration or conflict and (2) a reduced likelihood of formation of unbalanced (multiplex) relationships that combine collaboration and conflict between the same two firms. Second, we find that whereas the network’s formation is not driven by a pull toward balanced triads, it is described by a pull away from unbalanced triads. Third and finally, we find that the observed micro-level dynamics of dyads and triads reproduce the structural segregation of the global network into two separate collaborative and conflictual segments of firms. For our empirical analyses, we used data on the dual interorganizational network of strategic partnerships and patent-infringement and antitrust lawsuits in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals from 1996 to 2006...|$|E

The main goal is to automatically and transparently maximize system utilization by balancing the workload at run-time. To achieve this, we have implemented a process migration tool (PMT) which uses diffusion based schemes to equally balance the load. The balancing strategies can be expressed as Poisson operators on a graph. The analysis of the corresponding eigenvalues delivers the convergence speed. Experimentations on Transputer networks (16 to 64 processors) show efficiencies of 90 % and above for varying parameters such {{as the number of}} processes (tasks), the network (hardware) topology, load balancing graph and load balancing strategies. The experimental investigations are shown to confirm the theoretical results of the load balancing strategy analysis...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{explanations}} of balanced lines assume symmetric (antiphase) signals {{but this is}} an unfortunate confusion—signal symmetry and balanced lines are quite independent of each other. Essential in a balanced line is matched impedances in the driver, line and receiver. These conditions ensure that external noise affects each leg of the differential line equally and thus appears as a common mode signal that is removed by the receiver. There are <b>balanced</b> <b>drive</b> circuits that have excellent common-mode impedance matching between [...] "legs" [...] but do not provide symmetric signals. [...] Symmetric differential signals exist to prevent interference to other circuits - the electromagnetic fields are canceled out by the equal and opposite currents.

Migration and conservation efforts cross national boundaries and are subject to numerous international agreements and treaties.

40|$|The {{motility}} {{of a fish}} keratocyte on a flat substrate exhibits {{two distinct}} regimes: the non-migrating and the migrating one. In both configurations the shape is fixed in time and, when the cell is moving, the velocity is constant in magnitude and direction. Transition from a stable configuration to the other one can be produced by a mechanical or chemotactic perturbation. In order {{to point out the}} mechanical nature of such a bistable behaviour, we focus on the actin dynamics inside the cell using a minimal mathematical model. While the protein diffusion, recruitment and segregation govern the polarization process, we show that the free actin mass <b>balance,</b> <b>driven</b> by diffusion, and the polymerized actin retrograde flow, regulated by the active stress, are sufficient ingredients to account for the motile bistability. The length and velocity of the cell are predicted {{on the basis of the}} parameters of the substrate and of the cell itself.

40|$|An ambitious {{challenge}} in artificial {{life is to}} craft an evolutionary process that discovers a wide diversity of welladapted virtual creatures within a single run. Unlike in nature, evolving creatures in virtual worlds tend to converge to a single morphology because selection therein greedily rewards the morphology that is easiest to exploit. However, novelty search, a technique that explicitly rewards diverging, can potentially mitigate such convergence. Thus in this paper an existing creature evolution platform is extended with multi-objective search that <b>balances</b> <b>drives</b> for both novelty and performance. However, there are different ways to combine performance-driven search and novelty search. The suggested approach is to provide evolution with both a novelty objective that encourages diverse morphologies and a local competition objective that rewards individuals outperforming those most similar in morphology. The results in an experiment evolving locomoting virtual creatures show that novelty search with local competition discovers more functional morphological diversity within a single run than models with global competition, which are more predisposed to converge. The conclusions are that novelty search with local competition may complement recent advances in evolving virtual creatures and may in general be a principled approach to combining novelty search with pressure to achieve...|$|R
40|$|The {{transfer}} {{of energy and}} water, as well as gaseous components, in the soil&# 8211;plant&# 8211;atmosphere system {{plays a crucial role}} in many processes involved in climate change. The surface energy <b>balance</b> <b>drives</b> both evapotranspiration (closely linked to the CO 2 flux) and sensible heat flux. By providing direct information on heat dissipation efficiency, surface temperature appears to be a key variable. In particular, a lot of work has been conducted on estimating evapotranspiration from thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing measurements, in order to derive information relevant to agriculture (monitoring plant growth, detection of water stress, crop yield forecasting, etc.) or hydrology (water cycle monitoring, catchment water budget, etc.). This chapter first very succinctly presents the relationship between surface temperature and the surface energy balance, providing the reader with reference publications for further reading. This is followed by a review of the data available in the thermal infrared (TIR) domain and an analysis of various sources of uncertainty affecting surface temperature measurements and their impact on the final accuracy. The different methods for estimating and spatializing actual evapotranspiration (AET) are then discussed. Finally, practical applications of TIR information other than AET are briefly mentioned...|$|R

40|$|We {{proposed}} that spindle morphogenesis in Drosophila embryos involves progression through four transient isometric structures {{in which a}} constant spacing of the spindle poles is maintained by a balance of forces generated by multiple microtubule (MT) motors and that tipping this <b>balance</b> <b>drives</b> pole-pole separation. Here we used fluorescent speckle microscopy to evaluate the influence of MT dynamics on the isometric state that persists through metaphase and anaphase A and on pole-pole separation in anaphase B. During metaphase and anaphase A, fluorescent punctae on kinetochore and interpolar MTs flux toward the poles at 0. 03 μm/s, too slow to drive chromatid-to-pole motion at 0. 11 μm/s, and during anaphase B, fluorescent punctae on interpolar MTs {{move away from the}} spindle equator {{at the same rate as}} the poles, consistent with MT-MT sliding. Loss of Ncd, a candidate flux motor or brake, did not affect flux in the metaphase/anaphase A isometric state or MT sliding in anaphase B but decreased the duration of the isometric state. Our results suggest that, throughout this isometric state, an outward force exerted on the spindle poles by MT sliding motors is balanced by flux, and that suppression of flux could tip the balance of forces at the onset of anaphase B, allowing MT sliding and polymerization to push the poles apart...|$|R

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{is a result}} of derangement of homeostatic systems of metabolic control and immune defense. Increases in visceral fat and organ adipose, environmental factors and genetic predisposition create imbalances of these homeostatic mechanisms, ultimately leading to a condition in which the oxidative environment cannot be held in check. A significant imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant defenses, a condition called to oxidative stress, ensues, leading to alterations in stress-signalling pathways and potentially end-organ damage. Oxidative stress and metabolic inflammation upregulate the expression pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tissue necrosis factor alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 and interleukin- 6, as well as activating stress-sensitive kinases, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphokinase C isoforms, mitogen-activated protein kinase and inhibitor of kappa B kinase. The JNK pathway (specifically JNK- 1) appears to be a regulator that triggers the oxidative-inflammation cascade that, if left unchecked, can become chronic and cause abnormal glucose metabolism. This can lead to insulin resistance and dysfunction of the vasculature and pancreatic β-cell. The series of events set in motion by the interaction between metabolic inflammation and oxidative stress constitutes an ‘oxidative-inflammatory cascade’, a delicate <b>balance</b> <b>driven</b> by mediators of the immune and metabolic systems, maintained through a positive feedback loop.

40|$|To {{develop a}} {{framework}} for the definition and classification of cancer cachexia {{a panel of experts}} participated in a formal consensus process, including focus groups and two Delphi rounds. Cancer cachexia was defined as a multifactorial syndrome defined by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass (with or without loss of fat mass) that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support and leads to progressive functional impairment. Its pathophysiology is characterised by a negative protein and energy <b>balance</b> <b>driven</b> by a variable combination of reduced food intake and abnormal metabolism. The agreed diagnostic criterion for cachexia was weight loss greater than 5 %, or weight loss greater than 2 % in individuals already showing depletion according to current bodyweight and height (body-mass index (BMI] < 20 kg/m(2)) or skeletal muscle mass (sarcopenia). An agreement was made that the cachexia syndrome can develop progressively through various stages-precachexia to cachexia to refractory cachexia. Severity can be classified according to degree of depletion of energy stores and body protein (BMI) in combination with degree of ongoing weight loss. Assessment for classification and clinical management should include the following domains: anorexia or reduced food intake, catabolic drive, muscle mass and strength, functional and psychosocial impairment. Consensus exists on {{a framework for}} the definition and classification of cancer cachexia.

It automatically seeks stimuli that first satiate the most active internal drives, then the next most active drives, etc. We prove that our algorithm is stable under certain conditions.
