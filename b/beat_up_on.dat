25|$|The Washington Nationals scored {{five runs}} in the sixth inning off Brett Anderson and pulled away for an 8–3 rout of the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium on August 10. Greinke got back on track in his next start with six {{scoreless}} innings while Puig hit a two run home run and a three RBI triple to drive in all the Dodgers runs in a 5–0 win. In the following game, Kershaw allowed just three hits over eight scoreless innings in the Dodgers 3–0 win to take the series. He picked up his 200th strikeout in the game, the sixth straight season he had passed that mark. He became the 10th pitcher in MLB history to accomplish that feat and only the second Dodger (after Sandy Koufax). Billy Hamilton had four hits in four at-bats, including a homerun, and Brandon Phillips and Eugenio Suárez combined for seven RBIs as the Cincinnati Reds <b>beat</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Mat Latos and the Dodgers 10–3 on August 13. The next day, Adrian Gonzalez hit a three-run homer and Alex Wood picked up his first win as a Dodger, 5–3. The Dodgers won 8–3 the following day thanks to four home runs. Puig hit his 10th homer, giving the Dodgers eight players in double digit homers on the season, one shy of the club record. Greinke allowed one run in seven innings and also hit a solo homer in the Dodgers 2–1 win over the Reds on August 16.|$|E

2500|$|Curtis Granderson homered off {{the first}} pitch by Scott Kazmir on May 9, as the New York Mets went on to beat the Dodgers 4–2 at Dodger Stadium.

The Mets took the third game, 4–3, thanks to starting pitcher Noah Syndergaard. He pitched eight strong innings and also hit two home runs, driving in all the teams runs. Dodger starter Kenta Maeda became just the second Dodgers pitcher in history to allow multiple home runs in a game to pitchers, joining Doug McWeeny, who allowed homers to Erv Brame and Fred Fussell of the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 7, 1929 at Ebbets Field. The Dodgers won the next game, 5–0, behind another dominate Clayton Kershaw start. He struck out 13 while pitching a two-hit complete game shutout.

2500|$|The {{success of}} [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] led CBS Records to renew Jones' {{recording}} contract and sparked {{new interest in}} the singer. He {{was the subject of}} an hour-and-a-quarter-long HBO television special entitled George Jones: With a Little Help from His Friends, which saw him performing songs with Waylon Jennings, Elvis Costello, Tanya Tucker, and Tammy Wynette, among others. Jones continued drinking and using cocaine, appearing at various awards shows to accept honors for [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] arguably inebriated, like when he performed [...] "I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool" [...] with Barbara Mandrell at the 1981 Country Music Association Awards. [...] He was involved in several high-speed car chases with police, which were reported on the national news, and one arrest was filmed by a local TV crew; the video, which is widely available online, offers a glimpse into Jones' alter ego when drinking, as he argues with the police officer and lunges at the camera man. Conversely, when sober, Jones was known to be friendly and down to earth, even shy. [...] In a 1994 article on Jones, Nick Tosches remarked that when he first interviewed the singer in April 1976, [...] "One could readily believe the accounts by those who had known him for years: that he had not changed much at all and that he had been impervious to fame and fortune." [...] In an unusually unguarded self-appraisal in 1981, the singer told Mark Rose of The Village Voice, [...] "I don't show a lot of affection. [...] I have probably been a very unliked person among family, like somebody who was heartless. [...] I saved it all for the songs. [...] I didn't know you were supposed to show that love person to person. [...] I guess I always wanted to, but I didn't know how. [...] The only way I could would be {{to do it in a}} song." [...] Years later he commented to The Christian Broadcasting Network's Scott Ross about himself, [...] "I think you're mad at yourself, I think that you're sayin' to yourself 'You don't deserve this. [...] You don't deserve those fans. [...] You don't deserve makin' this money.' [...] And you're mad at yourself. [...] And you <b>beat</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> yourself by drinkin' and losing friends that won't put up with that...It's just one terrible big mess you make out of your life." [...] In 1982, Jones recorded the album A Taste of Yesterday's Wine with Merle Haggard; [...] while Jones, in the wake of his condition, appeared underweight on the album cover, his singing was flawless. [...] His run of hits also continued in the early 1980s, with the singer charting [...] "I'm Not Ready Yet", [...] "Same Ole Me" [...] (backed by the Oak Ridge Boys)", [...] "Still Doin' Time", [...] "Tennessee Whiskey", [...] "We Didn't See a Thing" [...] (a duet with Ray Charles), and [...] "I Always Get Lucky with You", which was Jones' last number one in 1984.|$|E

Unnatural gloom thickened around the lean, straggling troop of Mulgars.

On every peak and crest the lightning played blue and crackling. In its flash the air hung still, bewitched with snow-flakes. Thunder and wind made such a clamour between them that Nod could scarcely hear himself think. But the travellers sat mute and glum, and moved never a finger. Such storms sweep like wild birds through these mountains of Arakkaboa, and, like birds, are as quickly flown away. For {{in a little while}} all was peace again and silence.
