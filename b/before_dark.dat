The parents anticipate night, using a sense of time; in laboratory experiments convict cichlids continued to retrieve young as night approached {{even in the absence of}} any signal, such as dimming light. During the night, the fry bunch up at the bottom of the cave or nest, where the parents fan them.|$|E
5|$|By mid-March, the Prussian {{ships were}} ready for action and the ice had receded far enough that Prince Adalbert ordered Jachmann to conduct a {{reconnaissance}} of the blockading force on 16 March. In the meantime, Dockum's squadron had arrived off Swinemünde two days before. Arcona and Nymphe patrolled off Greifswald, but the weather was very poor, with snow showers hampering visibility. The Prussian gunboats, led by the paddle steamer , remained closer to Swinemünde. Jachmann spotted three vessels at around 15:30, but {{there was not enough}} time <b>before</b> <b>dark</b> to catch them. Instead, Jachmann turned back to Swinemünde, intending to try again the following day.|$|E

5|$|The British 3rd Infantry Division, of I Corps, came ashore on Sword {{beach on}} 6 June 1944, with Caen— inland—as their final objective. The {{vicinity}} of Caen was attractive to Allied planners because it contained airfields and was open, dry and conducive to swift offensive operations, {{for which the}} Allies {{had the advantage of}} numerical superiority in tanks and mobile units. The attempt to capture Caen on D-Day was ambitious and traffic jams on the beaches delayed the 27th Armoured Brigade. The advance of the 3rd Infantry Division diminished as it fought past German fortifications and was stopped short of Caen <b>before</b> <b>dark,</b> by elements of the 21st Panzer Division.|$|E

5|$|Having finally eluded his pursuers, Bompart made {{directly}} for Lough Swilly where the landing {{was scheduled to}} take place. Unaware of the rebellion's defeat, he hoped that Humbert's army would be operating in the Lough Swilly area, as intended in the campaign planned before Humbert left France. Arriving off the coast, Bompart searched for a suitable landing site {{but was unable to}} find one <b>before</b> <b>dark</b> on 10 October. He waited out the night close to Tory Island, but was surprised the next day by sails on the horizon; Warren's squadron had been joined by Countess's ships, and an overwhelming force was bearing down on the French. Abandoning all notions of landing the troops, Bompart hauled his ships close to the wind to give them room to manoeuvre and allow their captains as much opportunity as possible to escape the approaching British.|$|E
5|$|In April1944, {{under the}} command of 1st Airborne Corps, the brigade took part in Exercise Mush, in the {{counties}} of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire. This was an airborne military exercise spread over three days involving the 1st and 6th Airborne Divisions. Unknown to the 6th Airborne, it was a full-scale rehearsal for the division's involvement in the imminent Normandy invasion. In the invasion, the division's two parachute brigades would land just after midnight on 6June, while the 6th Airlanding Brigade arrived later in the day just <b>before</b> <b>dark.</b> The division's objective was to secure the left flank of the invasion area by dominating the high ground in the area between the rivers Orne and Dives. For their part in the operation, the 3rd Parachute Brigade had to destroy the Merville Gun Battery, whose guns were in range of the Sword Beach landings, and to demolish bridges across the River Dives to hamper the arrival of German reinforcements from the east.|$|E

5|$|On 14 June, Littorio {{participated in}} the {{interception}} of the Operation Vigorous convoy to Malta from Alexandria. Littorio, Vittorio Veneto, four cruisers and twelve destroyers were sent to attack the convoy. The British quickly located the approaching Italian fleet and launched several air strikes early on 15 June with Wellington and Bristol Beaufort bombers {{in an attempt to}} prevent them from reaching the convoy. The aircraft scored no hits on the battleships, but they did disable the cruiser , which was later sunk by a British submarine. Later that morning another air attack, this time B-24 Liberators from the USAAF, occurred. The high-level bombers scored one hit on Littorio and several near misses around her and Vittorio Veneto, but neither ship was seriously damaged. Another British strike with Beauforts arrived shortly thereafter, but Italian and German fighters had since arrived and they shot down two Beauforts and damaged five others. By the afternoon, Iachino had concluded that he would not reach the convoy <b>before</b> <b>dark,</b> and so he broke off the operation. On the return voyage, another British air attack succeeded in torpedoing Littoiro.|$|E
5|$|The British convoy {{came under}} air attack on 8 May, {{first by the}} Italian air force, then German Luftwaffe. Over the day, 12 of Ark Royals Fairey Fulmars (the maximum number available) drove off over 50 aircraft, with the {{assistance}} of targeting information from Sheffields radar and anti-aircraft fire from the escorts. During the initial waves, one Fulmar was lost, killing Flight Lieutenant Rupert Tillard and Lieutenant Mark Somerville; another was destroyed with the aircrew recovered, while several others were damaged. Consequently, only seven were able to face the main Luftwaffe force of 34 aircraft, while an attack just <b>before</b> <b>dark</b> was driven off by two aircraft and heavy fire from the ships. The convoy survived without serious damage: the only casualties were to mines, with the Empire Song sunk and New Zealand Star damaged but able to reach port. Ark Royal underwent another aerial attack on 12 May, during her return to Gibraltar. Later that month, she and fellow aircraft carrier Furious delivered Hawker Hurricanes to support Malta.|$|E
5|$|The leading {{infantry}} brigade of 52nd (Lowland) Division, {{which had}} reached Beit Likia on 19 November by moving along a track {{north of the}} main road, was held up towards Kuryet el Enab by a very determined and formidable Ottoman rearguard armed with machine guns at Kustal and Beit Dukka. The Ottoman positions were strongly defended and the 52nd (Lowland) Division could not advance until a mist, rolled down just <b>before</b> <b>dark</b> on 21 November, giving the 75th Division the opportunity to rapidly deploy, climb the ridge, and defeat the Ottoman force with bayonets. That night, the troops ate their iron rations (carried by the men as emergency rations), and some found shelter from the miserable conditions in a large monastery and sanatorium. The night was cold with heavy rain, and those without shelter suffered severely. No supplies arrived till noon the following day owing to congestion on the narrow tracks.|$|E

5|$|After her repairs were completed, Tiger {{served as}} the {{temporary}} flagship of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron while Lion was under repair. In the meantime, {{on the evening of}} 18 August the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by Room 40 which indicated that the High Seas Fleet, less the II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard Sunderland on the 19th, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and six battlecruisers. Throughout the 19th, Jellicoe and Scheer received conflicting intelligence, with the result that having reached its rendezvous in the North Sea, the Grand Fleet steered north in the erroneous belief that it had entered a minefield before turning south again. Scheer steered south-eastward pursuing a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Having realised their mistake the Germans then steered for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position <b>before</b> <b>dark,</b> and broke off contact. Both the British and the German fleets returned home; the British had lost two cruisers to submarine attacks, and a German dreadnought had been damaged by a torpedo.|$|E
5|$|Amid strong resistance, the Australians {{were made}} to fight {{their way through the}} maze of bunkers, punji stakes and booby traps but they were {{eventually}} able to force a Viet Cong regional force company to withdraw as they continued their advance. The area was heavily seeded with trip wires connected to shells and grenades dangling from branches, one of which blew McFarlane and several of his men off their feet. The defenders subsequently withdrew, with 7th Cu Chi Battalion forced north and 3rd Quyet Thang Battalion to the east. Suspecting they were being drawn into a trap—as one of the American battalions of the brigade had been previously during Operation Hump—the Australians moved into a tightly defended perimeter <b>before</b> <b>dark</b> and waited for the communists to counter-attack. As night fell, movement was detected along a trench on the C Company perimeter when a squad of Viet Cong attempted to infiltrate the Australian position. Initially believing the movement to be another Australian patrol that had just departed on a clearing patrol, the machine-gunner on sentry duty finally opened fire at the last safe moment, killing one of the infiltrators at point-blank range and wounding a number of others before they withdrew.|$|E

5|$|Japanese {{indirect}} fire opened the fighting early the following day, falling across the Americal Division's front. In response, US artillery and mortars fired back, targeting the Muda Unit on the South Knob. Such was {{the proximity of}} their position to the US defenders on the North Knob, that the Americans there were forced to take cover from their own artillery. With supplies on the North Knob running low, efforts were made by US troops to bring ammunition, food and water forward; this required soldiers to carry the heavy loads forward under fire; this was an arduous task, {{and in order to}} offer some protection to the carrying parties, they moved forward with protection parties offering covering fire. By midday, a sufficient quantity of supplies had been brought forward for the Americans to launch an attack with one company providing support by fire while another carried out a flanking move to attack the South Knob from the west with flamethrowers and {{indirect fire}} support. After initial gains, this attack was held up and eventually the company had to be withdrawn for the night after reinforcements from the 132nd Infantry Regiment failed to reach them <b>before</b> <b>dark.</b> As local US commanders calculated the cost of continuing to hold Hill 206, the Americal Division sought permission to withdraw, but this was refused by the XIV Corps headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Colin Townsend, the {{commanding}} officer of 6 RAR, was called to the task force command post for a briefing at 10:20. Townsend subsequently issued verbal orders to deploy the battalion at 11:30, and 6 RAR subsequently launched a quick reaction force code named Operation Bribie. The plan envisioned C Company, {{under the command of}} Major Brian McFarlane, being inserted by M113 APCs from A Squadron, 3rd Cavalry Regiment to secure a helicopter landing zone—known as LZ Amber— east of Hoi My, just north of the hamlet of Ap My An. A, B and D Companies would then be flown into LZ Amber by American UH-1 Iroquois helicopters. The battalion would then link up and establish a blocking position to prevent the Viet Cong withdrawing east, before patrolling westward to contact. In direct support were 105mm M2A2 howitzers from the 101st Field Battery at the airstrip at Dat Do, which would subsequently be secured by A Company 5 RAR, while also supporting the operation were Bell H-13 Sioux light observation helicopters from the 161st Reconnaissance Flight and elements of the US 1st Battalion, 83rd Artillery Regiment. A New Zealand forward observation party was attached to the battery and would accompany B Company, 6 RAR. Due to the need to secure the task force base, 6 RAR would be required to return to Nui Dat <b>before</b> <b>dark</b> and this restriction would later impact heavily on the operation.|$|E
