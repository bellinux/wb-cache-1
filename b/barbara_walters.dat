5|$|The {{previous}} year's {{film about}} nude dancers, Showgirls, was generally disliked, so filmmakers feared audiences would pre-judge Striptease on this basis. To avoid any association, advertisements {{were designed to}} make Striptease look more comedic than Showgirls, which was a drama. Besides the subject matter, Striptease and Showgirls did have two notable connections. The choreography in these films was by the same person, Marguerite Derricks. Both also featured performances by Rena Riffel, who plays a dancer in each. To promote the film, Moore appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman and a <b>Barbara</b> <b>Walters</b> special. In both cases, she danced or otherwise exhibited her body.|$|E

40|$|Peace enforcement—the {{threat or}} use of {{military}} force to compel belligerent adherence to a civil war settlement—has become increasingly salient in the past decade. Using a hazards analysis of all civil wars and associated third party interventions between 1945 and 2013 in addition to three structured, focused case studies, I argue that peace enforcement operations that 1) utilize the appropriate typological spoiler management strategy and 2) maintain legitimacy and impartiality through close cooperation with UN peacekeepers, are the most successful at catalyzing civil war termination and securing durable peace. I also provide a theoretical framework through which to study peace enforcement operations that builds upon Stephen Stedman and <b>Barbara</b> <b>Walter’s</b> conceptualization of spoilers, third party security guarantees, and the strategic alteration of belligerent cost-benefit calculus...|$|R
25|$|In June 1978, Arledge {{created the}} newsmagazine 20/20; after its first episode {{received}} harshly negative reviews, the program – which debuted {{as a summer}} series, before becoming a year-round program in 1979 – was immediately revamped to feature a mix of in-depth stories and interviews, with Hugh Downs appointed as its anchor (later paired alongside his former Today colleague <b>Barbara</b> <b>Walters).</b> In February 1979, ABC sold its recording division to MCA Inc. for $20 million; the label was discontinued by March 5 of that year, {{and all of its}} 300 employees were laid off (the rights to the works of ABC Records and all of MCA's other labels have since been acquired by Universal Music Group).|$|E

25|$|Political {{scientist}} <b>Barbara</b> <b>Walter</b> {{suggests that}} most contemporary civil wars are actually repeats of earlier civil wars that often arise when leaders are not {{accountable to the}} public, when there is poor public participation in politics, and {{when there is a}} lack of transparency of information between the executives and the public. Walter argues that when these issues are properly reversed, they act as political and legal restraints on executive power forcing the established government to better serve the people. Additionally, these political and legal restraints create a standardized avenue to influence government as well as increasing the commitment credibility of established peace treaties. According to Walter, it is the strength of a nation’s institutionalization and good governance—not the presence of democracy nor the poverty level—that is the number one indicator of the chance of a repeat civil war according to Walter.|$|R
