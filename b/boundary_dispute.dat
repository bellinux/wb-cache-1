5|$|The Anglo-Venezuelan <b>boundary</b> <b>dispute</b> {{asserted}} for {{the first}} time a more outward-looking American foreign policy, particularly in the Americas, marking the United States as a world power.

The Argentine Navy bought two more armored cruisers from Italy, and the Chilean Navy replied with orders for two Constitución-class pre-dreadnought battleships from British shipyards. The Argentines replied by signing letters of intent with Ansaldo in May 1901 to buy two larger battleships.|$|E
40|$|Modern {{economic}} analysis {{of property rights}} suggests that insecurity of property rights inhibits earnings and investment. By implication, it could be expected that <b>boundary</b> <b>disputes</b> between states, by questioning the property rights regime, would be a key disincentive to investment. From this perspective, the oil industry in Africa presents a puzzle. Oil companies have continued, or even expanded, their investments in areas subject to <b>boundary</b> <b>disputes</b> between states. This paper attempts to explain why <b>boundary</b> <b>disputes</b> may not necessarily present a major obstacle to investment by utilising {{the example of the}} oil industry in Africa. It suggests that the willingness of firms to invest in areas with <b>boundary</b> <b>disputes</b> can partly be explained on the basis of shifting public international law. The paper postulates that developments in international law and legal institutional arrangements have {{played a key role in}} resolving <b>boundary</b> <b>disputes</b> in Africa and elsewhere and have enhanced the confidence of potential investors. We start with a brief examination of <b>boundary</b> <b>disputes</b> in Africa and their relationship with oil company investment. This is followed by an analysis of three aspects o...|$|R

5|$|He left in May {{and arrived}} in November {{of what was}} still the unorganized Oregon Country. At this time the region was under the {{jurisdiction}} of the United States after the settling of the Oregon <b>boundary</b> <b>dispute</b> with Great Britain the previous year. In Oregon, Chapman settled first in what was then Marysville, and is now Corvallis, in the Willamette Valley. In 1848, he relocated to Salem, where he learned of the California Gold Rush while at court at Knox Butte. Chapman went to California for a brief time and had some success in the gold fields before returning in 1849 to Oregon, which had become the Oregon Territory in 1848.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, a later set of {{meetings}} at Champoeg created the Provisional Government of Oregon with a judiciary {{consisting of a}} Supreme Judge and two justices of the peace for trial level courts. Albert E. Wilson was the first judge chosen as the Supreme Judge under this new government, but never served. Other judges were appointed or elected during this pre-territory period {{over the next six}} years. Until 1846 with the settlement of the Oregon <b>boundary</b> <b>dispute,</b> the region was not under the jurisdiction of any foreign power. With the resolution of the boundary issue, Britain retained the territory north of the 49th degree of latitude, with the United States taking the land south to the border of Mexican control California.|$|E
5|$|In January 1896 the British Government {{decided in}} effect to {{recognise}} the US right {{to intervene in}} the <b>boundary</b> <b>dispute,</b> accepting arbitration in principle without insisting on the Schomburgk line as a basis for negotiation. Negotiations between the United States and Britain over the details of the arbitration followed, and Britain was able to persuade the US of much of its views, even as {{it became clear that the}} eventual report of the Boundary Commission would likely be negative towards the British claims. An agreement between the US and UK was signed on 12 November 1896. Cleveland's Boundary Commission's work was suspended in November 1896, though it still went on to produce a large report.|$|E

5|$|Due {{in large}} part to surplus {{revenues}} from the tariffs, federal spending reached one billion dollars for the first time during his term. The spending issue in part led to the defeat of the Republicans in the 1890 mid-term elections. Cleveland defeated Harrison for re-election in 1892, due to the growing unpopularity of the high tariff and high federal spending. Harrison returned to private life and his law practice in Indianapolis. In 1899 Harrison represented the Republic of Venezuela in their British Guiana <b>boundary</b> <b>dispute</b> against the United Kingdom. Harrison traveled to the court of Paris as part of the case and after a brief stay returned to Indianapolis. He died at his home in Indianapolis in 1901 of complications from influenza. Although many have praised Harrison's commitment to African Americans' voting rights, scholars and historians generally regard his administration as below-average, and rank him in the bottom half among U.S. presidents. Historians, however, have not questioned Harrison's commitment to personal and official integrity.|$|E
5|$|In the {{unstable}} period during {{and following the}} 1889 coup in Brazil, which deposed Emperor Dom PedroII, and the 1893–94 navy revolt, the Brazilian Navy found itself unable to care for its own ships, let alone acquire new vessels. Meanwhile, Chile had agreed to a naval-limiting pact in 1902 with Brazil's principal rival, Argentina, as part of solving a larger <b>boundary</b> <b>dispute,</b> but they both retained the vessels built in the interim, {{many of which were}} significantly more modern and powerful than Brazil's ships. The Brazilian Navy was left behind its Argentine and Chilean counterparts in quantity as well—by the turn of the 20th century, Chile's total naval tonnage was , Argentina's , and Brazil's —even though Brazil had nearly three times the population of Argentina and almost five times that of Chile.|$|E
5|$|Mason {{retained}} {{his interest}} in western affairs, hoping in vain to salvage the Ohio Company's land grant. He and Jefferson were among the few delegates to be told of George Rogers Clark's expedition to secure control of the lands north of the Ohio River. Mason and Jefferson secured legislation authorizing Governor Henry to defend against unspecified western enemies. The expedition was generally successful, and Mason received a report directly from Clark. Mason sought to remove differences between Virginia and other states, and although he felt the 1780 settlement of the <b>boundary</b> <b>dispute</b> with Pennsylvania, the Mason-Dixon line (not named for George Mason) was unfavorable to Virginia, he voted for it enthusiastically. Also in 1780, Mason remarried, to Sarah Brent, from a nearby plantation, {{who had never been}} married and was 52 years old. It was a marriage of convenience, with the new bride able {{to take some of the}} burden of parenting Mason's many children off his hands.|$|E

5|$|The {{desire for}} {{responsible}} government {{resulted in the}} abortive Rebellions of 1837. The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture. The Act of Union merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America by 1849. The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon <b>boundary</b> <b>dispute,</b> extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This {{paved the way for}} British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858). In 1867, the same year as Canadian Confederation, Britain declined to purchase for Canada the Alaska territory that was to that point tenuously held by Russia. With the United States purchasing Alaska instead, clearly demarcated borders for Canada, although there would continue to be some disputes about the exact demarkation of the Alaska-Yukon and Alaska-BC border for years to come.|$|E
5|$|US 113 {{continues}} through Showell, where the U.S. Highway crosses Church Branch, Middle Branch, and Birch Branch; these three streams together form Shingle Landing Prong of the St. Martin River, which empties into Isle of Wight Bay, a lagoon {{on the west}} side of Ocean City. Within Showell, the highway parallels Old US 113 (unsigned MD 575B), which is accessed at its south end with a right-in/right-out junction with southbound US 113 and full access via Shingle Landing Road. US113 intersects MD367 (Bishopville Road) at Bishop and has an oblique grade crossing with the rail line, then the route intersects the east end of MD610 (Whaleyville Road). The U.S. Highway crosses Carey Branch, which flows into the Bishopville Prong of the St. Martin River, before it enters Delaware at the Transpeninsular Line, one of the lines surveyed as part of the 18th-century Penn–Calvert <b>boundary</b> <b>dispute.</b>|$|E
5|$|Calhoun had a {{difficult}} relationship with Jackson primarily due to the Nullification Crisis and the Petticoat affair. In contrast with his previous nationalism, Calhoun vigorously supported South Carolina's right to nullify federal tariff legislation he believed unfairly favored the North, putting him into conflict with unionists such as Jackson. In 1832, {{with only a few}} months remaining in his second term, he resigned as vice president and entered the Senate. He sought the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 1844, but lost to surprise nominee James K. Polk, who went on to become president. Calhoun served as Secretary of State under John Tyler from 1844 to 1845. As Secretary of State, he supported the annexation of Texas as a means to extend the slave power, and helped settle the Oregon <b>boundary</b> <b>dispute</b> with Britain. He then returned to the Senate, where he opposed the Mexican–American War, the Wilmot Proviso, and the Compromise of 1850 before his death in 1850. Calhoun often served as a virtual party-independent who variously aligned as needed with Democrats and Whigs.|$|E

5|$|The Russian Emperor AlexanderI {{issued the}} Ukase of 1821 which {{announced}} Russian hegemony over the Northwest Coast from 45°50′ north latitude onwards in a northern direction. The only Russian attempt {{to enforce the}} ukase of 1821 was the seizure of the US brig Pearl by the Russian sloop Apollon, in 1822. The Pearl, a maritime fur trading vessel, was sailing from Boston to Sitka. On a protest from the US government, the vessel was released and compensation paid. Britain and the United States protested and negotiations ultimately resulted in the Russo-American Treaty of 1824 and the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1825. These treaties established 54°40′ as the southern boundary of exclusively Russian territory. The Anglo-Russian treaty delineated the boundary of Russian America fully. The border began on the coast at 54°40′, then ran north along the mountains near the coast until it reached 141° west longitude, after which the boundary ran north along that line of longitude to the Arctic Ocean. Aside from boundary adjustments to the Alaska Panhandle, stemming from the Alaska <b>boundary</b> <b>dispute</b> of the late 19th century, this is the current boundary {{of the state of}} Alaska.
