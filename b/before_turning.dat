It flows {{south-southwest}} {{for a short}} distance <b>before</b> <b>turning</b> south for several tenths of a mile, passing through the border between Dallas Township, Franklin Township, and Kingston Township, and entering Kingston Township. The creek then continues south {{for more than a}} mile <b>before</b> <b>turning</b> southeast and eventually entering Frances Slocum Lake. On the southeastern end of the lake, the creek turns east-northeast for more than a mile, entering a deep valley. It then turns south-southeast for a few miles, entering West Wyoming flowing through a water gap. The creek then turns southeast for some distance <b>before</b> <b>turning</b> southwest and entering Wyoming. It then turns west-southwest for a few miles <b>before</b> <b>turning</b> south and then west. The creek then turns south again, crossing US Route 11. It then turns southwest for more than a mile, entering Forty Fort and reaching its confluence with the Susquehanna River.|$|E
5|$|Roaring Brook then {{enters the}} Elmhurst Reservoir, where it briefly enters Roaring Brook Township before {{entering}} Elmhurst Township and receiving the tributary White Oak Run from the right. The stream continues flowing north-northwest, crossing Pennsylvania Route 435 and reentering Roaring Brook Township several tenths {{of a mile}} further downstream. It then crosses Interstate 84 and receives the tributary Rock Bottom Creek from the right as its valley becomes much deeper and narrower. It continues flowing north-northwest {{for more than a}} mile alongside Pennsylvania Route 435 <b>before</b> <b>turning</b> south-southwest and briefly entering Dunmore before reentering Roaring Brook Township. After several tenths of a mile, the stream turns northwest for a few miles, crossing Interstate 84 and reentering Dunmore. It passes through the Scranton Water Company Reservoir and receives the tributary Little Roaring Brook from the right <b>before</b> <b>turning</b> south and then west. It then turns northwest and crosses Interstate 81 <b>before</b> <b>turning</b> southwest and passing through the Nay Aug Gorge. The stream turns northwest for several tenths of a mile <b>before</b> <b>turning</b> west-southwest and crossing US Route 11. After a few tenths of a mile, it reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between inhalation amplitude and turn management in four approximately 20 minute long spontaneous multiparty conversations in Estonian. The main focus of interest is whether inhalation amplitude is greater <b>before</b> <b>turn</b> onset than in the following inhalations within the same speaking turn. The results show that inhalations directly <b>before</b> <b>turn</b> onset are greater in amplitude than those later in the turn. The difference seems to be realized by ending the inhalation at a greater lung volume value, whereas the initial lung volume before inhalation onset remains roughly the same across a single turn. The {{findings suggest that the}} increased inhalation amplitude could function as a cue for claiming the conversational floor.

5|$|Activity in August {{began when}} a {{tropical}} depression formed on August1 {{to the west}} of Guam. It exhibited a pababolic track, moving west-northwestward <b>before</b> <b>turning</b> to the south, ultimately dissipating on August4; it never intensified beyond tropical depression status. Another short-lived tropical depression formed on August1 near Guam, dissipating on August3 after having moved to the north and west.|$|E
5|$|After forming, the {{depression}} moved slowly southeastward for about 24  hours <b>before</b> <b>turning</b> to the northeast, slowly organizing in the process. On September 10, {{the depression}} turned eastward, and {{later that day}} intensified into Tropical Storm Ginger, the seventh named storm {{of the year in}} the Atlantic, about 325 mi (525 km) south of Bermuda. The storm quickly intensified, and within 24 hours reached winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), making it a hurricane. It turned to the northeast, passing well to the east of Bermuda. Late on September 13, Ginger attained its minimum barometric pressure of 959 mbar (28.32 inHg), and early the next day reached peak maximum sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). After reaching a position about halfway between Bermuda and the Azores, the hurricane's eastward movement halted due to a building ridge to its north and east. It turned sharply southward <b>before</b> <b>turning</b> and beginning a westerly drift, during which Ginger weakened to minimal hurricane status.|$|E
