5|$|In {{identifying}} the remains {{as those of}} Palaeoscincus, Broom initially classified Paranthodon as an ankylosaurian, a statement backed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>of</b> Coombs in the 1970s. However, in 1929, Nopcsa identified the taxon as a stegosaurid, with which most modern studies agree. In 1981, the genus was reviewed with modern taxonomy, and {{found to be a}} valid genus of stegosaurid. However, a more recent 2008 review of Stegosauria could only identify one distinguishing feature, and while that study still referred it to Stegosauridae based on similarity, no diagnostic features of the family could be identified in Paranthodon.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} {{assumption of}} European {{influence in the}} design of Taman Sari has been also challenged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>of</b> Hélène Njoto-Feillard from the University of Pantheon-Sorbonne, presented in a 2003 conference paper. Analysing the historic context and architectural style of the complex, the conclusion is that the creators are most likely local Javanese. The absence of any mention of European involvement in the construction of Taman Sari in Dutch historic descriptions is presented as further evidence in support of this hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, Wieser {{was awarded}} a chair at his alma mater, the University of Vienna, as a full professor, where he taught a new {{generation}} of outstanding economists, including Ludwig von Mises, Joseph Alois Schumpeter, and his most faithful disciple, Friedrich August von Hayek. He developed a monetary theory inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>of</b> Carl Menger, and he applied himself during the following years to the problems of the quantity theory of money. In his last 25 years he dedicated himself to sociology, which he believed must go hand-in-hand with economics for the fullest understanding of human society. By combining these disciplines he was able to forge a new vision of economic policy.|$|E

500|$|The {{influential}} Victorian historian William Stubbs instead {{suggested that}} Edward had actively shaped national history, forming English laws and institutions, and helping England to develop parliamentary and constitutional government. His {{strengths and weaknesses}} as a ruler {{were considered to be}} emblematic of the English people as a whole. Stubbs' student, Thomas Tout, initially adopted the same perspective, but after extensive research into Edward's royal household, and backed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>of</b> his contemporaries into the early parliaments of the period, he changed his mind. Tout came to view Edward as a self-interested, conservative leader, using the parliamentary system as [...] "the shrewd device of an autocrat, anxious to use the mass of the people as a check upon his hereditary foes among the greater baronage." ...|$|E
500|$|Anna's costumes in {{the film}} were {{informed}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>of</b> Norwegian clothing styles. Based on these findings, art director Brittney Lee and her team later found out what materials {{should be used for}} the costumes. Co-director Jennifer Lee created a cheerful wardrobe featuring [...] "playful" [...] floral patterns and saturated colors in order to accurately reflect Anna's personality. The animators also took into account the climate that Anna is living in, costuming her in heavy wools and velvets, reflecting traditional winter clothing of the Scandinavian area. The animators added structures to the costumes in a way, such as pleated dresses, that allows movements, giving the character a free range of [...] "twirl all she wants" [...] throughout the film. In order to deepen the cultural context of the film, rosemaling, a traditional form of Norwegian decorative folk art, was added to almost every character's costumes. Anna and her sister, Elsa, also enjoyed a large number of types of costumes and the layers of costuming that have never been done before. As these characters are running around in the snow, they have to have petticoats, undergarments, capes, [...] "and they have all these layers and layers of things that are all meticulously designed," [...] Brittney explained.|$|E
2500|$|Wieser also {{developed}} a monetary theory. It was inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>of</b> Carl Menger, in particular by his study of currency, which discussed both the historical evolution of money and the theory of its value. Wieser used the theory of marginal utility {{as a basis for}} his monetary theory. It was initially rejected; in fact, some authors tried to prove that marginalism [...] necessarily failed when used as a basis for building such theories. However, his disciple, Ludwig von Mises, studied Wieser's theory and fleshed it out, creating the complex upon which he built the German concept of [...] (money).|$|E

2500|$|In around 1070 {{he founded}} a yeshiva which {{attracted}} many disciples. It is thought by some that Rashi earned his {{living as a}} vintner since Rashi shows an extensive knowledge of its utensils and process, {{but there is no}} evidence for this. Most scholars and a Jewish oral tradition contend that he was a vintner. The only reason given for the centuries-old tradition that he was a vintner being not true is that the soil in all of Troyes is not optimal for wine growing grapes, claimed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>of</b> Rabbi Haym Soloveitchik. Earlier references such as a reference to an actual seal from his vineyard [...] are said not to prove that he sold wine but just that fermented his grapes for his own use.|$|E
2500|$|The {{family was}} {{established}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>of</b> Lucy Briggs (a fluent speaker) and Dr. Martha Hardman de Bautista of the Program in Linguistics at the University of Florida. Jaqaru [...] and Kawki communities {{are in the}} district of Tupe, Yauyos Valley, in the Dept. of Lima, in central Peru. Terminology for this wider language family is not yet well established. Hardman has proposed the name 'Jaqi' ('human') while other widely respected Peruvian linguists have proposed alternative names for the same language family. Alfredo Torero uses the term 'Aru' ('speech'); Rodolfo Cerrón-Palomino, meanwhile, has proposed that the term 'Aymara' should be used for the whole family, distinguished into two branches, Southern (or Altiplano) Aymara and Central Aymara (Jaqaru and Kawki). Each of these three proposals has its followers in Andean linguistics. In English usage, some linguists use the term Aymaran languages for the family and reserve 'Aymara' for the Altiplano branch.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition, {{sponsored}} {{in part by}} the TV show Nova and the BBC, and organised and led by Eric Simonson, {{arrived at}} Everest to search for the lost pair. Guided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>of</b> Jochen Hemmleb, within hours of beginning the search on 1 May, Conrad Anker found a frozen body at [...] on the north face of the mountain. As the body was found at , below where Irvine's axe had been found in 1933 at , the team expected the body to be Irvine's, and were hoping to recover the camera that he had reportedly carried with him. They were surprised to find that name tags on the body's clothing bore the name of [...] "G. Leigh Mallory." [...] The body was well preserved, due to the mountain's climate. A brass altimeter, stag-handled lambsfoot pocket knife with leather slip-case and an unbroken pair of snow-goggles were also recovered from Mallory's corpse. The team could not, however, locate the camera that the two climbers took to document their final summit attempt. Experts from Kodak have said that if a camera is ever found, there is some chance that its film could be developed to produce printable images, if extraordinary measures are taken, and have provided guidance as to handling of such a camera and the film inside, in the event that such were found in the investigation. Before leaving the site of Mallory's death, the expedition conducted an Anglican service for the climber and covered his remains with a cairn on the mountain.|$|E
