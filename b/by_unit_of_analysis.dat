40|$|Background: Some {{health plans}} profile {{physicians}} {{on the basis}} of their relative costs and use these profiles to assign physicians to cost categories. Physician organizations have questioned whether the rules used to attribute costs to a physician affect the cost category to which that physician is assigned. Objective: To evaluate the effect of 12 different attribution rules on physician cost profiles. Design: Under each of the 12 attribution rules, a cost profile was created for the physicians in the aggregated claims database and the physicians were assigned to a cost category (high cost, average cost, low cost, or low sample size). The attribution rules differed <b>by</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis,</b> signal for responsibility, number of physicians who can be assigned responsibility, and threshold value for assigning responsibility.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{synthesise}} current {{evidence for}} the influence on clinical behaviour of patient-specific electronically generated reminders {{available at the time}} of the clinical encounter. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cochrane library of systematic reviews; Science Citation Index Expanded; Social Sciences Citation Index; ASSIA; EMBASE; CINAHL; DARE; HMIC were searched for relevant articles. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: We included controlled trials of reminder interventions if the intervention was: directed at clinician behaviour; available during the clinical encounter; computer generated (including computer generated paper-based reminders); and generated by patient-specific (rather than condition specific or drug specific) data. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials published since 1970. A random effects model was used to derive a pooled odds ratio for adherence to recommended care or achievement of target outcome. Subgroups were examined based on area of care and study design. Odds ratios were derived for each sub-group. We examined the designs, settings and other features of reminders looking for factors associated with a consistent effect. RESULTS: Altogether, 42 papers met the inclusion criteria. The studies were of variable quality and some were affected <b>by</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> errors due to a failure to account for clustering. An overall odds ratio of 1. 79 [95 % confidence interval 1. 56, 2. 05] in favour of reminders was derived. Heterogeneity was high and factors predicting effect size were difficult to identify. LIMITATIONS: Methodological diversity added to statistical heterogeneity as an obstacle to meta-analysis. The quality of included studies was variable and in some reports procedural details were lacking. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: The analysis suggests a moderate effect of electronically generated, individually tailored reminders on clinician behaviour during the clinical encounter. Future research should concentrate on identifying the features of reminder interventions most likely to result in the target behaviour. © Society of General Internal Medicine 2012...|$|E

Methodology: A non-experimental study with a quantitative approach and the document analysis technique. The population universe was formed <b>by</b> 497 <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis.</b> The sample was selected through sampling by logical criteria. The sample consisted <b>of</b> 71 <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis,</b> where 51 corresponded to occupational hazards, 14 to occupational health, and 6 to health education. Data collection was performed by means of a grid composed of two categories, namely: formal aspects and theoretical aspects.

Agreement can be measured using different techniques: kappa statistic, percentage agreement, dice coefficient, sensitivity and specificity. Each of these methods shows specific characteristics and has its own shortcomings. The aim of this contribution is to critically review techniques for the measurement and <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> examiner agreement and to illustrate this using data from a recent survey in young children, the Smile for Life project. The above-mentioned agreement measures are influenced (in differing ways and extents) <b>by</b> the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> (subject, tooth, surface level) and the disease level in the validation sample. These effects are more pronounced for percentage agreement and kappa than for sensitivity and specificity. It is, therefore, important to include information on <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> and disease level (in validation sample) when reporting agreement measures. Also, confidence intervals need to be included since they indicate the reliability of the estimate. When dependency among observations is present [as is the case in caries experience data sets with typical hierarchical structure (surface-tooth-subject) ], this will influence the width of the confidence interval and should therefore not be ignored. In this situation, the use of multilevel modelling is necessary.

It remains to be seen, however, what the best approach is to implementing metadata to manage huge volumes of unstructured information in a large organization. Also, once implemented, how is it possible to track whether it is adding value to the company, and whether the implementation has been successful? Existing literature on metadata seems to either focus too much on technical and quality aspects or describe issues with respect to adoption for general information management initiatives. This research therefore, strives to contribute to these gaps: to give a consolidated framework for striving to understand the value added by implementing metadata. The basic methodology used is that of case study, which incorporates aspects of design science, surveys, and interviews in order to provide a holistic approach to quantitative and qualitative <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the case. The research identifies the various approaches to implementing metadata, particularly studying the one followed <b>by</b> the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> case study, a large company in the Oil and Gas Sector.

The phenomenon of PR activity incorporating [...] all the people, institutions and activities that determine, constitute or result from PR work [...] has exercised a growing influence upon society {{in general and the}} business world in particular (Cutlip, 1994; Ewen, 1996). The thesis seeks to contribute to the examination of a poorly researched phenomenon through a holistic approach by emphasising the importance of the whole and the interdependence of its parts. Given the limited understanding of public relations, it was assumed that a more substantial contribution could be achieved through a general preliminary understanding of the complex phenomenon, rather than by focusing on separate parts without the knowledge of which parts are the most important. Following a review of the relevant literature, a preliminary study was conducted through 15 exploratory interviews, and this led to the identification of core characteristics associated with PR activity.

The Broadband Ecosystem provided a comprehensive framework for examining broadband infrastructure supply and household use and satisfaction with broadband services. Publicly available data was used to map the coverage of broadband access technologies in WDR. A large scale survey assessed household use and satisfaction with broadband services available in WDR. Our findings indicate that rural regions such as WDR are highly reliant on wireless broadband which is more variable in reliability and less affordable comparative to wired broadband. Our findings also indicate that household dissatisfaction with wireless broadband services is particularly evident in remote and outer regional areas. This suggests {{that the lack of}} reliable and affordable wireless broadband services with adequate data quotas are a real barrier to rural communities such as the WDR actively participating in a digital future.

Parking facilities near place of work, use of public transportation in commuting, attitude regarding public transport and ownership and use of Pas 65 (reduction card for the aged). This wave proper consists of seven files, containing family-data(A=SPSS-file, D=raw data), family member-data (B=SPSS-file, E=raw data), transfer-data (C=raw data), week-matrices (F=raw data), and commuting data (G=raw data) respectively. It contains two extra cumulative files. One contains the most relevant variables from all March-waves of all respondents ever participating (P 1015 H). The second (P 1045 J) uses cars owned <b>by</b> panel-members as <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> and contains car-related variables and costs analysis. Moreover this wave contains two general SPSS-setup files, to be used for analyzing the week- matrices and commuting-data files of all waves (P 1045 K and P 1045 L). General hard-copy documentation relevant to all preceding waves is also stored under this number.

There have in vestigated progeny of small-leafed linden and large-leaved linden <b>by</b> means <b>of</b> <b>unit</b> sample <b>analysis</b> in correspondence with existing standards. There has been determined viability, mass of 1, 000 pieces of seeds, laboratory germina tion. It has been deter-mined that viability of small-leafed linden and large-leaved linden seeds being analyzed is quite high comprising 70 – 74 %. The highest viability (74 %) is specific for large-leaved linden earthed during 6 months since spring till autumn. Mass of 1, 000 pieces of seeds comprised from 31. 8 till 142. 5 g. The results of linden seeds by various methods have b een shown. Along with tr aditional ways of preseed treatment (seed-soaking treatment, seed-soaking treatment in potassium permanganate) there have been tested more complex methods of preseed treatment by means of affecting them by positive and negative temperatures as well as by variable temperature modes. Determining laboratory germination, there have been noticed separate seedlings when small-leafed linden seeds being earthed for 2 months at + 18 °C, then for 2 months at 0 °C, then again for 2 months at + 18 °C in tight dishware. There have been investigated the effect of depth of seed placement on their germinability. The highest germinability (23. 0 %) is specific for seeds placed 3. 5 – 4. 0 cm in depth...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1987 In this {{dissertation}} Cambodian refugee use {{of traditional}} and Western healing systems {{to prevent or}} alleviate mental illness are examined. Chrisman's (1977) Health Seeking Process model {{is used as a}} guide for data collection and <b>analysis.</b> The usefulness <b>of</b> the model for <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> a rapidly changing population is then examined. Cambodian refugees in the United States have survived extremely stressful wartime and migration experiences and, as a result, currently exhibit more symptoms of depression and other mental illness than other refugee and migrant groups. Most members of ten Cambodian extended families in Pierce County, Washington were interviewed in depth to determine how they prevent or solve mental health problems. Additionally, healing activities of some families were observed and Buddhist monks, kru khmer, and other traditional healers were interviewed. Descriptions of the families are set within the context of an extensive ethnographic description of the Pierce County Cambodian refugee community. Cambodians in Pierce County attribute current mental illness primarily to weakness of spirit caused by death of or separation from family members. Spirit weakness leaves an individual susceptible to possession by demons or other harmful spirits and also vulnerable to witchcraft. Healing activities include strengthening family relationships, use of Buddhist religion to restore tranquility, exorcism of harmful spirits, and magical protection against demons and witches. Western therapists have been consulted but {{have been found to be}} less effective than traditional healers by the study population. The Health Seeking Process model proved useful for <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the refugee population with a few modifications. <b>By</b> determining the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> to be the family rather than the individual and by adding examination of well behavior and chronic ill health a greater range of health seeking behavior was elicited. A sixth step, Reformulation, was added to the model to analyze change which occurred in health beliefs and practices as a result of health seeking activities. Because refugees are experiencing rapid social and cultural change, specific <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> reformulation has shed light on the changing ethnic identity of the Cambodian community...|$|R

Besides that, contract farming is one program that encourages people {{to get involved in}} farming program. FAMA will provide them with money, training and fertilizer. Sometimes problems will occur when conducting it such as inefficient management, marketing problems and monopoly position. Research objective {{of this study is to}} determine the level of service quality of contract farming and effectiveness towards their users that are the farmers. This research is also beneficial to FAMA itself, farmers and the researcher. For the second chapter, researcher search information on satisfaction, quality, service quality and model for analysis that is suitable to this research. The importance of customer satisfaction for a firm's long-term business survival and growth, monitoring customer satisfaction and diagnosing what factors drive customers' satisfaction should be an essential activity of every firm. While for quality, it is sometimes viewed in relation to some idea of a standard. Excellence-based definitions proposed the idea that products or services may include elements that are perceived as superior or even transcendental. Moreover, Hansen (2001, p. 2005) defines quality as value and then writes that value as the relation between price and quality. One of the most widely used instruments to measure service quality is the SERVQUAL scale developed by Parasuraman in 1985, which then being refined in 1988 and 1991. The model on which SERVQUAL is proposed that customers evaluate the quality of a service on five distinct dimensions are reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy and tangibles. Besides that, for research methodology that is suitable to use. Descriptive research is used in order to determine the farmers satisfaction level of service quality provided <b>by</b> FAMA. While <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> refers to the farmers that are doing vegetable contract, farming and only 60 respondents are selected randomly as a sampling frame. The actual populations of farmers that are doing vegetable contract farming are 76. The researcher collects the data from primary sources through questionnaire that based on the Likert scale method. Furthermore, for data analysis, researcher use the SPSS software to compiled and calculated the data. Researcher calculates the data by using reliability test, Pearson correlation coefficient, t-test, ANOVA and others...|$|R
