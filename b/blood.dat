5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where the <b>blood</b> pressure is decreased {{not due to}} dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump <b>blood</b> through the <b>blood</b> vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and <b>blood</b> pressure.|$|E
5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters <b>blood</b> {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include major surgery and trauma, {{both of which}} may increase the risk because of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering the <b>blood.</b> In orthopedic surgery, venous stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of <b>blood</b> flow {{as part of the}} procedure. Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Pregnancy causes <b>blood</b> to favor clotting, and in the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered <b>blood</b> coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{amphibians}} {{and most}} reptiles {{have a double}} circulatory system, meaning a circulatory system divided into arterial and venous parts. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers – two atria and one ventricle. <b>Blood</b> returning from both the systemic circulation and the lungs is returned, and <b>blood</b> is pumped simultaneously into the systemic circulation and the lungs. The double system allows <b>blood</b> to circulate to and from lungs which deliver oxygenated <b>blood</b> directly to the heart.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bloods</b> {{are often}} {{known as the}} MOBs (“Members of Bloods”). <b>Bloods</b> call {{themselves}} the CKs (“Crip Killers). <b>Bloods</b> greet each other by saying the word “blood”. They try to avoid any word which starts with or even includes the letter ‘C’.|$|R
5|$|An {{examination}} of the <b>blood</b> stains found inside 46Lower Belgrave Street demonstrated that Rivett had been attacked in the basement kitchen, while Lady Lucan had been attacked {{at the top of}} the basement stairs. The <b>blood</b> stains found inside the Ford Corsair were of the AB <b>blood</b> group; the report concluded that this might have been a mixture of <b>blood</b> from both women. Hair similar to Lady Lucan's was also found inside the car.|$|E
5|$|Any <b>blood</b> clot forms {{due to an}} {{imbalance}} between coagulation (the formation of the insoluble <b>blood</b> protein fibrin) and fibrinolysis. The three major mechanisms for such {{an imbalance}} are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations in normal <b>blood</b> flow, injury to the <b>blood</b> vessel wall, and alterations in the constitution of <b>blood</b> (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are due to hypercoagulability.|$|E
5|$|Arterial <b>blood</b> gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a <b>blood</b> sample from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal <b>blood</b> test taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones {{can be measured in}} the urine (acetoacetate) and <b>blood</b> (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary <b>blood</b> β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, capillary <b>blood</b> ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac cycle, in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since <b>blood</b> moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are relaxed, <b>blood</b> will flow into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the <b>blood</b> will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more <b>blood</b> into the ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, <b>blood</b> will be pumped into the pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|E
5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} {{can often}} be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through <b>blood</b> tests. Antibodies directed against red <b>blood</b> cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in <b>blood</b> transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopods {{also have}} colorless <b>blood,</b> {{circulated}} by a muscular heart {{lying in the}} dorsal {{part of the body}} above the stomach. The <b>blood</b> passes through vessels that extend to the front and back of the body, and branch to organs including the lophophore at the front and the gut, muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The <b>blood</b> circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid and <b>blood</b> must mix to a degree. The main function of the <b>blood</b> may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E
5000|$|The National Gang Intelligence Center {{has noted}} {{a high number}} of Juggalo sets with ties to the Los Angeles-based <b>Bloods</b> gang, {{although}} the reason why Juggalos align themselves with <b>Bloods</b> sets remains unclear.

50|$|Increasingly, Britain's {{street gangs}} in certain inner city {{areas such as}} London and Manchester are {{becoming}} more of a cultural transmission of America's Crips and <b>Bloods.</b> This is evidenced by identification with colours, hand signs, graffiti tags {{and in some cases}} gang names, for example Old Trafford Cripz and Moss Side <b>Bloods</b> or 031 (O-Tray-One) <b>Bloods</b> gang and ABM (All Bout Money) Crips.|$|R
5000|$|Solo is {{released}} from Youth Authority on a 12-hour furlough to attend his brother's funeral with instructions {{to be returned}} to the facility by 8:00 PM. At the funeral a guest pastor speaks to the mourners. He addresses his message specifically to the <b>Bloods</b> in attendance. The guest pastor informs the <b>Bloods</b> that he's an ex-convict and talks about what his self-destructive lifestyle has cost him: his ten-year-old son. He invites the <b>Bloods</b> to give their lives to God and renounce gang banging. After some initial hesitation several <b>Bloods</b> walk up to the altar. After burying Poo Bear the <b>Bloods</b> and Poo Bear's family return to his mother's house for a cookout. At the cookout B-Fool instigates a retaliation against the Crips, specifically goading Solo to seek revenge for his brother's murder. B-Fool and the <b>Bloods</b> peer-pressure Solo, threatening to [...] "fuck him up" [...] every time they see him if he doesn't retaliate. As the <b>Bloods</b> plan their retaliation Tuffie attacks another young woman at the cookout who she suspects was fooling around with Poo Bear and was the woman who paged him on the day he was murdered.|$|R
5|$|Capillaries are {{organized}} into capillary beds in tissues; {{it is here}} that <b>blood</b> exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds <b>blood</b> flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the <b>blood</b> has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As <b>blood</b> travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing <b>blood</b> back to the heart. Once the <b>blood</b> reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated <b>blood</b> then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.|$|E
5|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} for people with <b>blood</b> lead levels above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation for people with symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high <b>blood</b> lead levels is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead. Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when <b>blood</b> lead levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, <b>blood</b> lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into <b>blood</b> from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E
5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} may {{be diagnosed}} when {{the combination of}} hyperglycemia (high <b>blood</b> sugars), ketones in the <b>blood</b> or on urinalysis and acidosis are demonstrated.

5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} <b>blood</b> accumulates {{in the wall}} of the <b>blood</b> vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} <b>blood</b> to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the <b>blood</b> may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small <b>blood</b> vessels that supply the outer layer of larger <b>blood</b> vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the <b>blood</b> vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the <b>blood.</b>|$|E
5|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} {{and mechanical}} ventilation {{may be used}} to ensure proper oxygen supply and provide a secure airway. Hypotension (low <b>blood</b> pressure), which has a devastating outcome in TBI, can be prevented by giving intravenous fluids to maintain a normal <b>blood</b> pressure. Failing to maintain <b>blood</b> pressure can result in inadequate <b>blood</b> flow to the brain. <b>Blood</b> pressure may be kept at an artificially high level under controlled conditions by infusion of norepinephrine or similar drugs; this helps maintain cerebral perfusion. Body temperature is carefully regulated because increased temperature raises the brain's metabolic needs, potentially depriving it of nutrients. Seizures are common. While they can be treated with benzodiazepines, these drugs are used carefully because they can depress breathing and lower <b>blood</b> pressure. TBI patients are more susceptible to side effects and may react adversely or be inordinately sensitive to some pharmacological agents. During treatment monitoring continues for signs of deterioration such as a decreasing level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{also can}} be {{evaluated}} by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in <b>blood</b> samples. EP {{is a part of}} red <b>blood</b> cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the <b>blood</b> is high, with a delay of a few weeks. Thus EP levels in conjunction with <b>blood</b> lead levels can suggest the time period of exposure; if <b>blood</b> lead levels are high but EP is still normal, this finding suggests exposure was recent. However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated <b>blood</b> lead levels below about 35μg/dL. Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in iron deficiency, use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.|$|E
5000|$|The {{success of}} N.W.A. had {{frustrated}} {{many in the}} gang community, who saw the group capitalizing on the gang lifestyle. The <b>Bloods</b> & Crips project was originally organized by rappers O.Y.G redruM781 and Tweedy Bird Loc. Actual gang members, Crips from Compton, Watts and Long Beach, <b>Bloods</b> from Inglewood and Los Angeles auditioned for the group and the best ones were chosen for the album.
