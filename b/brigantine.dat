5|$|In 1927, a spur of Route 4, Route S4A, was {{proposed}} as a route running from Route 4 (now U.S. Route 9) in Tuckerton in Ocean County south to Little Beach. In 1929, this route was to continue south through <b>Brigantine</b> to Atlantic City, with the portion south of Little Beach {{to be built}} by Atlantic County. The state of New Jersey took over the proposed extension of Route S4A from Little Beach to Atlantic City in 1938. However, the portion of this route between <b>Brigantine</b> and the Atlantic/Ocean County line was never built, and the portion of road that existed in Ocean County {{was removed from the}} state highway system by 1941. In 1945, another route called Route S56, a spur of Route 56 (now U.S. Route 30), {{was proposed}} to run north along <b>Brigantine</b> Boulevard (present-day Route 187 and Route 87) from Atlantic City to <b>Brigantine.</b> In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 87 was designated as an unsigned route along the former alignment of Route S4A and the proposed Route S56 between U.S. Route 30 in Atlantic City and <b>Brigantine.</b> Following the 1953 renumbering, the southern portion of Route 87 in Atlantic City split into two alignments, with one following Huron Avenue and the other following <b>Brigantine</b> Boulevard. Eventually, the alignment of Route 87 along <b>Brigantine</b> Boulevard between U.S. Route 30 and Huron Avenue became Route 187. In 2001, the Atlantic City – <b>Brigantine</b> Connector was completed, linking Route 87, the casinos in the Marina District, and <b>Brigantine</b> with the Atlantic City Expressway.|$|E
5|$|Route 87 is a {{state highway}} located in Atlantic County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs , heading north from Atlantic City at an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 30 (Absecon Boulevard) to <b>Brigantine,</b> where it terminates {{at the end of}} the Justice Vincent S. Haneman Memorial Bridge over the Absecon Channel, continuing as County Route 638 (<b>Brigantine</b> Boulevard). In Atlantic City, the route runs through the Marina District, which contains a few casinos, along Huron Avenue and <b>Brigantine</b> Boulevard. Here, Route 87 intersects with Route 187 (<b>Brigantine</b> Boulevard) and the Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector, the latter providing a limited-access route between Route 87 and the Atlantic City Expressway. Route 87 is the only road to and from <b>Brigantine.</b>|$|E
5|$|What is now Route 87 was {{initially}} proposed as Route S4A in 1927, a spur from Route 4 (now U.S. Route 9) in Tuckerton, Ocean County, south through <b>Brigantine</b> to Atlantic City. The {{portion of this}} route south of Little Beach was to be built by Atlantic County; however, the state took over plans of building the road in 1938. Despite this, Route S4A was never completed between <b>Brigantine</b> and Little Beach, and {{the portion of the}} road that existed in Ocean County was removed from the state highway system by 1941. In 1945, Route S56, a spur of Route 56 (now U.S. Route 30), was proposed to run from Atlantic City to <b>Brigantine</b> along <b>Brigantine</b> Boulevard. Route 87 was created on its current alignment in 1953 as an unsigned route, replacing Route S4A and the proposed Route S56. Previously, Route 87 split into two alignments in Atlantic City along Huron Avenue and <b>Brigantine</b> Boulevard; the <b>Brigantine</b> Boulevard alignment eventually became Route 187.|$|E

5|$|The route {{passes to}} the west of the Golden Nugget casino and comes to a ramp that {{provides}} access from northbound Route 87 to both the Trump Marina and Harrah's Atlantic City casinos before passing under the northbound Atlantic City – <b>Brigantine</b> Connector again. Immediately after, the route has a ramp from the southbound direction that provides access to the connector and westbound U.S. Route 30. The northbound Atlantic City – <b>Brigantine</b> Connector parallels Route 87 to the east as it turns northeast and comes to a right-in/right-out in the southbound direction that serves both Harrah's and Borgata. From here, the route passes to the southeast of Harrah's. The northbound Atlantic City – <b>Brigantine</b> Connector merges onto northbound Route 87 before the route comes to a ramp that provides access to the northbound direction of the route from Harrah's. Past here, the route crosses over the Absecon Channel on the Justice Vincent S. Haneman Memorial Bridge and runs along the border of Atlantic City to the northwest and <b>Brigantine</b> to the southeast. After crossing the Absecon Channel, the route arrives on <b>Brigantine</b> Island and passes through wetlands, with U-turn ramps in both directions. A short distance later, Route 87 ends and County Route 638 continues along <b>Brigantine</b> Boulevard through <b>Brigantine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following {{a number}} of {{successful}} raids, Lowther eventually captured a large 6-gun <b>brigantine</b> (named Rebecca) on 28 May 1722. He gave it to Low to captain. With a crew of 44, Low amicably dissolved his partnership with Lowther.|$|E
50|$|Cortés {{goes on to}} {{describe}} {{the construction of the}} <b>brigantines</b> used to enter Tenochtitlán by the canals. These vessels were manufactured in Tlaxcala, as this region was the main source of support for the Spaniards within the territory. The thirteen ships were transported in parts to the lake of Texcoco {{with the help of the}} Tlaxcaltecs, building docks to assemble the <b>brigantines,</b> and channels to connect the docks with the lake. It was also from there that the military campaign was launched.|$|R

5|$|Route 87 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 30 in Atlantic City, {{heading to the}} northeast on Huron Avenue, an undivided road with two northbound lanes and three southbound lanes. Immediately after beginning, it passes under the Atlantic City – <b>Brigantine</b> Connector and comes to a ramp that provides access from southbound Route 87 to the southbound connector. From here, the route widens to seven lanes, with two northbound lanes and five southbound lanes. It passes by the Borgata casino, with a ramp from the casino to the northbound direction. The road becomes a four-lane divided highway and passes under a ramp from the Atlantic City – <b>Brigantine</b> Connector to the Borgata before heading under northbound direction of the connector. Here, a ramp from the connector provides access to Route 87. A short distance later, the route comes to the northern terminus of Route 187 and turns north to follow <b>Brigantine</b> Boulevard, which is a four-lane divided highway.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} built at Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth & Co., Ltd on Tyneside. She was laid down on 2 April 1906, and {{launched}} at 3 p.m. on 13 April 1907 by Lady Allendale. On 28 December 1907, while still fitting out, she {{was hit by}} the collier Oden, {{which resulted in the}} buckling of beams and frames in the hull and five bottom plates being stove in. She was officially completed on 16 March 1909. On 18 March, she sailed from the Tyne to Portsmouth, where she would be commissioned. On the way, she collided with the <b>brigantine</b> Mary Ann, and stood by until the lifeboat John Birch arrived from Yarmouth to take the <b>brigantine</b> in tow.|$|E

5000|$|The Aztec canoe fleets {{worked well}} for attacking the Spanish because they allowed the Aztecs to {{surround}} the Spanish {{on both sides of}} the causeway. Cortés decided to make an opening in the causeway so that his <b>brigantines</b> could help defend his forces from both sides. He then distributed the launches amongst his attacking forces, four to Alvarado, six for Olid, and two to Sandoval on the Tepeaquilla causeway. After this move, the Aztecs could no longer attack from their canoes on the opposite side of the Spanish <b>brigantines,</b> and [...] "the fighting went very much in our favour", according to Díaz.|$|R
5|$|September 21, 1938– The New England Hurricane of 1938 {{passes to}} the east of the state, causing strong winds of up to 100mph (160km) and {{powerful}} waves along the coastline.

5|$|Bonnet's initial cruise {{took him}} to the coast of the Colony of Virginia, near the {{entrance}} of the Chesapeake Bay, where he captured and plundered four vessels, and burned the Barbadian ship Turbet to keep news of his crimes from his home island. He then sailed north to New York City, taking two more ships, and picking up naval supplies and releasing captives at Gardiners Island. By August 1717, Bonnet had returned to the Carolinas, where he attacked two more ships, a <b>brigantine</b> from Boston and a Barbadian sloop. He stripped the <b>brigantine,</b> but brought the cargo-filled Barbadian sloop to an inlet off North Carolina to use for careening and repairing the Revenge. After the Barbadian sloop's tackle was used to careen the Revenge, the ship was dismantled for timber, and the remains were then burned. In September 1717, Bonnet set course for Nassau, which was then an infamous pirate den on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas. En route, he encountered, fought, and escaped from a Spanish man of war. The Revenge was badly damaged, Bonnet was seriously wounded, and half the crew of the sloop was killed or wounded in the encounter. Putting in at Nassau, Bonnet replaced his casualties and refitted the Revenge, increasing the sloop's armament to twelve guns.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1777, the {{regiment}} and a detachment of the Maryland Line {{under the command}} of General William Smallwood (the 2nd Maryland Brigade) arrived at Wilmington, Delaware, to protect the city from the British. They encamped at the present-day Brandywine Park in Wilmington. The highlight of this time included Smallwood's capture of the British armed <b>brigantine</b> Symmetry on December 30. This ship was laden with supplies, including winter clothing, en route to the British in Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, many {{improvements}} {{have been}} made to the Atlantic City Expressway. A new interchange with County Route 689 on the Gloucester Township/Winslow Township border was completed in 2000 at a cost of $5 million. The Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector was completed on July 31, 2001 to connect the Atlantic City Expressway to the Marina district and <b>Brigantine.</b> In 2005, the Atlantic City Expressway added a third lane in both directions between the Garden State Parkway and Atlantic City and in the eastbound direction between Route 73 and the Garden State Parkway. In addition, the Pleasantville Toll Plaza was reconstructed, replacing the older cash booths with newer technology.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 1525 the {{expedition}} {{arrived at the}} Maya village of Tenciz. With local guides they headed into the hills north of Lake Izabal, where their guides abandoned them to their fate. The expedition became lost in the hills and came close to starvation before they captured a Maya boy who led them out to safety. Cortés found a village {{on the shore of}} Lake Izabal, perhaps Xocolo. He crossed the Dulce River to the settlement of Nito, somewhere on the Amatique Bay, with about a dozen companions, and waited there {{for the rest of his}} army to regroup over the course of the next week. By this time the remnants of {{the expedition}} had been reduced to a few hundred; Cortés succeeded in contacting the Spaniards he was searching for, only to find that Cristóbal de Olid's own officers had already put down his rebellion. Cortés constructed an improvised <b>brigantine</b> and, accompanied by canoes, he ascended the Dulce River to Lake Izabal, with about 40 Spaniards, and a number of Indians. He at first believed he had reached the Pacific, but soon realised his error. At the western end of the lake, he marched inland and engaged in battle with the Maya natives at the city of Chacujal, on the Polochic River. He seized plentiful supplies of food from the city and sent supplies back to Nito in the <b>brigantine.</b> He had rafts built to ferry supplies back downriver, and returned to Nito with them, while most of his men marched back overland. Cortés then returned to Mexico by sea.|$|E
5|$|St. Charles Bay was {{the domain}} of the Karankawa Indians before the arrival of European settlers. The Spanish {{referred}} to the bay as Laguna del Bergantine, which translated to the Lagoon of the <b>Brigantine.</b> The name is the likely the source of Burgantine Lake, found at the bay's head. The name derived from a Spanish vessel that was being used to transfer money to Texas to bribe Mexican soldiers at Goliad and San Antonio in 1818. It was caught in an Aransas Bay storm that swept the ship into the waters of St. Charles Bay, landing in a creek at its base. Supposedly, the ship was abandoned in the surrounding prairie (Fagan ranch near Tivoli, Texas), and its parts used by area settlers (later determined to be the Fagan family) to build homes.|$|E
60|$|At the Skyeman's suggestion, we now {{proceeded}} to throw round the <b>brigantine's</b> {{head on the}} other tack. For until daylight we desired to alter the vessel's position as little as possible, fearful of coming unawares upon reefs.|$|R

5000|$|A tall ship is a large, traditionally-rigged sailing vessel. Popular modern tall ship rigs include topsail schooners, <b>brigantines,</b> brigs and barques. [...] "Tall ship" [...] {{can also}} be defined more {{specifically}} by an organization, such as for a race or festival.|$|R
5|$|Tudor's {{plan was}} to export ice as a luxury good to wealthy members of West Indies and the {{southern}} US states, where he hoped they would relish the product during their sweltering summers; conscious of the risk that others might follow suit, Tudor hoped to acquire local monopoly rights in his new markets {{in order to maintain}} high prices and profits. He started by attempting to establish a monopoly on the potential ice trade in the Caribbean and invested in a <b>brigantine</b> ship to transport ice bought from farmers around Boston. At the time, Tudor was regarded by the business community at best as something of an eccentric, and at worst a fool.|$|E
5|$|While Mary Celeste {{prepared}} to sail, another <b>brigantine,</b> the Canadian , lay in nearby Hoboken, New Jersey, awaiting a cargo of petroleum destined for Genoa via Gibraltar. Her captain, David Morehouse, {{and his first}} mate Oliver Deveau, were Nova Scotians, both highly experienced and respected seamen. As captains with common interests, {{it is likely that}} Morehouse and Briggs knew each other, if only casually. Some accounts assert that they were close friends who, on the evening before Mary Celestes departure, dined together, but the evidence for this is limited to a recollection by Morehouse's widow, 50 years after the event. Dei Gratia departed for Gibraltar on November 15, eight days after Mary Celeste, following the same general route.|$|E
5|$|An {{approaching}} trough {{over the}} central United States induced high wind shear over Sandy as it traversed the Bahamas, causing the hurricane to weaken to {{a tropical storm}} while turning more northeastward. The {{southern part of the}} trough detached, causing the shear to decrease late on October28 and allowing Sandy to regain strength. It attained a secondary peak of Category2 strength the following day, and later turned toward the west. During this change in direction, Sandy began to transition into an extratropical cyclone, a process it completed before making landfall near <b>Brigantine,</b> New Jersey, late on October29. The extratropical remnants weakened gradually overland, and the center of circulation was declared indistinguishable over western Pennsylvania two days later. In addition to becoming the largest Atlantic hurricane, Sandy broke records for the lowest pressures ever observed in many cities across the Northeastern United States.|$|E
5000|$|Dingjia <b>brigantines</b> {{were still}} used in China {{as late as}} the Ming and Qing periods. It was favoured by {{officers}} for its rich, expensive look and protection. Later examples, however, often lacked iron plates and were merely a military uniform.|$|R
