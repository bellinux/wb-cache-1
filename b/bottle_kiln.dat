25|$|Most of {{the major}} pottery {{companies}} based in Stoke-on-Trent have factory shops and visitor centres. The £10million Wedgwood Museum visitor centre opened in the firm's factory in Barlaston in October 2008. The Dudson Centre in Hanley is a museum of the family ceramics business, which is partly housed in a Grade II listed <b>bottle</b> <b>kiln.</b> It is also a volunteer centre. Burleigh in Middleport is the world's oldest working Victorian pottery. There are also smaller factory shops, such as Royal Stafford in Burslem, Moorcroft in Cobridge and Emma Bridgewater in Hanley. In addition, there are ambitious plans to open the huge Chatterley Whitfield Colliery as a mining museum, since it has been given scheduled monument status.|$|E
2500|$|Another heritage-listed church {{from this}} period is Our Lady Star of the Sea, Greenwich, a Gothic Revival church begun in 1846 and {{completed}} [...] It is surmounted by a tower completed by an ornate spire {{which in turn is}} complemented by the smaller spire of the adjacent stair turret. The church has remarkable architectural similarities to Wardell's later and largest work, St. Patrick's Cathedral in Melbourne. Also heritage-listed is Our Immaculate Lady of Victories (also known as St. Mary's Church), situated in Clapham Park Road, Clapham, South London, constructed between 1848 and 1851, the same year that Wardell completed Holy Trinity, Hammersmith. Other Grade II* listed heritage buildings designed in part or full by Wardell include the Church of St Mary and St Michael in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets; the Roman Catholic Church of St Peter and St Edward in Palace Street, Westminster; the Gate Lodge and Gateway, the Training College, the Priory, the former convent building, and the chapel at the former convent of the Holy Child Jesus on Magdalen Road in Hastings; Ellingham, a house in Thanet, Kent; the Old Lodge and Chapel of the Sacred Heart of Digby Stuart College; a lodge at Grove House in the London Borough of Wandsworth; and the Spode Pottery including buildings around the north west courtyard, including the entrance gate, gate piers and remains of the <b>bottle</b> <b>kiln</b> at Stoke-on-Trent.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bottle</b> <b>kilns</b> were {{typical of}} the {{industrial}} landscape of Stoke-on-Trent, where nearly 50 are preserved as listed buildings. Their association with Stoke-on-Trent {{reflects the fact that}} the British ceramic industry was mainly based in that city. <b>Bottle</b> <b>kilns</b> are found in other locations; for example Coalport, which had a pottery industry.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bottle</b> <b>kilns</b> were {{constructed}} until the mid-twentieth century, {{after which they}} were replaced by other types of kiln, as the industry ceased to be coal-fired.|$|R

50|$|In 1946 Finch {{bought the}} {{business}} from Cardew and restarted the pottery {{with the help}} of Sidney Tustin. The staff expanded and at last the <b>bottle</b> <b>kiln</b> saw proper usage. Students joined the pottery staff to learn the craft as they worked and many of them subsequently went on to be established potters in their own right. But the business was not as successful as hoped and in the early 1950s, the pottery was downsized. The last <b>bottle</b> <b>kiln</b> firing took place in 1954.|$|E
50|$|East Liverpool Pottery {{operated}} in East Liverpool, Ohio from its construction in 1844 until it ceased production in 1939. The site {{was made up}} of five buildings and 2 <b>kilns.</b> The company's <b>bottle</b> <b>kilns,</b> their shape resembling a bottle, were used for the production of pottery ware.|$|R
50|$|The museum {{allows the}} visitor {{to explore the}} <b>bottle</b> <b>kilns</b> and {{exhibits}} the principal ancillary rooms: the engine house, the slip room, saggar making workshop. It shows aspects of working with clay- including hands on displays of throwing, moulding and decorating. Colour and gilding is presented as interpretive panels.|$|R
50|$|There is a Blue Circle {{cement works}} based in Barnstone. The first lime kiln was erected in 1864. Cement {{manufacture}} {{began on the}} site in 1885, when the first rotary kiln was installed. Sixteen <b>bottle</b> <b>kilns</b> followed in 1886. Barnstone later specialised in manufacturing cements for the mining industry.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bottle</b> <b>kiln,</b> or bottle oven, {{is a type}} of kiln. The word 'bottle' {{refers to}} the shape of the {{structure}} and not to the kiln's products, which are pottery, not glass.|$|E
5000|$|Bottle Kiln: [...] This <b>Bottle</b> <b>Kiln</b> {{is located}} at the corner of 3rd Street and Lisbon Street in Wellsville, Ohio. The kiln is 41.5 feet high. The Kiln is {{maintained}} by the Wellsville Historical Society, P.O. Box 13, Wellsville, OH 43968.|$|E
50|$|Cardew was {{a restless}} spirit {{and left to}} set up Wenford Bridge in Bodmin as his new pottery, leaving Finch to run Winchcombe Pottery. The 2nd World War caused the Tustin {{brothers}} to be called up and the <b>bottle</b> <b>kiln</b> was now too large. A small kiln was constructed in 1940. In 1943, Finch was called up and the pottery closed.|$|E
50|$|Production {{continued}} until 1984. The <b>bottle</b> shaped <b>kilns</b> and tall chimney are {{the legacy of}} the ceramics factory.|$|R
5000|$|In the 19th century, Stoke had a {{thriving}} pottery industry, hence its nickname, [...] "The Potteries". Since {{the last half}} of the 20th century, however, almost all of the bottle-shaped kilns have been taken down, due to regulations from the Clean Air Act - an estimated 4,000 <b>bottle</b> <b>kilns</b> in the heyday of the pottery industry, today reduced to a mere 46. Successful Stoke-upon-Trent potters include Spode, Copeland, Minton and Biltons.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the largest}} {{sections}} of the diorama is the 350 yd long Hay Inclined Plane of the Shropshire Canal, opened in 1792. Although mostly gravity worked, this also used an early Heslop patent rotative beam engine to winch canal tubs from the canal basin at the top. At {{the foot of the}} inclined plane is the short Coalport Canal and the newly opened Coalport China manufactory (1795) with its four <b>bottle</b> <b>kilns.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cardew {{wanted people}} to use his pottery in regular daily use, {{as has been the}} {{tradition}} in early centuries. He followed the classic English slipware style using the red earthenware Winchcombe clay. After a difficult star and many trials, he managed to start slipware production. Experiments with firing the pots in the <b>bottle</b> <b>kiln</b> were eventually successful. For the produce of three men, the <b>bottle</b> <b>kiln</b> was really too large but it was what they had. A firing went on for three days. Gradually Cardew's skills and hard work were recognised. In 1935 he had one of his pots exhibited in the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 1935 the team was expanded to include Charlie, Sid's younger brother. A young chemist called Ray Finch tried to join the pottery staff in 1935 but was sent away by Cardew to gain some pottery experience. Finch returned in 1936, aged 22, and was able to convince Cardew that he now knew enough and he joined the team.|$|E
50|$|Each firing {{would use}} 14 tons (13 tonnes) of coal. It was very energy inefficient and popular {{sources say that}} between 50% and 95% of the heat was lost up the chimney. Coal burning is a very dirty process; the smoke from a <b>bottle</b> <b>kiln</b> would eddy around the kiln top, and curl down to ground level either into the yard of the pot bank or into the streets and houses around.|$|E
50|$|Finch was {{interested}} in stoneware, and in 1952 he started experimenting with the more difficult clay. The experiments were eventually successful and in 1954 the <b>bottle</b> <b>kiln</b> was fired for the last time, since it was too large and unsuitable for stoneware. Slipware production continued by using electric kilns, but was phased out in 1964. In 1974 the wood fired kiln was built to replace the oil fired kiln for stoneware production and has been used ever since.|$|E

50|$|Gladstone {{has seen}} its share of celebrity interest, from Tony Robinson filming for a BBC {{documentary}} 'The Worst Jobs in Britain' and from Alan Titchmarsh. It also has regular visits from the Blue Peter crew, and numerous children's TV programmes. In 1986, parts 13 and 14 of the Doctor Who serial The Trial of a Time Lord were shot at the museum. In the early 1990s it was featured on Noel's House Party with a live 'gunging' outside of the <b>bottle</b> <b>kilns.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Grand Junction Canal {{came through}} the area between 1793 and 1800, with canal-side wharfs in Fenny Stratford, Great Linford, Bradwell and Wolverton. The route {{bypassed}} Newport Pagnell but, in 1817, an arm was dug to it from Great Linford. Trade along the canal stimulated the local economy. A large brickworks was established near the canal in Great Linford: two <b>bottle</b> <b>kilns</b> and the clay pits can still {{be seen on the}} site. Pottery from the Midlands begins to appear in excavations of dwellings from that period.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s local {{children}} {{attended school}} at Cliffe or walked to Cooling Street where {{the school was}} an in old Methodist Chapel built in 1899. It {{was known as the}} chapel in the orchard. The Alpha cement factory owned by APCM provided local employment until it closed in 1970. Cement making had begun at Cliffe in 1854 in a <b>bottle</b> <b>kiln.</b> Women worked seasonally picking fruit, local growers used the railway to transport their goods to market.|$|E
50|$|Bernard Leach is {{credited}} with restarting craftsman pottery in Britain in 1920. One of his early students was Michael Cardew who, at 25, {{was looking for a}} suitable site for his own pottery and in 1926 rented the old pottery buildings. Influencing his choice were the availability of local clay and the original <b>bottle</b> <b>kiln.</b> Cardew recruited two locals, critically Elijah Comfort, aged 63 and who had worked before in the pottery, and inspirationally, in 1927, Sidney Tustin (aged 13).|$|E
50|$|This {{site has}} a record of pollen {{throughout}} the Hoxnian interglacial around 400,000 years ago, and this is the best vegetational record for any British interglacial site. Seasonal layers in lake sediments have made it possible to estimate the duration of the Hoxnian. Clay deposited in the lake is quarried at a brickworks on the site, and this exposes layers above the Hoxnian ones of a later colder period. There is also a Grade II listed early nineteenth-century <b>bottle</b> <b>kiln</b> and brick tile works on the site.|$|E
50|$|In 1820 Richard Greaves {{started a}} lime kiln using Blue Lias from a quarry {{just north of}} the village. Completion of the railway in 1852 made it easier for the works to obtain coal and {{distribute}} its lime and cement. The business became Greaves, Bull and Lakin and in 1855 opened a new cement works. By 1882 it had four <b>bottle</b> <b>kilns</b> and was making 120 tons of Portland cement a week. The Great Western revised the railway junction to the works in 1883 and had a signal box built for it in 1899. By 1907 there were 18 chamber kilns making 600 tons a week, and more railway track was laid including a second connection to the works. Quarrying extended across the parish boundary into Harbury.|$|R
50|$|Donald was {{encouraged}} by Percy Norman Shelley to follow his technical and scientific ideas. By 1956 he had been successful in developing and manufacturing the Top Hat Kiln. In May that year Shelley Potteries formed a subsidiary company, Shelley Electric Furnaces Ltd. This company began constructing kilns for other companies. To cope with this work, new premises were built on the site in 1960 and an extension was built in 1964.Since {{the end of the}} war, Shelley continued to hold its own on the pottery manufacturing side of the business on both the home and overseas market. New technology was starting to change the face of the pottery industry and the old <b>bottle</b> <b>kilns</b> were becoming redundant. This meant that some smaller family-run firms were finding the costs of these changes beyond their means.|$|R
50|$|In 1866 Earle's Cement {{acquired}} the cement {{works on the}} near the river bank and land south of the Victoria Dock Branch Line; the works was connected by rail sidings to the dock branch. Production was around 3000t pa of Roman cement in 1870. From 1875 <b>bottle</b> <b>kilns</b> were constructed {{for the production of}} Portland cement, with a capacity of 38t per week by around 1882. From 1888 chamber kilns were installed, with 28 in total by 1898 with a total capacity of 980t per week. The first two Rotary kilns were installed in 1906, adding a capacity of 860t per week. Further rotary kilns were added in 1912 and 1920, by which time the location of the plant was seen a non-optimal, Earle's large plant in Hope, Derbyshire being preferred.|$|R
50|$|In 1926 Michael Cardew {{had founded}} Greet Potteries at Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, {{where he made}} pottery in the English slipware tradition, {{functional}} and affordable, and fired in a traditional <b>bottle</b> <b>kiln.</b> In 1935 Finch came to Gloucestershire and asked Cardew whether he could join the pottery. Cardew advised him to get basic skills first, and Finch went to the Central School of Art and Design, where he studied under Dora Billington and was recruited by Cardew in 1936. Finch took over the pottery, now known as Winchcombe Pottery, in 1939.|$|E

50|$|Cardew was {{the first}} {{apprentice}} at the Leach Pottery, St Ives, Cornwall, in 1923. He shared an interest in slipware with Bernard Leach and {{was influenced by the}} pottery of Shoji Hamada. In 1926 he left St Ives to restart the Greet Potteries at Winchcombe in Gloucestershire. With the help of former chief thrower Elijah Comfort and fourteen-year-old Sydney Tustin, he set about rebuilding the derelict pottery. Cardew aimed to make pottery in the seventeenth century English slipware tradition, functional and affordable by people with moderate incomes. After some experimentation, pottery was made with local clay and fired in a traditional <b>bottle</b> <b>kiln.</b> Charlie Tustin joined the team in 1935 followed in 1936 by Ray Finch, who bought the pottery from Cardew and worked there until he died in 2012. The pottery is now known as Winchcombe Pottery.|$|E
50|$|A.J. Wilkinson (Arthur J. Wilkinson, Royal Staffordshire Pottery) was a pottery or potbank at Newport in Burslem, {{owned by}} the Shorter family since 1894. A {{sprawling}} complex of <b>bottle</b> ovens, <b>kilns</b> and production shops, it lay beside the Trent and Mersey Canal, the artery which provided it with coal and the raw materials for earthenware. In its heyday it employed 400 manual workers.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bottle</b> oven <b>kiln</b> is {{protected}} by an outer hovel which helps to create an updraught. The biscuit kiln was filled with saggars of green flatwares (bedded in flint) by placers. The doors (clammins) were bricked up and then the firing began. Each firing took 14 tons of coal. Fires were lit in the firemouths and baited every four hours. Flames rose up inside the kiln and heat passed between the bungs of saggars. They controlled {{the temperature of the}} firing using dampers in the crown. The firing was monitored by Bullers rings placed in the kiln. A kiln would be fired to 1250C.|$|R
