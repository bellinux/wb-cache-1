5000|$|Teitelbaum opposed {{education}} for girls, opening Satmar's [...] "Beis Ruchl" [...] school network only <b>because</b> he feared <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he did not, many parents would send their daughters to [...] "Beis Yaakov".|$|R
5000|$|The attacks {{themselves}} {{might have}} changed the electoral winner. A sufficient number of voters suddenly decided {{to vote for the}} Socialist party <b>because</b> they thought <b>that</b> <b>if</b> it won, Islamist terrorism would be placated.|$|R
60|$|He {{took out}} his wallet and held up the checks, keeping, however, {{a firm grip on}} them, <b>because</b> he knew <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Carmen meant to fight for her lover she would not be scrupulous.|$|R
30|$|Note {{that the}} overall {{priorities}} are different but the ranks and the normalized priorities are the same in Tables  5 and 6, but they need not be. Frequently people prefer to use the answer in Table  6, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> way <b>if</b> more cars are added each is compared only with the ideal for that criterion and the rank of the three initial alternatives stays the same.|$|R
5000|$|We in TRADOC...decided {{to put the}} TOW on the MICV <b>because</b> we {{realized}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we did not put the TOW on the MICV, we would probably never have a MICV. General Don Starry, Army magazine, 1987.|$|R
6000|$|And {{for some}} reason Miriam and Mrs. Larkins were sobbing, and Annie was looking grave. Hadn't they after all wanted him to marry her? <b>Because</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> was the case--! ...|$|R
5000|$|We have {{dubbed the}} {{associated}} results NFL theorems <b>because</b> they demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>if</b> an algorithm performs well {{on a certain}} class of problems then it necessarily pays for that with degraded performance {{on the set of}} all remaining problems.|$|R
50|$|The {{song was}} later used in Crystal Pepsi {{commercials}} between 1992 and 1993. Eddie {{said that he}} agreed to license the song to PepsiCo <b>because</b> he knew <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he did not, the company would hire studio musicians to record a cover.|$|R
5000|$|... "In {{some ways}} it was {{probably}} the most stupid thing I ever did <b>because</b> I'm sure <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I have been banned from television, that's why. I used to be on Blue Peter and all those things, regularly, and it all, pffffft, stopped." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "For us, it {{was very}} {{important}} to win here now against Djokovic, <b>because</b> we knew <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he won again, the fourth one, then (Rafa) completing a Grand Slam of losses would have been ugly, and we were very close to doing that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am a reformer; I {{desire to}} see {{sweeping}} changes; I want a good, wise, and honest government; and I desire these things <b>because</b> I fear <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> they do not come peacefully they will come in a tempest of lawlessness and vengeance." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the conservative Russian newspaper Molodaya Gvardiya in 1991, he claims that the only reason he lost was because [...] "younger Party leaders, such as Yegor Ligachev, supported Gorbachev <b>because</b> they feared <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I had become Party boss, they would lose their posts." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} episode, vampires' clothes reflect the {{era in which}} they died. Joss Whedon felt this concept was a [...] "charming notion" [...] but {{rejected}} it <b>because</b> he believed <b>that</b> <b>if</b> every vampire in the show were dressed in old-fashioned clothes they would cease to be scary.|$|R
60|$|Colville {{got himself}} out of the comfort and quiet of Mrs. Bowen's house as soon as he could. He made the more haste <b>because</b> he felt <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he could have {{remained}} with the smallest trace of self-respect, he would have been glad to stay there for ever.|$|R
50|$|Older-style metro {{cards are}} not linked with {{personal}} data or usage {{data in a}} central database and thus they guarantee anonymity of the travel. <b>Because</b> of <b>that,</b> however, <b>if</b> a metro card is lost or damaged, the traveler cannot be reimbursed for the unused trips.|$|R
50|$|He {{decided to}} come out in the open about his HIV-positive status <b>because</b> he {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he talked about it with someone that person might use it against him and also knowing the type discrimination surrounding people living with HIV/AIDS that also compelled him to reveal his HIV status.|$|R
40|$|Such {{fundamental}} change is critical, <b>because</b> history teaches <b>that</b> <b>if</b> reform is to last, it must change the systems and values to which officers adhere {{rather than just}} the officers themselves (Skolnick and Fyfe, 1993 : 187). ” Police-initiated stops of citizens have become an established crime-control tactic in man...|$|R
50|$|In 1672, the Assembly of Albemarle {{sent the}} governor, Peter Carteret, to England {{to ask the}} Lords Proprietors not to collect the taxes {{required}} by the Navigation Acts. But the Proprietors refused — in part <b>because</b> they feared <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they didn’t enforce the laws, their charter might be revoked.|$|R
5000|$|Prathyangira is also {{mentioned}} in the Hindu epic Ramayana. Indrajit was performing [...] "Nikumbala yaga" [...] (a sacred ritual to worship Prathyangira) [...] while Rama and his soldiers were waging war in Lanka. Hanuman came down to stop this ritual <b>because</b> he knew <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Indrajit completed it, he would become invincible.|$|R
50|$|The 'Direct Action' was {{announced}} by the Muslim League Council to show the strength of Muslim feelings both to British and Congress <b>because</b> Muslims feared <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the British just pulled out, Muslims would surely suffer {{at the hands of}} overwhelming Hindu majority, which resulted in the worst communal riots that British India had seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, father, hath not the rascal {{you speak}} of {{deserved}} well of us? Can we not guess that even originally he took me away from Haarlem, only <b>because</b> he knew <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he refused the bargain, proposed to him by mine own brother, Stoutenburg would have found some other means of ensuring my silence." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{public has}} grown to {{understand}} the situation. Every reasonable business man is willing to sit and wait half an hour for a shave which he could give himself in three minutes, <b>because</b> he knows <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he goes down town without understanding exactly why Chicago lost two games straight he will appear an ignoramus.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{never thought}} there was much danger of <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> even <b>if</b> they were on board they would see that you and I, being always together, could not be got rid of without an alarm being given." ...|$|R
40|$|Because the Hardy-Weinberg {{principle}} {{tells us}} what to expect concerning the genetic com-position of a sample when no evolutionary forces are operating, {{one of the first}} questions population geneticists often ask is “Are the genotypes in this sample present in the expected, i. e., Hardy-Weinberg, proportions? ” We ask <b>that</b> question <b>because</b> we know <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the geno...|$|R
5000|$|... full of {{inaccuracies}} and {{the selection}} leaves {{much to be}} desired. Between one third {{and a half of}} the dates are wrong <b>because</b> Giles supposed <b>that</b> <b>if</b> somebody is recorded as having died in 1200 aged 63 he or she must have been born in 1137 (in most cases 1138 would have been a better guess).|$|R
5000|$|Tip O'Neill (Speaker from 1977-1987): According to John Feehery, a Hastert {{aide and}} speechwriter {{who coined the}} term [...] "majority of the majority," [...] O'Neill let the Republicans [...] "run the floor" [...] because he didn't have the votes and <b>because</b> he {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he gave President Ronald Reagan [...] "enough rope, he would end up strangling himself." ...|$|R
3000|$|The optimal {{base stock}} level of process 1 {{is less than}} 2. It is <b>because</b> <b>that</b> by (1), <b>if</b> the {{inventory}} level of process 1 is positive, then the starting epoch for processing an item in process 2 ordered by demand information is [...] t_ 1 periods later from the start time for process 1 ordered by the same order.|$|R
50|$|All {{the schools}} that he put up in his home {{province}} of Bohol is Admiral Cloma’s way of providing opportunities and hope for ambitious and determined young people in Bohol, and more importantly, in looking back to his roots <b>because</b> he knew <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{he was able to}} succeed in life armed only with hard work, determination and perseverance, then anybody else can.|$|R
50|$|Rules 12(g) and 12(h) {{are also}} {{important}} <b>because</b> they state <b>that</b> <b>if</b> 12(b)(2)-12(b)(5) motions are not properly bundled together or included in an answer/allowable amendment to an answer, they are waived. Additionally, because 12(b)(1) motions are so fundamental, they may never be waived {{throughout the course of}} litigation, and 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(7) motions may be filed at any time until trial ends.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1947, Oggins {{was sentenced to death}} <b>because</b> Stalin feared <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the spy were repatriated to the United States, as the US {{government}} had requested, he would defect and reveal Soviet secrets. Oggins was taken to Laboratory Number One (the [...] "Kamera"), where Grigory Mairanovsky injected him with the poison curare, which takes 10-15 minutes to kill.|$|R
5000|$|We {{ran down}} the middle of the bridge, {{shouting}} as we went. I didn't stop <b>because</b> I knew <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I kept moving they couldn't hit me. My men were in squad column and not one of them was hit. We took cover in some bomb craters. Then we just sat and waited for others to come. That's the way it was.|$|R
5000|$|Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 {{star rating}} out of 5, stating: [...] "'The Other Side' sets its {{procedural}} story up as one large {{metaphor for the}} upcoming drama that is about to unfold. I just wish the killer kid story hadn't been used back-to-back. Thankfully, Pierce being the culprit isn't the main takeaway from the story - it's his genetics. Pierce is half Lowen-half Genio Innocuo, and, <b>because</b> of <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> he can't keep his emotions in check his violent side comes out. It's a light twist to what Renard is going through." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{likewise}} directed, “that every {{senator in}} the great council of a nation, after he had delivered his opinion, and argued in the defence of it, should be obliged to give his vote directly contrary; <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> were done, the result would infallibly terminate in {{the good of the}} public.” ...|$|R
50|$|Ted {{returns to}} the club to {{retrieve}} his phone, which he had left behind. He doesn’t find it, but he grabs an abandoned yellow umbrella and walks home in the rain. Future Ted reveals that his eventual wife {{had been at the}} club that night, but they did not meet and he's glad <b>because</b> he knows <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they had, she would not have liked him.|$|R
5000|$|In December 1983, when GMHC {{was housed}} in rundown brownstone and served 250 people with AIDS, McFarlane lamented the inequitable {{treatment}} of gays by society at large, noting how [...] "We {{were forced to}} take care of ourselves <b>because</b> we learned <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you have certain diseases, certain lifestyles, you can't expect the same services as other parts of society". McFarlane served as executive director until 1985.|$|R
