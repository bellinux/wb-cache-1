On 19 September, Hitler ordered that no further barges were to be added to Sea Lion ports, but those under assembly were to continue.

5|$|Gasketball was {{developed}} and produced by Mikengreg, an Iowa-based two-man team: Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. After releasing their first game, the sport-inspired Solipskier for iPhone and iPad, Boxleiter and Wohlwend lived off the profits for two years while working on Gasketball, paying themselves their same salaries from their Adobe Flash development days but having the security to try new ideas. Wohlwend made somewhat more income due to other collaborations, such as Puzzlejuice with Asher Vollmer, but shared his income with Boxleiter. Development began in mid 2011. Even though Solipskier was successful, the duo {{did not have a}} following comparable to indie developers like Team Meat and thus did not feel pressured to meet high expectations. Instead, their pressure was internal. Wohlwend said he worked 100-hour weeks with no weekends or vacations while living on the Solipskier funds. When they ran out of money, Boxleiter borrowed money from his parents, and eventually they <b>both</b> <b>went</b> homeless, living on the couches of friends.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} five seasons, Massillon lost only one game, a 7–0 defeat at New Castle, Pennsylvania in 1937 after several players {{came down with}} the flu. As the Tigers' {{prestige}} grew, Brown in 1936 convinced the school {{to build a new}} stadium almost triple the size of the existing 7,000-seat facility. The stadium was finished in 1939, and is now named after Brown. The pinnacle of Brown's career at Massillon was a victory in the 1940 season against Toledo's Waite High School. The Tigers and Waite <b>both</b> <b>went</b> undefeated in the 1939 season, and both claimed the state championship. The teams decided to settle the score the following year, and Brown's team won 28–0. The Massillon 1940 squad is still regarded by historians {{as one of the best}} in the history of state high school football.|$|E
5|$|Iowa State got {{the ball}} to start the game. Their first drive was {{highlighted}} by a 26–yard pass from Sam Richardson to Josh Lenz. The drive totaled 9 plays and 56 yards and culminated with a 33–yard field goal by Edwin Arceo. Tulsa and Iowa State exchanged punts on their next two drives. When Tulsa {{got the ball}} back again, Trey Watts rushed the ball for four yards on the first play of the drive, and then Cody Green threw a short pass that was intercepted by defensive back Jeremy Reeves and returned 31 {{yards for a touchdown}} that put Tulsa up 10–0. Tulsa then put together a 9–play, 75–yard drive during which all three running backs: Alex Singleton, Ja'Terian Douglas, and Trey Watts rushed the ball. It was Singleton who rushed for a two-yard touchdown that made the score 10-7. Iowa State's next drive lasted only two plays, but the second was a 69–yard pass from Richardson to tight end Ernst Brun Jr. for a touchdown. The final two drives of the quarter <b>both</b> <b>went</b> three-and-out.|$|E
5|$|King {{made contact}} with Canamasas in the fourth corner while driving {{alongside}} him during lap four. <b>Both</b> <b>went</b> off the circuit, with Canamasas sustaining front wing damage, which stopped his car. He became the race's second (and final) retirement. King continued but rejoined in 12th. Leal's pace had slowed due to tyre degradation. This allowed Haryanto to close up to Leal who passed him by deploying DRS {{to move into the}} lead around the inside on lap eight in turn one. Evans attempted to move in front of Leal but ran wide, allowing the latter to retake the second position. Visoiu took advantage and overtook Leal for second place. Evans again drove aggressively but Leal was defensive and his front wing endplate glanced Evans' front-left tyre at the turn eight hairpin. Evans drove to the pit lane for replacement tyres. Leal remained on the track, but was overtaken by Visoiu for second at the first corner on lap 10. Rossi moved ahead of Leal for sixth place, while King recovered to run in ninth position.|$|E

5|$|Since Arsenal's first {{competitive}} match, {{more than}} 500 players {{have failed to}} reach 25 appearances for the club. Many of these players have spent only {{a short period of}} their career at Arsenal before seeking opportunities in other teams; some players had their careers cut short by injury, while others left for other reasons. John Kosmina, who joined from Adelaide City in 1978, only made four appearances for Arsenal, before returning to his native Australia where his goalscoring record was prolific. Vladimir Petrović featured 22 times as an Arsenal first-teamer, and later forged a managerial career, coaching Red Star Belgrade and the Serbia national team. Andy Cole, who played one league match as a youngster for Arsenal, moved to Newcastle United where he won the Premier League Golden Boot in 1993–94, and enjoyed further success at Manchester United in the mid-to-late 1990s. David Bentley and Rohan Ricketts left Arsenal in pursuit of first-team football, and <b>both</b> <b>went</b> on to play for Tottenham Hotspur at certain stages of their careers.|$|E

Geethanjali was critically acclaimed and won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment in 1990.

Mani maintained a momentum of making emotional stories of under-served people through the film Anjali in 1990, which starred Raghuvaran and told the story of an autistic child who changed the lives of people around her. The film proved to be a commercial success and was nominated as India's official entry to the Oscars in the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 63rd Academy Awards.
