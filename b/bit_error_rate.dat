40|$|The {{congestion}} control mechanism in TCP introduces idle transmit periods {{as a result}} of its small transmission window and exponential retransmission timer. This behavior occurs while recovering from packet losses, due to wireless LAN link errors. Therefore, TCP suffers from low throughput due to poor utilization of the available bandwidth, while recovering from high <b>bit</b> <b>error</b> <b>rates.</b> TCP Noor`s Aggressive Error Recovery (AER) avoids the idle transmit periods while recovering from high <b>Bit</b> <b>Error</b> <b>Rates</b> (BER). Enhanced AER (EAER) applies further enhancement to AER which provides higher averaged Throughput during variable <b>bit</b> <b>error</b> <b>rates</b> on the channel. EAER applies a dynamic mechanism, which allows TCP`s transmission behavior to adjust based on the channel conditions. Simulation results indicate that TCP Noor`s EAER gains up to two 250 % increase in throughput over TCP Reno while recovering from variable <b>bit</b> <b>error</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

40|$|Reduction of <b>bit</b> <b>error</b> <b>rates</b> in optical {{transmission}} systems {{is an important}} task {{that is difficult to}} achieve. As speeds increase, the difficulty in reducing <b>bit</b> <b>error</b> <b>rates</b> also increases. Channels have differing characteristics, which may change over time, and any error correction employed must be capable of operating at extremely high speeds. In this paper, a linear support vector machine is used to classify large-scale data sets of simulated {{optical transmission}} data in order to demonstrate their effectiveness at reducing <b>bit</b> <b>error</b> <b>rates</b> and their adaptability to the specifics of each channel.

40|$|Currently {{there is}} no control for {{real-time}} traffic sources in IP networks. This {{is a serious problem}} because real-time traffic can not only congest the network but can also cause unfairness and starvation of TCP traffic. In this paper, a new rate control scheme, RCS, is introduced for real-time traffic in networks with high bandwidth-delay products and high <b>bit</b> <b>error</b> <b>rates.</b> RCS is based on the concept of using dummy packets to probe the availability of network resources. Dummy packets are treated as low priority packets and consequently they do not affect the throughput of actual data traffic. Therefore, RCS requires all the routers in the connection path to support some priority policy. Simulation experiments show that in environments with high bandwidth-delay products and high <b>bit</b> <b>error</b> <b>rates,</b> RCS achieves good throughput performance without penalizing TCP connections.
