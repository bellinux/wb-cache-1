40|$|ABSTRACT: The asexually gene {{introduction}} by genetic engineering has brought enormous possibilities to innovate plant breeding. However, principally {{because of the}} low in vitro response, genetic transformation has been restricted to only certain genotypes of agronomically significant species. With the objective of establishing a protocol for genetically transforming the Brazilian BR 451 maize variety through Agrobacterium tumefaciens, it was studied the capacity of plant regeneration in vitro from embryogenic calli cultivated in three regeneration media, each having different growth regulators. It was also evaluated the temperature stress effect on {{the transformation of the}} immature embryos with A. tumefaciens EHA 101 containing the plasmid pTF 102 with uidA and <b>bar</b> genes. The <b>BR</b> 451 variety embryos and those of the Hi-II hybrid (control) were exposed to three treatments applied as they were being infected with the agrobacteria (a) infection at 25 °C; (b) infection at 40 °C; (c) pretreatment at 40 °C for 5 seconds followed by infection at 25 °C. Transformation was determined by uidA gene expression and through the callus resistant to the herbicide Bialaphos® formation. Embryos infected at 40 °C showed a higher degree of genetic transformation in the Hi-II, although the same was not noted in BR 451. When growth regulators were added to the culture medium the number of regenerated BR 451 plants showed no increase...|$|R
40|$|Çetin, Serkant Ali (Dogus Author) A {{search is}} {{performed}} for top-quark pairs (t (t) over bar) produced {{together with a}} photon (gamma) with transverse energy greater than 20 GeV using a sample of t (t) over bar candidate events in final states with jets, missing transverse momentum, and one isolated electron or muon. The data set used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4. 59 fb(- 1) of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. In total, 140 and 222 t (t) over bar gamma candidate events are observed in the electron and muon channels, to {{be compared to the}} expectation of 79 +/- 26 and 120 +/- 39 non-t (t) over bar gamma background events, respectively. The production of t (t) over bar gamma events is observed with a significance of 5. 3 standard deviations away from the null hypothesis. The t (t) over bar gamma production cross section times the branching ratio (BR) of the single-lepton decay channel is measured in a fiducial kinematic region within the ATLAS acceptance. The measured value is sigma(fid) (t (t) over <b>bar</b> gamma) x <b>BR</b> = 63 +/- 8 (stat) (- 13) (+ 17) (syst) +/- 1 (lumi) fb per lepton flavor, in good agreement with the leading-order theoretical calculation normalized to the next-to-leading-order theoretical prediction of 48 +/- 10 fb...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} compare the effects of genotypes, seasons and genotype x season interactions on the laying mortality rates in the Nigerian local chickens (LC), the <b>Barred</b> Plymouth Rock (<b>BR)</b> and their F 1 cross-progenies. The parent-stock was separated into four mating groups to produce four genotypes (G) :- BR x BR (G 1), LC x LC (G 2) BR x LC (G 3) and LC x BR (G 4). The {{experiment was}} conducted during the dry and rainy seasons. Weekly mortality rates were computed for 24 weeks of lay. The data generated from the experiment were subjected to a 2 x 4 x 6 factorial analysis using S. A. S package. The results indicate that G 2 and G 3 with mortality rates (MR) of 1. 91 and 3. 28 respectively performed better than G 1 and G 4 with MR of 5. 17 and 5. 62 respectively. The results further indicate that experimental chickens performed better {{during the dry season}} (MR = 3. 08) than during the rainy season (MR= 4. 91). However, it was observed that the genotype x season interaction did not produce any significant effect on the mortality rates of the chickens. The results from this experiment underscore the need to improve the livability of the laying chickens by developing genotypes which are more tolerant with the local environment and the prevailing season. Based on the results, it was concluded that the mortality rates in the laying chicken can be reduced by crossing the exotic chicken with the local chicken and that a building system could be designed which can help reduce mortality rates during rainy seasons...|$|R
40|$|Uraninite {{solubility}} in 0. 001 – 2. 0 m HCl solutions was experimentally {{studied at}} 500 °C, 1000 bar, and hydrogen fugacity {{corresponding to the}} Ni/NiO buffer. It was shown that the following U(IV) species dominate in the aqueous solution: U(OH) 40, U(OH) 2 Cl 20, and UOH Cl 30 Using the results of uraninite solubility measurement, the Gibbs free energies of U(IV) species at 500 °C and 1000 bar were calculated (kJ/mol) : − 9865. 55 for UO 2 (aq), − 1374. 57 for U(OH) 2 Cl 20, and − 1265. 49 for UOH Cl 30, and the equilibrium constants of uraninite dissolution in water and aqueous HCl solutions were estimated: UO 2 (cr) = UO 2 (aq), pK 0 = 6. 64; UO 2 (cr) + 2 HCl 0 = U(OH) 2 Cl 20, pK 2 = 3. 56; and UO 2 (cr) + 3 HCl 0 = UOHcl 30 + H 2 O, pK 3 = 3. 05. The value pK 1 ≈ 5. 0 was obtained as a first approximation for the equilibrium UO 2 (cr) + H 2 O + HCl 0 = U(OH) 3 Cl 0. The constant of the reaction UO 2 (cr) + 4 HCl 0 = UCl 40 + 2 H 2 O (pK 4 = 7. 02) was calculated {{taking into account the}} ionization constants of U Cl 40 and U(OH) 40, obtained by extrapolation from 25 to 500 °C at 1000 <b>bar</b> using the <b>BR</b> model. Intense dissolution and redeposition of gold (material of experimental capsules) was observed in our experiments. The analysis and modeling of this phenomenon suggested that the UO 2 + x/UO 2 redox pair oxidized Au(cr) to Au+(aq), which was then reduced under the influence of stronger reducers...|$|R
