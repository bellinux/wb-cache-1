40|$|AbstractThere are {{numerous}} approaches to randomizing patients to treatment groups in clinical trials. The most popular is permuted block randomization, and a newer and better class, which is gaining in popularity, {{is the so-called}} class of MTI procedures, which use a big stick to force the allocation sequence back towards balance when it reaches the MTI (maximally tolerated imbalance). Three prominent members of this class are the aptly named big stick procedure, Chen's procedure, and the maximal procedure. As we shall establish in this article, <b>blocked</b> <b>randomization,</b> though not typically cast as an MTI procedure, does in fact use the big stick as well. We shall argue that its weaknesses, which are well known, arise precisely from its improper use, bordering on outright abuse, of this big stick. Just as rocket powered golf clubs add power to a golf swing, so too does the big stick used by <b>blocked</b> <b>randomization</b> hit with too much power. In addition, the big stick is invoked when it need not be, thereby resulting in the excessive prediction for which permuted blocks are legendary. We {{bridge the gap between}} the MTI procedures and block randomization by identifying a new randomization procedure intermediate between the two, namely based on an excessively powerful big stick, but one that is used only when needed. We shall then argue that the MTI procedures are all superior to this intermediate procedure by virtue of using a restrained big stick, and that this intermediate procedure is superior to block randomization by virtue of restraint in when the big stick is invoked. The transitivity property then completes our argument...|$|E

30|$|Patients were {{randomly}} {{divided into two}} groups using a randomization software, where a <b>blocked</b> <b>randomization</b> was used to ascertain equal distribution of patients into each group (parallel-group study) (Vickers 2006).

40|$|When {{planning}} a randomized clinical trial, careful consideration {{must be given}} to how participants are selected for various arms of a study. Selection and accidental bias may occur when participants are not assigned to study groups with equal probability. A simple random allocation scheme is a process by which each participant has equal likelihood of being assigned to treatment versus referent groups. However, by chance an unequal number of individuals may be assigned to each arm of the study and thus decrease the power to detect statistically significant differences between groups. Block randomization is a commonly used technique in clinical trial design to reduce bias and achieve balance in the allocation of participants to treatment arms, especially when the sample size is small. This method increases the probability that each arm will contain an equal number of individuals by sequencing participant assignments by block. Yet still, the allocation process may be predictable, for example, when the investigator is not blind and the block size is fixed.

40|$|Objective Randomized {{controlled}} {{trials are}} the standard method for comparing treatments because they avoid the selection bias that might arise if clinicians {{were free to}} choose which treatment a patient would receive. In practice, allocation of treatments in randomized controlled trials is often not wholly random with various ‘pseudo-randomization’ methods, such as minimization or balanced blocks, used to ensure good balance between treatments within potentially important prognostic or predictive subgroups. These methods avoid selection bias so long as full concealment of the next treatment allocation is maintained. There is concern, however, that pseudo-random methods may allow clinicians to predict future treatment allocations from previous allocation history, particularly if allocations are balanced by clinician or center. We investigate here to what extent treatment prediction is possible.

40|$|MicroRNA arrays {{possess a}} number of unique data {{features}} that challenge the assumption key to many normalization methods. We assessed the performance of existing normalization methods using two microRNA array datasets derived from {{the same set of}} tumor samples: one dataset was generated using a <b>blocked</b> <b>randomization</b> design when assigning arrays to samples and hence was free of confounding array effects; the second dataset was generated without blocking or randomization and exhibited array effects. The randomized dataset was assessed for differential expression between two tumor groups and treated as the benchmark. The non-randomized dataset was assessed for differential expression after normalization and compared against the benchmark. Normalization improved the true positive rate significantly in the non-randomized data but still possessed a false discovery rate as high as 50 %. Adding a batch adjustment step before normalization further reduced the number of false positive markers while maintaining a similar number of true positive markers, which resulted in a false discovery rate of 32 % to 48 %, depending on the specific normalization method. We concluded the paper with some insights on possible causes of false discoveries to shed light on how to improve normalization for microRNA arrays...|$|E

Stratified permuted <b>block</b> <b>randomization</b> and minimization methods [Pocock and Simon Biometrics 31 (1975) 103 - 115, etc. ] are the two most popular approaches in practice. However, stratified permuted <b>block</b> <b>randomization</b> fails to achieve good overall balance when the number of strata is large, whereas traditional minimization methods also suffer from the potential drawback of large within-stratum imbalances. Moreover, the theoretical bases of minimization methods remain largely elusive. In this paper, we propose a new covariate-adaptive design that is able to control various types of imbalances. We show that the joint process of within-stratum imbalances is a positive recurrent Markov chain under certain conditions. Therefore, this new procedure yields more balanced allocation. The advantages of the proposed procedure are also demonstrated by extensive simulation studies. Our work provides a theoretical tool for future research in this area.

Method: This pilot study used a multi-site, <b>blocked</b> <b>randomization</b> design. Twenty-four participants from three LTCFs were recruited, and the participants were randomly assigned into the telerehabilitation (Tele) and conventional therapy (Conv) groups within each LTCF.

The outcome measures included Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Barthel Index (BI), and the telerehabilitation satisfaction of the participants. Setting: A telerehabilitation system included “therapist end” in a laboratory, and the “client end” in LTCFs. The conventional therapy was conducted in LTCFs. Results: Training programs conducted for both the Tele and Conv groups showed significant effects within groups on the participant BBS as well as the total and self-care scores of BI. No significant difference between groups could be demonstrated. The satisfaction of participants between the Tele and the Conv groups also did not show significant difference.

40|$|Abstract Background Frequent rehospitalisations and poorer {{survival}} {{chances in}} heart failure (HF) patients may partly {{be explained by}} poor medication adherence. There are multiple medication-related reasons for suboptimal adherence, but psychological reasons may also be important. A novel TELEmonitoring device may improve MEDication adherence in HF patients (TELEMED-HF). TELEMED-HF is a randomized, controlled clinical intervention trial designed to examine (1) the efficacy and cost-efficiency of an electronic medication adherence support system in improving and monitoring HF patients' medication adherence; (2) the effect of medication adherence on hospitalizations and health care consumption; {{as well as on}} (3) clinical characteristics, and Quality of Life (QoL); and (4) clinical, sociodemographic, and psychological determinants of medication adherence. Methods/Design Consecutive patients with chronic, systolic HF presenting to the outpatient clinic of the TweeSteden Hospital, The Netherlands, will be approached for study participation and randomly assigned (1 : 1) following <b>blocked</b> <b>randomization</b> procedures to the intervention (n = 200) or usual care arm (n = 200). Patients in the intervention arm use the medication support device for six months in addition to usual care. Post-intervention, patients return to usual care only and all patients participate in four follow-up occasions over 12 months. Primary endpoints comprise objective and subjective medication adherence, healthcare consumption, number of hospitalizations, and cost-effectiveness. Secondary endpoints include disease severity, physical functioning, and QoL.
