40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} and investigate the concepts of new deployable boom systems, which consist of the BCON (braid coated bi-convex tape) boom and the SMA-BCON (braid coated bi-shape memory alloy convex tape) boom. Both booms are developed for the deployable membrane structures such as solar sails, thin membrane solar array panels, deorbit mechanisms for small satellites and reflectors of space solar power satellite, etc. BCON booms can store around polygonal or cylindrical center hub, and the booms can deploy by the stepwise manner by releasing a constraint mechanism which pins the boons into two or three points for the total length. SMA-BCON booms are mainly developed for a square center body systems, and SMA is adapted on the <b>bent</b> <b>points</b> of the booms where stored around each edge of the center hub. Through the deployment experiments of both booms, the stepwise deployment behavior and its tendency are obtained. The design concept of BCON boom and SMA-BCON boom is demonstrated through this study...|$|R
5000|$|It was not {{uncommon}} at this time for white men living in the area, usually working as traders or trappers, to take a Native American wife. Often these relationships lasted only until the men left the frontier territory, but while they existed they were of mutual benefit. Bent and Owl Woman's relationship, however, was a partnership that ultimately [...] "resulted in children, wealth and power." [...] From <b>Bent's</b> <b>point</b> of view, marriage to a Cheyenne would not merely provide him with female companionship and a social escort for functions held at the fort but, perhaps more importantly, reinforce an alliance with the tribe {{that would be a}} useful adjunct to his burgeoning trading activities. From the perspective of White Thunder, it would bolster his tribe's already friendly relationship with Bent and thus provide protection for them, and on a more personal level it would re-establish some of his prestige within the tribe itself.|$|R

30|$|Having stated {{a number}} of the {{setbacks}} and limitations of the earlier fracture model techniques, the current modified device used in this study takes into account those issues and the importance of soft tissue surrounding the fracture. Our current modified three <b>point</b> bending <b>pliers</b> used to create the closed bone fractures was constructed by modifying the upper circle compressed jaw of the Otto et al. (1995) device according to the compressor blade of the Grieff, (1978) device with dimensions of 10  mm X 1  mm (Fig. 1). In addition, the gap distance of the two support jaws of the three-point bending pliers was reduced to 7  mm instead of 17  mm as in the Otto et al. (1995) device. Using this modified device resulted in a fracture without any significant damage or effects on the surrounding soft tissue. The device was easy to use and control, and the IM pin prefixed before the fracture served to stabilize the bone fragments and enables the animals to immediately regain their ambulatory function. Even though the prefixed IM could not provide rigid stabilization to the fractured bone, it could minimize the bone comminution during the fracture {{and at the same time}} could resolve the problem of post fracture limb shortening and rotation of bone fragments (Omerovic et al., 2015) in rats.|$|R

6000|$|... "'It seems,' I said, 'from what I {{heard the}} white hakim say, {{that the blood}} flowed through those little white tubes. By {{twisting}} the tourniquet very tight, that flow of blood is stopped. The great thing is to find those little tubes, and tie them up. As you would notice, the large ones in {{the inside of the}} arm could be seen quite plainly. When they cannot be seen, the screw is unloosed so as to allow a small quantity of blood to flow, which shows you where the tubes are. You will remember that I took hold of each, with the <b>bent</b> <b>point</b> of a small wire or a pair of these nippers; and, while you held it, tied the thread tightly round it. When that is done, one is ready to cut the bone. You saw me push the flesh back, so as to cut the bone as high up as possible; that is because the white doctor said the flesh would shrink up, and the bone would project. I cut the flesh straight on one side, and on the other with a flap that will, when it is stitched, cover over the bone {{and the rest of the}} flesh, and make what the hakim called a pad. He said all cutting off of limbs was done in this way, but of course the tubes would not lie in the same place, and the cutting would have to be made differently; but it was all the same system. He called these simple operations, and said that anyone with a firm hand, and a knowledge of where these tubes lie, ought to be able to do it, after seeing it done once or twice. He said, of course, it would not be so neatly done as by men who had been trained to it; but that, in cases of extreme necessity, anyone who had seen it done once or twice, and had sufficient nerve, could do it; especially if they had, ready at hand, this stuff that makes the wounded man sleep and feel no pain.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} not injure ones toes while {{executing}} this kick, {{it is usually}} delivered through the front base of the foot (ap chook), if not with the flat upperside of the foot (bal deung). If performed with the bare foot then the ball of the foot is used on impact with the toes drawn up to prevent injury. To strike with ap chook one has to raise one's toes so that their tips {{will not be the}} first contact point. Even when directed forward, this is not a kick where the first contact point should be the base of the heel, as is considered beneficial in some other martial arts having a similar kick. In Taekwondo, one would strike forward with the ankle extended, so that the upperside of the foot forms a straight line with the shin, and with the toes <b>bent</b> back (<b>pointing</b> up).
