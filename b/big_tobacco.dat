2500|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, {{politicians}} {{of the ruling}} Malawi Congress Party were involved in tobacco growing on the former European estates that the colonial government had bought, and which were sold or leased to the party elite after independence. Further elite-run estates were later created on previously communal lands. By 1990, there were 675,000 registered estate tenants with little security, and another 580,000 “squatters” lived on surplus land with no security, forming a pool of casual labour. Few tenants or squatters grew all their own food and most relied on casual paid labour or food-for-work arrangements on the estates to supplement what they could grow. The preferred term for short-term rural casual work paid for in cash or in kind (usually food) is ganyu. The term [...] "Ganyu" [...] is said to derive from the Portuguese [...] "ganho" [...] (sometimes spelled [...] "ganyao") meaning something gained or a bonus. It originally denoted food or beer given as appreciation for neighbours when they worked on another’s fields, then the work a poor person did for food or cash for more prosperous neighbour. Today tobacco estates are the largest employers of ganyu workers. These may stay for the growing season like visiting tenants, or travel in daily. Larger estates may pay the minimum wage; smaller estates usually only give food. These arrangements are sometimes called thangata, as in the 2007 documentary “Thangata: social bondage and <b>big</b> <b>tobacco</b> in Malawi”.|$|E
