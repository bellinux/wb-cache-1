25|$|Produced {{mainly in}} parts of the world where pineapples are grown, such as Thailand or Malaysia, <b>bromelain</b> is {{extracted}} from the peel, stem, leaves or waste of the pineapple plant after processing the fruit for juice or other purposes. The starting material is blended and pressed through a filter to obtain a supernatant liquid containing the soluble <b>bromelain</b> enzyme. Further processing includes purification and concentration of the enzyme.|$|E

25|$|Systemic enzyme therapy (consisting of {{combinations}} of proteolytic enzymes such as <b>bromelain,</b> trypsin, chymotrypsin, and papain) {{has been investigated}} in Europe to evaluate the efficacy in breast, colorectal, and plasmacytoma cancer patients.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bromelain</b> {{is present}} {{in all parts of}} the {{pineapple}} plant (Ananas sp.), but the stem is the most common commercial source, presumably because usable quantities are readily extractable after the fruit has been harvested.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{quantity}} of <b>bromelain</b> in a typical serving of pineapple fruit is probably not significant, specific extraction can yield sufficient quantities for domestic and industrial processing, including uses in baking, anti-browning of cut fruit, textiles and cosmetics manufacturing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bromelain</b> is {{an enzyme}} extract {{derived from the}} stems of pineapples, {{although}} it exists {{in all parts of}} the fresh plant and fruit. The extract has a history of folk medicine use. As a culinary ingredient, it may be used as a meat tenderizer.|$|E
25|$|Digestive enzyme {{supplements}} may {{significantly reduce}} the amount of flatulence caused by some components of foods not being digested by the body and thereby promoting the action of microbes in the small and large intestines. It has been suggested that alpha-galactosidase enzymes, which can digest certain complex sugars, are effective in reducing the volume and frequency of flatus. The enzymes alpha-galactosidase, lactase, amylase, lipase, protease, cellulase, glucoamylase, invertase, malt diastase, pectinase, and <b>bromelain</b> are available, either individually or in combination blends, in commercial products.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bromelain</b> extract is {{a mixture}} of protein-digesting (proteolytic) enzymes and several other {{substances}} in smaller quantities.

2500|$|After {{an hour at}} 50째C (122째F), 83% of {{the enzyme}} remains, while at 40째C (104째F), {{practically}} 100% remains. [...] The proteolytic activity of concentrated <b>bromelain</b> solutions remains relatively stable for at least 1 week at room temperature, with minimal inactivation by multiple freeze-thaw cycles or exposure to the digestive enzyme trypsin.|$|E
2500|$|While {{there have}} been studies which {{positively}} correlated the use of <b>bromelain</b> with reduction of symptom severity in osteoarthritis, [...] "he majority of the studies have methodological issues that {{make it difficult to}} draw definite conclusions", as none definitively established efficacy, recommended dosage, long term safety, or adverse interaction with other medications.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bromelain</b> has {{not been}} scientifically proven to be {{effective}} in treating any other diseases and it {{has not been}} approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of any disorder. In the United States, the passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA, 1994) allows the sale of bromelain-containing dietary supplements even though efficacy has not been confirmed.|$|E
2500|$|Consumption {{of foods}} which are {{themselves}} vasodilators, such as alcoholic beverages or cinnamon, {{can increase the}} probability of an angioedema episode in susceptible patients. [...] If the episode occurs at all after the consumption of these foods, its onset may be delayed overnight or by some hours, making the correlation with their consumption somewhat difficult. In contrast, consumption of <b>bromelain</b> in combination with turmeric may be beneficial in reducing symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|Pineapples {{have a long}} {{tradition}} as a medicinal plant among the natives of South and Central America. The first isolation of <b>bromelain</b> was recorded by the Venezuelan chemist Vicente Marcano in 1891 by fermenting the fruit of pineapple. In 1892, Russell Henry Chittenden, assisted by Elliott P. Joslin and Frank Sherman Meara, investigated the matter more completely, and called it 'bromelin'. Later, the term 'bromelain' was introduced and originally [...] applied to any protease from {{any member of the}} plant family Bromeliaceae.|$|E

50|$|If having {{sufficient}} <b>bromelain</b> content, raw {{pineapple juice}} {{may be useful}} as a meat marinade and tenderizer. Although pineapple enzymes can interfere with the preparation of some foods or manufactured products, such as gelatin-based desserts or gel capsules, their proteolytic activity responsible for such properties may be degraded during cooking and canning. The quantity of <b>bromelain</b> in a typical serving of pineapple fruit is probably not significant, but specific extraction can yield sufficient quantities for domestic and industrial processing.|$|E

50|$|Stem <b>bromelain</b> (SBM) (EC 3.4.22.32), a {{proteolytic}} enzyme, is {{a widely}} accepted phytotherapeutical drug member of the <b>bromelain</b> family of proteolytic enzymes obtained from Ananas comosus. Some of the therapeutic benefits of SBM are reversible inhibition of platelet aggregation, angina pectoris, bronchitis, sinusitis, surgical traumas, thrombophlebitis, pyelonephritis and enhanced absorption of drugs, particularly of antibiotics. Its anti-metastasis and anti-inflammatory activities are apparently independent of its proteolytic activity. Although poorly understood, the diverse pleiotrophic effects of SBM seem to depend {{on its ability to}} traverse the membrane barrier, a very unusual property of this protein.|$|E
