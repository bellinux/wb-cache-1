5|$|Hematomas, also focal lesions, are {{collections}} {{of blood in}} or around the brain that can result from hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage, with bleeding in the brain tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Epidural hematoma involves bleeding into the area <b>between</b> <b>the</b> skull and the dura mater, the outermost of the three membranes surrounding the brain. In subdural hematoma, bleeding occurs <b>between</b> <b>the</b> dura and the arachnoid mater. Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding into the space <b>between</b> <b>the</b> arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. Intraventricular hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in the ventricles.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>between</b> part of <b>the</b> {{decomposition}} is the Theil index, {{calculated using}} subgroup mean wages w_k instead of actual incomes. The computation of <b>the</b> <b>between</b> component follows <b>the</b> logic of replacing actual wages {{in each group}} with the average wage of the group. In particular, I calculate mean wages separately for formal and for informal workers, and I then replace each actual individual wage with the mean wage of the group the individual belongs to. <b>The</b> <b>between</b> term then computes the Theil index of this fictitious wage distribution. Since wages are all equal and they only differ <b>between</b> groups, <b>the</b> Theil of this fictitious distribution captures the dispersion of wages attributable to <b>the</b> difference <b>between</b> formal and informal workers, that is, the between-group component of total wage inequality.|$|R
