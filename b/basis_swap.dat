50|$|A <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> is an {{interest}} rate swap which involves the exchange of two floating rate financial instruments. A <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> functions as a floating-floating interest rate swap under which the floating rate payments are referenced to different bases.|$|E

50|$|In addition, an {{increase}} in LIBOR means that financial instruments with variable interest terms are increasingly expensive. For example, car loans and credit card interest rates are often tied to LIBOR; some estimate as much as $150 trillion in loans and derivatives are tied to LIBOR. Furthermore, the <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> between one-month LIBOR and three-month LIBOR increased from 30 basis points {{in the beginning of}} September to a high of over 100 basis points. Financial institutions with liability exposure to 1 month LIBOR but funding from 3 month LIBOR faced increased funding costs. Overall, higher interest rates place additional downward pressure on consumption, increasing the risk of recession.|$|E

40|$|Objective of {{the study}} The {{objective}} {{of the study}} is to investigate how credit risk, liquidity and news about macroeconomic factors affect to Euribor <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> spreads. Euribor <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> spreads should trade in flat in order to no-arbitrage condition to hold. However, during the current financial crisis spreads have increased significantly. I will regard euro countries’ and Euribor panel banks’ credit default swap spreads as a credit risk component and the actions of the European Central Bank as a factors of liquidity component. Data and methods The study is empirical and will be based on linear regression and co-integration analysis. Data consist of time-series data from July 2008 to December 2011. I will first investigate relations between explanatory variables and 3 month versus 12 month Euribor <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> spreads with 2 and 5 year maturities using descriptive statistics. After that, I will present proper empirical test results. In first phase, I will use unit root tests to see are time-series stationary. After they are stated to be stationary in differences and log-differences I will proceed to conduct short-run linear regression tests using ordinary least squares estimation. Finally, I will conduct Engle-Granger and Johansen co-integration tests in order to find out is there long run relationship between the explanatory variables and Euribor <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> spreads. Results Results are in some sense twofold. Ordinary least squares provide rather different test results than co-integration tests for the short-run. In the long-run, I found only one robust co-integrating relation when applying both co integration methods. The relation was between Euribor <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> spreads and Eurobond yield. In the shortrun I found five significant factors that could model the movements of Euribor <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> spreads. The coefficients of determination were 30 per cent (2 year) and 25 per cent (5 year). Based on OLS results I could accept my initial hypothesis about significant components being credit risk, liquidity and news about macroeconomic variables.

50|$|There is no {{consensus}} on the scope of naming convention for different types of IRS. Even a wide description of IRS contracts only includes those whose legs are denominated in the same currency. It is generally accepted that swaps of similar nature whose legs are denominated in different currencies are called cross currency <b>basis</b> <b>swaps.</b> Swaps which are determined on a floating rate index in one currency but whose payments are denominated in another currency are called quantos.|$|R
50|$|Float leg versus float leg swaps {{are much}} more common. These are {{typically}} termed (single currency) <b>basis</b> <b>swaps</b> (SBSs). The legs on SBSs will necessarily be different interest indexes, such as 1M, LIBOR, 3M LIBOR, 6M LIBOR, SONIA, etc. The pricing of these swaps requires a spread often quoted in basis points {{to be added to}} one of the floating legs in order to satisfy value equivalence.|$|R

Correlation exposure can be partially hedged with correlation swaps.|$|R
30|$|Then, we can compute value {{adjustments}} via solutions of a “pre-default” BSDE using {{the framework of}} Crépey (2015 a,b). As an illustration, we design and calibrate an affine LIBOR model, and consider a simple post-crisis interest rate derivative, namely a <b>basis</b> <b>swap.</b> Using the methodology outlined above, we derive {{the dynamics of the}} short rate and of the <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> using an interpolating function, and compute the {{value adjustments}} for different specifications of the contract. As the choice of an interpolating function is still arbitrary, we study the model risk associated to different choices.|$|E
30|$|The typical {{example of}} an {{interest}} rate swap is where a floating rate is exchanged for a fixed rate; see, e.g., Musiela and Rutkowski (2005, § 9.4). The appearance of significant spreads between rates of different tenors {{has given rise to}} a new kind of interest rate swap, called <b>basis</b> <b>swap,</b> where two streams of floating payments linked to underlying rates of different tenors are exchanged. As an example, in a 3 M- 6 M <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> linked to the LIBOR, the 3 -month LIBOR is paid quarterly and the 6 -month LIBOR is received semiannually.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} the factors affecting Euribor <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> spreads. Variables are divided into three component; liquidity risk, credit risk, and macroeconomic and monetary policy. The Euribor <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> was close to zero basis points, but during the early phases of the latest financial crises the spreads jumped. In empirical part of the study, the stationarity of the variables is tested. In the next step, Phillips-Ouliaris (P-O) co-integration test is tested to get 5 combinations that co-integrates with Euribor <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> spread 3 month versus 12 month with 5 years to maturity. Thirdly, long-run equilibrium for the Models with Engle-Granger test is applied. Out of the five Models, picked in P-O, only three had long-run equilibrium. From the three long-run equilibrium Models the regression residuals are saved and estimated short-term equilibrium with Error Correction Model. At the end, Ordinary Least Square method with Newey-West corrections with the three co-integrated Models is tested. The variables for liquidity risk component are Open Market Operations, Aggregate Liquidity Factors, Deposit Facility, and Governing Council Meeting day -dummy. The variables for the credit risk component are Eurobond yield and Bank Credit Default Swap spread. The variables for the macroeconomic and monetary policy component are Euro Overnight-Index Average and exchange rate. The results show that the biggest determinants for the Euribor <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> spread 3 m vs 12 m 5 y are Open Market Operations, Meeting day, Eurobond yield 5 y, Bank CDS, EONIA, and exchange rate of China...|$|E
5000|$|It is well {{recognized}} that traditional [...] "textbook" [...] theory does not price cross currency (<b>basis)</b> <b>swaps</b> correctly, because it assumes the funding cost in each currency {{to be equal}} to its floating rate, thus always giving a zero cross currency spread.

In reality, market participants have different levels of access to funds in different currencies and therefore their funding costs are not always equal to LIBOR.|$|R

40|$|The {{spillover}} {{of money}} market turbulence to FX swap and cross-currency swap markets 1 We analyse the spillover of {{the turmoil in}} money markets {{in the second half}} of 2007 to FX swap and long-term cross-currency <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> markets. We find that the use of swap markets to overcome US dollar funding shortages by non-US financial institutions resulted in marked deviations from covered interest parity conditions and the impairment of liquidity in these markets. JEL classification: G 12, G 14, G 15. Foreign exchange (FX) and related derivatives markets are some of the most liquid markets in the world. The growth of interest rate and FX/currency swaps is often cited as a factor promoting the further integration of global financial markets. This article documents the spillover of the turmoil in money markets {{in the second half of}} 2007, particularly in the US dollar, euro and sterling, to FX swap and cross-currency <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> markets. Our analysis of swap market deviations from covered interest parity and the impairment of liquidity in the swap markets is consistent with anecdotal market observations that dollar funding shortages of non-US financial institutions were largely responsible. In the next section, we review the money market turbulence in four currencies: US dollar, euro, pound sterling and Japanese yen. In the second section, we assess the effects on short-term FX swap markets in terms of deviations from no-arbitrage conditions between cash and swap-implied interest rates, as well as measures of changing liquidity. The third section discusses the related developments in cross-currency <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> markets, which are more commonly used than FX swap markets at longer maturities.

40|$|Using {{data from}} the Treasury versus London Interbank Offer Swap Rates (LIBOR) for October 1987 to June 1998, this paper {{examines}} the determinants of swap spreads in the Treasury-LIBOR interest rate swap market. This study hypothesizes Treasury-LIBOR swap spreads {{as a function of}} the Treasury rate of comparable maturity, the slope of the yield curve, the volatility of short-term interest rates, a proxy for default risk, and liquidity in the swap market. The study finds that, in the long-run, swap spreads are negatively related to the yield curve slope and liquidity in the swap market. We also find that swap spreads are positively related to the short-term interest rate volatility. In the short-run, swap market's response to higher default risk seems to be higher spread between the bid and offer rates.

To this end, we propose a three yield-curve model, one for discounting cash flows, one for calculating LIBOR deposit rates {{and one for}} calculating coupon rates of government bonds. The derivation of the yield curves from observed data is presented, and the option prices on a swap or a government bond are studied.

30|$|Figure  6 {{depicts the}} sample {{path of the}} VA process using the first interpolating {{function}} (left panels) for the five different CSA specifications (top to bottom), while the other figures show {{the differences in the}} VA due to the different interpolating functions. The differences in the VA are one order of magnitude smaller than the differences in prices, however, the VA itself is an order of magnitude smaller than the <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> price. Reflecting the situation for the prices, the largest discrepancies between VAs using the first and the other two interpolating functions occur around the curved section of the manifold. However, the discrepancies in the VA in the flat sections of the manifold are more pronounced than the corresponding discrepancies in prices. The reason is that the interpolation affects value adjustments both via the <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> price and via the short rate used for discounting, and its effect is propagated in different segments through the backward regression. This becomes clear when one looks at the differences between prices and value adjustments stemming from using the second and third interpolating functions; although the difference in prices is flat zero, the difference in value adjustments is far from zero.|$|E
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2007 - 2009 nancial crisis, a variety of spreads have developed between quantities that had been essentially the same until then, notably LIBOR-OIS spreads, LIBOR-OIS swap spreads, and <b>basis</b> <b>swap</b> spreads. By the end of 2011, with the sovereign credit crisis, these spreads were again signi cant. In this paper we study the valuation of LIBOR interest rate derivatives in a multiple-curve setup, which accounts for the spreads between a risk-free discount curve and LIBOR curves. Towards this end we resort to a defaultable HJM methodology, in which these spreads are explained by an implied default intensity of the LIBOR contributing banks, possibly in conjunction with an additional liquidity factor. Markovian short rate speci cations are given {{in the form of an}} extended CIR and a Lévy Hull White model for a risk-free short rate and a LIBOR short spread. The use of Lévy drivers leads to the more parsimonious speci cation.

In other words, if there is a significant move in FX, for example, all the PRDC books will need the same kind of FX volatility rebalancing at the same time. The note holders would be the natural counterparty for the hedge, but they don't take part in this market (similar to buyers of portfolio insurance in 1987).

40|$|Abstract. The large basis spreads {{observed}} on {{the interest rate}} mar-ket since the liquidity crisis of summer 2007 imply that different yield curves are required for market coherent estimation of forward rates with different tenors (e. g.

30|$|We {{consider}} {{the class of}} affine LIBOR models with multiple curves, which is an analytically tractable class of discrete tenor models that easily accommodates positive or negative interest rates and positive spreads. By introducing an interpolating function, we extend the affine LIBOR models to a continuous tenor and derive expressions for the instantaneous forward rate and the short rate. We show that the continuous tenor model is arbitrage-free, that the analytical tractability is retained under the spot martingale measure, and that under mild conditions an interpolating function can be found such that the extended model fits any initial forward curve. This allows us to compute value adjustments (i.e. XVAs) consistently, by solving the corresponding ‘pre-default’ BSDE. As an application, we compute the price and value adjustments for a <b>basis</b> <b>swap,</b> and study the model risk associated to different interpolating functions.|$|E
