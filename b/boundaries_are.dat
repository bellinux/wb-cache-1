5|$|Although {{contemporary}} {{sources are}} {{silent on the}} matter, {{it is more than}} likely that on Somairle's demise, his territory was divided amongst his surviving sons. The precise allotment of lands is unknown; even though the division of lands amongst later generations of meic Somairle can be readily discerned, such <b>boundaries</b> <b>are</b> unlikely to have existed during the chaotic twelfth century. It is possible that the territory of the first generation of meic Somairle may have stretched from Glenelg in the north, to the Mull of Kintyre in the south; with Áengus ruling in the north, Dubgall centred in Lorne (with possibly the bulk of the inheritance), and Ragnall in Kintyre and the southern islands.|$|E
30|$|The charts {{generated}} {{were examined}} {{to see which}} <b>boundary</b> <b>was</b> crossed. If the upper <b>boundary</b> <b>was</b> crossed, it implied that knees with anterolateral incision were preferred by the patients. If the lower <b>boundary</b> <b>was</b> crossed, it implied that knees with midline incision were preferred. If none of the two <b>boundaries</b> <b>were</b> crossed, it implied that patients did not prefer any one knee over the other. This method allowed us to conclude the trial {{as soon as the}} <b>boundary</b> <b>was</b> crossed. The upper <b>boundary</b> <b>was</b> crossed after charting the preferences of 19 patients; however, at that point the last patient was already recruited and so was allowed to complete the trial.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of Cold War tensions, the search and rescue {{operations}} of the Soviet Union were not coordinated {{with those of the}} United States, South Korea, and Japan. Consequently no information was shared, and each side endeavored to harass or obtain evidence to implicate the other. The flight data recorders were the key pieces of evidence sought by both governments, with the United States insisting that an independent observer from the ICAO be present on one of its search vessels in the event that they were found. International <b>boundaries</b> <b>are</b> not well defined on the open sea, leading to numerous confrontations between the large number of opposing naval ships that were assembled in the area.|$|E

Counties Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Tipperary have been broken up into smaller administrative areas. However, they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes, for example postal addresses and by the Ordnance Survey Ireland. Counties in Northern Ireland are no longer used for local governmental purposes, but, as in the Republic, their traditional <b>boundaries</b> <b>are</b> still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 7th century, the West Saxons {{occupied}} {{an area in}} the west of southern England, though the exact <b>boundaries</b> <b>are</b> difficult to define. To their west was the native British kingdom of Dumnonia, {{in what is now}} Devon and Cornwall. To the north were the Mercians, whose king, Wulfhere, had dominated southern England during his reign. In 674 he was succeeded by his brother, Æthelred, who was less militarily active than Wulfhere had been along the frontier with Wessex, though the West Saxons did not recover the territorial gains Wulfhere had made. To the southeast was the kingdom of the South Saxons, in what is now Sussex; and to the east were the East Saxons, who controlled London.|$|E
5|$|Khmer Loeu {{typically}} practice subsistence slash {{and burn}} shifting cultivation in small villages of between 20 and 60 nuclear families. Each village collectively owns and governs a forest territory whose <b>boundaries</b> <b>are</b> known though not marked. Within this land, each family is allocated, on average, 1–2hectares (2.5–5acres) of actively cultivated land and 5–6hectares (12.5–15acres) of fallow land. The ecologically sustainable cultivation cycle {{practiced by the}} Khmer Loeu generally lasts 10 to 15 years. Villagers supplement their agricultural livelihood with low-intensity hunting, fishing, and gathering over a large area.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{are highly}} {{territorial}} and aggressive ants which establish firm borders between neighbouring colonies. While the <b>boundaries</b> <b>are</b> not physical, worker ants maintain them {{by engaging in}} ritualised fighting with opponent ants, an interaction most colonies engage in. Fatalities are rare on both sides, but fights may cause injuries to several workers. This fighting enables territory to be contested between opposing colonies without them killing each other and costing many casualties on both sides. Due of this, it is a method of avoiding casualties and promotes intercolony communication and assessment. A drainage {{of the work force}} would occur if these boundaries acted as a conflict zone if ritualised fighting did not take place. Lethal fighting only occurs if the colony is under attack.|$|E

5|$|Old Louisville's <b>boundaries</b> <b>are</b> Kentucky Street to the north, Avery Street (Cardinal Boulevard) to the south, I-65 to the east, the CSX {{railroad}} tracks to the west. Originally, the neighborhood extended {{all the way}} to Broadway on the north, Attwood Street on the south, and Floyd Street on the East; but the northern part was mostly razed for parking lots and light industry, the southern area between Attwood and Avery Streets (now Cardinal Blvd) was razed when the University of Louisville doubled the size of its main campus, and I-65 was built through the area in the 1960s, which created a physical barrier between it and Shelby Park neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Paper Mario {{combines}} traditional role-playing game (RPG) elements with {{concepts and}} features from the Mario series. For {{the majority of}} the game, the player controls Mario, who can jump and use his hammer to overcome physical obstacles placed in the game's overworld. Many of the game's puzzles and <b>boundaries</b> <b>are</b> based upon the abilities of Mario's partners, who each have a specialised skill required for progression in the game. The player accumulates partners as they advance into different locations; only one partner can accompany Mario in the overworld, although the player can interchange them at any time.|$|E
