40|$|Research PaperTasmania's abalone, rock {{lobster and}} scalefish {{fisheries}} have an annual <b>beach</b> <b>price</b> value of about A$ 120, A$ 64 and A$ 10 million respectively. Whilst small by overseas standards, Tasmania's fishing industry {{is an important}} part of this small island State's predominantly rural income, amounting to some 16 % of total agricultural production. It is therefore natural that the legislative objectives for Tasmanian fisheries extend beyond those associated with resource sustainability, to encompass social and economic outcomes including benefit for Tasmanian fishers, Tasmanian coastal communities and Tasmania's population as a whole. The abalone, rock lobster and scalefish fisheries have a distinctly different history and significantly different management regimes. Whilst all management arrangements were designed to achieve sustainability of the resource and the ecosystem from which it is harvested, each also has had different social outcomes and economic outcomes. The introduction of quota management regimes in the abalone and rock lobster fisheries has achieved the principal management objectives. The primary objective of making the scalefish fishery sustainable using input controls has yet to be achieved, although current changes should more closely match the amount of allocated effort in the fishery with an ecologically sustainable catch...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{individual}} transferable quota (ITQ) management {{requires a}} binding (constraining) total allowable catch (TAC). A non-binding TAC {{may result in a}} shift back towards open access conditions, where fishers increasingly compete (‘race’) to catch their share of the total harvest. This process was examined by comparing fishing fleet behaviour and profitability in the Tasmanian southern rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) fishery (TSRLF), Australia. Between 2008 and 2010, the TSRLF had a non-binding TAC and effectively reverted to a regulated, limited-entry fishery. Fishers' uncertainty about future profitability and their ability to take their allocated catch weakened the security characteristic of the ITQ allocation. The low quota lease price contributed to an increase in fleet capacity, while the more limited reduction in quota asset value proved an investment barrier, hindering the autonomous adjustment of quota towards the most efficient fishers. In the TSRLF, catch rates vary more than <b>beach</b> <b>price</b> and are therefore more important for determining daily revenue (i. e., price x catch rate) than market price. Consequently, fishers concentrated effort during times of higher catch rates rather than high market demand. This increased rent dissipation as fishers engaged in competitive race to fish {{to be the first to}} exploit the stock and obtain higher catch rates. The history of this fishery emphasizes the need for a constraining TAC in all ITQ fisheries, not only for stock management, but also to manage the security of the ITQ allocation and prevent unanticipated and undesirable changes in fisher behaviour and fishery profitability...|$|E

40|$|Is the European gas market integrated? Are there {{substantial}} {{price differences}} between gas from different export countries? Time series of Norwegian, Dutch and Russian gas export prices to Germany in 1990 - 1998 are examined. Cointegration tests show that {{that the different}} <b>beach</b> <b>prices</b> for gas to Germany move proportionally over time, indicating an integrated gas market (the Law of One Price holds). We find differences in mean prices, with Russian gas being sold at prices systematically lower than Dutch and Norwegian gas. Surveying {{the features of the}} long term take-or-pay contracts for gas sales, we discuss possible explanations for the price discrepancy. Among the explanatory factors are differences in volume flexibility (swing) and perceived political risk. This paper examines the degree of market integration of the European natural gas market, with a focus on German import from the Netherlands, Norway and Russia. Theory predicts that in an integrated market, prices from different suppliers should move in the same direction, and price differentials should only be present if there are differences in transportation costs or quality. However, the explanation behind price discrepancies may be somewhat more complicated in the European natural gas market. Natural gas is overwhelmingly sold on complex long-term contracts that have a number of features that may influence the contract price, and hence lead to price variations across contracts. Furthermore, there may be elements of political risk that can influence relative prices. We investigate the degree of market integration in the German market by examining the relationship between the import prices from the three main suppliers, the Netherlands, Norway and Russia. Since the prices appear to be nonstationary, cointegration analysis will be the empirical tool. We will also examine the underlying determinants of our empirical results, particularly on the impact of the contract structure. An analysis of the long term take-or-pay gas export contracts is given, and the export strategies of the Netherlands, Norway and Russia are examined in relation to our empirical findings. Germany is a natural candidate for a case study since this is the largest national gas market on the Continent, has a central position with respect to the distribution of gas across the European market, {{and is one of the}} few markets where three of the largest producers all supply considerable quantities. Germany is also an interesting case in light of the EU Gas Directive, since the liberalisation of the German natural gas market will have a major influence on the development in the rest of Europe...|$|R
