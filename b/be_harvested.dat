5|$|In {{line with}} the aim {{to make use of}} {{renewable}} resources, the furniture in Poh Ern Shih for its resident monastics is made from bamboo. Bamboo is considered {{to one of the most}} ecologically friendly materials for use in home furnishing and flooring, because it can <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> without felling the entire tree. There is therefore no need for replanting, and the bamboo is allowed to regain its full height again over about five years, ready to <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> again.|$|E
5|$|I'itoi {{onion is}} a {{prolific}} multiplier onion cultivated in the Baboquivari Peak Wilderness, Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and {{is easy to}} grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1in below the surface and 12in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> throughout the cooler months. Tops die back {{in the heat of}} summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> and stored in a cool dry place for planting in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.|$|E
5|$|Relatively {{minor damage}} {{occurred}} in North Korea, previously impacted by Typhoon Prapiroon earlier in September. Rainfall peaked at 147mm (5.79in) in Kaesong. Saomai somewhat exacerbated the unprecedented {{damage caused by}} Prapiroon, and damaged maize crops which were set to <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> in the coming weeks.|$|E
50|$|Various animals <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> {{for display}} and as pet; {{many species of}} plants <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> for {{personal}} and private gardening.|$|R
50|$|In September, millet <b>is</b> <b>harvested,</b> {{followed}} closely by beans. In late October or November sorghum <b>is</b> <b>harvested.</b> In addition to this, farmers who do not wish for their cereal stalks to be consumed by livestock must also harvest these. Some farmers begin planting guna melon as the millet <b>is</b> <b>harvested.</b> However, guna melon is very vulnerable to pests, so the crop is not successful in every year. They <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> from February to April if it is.|$|R
30|$|The fruits <b>were</b> <b>harvested</b> during June 2011 and 2012 {{following}} 18 and 30  months of plantation. All {{the fruits}} from each plot <b>were</b> <b>harvested,</b> counted and weighed.|$|R
5|$|All {{motorized}} {{vehicles are}} prohibited, {{but it is}} permitted to bring canoes and other non-motorized boats, as well as skiing during winter. Walking and tenting is permitted everywhere. Berries and mushrooms can <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> for personal use. Hunting and fishing is also permitted with a hunting or fishing license. Dogs may be brought along, but must be in a leash between 1 April and 20 August. Hikers must show special consideration regarding vegetation, animal life and cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{has named}} {{the rim of}} Shackleton as a {{potential}} candidate for its lunar outpost, slated to {{be up and running}} by 2020 and continuously staffed by a crew by 2024. The location would promote self-sustainability for lunar residents, as perpetual sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels. Furthermore, the shadowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human consumption and could also <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> for fuel manufacture.|$|E
5|$|The ice trade {{started with}} the {{harvesting}} of ice from ponds and rivers during the winter, to be stored for the summer months ahead. Water freezes in this way once it falls to a temperature of 40°F (5°C)and the surrounding air temperature drops to 32°F (0°C). Ice needed {{to be at least}} 18inches (0.46 m) thick to <b>be</b> <b>harvested,</b> as it needed to support the weight of the workers and horses and be suitable for cutting into large blocks. In New England, ponds and rivers typically had deep enough ice to harvest between January and March, while in Norway harvesting occurred between December and February. Natural ice could occur with different qualities; most prized was hard, clear crystal ice, typically consumed at the table; more porous, white coloured ice was less valuable and used by industry. With a good thickness of ice, around 1,000 tons (900,000kg) could <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> from an acre (0.4 hectares) of surface water.|$|E
5000|$|Bancha (番茶) is a Japanese green tea. It <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> {{from the}} second flush of sencha between summer and autumn. (The first flush <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> for shincha.) ...|$|R
50|$|P. pollicipes <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> for {{consumption}} {{in many parts}} of its range, mostly for the Spanish market, where it may sell for as much as €90 per kilogram. As a result, the species is thought to be in decline. It <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> manually, and archaeological evidence suggests that the species has <b>been</b> <b>harvested</b> in this way for over 10,000 years.|$|R
50|$|The chikutoh {{sugarcane}} <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> between December and February. It <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> late in {{the year}} on purpose, to allow the sugar content of the cane to develop to its maximum.|$|R
5|$|A lake {{restoration}} plan {{based on a}} decentralised bioreactor system to eliminate the organic load that enters the lake {{in the form of}} non-point and point source pollutants has also been mooted. Phumdis could <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> in a sustainable manner by conversion into fuel and compost by installing ‘Plug Flow Bioreactors’ in a modular manner around the lake perimeter. Laboratory tests of key species of phumdis have proved its potential to produce biogas. The bioreactors could also be used to treat sewage and thus arrest flow of organic matter into the lake.|$|E
5|$|Edible {{mushrooms}} are well-known examples of fungi. Many are commercially raised, but others must <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> from the wild. Agaricus bisporus, sold as button mushrooms when small or Portobello mushrooms when larger, is a commonly eaten species, used in salads, soups, {{and many other}} dishes. Many Asian fungi are commercially grown and have increased in popularity in the West. They are often available fresh in grocery stores and markets, including straw mushrooms (Volvariella volvacea), oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus), shiitakes (Lentinula edodes), and enokitake (Flammulina spp.).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to game, mutton was consumed {{from time to}} time. Keeping sheep provided wool to the household, and when a sheep reached an age when it was unsuitable for wool production, it could <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> as mutton. Sheep were originally introduced to the Americas through the Spanish in Florida. In the north, the Dutch and English also introduced several varieties of sheep. The casual English practice of animal husbandry allowed sheep to roam free, consuming a variety of forage. Foragebased diets produce meat with a characteristically strong, gamey flavor and a tough consistency, which requires aging and slow cooking to tenderize.|$|E
30|$|Plants from maize {{treatments}} <b>were</b> <b>harvested</b> 52 DAE (end of vegetative stage) for {{measurements of}} plant components. Plants from wheat treatments <b>were</b> <b>harvested</b> 54 DAE (end of vegetative stage) for measurements of plant components.|$|R
50|$|Wild grapes <b>were</b> <b>harvested</b> by foragers {{and early}} farmers. For {{thousands}} of years, the fruit has <b>been</b> <b>harvested</b> for both medicinal and nutritional value; its history is intimately entwined {{with the history}} of wine.|$|R
50|$|Fruit <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> locally for {{pies and}} jams. The saskatoon berry <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> commercially. One {{version of the}} Native American food pemmican was flavored by {{serviceberry}} fruits in combination with minced dried meat and fat.|$|R
5|$|In {{areas with}} {{wet and dry}} seasons, soil {{nutrients}} diminish and erosion increases during the wet season. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season. Rain may <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> {{through the use of}} rainwater tanks; treated to potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation. Excessive rain during short periods of time can cause flash floods.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} natural ice {{to reach its}} customers, it had to <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> from ponds and rivers, then transported and stored at various sites before finally being used in {{domestic}} or commercial applications. Throughout these processes, traders faced the problem of keeping the ice from melting; melted ice represented waste and lost profits. In the 1820s and 1830s only 10 percent of ice harvested was eventually sold to the end user due to wastage en route. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, however, the wastage in the ice trade was reduced to between 20 and 50 percent, depending on the efficiency of the company.|$|E
5|$|Routine care {{during the}} growing season {{involves}} keeping the rows free of competing weeds, especially when the plants are young. The plants are shallow-rooted and do not need a great deal of water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be kept in storage, they should <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left {{on the surface of the}} soil for a few days to dry out properly, then they can be placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes. They should be stored in a well-ventilated, cool place such as a shed.|$|E
5000|$|J. kraussii <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> and weaved {{to produce}} {{traditional}} sleeping mats, baskets, beer strainers, and other craftwork items in many Zulu areas of South Africa. The plant is in great demand {{because of its}} economic value and has <b>been</b> extensively <b>harvested</b> in the wild. It is now cultivated in many areas and <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> yearly {{for a period of}} seven years in total.|$|R
50|$|Gaoshan {{tea leaves}} <b>are</b> usually hand <b>harvested,</b> and grow slowly {{due to the}} thin air in high altitudes. Hence, the yield of gaoshan tea is {{relatively}} low every year. There {{are two kinds of}} gaoshan tea based on the season: winter gaoshan <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> during late October, and spring gaoshan <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> during the middle of June.|$|R
40|$|Cabbage <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> when heads become {{firm and}} mature. Delay in harvest for several days, {{past the point}} of {{technological}} maturity, may lead to head cracking and occurrence of diseases. Only well-formed and tightly packed heads <b>are</b> <b>harvested.</b> Cabbage <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> once or two times, at the stage of full technological maturity. Cabbage heads can be picked by hand, or the <b>harvest</b> <b>is</b> semi-mechanized or fully mechanized. Plants with incompletely packed head {{at the time of the}} last harvest significantly reduce yield performance. A breeding objective is to obtain plants that manage to pack their heads in shortest possible time, which enables mechanized <b>harvest.</b> Careful <b>harvest</b> <b>is</b> the main prerequisite for a good and long storage of cabbage heads. ...|$|R
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{pinniped}} continue to <b>be</b> <b>harvested.</b> The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals allows limited hunting of crabeater seals, leopard seals and Weddell seals. However, Weddell seal hunting is prohibited between September and February if {{the animal is}} over one year of age, to ensure breeding stocks are healthy. Other species protected are southern elephant seals, Ross seals and Antarctic fur seals. The Government of Canada permits the hunting of harp seals. This has been met with controversy and debate. Proponents of seal hunts insist that the animals are killed humanely and the white-coated pups are not taken, while opponents {{argue that it is}} irresponsible to kill harp seals as they are already threatened by declining habitat.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} {{photosynthesis}} in very basic forms of plant life worldwide allowed the sun's energy to <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> to create conditions allowing for more complex life. The resultant oxygen accumulated {{in the atmosphere}} and {{gave rise to the}} ozone layer. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes. Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms. With the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.|$|E
5|$|The fruitbodies (ascocarps) of Geopyxis carbonaris are cup shaped, 1–2cm wide, {{and have}} fringed whitish margins. The inner spore-bearing {{surface of the}} cup, the hymenium, is brick red and smooth, while the {{exterior}} surface is a dull yellow, and may be either smooth or have blister-like spots (pustules). The stipe is small (1–1.5mm long and 1–2mm wide), whitish in color, and expands abruptly into the cup. The brownish flesh of the fungus is thin and brittle. It {{does not have any}} distinctive taste, but has an unpleasant smell when crushed in water. The edibility of the fungus is not known, but the fruitbodies are insubstantial and unlikely to <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> for eating.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} Korean rural folk traditions, {{the sport is}} {{regarded}} as a predictor of future events, specifically harvests. The outcome of a ritualised contest between the two sides of a village (East and West) was seen as an indicator of the abundance (or otherwise) of that year's rice crop, which would <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> in the autumn; as a result, juldarigi and similar folk sports are predominant in the rice-growing areas of the South. This is due to the common association in Southeast Asia between dragons (which the ropes of the juldarigi are thought to resemble) and rain; as a result juldarigi or similar tug-of-war ceremonies have also historically been staged during periods of drought. The connection of the two ropes used (with one rope's smaller loop being placed through the other's larger loop) is reminiscent of sexual intercourse, which also gives rise to the sport's association with fecundity.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{reactions}} led to {{the first}} self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all life arose. The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted {{in the development of}} complex cells called eukaryotes. True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface. Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia, biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland, remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the sharptooth houndshark adapts well to captivity and {{has been}} {{displayed}} in public aquariums. It is frequently caught by recreational anglers from shore or ski-boats; it is edible but rarely eaten. Small numbers are also caught incidentally by a commercial demersal longline fishery targeting the school shark (Galeorhinus galeus) in the Gansbaai and False Bay region. The meat from sharks caught in the fishery is either made into biltong or jerky and sold locally, or exported fresh or frozen to Italy and Taiwan. Although in South Africa the sharptooth houndshark is listed as a noncommercial species and thus cannot <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> commercially, it is often mistaken for the common smooth-hound (Mustelus mustelus) by fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the sharptooth houndshark as Near Threatened. This species is highly susceptible to even moderate levels of fishing pressure, due to its restricted range, slow growth rate, and low fecundity. The fact that most sharks caught by fishers are immature is an additional source of concern.|$|E
30|$|Cultured BMDMs or THP- 1 {{cells were}} treated with 5 ng/mL LPS and MDP (1 μg/ mL and 10 μg/mL) for 4 h before cells <b>were</b> <b>harvested</b> for total RNA {{extraction}}. BMDMs or THP- 1 cells {{were treated with}} 5 ng/mL LPS and MDP (1 μg/mL and 10 μg/mL) for 12 h before supernatants <b>were</b> <b>harvested.</b> For ER stress-induced inflammation, cultured BMDMs were stimulated with thapsigargin (1 μmol/L and 10 μmol/L) for 24 h before cells <b>were</b> <b>harvested</b> for RNA extraction and supernatants were collected for ELISA assay.|$|R
50|$|To have {{a source}} of fiber to utilize in productuion, the fiber first must be {{extracted}} from the plant. This is done in different ways depending on the fiber classification. Bast fibers <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> through retting which is where microbes are utilized to remove soft tissues from the plant and only the useful fibrous material remains. Hard fibers <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> mainly through decortication {{which is where the}} non-fibrous tissues are removed by hand or machine. Lastly, surface fibers <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> through ginning which is where a machine removes the fibers from other plant material.|$|R
