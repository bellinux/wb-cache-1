5|$|Ranson {{suspected}} a suicide, but {{a thorough}} search of Newhaven Downs was judged impossible. A partial search was made, using tracker dogs, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> was found were the skeletal {{remains of a}} judge who had disappeared years earlier. Police divers searched the harbour, and a partial search using infra-red photography was undertaken the following year, to no avail. A warrant for Lucan's arrest, to answer charges of murdering Sandra Rivett, and attempting to murder his wife, was issued on Tuesday 12November 1974. Descriptions of his appearance, already issued to police forces across the UK, were then issued to Interpol.|$|E

25|$|Thus it {{was that}} Wamba the husbandman first became king and {{afterwards}} monk. In all his stations—farmer, king, and monk—he acquitted himself well and worthily, and his name has come down {{to us from the}} mists of time as one of those rare men of whom we know little, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> little good.|$|E

25|$|There is {{an image}} of a small {{hexagonal}} temple, surmounted by a miniature portico, and nearby a statue of St Bonaventure. The ruins of this folly - though not the statue - still exist, on a small rise in clear view of someone leaving the chateau, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> remains now is the exposed brick frame, showing the arched opes but without an upper structure.|$|E
25|$|Some learned {{men have}} thought they {{discovered}} some vestiges of vampirism in the remotest antiquity; <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> they say of {{it does not}} come near what is related of the vampires. The lamiæ, the strigæ, the sorcerers whom they accused of sucking the blood of living persons, and of thus causing their death, the magicians who were said to cause the death of new-born children by charms and malignant spells, are nothing less than what we understand {{by the name of}} vampires; even were it to be owned that these lamiæ and strigæ have really existed, which we do not believe can ever be well proved.|$|E
25|$|Allestree was {{formally}} a distinct rural settlement centred around St Edmund's Church, the old village centre was designated a Conservation Area by the City Council in September 1991. The designated area starts on Cornhill encompassing {{part of the}} golf course on Allestree Park. All houses on St Edmund Close, Siddals Lane, The Poplars and the area {{to the north of}} Church Walk are included, as well as St Edmund's Church and the adjacent Red Cow inn. The area surrounding the old village centre contains seven listed buildings, the church being the oldest, dating back to the 12th century. The church dates from the 12th century, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> remains of the original building is the ornately carved Romanesque doorway.|$|E

25|$|San Francisco {{started the}} second half with a drive into Washington territory, aided by a {{controversial}} ruling in which running back Wendell Tyler dropped the ball just a second after catching it and then dove on it. Officials ruled the play a fumble and recovery for the 49ers rather than an incompletion. But kicker Ray Wersching later slipped on the muddy field while attempting a 50-yard field goal and it fell well short. On Washington's next drive, they ran another trick play, this time a pass from Riggins, who threw a 36-yard completion to Charlie Brown inside the 49ers 15-yard line. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> led to was Moseley's third missed field goal attempt of the day, this one from 38 yards, that he once again sent wide right.|$|E
500|$|At a {{performance}} in 1957 conducted by Tony Aubin, the musicographer René Dumesnil commented: [...] "the economy of means does not embarrass Delage {{more than the}} scale, and whatever the number of performers, {{it has the same}} sureness. [...] Nothing unnecessary, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> can best translate thought, feeling, or subtle impression to create {{in the mind of the}} listener the echo of an idea that music alone is capable of awakening—when written by a magician like him." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1972 Larkin {{wrote the}} oft-quoted [...] "Going, Going", a poem which expresses a romantic fatalism in {{its view of}} England that was typical of his later years. In it he prophesies a {{complete}} destruction of the countryside, and expresses an idealised sense of national togetherness and identity: [...] "And that will be England gone... it will linger on in galleries; <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> remains for us will be concrete and tyres". The poem ends with the blunt statement, [...] "I just think it will happen, soon." ...|$|E

The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "The Other Woman definitely boasts a talented pedigree, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> skill is never fully {{brought to bear on}} a story that settles for cheap laughs instead of reaching its empowering potential." [...] On Metacritic, {{the film has}} a score of 39 out of 100 based on reviews from 35 critics, indicating [...] "generally unfavorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of [...] "B+" [...] on an A+ to F scale.|$|E
500|$|Rick Ross drops by to say hi, {{keeping his}} {{appearance}} so brief that I can't {{help but wonder}} what he's even doing here. Justin Vernon inexplicably bookends the thing, pushing his falsetto into Antony range on the outro and muttering befuddling lyrics {{that have nothing to}} do with the rest of the song. All this over the straight-up funkiest beat Kanye West has made in years, a rippling electro push-pull that adds an effortless strut to his recent progged-out chilliness. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> other stuff fades into the background when Nicki Minaj shows up. [...] She's a whirlwind of energy, showing her full repertoire of nutso voices and kicking the living fuck out of the beat, sounding like she's having an absolute blast the whole time." ...|$|E
500|$|However, the {{response}} was not exclusively positive. In The Independent on Sunday, columnist Lucy Ellmann criticised both what she saw as the unchanging nature of the characters and Flannery's concentration on friendship rather than family. [...] "What's in the water there anyway? These are the youngest grandparents ever seen! Nothing has changed about them since 1964 except a few grey hairs... It's quite impressive that anything emotional could be salvaged from this nine-part hop, skip and jump through the years. In fact we still hardly know these people – zooming from one decade to the next has a distancing effect," [...] she wrote of the former point. And of the latter, [...] "Peter Flannery {{seems to want to}} suggest that friendships are the only cure for a life blighted by deficient parents. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> links this ill-matched foursome in the end is history and sentimentality. The emotional centre of the writing is still in family ties." ...|$|E

2500|$|The exact date of {{the battle}} is uncertain, other than it {{happened}} before the Battle of Aldy Charrish, which documentary evidence dates to either July 1487 or June 1486.

2500|$|In {{the same}} month, French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, while {{discussing}} penalties that Europe might impose on Iran, {{said that they}} could be [...] "economic sanctions regarding financial movements... Our German friends proposed this. We discussed it a few days ago. The international community's demand is simple: They must stop enriching uranium. Our Iranian friends want to create, they say, civilian nuclear energy. They have the right to that, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> they are doing proves the contrary.

2500|$|In his 1915 article Calvin's Doctrine of Creation, Warfield wrote [...] "It should {{scarcely}} {{be passed}} without remark that Calvin's doctrine of creation is, {{if we have}} understood it aright, for all except the souls of men, an evolutionary one. The 'indigested mass,' including the 'promise and potency' of all that was yet to be, was called into being by the simple fiat of God. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> has come into being since- except the souls of men alone - has arisen as a modification of this original world-stuff {{by means of the}} interaction of its intrinsic forces. Not these forces apart from God, of course..." ...|$|E

Loads of characters are revived and brought back but I don't know if it's something I'd want to do again at the moment. It still feels like only yesterday I was there and it's good to kind of recharge your batteries and {{get out there and}} do other things. But I love the show and I’d never say never!

2500|$|Symons {{was taken}} to the 20th Field Hospital at Dundee in excruciating pain from a severe wound in his stomach <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> he wanted to know was [...] "have they got the hill?" [...] While the battle was won their {{position}} at Dundee quickly became untenable. After a few wasted days Symons' replacement, Brigadier General Yule, decided to abandon the town and the worst-wounded to the Boers and steal away at night to Ladysmith. The next day the town surrendered and Symons became a prisoner of war along with many others. He clearly felt betrayed by Yule and just before he died on 23 October he implored the medical officer, Major Donegan, to [...] "tell everyone I died facing the enemy, tell everyone I died facing the enemy".|$|E
2500|$|Sweden enters proto-history {{with the}} Germania of Tacitus in 98 AD. In [...] he {{mentions}} the Swedes (Suiones) {{as a powerful}} tribe (distinguished not merely for their arms and men, but for their powerful fleets) with ships that had a prow in both ends (longships). Which kings (kuningaz) ruled these Suiones is unknown, but Norse mythology presents {{a long line of}} legendary and semi-legendary kings going back to the last centuries BC. As for literacy in Sweden itself, the runic script was in use among the south Scandinavian elite by at least the 2nd century AD, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> has survived from the Roman Period is curt inscriptions on artefacts, mainly of male names, demonstrating that the people of south Scandinavia spoke Proto-Norse at the time, a language ancestral to Swedish and other North Germanic languages.|$|E
