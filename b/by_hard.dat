5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, pop-rock largely {{consisted}} of the radio-friendly glam metal bands, who used images derived from the British glam movement with macho lyrics and attitudes, accompanied <b>by</b> <b>hard</b> rock music and heavy metal virtuosic soloing. Bands from this era included many British groups like Def Leppard, as well as heavy metal-influenced American bands Mötley Crüe, Guns N' Roses, Bon Jovi and Van Halen.|$|E
5|$|The Blackdown Hills form a flat plateau {{dominated}} <b>by</b> <b>hard</b> chert bands, {{made up of}} clay with flints, of Upper Greensand {{with some}} remnants of chalk. The cretaceous rocks rest over eroded Jurassic and Triassic beds, with an outcrop of Rhaetian beds. In the western areas the Upper Greensand is devoid of calcareous material but the sands yield fossils of marine bivalves and gastropods (snails) preserved in silica.|$|E

5|$|This {{island is}} {{unlikely}} to disappear entirely in the near future. The eroded area consisted mostly of loose tephra, easily washed away. Most of the remaining area is capped <b>by</b> <b>hard</b> lava flows, which are much more resistant to erosion. In addition, complex chemical reactions within the loose tephra within the island have gradually formed highly erosion resistant tuff material, in {{a process known as}} palagonitization. On Surtsey this process has happened quite rapidly, due to high temperatures not far below the surface.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of The Jazz Singer, all the major film {{companies}} were racing to hire audio engineers so they could record and reproduce sound for film. Through common acquaintances at Electrical Research Products, Inc. (ERPI) within Western Electric, Hilliard was contacted and hired by United Artists Studios (UA) in Hollywood, California in 1928 because of his studies in physics, engineering and acoustics. Having left his Masters studies behind in Minnesota, Hilliard, not yet 28 years old, supervised all sound recording for Coquette, UA's first talking motion picture. Western Electric provided recording equipment, but the specific techniques for achieving best sound on film had to be developed <b>by</b> <b>hard</b> work and imagination. Hilliard's ground-breaking methods later became industry standards.|$|E
5|$|In early 2007, {{the band}} {{announced}} a new World Tour, their first {{for nearly a decade}} to include dates outside North America or Japan. The band performed at London's Hard Rock Cafe in February 2007 to promote their European tour which included a night in Hyde Park as part of the Hyde Park Calling festival sponsored <b>by</b> <b>Hard</b> Rock Cafe. In the spring, the band toured Latin America to sold-out stadium crowds. In the summer, the band toured Europe, performing at several major rock festivals and visiting some countries they had never played before. Additionally, the band played in Middle East countries such as the United Arab Emirates and India for the first time. The band also played a few select dates in California and Canada in late July. The July 21 concert in Prince Edward Island, was the largest in that province's history. In September, the band performed eight dates in major markets in Northeastern North America. These shows were opened by Joan Jett. The band also played a private gig in Hawaii. A public show in Maui was canceled for logistical reasons, which spurred a class action lawsuit against the band. In April 2009, Aerosmith agreed to compensate all ticket buyers of the canceled show with a free ticket to a rescheduled Maui show to be held on October 20, 2009, along with reimbursements of all out-of-pocket expenses related to the show.|$|E

5|$|The {{momentum}} {{behind the}} NWOBHM also benefited already established bands, which reclaimed the spotlight with new and acclaimed releases. Ex-Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan returned to sing heavy metal with the album Mr. Universe in 1979 {{and was on}} the forefront of the British metal scene with his band Gillan in the following years. His former Deep Purple bandmate Ritchie Blackmore also climbed the UK charts with his hard rock group Rainbow's releases Down to Earth (1979) and Difficult to Cure (1981). Black Sabbath recovered and returned to success with the albums Heaven and Hell (1980) and Mob Rules (1981), featuring the ex-Rainbow singer Ronnie James Dio. 1980 saw several other entries <b>by</b> <b>hard</b> rock and heavy metal bands in the top 10 of the British charts: MSG's first album peaked at No.8, Whitesnake's Ready an' Willing at No.6, Judas Priest's best-seller British Steel and Motörhead's Ace of Spades at No.4, while Back in Black by AC/DC reached number one.|$|E
5|$|Uttar Pradesh, with a {{total area}} of , is India’s fourth-largest state in terms of land area. It is {{situated}} on the northern spout of India and shares an international boundary with Nepal. The Himalayas border the state on the north, but the plains that cover {{most of the state}} are distinctly different from those high mountains. The larger Gangetic Plain region is in the north; it includes the Ganges-Yamuna Doab, the Ghaghra plains, the Ganges plains and the Terai. The smaller Vindhya Range and plateau region is in the south. It is characterised <b>by</b> <b>hard</b> rock strata and a varied topography of hills, plains, valleys and plateaus. The Bhabhar tract gives place to the terai area which is covered with tall elephant grass and thick forests interspersed with marshes and swamps. The sluggish rivers of the bhabhar deepen in this area, their course running through a tangled mass of thick undergrowth. The terai runs parallel to the bhabhar in a thin strip. The entire alluvial plain is divided into three sub-regions. The first in the eastern tract consisting of 14 districts which are subject to periodical floods and droughts and have been classified as scarcity areas. These districts have the highest density of population which gives the lowest per capita land. The other two regions, the central and the western are comparatively better with a well-developed irrigation system. They suffer from waterlogging and large-scale user tracts. In addition, the area is fairly arid. The state has more than 32 large and small rivers; of them, the Ganges, Yamuna, Saraswati, Sarayu, Betwa, and Ghaghara are larger and of religious importance in Hinduism.|$|E
