5|$|Although no star {{systems in}} Telescopium have {{confirmed}} planets, several {{have been found}} to have <b>brown</b> <b>dwarf</b> companions. A member of the 12-million-year-old Beta Pictoris moving group of stars that share a common proper motion through space, Eta Telescopii is a young white main sequence star of magnitude 5.0 and spectral type A0V. It has a debris disk and <b>brown</b> <b>dwarf</b> companion of spectral type M7V or M8V that is between 20 and 50 times as massive as Jupiter. The system is complex, as it has a common proper motion with (and is gravitationally bound to) the star HD 181327, which has its own debris disk. This latter star is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F6V of magnitude 7.0. PZ Telescopii is another young star with a debris disk and substellar <b>brown</b> <b>dwarf</b> companion, though at 24 million years of age appears too old {{to be part of the}} Beta Pictoris moving group. HD 191760 is a yellow subgiant—a star that is cooling and expanding off the main sequence—of spectral type G3IV/V. Estimated to be just over four billion years old, it is slightly (1.1 to 1.3 times) more massive as the Sun, 2.69 times as luminous, and has around 1.62 times its radius. Using the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) instrument on the ESO 3.6 m Telescope, it was found to have a <b>brown</b> <b>dwarf</b> around 38 times as massive as Jupiter orbiting at an average distance of 1.35 AU with a period of 505 days. This is an unusually close distance from the star, within a range that has been termed the brown-dwarf desert.|$|E
5|$|Binary {{systems of}} sub-brown dwarfs are {{theoretically}} possible; Oph 162225-240515 was initially {{thought to be}} a binary system of a <b>brown</b> <b>dwarf</b> of 14 Jupiter masses and a sub-brown dwarf of 7 Jupiter masses, but further observations revised the estimated masses upwards to greater than 13 Jupiter masses, making them brown dwarfs according to the IAU working definitions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>dwarfs</b> {{have greater}} {{internal}} heating than gas giants {{but not as}} great as stars. The internal heating within <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs</b> (initially generated by gravitational contraction) is great enough to ignite and sustain fusion of deuterium with hydrogen to helium; for the largest <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs,</b> it is also enough to ignite and sustain fusion of lithium with hydrogen, but not fusion of hydrogen with itself.

Two further star systems have been found to have planets. The constellation also contains two Cepheid variables visible to the naked eye. Theta Muscae is a triple star system, the brightest member of which is a Wolf–Rayet star.|$|E
5|$|Several {{stars in}} Serpens {{have been found}} to have planets. The brightest, Omega Serpentis, located between Epsilon and Mu, is an orange giant with a planet of at least 1.7 Jupiter-masses. NN Serpentis, an eclipsing post-common-envelope binary {{consisting}} of a white dwarf and a red dwarf, is very likely to have two planets causing variations in the period of the eclipses.

Telescopium hosts two unusual stars with very little hydrogen {{that are likely to}} be the result of two merged white dwarfs: PV Telescopii, also known as HD 168476, is a hot blue extreme helium star, while RS Telescopii is an R Coronae Borealis variable. RR Telescopii is a cataclysmic variable that brightened as a nova to magnitude 6 in 1948.|$|E

I describe the physical traits attributed to stars, <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs,</b> and planets; compare the mass functions of <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs</b> and planets; and discuss how studies of <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs</b> in both young clusters and in the field can be used to challenge and constrain star and planet formation theories...|$|R

5|$|Follow-up imaging {{took place}} on July 2, 2009 and August 30, 2010 using the same instruments, as astronomers hoped to reveal this {{companion}} object's proper motion, or the rate that it moves over time.

The observations over the three years was compiled, with the data used to filter out pixelated portions of the images and improve the images' quality. The result suggested not only that the faint object in the image was nearby the star HIP 78530, but that it was a <b>brown</b> <b>dwarf</b> or planet in size. Further study would be needed to prove its true nature.|$|E
5|$|For {{a stable}} orbit the ratio between the moon's orbital period Ps around its primary {{and that of}} the primary around its star Pp must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days to orbit its star, the maximum stable orbit for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that a moon with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or <b>brown</b> <b>dwarf</b> that orbits 1 AU from a Sun-like star. In the case of Gliese 876 b, the orbital period would have to be no greater than a week (7 days) {{in order to have a}} stable orbit.|$|E

HIP 78530 b orbits a young, hot, bright blue star in the Upper Scorpius association.

40|$|The {{observational}} {{properties of}} <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs</b> pose {{challenges to the}} theory of star formation.

5|$|Its {{estimated}} mass is over 23.04 {{times that of}} Jupiter.

The average distance between dwarf planet Pluto and the Sun is 39.482 AU, meaning that HIP 78530 b orbits its host star nearly eighteen times further than Pluto orbits the Sun. In accordance with the data, HIP 78530 b would complete an orbit approximately every 12,000 years, although the actual orbital motion of HIP 78530 b is most likely smaller than 710 AU, {{but it has not}} been directly observed long enough to know definitively.|$|E

40|$|We use N-body {{simulations}} {{to compare}} the evolution of spatial distributions of stars and <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs</b> in young star-forming regions. We use three different diagnostics: the ratio of stars to <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs</b> {{as a function of}} distance from the region's centre, R_ SSR, the local surface density of stars compared to <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs,</b> ΣLDR, and we compare the global spatial distributions using the ΛMSR method. From a suite of 20 initially statistically identical simulations, 6 / 20 attain R_ SSR≪ 1 and ΣLDR≪ 1 and ΛMSR≪ 1, indicating that dynamical interactions could be responsible for observed differences in the spatial distributions of stars and <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs</b> in star-forming regions. However, many simulations also display apparently contradictory results - for example, in some cases the <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs</b> have much lower local densities than stars (ΣLDR≪ 1), but their global spatial distributions are indistinguishable (ΛMSR= 1) and the relative proportion of stars and <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs</b> remains constant across the region (R_ SSR = 1). Our results suggest that extreme caution should be exercised when interpreting any observed difference in the spatial distribution of stars and <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs,</b> and that a much larger observational sample of regions/clusters (with complete mass functions) is necessary to investigate whether or not <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs</b> form through similar mechanisms to star...|$|R

5|$|The {{discovery}} of a Jupiter-sized planetary companion was announced in 1997 via analysis of the radial velocity of Rho Coronae Borealis, a yellow main sequence star and Solar analog of spectral type G0V, around 57 light-years distant from Earth. More accurate measurement of data from the Hipparcos satellite subsequently showed it instead to be a low-mass star somewhere between 100 and 200 times the mass of Jupiter. Possible stable planetary orbits in the habitable zone were calculated for the binary star Eta Coronae Borealis, which is composed of two stars—yellow main sequence stars of spectral type G1V and G3V respectively—similar in mass and spectrum to the Sun. No planet has been found, but a <b>brown</b> <b>dwarf</b> companion about 63 times as massive as Jupiter with a spectral type of L8 was discovered {{at a distance of}} 3640AU from the pair in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} redefinition was criticised as ambiguous: Astronomer Phil Plait and NCSE writer Nick Matzke both {{wrote about}} why they thought the redefinition was not, in general, a good one.

A similar situation already applied to the term 'moon', such bodies ceasing to be moons on being ejected from planetary orbit; this usage had widespread acceptance. Similarly, the redefinition did not differentiate between planets and <b>brown</b> <b>dwarf</b> stars. Any attempt to clarify this differentiation was to be left until a later date.|$|E
