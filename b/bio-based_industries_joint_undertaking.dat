40|$|The <b>Bio-Based</b> <b>Industries</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Undertaking</b> (BBI JU) is a {{public-private}} partnership (PPP) 1 between the European Commission and the Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC). The Council Regulation (EU) No 560 / 2014 sets {{the basis for}} the establishment of the <b>Bio-based</b> <b>Industries</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Undertaking</b> (BBI JU). 2 BIC developed the Strategic Innovation and Research Agenda (SIRA) based on extensive consultation with public and private stakeholders. As per all the seven JUs, BBI JU awards Horizon 2020 funding for projects based on competitive calls. Five JUs were already set up in 2007 - 2008 under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7), whereas Bio-based Industries (BBI) is one of the newly established JUs under Horizon 2020 with the specific aim of developing sustainable and competitive bio-based industries in Europe. BBI JU set out financial commitments from both the EU and from the industry members in order to provide funding for large-scale, longer-term and high risk/reward research. The objectives of BBI JU may best be achieved by the Partnerships and, most importantly, by bringing together of companies, universities, research centres, innovative SMEs and other groups and organisations around the topic of the bio-based economy, which is of great industrial and social relevance. BBI JU {{is expected to be a}} concrete example of the European Union's efforts towards strengthening its competitiveness through scientific excellence, industry led research, openness and innovation. According to Article 32 (3) of the Horizon 2020 Regulation, the Commission must provide an in-depth assessment of all JUs. Article 11 (1) of BBI JU regulation 3 provides the main legal basis for this interim evaluation, which was carried out by a group of five independent experts who analysed the activities of BBI JU in the period 2014 - 2016. The evaluation takes place at an early stage, less than three years after the adoption of Regulation (EU) No. 560 / 2014, which established the BBI JU. It covers five main evaluation criteria: relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, coherence and EU added value. 4, 5 Although at the time point of this interim evaluation none of the research projects funded by BBI JU had been completed, qualitative input in combination with quantitative information, as was available, were used to assess the effectiveness of implementation and the main achievements so far...|$|E

40|$|The {{vast and}} ever-growing amount of {{agricultural}} and food wastes {{has become a}} major concern throughout the whole world. Therefore, strategies for their processing and value-added reuse are needed to enable a sustainable utilization of feedstocks and reduce the environmental burden. By-products of potato, tomato, cereals and olive arise in significant amounts in European countries and are consequently of high relevance. Due to their composition with various beneficial ingredients, the waste products can be valorized by different techniques leading to economic and environmental advantages. This paper focuses on the waste generation during industrial processing of potato, tomato, cereals and olives within the European Union and reviews state-of-the-art technologies for their valorization. Furthermore, current applications, future perspectives and challenges are discussed. This work was carried out in the framework of the AgriMax project (Valorization of agricultural residues and side streams from the agro-food industry), which is supported by the European Commission and has received funding from the Bio Based <b>Industries</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Undertaking</b> under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the grant agreement No. 720719...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bio-based</b> <b>industries</b> (pulp {{and paper}} and biorefineries) produce > 50 Mt/yr of lignin {{that results from}} {{fractionation}} of lignocellulosic biomass. Lignin is world's second biopolymer and a major potential source for production of performance materials and aromatic chemicals. Lignin valorization is a key-issue for enhanced profitability of sustainable <b>bio-based</b> <b>industries.</b> Despite a myriad of potential applications for lignin and decades of research, its heterogeneity and recalcitrance still preclude commercial value-added applications. Most lignin is utilized for heat and power. Unconventional solutions are needed to better exploit lignin's potential. Organosolv lignins are especially suitable as feedstock for high-value chemicals. At ECN, a lignin biorefinery approach (LIBRA) has been developed, involving a dedicated lignin pyrolysis protocol that is robust, continuous, and capable of processing different lignins. Typical product yields are 20 % gas, 35 % char, and 45 % oil. The oil contains approximately 45 % oligomeric phenolic substances, 23 % monomeric phenols, and 33 % water. The future perspective is scale-up of the process to produce larger lignin pyrolysis oil samples for separation, purification, and industrial application tests. Presently, small lignin pyrolysis oil samples are investigated as feedstock for extracting high-value chemicals, {{as a substitute for}} phenol in several applications, and as a feedstock for hydrotreating. The biochar is tested as growth enhancer and as substitute for carbon-black in rubber. Regarding the large lignin side streams from (future) <b>bio-based</b> <b>industries,</b> the LIBRA pyrolysis technology has ample potential to increase the profitability of lignocellulosic biorefineries provided that for both the liquid product and the solid char value-added applications are developed...|$|R
40|$|Processing biomass into multi-functional {{components}} {{can contribute}} to the increasing demand for raw materials for feed and bio-based non-food products. This contribution aims to demonstrate synergy between the <b>bio-based</b> <b>industry</b> and the feed industry through bioreﬁnery of currently used feed ingredients. Illustrating the bioreﬁnery concept, rapeseed was selected as a low priced feed ingredient based on market prices versus crude protein, crude fat and apparent ileal digestible lysine content. In addition it is already used a s an alternative protein source in diets and can b e cultivated in European climate zones. Furthermore, inclusion level of rapeseed meal in pig diet is limited because of its nutritionally ac tive factors. A conceptual process was developed to improve rapeseeds nutritional value and producing other bio-based building blocks simultaneously. Based on the correlation between market prices of feed ingredients and its protein and fat content, the value of reﬁned products was estimated. Finally, a sensitivity analysis, under two proﬁt scenario, shows that the process is economically feasible. This study demonstrates that using bioreﬁnery processes on feed ingredients can improve feed quality. In conjunction, it produces building blocks for a <b>bio-based</b> <b>industry</b> and creates synergy between <b>bio-based</b> and feed <b>industry</b> for more eﬃcient use of biomass. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The Workshop "A global view of {{bio-based}} industries: benchmarking {{and monitoring}} their economic importance and future developments", organised {{in the framework}} of the EU-Brazil Sector Dialogues, brought together relevant experts from the EU, the US, Canada and Brazil, to describe the strategies that are in place in their own countries about the nascent Bioeconomy and the initiatives taken so far to measure this sector and understand its relevance. The specific focus is on the most innovative <b>bio-based</b> <b>industry</b> and the emerging issues for its precise measurement and analysis. The workshop provided a very useful forum of exchange of information about different scopes within the broad concept of Bioeconomy, different needs for specific data and indicators and different methodologies developed to address the needs.
