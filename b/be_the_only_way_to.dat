5|$|The UN spent $1.6billion from 1994 to 1998 in {{maintaining}} a peacekeeping force.

Dos Santos told the delegates the next day that he believed war to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> ultimately achieve peace, rejected the Lusaka Protocol, and asked MONUA to leave. In February 1999, the Security Council withdrew the last MONUA personnel. In late 1998, several UNITA commanders, dissatisfied with Savimbi's leadership, formed UNITA Renovada, a breakaway militant group. Thousands more deserted UNITA in 1999 and 2000.|$|E

5|$|Applewhite {{began to}} {{emphasize}} a strict hierarchy, teaching that his students needed his guidance, as {{he needed the}} guidance of the Next Level. Zeller notes that this naturally ensured {{that there would be no}} possibility of the group's continuing if Applewhite were to die. A relationship with Applewhite was said to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> salvation; he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ. Zeller states that the group's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite's role as a mediator. Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but, in the 1980s, the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the gods}} and goddesses meet and hold a thing to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god Heimdallr puts forth the {{suggestion}} that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women's clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace Brísingamen. Thor rejects the idea, yet Loki interjects that this will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get back Mjöllnir. Loki points out that, without Mjöllnir, the jötnar {{will be able to}} invade and settle in Asgard. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to Jötunheimr together.|$|E
5|$|Believing Joshua {{will attempt}} another {{break-in}} but will avoid putting innocents in danger, Olivia has Fringe Division statistician Astrid identify three remotely located banks {{and decides to}} investigate them. Olivia finds the bank that Joshua has targeted and discovers his device in a subway tunnel, but he knocks her out before she can investigate further. As he energizes the molecular destabilizer, Fringe Division detects the event and converges on the bank. Matthew eventually finds Joshua, again trying to warn him off, but quickly realizes Joshua has purposely entered the bank to be trapped in the amber. Joshua believes this to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> force the Fringe team to end their investigation. Matthew escapes the quarantine while Fringe agents Charlie and Lincoln rescue Olivia in time before the amber sets in. Olivia returns to Matthew {{the next day and}} confirms the case is closed, but not before collecting a skin sample that, should she ever need it, conclusively proves that it was Matthew in the amber before.|$|E

25|$|In March 1833, {{the capital}} of the state was {{transferred}} from Saltillo to Monclova. The following year, centralists began urging Santa Anna to overturn the federal system and introduce centralism. Some legislators believed that centralism would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> retain Texas, as newspapers in the United States continued to make statements about the forthcoming annexation of Texas. When the national congress attempted to centralize the nation, a civil war ensued. As fighting erupted, Saltillo declared that Monclova had been illegally made the state capitol and selected its own governor. Texans in Saltillo recommended establishing a provisional government in Bexar during the unrest to strengthen the autonomy of Texas. Juan Seguin, political chief of Bexar, called for a town meeting to create a government but was forced to postpone it when Mexican troops advanced in the direction of Texas.|$|E
25|$|David Ervine was the {{youngest}} of five children born to Walter and Elizabeth Ervine, and raised in a Protestant working-class area of east Belfast between the Albertbridge and Newtownards roads. His household was not loyalist at all, his father Walter described himself as a socialist, had no time for Ian Paisley and didn't attend church. When Ervine joined the Orange Order aged 18, he said he was the first member of his family to ever be a member. His membership however didn't last long. Like many in his situation, he grew up closely identifying with his community and absorbed the Ulster Unionism ideals and opinions that go along with this identity. He left Orangefield High School at 14, and at the age of 19 Ervine joined the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), believing this to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> ensure the defence of the Protestant community after the events of Bloody Friday. A neighbour of Ervine's {{who was a member of}} the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) William Irvine, had died in one of the bomb blasts on Bloody Friday.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{previously}} {{believed that}} the skin was an effective barrier to inorganic particles. Damage from mechanical stressors was believed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> increase its permeability. Recently, however, simpler and more effective methods for increasing skin permeability have been developed. For example, ultraviolet radiation (UVR) {{has been used to}} slightly damage the surface of skin, causing a time-dependent defect allowing easier penetration of nanoparticles. The UVR’s high energy causes a restructuring of cells, weakening the boundary between the stratum corneum and the epidermal layer. The damage of the skin is typically measured by the transepidermal water loss (TEWL), though it may take 3–5 days for the TEWL to reach its peak value. When the TEWL reaches its highest value, the maximum density of nanoparticles is able to permeate the skin. Studies confirm that UVR damaged skin significantly increases the permeability. The effects of increased permeability after UVR exposure can lead to {{an increase in the number}} of particles that permeate the skin. However, the specific permeability of skin after UVR exposure relative to particles of different sizes and materials has not been determined.|$|E

500|$|In January 2014, Havas Worldwide and the Turkish {{branch of}} the condom company Durex created a {{television}} commercial titled [...] "Farewell Elizabeth" [...] that parodied Oobi. It featured a man breaking up with his girlfriend and resorting to dating his right hand, which was dressed up {{like one of the}} characters from the series. The Oobi hand puppet (named [...] "Elizabeth") was intended to be a metaphor for masturbation, which is generally regarded as a taboo subject in the country. The company had produced other anti-masturbation advertisements in the past, all of which were unsuccessful in Turkey. Havas Worldwide stated in an interview with La República that they chose to parody Oobi after deciding that doing [...] "something never said or done" [...] before would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make such a commercial popular with Turkish viewers.|$|E
500|$|During the day, the Foreign Office held further {{talks with}} diplomats from Arabian {{countries}} {{in the hope of}} persuading them to go to the embassy and talk to the hostage-takers. The talks, hosted by Douglas Hurd, ended in stalemate. The diplomats insisted they must be able to offer safe passage out of the UK for the gunmen, believing this to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> guarantee a peaceful outcome, but the British government was adamant that safe passage would not be considered under any circumstances. Karkhouti, through whom Oan had issued his revised demands the previous day, became increasingly ill throughout the day and by the evening was feverish, which led to suggestions that the police had spiked the food that had been sent into the embassy. John Dellow, the commander of the police operation, had apparently considered the idea and even consulted a doctor about its viability, but eventually dismissed it as [...] "impracticable".|$|E
500|$|A {{second problem}} is the {{difficulty}} of comparisons across cultures.

[...] In-depth surveys may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get necessary information desired, but they {{make it difficult to}} perform cross-cultural comparisons. The lack of adequate universal terminology in discussing unpaid work is an example. [...] "Despite increasing recognition that domestic labor is work, existing vocabularies do not easily convey the new appreciations. People still tend to talk about work and home as if they were separate spheres. 'Working mothers' are usually assumed to be in the paid labor force, despite feminist assertions that 'every mother is a working mother.' There are no readily accepted terms to express different work activities or job titles. Housewife, home manager, homemaker are all problematic and none of them conveys the sense of a women who juggles both domestic labor and paid employment." ...|$|E

500|$|Unlike most action games, stealth games {{challenge}} the player to avoid alerting enemies altogether. The core gameplay {{elements of the}} modern stealth game are to avoid combat, minimize noise, and strike enemies from the shadows. Completing objectives without being detected by any enemy, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "ghosting" [...] is a common approach to stealth games. Avoiding detection may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> successfully complete a game, but there are usually multiple ways to achieve a goal with different pathways or styles of play. Players can hide behind objects or in shadows, and can strike or run past an enemy when the enemy is facing the other way. If the player attracts the attention of enemies, they usually must hide and wait until the enemies abandon their search. Thus, planning becomes important, as does trial-and-error. However, some stealth games put more emphasis on physical combat skill when the player is spotted. Some games offer a choice between killing or merely knocking out an enemy. When ghosting is optional, or even not well-supported by a game, players may still attempt to avoid combat for moral reasons or as a demonstration of skill.|$|E
500|$|In July 2011, Scott {{said that}} he was filming Prometheus with both adult-oriented R and more {{accessible}} PG-13 film ratings in mind, allowing the more adult content to be cut if necessary without harming the overall presentation. Scott said he had a responsibility to 20th Century Fox to be able to present a PG-13 cut of the film if the studio demanded, allowing it to be viewed by a wider potential audience. When asked about the rating, Scott said, [...] "the question is, do you go for the PG-13, or do you go for what it should be, which is R? Financially it makes quite a difference... essentially it's kinda R... it's not just about blood, it's about ideas that are very stressful." [...] Scott also said that, regardless of rating, he would present the most aggressive cut of the film he could, while Rothman said that Scott would not be forced to compromise the film's quality to avoid an R-rating. On May 7, 2012, Fox confirmed that the film had received an R-rating and would be released without any cuts being made. According to Scott, the scene of Shaw surgically removing her alien offspring was the significant cause of the restrictive rating, and it was suggested that removing the scene entirely would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> gain a lower one. A fight scene between Shaw and the Engineer was shortened because Scott decided that Shaw directly wounding the Engineer diminished his role. Scott concluded work on the film in March 2012.|$|E
