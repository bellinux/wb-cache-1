5000|$|Barker later rewrote {{the ending}} of the sketch, citing the reason as dissatisfaction with the obscurity and {{coarseness}} of the <b>bill-hooks</b> reference.

5000|$|A {{display of}} a male {{involved}} fluffing its feathers, holding the bill high and flicking wings while swaying from side to side. A female was observed flicking its tail and pressing it down with wings drooped before being mounted by a male. They are brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nest of host species. The host species for the yellow-rumped honeyguide are as yet unknown and undocumented. Young birds of honeyguide species have <b>bill-hooks</b> with which they destroy the eggs and chicks of the host. The male hold territories around hives and are polygynous, allowing females with whom it had mated and their young into the territories. This mating system has been termed as [...] "resource-based non-harem polygyny".|$|R
60|$|He looked up, and {{perceived}} two life-size portraits on panels {{built into the}} masonry.

I warrant you the lances cracked and shivered like faggots under old Purkis's <b>bill-hook.</b> And that you should liefer pore over crabbed monkish stuff with yonder old men! My life on it, there must be some spell!" ...|$|E
60|$|The horses drew up on {{reaching}} the hedge of stakes. Their riders {{could give them}} no guidance, for without deigning to move from their order the archers continued to keep up their storm of arrows, which at such close quarters pierced all but the very finest armour, while it was certain death to the knights to raise their heads to get {{a glance at the}} situation. The horses, maddened with the pain of the arrows, soon settled the matter. Some turned and rushed off madly, carrying confusion into the ranks of the first division, others galloped off to the right or left, and of the twelve hundred men who charged, three only broke through the line of stakes, and these were instantly killed by the <b>bill-hooks</b> and axes of the archers.|$|R
60|$|It {{cannot be}} {{denied that the}} young party were a little {{disappointed}} by the aspect of the renowned Whistlefar, but they did ample justice to all {{that was to be}} seen; a few yards of very thick stone wall in the court, a coat of arms carved upon a stone built into the wall upside down, and the well-turned arch of the door-way. Some, putting on Don Quixote's eyes for the occasion, saw helmets in milk-pails, dungeons in cellars, battle-axes in <b>bill-hooks,</b> and shields in pewter-plates, called the baby in its cradle the sleeping Princess, agreed that the shield must have been reversed by order of the palmer, and that one of the cows was the mischievous knight's cream-coloured donkey; so that laughter happily supplied the place of learned lore.|$|R
60|$|The {{alarm bell}} of the convent had done its work. The villagers were up, enraged by the outrage, and armed with sticks and scythes and <b>bill-hooks,</b> {{an army of}} them was {{charging}} to avenge this infamy. The troopers reached the close no more than in time. Sergeant Flanagan, only half understanding the reason for so much anger, but understanding that this anger was very real and very dangerous, was desperately defending the horses with his two companions against {{the vanguard of the}} assailants. There was a swift rush of the dragoons and in an instant they were in the saddle, all but the lieutenant, of whose absence they were suddenly made conscious. Flanagan would have gone back for him, and he had in fact begun to issue an order with that object when a sudden surge of the swelling, roaring crowd cut off the dragoons from the door through which they had emerged. Sitting their horses, the little troop came together, their sabres drawn, solid as a rock in that angry human sea that surged about them. The moon riding now clear overhead irradiated that scene of impending strife.|$|R
60|$|Amid {{this scene}} Tess slaved {{in the morning}} frosts and in the {{afternoon}} rains. When it was not swede-grubbing it was swede-trimming, in which process they sliced off {{the earth and the}} fibres with a <b>bill-hook</b> before storing the roots for future use. At this occupation they could shelter themselves by a thatched hurdle if it rained; but if it was frosty even their thick leather gloves could not prevent the frozen masses they handled from biting their fingers. Still Tess hoped. She had a conviction that sooner or later the magnanimity which she persisted in reckoning as a chief ingredient of Clare's character would lead him to rejoin her.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{horse is}} spent, but not my strength," [...] Edgar said, as he reined up. [...] "Well, we have avenged the Flemings, {{and have done}} {{something}} towards paying these fellows for their insults to the princess. Now let us wend our way back; I must say good-bye to Sir Ralph and the sturdy alderman, and will then ride home and see how my father has fared. I have little fear that any harm has befallen him, for his magic would frighten the rioters even more than our swords. Well, our armour has stood us in good stead, Albert. When we charged the first time I was several times struck with <b>bill-hook</b> and pike, {{and more than one}} arrow shivered on my breast- piece, but I found that the blows all fell harmless, and after that I wasted no pains in defending myself, but simply struck straightforward blows at my opponents." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{young woman}} {{laid down the}} <b>bill-hook</b> {{for a moment and}} {{examined}} the palm of her right hand, which, unlike the other, was ungloved, and showed little hardness or roughness about it. The palm was red and blistering, as if this present occupation were not frequent enough with her to subdue it to what it worked in. As with so many right hands born to manual labor, there was nothing in its fundamental shape to bear out the physiological conventionalism that gradations of birth, gentle or mean, show themselves primarily in the form of this member. Nothing but a cast of the die of destiny had decided that the girl should handle the tool; and the fingers which clasped the heavy ash haft might have skilfully guided the pencil or swept the string, had they only been set to do it in good time.|$|E
50|$|In Acanthus both {{adults and}} {{children}} were buried {{in the same area}} according to ancient burial customs. Various grave types have been discovered - some are simple dirt holes, others coated with clay or undecorated or painted clay urns, yet others are shaped like boxes, covered in clay or jug-shaped (jug-shaped most probably constituted the majority of infant or child burials). The grave goods, usually placed in the graves next to or above the dead, are varied and sometimes in earthen containers. Often they were personal or related to their occupation (such as jewels, pins, buckles, mirrors, weapons - though these are rare -, needles, hooks, <b>bill-hooks,</b> knives or - very often in female and child graves - clay figurines representing various animals, foodstuffs, or human forms, such as actors). Some of the goods are locally made whilst some are from other commercial centres and workshops of the ancient world. Burial customs, and similar types of graves which have been discovered, resemble many other cemeteries in other ancient Greek cities of Macedonia and Thrace. This Reveals the connection they had through trade with them {{as well as with the}} other well-known centres of southern Greece (especially Euboea, Athens, Corinth and Boeotia).|$|R

6000|$|Knyphausen, we say, proved futile; {{nor could}} human wit have succeeded. The exasperated Duke was contumacious, irrational; the two Majesties kept pulling {{different}} ways upon him. Matters grew from very bad to worse; and Mecklenburg continued long a running sore. Not many months after this (I think, still in 1729), the irrational Duke, having got {{money out of}} Russia, came home again from Dantzig; to notable increase of the Anarchies in Mecklenburg, though without other result for himself. The irrational Duke proved more contumacious than ever, fell into deeper trouble than ever;--at length (1733) he made Proclamation to the Peasantry to rise and fight for him; who did turn out, with their <b>bill-hooks</b> and bludgeons, under Captains named by him, [...] "to the amount of 18,000 Peasants,"--with such riot as may be fancied, but without other result. So that the Hanover Commissioners decided to seize the very RESIDENZ Cities (Schwerin and Domitz) from this mad Duke, and make the country clear of him,--his Brother being Interim Manager always, under countenance of the Commissioners. Which transactions, especially which contemplated seizure of the Residence Cities, Friedrich Wilhelm, eventual heir, could not see with equanimity at all. But having no forces in the country, what could he do? Being [...] "Joint-Commissioner" [...] this long while past, though without armed interference hitherto, he privately resolves {{that he will have}} forces there; the rather as the poor Duke professes penitence, and flies to him for help. Poor soul, his Russian Unique of Wives has just died, far enough away from him this long while past: what a life they have had, these two Uniques!-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Several {{days had}} passed since her futile journey, and Tess was afield. The dry winter wind still blew, but a screen of {{thatched}} hurdles erected {{in the eye of}} the blast kept its force away from her. On the sheltered side was a turnip-slicing machine, whose bright blue hue of new paint seemed almost vocal in the otherwise subdued scene. Opposite its front was a long mound or [...] "grave", in which the roots had been preserved since early winter. Tess was standing at the uncovered end, chopping off with a <b>bill-hook</b> the fibres and earth from each root, and throwing it after the operation into the slicer. A man was turning the handle of the machine, and from its trough came the newly-cut swedes, the fresh smell of whose yellow chips was accompanied by the sounds of the snuffling wind, the smart swish of the slicing-blades, and the choppings of the hook in Tess's leather-gloved hand.|$|E
60|$|In {{the room}} from which this cheerful blaze proceeded, he beheld a girl seated on a willow chair, and busily {{occupied}} {{by the light of}} the fire, which was ample and of wood. With a <b>bill-hook</b> in one hand and a leather glove, much too large for her, on the other, she was making spars, such as are used by thatchers, with great rapidity. She wore a leather apron for this purpose, which was also much too large for her figure. On her left hand lay a bundle of the straight, smooth sticks called spar-gads--the raw material of her manufacture; on her right, a heap of chips and ends--the refuse--with which the fire was maintained; in front, a pile of the finished articles. To produce them she took up each gad, looked critically at it from end to end, cut it to length, split it into four, and sharpened each of the quarters with dexterous blows, which brought it to a triangular point precisely resembling that of a bayonet.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was close}} to this spot {{that one of the}} few adventures {{occurred}} which marked, in my mind, my boyish days with importance. When loitering beyond the castle, on the way to school, with a brother somewhat older than myself, who was uniformly my champion and protector, we espied a round sloe high up in the hedge-row. We determined to obtain it; and I do not remember whether both of us, or only my brother, climbed the tree. However, when the prize was all but reached,--and no alchemist ever looked more eagerly for the moment of projection which was to give him immortality and omnipotence,--a gruff voice startled us with an oath, and an order to desist; and I well recollect looking back, for long after, with terror to the vision of an old and ill-tempered farmer, armed with a <b>bill-hook,</b> and vowing our decapitation; nor did I subsequently remember without triumph the eloquence whereby alone, in my firm belief, my brother and myself had been rescued from instant death.|$|E
6000|$|It {{seems as}} if all the foliage which ought to have grown on the Cornish moorlands, had been mischievously crammed into this place, within the narrow limits of one Cornish valley. Weeds, ferns, brambles, bushes, and young trees, are flourishing {{together}} here, thickly intertwined in every possible position, in triumphant security from any invasion of <b>bill-hook</b> or axe. You win every step of your way through this miniature forest of vegetation, by the labour of your arms and the weight of your body. Tangled branches and thorny bushes press against you in front and behind, meet over your head, knock off your cap, flap in your face, twist about your legs, and tear your coat skirts; so obstructing you in every conceivable manner and in every conceivable direction, that they seem possessed with a living power of opposition, and commissioned by some evil genius of Fairy Mythology to prevent mortal footsteps from intruding into the valley. Whether you try a zig-zag or a straight course, whether you go up or down, it is the same thing--you must squeeze, and push, and jostle your way through the crowd of bushes, just as you would through a crowd of men--or else stand still, surrounded by leaves, like [...] "a Jack-in-the-Green," [...] and wait for the very remote chance of somebody coming to help you out.|$|E
60|$|The {{second line}} of battle {{was now in}} disorder, broken by the {{fugitive}} men and horses of Sir Clugnet's party, smitten with the arrows to {{which they had been}} exposed as that party melted away, and by those of the English archers in the wood on their flank. The confusion heightened every moment as wounded knights tried to withdraw from the fight, and others from behind struggled to take their places in front. Soon the disorder became terrible. The archers plucked up their stakes and ran forward; the French line recoiled at their approach in order to get into fairer order; and the archers, with loud shouts of victory, slung their bows behind them, dropped the stakes, and with axe and <b>bill-hook</b> rushed at the horsemen. These were too tightly wedged together to use their lances, and as they had retired they had come into newly-ploughed ground, which had been so soaked by the heavy rain that the horses sank in the deep mud to their knees, many almost to their bellies. Into the midst of this helpless crowd of armed men the English archers burst. Embarrassed by their struggling horses, scarcely able to wield their arms in the press, seeing but scantily, and that only in front through the narrow slits of their vizors, the chivalry of France died almost unresistingly.|$|E
6000|$|Schlesien--will {{the reader}} learn {{to call it}} by that name, on occasion? for in these sad Manuscripts of ours the names alternate--is a fine, fertile, useful and {{beautiful}} Country. It leans sloping, as we hinted, to the East and to the North; a long curved buttress of Mountains ("RIESENGEBIRGE, Giant Mountains," [...] is their best-known name in foreign countries) holding {{it up on the}} South and West sides. This Giant-Mountain Range,--which is a kind of continuation of the Saxon-Bohemian [...] "Metal Mountains (ERZGEBIRGE)" [...] and of the straggling Lausitz Mountains, to westward of these,--shapes itself like a <b>bill-hook</b> (or elliptically, as was said): handle and hook together may be some 200 miles in length. The precipitous side of this is, in general, turned outwards, towards Bohmen, Mahren, Ungarn (Bohemia, Moravia, Hungary, in our dialects); and Schlesien lies inside, irregularly sloping down, towards the Baltic and towards the utmost East, From the Bohemian side of these Mountains there rise two Rivers: Elbe, tending for the West; Morawa for the South;--Morawa, crossing Moravia, gets into the Donau, and thence into the Black-Sea; while Elbe, after intricate adventures among the mountains, and then prosperously across the plains, is out, with its many ships, into the Atlantic. Two rivers, we say, from the Bohemian or steep side: and again, from the Silesian side, there rise other two, the Oder and the Weichsel (VISTULA); which start pretty near one another in the Southeast, and, after wide windings, get both into the Baltic, at a good distance apart.|$|E
