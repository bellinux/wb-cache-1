[...] However, he served for just one year, {{and was replaced by}} Winthrop in 1642. [...] Bellingham's defeat may have been caused in part by the scandalous impropriety surrounding his second marriage. [...] A friend who was a guest in his house had been courting Penelope Pelham, a young woman of twenty. [...] According to Winthrop, Bellingham, now 50 and a widower, won her heart, and, without waiting for the formalities of the <b>banns</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> officiated at his own wedding. [...] When the issue came before the colonial magistrates, Bellingham (as the governor and chief magistrate) refused to step down from the bench to face the charges, thus bringing the matter to a somewhat awkward end. [...] Bellingham's term in office was characterized by Winthrop as extremely difficult: [...] "The General Court was full of uncomfortable agitations and contentions by reason of Bellingham's unfriendliness to some other magistrates. [...] He set himself in an opposite frame to them in all proceedings, which did much to retard business".|$|E

50|$|At the Hillsborough meeting (30 October 1834) Cooke, in the {{presence}} of forty thousand people, published the <b>banns</b> <b>of</b> a <b>marriage</b> between the established and Presbyterian churches of Ireland. The alliance was to be politico-religious, not ecclesiastical, a union for conserving the interests of Protestantism against the political combination of the Roman catholic, 'the Socinian, and the infidel'. Still more thoroughly did he succeed in his political mission by his dealing with O'Connell's visit to Belfast in January 1841. Cooke's challenge to a public discussion of facts and principles was evaded by O'Connell. The anti-repeal meeting which followed O'Connell's abortive demonstration was famed in Ulster. Almost his last platform appearance was at Hillsborough on 30 October 1867, when, in his eightieth year, Cooke spoke against the threatened disestablishment of Protestantism in Ireland. On 5 March 1868 he attended the inaugural meeting of an Ulster Protestant defence association. In the same sense was the address (24 October 1868) to the Protestant electors of Ireland, penned almost on his deathbed.|$|R

Buckingham was soon suspected of organizing a Presbyterian plot against the government. An order was issued for his arrest on 9 October, despite Fairfax's interest with Cromwell. He was placed under house arrest at York House in April 1658, escaped, and was rearrested on 18 August. He was then imprisoned in the Tower of London until his mother and father-in-law negotiated his release on 23 February 1659. He was freed after promising not to assist the enemies of the government, and on Fairfax's security of £20,000. He joined Fairfax in his march against General John Lambert in January 1660, and afterwards claimed to have gained Fairfax to the cause of the Restoration.|$|R

The idea of Edward's being a clergyman, and living in a small parsonage-house, diverted him beyond measure;--and when to that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice, and publishing the <b>banns</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> between John Smith and Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.|$|E

40|$|The {{features}} <b>of</b> historical <b>marriage</b> patterns {{have been}} linked to debates in social and economic history about economic growth and female agency. However, {{there is a lack of}} empirical evidence on the demographics <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> prior to the nineteenth century. Here, we study trends in sex-specific ages at first marriage, regional variation and the impact of migration on marital timing in the Netherlands in the period 1650 - 1900. We make use of two new large historical datasets, namely an aggregation of Dutch genealogies and the transcribed <b>marriage</b> <b>banns</b> <b>of</b> Amsterdam. This allows us to understand the features and developments <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> ages from a long-term perspective in what is known as one of the core-areas of the so-called European Marriage Pattern. Our results show high marriage ages for both sexes from the beginning of our study period, increasing until the mid- 19 th century. A closer look at regional variation reveals clear differences between the provinces and between urban and rural settings with those in the western part of the country and in urban centers marrying earlier. Migrating individuals married on average later than non-migrating individuals both compared to men and women in the receiving community, as to the ‘stayers’ in the location of origin. As later marriage implies a reduction of the window of fertility, especially for women, our results suggest that migration and increasing regional mobility might have been an important driver of the demographic shift toward higher marriage ages and lower fertility in Europe between the 17 th and 19 th centuries...|$|R

In the fullness of his heart he at once bought a most unwearable black bonnet with lilac flowers and red berries, which he brought in triumph to his wife, who, good woman, affected extreme delight, and afterwards cut away all the obnoxious finery and replaced it to her own taste. The scanty congregation was no less surprised when they heard that Tobias Clutterbuck, bachlelor, was about to marry Lavinia Scully, widow, and that Thomas Dimsdale, bachelor, was to do as much to Catherine Harston, spinster. They communicated the tidings to their friends, and the result was a great advertisement to the little church, so that the incumbent preached his favourite sermon upon barren fig trees to a crowded audience, and received such an offertory as had never entered into his wildest dreams.|$|E

50|$|The {{policy of}} the Roman Catholic Church, and later various protestant churches, <b>of</b> {{considering}} clandestine <b>marriages</b> and marriages made without parental consent to be valid was controversial, and in the 16th century both the French monarchy and the Lutheran Church sought to end these practices, with limited success. Before 1929, Scots law followed Roman law in allowing a girl to marry at twelve {{years of age and}} a boy at fourteen, without any requirement for parental consent. However, marriage in Scotland at such young ages was in practice almost unknown. In England and Wales, the Marriage Act 1753 required a marriage to be covered by a licence (requiring parental consent for those under 21) or the publication <b>of</b> <b>banns</b> (which parents <b>of</b> those under 21 could forbid).|$|R

Because <b>banns</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> are accepted as a fully legal way to perform a marriage {{without the need for}} a city-issued marriage license, but marriages performed under either process require certification by the provincial registrar, the banns created a legal vacuum that would force a court case.|$|E

60|$|It {{is to be}} {{observed}} that all the entries here are of births, not of baptisms, departing from the general rule of Church registers, {{and they are all}} in English; but in 1663 each child is recorded as baptized, and the Latin language is used. This looks much as if a regular clergyman, a scholar, too, had, after the Restoration, become curate of the parish. He does not sign his registers, so we do not know his name. In 1653 the <b>banns</b> <b>of</b> William Downe and Jane Newman were published September 17th and the two Lord's Days ensuing, but their wedding is not entered, and the first marriage recorded is that of Matthew Dummer and Jane Burt, in 1663.
