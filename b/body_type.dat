5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, Players can {{customize}} the protagonist's gender, <b>body</b> <b>type,</b> hairstyle, and outfit using the character creator. Players may also alter the look of their customized character at any point during the game by approaching a vendor named Callista. After creating their characters, players proceed to the game's open world, which is free for players to explore at any time. A fast travel system is provided allowing players to reach different locations and to navigate the world quickly. The game features a main campaign with story elements and side-missions, which are triggered automatically when players enter certain locations in the city. These quests mainly involve players delivering objects to other non-playable characters and collecting items from the world. Some of these quests have time limits.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between media images’ portrayal of the “thin ideal” and college women’s self-image and self-esteem. A {{review of the literature}} validated the researcher’s hypothesis that women are negatively affected by the media’s portrayal of “ideal” <b>body</b> <b>types.</b> However, the review of literature also presented a contrasting theme that media images can positively affect women through motivation and determination to maintain healthy lifestyles. A mixed methods study using Rosenberg’s Self Esteem Scale and media images portraying different <b>body</b> <b>types</b> was used to examine this relationship. Findings indicated that the level of the women’s self-esteem prior to completing the survey {{will have an impact on}} the level of women’s self-esteem after observing the images. In addition, findings gathered that women who have <b>body</b> <b>types</b> that are not considered “ideal” by society do not believe that their own <b>body</b> <b>types</b> are ideal; rather, <b>body</b> <b>types</b> that are more desired than their own are the “ideal” <b>body</b> <b>types</b> for which women should strive to resemble. An implication for future research and practice is concerned with the sensitivity of {{the relationship between}} media images’ portrayal of a “thin ideal” and college women’s self-esteem...|$|R

5000|$|In the 20th century, various {{theories}} were postulated. One set hypothesized multiple ancestral <b>body</b> <b>types</b> of {{the single}} species Equus ferus or the original wild horse, each adapted to a given environment. Another hypothesis held that prototypes originated from a single wild species and that all different <b>body</b> <b>types</b> were entirely a result of selective breeding after domestication. Yet another proposed that the theoretical prototypes were each separate species or subspecies. [...] These theories were all based on <b>body</b> <b>types</b> and conformation, prior to the availability of DNA for research, and have since been superseded by modern studies.|$|R

25|$|Objectification theory {{suggests}} both {{direct and indirect}} consequences of objectification to women. Indirect consequences include self consciousness in terms that a woman is consistently checking or rearranging her clothes or appearance to ensure that she is presentable. More direct consequences are related to sexual victimization. Rape and sexual harassment are examples of this. Doob (2012) states that sexual harassment {{is one of the}} challenges faced by women in workplace. This may constitute sexual jokes or comments, most of which are degrading. Research indicates that objectification theory is valuable to understanding how repeated visual images in the media are socialized and translated into mental health problems, including psychological consequences on the individual and societal level. These include increased self-consciousness, increased body anxiety, heightened mental health threats (depression, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and sexual dysfunction), and increased body shame. Therefore, the theory has been used to explore an array of dependent variables including disordered eating, mental health, depression, motor performance, body image, idealized <b>body</b> <b>type,</b> stereotype formation, sexual perception and sexual typing. Body shame is a byproduct of the concept of an idealized <b>body</b> <b>type</b> adopted by most Western cultures that depicts a thin, model-type figure. Thus, women will engage in actions meant to change their body such as dieting, exercise, eating disorders, cosmetic surgery, etc. Effects of objectification theory are identified on both the individual and societal levels.|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) {{whole body}} {{scanners}} are increasingly used as precise measuring tools for the rapid quantification of anthropometric measures in epidemiological studies. We analyzed 3 D whole body scanning data of nearly 10, 000 participants of a cohort {{collected from the}} adult population of Leipzig, {{one of the largest}} cities in Eastern Germany. We present a novel approach for the systematic analysis of this data which aims at identifying distinguishable clusters of body shapes called <b>body</b> <b>types.</b> In the first step, our method aggregates body measures provided by the scanner into meta-measures, each representing one relevant dimension of the body shape. In a next step, we stratified the cohort into <b>body</b> <b>types</b> and assessed their stability and dependence {{on the size of the}} underlying cohort. Using self-organizing maps (SOM) we identified thirteen robust meta-measures and fifteen <b>body</b> <b>types</b> comprising between 1 and 18 percent of the total cohort size. Thirteen of them are virtually gender specific (six for women and seven for men) and thus reflect most abundant body shapes of women and men. Two <b>body</b> <b>types</b> include both women and men, and describe androgynous body shapes that lack typical gender specific features. The <b>body</b> <b>types</b> disentangle a large variability of body shapes enabling distinctions which go beyond the traditional indices such as body mass index, the waist-to-height ratio, the waist-to-hip ratio and the mortality-hazard ABSI-index. In a next step, we will link the identified <b>body</b> <b>types</b> with disease predispositions to study how size and shape of the human body impact health and disease...|$|R

40|$|We have identified, and {{followed}} the development of three macrogamete organelles involved {{in the formation of}} the oocyst wall of Eimeria maxima. The first were small lucent vacuoles that cross-reacted with antibodies to the apple domains of the Toxoplasma gondii microneme protein 4. They appeared early in development and were secreted during macrogamete maturation to form an outer veil and were termed veil forming bodies. The second were the wall forming <b>bodies</b> <b>type</b> 1, large, electron dense vacuoles that stained positively only with antibodies raised to an enriched preparation of the native forms of 56 (gam 56), 82 (gam 82) and 230 kDa (gam 230) gametocyte antigens (termed anti-APGA). The third were the wall forming <b>bodies</b> <b>type</b> 2, which appeared before the wall forming <b>bodies</b> <b>type</b> 1 but remain enclosed within the rough endoplasmic reticulum and stained positively with antibodies raised to recombinant versions of gam 56 (anti-gam 56), gam 82 (anti-gam 82) and gam 230 (anti-gam 230) plus anti-APGA. At the initiation of oocyst wall formation, the anti-T. gondii microneme protein 4 positive outer veil detached from the surface. The outer layer of the oocyst wall was formed by the release of the contents of wall forming <b>bodies</b> <b>type</b> 1 at the surface to form an electron dense, anti-APGA positive layer. The wall forming <b>bodies</b> <b>type</b> 2 appeared, subsequently, to give rise to the electron lucent inner layer. Thus, oocyst wall formation in E. maxima represents a sequential release of the contents of the veil forming bodies, wall forming <b>bodies</b> <b>types</b> 1 and 2 and this may be controlled at the level of the rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi body...|$|R
