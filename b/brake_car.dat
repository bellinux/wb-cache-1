50|$|The trains were {{refurbished}} and overhauled in 1955, but by 1972 {{the stock}} was old and rode poorly by contemporary standards. Despite protests, the decision was taken not to replace the rolling stock and the service was withdrawn on 30 April 1972. Every car was preserved, in most cases to meet the ambitions of major breweries to 'bolt on' Pullman restaurants to pubs and hotels, although most were removed relatively quickly {{because of the high}} cost of maintenance and refurbishment. A number were progressively acquired by the Venice Simplon Orient Express, while one still remains in use as B&B accommodation at the Little Mill Inn, Rowarth, Derbyshire. Motor <b>brake</b> <b>car</b> 90 was used for passenger service on the Nene Valley Railway between 1980 and 1990, but was subsequently scrapped at Bury in 1995 following a series of arson attacks.|$|E
5000|$|The video, {{directed}} by Adrian Moat, shows three famous supercars driving and racing {{each other through}} several highways and mountain roads across a desert landscape from clear daylight to dawn. The cars on the video are a black Ferrari F355 Berlinetta, a purple Lamborghini Diablo SE30 and a red Ferrari F40. Jay Kay appears to be driving the purple Lamborghini with Stuart Zender on the co-pilot seat, but the drivers of the other cars are not shown in detail. It has four different edits: Versions 1-3, and the so-called 'Jay's cut' version. In a Top Gear interview, Jay Kay explained that before filming one car had been totalled during transportation, and the windscreen of the second was smashed {{after one of the}} precision drivers knocked the camera off the cliff: They made three of those special edition 30th-anniversary Diablos, and one was a Jota, so it was a 600 <b>brake</b> <b>car</b> that was not really road legal, so there were only two. So I had mine in storage, and the guy goes to stick it on the car transporter, and then I got word that he'd just totalled this car, there it is to picture on screen, and we kind of had to have a purple one, because it was the purple, the cosmic, you know it's just one of those things. So we got the other one. And I said [...] "look, wait until I get there, I'm flying in, just nobody drive it until I get there, please, we can't afford to smash it," [...] so I came off the plane, and everybody looked really downtrodden, looking at the floor, and I went [...] "Why are you looking so sad?", and they said [...] "one of the precision drivers has knocked the camera off the cliff, and taken out the front windscreen, so there's no windscreen, Lamborghini can't send one for another day or so," [...] so for most of the video, {{it had to be done}} with no windscreen, that's why you see me squinting, and actually trying to sing the song as well, while driving the mountain road. Jay Kay [...] The car that appears in the video was rented from a local collector. The F40 was provided by the Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason, who drove in the video as well. The video was filmed at the Cabo de Gata, in Spain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{temperature}} control of automotive brake discs during operation {{is a difficult}} process because they have shiny metallic surfaces moving rotational contact with fixed brake pads and different temperature gradients. The instrument used for measuring the temperature, {{in this case is}} the thermal camera, but requires precise calibration for the emissivity of the material being analyzed and the influence of environment. The study refers to changes depending on the temperature of thermal emissivity of the material disc <b>brake</b> <b>car,</b> both in static and in dynamic regime and determining analytical relationships to estimate this variation acceptable accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Along with house {{heating and}} industry, {{emissions}} from road traffic (exhaust and tire, <b>brake,</b> <b>car</b> body or road surface abrasions) {{are one of}} the primary sources of particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere in urban areas. Though numerous regulations and vehicle-control mechanisms have led to a significant decline of PM emissions from vehicle exhaust gases, other sources of PM remain related to road and car abrasion are responsible for non-exhaust emissions. Quantifying these emissions is a hard problem in both laboratory and field conditions. First, we must recognize the physicochemical properties of the PM that is emitted by various non-exhaust sources. In this paper, we underline the problem of information accessibility with regards to the properties and qualities of PM from non-exhaust sources. We also indicate why scarce information is available in order to find the possible solution to this ongoing issue...|$|E
40|$|When ore filled trains enter a dumping cycle after {{arriving}} at the ports, a compressor <b>brake</b> <b>car</b> (CB car) is attatched {{to the rear of}} the train to provide the compressed air and a dragging brake. The CB cars used by Rio Tinto at the Parker Point dumpers have been identified as the cause of high pitch squealing. As operations occur in such close proximity to Dampier residents, excessive noise is an issue that affects Rio Tinto’s social licence to operate within the local community. Since their introduction at the Parker Point dumpers, a variety of projects have aimed to reduce the noise created by the CB cars. This project will monitor and assess the noise levels produced by the CB cars, assess the effectiveness of prior modifications and to determine the most appropriate methods of noise reduction in the future. Initial results indicate that none of the current modifications have provided sufficient noise attenuation. Wheel temperature measurements suggest that noise damping technologies usually reserved for passenger rail could be applied to this heavy haul application. 1...|$|E
