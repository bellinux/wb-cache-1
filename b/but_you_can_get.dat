6000|$|... "He is {{a first-rate}} soldier," [...] the man said, [...] "and I expect {{he will get}} the first vacancy among the sergeants.

60|$|MRS HUSHABYE [as he goes]. It's no use. You'd really better-- [but Dunn has vanished]. We {{had better}} all {{go out and}} look for some tea.

5000|$|The band is {{completely}} instrumental and Ronald has commented on this, saying [...] "When you’re {{in a band}} and you’ve got a singer the focal point is there instantly.

[...] Although described as post-rock, Ronald {{is quick to point}} out that the association of this label with guitar heavy music is not as relevant to the band, who use a far wider range of instrumentation.|$|E
6000|$|... "The colonel {{believes}} that he knows their family, Skinner; but of course, that will not make any difference in regard to them.

5000|$|Band {{member and}} one of the song's writers, Ash, states that the song is very special to the band and [...] "it seems to connect with people quite deeply."

I think about someone I know when I sing it." [...] This is the last single with Natalie Bassingthwaighte.|$|E
50|$|Secondary education, {{which begins}} {{at the age of}} 12 and, as of 2008, is {{compulsory}} until the age of 18, is offered at several levels. The two programmes of general education that lead to higher education are HAVO (five years) and VWO (six years). Pupils are enrolled according to their ability, and although VWO is more rigorous, both HAVO and VWO can be characterised as selective types of secondary education. The HAVO diploma is the minimum requirement for admission to HBO <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> into the HBO when you achieved an MBO Diploma(universities of applied sciences). The VWO curriculum prepares pupils for university, and only the VWO diploma grants access to WO (research universities).|$|E
50|$|With some {{badly damaged}} devices it {{is a good}} idea to use a utility such as ddrescue to make a backup.

You may find that when using ddrescue you get read errors because the device is damaged <b>but</b> if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> the partitions readable with your copy then <b>you</b> <b>can</b> try using Mount (Unix) and retrieve the data from the copy.|$|R
