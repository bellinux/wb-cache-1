40|$|In this work, a {{cohesive}} zone model of fracture is employed to study debonding in plastically deforming Al/epoxy T-peel joints. In order {{to model the}} adhesion between the <b>bonded</b> <b>metal</b> <b>strips,</b> the Park-Paulino-Roesler (PPR) potential based cohesive model (J Mech Phys Solids, 2009; 57 : 891 - 908) is employed, and interface elements are implemented in a finite element com-mercial code. A study {{on the influence of}} the cohesive properties (i. e. cohesive strength, fracture energy, shape parameter and slope indicator) on the predicted peel-force versus displacement plots reveals that the numerical results are mostly sensitive to cohesive strength and fracture energy. In turn, these parameters are tuned until a match between experimental and simulated load displacement curves is achieved...|$|R

Potential reliability issues include loss of adhesion and delamination, chemical instability under current collection conditions (electromigration or corrosion), compatibility of material and application method with subsequent encapsulation steps.

40|$|Performance {{investigations}} of two equipments for the cooling of <b>metal</b> <b>strips</b> {{are presented in}} the paper. The so called "brush cooling equipment" enables heat transfer coefficients up to 150 W/m 2 K. The cooling intensity depends on adapted <b>strip</b> <b>winding</b> force. Partial roughening of the strip has to be considered as unwanted concomitant phenomenon. An optimum for high cooling performance and moderate roughening was detected. Heat transfer coefficients of up to 600 W/m 2 K are demonstrated with the "gaseous cooling equipment". The designed cooling drum ensures high gas pressure up to 100 mbar inside the contact zone of the <b>metal</b> <b>strip</b> and the drum. Partially evacuation prevents high gas pressure in the vacuum process chamber. The realized pressure separation of six orders of magnitude enables the combination of "gaseous cooling equipment" with high-rate sputtering or electron beam evaporation. The demonstrated heat transfer coefficients describe a distinctive performance incr ease compared to known state of the art. Extensions concerning deposition rate or deposition of thick layers onto thin metal foils get feasible. In future should be checked whether the new developed equipments can be adapted for the cooling of plastic films as well...|$|R

40|$|When a {{longitudinal}} spin-unpolarized charge current flows {{in a thin}} slab of nonmagnetic metal with strong spin-orbit coupling of conduction electrons, a transverse spin Hall {{voltage can be generated}} between both edges of the sample, and the spin Hall voltage can be detected by the measurement of an ordinary Hall voltage produced in a transverse <b>metal</b> <b>strip</b> which connects both edges of the sample. In this paper, we discuss the influences of spin transfer and contact resistances between the longitudinal sample and the transverse <b>metal</b> <b>strip</b> on the measurement of the spin Hall voltage. We show that, due to the spin transfer between the longitudinal sample and the transverse <b>metal</b> <b>strip,</b> the magnitude of the spin Hall voltage produced in the longitudinal sample and the magnitude of the ordinary Hall voltage produced in the transverse <b>metal</b> <b>strip</b> and the relation between them will all strongly depend on the contact resistances, thus in order to detect the spin Hall voltage correctly through the measurement of the ordinary Hall voltage, the influences of spin transfer and contact resistance need to be taken into account. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

When light injected to an HPWG is absorbed by the <b>metal</b> <b>strip,</b> the temperature increases and {{the resistance of the}} <b>metal</b> <b>strip</b> changes accordingly due to the photothermal and thermal resistance effects of the metal. Therefore, the optical power variation can be monitored by measuring the resistance of the <b>metal</b> <b>strip</b> on the HPWG. To obtain the electrical signal for the resistance measurement conveniently, a Wheatstone bridge circuit is monolithically integrated with the HPWG on the same chip. As the HPWG has nanoscale light confinement, the present power monitor is as short as ~ 3 μm, which is the smallest photothermal power monitor reported until now. The compactness helps to improve the thermal efficiency and the response speed. For the present power monitor fabricated with simple fabrication processes, the measured responsivity is as high as about 17. 7 mV/mW at a bias voltage of 2 V and the power dynamic range is as large as 35 dB...|$|R
