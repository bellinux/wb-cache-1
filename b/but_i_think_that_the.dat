500|$|Furthermore, in 2013 Michael Cragg of The Guardian {{pointed out}} that [...] "two decades after its release, the Icelandic artist's first album has never sounded more relevant." [...] He argued that Debut [...] "reconstructed pop music", also writing that [...] "while pop in 2013 looks {{back to the early}} 90s for inspiration, Björk's ability on Debut to {{innovate}} by using disparate genres without losing a sense of her own identity should be the blueprint for any new artist with desires to break the mould." [...] In the album's entry in their list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time" [...] —where the album was included at number 46—, NME claimed that [...] "Debut achieved the remarkable feat of turning an idiosyncratic vocalist from a feted cult band into a significant global pop star, without losing one iota of the experimental mindset and creative cool that made her so special." [...] In 2005, Björk stated that she thought the album wasn't as strong as her later efforts: [...] "It's hard to judge yourself but I don't think [...] my best. Debut was the album that went the highest up there in terms of what is 'Bjork music'. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> persona I created, which was entirely accidental, is better captured on the later albums".|$|E

She repeated that Littlejohn was framed and another man was a likely suspect, saying: [...] "He was a convenient scapegoat who has a long criminal record". [...] Afterward, David said: [...] "We're going to appeal. We're disappointed. I'm hoping this gives {{the family of the}} victim some closure. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wrong man was convicted." ...|$|E
2500|$|... : On 13 April, {{the embassy}} in Madrid {{stated that the}} U.S. sees the {{question}} of Catalan independence as an internal issue of Spain. On 26 September, President Donald Trump, during his meeting with Mariano Rajoy, said that [...] "Spain is a great country and it should remain united", but expressed his doubts on whether a referendum will be held, stating that [...] "I think that nobody knows if they are gonna have a vote. The President would {{say they are not}} going to have a vote. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people would be very much opposed to that." [...] Earlier that month, the State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert insisted in that the referendum is an internal affair of Spain and that the US [...] "will work with whatever government or entity that comes out of it".|$|E

"Really, Miss Fregelius," [...] he said, {{with some}} irritation, for the {{surroundings}} {{of the scene}} and his companion's talk were uncanny, [...] "do you think this an occasion to explore ruins and relate nightmares?"

60|$|Thirty {{years ago}} Edwin Booth played 'Hamlet' a hundred nights in New York. With {{three times the}} population, how often is 'Hamlet' played now in a year? If Booth were back now in his prime, how often could he play it in New York? Some will say twenty-five nights. I will say three hundred, and say it with confidence.

60|$|There must {{certainly}} {{be something in}} the atmosphere of a fish-market which tends to call forth the mental and physical energies of mankind, (perhaps I should rather say of womankind), and which calls forth a tremendous flow of abusive language. Billingsgate is notorious, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bergen fish-market beats it hollow. One or two phases of the national character are there displayed in perfection. It is the Billingsgate of Norway--the spot where Norse females are roused to a pitch of frenzy that is not equalled, I believe, in any other country.|$|E

60|$|I {{told you}} before that the holiest was called the oracle, not because in a strict sense the whole of it was so, but because such answer of God was there, as {{was not in the}} outward temple, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ark and mercy-seat were indeed more {{especially}} that called the oracle; 'for there I will meet with thee,' saith God, and from above that 'I will commune with thee' (Exo 25:22). When David said, 'I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle,' he meant not so much towards the holiest house, as toward the mercy-seat that was therein. Or, as he saith in the margin, 'Toward the oracle of thy sanctuary' (Psa 28:2).|$|E
60|$|I do {{not wish}} you to study it merely on account of those prophecies in it, which many wise and good men think foretell the dates of our Lord's first and second comings, and {{of the end of}} the world. I am not skilled, my friends, in that kind of wisdom. I cannot tell you what God will do hereafter. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> book of Daniel like the other prophets, tells us what God is always doing on earth, and so gives us certain and eternal rules by which we may {{understand}} strange and terrible events, wars, distress of nations, the fall of great men, and the suffering of innocent men, when we see them happen, as we may see any day--perhaps very soon indeed.|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> most wonderful, astounding, and {{altogether}} {{amazing story}} about arrow-shooting is {{told of the}} Indians who used to inhabit Florida. It is stated that these Indians were {{in the habit of}} assembling, in parties of ten or a dozen, for the purpose of having some amusement in archery. They would form themselves into a circle, and one of them throwing an ear of maize or Indian corn into the air, the rest would shoot at it and would shell it of every grain of corn before it fell to the ground. Sometimes, the arrows would strike it so hard and fast that it would remain suspended in the air for several minutes, and the cob never fell until the very last grain had been shot from it! ...|$|E
