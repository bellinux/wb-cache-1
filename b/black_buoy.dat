500|$|Farragut's {{plan for}} the battle was {{relatively}} simple.

60|$|In all the contractions and {{expansions}} of that inland sea, the Bay of San Francisco, {{there can}} be few drearier scenes than the Vallejo Ferry. Bald shores and a low, bald islet enclose the sea; through the narrows the tide bubbles, muddy like a river. When we made the passage (bound, although yet we knew it not, for Silverado) the steamer jumped, and the <b>black</b> <b>buoys</b> were dancing in the jabble; the ocean breeze blew killing chill; and, although the upper sky was still unflecked with vapour, the sea-fogs were pouring in from seaward, over the hilltops of Marin County, in one great, shapeless, silver cloud.|$|R
50|$|Killin' Time is the 1989 (see 1989 in music) {{debut album}} by American swing-country singer-songwriter Clint <b>Black.</b> The album, <b>buoyed</b> by the chart-topping success {{of its first}} four singles, was a huge hit upon its release, and {{established}} Black {{as one of the}} biggest new stars in country music. The album is currently certified triple platinum by the RIAA.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well then," [...] {{continued}} Firebrand, [...] "the exploding of the detonator and the {{dry disc}} causes the wet gun-cotton also to go off, {{as you have}} seen. Now {{they are going to}} exhibit one of the modes of defending harbours. They have sunk four mines, of 300 pounds of gunpowder each, not far from where you see yon black specks floating on the water. The <b>black</b> specks are <b>buoys,</b> called circuit-closers, because they contain a delicate contrivance--a compound of mechanism and galvanism--which, when the buoys are bumped, close the electric circuit and cause the mine to explode. Thus when a ship-of-war sails against one of these circuit-closers, she is immediately blown up." ...|$|R
500|$|Shortly after Tecumsehs arrival on 4 August, Rear Admiral David G. Farragut, the {{squadron}} commander, briefed his captains on {{his plan for}} the next day's battle. Manhattan and Tecumseh were to keep the ironclad ram Tennessee away from the vulnerable wooden ships while they were passing the fort and then sink her. The river monitors [...] and [...] were to engage Fort Morgan until all of the wooden ships had passed. The four monitors would form the starboard column of ships, closest to Fort Morgan, with Tecumseh in the lead, while the wooden ships formed a separate column to port.

6000|$|The heaving and <b>black</b> <b>buoy</b> in {{the near}} sea is one of Turner's [...] "echoes," [...] repeating, with slight change, {{the head of the}} sloop with its flash of luster. The chief aim of this buoy is, however, to give {{comparative}} lightness to the shadowed part of the sea, which is, indeed, somewhat overcharged in darkness, and would have been felt to be so, but for this contrasting mass. Hide it with the hand, and this will be immediately felt. There is only one other of Turner's works which, in its way, can be matched with this drawing, namely, the Mouth of the Humber in the River Scenery. The latter is, on the whole, the finer picture; but this by much the more interesting in the shipping.|$|E
60|$|A heavy {{atmosphere}} of oppressive quietude pervaded the ship. In the afternoon men went about washing clothes and hanging {{them out to}} dry in the unprosperous breeze with the meditative languor of disenchanted philosophers. Very little was said. The problem of life seemed too voluminous for the narrow limits of human speech, and by common consent it was abandoned to the great sea that had from the beginning enfolded it in its immense grip; to the sea that knew all, and would in time infallibly unveil to each the wisdom hidden in all the errors, the certitude that lurks in doubts, the realm of safety and peace beyond the frontiers of sorrow and fear. And in the confused current of impotent thoughts that set unceasingly {{this way and that}} through bodies of men, Jimmy bobbed up upon the surface, compelling attention, like a <b>black</b> <b>buoy</b> chained to the bottom of a muddy stream. Falsehood triumphed. It triumphed through doubt, through stupidity, through pity, through sentimentalism. We set ourselves to bolster it up from compassion, from recklessness, from a sense of fun. Jimmy's steadfastness to his untruthful attitude {{in the face of the}} inevitable truth had the proportions of a colossal enigma--of a manifestation grand and incomprehensible that at times inspired a wondering awe; and there was also, to many, something exquisitely droll in fooling him thus to the top of his bent. The latent egoism of tenderness to suffering appeared in the developing anxiety not to see him die. His obstinate non-recognition of the only certitude whose approach we could watch from day to day was as disquieting as the failure of some law of nature. He was so utterly wrong about himself that one could not but suspect him of having access to some source of supernatural knowledge. He was absurd to the point of inspiration. He was unique, and as fascinating as only something inhuman could be; he seemed to shout his denials already from beyond the awful border. He was becoming immaterial like an apparition; his cheekbones rose, the forehead slanted more; the face was all hollows, patches of shade; and the fleshless head resembled a disinterred black skull, fitted with two restless globes of silver in the sockets of eyes. He was demoralising. Through him we were becoming highly humanised, tender, complex, excessively decadent: we understood the subtlety of his fear, sympathised with all his repulsions, shrinkings, evasions, delusions--as though we had been over-civilised, and rotten, and without any knowledge of the meaning of life. We had the air of being initiated in some infamous mysteries; we had the profound grimaces of conspirators, exchanged meaning glances, significant short words. We were inexpressibly vile and very much pleased with ourselves. We lied to him with gravity, with emotion, with unction, as if performing some moral trick with a view to an eternal reward. We made a chorus of affirmation to his wildest assertions, as though he had been a millionaire, a politician, or a reformer--and we a crowd of ambitious lubbers. When we ventured to question his statements we did it after the manner of obsequious sycophants, to the end that his glory should be augmented by the flattery of our dissent. He influenced the moral tone of our world as though he had it in his power to distribute honours, treasures, or pain; and he could give us nothing but his contempt. It was immense; it seemed to grow gradually larger, as his body day by day shrank a little more, while we looked. It was the only thing about him--of him--that gave the impression of durability and vigour. It lived within him with an unquenchable life. It spoke through the eternal pout of his black lips; it looked at us through the impertinent mournfulness of his languid and enormous stare. We watched him intently. He seemed unwilling to move, as if distrustful of his own solidity. The slightest gesture must have disclosed to him (it could not surely be otherwise) his bodily weakness, and caused a pang of mental suffering. He was chary of movements. He lay stretched out, chin on blanket, in a kind of sly, cautious immobility. Only his eyes roamed over faces: his eyes disdainful, penetrating and sad.|$|E

50|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} is {{from modern}} times; they were granted on 22 August 1986. The arms show a <b>black</b> <b>buoy</b> on a gold background. The buoy {{is an appropriate}} symbol for a municipality since it is dependent on fishing and sailing.|$|E
50|$|Later lightships, for {{purposes}} of visibility, normally had bright red hulls which displayed {{the name of the}} station in white, upper-case letters; relief light vessels displayed the word RELIEF, instead. A few ships had differently coloured hulls. For example, the Huron Lightship was painted black since she was assigned the <b>black</b> <b>buoy</b> side of the entrance to the Lake Huron Cut. The lightvessel that operated at Minots Ledge, Cohasset, Mass. from 1854 until 1860 had a light yellow hull to make it visible against the blue-green seas and the green hills behind it.|$|E

50|$|The French {{chose to}} cross the bar just after sunset on 13 July. Their {{objective}} was to fight their way past the Siamese defenses but only if fired upon. The weather was overcast and raining. By this time the Siamese were on high alert and at battle stations. The French ships were towed into action by the small mail steamer Jean Baptiste Say. At 18:15 the rain stopped and the Siamese gunners observed the French ships passing the nearby lighthouse. A few minutes later, the French were off <b>Black</b> <b>Buoy</b> when they entered {{the range of the}} fort. Siamese gunners were ordered to fire three warning shots, if they were ignored, then a fourth would signal their gunboats to begin firing.|$|E
