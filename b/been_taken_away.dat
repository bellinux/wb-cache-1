5|$|The king, {{after getting}} {{suspicious}} of her actions, once {{followed her to}} a sadhu’s place, with a dagger in his cloak. Once he reached the ashram, he {{found that there was}} no one inside. To his surprise, both the sadhu and his daughter Champavati had vanished. When he was about to return, he heard a voice saying that his daughter had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> as a punishment of his suspicion. The voice also asked him to build a temple, on the name of his daughter Champavati, if he wanted to avoid further familial calamities.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Matt Smith) and {{his companions}} Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and her husband Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) crash land in 1938 Berlin when the TARDIS is hijacked by Amy and Rory's childhood friend, Mels (Nina Toussaint-White). They accidentally save Adolf Hitler (Albert Welling) who was scheduled for torture by the Teselecta, a time-travelling justice department. When shot by Hitler, Mels unexpectedly regenerates into River Song, the grown version of Amy and Rory's child who had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> from them. As River is a criminal herself due to her future execution of the Doctor, the Teselecta pursue her instead, whilst the Doctor faces death from her poisoned lipstick.|$|E
5|$|Regarding {{the aerial}} imagery that the U.S. report said {{suggested}} a lower death toll, the South Korean investigators, drawing on accounts from survivors and area residents, {{said that at}} least 62 bodies had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> by relatives, or buried in soldiers' abandoned foxholes, {{in the first days}} after the killings, and others remained inside one underpass tunnel, under thin layers of dirt, out of sight of airborne cameras, and awaiting later burial in mass graves. In addition, South Korean military specialists questioned the U.S. reconnaissance photos, pointing out irregularities, including the fact that the No Gun Ri frames had been spliced into the roll of film, raising the possibility that they were not, as claimed, from August 6, 1950, eight days after the killings.|$|E

50|$|The West Side Highway takes a small jog {{east from}} the piers to below West 42nd Street {{because when the}} {{terminal}} was built land had to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> from Manhattan to allow for longer piers. The US Army Corps of Engineers, who control the waterfront dimension, would not extend the pierhead line farther into the river, so the city extended the pier by cutting away at the land. The city earlier did this for the Chelsea Piers; however in Chelsea only landfill <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away.</b> At the Passenger Terminal, actual Manhattan schist <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{variation}} of this origin of Chamba {{is that it}} originated as a hermitage which Champavati, a devout Hindu, used to frequent. The king, being suspicious of his daughter's fidelity, one day investigated and followed her to the hermitage, but surprisingly he found neither his daughter nor the hermit there. Suddenly he {{was said to have}} heard a voice which informed him that his suspicions were ill-founded, admonishing him and informing him that his daughter had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> from him permanently as a punishment for his lack of trust in her morals. The King, fully chastened, sought redemption for his sin by expanding the hermitage into a temple, named in his daughter’s honour and built a city around the temple. Today this temple, called the Champavati Temple, belongs to the Royal family and the King’s daughter is venerated as a goddess. Every year, since 935, the Minjar festival or fair has been held. It lasts for 21 days, coinciding with the first day of Baisakhi.|$|E
5|$|While the {{division}} was never deployed overseas, its headquarters staff was deployed to Norway and briefly {{fought in the}} Norwegian Campaign. Afterwards, {{the division}} was deployed to Northern Ireland for almost three years {{as a result of}} rumours of a German intention to invade. In Northern Ireland, the division manned static defences, conducted internal security, and trained for future operations. Returning to England, the division participated in numerous military exercises and was scheduled to join the 21st Army Group for the Operation Overlord; the Allied invasion of German-occupied France. By late 1943, this role had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> from the division and it was assigned to train replacements for combat units. Throughout 1944, the division aided Overlord in various deception formats while most of the men were posted to combat formations within 21st Army Group. In late 1945, the division was re-organized as a light division and was going to be deployed to the Far East to fight Imperial Japan. The Japanese surrender resulted in the move not being made, and in November the division was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Sol and Naz {{spend the}} night {{together}} but at later dance rehearsals, Asher gives Naz her necklace back, and Sol sees this. He confronts Naz about it and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it meant nothing to her. Sol punches Asher, saying his brother has betrayed him, and a fight breaks out, but is broken up by Skolla and the other dancers. Skolla tells Sol and Asher they are both out {{of the group and}} reveals that Asher bought Sol's place. Sol goes back home to his mother but a neighbour tells him she has <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away.</b> Back in Walford, Naz insists she did not receive Sol's text message but he is still angry. Stevie attempts to get them to reconcile by locking them in the flat and pretending to swallow the key, but Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and Sol says she can stay there. Sol and Naz get close again but Asher interrupts them when he returns drunk. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and Sol thinks Naz was in on the plan so he tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. Asher finds Sol with their mother in hospital, and tells Sol he is better off with him than their mother as she is schizophrenic and has stabbed Asher. Sol says Asher is the problem and leaves. Asher finds him and apologises for Naz and says she did not get Sol's text message because he deleted it, and tells Sol that Naz loves him and he should do something about it. Sol returns to Walford again as Naz is leaving, and stops Ekin's car. Naz gets out and they kiss. Asher tells him he can dance at the dance-off, but when his name is called, he is unsure and calls for Asher, saying he needs him. Asher tells him he can do it on his own. Everyone cheers him after his routine and he is called one of the best dancers.|$|E

In November 1978, she left her camp under cover of night without permission, and returned to Ro Leap to see her mother and sister.

25|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, Latvia became once again an independent country. In this new nation, Livonians were finally recognised as an indigenous ethnic minority, whose language and culture must be protected and advanced. All rights and possessions which had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> from them during the Soviet era were now returned to them. For example, the old Livonian Community Centre in Mazirbe (Irē) was given back and transformed into a historical museum, called the House of the Livonian People. Also, the Livonian language was reintroduced in the elementary schools in Riga, Staicele, Ventspils, Dundaga and Kolka.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War {{it was the}} {{residence}} of the German military governor. After Poland regained her independence in 1918, the Castle became {{the residence}} of the President of Poland. It was lovingly restored {{under the guidance of}} Kazimierz Skórewicz (1920-1928) and Adolf Szyszko-Bohusz (until 1939). Under the terms of the Peace Treaty signed with Soviet Russia at Riga in 1920, works of art and other precious things, including all the castle furnishings, which had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> to Russia, were brought back to Poland. As a result, it was possible to restore the historic rooms to their appearance in the reign of Stanisław II Augustus.|$|E

25|$|In 1936, Hitler sent Charles Edward to Britain as {{president}} of the Anglo-German Friendship Society. His mission was to improve Anglo-German relations and to explore the possibility of a pact between the two countries. He attended the funeral of his first cousin George V in the uniform of a general of the German army (his British uniforms having <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> from him), and sent Hitler encouraging reports about the strength of pro-German sentiment among the British aristocracy. After the Abdication Crisis, he played host to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, the former King-Emperor and his wife, during their private tour of Germany in 1937.|$|E
25|$|From a {{relation}} of Pietro Demarchis, bishop of Santorini, who visited Istanbul in 1622, {{we know that}} {{at that time the}} columns of the church had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> by the Turks and substituted with wooden pillars, and that the dome was covered with frescoes. Moreover, part of the building was already menacing ruin. Just after the conversion to mosque, to the building were added a mihrab, a minbar and a minaret. After the fire of 1919, the building fell into ruin (the roof collapsed and the minaret crashed already in the 1820s), but luckily it was thoroughly studied and surveyed by the German Archaeologist Paul Schatzmann in 1934/1935.|$|E
25|$|It {{was only}} when the FCC {{returned}} an hour to the networks on Sundays (for news or family programming), which had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> from them four years earlier, in a 1975 amendment to the Access Rule, that CBS finally found a viable permanent timeslot for 60 Minutes. When a family-oriented drama, Three for the Road, ended after a 12-week run in the fall, the newsmagazine took its place at 7:00p.m. Eastern Time (6:00 Central) on December 7. It has aired at that time since, for 42 years , making 60 Minutes not only the longest-running prime time program currently in production, but also the television program (excluding daily programs such as evening newscasts or morning news-talk shows) broadcasting for the longest length of time at a single time period each week in U.S. television history.|$|E

25|$|The typhoon {{shelter of}} Causeway Bay and the Tin Hau Temple {{reveal that the}} area was once a fishing village. Before urban {{development}} and massive land reclamation, Causeway Bay was a heavily silted bay. Its former shape {{can be found on}} maps by tracing Tung Lo Wan Road, which goes along the former bay. In the early stage of development a causeway was built, which is the present-day Causeway Road. In the 1950s, the coastline was further pushed forward when the remains of the bay was reclaimed for the Victoria Park, when the statue of Queen Victoria was brought back from Japan. The statue had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> during the Second World War from Statue Square at Chater Road, Central. Kellett Island off the coast of Causeway Bay has disappeared and connected {{as a result of the}} land reclamation.|$|E
500|$|Smith bore his {{imprisonment}} stoically. Understanding that he {{was effectively}} on trial before his own people, many of whom considered him a fallen prophet, he wrote a personal defense and an apology for {{the activities of the}} Danites. [...] "The keys of the kingdom," [...] he wrote, [...] "have not <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> from us". Though he directed his followers to collect and publish their stories of persecution, he also urged them to moderate their antagonism toward non-Mormons. On April 6, 1839, after a grand jury hearing in Davis County, Smith and his companions escaped custody, almost certainly with the connivance of the sheriff and guards.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} as coach, Le Goff had {{complete}} control over the US eventing team including selection, training and pairing of horses and riders.

[...] Although this power has since <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> from the US eventing coach and a more objective selection system put in its place, Le Goff's abilities in this area took the US teams to numerous medals while he was coach. In his position as American coach, USET historian Jennifer Bryant called him [...] "one of the greatest coaches in three-day-eventing history", as he built a multiple-medal-winning team from previously unknown horses and riders.|$|E
