25|$|Much of Hitchcock's {{supposed}} {{dislike of}} actors has been exaggerated. Hitchcock {{simply did not}} tolerate the method approach, as he believed that actors should only concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters. In a Sight & Sound interview, he stated that, 'the method actor is OK in the theatre {{because he has a}} free space to move about. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> cutting the face and what he sees and so forth, there must be some discipline'. He often used the same actors in many of his films.|$|E
25|$|Karl Giberson {{argues that}} when {{discussing}} compatibility, some scientific intellectuals often ignore the viewpoints of intellectual leaders in theology and instead argue against less informed masses, thereby, defining religion by non intellectuals and slanting the debate unjustly. He argues that leaders in science sometimes trump older scientific baggage and that leaders in theology do the same, so once theological intellectuals {{are taken into}} account, people who represent extreme positions like Ken Ham and Eugenie Scott will become irrelevant. Cynthia Tolman notes that religion {{does not have a}} method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> Christian theology and ultimate truths, she notes that people often rely on scripture, tradition, reason, and experience to test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe.|$|E
25|$|Black bears also {{fish the}} salmon. Black bears usually operate during the day, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> salmon {{they tend to}} fish at night. This is partly to avoid {{competition}} with the more powerful brown bears, {{but it is also}} because they catch more salmon at night. During the day, salmon are very evasive and attuned to visual clues, but at night they focus on their spawning activities, generating acoustic clues the bears tune into. Black bears may also fish for salmon during the night because their black fur is easily spotted by salmon in the daytime. In 2009, researchers compared the foraging success of black bears with the white-coated spirit bear, a morphed subspecies of the black bear. They found the spirit bear had no more success catching salmon at night time, but had greater success than the black bears during the day.|$|E

Roxy wants to meet her but Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), Tommy's stepfather, who Roxy is now engaged to, protests. Kat goes instead and brings Ronnie back to Albert Square. Alfie insists Ronnie keep her distance, when he finds the sisters reminiscing with Tommy, nearby. As a result, Roxy cuts ties with Ronnie and spends time healing things with Alfie, away from the Square. During this time, Ronnie reconciles with Jack, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> going public, Jack cannot do it and decides to leave Walford. Ronnie's cousin, Phil, puts Ronnie in charge of his businesses, while he recovers from a car accident. She makes an enemy in Carl White (Daniel Coonan), when he attempts to muscle in on the businesses. When Roxy returns to the Square, she and Ronnie make peace but Ronnie becomes suspicious about Alfie's feelings for Kat. She is proved right when he leaves Roxy just after their wedding ceremony. Roxy then starts dating Carl and when Ronnie fails to pull her back together, she convinces Phil to sell The Queen Vic, the pub that Kat and Alfie lease from him, to force them out of Walford. However, Roxy continues to see Carl and Ronnie decides to take Roxy and Amy to Ibiza. When Carl learns about this, he threatens to rape Ronnie and, when he attacks her, she kills him in self-defence by slamming the boot of the car onto his head. She and Roxy then leave for Ibiza, after disposing {{of the body and}} only Phil is aware of her actions.|$|E
500|$|Yuri on Ice {{differs from}} other anime {{covering}} same-sex relationships, such as yaoi and yuri. Carli Velocci of Geek.com wrote, [...] "Their relationship exists somewhere beyond any sexuality, meaning it doesn't {{fall into the}} same traps {{that a lot of}} yuri and yaoi relationships do ... While this isn't the first anime with a same-sex couple at the forefront, it's {{one of the first to}} present a story that isn't strictly sexual and is mutual. Yuri and Victor complement each other, but both also admit that they've grown as people because of the presence of the other. The equality in their relationship is revolutionary, even if it wasn't the first to depict one. You can assign the [...] "seme" [...] or [...] "uke" [...] label to Victor and Yuri, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> their psychological bond, it's more equal ...

Incredulous, the family can do nothing while the lawyer is present, especially when Schicchi slyly reminds them of the penalties that discovery of the ruse will bring. Their outburst of rage when the notary leaves is countered by a love duet from Lauretta and Rinuccio, [...] "Lauretta mia"; there is now no bar to their marriage, since Schicchi can provide a full dowry. Schicchi chases the relatives out of what is now his house, and when he returns stands moved {{at the sight of the}} two lovers. He turns to the audience and asks them to agree that no better use could be found for Buoso's wealth. Although the poet Dante has condemned him to hell for this trick, Schicchi asks the audience to forgive him in light of [...] "extenuating circumstances." ...|$|E

[...] He continued, [...] "I love dipping into ... some of that material of Howard Hughes, which I'm sure he's kind of been likened to", and described his biggest challenge in playing the character as [...] "keeping it very realistic, but at the same time, tongue-in-cheek as well", and not making Stark [...] "too broad". On Carter and Stark's relationship moving into the second season, Atwell said, [...] "there’s a new comfort level between Stark and Peggy ... they’re on a bit more of an even level. She respects him hugely, but is also not afraid to comment on his lifestyle choices and how disgustingly misogynistic she finds him ... he does use women as a form of escapism for him and his Dionysian ways, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> Peggy, he doesn’t see her as big boobs and red lips. He sees her as someone he can actually have a proper conversation with. Which probably scares the hell out of him".|$|E
500|$|When [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} in late 2002, critics and the public had speculated that Beyoncé and Jay-Z were having a mutual affair. Despite widespread rumors, they remained silent about their relationship. According to critics, the title itself of the album sounded [...] "more intriguing" [...] with Beyoncé singing personal songs. Though love is the theme Beyoncé had incorporated in the album, [...] "most the material is vague enough to be about any relationship"; however, there are songs that suggested affirmation of their relationship. In the song [...] "Signs", Beyoncé sings about being {{in love with a}} Sagittarius, [...] which coincidentally is Jay-Z's zodiac sign. In response to the persistent rumors about them, Beyoncé stated, [...] "People can come to whatever conclusion they like... That's the beauty of music... I'm a singer, I'll talk about writing songs all you want. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> certain personal things any normal person wouldn't tell people they don't know, I just feel like I don't have to [...]" ...|$|E

Aswad said the songs feature [...] "mellifluous melodies". Laura Sinagra of Rolling Stone found Usher's singing a [...] "sweet falsetto on the weepy breakup song [...] ", adding, it [...] "convincingly marries resolve and regret, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> rough stuff, there's still no 'u' in p-i-m-p." [...] Cibula called the song brilliant and considers its step one and step two technique a hit. Jon Caramanica of Blender complimented the song for being the only [...] "serviceable" [...] track among all ballad-influenced songs in the album which [...] "often drown in their own inanity." [...] Ande Kellman of Allmusic considered [...] "Burn" [...] as one of the Usher's best moments in the album, together with [...] "Caught Up", the final single from Confessions.

500|$|Merton Council {{had been}} recommending that Wimbledon {{move to a}} site in nearby Beddington, but this {{proposal}} fell through soon after the move to Selhurst Park. With the inflation in costs {{brought on by the}} foundation of the FA Premier League in 1992, the club soon began to lose money heavily. Rumours that the groundshare would eventually result in the Dons and the Eagles merging led Hammam to say [...] "I’d rather die and have vultures eat my insides than merge with Crystal Palace". In 1992 the Greyhound Racing Association offered to redevelop Wimbledon Stadium (less than a mile from Plough Lane) into a 15,000-seater dog racing and football ground. Hammam was outraged two years later when the council, attempting to retain the Plough Lane site for public use, refused to sanction its sale for a supermarket redevelopment that Hammam said would finance a new ground at the dog racing site. Hammam angrily declared he would look elsewhere, and threatened to change the club's name and remove the double-headed eagle device, a symbol of Wimbledon Borough, from the team's badge. [...] "We have been betrayed," [...] he told the press. [...] "The council say they want us back, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> taking action they don't want to know." ...|$|E
500|$|Thompson has {{heavily criticized}} {{a number of}} video games and campaigned against their {{producers}} and distributors. His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as [...] "murder simulators" [...] to rehearse violent plans. He has pointed to alleged connections between such games {{and a number of}} school massacres. According to Thompson, [...] "In every school shooting, we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers." [...] Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and copycat behavior. According to Thompson, [...] "If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing , one has to wonder why he doesn't get a life, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain." [...] Thompson has described the proliferation of games by Sony, a Japanese company, as [...] "Pearl Harbor 2". According to Thompson, [...] "Many parents think that stores won’t sell an M-rated game to someone under 17. We know that's not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked." ...|$|E

[...] Similarly considering [...] "1+1" [...] to be [...] "the perfect opener" [...] of 4, Joanne Dorken of MTV UK wrote that it exposes a more vulnerable side of Beyoncé and that it will remain [...] "a classic stripped-back slow jam from the diva." [...] Praising Beyoncé's vocals, Jon Caramainca of The New York Times stated that [...] " [...] requires a vocal muscle few singers possess, and even fewer would care to deploy." [...] Writing for The Baltimore Sun, Wesley Case included [...] "1+1" [...] in his list of Five Great Songs and praised song's concept, writing that he began crying when he heard the album version and called it [...] "gut-wrenching" [...] and [...] "gorgeous". Case appreciated Beyoncé's sensitivity and concluded that it [...] "fades to black like an ellipsis and it's so damn beautiful." ...|$|E
