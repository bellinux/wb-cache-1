5|$|Robson {{defeated}} bowel {{cancer in}} 1992, a malignant melanoma in 1995, and a tumour {{in his right}} lung and a <b>brain</b> <b>tumour,</b> both in 2006. Treatment of these conditions had left him partially paralysed due to a stroke caused by the <b>brain</b> <b>tumour,</b> and also with a partially prosthetic upper jaw after the melanoma was surgically removed. His fifth diagnosis of cancer in 2007, consisting of cancerous nodules in both lungs, was diagnosed as terminal in February 2007, and as of December 2008, was being controlled through bouts of chemotherapy. After these experiences, and following his fifth diagnosis with cancer, Robson devoted the remaining {{years of his life}} to helping fight the disease. On 25 March 2008, he launched the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. By November 2008, the Foundation had raised £1million. The money raised by the Foundation funded equipment for the Sir Bobby Robson Cancer Trials Research Centre, in the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne, and would go on to fund other cancer projects in the North East of England.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that intrinsic <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> originate from a neural stem/progenitor cell population in the subventricular zone of the post-natal brain. However, the influence of the initial genetic mutation on the phenotype as well as the contribution of mature astrocytes to the formation of <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> is still not understood. We deleted Rb/p 53, Rb/p 53 /PTEN or PTEN/p 53 in adult subventricular stem cells; in ectopically neurografted stem cells; in mature parenchymal astrocytes and in transplanted astrocytes. We found that only stem cells, but not astrocytes, gave rise to <b>brain</b> <b>tumours,</b> independent of their location. This suggests a cell autonomous mechanism that enables stem cells to generate <b>brain</b> <b>tumours,</b> whereas mature astrocytes do not form <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> in adults. Recombination of PTEN/p 53 gave rise to gliomas whereas deletion of Rb/p 53 or Rb/p 53 /PTEN generated primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET), indicating an important role of an initial Rb loss in driving the PNET phenotype. Our study underlines an important role of stem cells and the relevance of initial genetic mutations in the pathogenesis and phenotype of <b>brain</b> <b>tumours...</b>|$|R

While research has been focused mainly on non-neuronal cancers – for example, breast, lung and more recently pancreas and skin – tumours arising in the central nervous system, in particular in the brain, have not been studied at the NICB until recently. Malignant <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> are one of the most virulent forms of cancer. They can result in serious physical and cognitive impairments. <b>Brain</b> <b>tumours</b> are often described as cancer of the soul, since the brain is the centre of thought, personality and emotion. <b>Brain</b> <b>tumours</b> are cate-gorised into primary and secondary. Primary <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> originate in the brain and rarely spread outside the <b>brain,</b> whereas secondary <b>tumours</b> start outside the brain, for example in the lung, breast or skin, and metastasize to the <b>brain.</b> Primary <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> Primary <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> develop from <b>brain</b> cells and give rise to gliomas, menin-giomas, central nervous system lymphomas, medulloblastomas, and tumours of the nerve sheet.

40|$|Abstract <b>Brain</b> <b>tumours</b> are {{the second}} commonest form of {{childhood}} malignancy. In Hong Kong, around 25 to 40 children below 15 years are diagnosed to have {{various types of}} <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> each year. But the term "brain tumour " in fact includes a heterogeneous group of tumours and their classification, diagnostic criteria, treatment modalities and outcome have undergone {{major changes in the}} past 2 decades. In this review, the objectives are to provide brief and update information on various developments in these areas. These will include: 1) the recent consensus in the classification of childhood brain tumours; 2) the current epidemiology of children with <b>brain</b> <b>tumours,</b> both locally and aboard; 3) the current hypotheses on the pathogenesis of some common paediatric brain tumours; 4) the common presenting features of the commonest types of childhood <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> locally; 5) the current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches and lastly; 6) the commonly encountered long-term sequalae among paediatric <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> survivors. In summary, many common forms of childhood <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> found locally can be cured nowadays. Current challenge is to further improve the outcome in those with poor outcome and minimise therapy related toxicity in those with good prognosis.

40|$|Primary <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> {{are rare}} tumours which occur across all ages. In children, however, they are {{especially}} frequent; {{in this age}} cohort, they constitute {{the second most common}} tu-mours following leukaemias and are {{the most common cause of}} cancer-related death [1, 2]. Primary <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> com-prise a large spectrum of different tumour entities, each being associated with a distinct biological background and disease course [3]. Thus, the prognosis of the individual patient varies considerably by tumour type, age at diagnosis, and neurologi-cal impairment.

40|$|The four GPI-anchored cell {{adhesion}} molecules that exemplify the IgLON family are most highly {{expressed in the}} nervous system and associate to form up to six different heterodimeric ‘Diglons’ that can modify {{cell adhesion}} and inhibit axon migration. Recently, two members, OPCML and LSAMP, were identified as putative tumour suppressor genes in ovarian and renal carcinomas respectively. In this study, we investigated OPCML expression in nonneoplastic brain tissue and 35 <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> (18 glioblastoma multiformes, five anaplastic gliomas, five meningiomas, six metastases and one medulloblastoma) and four glioma cell lines using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). OPCML was highly expressed in cerebellum, less so in cerebral cortex, frontal lobe and meninges and was significantly reduced or absent in 83 % of <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> and all cell lines compared with nonneoplastic whole brain. Two OPCML splice variants {{have been identified in}} humans, termed α 1 and α 2, but the latter has not been demonstrated in human neural tissues. Using PCR with specific primers, nonneoplastic brain and 3 / 6 of tested <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> expressed both splice variants, whereas the remaining <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> only expressed the α 2 variant. Hypermethylation of the α 1 OPCML promoter, associated with down-regulation of expression in ovarian tumours, did not correlate with expression levels in the subset of <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> tested, implying transcription of OPCML from an alternative promoter or a different mechanism of down-regulation.

Abi drunkenly confesses to Lauren about her one-night stand with Lee, so she urges Abi {{to confess to}} Whitney, as Whitney has caught chlamydia from Lee. Abi does so but this results in much resentment. Babe emotionally blackmails Abi, forcing her to resign. Abi exposes Babe's secrets to the pub's landlord, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) with Whitney defending her, so he tells Abi that she can keep her job, but this causes tension when she is later threatened by Babe. However Abi struggles to work on her own and so Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) is forced to ask Babe back to help her. Abi then persistently bickers about an order and lack of hygiene so blames it on Babe. Angry with Abi's behaviour, Linda sacks her. Abi locks Babe in the kitchen freezer room {{as an act of}} revenge, although Babe frames her sister Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) who she strongly dislikes and has Alzheimer's disease. Abi is then reinstated at the Vic by a seemingly apologetic Babe but her behaviour, when alone in the kitchen with Abi, is threatening. Babe later leaves Walford after being thrown out by her family, so Abi runs the kitchen alone. Abi forms a friendship with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) when she moves in with Ben and Jay, and Donna convinces Abi to move in as well, though she feels bad about leaving Dot on her own, but Dot gives her blessing when Donna reveals that Abi wants to move out. Abi is inwardly resentful of Lauren's success and, following Lauren's secret abortion of which Abi was made aware, Abi tells Lauren's partner, Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) that they would make a good couple during a heart-to-heart, but he tells her she is too young to be a mother. On Father's Day, feeling second best to Lauren and wound up during an argument with Steven, Abi reveals the abortion. Lauren is jealous when her boss, Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre), flirts with Abi, which leads to an argument, with Abi throwing a drink over her sister and then evicting her from the party. Later, the tension simmering between Abi and Steven leads to them having sex, even though he warns her it will mean nothing. Abi and Steven continue an affair and Abi learns that Steven is lying about having a <b>brain</b> <b>tumour</b> so that Lauren will not leave him. Despite being against the idea, Abi does not tell Lauren as Steven promises Abi he is planning to leave Lauren to be with her. Then Abi is stunned by Steven's public marriage proposal to Lauren.

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is widely used}} both in the clinic and as a research tool {{in the management of}} <b>brain</b> <b>tumours.</b> While most studies focus on adult tumours, which have a higher incidence than those in children, paediatric <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> differ widely in terms of biology and treatment management. Furthermore, as a non-invasive and non-ionising imaging tool, MRI is used in the diagnosis, prognosis and assessment of treatment response of such tumours. This work focuses on diffusion MRI to study childhood <b>brain</b> <b>tumours.</b> The thesis is divided into three main parts: a reproducibility study of diffusion MRI parameters in order to answer the question of whether clinical imaging may be used interchangeably across multiple-centres to combine data from different institutions; a study on a tumour border diffusion measure as a prognostic biomarker in children with embryonal <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> – the apparent transient coefficient in tumour (ATCT); and a study analysing the functional diffusion map (fDM) as a tool for assessing treatment response in paediatric <b>brain</b> <b>tumours.</b> Diffusion MRI has been shown to have a good reproducibility and thus data from multiple centres and scanners can be combined in order to analyse clinical data for patients treated at different institutions; particularly where data for specific tumour types would otherwise be limited. In addition, ATCT {{has been shown to be}} a useful prognostic biomarker in children with embryonal <b>brain</b> <b>tumours.</b> Finally, while the fDM may be beneficial in assessing treatment response, the underlying biology of both tumour and healthy tissue needs to be carefully considered, and in particular, areas of necrosis, tumour grade and change in tumour size need to be taken into account.
