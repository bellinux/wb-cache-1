They ended 2004 by playing at the Hogmanay Party, held annually on 31 December. The band did a one-off show in Amsterdam which was the original show at [...] "The Melkweg", which got re-scheduled. This show became their first in 2005. It was also made available as a free webcast.|$|R

The comic focuses on the adventure-filled life of an idiot who wears a cape for no {{apparent}} reason (Chris), his perpetually angry teenage brother (Bobby), a sentient board (<b>Boardy),</b> and their friends. The Sunday comic usually focuses on the fantastical imaginations of Chris's pets, Giz (a dog) and Mask (a cat).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Developing a {{pultrusion}} {{process for}} fabricating composites using a graphite reinforced high-performance thermoplastic presents a technological {{challenge to the}} pultruder. Unlike conventional pultrusion of thermosets containing monomeric reactants and solvents which react in the pultrusion die causing polymerization, high-performance thermoplastic polymers either do not contain solvents or contain solvents which must be removed before polymerizing. In either case, consolidation is performed with rigid or <b>boardy</b> prepreg. In pultruding with conventional thermosetting polymers, fiber wetting and consolidation are performed at very low resin viscosities, which range from 500 to 1000 centipoises. In pultruding with high-performance thermoplastics, the die system must perform consolidation with polymers having viscosities as high as 1, 000, 000 centi-poises or higher. Die temperatures in thermosetting pultrusion range from 149 to 204 &deg;C (300 to 400 &deg;F), whereas in thermoplastic pultrusion the die system may approach 427 &deg;C (800 &deg;F). Engineering is critical in any attempt to design a system capable of pultruding high-temperature, high-performance thermoplastics. This paper presents a methodical approach in developing a pultrusion process for polyetherimide which can also be adapted to other high-performance thermoplastics. Resin characterization and methods of testing thermoplastic pultrusions are discussed. The effective use of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), ultrasonic C-scanning, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), conventional press molding, and material properties evaluation tests in thermoplastic pultrusion development is described...|$|E
40|$|As high {{performance}} thermoplastic composites evolve as {{primary and secondary}} air-craft structural materials, there exists a need to offer to the community a material form that greatly broadens the selection of thermoplastic matrix materials. As {{one looks at the}} choices of thermoplastic prepregs available on the market today, an evaluation must be given to {{the pros and cons of}} that individual material. Today, hot-melt prepregs result in a stiff, <b>boardy</b> form with no tack. This form severely limits the handleability in layup on complex contour tooling. If one attempts to offer tacky and drapeable prepreg, it is often at the expense of lengthy processing that allows solvent removal without void formation. In the case of those materials that exhibit some reactivity, such as pseudothermoplastics, the incorporation of a solvent to this point has been unavoidable. The other major issue surrounding pseudothermoplastics often concerns the evolution of reaction by-products that must be managed usually by a time consuming and delicate process cycle. The ability to offer thermoplastic prepregs that are drapeable and tacky, yet incorporate a wide range of thermoplastic and pseudothermoplastic matrix materials on a reinforce-ment of choice with no evolution of reaction by-products or solvents would greatly in-crease the choices of matrix material and at the same time offer improved processing in a cost effective manner. BASF has recently demonstrated this capability using a newly developed powder impregnation technology and is currently rapidly developing this tech-nology as a commercial process. 1...|$|E
