50|$|<b>Barrage</b> <b>jamming</b> is radio jamming {{accomplished}} by transmitting {{a band of}} frequencies that is large {{with respect to the}} bandwidth of a single emitter. <b>Barrage</b> <b>jamming</b> may be {{accomplished by}} presetting multiple jammers on adjacent frequencies, by using a single wideband transmitter, or by using a transmitter capable of frequency sweep fast enough to appear radiating simultaneously over wide band (e.g. a carcinotron). <b>Barrage</b> <b>jamming</b> makes it possible to jam emitters on different frequencies simultaneously and reduces the need for operator assistance or complex control equipment. These advantages are gained at the expense of reduced jamming power at any given frequency. <b>Barrage</b> <b>jamming</b> has to be used against frequency-agile radars, which change frequencies too quickly to follow them in a conventional way. The use of <b>barrage</b> <b>jamming</b> may also affect the communications capability of the jamming source in a negative fashion.|$|E

50|$|<b>Barrage</b> <b>jamming</b> is the jamming of {{multiple}} frequencies at once {{by a single}} jammer.

The dramatic fall in 330th BG losses to zero in July and August 1945 was due, no doubt, to luck, but also to the work of this section. The RCM participated in all BG missions from 4 May 1945 till 15 August 1945. They searched for Japanese radar, spot jammed individual Japanese radar units and <b>barrage</b> <b>jammed</b> target areas with specially equipped B-29s called [...] "Porcupines". Locating Japanese radar required specialized electronic equipment which was installed in these aircraft. The equipment included; a) a tuner-analyzer to measure the radar frequencies and strength and presumably the pulse width and pulse repetition frequency and b) four to five transmitters producing static noise, in effect drowning out Japanese radar signals.|$|R

First, we examine binary modulation systems with multiple-input, single-output (MISO) configurations. Later, we study MISO systems for complex spreading modulation systems in general. We demonstrate the performances of specific and widely used modulation schemes such as quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), 16 -quadrature amplitude modulation (16 -QAM) and 64 -quadrature amplitude modulation (64 -QAM). We also investigate the performances of the previous systems for multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) configurations for various combinations of transmit and receive antennas. In all systems, we apply maximal ratio combining (MRC) {{in order to obtain}} the maximum signal-to-noise ratio for MIMO systems. Finally, for all the different systems and configurations, we evaluate their performances for a Rayleigh fading channel and in the presence of different types of <b>jamming</b> (<b>barrage</b> noise <b>jamming,</b> pulsed-jamming and tone jamming).

50|$|There were 42 RCM {{missions}} {{starting on}} 4 May 1945, which included 35 regular BG missions; two missions {{to assist the}} 315th BW, which had no RCM capability, and five special radar signal search missions. During this period, 440 enemy radar signals were observed and analyzed and this information was forwarded to higher echelons for collation with information from other sources. On the regular BG missions, the RCM observer would spot or <b>barrage</b> <b>jam</b> the detected Japanese signals but, since the aircraft {{would be in the}} area for only 10 to 15 minutes, it was not effective during the entire time that the group was over the target. The Group had six Porcupine aircraft and more were being added when the war ended. These B-29s were dedicated mainly to analyzing and jamming Japanese radar signals. They were used over targets with heavy concentrations of gun-laying and searchlight-controlling radar. They would stay in the target area during the entire bombing period. RCM activities were very effective based on numerous crew reports of searchlights frantically searching the sky with little degree of accuracy when there was partial undercast cloud cover. At times of completely undercast skies, the anti-aircraft fire was totally inaccurate when radar jamming was employed. Over Shimonoseki, with over 200 anti-aircraft guns, a Porcupine was in the area and no Group planes were lost. The 315th BW planes, employing the AN/APQ-7 Eagle radar, had a 70 nmi km long bomb run lasting 15 minutes, ideal for gun-laying radar. But at the heavily defended Kawasaki oil refinery no B-29's were lost due to the effects of the Porcupine jammers.|$|R

This thesis evaluates the performance of different <b>jamming</b> strategies as <b>barrage</b> noise <b>jamming,</b> partial band jamming and multitone band jamming against an uncoded noncoherent FFH/MFSK system with a conventional receiver. The theoretical and simulated results showed that the best jamming strategies for the examined modulation orders M= 2, 4, 8 is the optimum case of multitone band jamming. As a second goal, this thesis also provides a preliminary analysis for an uncoded noncoherent FFH/MFSK system in a Rayleigh fading channel. This analysis includes the theoretical and simulated results for the influence in the performance from a barrage noise jammer along with AWGN. The results of the theoretical analysis and the simulation modeling for both cases can be used as guidelines to analyze more complicated jamming or combinations of jamming strategies against FFH/MFSK communication system.

The signal {{is subject to}} pulsednoise jamming, when either the desired signal alone or the desired signal and the jamming signal are subject to Nakagami fading. As expected, the implementation of forward error correction (FEC) coding with soft decision decoding (SDD) and maximumlikelihood detection improves performance as compared to uncoded signals. In addition, the combination of maximum-likelihood detection and error correction coding renders pulsed-noise jamming ineffective as compared to <b>barrage</b> noise <b>jamming.</b> When the jamming signal encounters fading as well, {{we assume that the}} average jamming power is much greater than the AWGN power. For uncoded signals, a jamming signal that experiences fading actually improves performance when the parameter of the information signal s m is {{less than or equal to}} one. Surprisingly, for larger values of s m a jamming signal that experiences fading works in favor of the information signal only for small signal-tointerference ratio (SIR). When SIR is large, performance when the jamming signal experiences fading is worse relative to performance when the jamming signal does not experience fading. For error correction coding with SDD, we investigate only continuous jamming since it is by far the worst-case. Moreover, while we consider a range of fading conditions for the jamming signal, we examine only Rayleigh fading of the information signal. The coded signal, when the jamming signal experiences severe fading, performs better relative to the case when the jamming signal does not experience fading.

5000|$|On BG {{missions}} from 4 to 25 May 1945, {{radar signal}} analyzers were carried, but no radar jamming was permitted. Only [...] "chaff" [...] was used during this period. Due to {{the concentration of}} gun-laying radar around Tokyo, jamming was requested but it was denied. The 20th Air Force lost {{the largest number of}} B-29s over Tokyo on 25-26 May 1945. On all subsequent missions, either spot jamming or <b>barrage</b> <b>jamming</b> of enemy radar signals was done. The [...] "chaff" [...] consisted of spools of foil packaged in breakout containers and each spool gave the impression on enemy radar of a B-29. B-29 gunners stated that searchlight beams sometimes followed the chaff as it floated down.

30|$|Radar jamming {{technology}} is {{in high demand}} because it is indispensable for counteracting the pulse compression gain of the victim radars. As a result, the radar parameters and the environment are often idealized {{during the process of}} jamming research. In fact, it is inevitable that there is an uncertainty in the radar position, which is obtained through electronic reconnaissance. The number of false targets entering the reference window of the CFAR detector is greatly reduced when there are inaccuracies in the radar position. At this time, the significant disadvantage of jamming generated by a single jammer is revealed. Existing ECMs are mostly classified into <b>barrage</b> <b>jamming</b> and deception jamming. Noise <b>barrage</b> <b>jamming</b> is not sensitive to the radar’s uncertain position, but it is difficult for noise <b>barrage</b> <b>jamming</b> generated by a single jammer to obtain an effective pulse compression gain in the pulse compression radar [11]. Additionally, it is necessary to add the number of the jammers to increase the power of noise <b>barrage</b> <b>jamming.</b> Coherent deception jamming based on DRFM can achieve a high pulse compression gain [12], but it is sensitive to the radar’s uncertain position. According to the law of conservation of energy, simply increasing the number of false targets with a single jammer will cause a decrease in the jamming power. To increase the number of false targets, cooperative jamming generated by multiple jammers is required.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Barrage and {{deceptive}} jamming can {{mask the}} {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) signals and render SAR useless.

After range compression, the <b>barrage</b> <b>jamming</b> has a noise-like characteristic while the real echo and deceptive jamming are focused. According to this, the <b>barrage</b> <b>jamming</b> is removed via a minimum entropy algorithm. Based on the different polarization characteristics between deceptive jamming and the real echo, the deceptive jamming can be suppressed by phase compensation in doppler domain. Simulation results are shown {{to demonstrate the validity}} of the proposed method. 1...|$|E

In addition, it is seen that ISRJ can induce false targets or <b>barrage</b> <b>jamming,</b> especially the preposition false target, which would greatly complicate the target detection and recognition of radar system.|$|E
30|$|Jamming {{attacks are}} one of the main types of {{security}} attack that mobility networks face. This threat is inherent to the actual wireless technology employed in this type of network, and in its most basic implementation (<b>barrage</b> <b>jamming),</b> there is no means to prevent an attacker from broadcasting a high power interfering signal on a commercial frequency band.|$|E
40|$|Noise, uniformaly {{distributed}} in amplitude and in frequency of level crossings, {{can be generated}} by nonlinear processing of Gaussian noise.

30|$|Finally, the {{sequence}} id could be broadcasted repeatedly in a frequency hopping scheme {{over the entire}} system bandwidth. Although this would require substantial changes to the LTE standards, it would force an attacker to jam the entire band to jam the id broadcasting operation. Therefore, the goal of counteracting the advantage a jammer has in LTE networks would be achieved as the only feasible option would be <b>barrage</b> <b>jamming.</b>|$|E
30|$|It {{has been}} shown that a {{standard}} <b>barrage</b> <b>jamming</b> attack is the optimal jamming strategy when the attacker has no knowledge of the target signal[16]. This section overviews specific derivations of radio jamming attacks against cellular networks based on the knowledge of the target LTE signal that an attacker can obtain from publicly available documents and standards. A popular new threat vector that can be exploited as a result of such attacks is also described.|$|E
30|$|Cooperative jamming is {{generally}} generated by small-scale jammers, which have limited power. There {{will be a}} radar uncertain position in the actual interference process. From the previous analysis, jamming against pulse compression radar with a single jammer has a significant disadvantage when there is radar position inaccuracy. In this case, multiple jammers are required to implement <b>barrage</b> <b>jamming</b> on the same area to increase the barrage power. The kind of cooperative interference mentioned above is called power-cooperative jamming.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} {{security architecture}} scrambles the PRB allocation of UL control channels so they cannot be {{the target of}} an uplink smart jamming attack.

An attacker, though, {{would not be able to}} locate any UL control channel and its best UL jamming strategy would be equivalent to a basic <b>barrage</b> <b>jamming.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{proposed}} theoretical {{security system}} {{is based on}} an enhancement of the resiliency against radio jamming of the PBCH by means of a spread spectrum transmission. This can be combined with scrambling of the PRB allocation of UL control channels and a distributed encryption scheme for downlink control broadcast messages. On one hand, the system protects its most vulnerable resources, downlink control channels, which are the target of DoS attacks[6]. On the other hand, MIB and SIB messages are protected so an attacker cannot learn any information on the PRB allocation for the other control channels, which are now randomly allocated in time and frequency. Only with the information encoded and encrypted in the MIB and SIB messages an attacker would be able to aim to the UL control channels with a jamming charge. Full application of such security solutions render a jamming attack to be only as effective as basic <b>barrage</b> <b>jamming.</b> Note that in jamming mitigation studies, the goal is precisely to force any sophisticated jamming attack to be just as efficient as standard jamming[17].|$|E
40|$|An error {{probability}} {{analysis of a}} communications link employing convolutional coding with soft decision viterbi decoding implemented on a fast frequency hopped, binary frequency shift keying (FFH(BFSK) spread spectrum system is performed. The signal is transmitted through a Rician fading channel with partial band noise interference. The receiver structures examined are the conventional receiver with no diversity, the conventional receiver with diversity and the assumption of perfect side information, and the self normalized combining receiver with diversity. The self normalized receiver minimizes the effects of hostile partial band interference, while diversity alleviates the effects of fading. It is found that {{with the implementation of}} soft decision viterbi decoding the performance of the self normalized receiver is improved dramatically for moderate coded bit energy to partialband noise power spectral density ratio (EbNI). Coding drives the jammer to a full band jamming strategy for worst case performance. Nearly worst case jamming occurs when <b>barrage</b> <b>jamming</b> is employed and there is no diversity even in cases where there is very strong direct signal. Performance improves as the constraint length of the convolutional code is increased. For the most powerful convolutional codes, performance is seen to degrade slightly with increasing diversity except in instances of a very weak direct signal. Also, soft decision decoding is found to be superior to hard decision decoding by approximately 4 dB at moderate Eb/NI. NANAU. S. Army (USA) autho...|$|E
