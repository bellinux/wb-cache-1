25|$|Lieutenant George William <b>Barrette</b> took command {{later in}} 1812. On 5 August 1813 Dominica was escorting the packet ship Princess Charlotte when she {{encountered}} the American privateer Decatur {{under the command}} of Captain Dominique Diron.|$|E
25|$|Decatur {{was more}} lightly armed, though more heavily manned, and {{prevailed in the}} fight. The British lost 18 men killed, 42 wounded, and 70 captured, {{including}} the wounded, with <b>Barrette</b> being among the killed. (One of the wounded was an 11-year-old ship's boy, wounded in three places.) The Americans had five men killed and 15 wounded. The court martial on 3 January 1815 of the surviving officers and men of Dominica acquitted them for her loss.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Barrettes</b> {{are worn}} in {{different}} ways partly according to their size, with small ones often used at the front and large ones in the back to hold more hair. They are used to keep hair out of the eyes, or to secure a bun, a French twist or a ponytail. Short metal [...] "clip" [...] <b>barrettes</b> are sometimes used to pull back front pieces of hair. <b>Barrettes</b> are also sometimes used purely for decorative purposes.|$|R

25|$|If the {{dressage}} rider {{has long}} hair, it is typically worn {{in a bun}} with a hair net or show bow. A hair net blends in with the rider's hair color, whereas a show bow combines a <b>barrette</b> or hair tie with a small bow and thick hair net, and is usually black. Lower-level riders may use a derby, hunting cap, or ASTM/SEI-approved Equestrian helmet. In the United States, junior riders and riders through Fourth Level at recognized competitions are required to wear an ASTM/SEI approved helmet to protect against head trauma {{in the event of}} a fall. At the upper levels, a top hat that matches the rider's coat is traditionally worn, though use of helmets is legal and increasing in popularity.|$|E

500|$|Mostly black, {{the third}} jersey {{incorporates}} horizontal striping {{intended to be}} reminiscent of the original Senators' 'barber-pole' designs, and the large letter O used in Ottawa jersey designs {{going back to the}} 1890s. The new , while an entirely new creation, most resembles the look of the 1926â€“27 Senators, when the franchise won its last Stanley Cup. Shield-type patches were added to the shoulders. The design of the shield-type patches was intended to be similar to the shield patches that the original Senators added to their jerseys after each Stanley Cup championship win. The patches spell the team name, one in English, and one in French. Jacob <b>Barrette,</b> a local Gatineau, Quebec fan had posted a similar design on the internet since 2009. [...] The Senators worked with <b>Barrette</b> to develop the jersey design in time for the 20th anniversary season.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a case {{history of a}} retaining wall designed by Arup and constructed in Kent, UK, between 1996 and 1998, {{as part of a}} highway cutting. The design methodology which was applied for this novel wall type is introduced, and measured horizontal displacements are presented and discussed. The design requirements specified that the wall had to be capable of supporting up to 8. 8 m of retained height and was not to be propped or anchored. To attain sufficient bending stiffness, Arup introduced a series of discrete <b>barrettes</b> perpendicular to the excavation. Arches of sprayed concrete retain the soil between the <b>barrettes</b> above dredge level. The <b>barrettes</b> were designed applying the general design principles for embedded retaining walls. Pore water pressures on the wall were reduced and controlled by installing a back of wall drainage system. Inclinometers in one of the instrumented wall sections were recently re-read. These data are shown and compared to the original predictions. Overall the wall showed only minor movements and satisfies the stated design requirements...|$|R

After signing, Love sought Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon to produce the album. In January 1991, Love sent her a letter, a Hello Kitty <b>barrette,</b> and copies of the band's early singles, mentioning that the band greatly admired Gordon's work and appreciated [...] "the production of the SST record" [...] (referring to Sonic Youth's EVOL or Sister). Gordon agreed {{on the condition that}} her friend, Gumball frontman Don Fleming, assist.|$|E
500|$|In {{a fashion}} similar to Sesame Streets {{international}} co-productions, {{a version of}} Oobi in the Persian language was produced without the original puppeteers' involvement in December 2012. It was titled Dasdasi ( [...] lit. Dasdasi: Clapping Hands) in reference to an Iranian folk song about clapping one's hands. [...] and , who wrote and directed the program, stated {{in an interview with}} Jaam-e Jam that they had watched episodes of Oobi in English and wished to create a tailored adaptation that highlighted elements of Iranian culture. Although the puppets in Dasdasi did not retain the original Oobi characters' personalities or roles, their key physical features (such as each puppet's eye color, Uma's <b>barrette,</b> and Kako's hat) remained. The cast of adult puppets, which was expanded to include a set of parents in addition to a single grandfather, wore Arab garments.|$|E
500|$|A novel {{feature of}} the game is its array of gadgets, often {{disguised}} as ordinary female fashion objects. For example, lipsticks double as various explosives, perfume bottles hold materials such as sleeping gas, a <b>barrette</b> also functions as a lockpick and poison dagger, sunglasses can be used for photographing evidence and detecting land mines, and a stylish belt buckle hides a zipcord inside it. Other over-the-top gadgets include a body-removing powder for disposing of incriminating corpses, a robotic poodle to distract guard dogs, and a rocket launcher disguised as a briefcase. An ordinary coin can be thrown to confuse enemies, giving the player the opportunity to sneak by without a guard noticing. A cigarette lighter can also be used as a miniature welding torch. These ingenious gadgets come from UNITY's gadget lab, led by its main inventor and scientist, Santa. [...] "Santa's Workshop" [...] continuously works on these covert gadgets, and provides Cate with them as the game progresses.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, many {{full-scale}} compression loading tests have been performed to verify the design parameters of the shaft resistance of rectangular <b>barrettes</b> and large-diameter bored piles founding in deep-seated thick saprolites in Hong Kong. In this study, comparisons are made between {{the results from the}} investigations of the behaviour of the mobilised shaft resistance with respect to the relative pile-soil movements (i. e. local displacements), the in situ soil properties (i. e. standard penetration test values), and the effective stress principle (with which the ss values are estimated). Also, the behaviour of the mobilised shaft resistance for the <b>barrettes</b> and bored piles in Hong Kong is compared with that elsewhere...|$|R

2500|$|The British {{agent at}} Charleston, South Carolina, {{wrote a letter}} {{suggesting}} {{that the cause of}} the loss was [...] "to be attributed entirely to the Want of Knowledge of and Experience in the Management of a Schooner, on the part of Captain <b>Barrette...</b> and the Vessel herself being extremely difficult to Work." [...] The same agent also reported that Decaturs crew was of French origin, [...] "chiefly, if not all, Blacks, and Mulattoes" [...] and that on boarding they had behaved with utmost cruelty, slaughtering the wounded on deck. A letter from the Judge of the District Court stated that the prisoners had been treated with the utmost humanity.
