25|$|A beam {{projector}} is a lensless instrument {{with very}} little <b>beam</b> <b>spread.</b> It uses two reflectors. The primary reflector is a parabolic reflector and the secondary reflector is a spherical reflector. The parabolic reflector directs the light into nearly parallel beams, and the spherical reflector is {{placed in front of}} the lamp to reflect light from the lamp back to the parabolic reflector, which reduces spill. The result is an intense shaft of light that cannot be easily controlled or modified. The beam projector no longer is used {{to the extent that it}} once was, as newer fixtures and PAR lamps have created easier ways to produce the effect.|$|E
25|$|Since November 19, 2004, {{there have}} been over 2,800 {{incidents}} of lasers directed at aircraft within the United States. These concerns have led to an inquiry in the US Congress. Exposure to hand-held laser light under such circumstances may seem trivial given the brevity of exposure, the large distances involved and <b>beam</b> <b>spread</b> of up to several metres. However, laser exposure may create dangerous conditions such as flash blindness. If this occurs during a critical moment in aircraft operation, the aircraft may be endangered. In addition, some 18% to 35% of the population possess the autosomal dominant genetic trait, photic sneeze, that causes the affected individual to experience an involuntary sneezing fit when exposed to a sudden flash of light. Some observers believe that the danger is greatly exaggerated, at least for small hand-held lasers.|$|E
25|$|Parabolic Aluminized Reflector lights, or PAR lights, or PAR cans, {{are used}} when a {{substantial}} amount of flat lighting is required for a scene. A PAR can is a sealed beam PAR lamp housed in a simple can-like unit.

PAR lamps are widely used in architectural lighting and may often be found at hardware stores. PAR lights have seen heavy use in rock and roll shows, especially those with smaller budgets, due to their low cost, light weight, easy maintenance, high durability, and high output. They are often used in combination with smoke or haze machines which make the path of the beam visible. They are also often used as top, back, or side lights in the theatre and for special effects.|$|E

2500|$|ERS or profile {{lanterns}} {{have many}} useful features. One {{of the most}} useful are the metal shutters at the focal plane of the lens to shape the beam of light. The original shape of the beam is round, but {{with the use of}} the shutters one can limit the beam to avoid obstacles or parts of the set that should not be illuminated in a specific look. Another feature is a gate, also in the focal plane, for sliding in gobos (also known as templates or deckles). These have patterns cut into them, much like a stencil. These patterns are projected onto the stage. An iris can be also be inserted in this position to make the beam smaller in diameter, reducing the light cast without the sharp edges of the shutters. ERS instruments from ETC, Altman, Selecon, and a variety of others have interchangeable lens tubes (or barrels) which can both create a very sharp or very soft beam as well as alter the <b>beam</b> <b>spread.</b> The barrel sizes can range from a narrow, long distance 5- or 10-degree spot to a broad and short-distance 50- or even 90-degree. The first 90-degree profile lantern was developed by Selecon Performance Lighting as part of their [...] "Pacific" [...] range of products. Since its introduction many other manufacturers have introduced their own 90-degree barrels. ERS instruments allow many different lens tubes to be used with the same body. This makes them more versatile, since a venue can purchase varying degrees of barrels without buying as many instruments. Many manufacturers also produce zoom lenses which offer the ability to change the beam angle. Some zoom ranges have a poorer optical quality making them difficult to use in sharp focus.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{pulse-echo}} ultrasonic NDE {{techniques are}} useful in the evaluation for structural flaws in components manufactured from homogeneous materials (i. e. most metals). However, composite materials are often neither homogeneous nor isotropic which decreases the sensitivity of traditional techniques by making the resultant data difficult to interpret. Composite materials also tend to attenuate the ultrasonic energy {{to a greater degree}} than metals decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio needed for confident flaw detection. The attenuation is attributed to the absorption of energy by the matrix and the scattering of energy due to the inherent scatterers in the system such as fibers and small voids or porosity. For very thick composites these difficulties are amplified. In addition, a component of the attenuation due to ultrasonic <b>beam</b> <b>spreading</b> increases with thickness.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} incorporating a <b>beam</b> <b>spreading</b> parameter in a beam angle optimization algorithm and to evaluate its efficacy for creating coplanar IMRT lung plans in conjunction with machine learning generated dose objectives. Methods: Fifteen anonymized patient cases were each re-planned with ten values over {{the range of the}} <b>beam</b> <b>spreading</b> parameter, k, and analyzed with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to determine whether any particular value resulted in significant improvement over the initially treated plan created by a trained dosimetrist. Dose constraints were generated by a machine learning algorithm and kept constant for each case across all k values. Parameters investigated for potential improvement included mean lung dose, V 20 lung, V 40 heart, 80 % conformity index, and 90 % conformity index. Results: With a confidence level of 5 %, treatment plans created with this method resulted in significantly better conformity indices. Dose coverage to the PTV was improved by an average of 12 % over the initial plans. At the same time, these treatment plans showed no significant difference in mean lung dose, V 20 lung, or V 40 heart when compared to the initial plans; however, {{it should be noted that}} these results could be influenced by the small sample size of patient cases. Conclusions: The beam angle optimization algorithm, with the inclusion of the <b>beam</b> <b>spreading</b> parameter k, increases the dose conformity of the automatically generated treatment plans over that of the initial plans without adversely affecting the dose to organs at risk. This parameter can be varied according to physician preference in order to control the tradeoff between dose conformity and OAR sparing without compromising the integrity of the plan. Thesi...|$|R
