50|$|The Muzo were {{a people}} of healthy warriors, {{although}} they didn't reach old ages. Their health {{is attributed to}} the fact they were vegetarian, although other sources state they performed cannibalism. The living spaces were always constructed {{in the vicinity of}} waterfalls or springs. The hotter climate of the lower terrain made them sweat and they bathed often. Many Muzo children were born covered with <b>bristle</b> <b>hair</b> which made the supersticious mothers kill their babies. The Muzo people lived naked and gave their children names of trees, animals and plants.|$|E
40|$|Pogostemon cablin {{possesses}} two morphologically and ontogenetically {{different types}} of glandular trichomes, one type of <b>bristle</b> <b>hair</b> on the surfaces of leaves and stems and one type of internal gland inside the leaves and stems. The internal gland originates from elementary meristem and {{is associated with the}} biosynthesis of oils present inside the leaves and stems. However, there is little information on mechanism for the oil biosynthesis and secretion inside the leaves and stems. In this study, we identified three kinds of glandular trichome types and two kinds of internal gland in the Pogostemon cablin. The oil secretions from internal glands of stems and leaves contained lipids, flavones and terpenes. Our results indicated that endoplasmic reticulum and plastids and vacuoles are likely involved in the biosynthesis of oils in the internal glands and the synthesized oils are transported from endoplasmic reticulum to the cell wall via connecting endoplasmic reticulum membranes to the plasma membrane. And the comparative analysis of the development, distribution, histochemistry and ultrastructures of the internal and external glands in Pogostemon cablin leads us to propose that the internal gland may be a novel secretory structure which is different from external glands...|$|E

60|$|Through {{no matter}} what indignation and rage that possessed him, his lord's voice {{penetrated}} his consciousness, so that, cooling almost instantly, Michael's ears flattened, his <b>bristling</b> <b>hair</b> lay down, and his lips covered his fangs as {{he turned his head}} to look acknowledgment.|$|R
60|$|He {{pulled the}} hound over {{and set it}} on the track of the three men. The {{creature}} sniffed at it once or twice, and then, falling upon its stomach, with <b>bristling</b> <b>hair</b> and protruding tongue, it lay shivering and trembling, a very embodiment of canine terror.|$|R

60|$|A most unsociable dog {{he proved}} to be, resenting all their advances, {{refusing to let}} them lay hands on him, menacing them with bared fangs and <b>bristling</b> <b>hair.</b> Nevertheless he remained, {{sleeping}} and resting by the spring, and eating the food they gave him after they set it down {{at a safe distance}} and retreated. His wretched physical condition explained why he lingered; and when he had recuperated, after several days' sojourn, he disappeared.|$|R
60|$|The great hound {{recognized}} {{the voice and}} his aspect changed at once. The <b>bristling</b> <b>hair</b> lay flat on his back; the threatening jaws closed. He gave a short deep bark of pleasure, and then began leaping and tugging at his chain to reach his acquaintance. Archie came close to him now. Hector reared on his hind legs, and placed his great paws on his shoulders, and licked his face with whines of joy.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked over}} her {{shoulder}} and discovered Mr. Britling approaching by the field path. He looked white and tired and listless, even his <b>bristling</b> <b>hair</b> and moustache conveyed his depression; he was dressed in an old tweed knickerbocker suit and carrying a big atlas and some papers. He had an effect of hesitation in his approach. It was {{as if he wanted to}} talk to her and doubted her reception for him.|$|R
60|$|Amidst this sordid scene, sat a {{man with}} his clenched hands resting on his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground. I knew Mr. Rochester; though the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one arm, {{as if it had}} been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, <b>bristling</b> <b>hair</b> might well have {{disguised}} him. As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were attached fetters.|$|R
60|$|Once a {{lion and}} a lioness stood beneath our tree and gazed out with <b>bristling</b> <b>hair</b> and {{blinking}} eyes. The lion licked his chops and was nervous with eagerness, {{as if he}} wanted to go forward and make a meal. But the lioness was more cautious. It was she that discovered us, and the pair stood and looked up at us, silently, with twitching, scenting nostrils. Then they growled, looked once again at the fire, and turned away into the forest.|$|R
60|$|Though I {{never saw}} Narmonee in battle, I will, from what I then observed, stake my life upon his courage and fortitude. Before commencing operations, his head had {{presented}} a surface of short <b>bristling</b> <b>hairs,</b> {{and by the}} time I had concluded my unskilful operation it resembled not a little a stubble field after being gone over with a harrow. However, as the chief expressed the liveliest satisfaction at the result, I was too wise to dissent from his opinion.|$|R
50|$|Camponotus reburrus (from Latin, reburrus, meaning {{one with}} <b>bristling</b> <b>hair,</b> {{referring}} to the hairs on the head) is a species of carpenter ants in the subfamily Formicinae. It is known only from northeastern Ecuador. C. reburrus apparently has an obligatory relationship with the ant plants Cecropia membranacea, Cecropia herthae and Cecropia marginalis. The workers are relatively small and hairy, {{it does not appear}} to have major workers. It is similar to Camponotus balzani which also lives in Cecropia spp. (but has normal major workers).|$|R
60|$|A {{measured}} {{step was}} heard upon the stairs, {{and a moment}} later a stout, tall, gray-whiskered and solemnly respectable person was ushered into the room. His life history was written in his heavy features and pompous manner. From his spats to his gold-rimmed spectacles he was a Conservative, a churchman, a good citizen, orthodox and conventional to the last degree. But some amazing experience had disturbed his native composure and left its traces in his <b>bristling</b> <b>hair,</b> his flushed, angry cheeks, and his flurried, excited manner. He plunged instantly into his business.|$|R
60|$|She bounded in amongst them, her {{anxious and}} militant {{motherhood}} making her {{anything but a}} pretty sight. But to the cub the spectacle of her protective rage was pleasing. He uttered a glad little cry and bounded to meet her, while the man-animals went back hastily several steps. The she-wolf stood over against her cub, facing the men, with <b>bristling</b> <b>hair,</b> a snarl rumbling deep in her throat. Her face was distorted and malignant with menace, even {{the bridge of the}} nose wrinkling from tip to eyes so prodigious was her snarl.|$|R
6000|$|Roger {{felt as if}} his raw, quivering soul {{were being}} seared. He looked at his aunt curiously--at her broad, flat face with the mole {{on the end of}} her dumpy nose, the <b>bristling</b> <b>hairs</b> on her chin, the {{wrinkled}} yellow neck, the pale, protruding eyes, the coarse, good-humoured mouth. She was so extremely ugly--and he had seen her across the table all his life. For twenty-five years he had looked at her so. Must he continue to go on looking at ugliness {{in the shape of a}} wife all the rest of his life--he, who worshipped beauty in everything? ...|$|R

60|$|But Michael {{knew nothing}} of this. And the big Persian knew of his {{existence}} before he did of hers. In fact, the first he knew was when she launched herself upon {{him out of the}} open wheel-house doorway. Even as he glimpsed this abrupt danger, and before he could know what it was, he leaped sideways and saved himself. From his point of view, the assault was unprovoked. He was staring at her with <b>bristling</b> <b>hair,</b> recognizing her for what she was, a cat, when she sprang again, her tail {{the size of a large}} man's arm, all claws and spitting fury and vindictiveness.|$|R
60|$|Here he {{ceased to}} be the oakum-headed, oakum-whiskered man on whom Miss Pleasant Riderhood had looked, and, {{allowing}} for his being still wrapped in a nautical overcoat, became as like that same lost wanted Mr Julius Handford, as never man was like another in this world. In the breast of the coat he stowed the <b>bristling</b> <b>hair</b> and whisker, in a moment, as the favouring wind went with him down a solitary place that it had swept clear of passengers. Yet in that same moment he was the Secretary also, Mr Boffin's Secretary. For John Rokesmith, too, was as like that same lost wanted Mr Julius Handford as never man was like another in this world.|$|R
6000|$|I did {{not like}} it, I can tell you; for there was neither stick nor stone about, and I knew that the brute was dangerous. The Major was shrieking to it from behind, and I think that the {{creature}} {{thought that he was}} hallooing it on, so furiously did it rush. But I knew its name, and I thought that maybe that might give me the privileges of acquaintanceship; so as it came at me with <b>bristling</b> <b>hair</b> and its nose screwed back between its two red eyes, I cried out [...] "Bounder! Bounder!" [...] at the pitch of my lungs. It had its effect, for the beast passed me with a snarl, and flew along the path on the traces of Bonaventure de Lapp.|$|R
6000|$|As he saw us {{he threw}} off his pack {{to rest and}} stood erect, a sturdy man of sixty, with short <b>bristling</b> <b>hair</b> framing a kindly {{resolute}} face. He was very light-hearted. He shook hands with me, saying, [...] "Kla-how-ya," [...] in answer to my, [...] "Kla-how-ya six," [...] which is to say, [...] "How are you, friend?" [...] He smiled, pointed to his pack, and said, [...] "Hy-u skin." [...] His season had been successful {{and he was going}} now to sell his catch. A couple of dogs just behind carried each twenty pounds on their backs. We were eating lunch, and I invited him to sit and eat. He took a seat and began to parcel out the food in two piles.|$|R
