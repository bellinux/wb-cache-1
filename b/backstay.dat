25|$|A {{fractional}} rigged sloop has its forestay attached {{at a point}} {{below the}} top of the mast, allowing the mainsail to be flattened to improve performance by raking {{the upper part of the}} mast aft by tensioning the <b>backstay.</b> A smaller headsail is easier for a short-handed crew to manage.|$|E
25|$|The spars are {{designed}} by C and fabricated by Offshore Spars. The standard boat has a keel stepped non-tapered double spreader masthead sloop rig, with rod rigging and a hydraulic <b>backstay</b> adjuster. the R and XL variants have a tapered triple-spreader mast with all rod rigging, plus runners, checkstays, and an adjustable babystay for mast bend control. The <b>backstay</b> is split, with two hydraulic rams, on the boats with walk through transom (37+ and XL). The masthead, gooseneck and boom end are custom machined aluminum, welded {{to the one}} piece extrusion. The aerodynamic spreaders are secured to the mast via machined, continuous aluminum spreader bars. They precisely fit the spreader bases and traverse the mast and along with separate support bars carry the compression loads exerted by the shrouds. On the 37R (and 37XL) mast the middle and lower spreaders are slightly swept back, 2° for the middle spreaders, 4° for the lowers.|$|E
25|$|At sea, {{it used to}} be {{that the}} ensign was flown from the mizzen gaff. When Bermudian sails came into general use, some skippers started to fly the ensign from two-thirds the way up the main-sail leech. Many {{consider}} this an affectation with the past. Others have taken to flying the ensign from a <b>backstay.</b> These are not good locations because the flag does not fly out well when hoisted raked forward.|$|E

5000|$|Gaff rig is a sailing rig (configuration of sails, mast and stays) {{in which}} the sail is four-cornered, fore-and-aft rigged, {{controlled}} at its peak and, usually, its entire head by a spar (pole) called the gaff. Because of {{the size and shape}} of the sail, a gaff rig will have running <b>backstays</b> rather than permanent <b>backstays.</b>|$|R
500|$|The German-import masts {{are united}} by 120 {{high-strength}} steel cables that total approximately [...] in length. [...] They are inclined at a 10 degree angle from vertical. [...] Each tapered composite mast {{that supports the}} flattened S-shaped roof girders is supported by 15 splaying cables; 9 fore-stay cables and 6 <b>backstay</b> cables. During construction, the masts were filled with [...] cast-in-place concrete using innovative pumping techniques.|$|E
500|$|The toroidal-shaped stadium roof is held {{together}} by a tensioned system, which {{has been described as}} [...] "ground-breaking" [...] by New Steel Construction magazine. The stadium's architectural focal point is the sweeping roof and support masts which are separate from the concrete bowl. A catenary cable is situated around the inner perimeter of the roof structure which is tied to the masts via forestay cables. <b>Backstay</b> cables and corner ties from the masts are connected to the ground to support the structure. With the expansion of the South Stand in 2015 to accommodate a third tier of seating, the original south end roof was dismantled; but with the southern masts and corner ties remaining, so as to continue to tie the catenary cable which now runs below the new roof. [...] The new higher South Stand roof is a separate structure, with its own set of braced masts and cables; and it is expected that a counterpart arrangement will be adopted for the proposed North Stand expansion.|$|E
500|$|The MBA was {{authorized}} in 1952 to sell bonds to finance construction, which were sold on December 17, 1953, {{to finance the}} $99.8million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) cost of the bridge. The structure was designed by David B. Steinman and built by Merritt-Chapman & Scott for the substructure and the American Bridge Company division of U.S. Steel Corporation for the superstructure. Construction started in 1954 and the Mackinac Bridge opened to traffic on November 1, 1957. Final work on the bridge was completed in September 1958. Overall, the structure has a [...] central suspension span flanked by two [...] side spans. With the two <b>backstay</b> spans, the Mackinac Bridge is [...] long between cable anchorages, the longest {{in the world at}} the time it opened. The total length of the structure is [...] with two [...] towers and [...] of clearance for passing ships under the main span. In 2000, the bridge was named [...] "Michigan's No. 1 Civil Engineering Project of the 20th Century" [...] by the Michigan Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), and the structure was named a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 2010 by the national ASCE.|$|E

Here the mate returned, {{according}} to his orders, leaped upon the rigging, and thence upon a <b>backstay,</b> when he slid on deck with a velocity that set aim at defiance.

5000|$|If {{the running}} <b>backstays</b> {{lead to the}} mast where the {{forestay}} attaches, the effect of tensioning them will reduce sag in the headsail and second, increase mast bend and flatten the mainsail as a result. Both effects are desirable as the wind increases.|$|R
