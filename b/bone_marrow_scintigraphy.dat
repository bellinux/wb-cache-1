A {{receiver operating characteristic}} (ROC) analysis was performed to compare BS to BS+BMS on a patient-by-patient basis using a 'gold standard' composed of subsequent computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, X-ray or BS examinations {{and at least a}} 12 month follow-up. Metastases were present in eight out of 60 patients (13 %). Specificity was improved by BS+BMS compared to BS alone (90 %, 65 %) as well as positive predictive value (62 %, 27 %), accuracy (87 %, 72 %), positive (10. 4, 2. 4) and negative (0. 20, 0. 00) likelihood ratios. Sensitivity (100 %, 88 %) and negative predictive value (100 %, 97 %) were similar for BMS+BS and BS alone. As a result of BMS, clinical management was modified in 15 patients (25 %). In conclusion, BMS supplements BS by improving specificity, positive predictive value and accuracy in detecting breast cancer bone metastases.

The specific localization of radio-labeled CEA 79 antibody in bone marrow depends on its reactivity with NCA- 95 (nonspecific cross-reacting antigen- 95) present on the surface and in the cytosol of human granulocytes and myelopoietic cells. To make a CEA 79 scFv molecule that would be less immunogenic and more penetrating than the intact mouse immunoglobulin, we constructed a pRSET Sfi I/Not I expression vector. The scFv gene was then excised from a pCANTAB 5 E phage display vector by digestion with Sfi I and Not I and inserted into the pRSET Sfi I/Not I expression vector. Upon transformation of a BL 21 (DE 3) pLysS strain of E, coli, CEA 79 scFv became expressed in inclusion bodies requiring a renaturation process for solubilization, The final yield of CEA 79 scFv was 5 mg per a liter of culture.

40|$|Objective: A serious {{complication}} of joint replacement surgery is infection, {{which results in}} prolonged invalidity due to decrease in joint function and hospitalization, often resulting in removal and subsequent re-implantation after lengthy antibiotic therapy. Labeled leukocyte scintigraphy (LS) is considered a valuable tool in preoperative diagnosis of prosthetic joint infections. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine imaging of in vitro radioactively labeled autologous leukocytes and bone marrow scans in their accuracy and reliability in detecting infection in patients with prosthetic joints. Furthermore, inflammation markers CRP and WBC count were analyzed for their accuracy in detecting prosthetic joint infection. Methods: This single center study included all patients suspected of having prosthetic joint infections between January and September 2013 at the Vienna General Hospital. A total of 45 mL blood was drawn from a peripheral vein and leukocytes were radioactively labeled with Tc- 99 m-HMPAO according to protocol. The labeled leukocytes were then re-injected into a peripheral vein. A whole body scintigraphy and local images were recorded with a double-headed gamma camera four hours after re-injection.

The results showed that RG depicted more lesions than BS, while BSdepicted fractures at sites not optimally seen on RG. RG and BS gaveno information of prognostic value. In paper ll MS is compared to RG and BS. The results showed thatMS only gave a marginal increase of information on focal lesions. MSwas superior for depicting the sites of prior focal radiotherapy. MSshowed {{that the majority of the}} patients had peripheral red bonemarrow expansion. At MS, a monoclonal antibody radiophammaceutical(which is specific for the granulopoietic system) was superior to ananocolloid (which is specific for the reticulo-endothelial system) for the detection of lesions. In paper 11 l dynamic registration at BS and MS is evaluated. Theresults showed that no additional information was revealed at dynamicregistrations when these were compared to static registrations or toRG and MRI. In paper IV the location and cause of radionuclide activity notedoccasionally in the abdominal region at MS is analysed. Theconclusion was that the activity was localised to thegastro-intestinal tract and that the activity was considered to be atleast partly due to an in vivo degradation of theradiopharmaceutical. In paper V the use of MRI is evaluated. Theresults showed that a greater spread of lesions was found with MRIthan with RG. For MM patients the optimal sequences were SET 1 -weighted and TIR, performed without intra-venous contrast media. The conclusions are: * - RG is the base for detecting Iytic skeletal lesions * - BS is an auxiliary method for detecting suspected skeletal lesions - MS depicts the entire distribution of red bone marrow * - MRI is the optimal method for depicting the entire patient, except for the bony skeleton.

40|$|Abstract Gaucher's {{disease is}} a {{lysosomal}} storage disorder due to a genetically transmitted deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. In {{the most common form}} of the disease (type 1), accumulation of glucosylceramide in the reticuloendothelial cells of liver, spleen, and bone marrow leads to visceromegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and osteopenia. Skeletal manifestations secondary to infiltration of the bone marrow by Gaucher's cells are detectable by radiography only in advanced stages. Imaging of bone marrow involvement can be performed indirectly by magnetic resonance techniques or by <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> with radiocolloids. However, both procedures lack specificity because the normal bone marrow, rather than the pathologic process, is imaged. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability of (99 m) Tc-sestamibi scintigraphy for direct evaluation of bone marrow involvement. METHODS: Seventy-two patients with type 1 and 2 patients with type 3 Gaucher's disease (35 males, 39 females) were enrolled in the study. The mean age +/- SD was 31. 9 +/- 16. 5 y (range, 3 - 76 y), and the average duration of the disease manifestations when performing scintigraphy was 12. 95 y (median, 10. 5 y; range, 0 - 44 y). Forty-three of 74 patients had never received enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), whereas 31 patients were already being treated with ERT. (99 m) Tc-Sestamibi was injected intravenously (6 - 8 MBq/kg of body weight) and imaging was recorded at the lower limbs 30 min after injection, at the plateau of tracer accumulation in the involved bone marrow. The scans were evaluated visually, assigning a semiquantitative score based on the extension and intensity of uptake in the bone marrow of the lower limbs (0 = no uptake; 8 = maximum uptake). The scintigraphic score was entered into complex statistical analysis, which included a series of clinical and blood chemistry parameters defining overall severity of the disease. RESULTS: (99 m) Tc-Sestamibi scintigraphy showed that 71 of 74 patients had some degree of bone marrow involvement. The scintigraphic score was highly correlated with an overall clinical severity score index (SSI) and with various parameters contributing to the SSI, either positively or negatively. The highest correlation of the scintigraphic score was found with an overall biochemical marker of disease severity (serum chitotriosidase). ERT-naive patients showed high correlation of the scintigraphic score with the clinical SSI, with a radiographically based score, and with serum chitotriosidase. In the ERT-treated patients, the scintigraphic score was correlated with the clinical SSI, with hepatomegaly, and with hemoglobin. CONCLUSION: (99 m) Tc-Sestamibi uptake reliably identifies bone marrow infiltration by Gaucher's cells. The scintigraphic score is helpful for defining the severity of bone marrow involvement and for comparing patients. (99 m) Tc-Sestamibi scintigraphy, which provides topographic information about the sites involved by the disease, is highly correlated with other parameters of disease severity and appears to correlate with response to ERT...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Adequate {{dosimetry}} {{is mandatory}} for effective and safe peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). Besides the kidneys, the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> is a potentially dose-limiting organ. The radiation dose to the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> is usually calculated {{according to the}} MIRD scheme, where the accumulated activity in the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> is calculated from the accumulated radioactivity of the radiopharmaceutical in the blood. This may underestimate the absorbed dose since stem cells express somatostatin receptors. We verified the blood-based method by comparing the activity in the blood with the radioactivity in <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> aspirates. Also, we evaluated the absorbed cross-dose from the source organs (liver, spleen, kidneys and blood), tumours and the so-called "remainder of the body" to the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow.</b> Methods: <b>Bone</b> <b>marrow</b> aspirates were drawn in 15 patients after treatment with [177 Lu-DOTA 0,Tyr 3]octreotate. Radioactivity in the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> was compared with radioactivity in the blood drawn simultaneously. The nucleated cell fraction was isolated from the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> aspirate and radioactivity was measured. The absorbed dose to the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> was calculated. The results were correlated to the change in platelet counts 6 weeks after treatment. Results: A strong linear correlation and high agreement between the measured radioactivities in the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> aspirates and in the blood was found (r= 0. 914, p< 0. 001). No correlation between the calculated absorbed dose in the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> and the change in platelets was found.

Various anti-leukemic agents {{were added to the}} culture media at the maximum concentration where they would not inhibit the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> growth in culture, and observations were carried out to see the influences of these agents on the function of megakaryocytes of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow.</b> As the results, the author arrived at the follwing conclusions. 1. Urethane. Nitromin. Demecolcin, Actinomycin C and Mitomycin C inhibit the thrombopoietic function of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> to a high degree. 2. Thio-TEPA, 8 -Azaguanine, Carzinophilin, and Chromomycin demonstrate a moderate inhibitory action on the thrombopoietic function of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow.</b> 3. 6 -MP slightly inhibits the thrombopoietic function of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow.</b> 4. Myleran, and the combined use of 6 -MP and Prednisolone show no inhibitory effect on the thrombopoietic function of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow.</b> 5. On the other hand, Prednisolone alone rather augments the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> thrombopoietic function...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bone</b> <b>marrow</b> {{necrosis}} is {{a poorly}} understood and frequently an unrec ognized finding in routine <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> biopsies. Previous reports indi cate {{the incidence of}} <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> necrosis ranges from 0. 5 percent (rare) to approximately one-third of all <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> biopsies examined. Our studies indicate {{that the presence of}} <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> necrosis depends on the clinical condition of the patient. Overall, our incidence of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> necrosis was 37 percent of the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> biopsies examined. Of these, 26. 4 percent was mild. 7. 5 percent m oderate, and 3. 1 percent severe necrosis. The mechanism in most cases had an identifiable underlying eti ology such as a malignancy, or vascular or cytotoxic damage, with a small percentage being unexplained. <b>Bone</b> <b>marrow</b> necrosis is seen across a wide range of conditions, includ ing sickle cell diseases, AIDS, leukemia, lymphoma, m etastatic carci noma, anemia, sepsis, and o ther systemic diseases. Patients at the extremes of age, less than 20 years and greater than 70 years, usually demonstrate only small foci of necrosis (Grade I). Moderate (Grade II) and severe (Grade III) <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> necrosis are often associated with life threatening illnesses, with most of these being hematologic malignancies or <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> metastases. The prognosis associated with <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> necrosis seems to be dependent on the underlying primary clinical condi tion regardless of the degree of necrosis observed...|$|R
40|$|By {{observing the}} <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> {{obtained}} from the femur of rabbits with kollargol-induced anemia in bone-marrow tissue culture by cover-slip method, the following results were obtained. 1) When kollargol is added to normal <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> in culture, kollargol acts directly on the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> and inhibits its tissue growth. 2) The <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> which has become hyperplastic the tissue growth has been found better than control; the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> in which parenchymal cells have decreased in number does not necessarily show {{a decline in the}} tissue growth or in the cell function; and the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> in which parenchymal cells have markedly decreased show a marked fall both in the tissue growth and in the cell function. 3) The following may be assumed from the foregoing: Although kollargol acts directly on <b>bone</b> <b>marrow,</b> thus inhibiting the tissue growth, in the continuous injections it promotes the tissue growth of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> at first, and later inhibiting it, gradually decreases the number of parenchymal cells; and finally presents the tissue-culture picture similar to that of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> which is completely damaged. 4) However, because the number of fat cells are decreased in tissue culture of the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> which is completely damaged, tissue-culture of such <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> presents a picture differing from that observed in human hypoplastic anemia...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: <b>Bone</b> <b>marrow</b> can undergo {{necrosis}} {{for many}} different causes; malignant causes {{are reported to}} be more frequent. Methods: We undertook a 10 -year retrospective review of all <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> biopsy specimens with <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> necrosis at our institution. Results: Identified cases represented approximately 0. 3 % of our <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> cases. Most identified <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> cases with necrosis were involved by metastatic tumor or hematolymphoid malignancy (90 % of total) in relatively equal proportions. In those cases of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> necrosis with hematolymphoid malignancy, lymphoid disease predominated and the necrosis was often seen {{in the setting of}} chemotherapy.
