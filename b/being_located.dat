5|$|On April17, a weak low exited {{from the}} coast of South Africa and moved southeastward over the warm waters of the {{southern}} Mozambique Channel. By April19, it had organized into a subtropical depression and produced gale force winds.

5|$|Tropical Depression Sixteen-E {{formed from}} a {{disturbance}} in the intertropical convergence zone. Despite <b>being</b> <b>located</b> {{in a hostile}} environment, it managed to organize into a tropical depression on November 14. It was briefly forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm. However, wind shear prevented that from occurring. Consequently, the depression degenerated into a remnant low on November 16 and dissipated soon after that.|$|E
5|$|Variance in {{recovered}} phylogenetic {{positions for}} Eolambia persisted in following years. In the 2009 description of Levnesovia, Hans-Dieter Sues and Alexander Averianov found that Protohadros occupied an intermediate position relative to Altirhinus and Probactrosaurus, being the sister group of Fukuisaurus (results reproduced below). Meanwhile, {{in accordance with}} the results of Horner and colleagues, Albert Prieto-Márquez and Mark Norell found in 2010 that Eolambia was instead the sister group of Protohadros. He also noted features of Eolambia that were convergent upon hadrosaurids: the presence of a single tooth carina; the nearly-square outer corner of the predentary; and the midpoint of the quadratojugal notch (which articulates with the quadratojugal) <b>being</b> <b>located</b> roughly halfway up the surface of the quadrate (<b>being</b> <b>located</b> less than 60% of the bone's height down from the top). In 2012, Holtz classified Eolambia as a primitive member of the Styracosterna along with Altirhinus.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance was observed on November19 about 800km (500mi) southeast of Colombo, Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal. The disturbance tracked westward, gradually organizing and prompting the JTWC {{to issue a}} Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on November22. After passing south of Sri Lanka, it became disorganized and was no longer considered likely to develop into a tropical cyclone. The circulation associated with the system continued westward, reorganizing on November26 in the Arabian Sea. Despite <b>being</b> <b>located</b> unusually close to the equator, the disturbance maintained convection, or thunderstorms, which was becoming organized around the weak low-level circulation. With low wind shear and diffluence aloft, the JTWC remarked the system had a fair chance of developing.|$|E

5|$|As well as <b>being</b> <b>located</b> in {{a region}} of the galaxy that is {{chemically}} advantageous {{for the development of}} life, a star must also avoid an excessive number of catastrophic cosmic events with the potential to damage life on its otherwise habitable planets. Nearby supernovae, for example, have the potential to severely harm life on a planet; with excessive frequency, such catastrophic outbursts have the potential to sterilize an entire region of a galaxy for billions of years. The galactic bulge, for example, experienced an initial wave of extremely rapid star formation, triggering a cascade of supernovae that for five billion years left that area almost completely unable to develop life.|$|E
5|$|<b>Being</b> <b>located</b> {{just inside}} the Lions' Gate, {{one of the major}} entries to the Old City, the East Jerusalem Development Company {{initially}} intended to excavate the reservoir and build a multi-storey car park at the site. This post-1967 plan was rejected by the waqf authorities who own the plot because they feared that clearance work {{at the base of the}} Temple Mount would endanger the Haram compound. Subsequently, in 1981 a small square equipped with benches was constructed on part of the covered pool.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>being</b> <b>located</b> {{in remote}} Scapa Flow, Battleship Division Nine {{was unable to}} avoid a global killer that struck just as World War I was coming to a close. Spanish Influenza—which killed {{millions}} worldwide in 1918–1919—did not spare the Grand Fleet. By late fall, an average of seven men per day were dying of the virus throughout the Fleet, and some ships were so badly affected that they were practically unmanageable. Though they were not as badly hit {{as some of the}} British vessels, the American battleships were not immune. By early November, only Florida was not in quarantine, and Arkansas had 259 cases, with 11 deaths.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>being</b> <b>located</b> outside Kyustendil at the time, {{up until}} the {{construction}} of the city's main Bulgarian National Revival-style church in 1816, the Church of St George served as Kyustendil's cathedral.

It was reconstructed in 1878–1880, just after the establishment of the Principality of Bulgaria, with further restoration in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Dry air began {{impacting}} Nadine on September17, though outflow {{from the}} storm prevented significant weakening. Despite a large flare of deep convection over the northern semicircle, Nadine weakened slightly later that day.
