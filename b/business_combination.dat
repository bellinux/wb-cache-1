40|$|The {{accounting}} for <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> {{is a very}} important area, therefore it needs a high quality accounting standard {{that could be used for}} both domestic and cross-border financial reporting.

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{addresses}} {{two distinct}} aspects of disharmony in {{international accounting standards}} setting. The first aspect relates to the political economic context of financial accounting standards. This {{is illustrated by the}} Chinese standards setters’ decision to allow the pooling of interests method of accounting for <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> despite the prohibition of this method by both the FASB and the IASB. This decision by the Chinese standards setters appears to have been based on political economic factors related to the need for industrial reorganization in China rather than a desire to serve the needs of global capital markets. The second aspect of disharmony relates to the role played by differential understandings of the fundamental objectives of financial reporting in an international context. The IASB’s goal of producing one set of global accounting standards to serve the needs of global capital markets has led to a {{reduction in the number of}} permissible accounting methods and a move towards the fair value accounting model. In particular, the IASB concluded that the acquisition method of accounting for <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> should be the only method allowed for <b>business</b> <b>combinations.</b> In contrast, the Chinese standards setters have recognized the existence of both mergers and acquisitions, and in response they created two different methods of accounting for <b>business</b> <b>combinations.</b> Effectively, the Chinese standards setters developed an alternative approach to accounting for <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> which challenges the IASB’s goal of achieving international accounting convergence through the fair value model...|$|R

Additionally, a critical evaluation of the pooling & purchase methods of merger accounting is presented in an effort to explain the relative aversion of accounting bodies to the pooling method.

50|$|As {{a result}} of the voting and {{conversion}} rights held by SPAC shareholders, only well-received transactions are typically approved by the shareholders. When a deal is proposed, a shareholder has three options. The shareholder can approve the transaction by voting in favor of it, elect to sell their shares in the open market, or vote against the transaction and redeem their shares for a pro-rata share of the trust account. (This is significantly different from the blind pool - blank check companies of the 1980s, which were a form of limited partnership that did not specify what investment opportunities the company plans to pursue.) The assets of the trust are only released if a <b>business</b> <b>combination</b> is approved by the voting shareholders, or a <b>business</b> <b>combination</b> is not consummated within 24 months of the initial offering. This guarantees a minimum liquidation value per share in the event that a <b>business</b> <b>combination</b> is not effected.|$|E

The Proposed Statement {{would eliminate the}} use of the pooling-of-interests methods to account for <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> and require the purchase method to be used to account for all <b>business</b> <b>combinations.</b> In another major change to current practice, the statement would require that goodwill be recognized as asset, and be amrtized over its useful economic life; however, the maximum amortization period would be reduced from the current 40 years to 20 years. In addition, one of objectives in the Statement is to have more intangible assets separately recognized than are currently recognized in practice. That is, the Statement requires that all reliably measurable identifiable intangible assets would be recorded separately from goodwill in the financial statement at fair value.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{determine}} the effects on taxation tied to assets valuation on the occasion of <b>business</b> <b>combinations.</b> In order to study this topic properly, after a quick view of the most popular firm evaluation methods, it has been examined how to account this kind of operations using both national and international accounting standards, giving special attention to <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> under common control. The study of <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> accounting methods is fundamental because the value and the way assets appear in the balance sheet affects directly tax revenue accordingly to Italian tax law. Therefore, it has been pointed out the tax relevance of capital gains arising from <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> such as mergers, demergers or transfers of companies, and how these operations have effects on indirect taxes like registration fee and mortgage and cadastral taxes. Afterwards, it has been examined the assessment power held by tax agencies in order to contest the determination of assets value made by taxpayers and especially the transfer pricing aspects of business restructurings carried out by associated enterprises. From this study emerged several coordination problems among domestic tax law and international transfer price guidelines issued by OECD. At last, it has been provided to highlight any similarities and differences between value configurations encountered during the dissertation, such as cost, sum due, normal value, fair value and valuations at arm’s length...|$|R
40|$|Background and Discussion: In 2002, IASB and FASB {{started working}} on a {{convergence}} project {{with the aim of}} identifying and minimizing differences between the two regulations, IFRS and US GAAP. Since 2005, when it became mandatory to prepare the financial statements in accordance with IFRS for all listed companies in the EU, goodwill has grown remarkably in Sweden but stayed rather stable in the US. Is this partly depending on differences in recognition of intangible assets in <b>business</b> <b>combinations?</b> Since the standards are similar to each other, could quality of enforcement affect accounting choices and the recognition of intangibles? Purpose and Research Questions: The purpose of this thesis is to examine if there are any significant differences in recognition of intangible assets when acquiring firms perform their purchase price allocations in <b>business</b> <b>combinations.</b> The research questions are: Are there any differences in the recognition of specific intangible assets in <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> in the US, between the examined years, and due to the characteristics of the acquiring firms, {{and the size of the}} acquisitions? Are there any significant differences in the recognition of intangible assets when comparing the US and Swedish samples? Methodology: To test for differences in recognition of intangible assets in <b>business</b> <b>combinations,</b> this thesis is approached by a deductive method of quantitative character, using secondary data. Financial data is gathered from databases and annual reports, and the hypotheses are tested with Kruskal-­‐Wallis tests and linear regression models. Results and Conclusions: The characteristics of the acquiring firm that significantly showed to affect the recognition of intangible assets were firm size, industry affiliation and technology-­‐level. Size of the acquisitions was also a significant factor. The results from the regression model showed that US firms recognizes a larger share of intangible assets in <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> than Swedish firms and we assume this is the result of stronger enforcement in the US...|$|R
40|$|Actes à paraîtreIn 2006, the China Accounting Standards Committee (CASC) {{issued its}} Statement No. 20, which permits both the {{purchase}} and pooling of interests (or merger) method of accounting for <b>business</b> <b>combinations.</b> The {{decision of the}} CASC in Statement No. 20 stands {{in contrast to the}} decisions taken by the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) which both eliminated the pooling of interests method. As a result of the issuance of CASC 20, along with similar pronouncements by the Japanese standard setters and other standards setting bodies, the goal of harmonizing international accounting standards has been faced with a lack of convergence in the area of accounting for <b>business</b> <b>combinations.</b> In this paper we examine the reasons for this lack of convergence in order to develop a reconciled framework. In particular, the Chinese standards setters have sought to develop an approach to accounting for <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> which distinguishes between instances where the combining entities are under common control or not under common control. Using a relatively narrow definition of common control, both the FASB and the IASB have excluded <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> among entities under common control from the scope of their respective pronouncements. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze the reasons for the distinctly different approach taken by the Chinese accounting standards setters by comparing the provisions of FASB 141, IFRS 3 and CASC 20. Our analysis will show that the technical differences between the standards are based on different understandings of the underlying economics of <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> (Anthony, 1987), which leads in turn to different representations of the combination process. We believe that a forthright recognition of these differences may lead to a reconsideration of the pooling of interests and merger methods in a new comprehensive framework...|$|R
