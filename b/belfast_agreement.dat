5|$|The {{substance}} of the Agreement (formally {{referred to as the}} <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement)</b> was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional Executive drawn from the major parties in a new Northern Ireland Assembly, with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a First Minister and deputy First Minister drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an independent commission supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.|$|E
5|$|A third person, former UDR soldier John James Somerville (aged 37, a lorry-helper and {{the brother}} of Wesley), was arrested {{following}} an RUC raid in Dungannon on 26 September 1980. He was charged with the Miami Showband murders, the attempted murder of Stephen Travers, and the murder of Patrick Falls in 1974. He was given {{a total of four}} life sentences (three for the murders of the Miami Showband members and one for the Falls murder) on 9 November 1981; he had pleaded not guilty. The three convicted UVF men, although admitting to having been at the scene, denied having shot anyone. None of the men ever named their accomplices, and the other UVF gunmen were never caught. The three men were sent to serve their sentence in the Maze Prison, on the outskirts of Lisburn. Fortnight Magazine reported that on 1 June 1982, John James Somerville began a hunger strike at the Maze to obtain special category status. Crozier, McDowell, and Somerville were released after 1998 {{under the terms of the}} <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement.</b>|$|E
25|$|David Trimble led {{the party}} between 1995 and 2005. His {{support for the}} <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement</b> caused a rupture within the party into pro-agreement and anti-agreement factions. Trimble served as First Minister of Northern Ireland in the power-sharing {{administration}} created under the <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since independence, the Republic of Ireland {{has enjoyed}} an {{extremely}} {{low rate of}} imprisonment {{in comparison with the}} rate when {{it was part of the}} United Kingdom. Recently, however, there has been considerable growth in its prison population. The Troubles in Northern Ireland led to a large spike in its prison population in the last third of the 20th century, which ended with the <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement's</b> early-release scheme.|$|R

25|$|At {{midnight on}} 1 December 1999, direct London rule {{came to an}} end in Northern Ireland when power was {{formally}} devolved to the new Northern Ireland Assembly. On 2 December 1999, power was devolved to the North/South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council when commencement orders for the British-Irish Agreement came into effect. However, Article 4(2) of the British-Irish Agreement (the Agreement between the British and Irish governments for the implementation of the <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement)</b> required the two governments to notify each other in writing of the completion of the requirements for the entry into force of the <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement.</b> Entry into force was to be upon the receipt of the later of the two notifications. The British government agreed to participate in a televised ceremony at Iveagh House in Dublin, the Irish department of foreign affairs. Peter Mandelson, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, attended early on 2 December 1999. He exchanged notifications with David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister. Shortly after the ceremony, at 10.30 am, the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern signed the declaration formally amending Articles 2 & 3 of the Irish Constitution. He then announced to the Dáil that the British-Irish Agreement had entered into force (including certain supplementary agreements concerning the <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement).</b>|$|E
25|$|The long-running Northern Ireland {{peace process}} {{was brought to}} a {{conclusion}} in 1998 with the <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement</b> which established a devolved Northern Ireland Assembly and de-escalated the violence associated with the Troubles. It was signed in April 1998 by the British and Irish governments and was endorsed by all the main political parties in Northern Ireland {{with the exception of}} Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party. Voters in Northern Ireland approved the agreement in a referendum in May 1998 and it came into force in December 1999. In August 1998, a car-bomb exploded in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh, killing 29 people and injuring 220. The attack was carried out by the Real Irish Republican Army who opposed the <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement.</b> It was reported in 2005, that the IRA had renounced violence and had ditched its entire arsenal.|$|E
5000|$|Since the 90s Watson has {{had many}} {{exhibitions}} across Ireland and in England, New York, and {{has contributed to}} joint exhibitions in many other countries. A notable piece of his art is the Hands of History sculpture. [...] For this sculpture he managed to cast in bronze {{the hands of the}} political leaders who negotiated the Good Friday <b>Agreement</b> (<b>Belfast</b> Peace <b>Agreement).</b> Those cast are: David Trimble, Ulster Unionist Party, Gerry Adams Sinn Féin, John Hume Social Democratic Labour Party, Malachy Curran N.I.Labour Party, Monica McWilliams N.I. Women's Coalition, David Irvin Progressive Unionist Party, Gary McMicheal Ulster Democratic Party, Seán Neeson Alliance Party. The British Government is represented by Mo Mowlam the then Secretary of State. This sculpture is a unique historical record of the aspirations of the Agreement, designed to create a blueprint for a better future in between all conflicted parties in Ireland.|$|R
25|$|Trimble {{at first}} opposed the {{appointment}} of former U.S. Senator George J. Mitchell {{as the chairman of}} multi-party talks, but eventually accepted him. The talks resulted in the <b>Belfast</b> (Good Friday) <b>Agreement</b> (GFA) of April 1998. Trimble was subsequently seen as instrumental in getting his party to accept the accord.|$|R
40|$|This study explores family {{relations}} in the Protestant/Loyalist Fountain enclave in Derry/Londonderry in Northern Ireland after the <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreements.</b> The Fountain is an interface area characterized by physical boundaries, tied family and community life and {{a high rate of}} violent incidents. This study focuses on youngsters and looks at family ties, socialization and the transmission of boundaries and (violent) attitudes and behaviour towards the other community in a post-war enclave context. Transmission was analyzed from a discursive approach and the study looks at the reproduction and meaning of discourses and practices and the differences and similarities between family members. Interviews were conducted with family members of three generations from five families living in the Fountain. The results showed a wide variety of attitudes, opinions and behaviours with regard to inter-community relations within families and between generations. Families {{played an important role in}} the confirmation and conceptualization of boundaries but not in the way boundaries were dealt with. No evidence was found of transmission of sectarianism and radical attitudes and behaviours within families. Parents showed ambivalent cues with regard to the acceptability of violence. Motives for youth violence were not conflict related per se. Youth agency, personal experiences, social disadvantage and extra-family spheres of influence as peer groups, social networks and paramilitaries appeared to be important in the development of violent behaviour...|$|R
25|$|The idea of electing a {{consultative body}} to thrash {{out a deal}} for {{devolution}} was also retained and in 1996 it was revived when the Northern Ireland Forum was elected on largely the same lines and with the same overall purpose. The Forum formed part of a process {{that led to the}} <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement</b> and the Northern Ireland Assembly.|$|E
25|$|When Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) {{became the}} largest parties, {{by the terms}} of the <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement</b> no deal could be made without the support of both parties. They nearly reached a deal in November 2004, but the DUP insisted on {{photographic}} and/or video evidence that decommissioning had been carried out, which was unacceptable to Sinn Féin.|$|E
25|$|The talks {{led to the}} Good Friday Agreement of 10 April 1998 (officially {{known as}} the <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement),</b> which set up an {{inclusive}} devolved government in the North, and altered the Dublin government's constitutional claim to the whole island in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland. Republicans opposed to the direction taken by Sinn Féin {{in the peace process}} formed the 32 County Sovereignty Movement in the late 1990s.|$|E

25|$|All signatories to the <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement</b> also declare their {{acceptance}} of the 'principle of consent' (i.e. {{that there will be}} no change to the constitutional position of Northern Ireland unless a majority votes for it), and Unionists argued that this provision amounts to recognising that the Union Flag is the only legitimate official flag in Northern Ireland. The problem was discussed in detail and various proposals made including suggestions for a new flag.|$|E
25|$|On 28 August 1996, the UDA's South Belfast Brigadier Alex Kerr, {{and head}} of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade Billy Wright, were {{expelled}} from the Combined Loyalist Military Command and ordered to leave Northern Ireland after the pair had lent their support to a campaign against the <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement</b> in general and the Progressive Unionist Party and Ulster Democratic Party in particular. The campaign was being led by former UDA hitman and Ulster Independence Movement member Pastor Kenny McClinton.|$|E
25|$|In Northern Ireland, the Conservatives {{suspended}} the parliament in 1973 {{in the wake}} of the growing Troubles, and made unsuccessful attempts to re-establish it in the same year, and in 1982. They supported the <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement</b> negotiated by the Blair government in 1998, and in 2009, negotiated an electoral pact with the declining Ulster Unionist Party, whom it had previously been allied to before 1973 and informally during the John Major's tenure as Prime Minister. The pact was abandoned for the 2015 general election, where the Northern Ireland Conservatives ran their own candidates.|$|E
5000|$|Since 1995, Mitchell {{has been}} active in the Northern Ireland peace process, having served as the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland under President Bill Clinton. He first led a {{commission}} that established the principles on non-violence to which all parties in Northern Ireland had to adhere and subsequently chaired the all-party peace negotiations, which led to the <b>Belfast</b> Peace <b>Agreement</b> signed on Good Friday 1998 (known since as the [...] "Good Friday Agreement"). Mitchell's personal intervention with the parties was crucial {{to the success of the}} talks. He was succeeded as special envoy by Richard Haass.|$|R
50|$|The NIWC {{was founded}} by Catholic {{academic}} Monica McWilliams and Protestant social worker Pearl Sagar to contest elections to the Northern Ireland Forum, the body for all-party talks {{which led to the}} <b>Belfast</b> (Good Friday) <b>Agreement.</b> The party campaigned principally around {{the fact that it was}} led by women, declining to take a position on whether Northern Ireland should be part of the United Kingdom or a United Ireland.|$|R
40|$|New Beginnings" covers Irish {{constitutional}} {{development from}} Home Rule to the Good Friday Agreement, focusing on turning points where radical constitutional change was discussed, attempted, or implemented. It asks what Irish constitution-makers {{were trying to}} do in drafting constitutional documents, or significantly amending existing constitutions. It deals with the 1919, 1922, and 1937 constitutions, debates over the 1937 constitution since 1969, and the 1998 <b>Belfast</b> peace <b>agreement.</b> Taking the relationship between constitutionalism and democracy as its key issue, it asks why Irish politicians have seen constitutions as ways of making democracy more manageable, rather than of furthering democracy. It is intended for students of politics and constitutional law, as well as the general reader, and written in an accessible style that assumes no prior knowledge of Irish constitutional history or law...|$|R
25|$|At the 2003 {{election}} the DUP {{became the}} largest party. As it opposed the <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement,</b> {{there was no}} prospect of the assembly voting for the First and deputy First Ministers. Therefore, the British Government did not restore power to the Assembly and the elected members never met. Instead there commenced a protracted series of negotiations. During these negotiations a legally separate assembly, known as The Assembly consisting of the members elected in 2003 was formed in May 2006 to enable the parties to negotiate and to prepare for government.|$|E
25|$|SDLP leader John Hume, MP, {{identified}} {{the possibility that}} a negotiated settlement might be possible and began secret talks with Adams in 1988. These discussions led to unofficial contacts with the British Northern Ireland Office under the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Brooke, and with the government of the Republic under Charles Haughey– although both governments maintained in public that they would not negotiate with terrorists. These talks provided the groundwork for what was later to be the <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement,</b> preceded by the milestone Downing Street Declaration and the Joint Framework Document.|$|E
25|$|The Irish Government {{was bound}} {{by the terms of}} the 1998 Good Friday (<b>Belfast)</b> <b>Agreement</b> to submit Articles 2 and 3 to {{amendment}} by referendum. To this end, the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution was adopted in June of the same year by 94% of those voting. The new wording describes the Irish nation as a community of individuals with a common identity rather than as a territory, and is intended to reassure unionists that a united Ireland will not come about without a majority of the Northern Ireland electorate declaring in favour of such a move.|$|E
50|$|The first {{government}} of Northern Ireland was the Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland, which exercised such authority from 1922 to 1972. A Northern Ireland Executive was created following {{the signing of}} the Sunningdale Agreement in 1974, while the current Northern Ireland Executive under the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, was created in the <b>Belfast</b> (Good Friday) <b>Agreement,</b> and has intermittently been in existence from 1999 to the present. Northern Ireland has also been governed by ministers under the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland during periods of Direct Rule.|$|R
5000|$|The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) is a non-departmental {{public body}} funded through the Northern Ireland Office but {{operating}} independently of government {{as the national}} human rights institution (NHRI) for Northern Ireland. It came into existence on 1 March 1999, having been created by the Parliament of the United Kingdom through section 68 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, in compliance with a commitment made by the UK Government in the <b>Belfast</b> (Good Friday) <b>Agreement</b> of 10 April 1998. Its powers were amended by the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Belfast</b> (Good Friday) <b>Agreement</b> 1998 {{resulted}} in the return of devolved government to Northern Ireland and, with it, {{a decision by the}} Executive and Assembly to conduct a radical review of public administration. As the review reaches its final stages this paper considers the likely outcomes. It argues that the parameters of the review will limit its impact and describes the reform proposals as structural changes or administrative rationalisation, devoid of a wider modernising approach to improving public services. The on/off nature of devolution could result in ‘one of the major tasks for devolved government’ (according to the Northern Ireland Executive) being implemented by Direct Rule minister...|$|R
25|$|On 28 July 2005, the Provisional IRA {{declared}} {{an end to}} its campaign and has since decommissioned what {{is thought to be}} all of its arsenal. This final act of decommissioning was performed in accordance with the <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement</b> of 1998, and under the watch of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning and two external church witnesses. Many unionists, however, remain sceptical. The International Commission later confirmed that the main loyalist paramilitary groups, the UDA, UVF and the Red Hand Commando, had decommissioned what is thought to be all of their arsenals, witnessed by a former archbishop and a former top civil servant.|$|E
25|$|After the United Kingdom general election, 1997, the new Labour {{government}} had {{a majority in}} the House of Commons and was not reliant on unionist votes. The subsequent dropping of the insistence led to another IRA ceasefire, as part of the negotiations strategy, which saw teams from the British and Irish governments, the UUP, the SDLP, Sinn Féin and representatives of loyalist paramilitary organisations, under the chairmanship of former United States Senator George Mitchell, produce the <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement</b> (also called the Good Friday Agreement as it was signed on Good Friday, 1998). Under the Agreement, structures were created reflecting the Irish and British identities of the people of Ireland, creating a British-Irish Council and a Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly.|$|E
25|$|Northern Ireland {{currently}} {{has a number}} of pro-union political parties, the largest of which is the traditionalist Democratic Unionist Party led by Arlene Foster, followed by the more moderate Ulster Unionist Party led by Robin Swann. Both parties are active across Northern Ireland. On a smaller level, the Progressive Unionist Party, which is the political wing of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) paramilitary group, attracts some support in the greater Belfast area. Traditional Unionist Voice is opposed to the current constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland following the <b>Belfast</b> <b>Agreement</b> and St Andrews Agreement. The pluralist Conservative Party is currently allied to the Ulster Unionist Party. While the Alliance Party supports the status quo position of Northern Ireland, it does not define itself as Unionist.|$|E
50|$|The Irish Human Rights Commission (IHRC) was {{a public}} body, state-funded but {{independent}} of government, that promoted and protected {{human rights in the}} Republic of Ireland. It was established in 2000 by an Act of the Oireachtas (the Irish parliament). As one of the two national human rights institutions (NHRIs) on the island of Ireland, like the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) its creation was a consequence of the <b>Belfast</b> (Good Friday) <b>Agreement</b> of 10 April 1998. It was required to maintain a joint committee with the NIHRC to consider human rights issues affecting both jurisdictions, such as a possible Charter of Rights for the Island of Ireland.|$|R
40|$|Devolution in Northern Ireland {{followed}} {{directly from}} the 1998 <b>Belfast</b> (Good Friday) <b>Agreement</b> which provided, inter alia, for a democratically elected Assembly "inclusive in its membership, capable of exercising executive and legislative authority, and subject to safeguards {{to protect the rights}} and interests of all sides of the community". More than six years on, the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly are in suspension for the fourth time (the latest since October 2002). The conjunction of devolution and the implementation of the Agreement mean that the former is wholly dependent on the vagaries of the latter and, as a consequence, has devalued the potential of devolution to improve the governance of Northern Ireland. ...|$|R
40|$|The (<b>Belfast)</b> Good Friday <b>Agreement</b> {{represents}} a major milestone in Northern Ireland's recent political history, with complex conditions allowing for {{formation of a}} ‘cross-community’ system of government enabling power sharing between parties representing Protestant/loyalist and Catholic/nationalist constituencies. This article examines the apparent flourishing of community-focused digital practices over the subsequent ‘post-conflict’ decade, galvanised by Northern Irish and EU policy initiatives armed with consolidating the peace process. Numerous digital heritage and storytelling projects have been catalysed within programmes aiming to foster social processes, community cohesion and cross-community exchange. The article outlines two projects—‘digital memory boxes’ and ‘interactive galleon’—developed during 2007 – 2008 within practice-led PhD enquiry conducted {{in collaboration with the}} Nerve Centre, a third-sector media education organisation. The article goes on to critically examine the processes involved in practically realising, and creatively and theoretically reconciling, community-engaged digital production in a particular socio-political context of academic-community collaboration...|$|R
