40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of politics on the budgeting process within the fertiliser manufacturing industry in Indonesia. Prior budgeting {{studies have focused on}} one of the following three theoretical frameworks - economic, psychological, and social. This study expands the research corpus by assessing the effect of politics on the budgeting process. The objectives of this study arc: (a) to investigate the effect of politics in the relationship between managerial roles and budgeting process – budgetary participation, budgetary communication, and budgetary control including <b>budgetary</b> <b>monitoring</b> and budgetary evaluation, and (b) {{to assess the impact of}} structural and individual power on the budgeting process. The study uses a mixed research methodology survey method supplemented by interviews. The survey questionnaire is adapted from previous studies. The sample for this study consists of four fertiliser-manufacturing enterprises in the state owned sector of Indonesia. The respondents of the survey questionnaire were middle managers responsible for unit budgets in the sample companies. Respondents were asked to rate on a seven-point scale their agreement or disagreement with issues concerning the budgeting process, managerial roles and politics. Survey interviews, based on the questionnaire, were developed for a select group of respondents, consisting of middle and senior managers. The results of the study, both survey questionnaire and interviews, indicate that politics has significant influence on the budgeting process. Further, it showed that the influence appeared different, depending whether structural or individual power is involved. The major implications of this study centre on the strong moderating effect of politics on the relationship between the budgeting process and managerial roles: this seems to be a relevant construct and should be developed further. Hopefully, the study will advance the thinking of scholars in this area and create interest in replicating this method of analysis and validating the findings. The conceptual model should also be applied to the role of politics on the budgeting process in other industries to assess the external validity of the model...|$|E

40|$|The {{system of}} {{budgetary}} control includes {{a variety of}} procedures, obligations and instruments which lead to change the workplace and offer better services and goods. The budgetary control process is compromised of budgeting, planning, controlling and evaluating, which provides a formal basis for monitoring and controlling, towards {{the achievement of the}} objectives specified in the budgeting and planning stages, thus providing evaluating and makes auditing as a component part in the process which is necessary {{to be able to make}} corrections to current operations and activities in order to meet the original objectives and plans. Furthermore, accountability is an essential element of good governance so the need for accountability and efficiency of service delivery in public organizations, put‟s public organizations at the fore front in establishment of control systems. Hence it is necessary to explore the factors that determine and impact accountability in the public sector. This paper presents the relationships between <b>budgetary</b> control, planning, <b>monitoring</b> and controlling, auditing, and integrity with accountability in the public sector and their impact on accountability in the public sector is examined...|$|R

However, the implementation of {{monitoring and evaluation}} in the Ghanaian construction industry have seen numerous challenges and as a result, the poor performance of the industry. This paper identifies and evaluates the barriers faced by projects {{in the implementation of}} monitoring and evaluation in the Ghanaian construction industry. Literature was reviewed and subsequently, a semi-structured questionnaire developed to stimulate the relevant response from the major stakeholders in the Ghanaian construction industry. The collected data were analysed using the one sample t-test. Literature revealed ten (10) challenging factors to the implementation of monitoring and evaluation. Weak institutional capacity, limited resources and <b>budgetary</b> allocations for <b>monitoring</b> & evaluation, weak linkage between planning, budgeting and monitoring & evaluation, weak demand for and utilisation of monitoring and evaluation results and finally, poor data quality, data gaps and inconsistencies were identified as the most significant contributing factors to the implementation of PM&E in Ghana construction projects. The study contributes to the body of knowledge on the challenges to effective monitoring and evaluation of construction projects...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{and other}} global change {{phenomena}} affecting biodiversity require monitoring to track ecosystem changes and guide policy and management actions. Designing a biodiversity monitoring {{program is a}} difficult task that requires making decisions that often lack consensus due to <b>budgetary</b> constrains. As <b>monitoring</b> programs require long-term investment, they also require strong and continuing support from all interested parties. As such, stakeholder consultation is key to identify priorities and make sound design decisions that have as much support as possible. Here, we present {{the results of a}} consultation conducted to serve as an aid for designing a large-scale biodiversity monitoring program for the province of Québec (Canada). The consultation took the form of a survey with 13 discrete choices involving tradeoffs in respect to design priorities and 10 demographic questions (e. g., age, profession). The survey was sent to thousands of individuals having expected interests and knowledge about biodiversity and was completed by 621 participants. Overall, consensuses were few and it appeared difficult to create a design fulfilling the priorities of the majority. Most participants wanted 1) a monitoring design covering the entire territory and focusing on natural habitats; 2) a focus on species related to ecosystem services, on threatened and on invasive species. The only demographic characteristic that was related to the type of prioritization was the declared level of knowledge in biodiversity (null to high), but even then the influence was quite small...|$|R
40|$|Plague {{which is}} the {{zoonosis}} quarantine disease remains occur in Pasuruan Regency. Plague suspect was still found until year 2013. Plague surveillance that still actively conducted in Pasuruan Regency is probably the only one plague surveillance in Indonesia. Plague surveillance consist of human and rodent surveillance. Evaluation of surveillance system is needed to improve its quality, efficiency, and usefulness. This research aimed to assess the quality of plague surveillance system in Pasuruan Regency year 2014 based on attributes which are simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, data quality, sensitivity, predictive value positive, representativeness, timeliness, and stability. The research design was evaluation study. Subjecct was plague surveillance system in Pasuruan Regency year 2014. Data were collected by interviews, observations, and document study. The obtained data and information were compared to the guidelines and recent theories then presented in narrations, tables, and figures. The research showed that the surveillance system was simple and flexible, lack of data quality and acceptability, unmeasurable sensitivity and predictive value positive, low representativeness and timeliness, and high stability. This research concluded that quality of plague surveillance system in Pasuruan Regency based on its attributes was not good enough. The suggestion given are conduct training, supply a sufficient <b>budgetary</b> fund, do <b>monitoring</b> and evaluation periodically, disseminate information to another program and sector, also to the community, send surveillance report by e-mail, use spreadsheet software for surveillance rodent reporting, improve the report by including information about damage serum, serum less than the total of captured rodent, and report about the missing trap...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Evidence on {{interventions}} for preventing unhealthy weight gain in adolescents is urgently needed. The {{aim of this}} paper is to describe the process evaluation for a three-year (2005 - 2008) project conducted in five secondary schools in the East Geelong/Bellarine region of Victoria, Australia. The project, 'It's Your Move!' aimed to reduce unhealthy weight gain by promoting healthy eating patterns, regular physical activity, healthy body weight, and body size perception amongst youth; and improve the capacity of families, schools, and community organisations to sustain the promotion of healthy eating and physical activity in the region. Methods The project was supported by Deakin University (training and evaluation), a Reference Committee (strategic direction, <b>budgetary</b> approval and <b>monitoring)</b> and a Project Management Committee (project delivery). A workshop of students, teachers and other stakeholders formulated a 10 -point action plan, which was then translated into strategies and initiatives specific to each school by the School Project Officers (staff members released from teaching duties one day per week) and trained Student Ambassadors. Baseline surveys informed intervention development. Process data were collected on all intervention activities and these were collated and enumerated, where possible, into a set of mutually exclusive tables to demonstrate the types of strategies and the dose, frequency and reach of intervention activities. Results The action plan included three guiding objectives, four on nutrition, two on physical activity and one on body image. The process evaluation data showed that a mix of intervention strategies were implemented, including social marketing, one-off events, lunch time and curriculum programs, improvements in infrastructure, and healthy school food policies. The majority of the interventions were implemented in schools and focused on capacity building and healthy eating strategies as physical activity practices were seen by the teachers as already meeting students' needs. Conclusions While substantial health-promoting activities were conducted (especially related to healthy eating), there remain further opportunities for secondary schools to use a whole-of-school approach through the school curriculum, environment, policies and ethos to improve healthy eating, physical activity and healthy body perceptions in youth. To achieve this, significant, sustained leadership will be required within the education sector generally and within schools specifically. </p...|$|R

40|$|A major {{difficulty}} of teaching public health {{to students in}} a Masters Program is conveying the need for taking a strategic approach to situations. Tackling real-life public health issues is rather complex. There will generally {{be a number of}} avenues of investigation and it is necessary to be wary of the short and long-term consequences of actions. Also time and money need to be managed effectively. As one approach to the education of students about these issues, a computer-based package has been developed which simulates the investigation of a real public health problem. This simulation enables students to encounter such issues in a risk-free environment, and to carry out their own investigations and propose their own solutions to the problems presented. Specifically, students have to clarify the impact of pollution on the health of residents in an affected area. They will collect and analyse data (from in-built real-life data sets), design and analyse their own epidemiological study and present their findings as reports, press-releases and presentations. The task takes students an entire subject (14 -weeks) to complete and is largely self-directed. The package contains both quantitative data, such as mortality and morbidity statistics, and qualitative data, such as the outcome of interviews with key stakeholders. The package also exploits the multimedia capabilities of a PC by incorporating maps and photographs of the polluted area. This enables students to undertake a virtual trip, and thus pick up vital clues about potential sources of contamination. The package provides links to standard statistical software, thereby giving students an opportunity to become more familiar with programs they are likely to use in real-life. The data provide sufficient breadth and detail for students to use various strategies. But, to simulate real-life, students have to conduct their investigations within virtual time and <b>budgetary</b> constraints, continuously <b>monitored</b> by the computer program. In particular, monitoring of constraints, the real-life data and the linked use of standard software allow for the realistic development of essential skills. In the subject setting, role-play during the presentations, and reporting in real-life formats, add to the simulation. Practical exercises have not been part of most Public Health Masters programs world wide, and yet the complexity of real-life situations means that such experience is invaluable. When fully complete, this package will offer a novel, innovative and important approach to the teaching of this aspect of public health...|$|R
40|$|Obesity is common, {{serious and}} costly. Substantial {{evidence}} has linked diet, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors to obesity, and {{these factors are}} significantly influenced by the environment. Certain worksites like healthcare settings are linked to higher obesity rates in their employees. Despite the obesity risk that hospital employees face, little is known of the current impact of worksite wellness programs targeting nutrition, physical activity and sedentary behaviors in a healthcare set up. ^ The overall aim of this dissertation was to assess worksite wellness strategies focused on diet and physical activity on the prevention of obesity in hospital employees. The first paper of this dissertation presented {{the results of a}} systematic review of the literature between 2000 – 2016, and identified 30 worksite wellness programs (eight randomized control trials, six cluster randomized control trials, and sixteen quasi-experimental studies) focused on nutrition and physical activity for obesity prevention in health care settings (hospitals, clinics, nursing homes). The findings indicated {{that a majority of the}} studies focused on changing diet and physical activity behaviors using behavioral and educational intervention strategies. Multicomponent intervention including behavioral and environmental component fared better than only environmental approaches. Cognitive/behavioral and educational strategies fared better than only educational strategies. While studies included in this review showed evidence that worksite wellness programs have the potential to improve weight outcomes in healthcare employees, there is still a need for well-designed studies with large sample size to demonstrate effectiveness of worksite strategies in preventing obesity in healthcare employees. ^ The second paper of this dissertation evaluated pre-to-post changes of an environmental and social marketing obesity prevention intervention, on the hospital’s nutrition, physical activity environment, and organizational policies and practices using a validated Environment Assessment Tool (EAT) in six hospitals (five intervention, one control) in Houston, Texas. This study also assessed, using key informant interviews, management support, organizational engagement, alignment of the intervention with the organizational objectives and its impact on implementation and sustainability of the intervention in the participating hospitals. A mixed method, sequential explanatory analysis approach was used to analyze secondary data from the Shape Up Houston (SUH) study (EAT survey), and primary data from key informant interviews. Results indicated that only one out of five hospitals demonstrated significant post intervention changes (P=. 004) when all subscales were included in the analysis (organizational characteristics, physical activity support, food and nutrition support). Lessons learned included the importance of continued organizational engagement and leadership support, resource allocation (space, <b>budgetary,</b> staff), frequent <b>monitoring</b> and regular follow up of the program components by the program staff, and partnership between wellness staff and departments like vending/cafeteria contractors for the implementation and sustainability of environmental changes for obesity prevention in healthcare settings. ...|$|R
