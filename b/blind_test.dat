25|$|Inferences about regoliths from phase curves are {{frequently}} based on Hapke parameterization. However, in a <b>blind</b> <b>test</b> M. Shepard and P. Helfenstein found no {{strong evidence that}} {{a particular set of}} Hapke parameters derived from photometric data could uniquely reveal the physical state of laboratory samples. These tests included modeling the three-term Henyey-Greenstein phase functions and the coherent backscatter opposition effect. This negative finding suggests that the radiative transfer model developed by B. Hapke may be inadequate for physical modeling based on photometry.|$|E

2500|$|A further, {{relevant}} {{difference was}} the deletion of the <b>blind</b> <b>test,</b> {{considered by some}} scholars as the very foundation of the scientific method.

2500|$|One study {{published}} in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol concluded that high doses (0.28mg/kg) of thujone in alcohol had negative effects on attention performance in a clinical setting. It delayed reaction time, and caused subjects to concentrate their attention into the central field of vision. Low doses (0.028mg/kg) did not produce an effect noticeably different from the plain alcohol control. While the effects of the high dose samples were statistically significant in a double <b>blind</b> <b>test,</b> the test subjects themselves were unable to reliably identify which samples contained thujone. For the average [...] man, the high dose samples in the study would equate to 18.2mg of thujone. The EU limit of 35mg/L of thujone in absinthe means that given the highest permitted thujone content, that individual would need to consume approximately 0.5 litres of high proof (e.g. 50%+ ABV) spirit before the thujone could be metabolized in order to display effects detectable in a clinical setting, which would result in a potentially lethal BAC of >0.4%.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryTravis O’QuinnThe {{objectives}} {{of these studies}} were to determine how consumer palatability ratings of beef strip loin steaks and ground beef are affected when products are identified with a brand, USDA grade, or product type. Strip loins were selected to represent five quality levels and six ground beef treatments were chosen, representing a variety of fat levels and product types. After aging steaks for 14 d and ground beef for 8 d, 2. 5 cm steaks and 151. 2 g patties were formed. Consumer panelists evaluated samples for tenderness, juiciness, flavor liking, and overall liking as well as texture liking for ground beef samples. Additionally, consumers rated each palatability trait as either acceptable or unacceptable and rated the sample as either unsatisfactory, everyday quality, better than everyday quality, or premium quality. Samples were fed in two rounds – <b>blind</b> and informed <b>testing.</b> In {{the first round of}} <b>blind</b> <b>testing,</b> consumers were served one sample from each treatment with treatments not disclosed. For the second round of informed testing, USDA grade, or product information was disclosed prior to sampling. Samples evaluated by consumers were paired for <b>blind</b> and informed <b>testing.</b> During <b>blind</b> <b>testing,</b> Certified Angus Beef (CAB) steaks rated similar (P > 0. 05) to Choice for all palatability traits; however CAB rated greater (P 0. 05) when <b>tested</b> <b>blind,</b> but Angus Select was rated greater (P 0. 05) in ratings for palatability traits when brand was informed. Multiple traits were rated greater for Prime, CAB, and Angus Select products indicating these products received a "brand lift" (change in ratings due to brand knowledge) in palatability due to brand identification. However, when brand information was disclosed for Choice and Select steaks, consumers indicated no increase in palatability perception. Few differences were observed in <b>blind</b> <b>testing</b> for ground beef; however, during informed testing, 90 / 10 CAB ground sirloin rated greater (P < 0. 05) than all other products for all palatability traits besides juiciness. Increased (P < 0. 05) ratings were found for CAB products for multiple traits while the only non-branded product that received increased (P < 0. 05) ratings was 90 / 10 ground beef during informed testing. There were few differences among ground beef products when <b>tested</b> <b>blind,</b> indicating that during <b>blind</b> <b>testing,</b> brand, fat percentage, and subprimal source have little effect on ground beef palatability. However, when product and brand were identified, multiple treatments received increased ratings for palatability traits indicating branding and product type knowledge influence the palatability of ground beef...|$|R
