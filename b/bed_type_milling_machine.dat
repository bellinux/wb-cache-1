40|$|Abstract––Milling is a {{metal removal}} process {{by means of}} using a {{rotating}} cutter having one or more cutting teeth. A <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> is a machine tool used to <b>machine</b> solid materials. <b>Milling</b> <b>machines</b> are often classed in two basic forms horizontal and vertical. This refers to {{the orientation of the}} main spindle. At all <b>types</b> of <b>milling</b> <b>machines,</b> the cutting tool performs a rotational motion that is the cutting motion. The rotation axis of the tool could be horizontal or vertical, depending on machine tool version. The feeding motion is achieved either by part or tool, or both; usually on three perpendicular directions. <b>Milling</b> <b>machine</b> is automated using Electro pneumatic system. Milling process is the second most common method (after turning) for metal cutting and especially for the finishing of Machined parts. In modern industry the goal is to manufacture low cost, high quality products in short time. Keywords––Milling, Electro pneumatic, cutting tool, cutter, automated. I...|$|R
40|$|Since {{processes}} of machine tool design are rather experience basis, the design procedures of machine tools {{need to be}} more effective and helpful to shorten the time-to-market. It is said that design review at the early stage is the key issue to make the design effective. The series of the research including this paper is trying to propose and verify a new design tool which can support the decision making of a machine tool designer by providing a method of design review. This paper applied a design tool which was proposed by the author to a new machine tool design procedure having wide range of design variations. The tool combined the form-shaping theory which is a well-known mathematical expression method of cutting motions of machine tools, to the Taguchi method which is also a well-known robust design tool. The tool was effective in identifying the effects of machine tool structures, design parameters and error sources on machine performance. Since the tool can identify which factors are critical to machine tool performance and which are not, machine tool designer can tighten critical tolerance of machine components and loosen non-effective tolerance. The paper applied the procedure to example designs of <b>milling</b> <b>machines,</b> and clarified characteristics of two different design concepts. One is a single column <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> and the other is a gantry <b>type</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine.</b> the design tool can compare the overall performance of the two machines. It was also possible to clarify which design parameter is the most critical one for the performance of each machine respectively, and what is the key component to be tightened its tolerance to improve accuracy of the machine tool. By these information, the paper concludes that the design tool is useful in design review of machine tools. 1...|$|R

50|$|Samuel Bentham {{developed}} a shaper between 1791 and 1793. However, Roe (1916) credits James Nasmyth with {{the invention of}} the shaper in 1836. Shapers were very common in industrial production from the mid-19th century through the mid-20th. In current industrial practice, shapers have been largely superseded by other machine tools (especially of the CNC <b>type),</b> including <b>milling</b> <b>machines,</b> grinding machines, and broaching machines. But the basic function of a shaper is still sound; tooling for them is minimal and very cheap to reproduce; and they are simple and robust in construction, making their repair and upkeep easily achievable. Thus they are still popular in many machine shops, from jobbing shops or repair shops to tool and die shops, where only one or a few pieces are required to be produced and the alternative methods are cost- or tooling-intensive. They also have considerable retro appeal to many hobbyist machinists, who are happy to obtain a used shaper or, in some cases, even to build a new one from scratch.|$|R
