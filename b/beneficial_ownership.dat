500|$|The {{company was}} {{constantly}} emphasizing its stock price. Management was compensated extensively using stock options, {{similar to other}} U.S. companies. This policy of stock option awards caused management to create expectations of rapid growth in efforts to {{give the appearance of}} reported earnings to meet Wall Street's expectations. The stock ticker was located in lobbies, elevators, and on company computers. At budget meetings, Skilling would develop target earnings by asking [...] "What earnings do you need to keep our stock price up?" [...] and that number would be used, even if it was not feasible. On December 31, 2000, Enron had 96 million shares outstanding as stock option plans (approximately 13% of common shares outstanding).

These critics of the flag {{of convenience}} system argue that many of the FOC flag states lack the resources or the will to properly monitor and control those vessels. The Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) contends that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) vessels use flags of convenience to avoid fisheries regulations and controls. Flags of convenience help reduce the operating costs associated with illegal fishing methods, and help illegal operators avoid prosecution and hide <b>beneficial</b> <b>ownership.</b> As a result, flags of convenience perpetuate IUU fishing which has extensive environmental, social and economic impacts, particularly in developing countries. The EJF is campaigning to end the granting of flags of convenience to fishing vessels as an effective measure to combat IUU fishing.|$|E

30|$|Even {{though the}} {{challenges}} of translational research are widely recognized, conceptual frameworks and methods/tools {{to address these issues}} are still being developed [1, 6 – 8]. Applying participatory research methods and principles to translational research has been identified as a promising approach to overcome the “translational roadblocks” [6]. Hebert et al. [8] argue that community-based participatory research, translational research and interdisciplinary research share both philosophical underpinnings and practical means for applying and sharing knowledge and techniques. Engaging multiple disciplines including academic and non-academic partners where each one contributes their expertise from the initiation of the research design phase can be <b>beneficial</b> to foster <b>ownership,</b> capacity building and empowerment of academic and non-academic partners [6, 9]. Riley et al. [10] highlights that, although broad stakeholder engagement may seem counterintuitive as a strategy to speed research, investment in this area has the potential to improve recruitment, make the activity and the outcomes of research more relevant to more stakeholders and ultimately facilitate the adoption of research findings by practitioners [10].|$|R
40|$|Economic {{prescriptions}} for the sustainable management of fisheries have typically been {{framed in the}} context of commercial fisheries. Fishery management failures have been characterized as a consequence of disjointedness between individually rational decisions and globally sensible outcomes—the “tragedy of the commons. ” The solutions proposed by economists flow from the insight that rational self-interest can lead to socially <b>beneficial</b> outcomes when <b>ownership</b> is secure and prices reflect the opportunity cost of resource use. Theoretical and empirical analyses have demonstrated that sole ownership, individual quotas, territorial use rights, fishing cooperatives, and common property management regimes can promote biologically and economically sustainable fisheries. Nevertheless, implementation of these “solutions” has met with resistance, {{due in part to the}} impossibility of uncoupling species within ecological systems and conflict between the proposed solutions and broadly accepted concepts of social justice. The problem of devising a sustainable management strategy is exacerbated in fisheries with diverse consumptive and non-consumptive users. An empirically based simulation-optimization model is used to characterize the biological and economic effects of alternative management regimes in a fishery with commercial and sport fishers. The results are generalized to the case of additional use and nonuse values. ...|$|R

5000|$|TRUST ESTATE AS BUSINESS COMPANIES. A {{practice}} {{originating in}} Massachusetts of vesting a business or certain {{real estate in}} a group of trustees, who manage it {{for the benefit of the}} <b>beneficial</b> owners; the <b>ownership</b> of the latter is evidenced by negotiable (or transferable) shares. The trustees are elected by the shareholders, or in case of a vacancy, by the board of trustees. Provision is made in the agreement and declaration of the trust to the effect that when new trustees are elected, the trust estate shall vest in them without further conveyance. The declaration of the trust specifies the power of the trustees. They have a common seal; the board is organized with the usual officers of a board of trustees; it is governed by -laws; the officers have the usual powers of like corporation officers; so far as practicable, the trustees in their collective capacity, are to carry on the business under a specified name. The trustees may also hold shares as beneficiaries. Provision may be made for the alteration or specified manner. In Eliot v. Freeman, 31 Sup. Ct. 360, 220 U.S. 178, 55 L.

40|$|The banking {{sector is}} central to the economy, but has {{recurrent}} dysfunctions. Following the Global Financial Crisis of 2007 - 2009, regulators have attempted to reform governance in banks. However, previous empirical studies on the effects of governance structures have important gaps. Using an econometric framework with novel simultaneous equations models and new dependent variables, I investigate whether corporate governance and ownership have significant effects on bank risk and performance. I employ a novel data set combining financial data from the Bankscope database with governance and ownership data collected painstakingly by hand from annual reports and Basel Pillar 3 disclosures of UK banks over the period 2003 - 2012. My findings are supported by interpretation of relevant literature and are summarised as follows (stated along with policy implications in parentheses for which features of banking should be encouraged, based on normative assumptions stated in section 9. 3). My work shows that the effects of a particular ownership or governance structure {{can be attributed to the}} ways in which categories of decision-maker within the bank are empowered by that structure, and that factors relating to information processing capability have important effects. Mutual and foreign ownership each have negative effects on risk and return because of managerial incentives and information asymmetries, respectively, without either affecting provision of investment to the wider economy. A foreign parent also increases the probability of bank failure (implying mutuality is socially <b>beneficial</b> while foreign <b>ownership</b> is not). A higher NED ratio reduces the probability of bank failure, as does having a remuneration committee, because of greater accounting for risk in decisions (implying they are desirable). The presence of an independent Chairman increases risk because it weakens CEO accountability and confuses decision-making (implying it is undesirable). An independent CRO (as a full Board member) may have similar effects. A higher proportion of Directors with no previous financial services experience increases both returns and the probability of failure because of weaker use of information (implying it is undesirable). Permission to use IRB models lowers risk and return because it provides information to empower risk-averse agents, again without affecting credit provision to the wider economy (implying it is desirable). I report other novel findings on effects of ownership, governance, remuneration and size. These results can guide bank reform...|$|R
