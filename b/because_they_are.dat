5|$|As such, such trusts are not {{enforceable}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> invalid. Equity {{has been}} willing to accept their validity in the common law to prevent the trustee committing fraud and keeping the property; justifications for this acceptance are debated.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{the fraud}} theory, secret trusts are {{sometimes}} classified as constructive trusts; {{the reason they}} do not have to follow the Wills Act 1837 is <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> created by the courts.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{strongly}} oxidative, many oxygen-xenon compounds are toxic; {{they are}} also explosive (highly exothermic), breaking down to elemental xenon and diatomic oxygen (O2) with much stronger chemical bonds than the xenon compounds.|$|E
60|$|From a {{very early}} age, indeed, this false note in Dolly had begun to make itself heard. While she was yet quite a child, Herminia noticed with a certain tender but {{shrinking}} regret that Dolly seemed to attach undue importance to the mere upholsteries and equipages of life,--to rank, wealth, title, servants, carriages, jewelry. At first, to be sure, Herminia hoped this might prove but the passing foolishness of childhood: as Dolly grew up, however, it became clearer each day that the defect was in the grain--that Dolly's whole mind was incurably and congenitally aristocratic or snobbish. She had that mean admiration for birth, position, adventitious advantages, which is {{the mark of the}} beast in the essentially aristocratic or snobbish nature. She admired people <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> rich, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> high-placed, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> courted, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> respected; not <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> good, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> wise, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> noble-natured, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> respect-worthy.|$|R
60|$|Then why did God {{take such}} trouble for them? Why did God care for them, and help them, and work wonders for them? Why? Exactly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> so bad. He that hath ears to hear let him hear, and {{understand}} by this example of all examples what manner of God our God <b>is.</b> Just <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> so bad, His goodness yearned over {{them all the}} more, and longed to make them good. Just <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> so unclean and brutish His holiness longed all the more to cleanse them. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> so stupid and ignorant, His wisdom longed to make them wise. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> so miserable, His pity yearned over them, as a father over a child fallen into danger. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> sick, <b>they</b> had all the more need of a physician. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> lost, there {{was all the more}} reason for seeking and saving them. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> utterly weak, God desired all the more to put His strength into them, that His strength might be made perfect in weakness.|$|R

5|$|Collected from coastal waters, zircon-bearing sand is {{purified}} by spiral concentrators {{to remove}} lighter materials, {{which are then}} returned to the water <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> natural components of beach sand. Using magnetic separation, the titanium ores ilmenite and rutile are removed.|$|E
5|$|Growing food on rooftops {{could be}} an option for fast growing communities. Popular plants grown for food include, chives, oregano and {{lavender}} these plants are suitable for green roofs <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> evolutionarily equipped for Mediterranean climate.|$|E
5|$|Mendocino County Zinfandel wines {{have been}} {{considered}} high quality, but they are less known <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not heavily marketed.|$|E

5|$|Nearly all {{octopuses}} are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, {{and other}} molluscs such as whelks and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, {{fish and other}} cephalopods. Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include bivalve molluscs such as the cockle Clinocardium nuttallii, clams and scallops, and crustaceans such as crabs and spider crabs. Prey that {{it is likely to}} reject include moon snails, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> too large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> too securely fixed to the rock.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{medications}} and mechanical devices {{are the first}} choice in treatment <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> less invasive, are often effective, and are well tolerated. Oral medications include sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil (Levitra).|$|E
5|$|Prior to this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Although the isotropic distribution of bursts suggested {{that they do not}} occur within the disk of the Milky Way, some astronomers supported the idea that they occur within the Milky Way's halo, concluding that the bursts are visibly faint <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and that they can be detected <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> extremely energetic. The distance measurement and the calculations of the burst's total energy release unequivocally supported the latter theory, effectively ending the debate.|$|E
50|$|Persecution {{by humans}} is now rare. In the past, kestrels <b>were</b> killed <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> thought to take {{chickens}} and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{considered to be}} an omen of death.|$|R
25|$|In September 2005, Powell {{criticized the}} {{response}} to Hurricane Katrina. Powell said that {{thousands of people were}} not properly protected, but <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> poor rather than <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> black.|$|R
60|$|Everything {{was to be}} {{done very}} systematically. She would have Leghorns, Brahmas, and common fowls. The first, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> laid so many eggs; the second, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> such fine, big fowls, and the third, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> such good mothers.|$|R
5|$|RNA interference-based {{applications}} {{are being developed}} to target persistent HIV-1 infection. Viruses like HIV-1 are particularly difficult targets for RNAi-attack <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> escape-prone, which requires combinatorial RNAi strategies to prevent viral escape.|$|E
5|$|Screening for aneurysms is not {{performed}} on a population level; <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> relatively rare, {{it would not}} be cost-effective. If someone has two or more first-degree relatives who have had an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, screening may be worthwhile.|$|E
5|$|This is {{a natural}} hot spring that spouts water {{constantly}} without stopping for recharge. Some of these are incorrectly called geysers, but <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not periodic in nature they are not considered true geysers.|$|E
50|$|Many {{children}} were admitted to orphanages <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> abandoned by their parents, not <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> orphans, but often because {{their parents were}} unmarried. Children {{born out of wedlock}} suffered from poor care.|$|R

5|$|Viral populations do {{not grow}} through cell division, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> acellular. Instead, {{they use the}} {{machinery}} and metabolism of a host cell to produce multiple copies of themselves, and they assemble in the cell.|$|E
5|$|Vitamins are {{classified}} as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. In humans there are 13 vitamins: 4 fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) and 9 water-soluble (8 B vitamins and vitamin C). Water-soluble vitamins dissolve easily in water and, in general, are readily excreted from the body, {{to the degree that}} urinary output is a strong predictor of vitamin consumption. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not as readily stored, more consistent intake is important. Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed through the intestinal tract with the help of lipids (fats). <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> more likely to accumulate in the body, {{they are more likely to}} lead to hypervitaminosis than are water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamin regulation is of particular significance in cystic fibrosis.|$|E
5|$|Although {{competitions}} are {{no longer}} held outdoors, the most important competitions (Olympics, World Championships, World Cups) are still scheduled for the Northern Hemisphere summer season <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> combined with outdoor events. Many lesser international events, however, are held during the European indoor season between October and March, culminating in the European Championships each year. Most of these competitions are multi-day events held together with air rifle matches.|$|E
50|$|Automatic gas-checks {{were used}} with {{studless}} ammunition in both Woolwich and polygroove rifled guns. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> {{otherwise known as}} “Rotating Gas-Checks” or “EOC Gas-Checks”. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> called “automatic” <b>because</b> <b>they</b> could <b>be</b> loaded into the barrel separately from the projectile, and automatically became firmly attached to the projectile on firing. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> called rotating gas-checks <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> able to rotate the projectile, enabling the use of studless projectiles. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> called EOC gas-checks, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> developed by the Armstrong company which owned EOC.|$|R

60|$|In my sermon last Sunday I said plainly that cholera, fever, {{and many}} more {{diseases}} were man's own fault, and that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> God's judgments just <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> man's own fault, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> God's plainspoken opinion of the sin of filth and of habits of living unfit for civilised Christian men.|$|R
5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and {{only on a}} very small scale. Brachiopods seldom settle on {{artificial}} surfaces, probably <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> vulnerable to pollution.

5|$|Below are lists {{selected}} by notable committees {{prior to the}} season that represent what they anticipate {{to be the most}} likely candidates to be recognized {{at the end of the}} season for their specific awards.

5|$|Commutative algebra makes great use of {{rings of}} polynomials {{in one or}} several variables, {{introduced}} above. Their multiplication is both commutative and associative.

50|$|The 2005 Horizon League Men's Basketball Tournament {{took place}} {{at the end of the}} 2004-05 regular season. The better seed hosted each first round match.
