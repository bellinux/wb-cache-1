5|$|Six {{years after}} the {{creation}} of the Sheffield Rules the Football Association rules were created. These were influenced by the Sheffield game but ongoing disputes meant that the Sheffield rules continued to be used. During this time many of the elements of the rules were incorporated into the association game. Regular games were played between Sheffield and London using <b>both</b> <b>sets</b> of rules. This led to an agreement on a single set of laws administered by the Football Association in 1877.|$|E

5|$|Although {{built and}} {{initially}} operated as two separate stations {{by the two}} companies, the C and the CCE platforms were sufficiently close together that a deep level interchange was constructed between the passages of the two stations with a small ticket office for passengers changing between the lines. Another passage led to lifts that surfaced within the main line station itself. With the entrance within the main line station able to serve <b>both</b> <b>sets</b> of platforms satisfactorily, the separate station buildings were considered unnecessary, and they both closed on 30 September 1914. The CCE building remains (converted for use as an electrical substation), but the C's building was demolished in 1934 to enable the construction of Euston House for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2008, {{a bridge}} {{replacement}} and expansion project got underway on Illinois 22 at the interchange with Interstate 94. This {{was necessary for}} the tollway which travels underneath to be widened to eight lanes. The old bridge, which was five lanes wide, was rebuilt with one that is eight lanes and includes full length dual left turn lanes in both directions. Other benefits are the improved entrances and exits {{to and from the}} interstate, modernized traffic signals, and the use of concrete pavement. The bulk of the work was completed by December 2009, however <b>both</b> <b>sets</b> of dual left turn lanes were not in operation until the following spring.|$|E

David Bellion gave Manchester United the lead in just 19 seconds {{but it was not}} until the start of the second half that tempers began to flare. A fracas between Robin van Persie and Kieran Richardson, following a late tackle on Richardson by Van Persie, resulted in clashes from <b>both</b> <b>sets</b> of players, which concluded with both protagonists getting booked by match official Mark Halsey.
