By the turn of the 20th century, Russell's name had become associated with this breed of dog.|$|E

5|$|Artificial selection, the {{deliberate}} selective <b>breeding</b> <b>of</b> domestic animals, {{is being used}} to breed back recently extinct animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that resembles that extinct wildtype ancestor. A breeding-back (intraspecific) hybrid may be very similar to the extinct wildtype in appearance, ecological niche and to some extent genetics, but the initial gene pool of that wild type is lost forever with its extinction. As a result, bred-back breeds are at best vague look-alikes of extinct wildtypes, as Heck cattle are of the aurochs.|$|E
5|$|Both {{farmers and}} {{scientists}} must continually {{draw on the}} irreplaceable resource of genetic diversity to ensure productive harvests. While genetic variability provides farmers with plants that have a higher resilience to pests and diseases and allows scientists access to a more diverse genome than {{can be found in}} highly selected crops. The <b>breeding</b> <b>of</b> monocultural crops steadily reduces genetic diversity as desirable traits are selected, and undesirable traits are removed. Farmers can increase within-crop diversity to some extent by planting mixtures of crop varieties; they can further increase in-field diversity by polycultural practices such as intercropping and companion planting.|$|E
5|$|<b>Breeding</b> <b>of</b> {{animals and}} plants showed related {{varieties}} varying in similar ways, or tending to revert to an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating common descent. He recounted how Lord Morton's mare apparently demonstrated telegony, offspring inheriting characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent, and accepted this process as increasing the variation available for natural selection.|$|E

5|$|French <b>breeding</b> <b>of</b> the Mérens {{is divided}} between two schools of thought. The first is {{traditional}} breeders seeking {{to preserve the}} original type, that of a light draft horse living high in the mountains year-round and retaining the hardiness for which the breed is known. The second comes from {{the conversion of the}} Mérens to a leisure horse in the 1980s, and aims to transform the physical type of the breed into a more sports-oriented horse to ensure the survival of the breed. This dichotomy has become a source of tension between farmers and users of the breed.|$|E
5|$|In Western societies, the {{domestic}} guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature; friendly, even affectionate responsiveness to handling and feeding; {{and the relative}} ease of caring for them, continue to make guinea pigs a popular pet. Organizations devoted to competitive <b>breeding</b> <b>of</b> guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many specialized breeds of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders.|$|E

40|$|Numbers <b>of</b> <b>{{breeding}}</b> pairs <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> {{birds and}} breeding density are established by territory mapping in Limanski (12. 9 ha), Futoški (8. 26 ha), and Dunavski (3. 9 ha) Parks in Novi Sad from early March to late June 2007. In Limanski Park 11 species of breeders were found, the most numerous being tree sparrow (Passer montanus). Futoški Park had 15 breeders {{and the most}} numerous were great tit (Parus major). The smallest number of species (9) bred in Dunavski Park, with great tit as the most common breeder. The greatest density <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> pairs was recorded in the largest park (37. 7 pairs/km 2). Hole-breeders dominated in Futoški and Dunavski Park, but their number {{was the same as}} the number of canopy-breeders in Limanski Park. Measured with Sorensen index of similarity, the greatest similarity was found between <b>breeding</b> avifauna <b>of</b> Futoški and Dunavski Park (72), then between Futoški and Limanski (61), while the smallest similarity was found if we compare <b>breeding</b> avifauna <b>of</b> Dunavski and Limanski Park.

5|$|Of {{the five}} species kept {{commonly}} as pets, only Campbell's dwarf hamster and Djungarian hamsters {{are able to}} interbreed and produce live hybrid offspring. Although hybrids make suitable pets, the <b>breeding</b> <b>of</b> hybrids and cloning can cause health and reproduction problems. In addition, the widespread breeding and distribution of hybrids could threaten the existence of both pure species and subspecies of the ecosystem, resulting in only mongrels. Hybridizing causes each litter to become smaller and the young begin to form congenital problems.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe 18 penguin {{species are}} {{exclusively}} and widely {{distributed in the}} Southern hemisphere, from the Equator to the Antarctic continent, and are thus submitted to various ecological constraints in their reproductive strategy.

Here we describe and compare the <b>breeding</b> cycle <b>of</b> all the penguin species highlighting the characteristics of each species in terms <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> range, population status, threats induce by environmental changes, duration of the different phases <b>of</b> the <b>breeding</b> cycle, mate fidelity, body mass, body height, egg mass and duration of egg formation.

5|$|The Morgan {{trotting}} stallion Shepherd F. Knapp was {{exported to}} England in the 1860s, where his trotting ability influenced the <b>breeding</b> <b>of</b> Hackney horses. During this period, numerous Morgan mares {{may have been}} brought west and integrated into Texan horse herds, which influenced {{the development of the}} American Quarter Horse breed. The Morgan horse also was an ancestor of the Missouri Fox Trotter. By the 1870s, however, longer-legged horses came into fashion, and Morgan horses were crossed with those of other breeds. This resulted in the virtual disappearance of the original style Morgan, although a few remained in isolated areas.|$|E
5|$|The Murray River and {{southern}} tributaries originally displayed {{a pattern of}} high flows in winter, high flows and floods in spring, and low flows in summer and autumn. The <b>breeding</b> <b>of</b> Murray cod and other Murray-Darling native fish was adapted to these natural flow patterns. River regulation for irrigation has reversed these natural flow patterns, with negative effects on the breeding and recruitment of Murray cod. The Murray and most southern tributaries now experience high irrigation flows in summer and autumn and low flows in winter and spring. Small and medium floods including the once annual spring flood-pulse have been completely eliminated.|$|E
