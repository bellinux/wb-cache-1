5|$|The {{game has}} been {{compared}} by the developer as akin to skateboarding games, but where the player controls a goat aimed at doing as much damage as possible around an open world map, without any other larger goals. The game, initially developed as a joke prototype from an internal game jam and shown in an early alpha state in YouTube videos, was met with excitement and attention, prompting the studio to <b>build</b> <b>out</b> the game into a releasable state while still retaining various non-breaking bugs and glitches to maintain the game's entertainment value.|$|E

The risk of cold storing perishable food, without an assured way to move and sell it, puts the economic viability of expensive cold storage in doubt. In the absence of organised retail competition and with a ban on foreign direct investment in multi-brand retailers, foreign direct investments are unlikely to begin in cold storage and farm logistics infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|Overwatch {{came about}} in the {{aftermath}} of Blizzard's decision to cancel the massively multiplayer online role-playing game Titan in 2013, a project that had been in development for about seven years. While most others assigned to the project were transferred to other departments within Blizzard, a small team of about 40 people, led by director Jeff Kaplan, were tasked {{to come up with a}} new concept for a game in a few months. After some brainstorming, they came onto the idea of a hero team-based shooter, building upon the success of games like Team Fortress 2 and multiplayer online battle arenas. They started with assets developed for Titan to demonstrate the proof-of-concept, and were greenlit to <b>build</b> <b>out</b> the full game, the first new intellectual property that Blizzard had developed since StarCraft.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} the Switch came about as Nintendo's {{reaction}} to several quarters of financial losses into 2014, attributed to poor sales of its previous console, the Wii U, and market competition from mobile gaming. Nintendo's then-president Satoru Iwata pushed the company towards mobile gaming and novel hardware. The Switch's design is aimed at a wide demographic of video game players through the multiple modes of use. Nintendo opted to use more standard electronic components, such as a chipset based on Nvidia's Tegra line, to make development for the console easier for programmers and more compatible with existing game engines. As the Wii U had struggled to gain external support, leaving it with a weak software library, Nintendo preemptively sought the support of many third-party developers and publishers to help <b>build</b> <b>out</b> the Switch's game library alongside Nintendo's own first-party titles, including many independent video game studios. Prior to launch, Nintendo had announced that over 100 titles were in development by 70 developers.|$|E

The MOU also formed the Brooklyn Bridge Park Development Corporation (BBPDC) to develop the park, following the guidelines as established by the Illustrative Master Plan. To begin the first-phase of construction, New York State, New York City, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey contributed {{a portion of the}} $360 million of capital funding for a complete park <b>build</b> <b>out.</b> To ensure the park is fiscally sustainable throughout the years, the MOU mandates that all maintenance and operations of the park are required to be economically self-sufficient, financed through revenues from commercial and residential development within the site.|$|E

25|$|The {{intent to}} allow all {{developers}} to have artistic freedom {{with the game}} created some internal strife in the team, particularly in the level design; they had initially scoped that level designers would create the basic parts of a level - main paths, scripted events, and the level's general design, while the artists would <b>build</b> <b>out</b> the world from that. As development progressed, they determined that the artists should be the ones constructing the level geometry, which the level designers resented. Subsequently, levels that were generated were not to the expected standards due to conflicts in the toolsets they used and Schafer's inability to oversee the process while handling the other duties of the studio. In 2003, {{the decision was made}} to dismiss all but one of the level design team, and unify the level design and art into a World Building team overseen by Erik Robson, the remaining level designer and who would go on to become the game's lead designer; the change, which Esmurdoc stated was for the better, disrupted the other departments at Double Fine.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, many American {{military}} personnel, {{who fell}} in love with the city while leaving for or returning from the Pacific, settled in the city, prompting the creation of the Sunset District, Visitacion Valley, and the total <b>build</b> <b>out</b> of San Francisco. During this period, Caltrans commenced an aggressive freeway construction program in the Bay Area. However, Caltrans soon encountered strong resistance in San Francisco, for the city's high population density meant that virtually any right-of-way would displace a large number of people. Caltrans tried to minimize displacement (and its land acquisition costs) by building double-decker freeways, but the crude state of civil engineering at that time resulted in construction of some embarrassingly ugly freeways which ultimately turned out to be seismically unsafe. In 1959, the Board of Supervisors voted to halt construction of any more freeways in the city, an event known as the Freeway Revolt. Although some minor modifications have been allowed to the ends of existing freeways, the city's anti-freeway policy has remained in place ever since.|$|E

The CBS studio includes a [...] outside video display, {{which has been}} a controversial addition to the Loop community. Morningstar has moved its global headquarters into the building. The 15th floor was original built out by a luxury shared office space company called Sterling. It was to include the following. 100 individual workspaces for rent,a spa, pool hall, recording studio, graphic design shop, audio-visual board room, and concierge. While they did <b>build</b> <b>out</b> the space, most of the amenities never were realized, as the owners of Sterling had committed fraud by faking their construction bond on a ink jet printer. This was found after they did not pay most of the bills for the <b>build</b> <b>out</b> and an attempt was made to cash in the bond to pay said bills. The owner/manager took over after this occurred. They eventually found a company called Regus that took over the space and has been renting it out as shared office space ever since.|$|E

500|$|A {{series of}} {{upgrades}} {{were made to}} the hill ahead of the 1952 Winter Olympics. A start platform was constructed {{at the top of the}} hill to ensure better start conditions. A double pull-hook ski lift was built on the north side of the hill. Floodlights were installed along the course to allow training and work during the evening. Ten loudspeakers and three microphones were installed as a transportable system. The hump at the top of the hill was leveled somewhat and the earthwork used to <b>build</b> <b>out</b> the bottom of the hill. The road from Lillevann Station on the Holmenkollen Line was upgraded and a tunnel laid under the course to allow spectators to gather on both sides. A 200-seat press stand, including work stations and telephone booths, was constructed on the south side of the bottom of the hill. Opposite a stand for official guests was built, with a capacity for 300 people. Boxes at the finish line were built for officials and time-keepers. The upgrades to the venue cost 336,000 Norwegian krone (NOK). During the Olympics the hill was [...] long and had a drop of , starting at [...] above mean sea level.|$|E
