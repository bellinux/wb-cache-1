40|$|The {{mountain}} pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), is a destructive forest pest endemic to western North America. It breeds in the phloem of Pinus species, and during epidemic population levels, healthy trees are killed. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine how the quality of brood trees affects the fitness of {{mountain pine}} beetle offspring. The lipid content of offspring was measured relative to <b>brood</b> <b>tree</b> quality. Maternal effects were tested by rearing beetles of different sizes in hosts of constant quality and measuring brood characteristics. The population characteristics of beetles responding to aggregation pheromones were compared to that of beetles emerging from infested trees. The largest offspring were found to emerge first, but did not have the highest lipid contents. Large and small beetles were found to have similar absolute fat contents. Females were not affected by their mother's condition, but males were marginally affected. The original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Spruce {{bark beetle}} {{outbreaks}} {{are common in}} Norway spruce forests following windstorm damage, due to ample availability of brood material. The realization of an outbreak depends on factors regulating the Ips typographus population dynamics, such as weather conditions and salvage cutting. In this study, we take an ecosystem modelling approach to analyse the influence of multiple environmental factors on the risk for I. typographus outbreaks. Model calculations of I. typographus phenology and population dynamics {{as a function of}} weather and <b>brood</b> <b>tree</b> availability were developed and implemented in the LPJ-GUESS ecosystem modelling framework. The model simulations were driven by gridded climate data covering Sweden with a spatial resolution of 0. 5 ° and a daily temporal resolution. Records on storm damage and I. typographus outbreak periods in Sweden for the period of 1960 – 2009 were used for model evaluation, and a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the model behaviour. The model simulations replicated the observed pattern in outbreak frequency, being more common in southern and central Sweden than in northern Sweden. A warmer climate allowing for more than one generation per year can increase the risk for attacks on living trees. The effect of countermeasures, aiming at either reduce the availability of brood material or the I. typographus population size, is dependent on a non-linear relation between I. typographus attack density and reproductive success. The sensitivity analysis indicated a major reduction in the risk of attacks on living trees by timely salvage cutting and cutting of infested trees. Knowledge uncertainties associated with attacks on standing trees, i. e. factors influencing tree defence capacity and I. typographus reproductive success, should be further addressed...|$|E

40|$|Mass-propagation of the spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus, {{following}} windfalls {{and drought}} {{is a serious}} threat to mature spruce forests. Climate change will affect the population dynamics of I. typographus directly as the swarming activity and development rate are mainly controlled by temperature, and indirectly via changes in availability of <b>brood</b> <b>trees.</b> Today, I. typographus is in general univoltine in southern Sweden. In Denmark, however, the weather conditions usually support the production of a second generation. By modelling the temperature dependent population dynamics, we have evaluated the effect of regional climate change scenarios for the period of 2070 - 2099 on I. typographus in southern Sweden. Our results indicate that temperature increase will have a step-wise effect on the population dynamics. Earlier spring swarming and a faster development from egg to mature bark beetle increase the probability of a second swarming period during summer. A second swarming will be customary with an annual mean temperature increase of 2 - 3 degrees C. The thermal requirement for development of a second generation may, however, not be fulfilled every year with an annual mean temperature increase less than 5 - 6 degrees C. Winter is fatal for immature bark beetles, and the larger the temperature increase, the higher the probability that the second generation will complete development and survive hibernation. The temperature regime during autumn will therefore have a decisive impact {{on the size of the}} swarming population next spring. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{ecology of}} the eastern larch beetle, Dendroctonus simplex LeConte, was studied in Newfoundland. Overwintered beetles emerged in May. One {{generation}} and two broods were produced in both 1983 and 1984. Females initiated attacks and males arrived up to two days later. One to four pairs of beetles used each entrance hole but each pair constructed a different gallery. [...] Egg galleries were vertical, slightly sinuous and averaged 41 cm in length. Females laid zero to four eggs per niche averaging 1. 4. The average number of eggs per gallery and per cm of gallery was 39 and 1. 0, respectively. Mean brood density was 49 individuals per 100 cm². [...] About 90 % of all parents reemerged and {{a small proportion of}} them attacked a second group of trees and produced a second brood. Galleries in second <b>brood</b> <b>trees</b> averaged 26 cm in length and 27 eggs per gallery. Mean brood density averaged 23 individuals per 100 cm². Following brood production 61 % of parents reemerged and likely died. [...] Development from egg to adult averaged 60 to 70 days for first and second broods, respectively. [...] During egg gallery construction and oviposition D. simplex flight muscles degenerated. Flight muscles were completely regenerated in only 17 % of 96 reemerged beetles in 1984. No reemerged beetles were observed to fly. [...] Emergence, host attack and reemergence occurred between 10 : 30 and 17 : 00 hours and at temperatures of 4 ﾟC or higher. Peaks of attack, which reflects flight peaks, occurred at temperatures of 10 ﾟC or higher. [...] Only adults overwintered. Freezing temperatures caused high mortality among immature stages of the second brood. [...] Thirty-four percent of new brood adults emerged in the fall and reentered galleries at the base of trees for hibernation. [...] The fourth larval instar had the highest mortality, at 29. 2 %, and pupae the lowest, at 7. 6 %. Total mortality was 79 % and 82 % for first and second broods, respectively. Pathogens caused the largest proportion of mortality among eggs, second instar larvae and pupae, resinosis among first instar larvae and parasitoids among third and fourth instar larvae. Overwintering mortality was 7. 8 %. [...] Fifty-two species of insects, spiders, mites and nematodes were associated with D. simplex in 1983...|$|R

A low quality diet has been shown to have long-term developmental costs and usually results in elevated corticosterone levels, which may mediate these costs.

40|$|We {{examined}} whether {{strategies of}} reproductive allocation may reduce long-term immunocompetence through {{the effects of}} manipulated effort on secondary or acquired immunity. We tested whether increased reproductive effort leads to reduced immune function and survival by manipulating <b>brood</b> size in <b>tree</b> swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and exposing breeding females to a primary and secondary exposure of sheep red blood cells to elicit a humoral immune response. Females raising enlarged broods produced fewer secondary antibodies than did females raising control or reduced broods. Most importantly, individuals with high secondary responses {{were more likely to}} survive to breed 3 years after brood manipulations, suggesting that differences in disease susceptibility may be caused by trade-offs in reproductive allocation. We also found that individual quality, measured by clutch initiation date, mediated the effects of brood manipulations, with higher-quality birds showing a greater ability to deal with increases in effort...|$|R
2500|$|Aggressively searching out, removing, and {{destroying}} the <b>brood</b> in infested <b>trees</b> {{is the best}} way to slow the spread of mountain pine beetles; however, it may not protect specific trees. Spraying trees to prevent attack is the most effective way to protect a small number of high-value trees from mountain pine beetles. Carbaryl, permethrin and bifenthrin are registered in the United States for use in the prevention of pine beetle infestations. Carbaryl is considered by the EPA to likely be carcinogenic to humans. [...] It is moderately toxic to wild birds and partially to highly toxic to aquatic organisms. Permethrin is easily metabolized in mammalian livers, so is less dangerous to humans. Birds are also practically not affected by permethrin. [...] Negative effects can be seen in aquatic ecosystems, as well as it being very toxic to beneficial insects. Bifenthrin is moderately dangerous to mammals, including humans; it is slightly more toxic to birds and aquatic ecosystems than permethrin, as well as extremely toxic to beneficial insects.|$|R
40|$|This study {{dealt with}} the species {{distribution}} and frequency of ophiostomatoid fungi associated with the bark beetle Ips typographus on Norway spruce and Scots pine in north-eastern Poland. At all locations high spruce bark beetle damage has occurred in 2002 - 2003. Fungi were isolated from beetles and from <b>brood</b> systems of <b>trees</b> infested by the spruce bark beetle. The ophiostomatoid fungi were represented by 13 species. A similar spectrum of ophiostomatoid fungi as that recorded from Picea abies was associated with I. typographus on Pinus sylvestris trees. The most frequent ophiostomatoid species isolated from beetles, phloem and sapwood of Norway spruce were O. bicolor and O. penicillatum. The frequency of occurrence of ophiostomatoid fungi varied significantly among the examined locations. O. bicolor was the most frequently found species on Scots pine infested by I. typographus. The potential role of ophiostomatoid fungi in the epidemiology of I. typographus is discussed.

40|$|Few {{field studies}} have {{examined}} experimentally the importance of food availability on adult activity and breeding performance in birds. I studied two populations of insectivorous Tree Swallows Tachycineta bicolor, 3 km apart, that differed primarily {{in the amount of}} food available to the breeding birds. I obtained an index of food abundance and conducted experiments involving the transfer of clutches and <b>broods</b> between populations. <b>Tree</b> Swallows showed substantial phenotypic plasticity in breeding characteristics and parental activities. My results demonstrated that food abundance during the the breeding season influenced clutch size, egg quality, nestling growth, behavior, survival to fledging and adult activities such as frequency of feeding young. It was important where Tree Swallows reproduced, where their nestlings were raised and probably, by whom they were raised. Food abundance, year of breeding and sequence in the clutch explained significant amounts of variation in egg weights. Growth of nestlings was not influenced by type of parent (i. e. natural or foster) or by pre-hatch factors such as location of incubation. However, the location where nestlings were raised explained much of the variation in growth of nestlings, and regardless of where parents nested, genetic variation in offspring and variation in provisioning abilities of parents may have been important components of within area variation in growth. These results support the hypothesis of food limitation of clutch size that also predicted slower nestling growth and poorer fledging success of young raised where food was less abundant...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of BiologyDavid A. HaukosThe lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) is {{a species}} of prairie grouse native to the {{southwest}} Great Plains. Population declines and threats to populations of lesser prairie-chickens led U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list the species as “threatened” {{under the protection of}} the Endangered Species Act in May 2014. Lesser prairie-chickens are found within three distinct ecoregions of Kansas and Colorado and portions of the species’ range are affected by tree encroachment into grasslands. The effect of trees on lesser prairie-chickens is poorly understood. I evaluated habitat selection and reproductive success and across the northern portion of the species’ range. I captured female lesser prairie-chickens within the three different ecoregions in Kansas and Colorado to track nest and brood survival and measure nest and brood habitat. My findings show that there are regional and annual variations in nest and brood survival. Mean nest survival during 2013 and 2014 was estimated to be 0. 388 (95 % CI = 0. 343 – 0. 433) for a 35 -day exposure period. Brood survival during 2013 and 2014 was estimated to be 0. 316 (95 % CI = 0. 184 – 0. 457) for 56 days. Chick survival was the lowest {{during the first week of}} life and is probably a limiting factor for population growth. Chick and brood survival decreased as Julian hatch date increased. Across the northern portion of the species’ range, females consistently select visual obstruction between 2 - 3 dm. Vegetation at the nest changes between regions and years to reflect environmental and regional conditions. Broods consistently selected habitats with greater percent cover of forbs than was expected at random across all study sites. Broods also selected against areas of bare ground. The threshold of lesser prairie-chicken use was 2 trees/ha throughout the year. No nests were located within areas with greater densities. Lesser prairie-chickens had a greater probability of use at greater distances from trees and at lower tree densities. To provide adequate nesting habitat managers should provide 2 - 3 dm of visual obstruction. Providing forb cover with visual obstruction between 2. 5 - 5 dm near nesting habitat should provide adequate habitat for <b>broods.</b> Removing <b>trees</b> in core habitats and expand removal efforts outward should expand potential habitat for lesser prairie-chickens...|$|R
40|$|We {{manipulated}} <b>brood</b> {{sizes of}} <b>Tree</b> Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) in 1996 and 1997 {{to test for}} the existence of intra- and intergenerational costs of reproduction. Modal clutch size was six eggs, but experimental brood sizes ranged from two to nine young. Nestling starvation was higher in 1996 (and dependent on brood size) than in 1997, but in both years enlargement of brood size resulted in increased productivity. Nestling mass near fledging was negatively correlated with brood size, but tarsus length and wing chord were not. Food deliveries by parents increased steadily between broods of two to six young but then remained constant between broods of six to nine young. The loss of female mass between incubation {{and the end of the}} nestling period was positively related to the pair 2 ̆ 7 s total feeding effort, and female mass near fledging declined with increasing brood size. The latter decline disappeared, however, when broods of nine were omitted. Adult return rate (1996 to 1997) was highest among birds that raised enlarged broods. Our results, and a review of other studies of Tree Swallows, suggest that broods of seven or eight young can be raised without costs to the parents or young, and it appears that costs associated with feeding young have not influenced annual fecundity of Tree Swallows. Rather, egg production is most likely limited by energy availability to laying females. A major cost of reproduction for Tree Swallows probably arises from nest-site competition in that early arrival in spring to obtain nest sites exposes adults to high risks of death from starvation...|$|R
