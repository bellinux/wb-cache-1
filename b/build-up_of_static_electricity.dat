50|$|The amount <b>of</b> <b>static</b> <b>electricity</b> we feel varies {{according}} to factors such as our body and foot size. A larger body and bigger feet require more charge to be stored to produce the same voltage.

There is more <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>static</b> charge when the air is dry. Most people feel harmless shocks at around 2,000-4,000 volts. However electrical components can be damaged by {{as little as a}} few volts. It is estimated that between eight percent and 33 percent of product losses—-the proportion of products which are rendered faulty—-are due to <b>static</b> <b>electricity.</b> <b>Static</b> <b>electricity</b> is generally harmless to the individual but if not controlled, electrostatic discharge can cause product damage to electrostatic sensitive devices and lead to machinery downtime, lost man-hours, returned products and warranty costs particularly in the semiconductor and electronics industries, which caused 5 billion USD worth of damage to products each year.|$|R

40|$|Caltex Australia and the {{petroleum}} industry {{have experienced a}} number of incidents on retail sites, resulting in the ignition of fuel vapour during the delivery process. <b>Static</b> <b>electricity</b> is a known risk in the industry and these incidents are potentially related to the generation <b>of</b> <b>static</b> <b>electricity</b> in the delivery process.

50|$|Transparent {{conductive}} coatings {{are used}} in applications where {{it is important that}} the coating conduct electricity or dissipate static charge. Conductive coatings are used to protect the aperture from electromagnetic Interference, while dissipative coatings are used to prevent the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>static</b> <b>electricity.</b> Transparent conductive coatings are also used extensively to provide electrodes in situations where light is required to pass, for example in flat panel display technologies and in many photoelectrochemical experiments. A common substance used in transparent conductive coatings is indium tin oxide (ITO). ITO is not very optically transparent, however. The layers must be thin to provide substantial transparency, particularly at the blue end of the spectrum. Using ITO, sheet resistances of 20 to 10,000 ohms per square can be achieved. An ITO coating may be combined with an antireflective coating to further improve transmittance. Other TCOs (Transparent Conductive Oxides) include AZO (Aluminium doped Zinc Oxide), which offers much better UV transmission than ITO.A special class of transparent conductive coatings applies to infrared films for theater-air military optics where IR transparent windows need to have (Radar) stealth (Stealth technology) properties. These are known as RAITs (Radar Attenuating / Infrared Transmitting) and include materials such as boron doped DLC (Diamond-like carbon).|$|E
5000|$|The {{most stable}} of {{plastics}} used in photo preservation, polyester, does not generate any harmful chemical elements, but {{nor does it}} have any capability to absorb acids generated by the photograph itself. Polyester sleeves and encapsulation have been praised {{for their ability to}} protect the photograph from humidity and environmental pollution, slowing the reaction between the item and the atmosphere. This is true, however the polyester just as frequently traps these elements next to the material it is intended to protect. This is especially risky in a storage environment that experiences drastic fluctuations in humidity or temperature, leading to ferrotyping, or sticking of the photograph to the plastic. [...] Photographs sleeved or encapsulated in polyester cannot be stored vertically in boxes because they will slide down next to each other within the box, bending and folding, nor can the archivist write directly onto the polyester to identify the photograph. Therefore, it is necessary to either stack polyester protected photographs horizontally within a box, or bind them in a three ring binder. Stacking the photos horizontally within a flat box will greatly reduce ease of access, and binders leave three sides of the photo exposed to the effects of light and do not support the photograph evenly on both sides, leading to slumping and bending within the binder. The plastic used for enclosures has been manufactured to be as frictionless as possible to prevent scratching photos during insertion to the sleeves. Unfortunately, the slippery nature of the enclosure generates a <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>static</b> <b>electricity,</b> which attracts dust and lint particles. The static can attract the dust {{to the inside of the}} sleeve, as well, where it can scratch the photograph. [...] Likewise, these components that aid in insertion of the photo, referred to as slip agents, can break down and transfer from the plastic to the photograph, where they deposit as an oily film, attracting further lint and dust. At this time, there is no test to evaluate the long-term effects of these components on photographs. In addition, the plastic sleeves can develop kinks or creases in the surface, which will scratch away at the emulsion during handling.|$|E

40|$|Issue: Rubber {{is a good}} heat {{insulator}} and contains {{a significant amount of}} volatile organic material. Under proper conditions (heat and oxygen), it may burn. Best Practice: This best practice describes various steps and precautions for minimizing/eliminating recycled rubber combustion and flammability. All automotive rubber products such as hose, mats, and belts must meet FMVSS 302 standards. Other specifications that rubbery material must meet are UL 94, ASTM D 470, C 542 and C 864. The release of volatiles upon burning rubber is of concern. ASTM D 4205 - 93 describes test methods for determining flammability and combustion properties of rubbery materials. A copy is attached. Implementation: Process and store materials at ambient temperatures. Avoid <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>static</b> <b>electricity</b> which may cause combustion. All processing and storage areas should be strictly “non-smoking. ” Recycled rubber handlers need to have information on volatility of the material from MSDSs. A copy of a MSDS, as an example, is attached in the Material Storage Best Practice. It is best to avoid static build-up during shredding, grinding, and sorting steps. This is achieved by properly grounding processing equipment. Appendix I lists comparative Btu valves of TCF (tire-chip fuel) and TDF (tire-derived fuel) to give an idea regarding the extent of heat generated during the burning of these materials. Benefits: The major benefit is the reduction of fires in manufacturing, the storage of recycled rubber, and in the use of recycled rubber. Also, special care should be taken to remove hot wire during processing to help eliminate any fire...|$|E

40|$|Static {{charge is}} {{something}} that most individuals recognize as something that happens when they walk across a carpet, touch their refrigerator and get shocked. Most people seldom recognize that a shock due to static charge, or properly called, Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) is a phenomenon that has significantly damaging effects. Most people who stay informed of the current news, have heard stories <b>of</b> <b>static</b> charge causing a pump {{at a gas station}} to start on fire. Some individuals may even recognize that when they change the memory on a computer, they need to ensure that they are properly electrically grounded to prevent damage to any of the sensitive electronic components within their computers. However, it is unlikely that very many individuals would ever consider that an ESD event may be significant enough to initiate an explosive material. Explosives materials are materials that many people might recognize as susceptible to initiation due to mechanical insults. Plastic and foam materials are often used to protect explosives. Unfortunately, often many of these materials are dielectric materials which are susceptible to triboelectric charge transfer, or <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>static</b> charge, and thus, become a potential hazardous electrical source that may cause the explosive to inadvertently initiate. To eliminate the generation <b>of</b> <b>static</b> <b>electricity,</b> {{it is important to understand}} the methods in which <b>static</b> <b>electricity</b> is generated on these types of materials. If the method of triboelectric charge transfer is understood, it is possible to minimize the effects to ensure that the device that is designed to prevent mechanical insults to the explosive materials does not become its greatest electrical insult. Once the method of charge transfer is understood, a potential method of charge removal might be possible to ensure that explosive devices are protected from both mechanical and electrical insults.
