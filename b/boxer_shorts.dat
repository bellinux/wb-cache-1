40|$|Charles <b>Boxer’s</b> <b>short</b> book Race Relations in the Portuguese Colonial Empire 1415 – 1825 was {{published}} {{half a century}} ago and has continued to be read to this day. In fact, it constitutes a singular piece of analytical debate in the work of a writer who saw himself chiefly as a descriptive historian, bibliophile and archivist and who studiously avoided political posturing. The 1963 essay, however, was conceived from the start in a polemical mode, Boxer was perfectly conscious of the impact it would have as he produced it. The present essay is an assessment of the work {{in the light of the}} recent debates about racial differentiation and its implications in diverse historical and cultural contexts. The essay argues for the need to triangulate the traditional comparison between Brazil and the United States with the South African experience...|$|R

50|$|Although {{the basic}} design for boardshorts remains largely the same, some {{manufacturers}} {{have taken advantage}} of new technology. Because surfers and other water-sports enthusiasts commonly wear boardshorts without underwear, one of the major complaints has been about the use of velcro for the fly closure which tends to entangle pubic hair. A solution that some manufactures have come up with is to use a neoprene fly, which does not allow the fly to completely open, but provides enough stretch so that the shorts can be easily pulled on and off. Pubic hair does not get caught on the neoprene fly. To remedy another common complaint, about boardshorts stitching in the inseam area which would rub directly against the wearer's skin, many manufacturers switched to a seamless design, or use welding or glue, rather than stitches. Although it is very common for boardshorts to be worn without underwear, some male wearers prefer to wear compression <b>shorts,</b> <b>boxers,</b> a jockstrap or briefs under them. Some female surfers wear a swimsuit or bikini bottom under boardshorts.|$|R
