Woodruff had <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> right patient for some time, {{hoping to find a}} patient with an identical twin to act as the donor, as this would significantly reduce the risk of rejection. The patient that Woodruff eventually found was a 49-year-old man suffering from severely impaired kidney function who received one of his identical twin brother's kidneys on 30 October 1960. [...] Both twins lived an additional six years before dying of an unrelated disease. Woodruff thought that he had to be vigilant with his first kidney transplant, as he regarded the British medical community's attitude to be conservative towards transplantation. From then until his retirement in 1976, {{he performed}} 127 kidney transplants. Also in 1960, Woodruff published The Transplantation of Tissues and Organs, a comprehensive survey of transplant biology and one of seven books he wrote. He was awarded the 1969 Lister Medal for his contributions to surgical science. The corresponding Lister Oration, given at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, was delivered on 8 April 1970, and was titled 'Biological aspects of individuality'.|$|E
500|$|In mid-1990, Nakayama hired Tom Kalinske {{to replace}} Katz as CEO of Sega of America. [...] Although Kalinske {{initially}} {{knew little about}} the video game market, he surrounded himself with industry-savvy advisors. A believer in the razor and blades business model, he developed a four-point plan: cut {{the price of the}} console, create a U.S.-based team to develop games targeted at the American market, continue and expand the aggressive advertising campaigns, and replace the bundled game Altered Beast with a new title, Sonic the Hedgehog. The Japanese board of directors initially disapproved of the plan, but all four points were approved by Nakayama, who told Kalinske, [...] "I hired you to make the decisions for Europe and the Americas, so go ahead and do it."

[...] Nintendo's console debuted against an established competitor, while NEC's TurboGrafx-16 failed to gain traction, and NEC soon pulled out of the market. [...] In large part due to the popularity of Sonic the Hedgehog, the Sega Genesis outsold the SNES in the United States nearly two to one during the 1991 holiday season. This success led to Sega having control of 65% of the 16-bit console market in January 1992, making it the first time Nintendo was not the console leader since December 1985.|$|E
2500|$|This {{leads to}} the central theme of the short story, as (returning to 1928) the convict and the {{household}} servant, a devout Muslim, attempt to forecast {{the outcome of the}} King's chest condition. They note that the King had forenamed in 1922 the disease that would strike him in 1928; from this, the convict concludes that the King's kindly actions towards the general had saved the general's life and led to a [...] "blood-debt" [...] that would be repaid by the King recovering from his illness. In the short story, this episode with the general and his overcoat is stated to have taken place {{towards the end of the}} pilgrimage at an Indian cemetery, though accounts of Kipling's movements during the pilgrimage ascribe the incident that inspired the short story to a few days earlier on 11 May, a [...] "bitterly cold" [...] day when Kipling had <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> King and Haig near Ypres.|$|E

2500|$|... "The End" [...] {{provoked}} {{an immediate}} response, {{and received a}} strongly polarized reaction from both fans and TV critics alike. Response to the episode was positive and negative in equal measures, both in the United States and internationally. According {{to the web site}} Metacritic, [...] "The End" [...] received [...] "generally favorable reviews" [...] with a Metascore – a weighted average based on the impressions of 31 critical reviews – of 74 out of 100. Of the most positive reviews, IGN writer Chris Carbot gave the episode a score of 10/10, describing it as [...] "one of the most enthralling, entertaining and satisfying conclusions [...] could have hoped for." [...] Eric Deggans of the St. Petersburg Times also gave [...] "The End" [...] a perfect score, calling it [...] "emotional, funny [...] expertly measured". Robert Bianco of USA Today rated the finale as perfect as well, stating that it could [...] "stand with the best any series has produced". James Poniewozik of Time also praised [...] "The End", calling it [...] "full of heart and commitment"; Zap2it's Ryan McGee described the episode as [...] "a masterpiece." [...] Jason Hughes of TV Squad felt that [...] "as finales go, 'The End' will definitely go down as one of the more satisfying ones". Todd VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times felt that the episode [...] "provides character payoffs we’ve <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for.</b> ... <b>The</b> important thing ... is not answers.

2500|$|... "The {{outbreak}} of war revivified the vague ideas of revolution {{which had been}} floating about {{in the mind of}} young Bengal for the last ten years and the hopes of those who had throughout <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> opportunity, and the possibility of a successful revolt seemed imminent," [...] wrote Nixon. [...] "It was probably some time in September 1914 that Jatin Mukherjee came to Calcutta in order to take such steps as England’s participation in a war with Germany seemed to call for in this direction.". Judging the time ripe for them to make full preparations for a revolution, Jatin’s men undertook taxi-cab robberies to provide funds for this purpose, as described in the Rowlatt Report. [...] Hence, on 26 August 1914, Shrish Chandra Mitra (Habu), one of his loyal associates, smuggled fifty Mauser pistols and forty-six thousand cartridges from the Rodda (arms dealers) in Kolkata, handed them over to Atul, before disappearing for good. Jatin Mukherjee distributed these dreadful arms to various units. Conceived by Jatin, as does a skilful stage manager, Atul chalked out a series of daring overt acts under the immediate leadership of Naren Bhattacharya alias M.N. Roy: these are all duly catalogued in the Rowlatt Report. Successive emissaries returned from Europe and America with the good news of the arrival of arms obtained from German authorities by the Berlin Committee. Balasore was chosen by Germany to land a shipment. Jatin with a handful of associates took shelter there. Then Atul dispatched Harikumar Chakravarti, Dr Jatin Ghoshal, Satish Chakravarti and a batch of workers with boats, rifles and other requisites to the other selected port at Raymangal in the Sundarbans. When information came that the Police had discovered Jatin's hideout in Balasore, Naren Ghose Chaudhury proposed spontaneously to rush to the spot for a showdown; Jadugopal Mukherjee objected: [...] "Dada is big enough to look after himself. Let us disperse." [...] Atul was stunned by this cynical order. After the failure of the Indo-German conspiracy and after Jatin’s untimely death, disheartened Atul and [...] other Jugantar leaders went underground in 1915, remaining so for about seven years. Even then, for several years, the revolutionaries entertained the hope of smuggling arms for an insurrection. In June 1916, Atul sent through Ananta Haldar a letter for Bhavabhushan Mitra at Deoghar, [...] "who was one of the trusted men of the party. Both Ananta and Bhava Bhushan were dealt with under the Defence Rules and interned in Bengal." [...] (Sealy, p24). [...] In the teeth of sporadic Police attempts to arrest them, once, in Chandernagore, while nursing [...] Charu Ghose, [...] Atul with the ailing co-worker on his shoulders, scaled the hospital wall. Dr Govindin, the Civil Surgeon, narrated this to Bhupendrakumar Datta. According to Nixon: [...] "Jatin Mukherjee had at this time gone to Balasore, and Atul Ghosh was a big figure in the arrangement for these outrages." [...] In July 1916, [...] "Atul Ghosh was still the prompting spirit of all these gangs, and in the Barisal party, too, he seems to have wielded some influence.".|$|E
