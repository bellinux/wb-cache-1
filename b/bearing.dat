5|$|According to the manufacturer, the Xerxes.20plus {{incorporates}} key design {{elements from}} the TMS3, including the tungsten carbide <b>bearing</b> ball, {{inner and outer}} aluminium platter, mat and decoupler blobs. The isolation between the plinth layers of the 20 has been improved for the Plus. The <b>bearing</b> is of a higher quality; the platter and sub-platter have been redesigned. A mat with distinctive cut-outs {{is placed on the}} platter assembly to support the disc. While the top board sits on decoupling blobs, the lower half has bright polished-metal feet. The <b>bearing</b> ball, Blobs and mat are available to existing owners for retrofitting their legacy Xerxes.10 and Xerxes.20 turntables.|$|E
5|$|As {{a son of}} the sovereign, William {{was granted}} {{the use of the}} royal arms (without the electoral inescutcheon in the Hanoverian quarter) in 1781, {{difference}}d by a label of three points argent, the centre point <b>bearing</b> a cross gules, the outer points each <b>bearing</b> an anchor azure. In 1801 his arms altered with the royal arms, however the marks of difference remained the same.|$|E
5|$|As of 1789, as a {{daughter}} of the sovereign, Sophia had use of {{the arms of the}} kingdom, differenced by a label of three points argent, the centre point <b>bearing</b> a heart gules, the outer points each <b>bearing</b> a rose gules.|$|E
50|$|In addition, the {{positions}} of the main <b>bearings</b> must be between individual cylinders (L4 with 5 main <b>bearings,</b> or L6 with 7 main <b>bearings</b> - only one rod journal between main <b>bearings),</b> or between adjacent pairs of cylinders (L4 with 3 main <b>bearings,</b> L6 or V6 with 4 main <b>bearings,</b> or V8 with 5 main <b>bearings</b> - two rod journals between main <b>bearings).</b>|$|R
50|$|Thrust <b>bearings</b> {{are used}} to support axial loads, such as {{vertical}} shafts. Common designs are Thrust ball <b>bearings,</b> spherical roller thrust <b>bearings,</b> tapered roller thrust <b>bearings</b> or cylindrical roller thrust <b>bearings.</b> Also non-rolling-element <b>bearings</b> such as hydrostatic or magnetic <b>bearings</b> see some use where particularly heavy loads or low friction is needed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bearings</b> {{used are}} either oil <b>bearings</b> or {{magnetic}} <b>bearings.</b>|$|R
5|$|Candidates for non-operative {{treatment}} {{are limited to}} skeletally immature teenagers with a relatively small, intact lesion {{and the absence of}} loose bodies. Non-operative management may include activity modification, protected weight <b>bearing</b> (partial or non-weight <b>bearing),</b> and immobilization. The goal of non-operative intervention is to promote healing in the subchondral bone and prevent potential chondral collapse, subsequent fracture, and crater formation.|$|E
5|$|Carrier {{frequencies}} above 5kHz {{are likely}} to cause <b>bearing</b> damage unless protective measures are taken.|$|E

5000|$|In motorcycles, these <b>bearings</b> {{are also}} {{referred}} to as headset, or steering head <b>bearings</b> or steering neck <b>bearings.</b> These are usually tapered roller <b>bearings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Today {{ball and}} roller <b>bearings</b> {{are used in}} many {{applications}} which include a rotating component. Examples include ultra high speed <b>bearings</b> in dental drills, aerospace <b>bearings</b> in the Mars Rover, gearbox and wheel <b>bearings</b> on automobiles, flexure <b>bearings</b> in optical alignment systems, bicycle wheel hubs, and air <b>bearings</b> used in Coordinate-measuring machines.|$|R
50|$|In many applications, rolling-element <b>bearings,</b> such as ball or roller <b>bearings,</b> have {{replaced}} Babbitt <b>bearings.</b> Though such <b>bearings</b> {{can offer a}} lower coefficient of friction than plain <b>bearings,</b> their key advantage {{is that they can}} operate reliably without a continuous pressurized supply of lubricant. Ball and roller <b>bearings</b> can also be used in configurations that are required to carry both radial and axial thrusts. However, rolling-element <b>bearings</b> lack the beneficial damping and shock-load capability provided by fluid-film <b>bearings,</b> such as the Babbitt.|$|R

5|$|In sailing, it {{has long}} been known that if the <b>bearing</b> from the target to the pursuer remains {{constant}}, known as constant <b>bearing,</b> decreasing range (CBDR), equivalent to taking a fixed reference point at infinite distance, the two vessels are on a collision course, both travelling in straight lines. In a simulation, this is readily observed as the lines between the two remain parallel at all times.|$|E

5000|$|NRB is India's largest {{needle and}} {{cylindrical}} roller <b>bearings</b> producer headquartered in Mumbai. NRB was incorporated in 1965 as an Indo-French venture with Nadella and pioneered {{the production of}} needle roller <b>bearings</b> in India. Its eight manufacturing facilities in India and Thailand produce needle roller <b>bearings,</b> cylindrical roller <b>bearings,</b> tapered roller <b>bearings,</b> special ball <b>bearings,</b> thrust <b>bearings</b> and other anti friction solutions such as planetary shafts and pins.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Rolling life {{properties}} of ceramic <b>bearings</b> in water were studied. In addition, we investigated {{the influence of}} ceramics, such as Si 3 N 4, ZrO 2 and SiC, on rolling life of <b>bearings</b> in water. All ceramic <b>bearings</b> possess from 15 to 70 times longer rolling life than all AISI 440 C steel <b>bearings.</b> All Si 3 N 4 and ZrO 2 ceramic <b>bearings</b> possess from 3. 5 to 5 times longer rolling life than hybrid <b>bearings.</b> Rolling life of all SiC ceramic <b>bearings</b> is approximately the same as hybrid <b>bearings.</b> Rolling life of ceramic <b>bearings</b> in water is mainly due to propagation of cracks, pitting and flaking...|$|R
5|$|The Parallax Correctors {{were needed}} because the turrets were located {{hundreds}} of feet from the director. There was one for each turret, and each had the turret/director distance manually set in. They automatically received Relative Target <b>Bearing</b> (<b>bearing</b> from own ship's bow), and Target Range. They corrected the <b>bearing</b> order for each turret so that all rounds fired in a salvo converged on the same point.|$|E

5|$|The civil badge is a plain gold oval, <b>bearing</b> three crowns on the obverse side, and a rose, a thistle and a shamrock, {{emanating from}} a sceptre {{on the reverse}} side; both emblems are {{surrounded}} by a ring <b>bearing</b> the motto of the Order.|$|E
50|$|Thrust <b>bearings</b> and journal <b>bearings</b> are a {{critical}} part of design. They are hydrodynamic oil <b>bearings</b> or oil-cooled rolling-element <b>bearings.</b> Foil <b>bearings</b> are used in some small machines such as micro turbines and also have strong potential for use in small gas turbines/auxiliary power units.|$|R
5000|$|They can be broadly {{classified}} into two types: fluid dynamic <b>bearings</b> (also known as hydrodynamic <b>bearings)</b> and hydrostatic <b>bearings.</b> Hydrostatic <b>bearings</b> are externally pressurized fluid <b>bearings,</b> where the fluid is usually oil, water or air, and the pressurization {{is done by}} a pump. Hydrodynamic <b>bearings</b> rely on the high speed of the [...] (the part of the shaft resting on the fluid) to pressurize the fluid in a wedge between the faces. Fluid <b>bearings</b> are frequently used in high load, high speed or high precision applications where ordinary ball <b>bearings</b> would have short life or cause high noise and vibration. They are also used increasingly to reduce cost. For example, hard disk drive motor fluid <b>bearings</b> are both quieter and cheaper than the ball <b>bearings</b> they replace.|$|R
5|$|Silicon nitride <b>bearings</b> {{are both}} full ceramic <b>bearings</b> and ceramic hybrid <b>bearings</b> with balls in {{ceramics}} and races in steel. Silicon nitride ceramics have good shock resistance {{compared to other}} ceramics. Therefore, ball <b>bearings</b> made of silicon nitride ceramic are used in performance <b>bearings.</b> A representative example is use of silicon nitride <b>bearings</b> in the main engines of the NASA's Space Shuttle.|$|R

50|$|In {{the second}} stage, the <b>bearings</b> of Structures 1 through 5 were repaired. The heavily {{polluted}} roller <b>bearings</b> were completely replaced. The needle <b>bearings</b> (compact roller <b>bearings)</b> were opened and cleaned and the abrasive contact surfaces were reground. The <b>bearings</b> were then greased and closed again.|$|R
50|$|Compared {{to other}} rolling-element <b>bearings,</b> slewing <b>bearings</b> are thin in section {{and are often}} made in {{diameter}}s of a metre or more; the slewing <b>bearings</b> on the Falkirk Wheel are 4 metres diameter and fit over a 3.5 metre axle.
