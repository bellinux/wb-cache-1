50|$|The {{microenterprise}} {{field has}} a twenty-year {{history in the}} United States. While the term “microenterprise” was in common use internationally by the late 1970s, it came <b>into</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>use</b> within the United States about a decade later. Traditionally, the business sector had been categorized into three groups: large, medium, and small. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a small business as having up to 500 employees. In 1991, the SBA recognized microenterprise as a separate or distinct category of business.|$|R

The line through the station was closed in 1968 when freight traffic ceased at Gravesend West. What remained was swept away when the trackbed of the Gravesend Branch from Vale Road as far as Gravesend West was converted into the A2260 Thames Way. The cutting was deepened and widened requiring the demolition of the dilapidated stationmaster's house. Only the former railway tunnel to the north-east of the station, {{now part of the}} A2260, remains as the surviving remnant of the railway which once served Rosherville.|$|R

40|$|To revisit global net {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) {{emissions}} transfers by international trade for year 2007, this study employs a new world-wide, multiregional input-output (MRIO) table in which China's production is separated <b>into</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>use,</b> processing exports, and nonprocessing exports. The {{results show that}} processing exports in China involves relatively lower CO 2 emissions than other production types for the same output levels. Therefore, if processing exports are not appropriately distinguished, net CO 2 emission exports from China to other regions will be distorted; the relative bias occasionally reaches 15 %. Net emission exports from regions other than China are also distorted, particularly for regions that use considerable Chinese processing exports as intermediates, such as the United States, European Union (EU), and East Asia. Given that processing exports prevail in {{a large number of}} developing countries, such as Mexico and Vietnam, one should carefully interpret measurements of net emission transfers by international trade by utilizing the ordinary world-wide MRIO model...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, a new resolve for both {{increased}} economic integration and monetary and exchange rate cooperation has started to emerge in ASEAN, most notably since the 1997 - 1998 Asian financial crisis. This thesis addresses {{the question of whether}} there are sufficient economic reasons to justify such a move. The first chapter presents an historical overview of the integration process in ASEAN to date and the main motivations for the study. The following two chapters present a review of the main theory (Chapter II) and empirical works (Chapter III) on optimum currency areas and present the basis {{for the remainder of the}} study. The fourth chapter investigates whether structural shocks among ASEAN countries are becoming more symmetrical over time, thus verifying whether this region is becoming better prepared to introduce a common currency. The fifth chapter studies the degree of relative price adjustment in ASEAN by providing a study on the degree of exchange rate pass-through <b>into</b> <b>domestic</b> prices, <b>using</b> the distribution chain of pricing. This study includes, for the first time, all five founding members of ASEAN (ASEAN 5) and draws inferences on their suitability for further monetary cooperation. The sixth chapter researches whether the recorded increase in intra-ASEAN trade is moving ASEAN members towards closer economic integration by applying a new panel data methodology.

40|$|In many {{applications}} {{the study of}} human movement using a computer is very useful. One such application is the three-dimensional reconstruction {{of the structure of}} the human body and its movement using sequences of images and graphic models. For this reconstruction to be accurate and precise the person analyzed and the virtual human (humanoid) must have similar anthropometric characteristics. A process is therefore defined that attempts to adjust the humanoid to the morphology of the person, a process which can be very laborious and subjective if done manually or by selection of points. This paper presents a system of human motion analysis and animation that can apply a semiautomatic or interactive matching between person and humanoid. Once this process is carried out we are ready to analyze and represent the movements under study. The study is adapted to specific sports activities or dance training, but is possible to extend to human tracking and identification or computer animation productions. In these cases the adjustment process can be assisted by the computer. At present, it is used in indoor spaces, but its use in outdoor spaces is also intended. The system requires no markers or special clothing to be worn by the athlete or sports participant, and its range of application is therefore very wide. Also very important are its portability <b>into</b> <b>domestic</b> environments <b>using</b> VRML 2. 0 and the H-anim standard for specification of virtual humanoids. This advantage is very important because experts can visualize movements on any personal computer with a commercial Internet browser...|$|R
