25|$|Sir Robert Holmes (ca. 1622 – 18 November 1692) was an English Admiral of the Restoration Navy. He {{took part}} {{in the second and third}} Anglo-Dutch wars, both of which he is, by some, {{credited}} with having started. He was made governor of the Isle of Wight, where he is buried in Yarmouth parish church. Holmes is chiefly remembered for his exploits on the cruise to Guinea (1664) for the Royal African Company, and for the so-called Holmes's <b>Bonfire</b> <b>of</b> 1666. He is regarded as an archetypal figure both of the quarrelsome restoration officer and of the coming into being of the British professional naval officer.|$|E
25|$|In early September 1860, {{in a field}} behind Gad's Hill, Dickens made a <b>bonfire</b> <b>of</b> most of his correspondence—only {{those letters}} on {{business}} matters were spared. Since Ellen Ternan also destroyed all of his letters to her, {{the extent of the}} affair between the two remains speculative. In the 1930s, Thomas Wright recounted that Ternan had unburdened herself with a Canon Benham, and gave currency to rumours they had been lovers. That the two had a son who died in infancy was alleged by Dickens's daughter, Kate Perugini, whom Gladys Storey had interviewed before her death in 1929. Storey published her account in Dickens and Daughter, but no contemporary evidence exists. On his death, Dickens settled an annuity on Ternan which made her a financially independent woman. Claire Tomalin's book, The Invisible Woman, argues that Ternan lived with Dickens secretly for the last 13 years of his life. The book was subsequently turned into a play, Little Nell, by Simon Gray, and a 2013 film.|$|E

25|$|Henrietta Maria {{paused for}} a period at York, where she was entertained in some style by the Earl of Newcastle. Henrietta Maria took the {{opportunity}} to discuss the situation north of the border with Royalist Scots, promoting the plans of Montrose and others for an uprising. She also supported the Earl of Antrim's proposals to settle the rebellion in Ireland and bring forces across the sea to support the King in England. Henrietta Maria continued to vigorously argue for nothing less than a total victory over Charles' enemies, countering proposals for a compromise. She rejected private messages from Pym and Hampden asking her to use her influence over the King to create a peace treaty, and was impeached by Parliament shortly afterwards. Meanwhile, Parliament had voted to destroy her private chapel at Somerset House and arrest the Capuchin friars who maintained it. In March, Henry Marten and John Clotworthy forced their way into the chapel with troops and destroyed the altarpiece by Rubens, smashed many of the statues and made a <b>bonfire</b> <b>of</b> the Queen's religious canvases, books and vestments.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} six, {{she made}} her feature film debut in a minor role in Woody Allen's short film Oedipus Wrecks that was {{released}} as one-third of the anthology film New York Stories (1989). Soon after, she co-starred with Tom Hanks in the comedy-drama The <b>Bonfire</b> <b>of</b> the Vanities (1990), based on Tom Wolfe's novel of the same name, where she played the daughter of Hanks' character. In 1993, Dunst guest-starred on the science fiction drama [...] in season 7: episode 7 titled [...] "Dark Page" [...] as Hedril.|$|E
500|$|Although Winona Ryder was {{the first}} cast member {{attached}} to the script, Dianne Wiest {{was the first}} to sign on. [...] "Dianne, in particular, was wonderful", Burton said. [...] "She was the first actress to read the script, supported it completely and, because she is so respected, once she had given it her stamp of approval, others soon got interested". When it came to casting the lead role of Edward, several actors were considered; Fox was insistent on having Burton meet with Tom Cruise. [...] "He certainly wasn't my ideal, but I talked to him", Burton remembered. [...] "He was interesting, but I think it worked out for the best. A lot of questions came up". Cruise asked for a [...] "happier" [...] ending. Gary Oldman and Tom Hanks turned down the part, the latter in favor of critical and commercial flop The <b>Bonfire</b> <b>of</b> the Vanities. Oldman declined as he found the story absurd, but said of the finished film: [...] "Literally two minutes in, I went, 'Yeah, I get it'. I just got it too late." [...] Jim Carrey was also considered for the role, while Thompson favored John Cusack. Elsewhere, William Hurt, Robert Downey Jr. and musician Michael Jackson expressed interest, although Burton neglected to converse with Jackson.|$|E
500|$|Rubin's work on Jacob's Ladder {{began in}} 1980, sparked by his {{nightmare}} {{in which he}} dreamt about being trapped in a subway. For several years, Rubin tried to sell the script, without success; Thom Mount of Universal Pictures said he [...] "loved it, {{but it was not}} for his studio". Directors Michael Apted, Sidney Lumet and Ridley Scott all expressed an interest in making the film, but still no major studio was ready to invest in Rubin's [...] "too metaphysical" [...] stories as [...] "Hollywood does not make ghost movies". Eventually, after Deadly Friend was filmed by Wes Craven in 1986, Rubin's screenplays for both Jacob's Ladder and Ghost were picked by Paramount Pictures. In 1988, Adrian Lyne, who described Rubin's work as [...] "certainly one of the best scripts I've ever read", decided then to direct it instead of an adaptation of The <b>Bonfire</b> <b>of</b> the Vanities as he had originally planned (incidentally, Tom Hanks, an actor originally considered by Lyne for the role of Jacob, ended up starring in Bonfire). The ownership and policy changes at Paramount resulted in the cancellation of the project; the executives had doubts about the film's ending and the scenes taking place in Vietnam. The independent film studio Carolco Pictures decided to take over the production of Jacob's Ladder, giving Lyne a greater creative control and a budget of $25 million. Rubin became the film's co-producer, along with Mario Kassar, Alan Marshall and Andrew G. Vajna.|$|E

500|$|Work {{continued}} on the screenplay from 2003 onwards, {{taking place in}} the small bungalow where Groening first pitched The Simpsons in 1987. The writers spent six months discussing a plot, and each of them offered sketchy ideas. Jean suggested the family rescue manatees, which became the 2005 episode [...] "The <b>Bonfire</b> <b>of</b> the Manatees", and there was also a notion similar to that of The Truman Show where the characters discovered their lives were a TV show. Groening rejected this, as he felt that the Simpsons should [...] "never become aware of themselves as celebrities", but the idea was later used in the video game The Simpsons Game. Groening read about a town that had to get rid of pig feces in their water supply, which inspired the plot of the film. The decision for Flanders to have an important role also came early on, as Jean wished to see Bart wonder what his life would be like if Flanders were his father. Hank Scorpio, a character from the 1996 episode [...] "You Only Move Twice", was originally meant to return as the main antagonist, but the staff dropped the idea and created Russ Cargill instead. Having eventually decided on the basic outline of the plot for the film, the writers then separated it into seven sections. Jean, Scully, Reiss, Swartzwelder, Vitti, Mirkin, and Meyer wrote 25 pages each, and the group met one month later to merge the seven sections into one [...] "very rough draft". The film's script was written {{in the same way as}} the television series: the writers sitting around a table, pitching ideas, and trying to make each other laugh. The script went through over 100 revisions, and at one point the film was a musical. However, the songs were continually being shortened and the idea was dropped. Groening described his desire to also make the film dramatically stronger than a TV episode, saying that he wanted to [...] "give you something that you haven't seen before".|$|E
