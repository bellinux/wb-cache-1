Subjects and methods: The study included fourty patients, age ranged from 40 to 50 year, divided into two groups. The first group with mean age 48. 2 ± 6. 59 years followed a physical therapy program of exercises in the form of isolated stretching of back, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, and iliopsoas muscles; and strengthening exercises for the abdominal muscles, three sessions per week for three months.

40|$|Two-dimensional Fourier Transform (2 D FT) {{spectroscopy}} in the short-wave infrared (1 - 2 2 ̆ 6 mu) enables {{high frequency}} and time resolution experiments of molecular dyes, third-generation photovoltaic systems, and carotenoids - all rich in electronic transitions in this spectral region. Such experiments require short pulses with broad spectra to probe fast dephasing or solvation dynamics {{as well as}} couplings between widely spaced electronic transitions. Stable, low-dispersion interferometers at Brewster 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>angle</b> are introduced for multioctave-spanning nonlinear spectroscopies. We adapt a compact, phase-characterized Mach-Zehnder interferometer to the short-wave infrared; active stabilization produces accurate and evenly spaced time delays between the two excitation pulses in 2 D FT spectroscopy. An intrinsically phase-stable Sagnac interferometer is introduced to enhance the interferometric signal detection {{with respect to the}} copropagating local oscillator in partially collinear 2 D FT spectroscopy. These interferometers exploit the air-glass interface Brewster 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>angle</b> of thin-film metallic beam splitters to preserve expected output phase shifts and to minimize secondary reflections over multiple octaves. A homebuilt short-wave IR noncollinear optical parametric amplifier with a periodically poled crystal provides broadband excitation and detection. The output pulses are compressed with a deformable mirror using second-harmonic generation feedback in a genetic algorithm to pulse durations as low as 10 fs. Together this light source and the interferometric 2 D spectrometer have enabled the first 2 D FT electronic spectroscopy in this wavelength range; we analyze the early time solvation dynamics of IR- 26 dye. Agreement between experimental and simulated purely absorptive 2 D spectra of this dye proves the feasibility of the spectrometer design. Accurate evolution time delays in the partially collinear geometry reduce ambiguities in the phasing of these 2 D spectra. Finally, initial 2 D spectra of lead chalcogenide quantum dots exhibit first exciton transition (bleach) peaks; weak negative peaks potentially reflect biexciton shifts. These spectra lay the groundwork for broadband 2 D FT spectroscopy to find exciton couplings and dephasing rates to help establish the mechanism of carrier multiplication for high-efficiency photovoltaics...|$|R
