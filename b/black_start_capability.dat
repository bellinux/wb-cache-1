40|$|Concentrating {{solar power}} (CSP) is a {{complementary}} {{technology to the}} solar photovoltaic (PV) process. It uses concentrating collectors to provide high temperature heat to a conventional power cycle. Efficient and low-cost thermal energy storage technologies can be integrated into CSP systems, allowing electricity production according to the demand profile. CSP systems can also avoid “shadow plant capacity” needed to secure generation capacity in periods without sunshine or wind, can provide grid services, and if desired even <b>black</b> <b>start</b> <b>capabilities.</b> It thus supports the penetration of a high share of intermittent renewable sources like wind or PV and avoids a high share of expensive electric storage technology in the grid systems. The first commercial implementation of CSP technology began in 2007 in Spain and the US. Today, a capacity of 3 GW is in operation and another 2 GW are under construction worldwide. Further developments, in particular in the Middle East and North Africa but also in South Africa, India and China, are under consideration [...] This chapter summarizes the principle, the technical requirements and the different technological concepts of CSP systems. It briefly reports {{on the state of}} the art of today’s solar power plants including the current cost of solar electricity. In addition, the most relevant aspects for future cost reductions are highlighted. Furthermore, the worldwide potential impact of this technology, to 2050, is discussed, together with comments on the option of high voltage direct current transmission allowing electricity to be transported from countries in the sunbelt to densely populated areas in developed countries. Finally, the option the production of solar fuel in solar high temperature processes is discussed...|$|R

Traditiona <b>black</b> <b>start</b> sometimes may suffer from inflexible <b>black</b> <b>start</b> units and overvoltage and serious oscillation.

For a <b>black</b> <b>start</b> with high voltage and long-distance transmission lines, it is much easier to cause phenomena such as self-excitation and power frequency/operating overvoltage, which may lead to <b>black</b> <b>start</b> failure and impact the reliability of the system’s restoration.

Thus, the DGs with good <b>black</b> <b>start</b> <b>capability,</b> which are selected by a diversity sequence method, are restored first in parallel under the constraints of DGs and network. During the selection process of recovery paths, line weight and node importance degree are proposed under the consideration of the node topological importance and the load importance as well as the backbone network restoration time. Therefore, the whole optimization of the reconstructed network is realized. Finally, the simulation results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the strategy...|$|E
