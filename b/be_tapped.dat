5|$|As in {{the colonial}} period, the Pine Bush {{continued}} to <b>be</b> <b>tapped</b> for its natural resources, with water becoming a target for development. The Patroon Creek, roughly where three feeder streams joined {{in the heart of}} the Pine Bush along Albany's northern border, was dammed in 1850 to form Rensselaer Lake waterworks.|$|E
5|$|Ptolemy II Philadelphus, {{emperor of}} Ptolemaic Egypt, may have forged an {{alliance}} with the Lihyanites {{in order to secure}} the incense route at Dedan, thereby rerouting the incense trade from Dedan to the coast along the Red Sea to Egypt. I. E. S. Edwards connects the Syro-Ephraimite War to the desire of the Israelites and the Aramaeans to control the northern end of the Incense route, which ran up from Southern Arabia and could <b>be</b> <b>tapped</b> by commanding Transjordan.|$|E
5|$|At the 1932 occasion, Tesla {{claimed he}} had invented a motor that would run on cosmic rays. In 1933, at age 77, Tesla told reporters that, after thirty-five years of work, {{he was on the}} verge of {{producing}} proof of a new form of energy. He claimed it was a theory of energy that was “violently opposed” to Einsteinian physics, and could <b>be</b> <b>tapped</b> with an apparatus that would be cheap to run and last 500 years. He also told reporters he was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.|$|E
30|$|When a plate <b>is</b> <b>tapped,</b> many {{vibration}} modes such as flexural, torsional, longitudinal {{and other}} vibrations appear. The resonance frequencies of the flexural vibration modes, {{those of the}} torsional vibration modes and longitudinal vibration modes can be identified easily: when a rectangular bar <b>is</b> <b>tapped</b> along its edge line, a frequency spectrum of complex vibrations of bending and twisting occurs. By contrast, when the bar <b>is</b> <b>tapped</b> along its center line, pure bending vibration occurs [10, 11].|$|R

5|$|Red maple is {{also used}} for the {{production}} of maple syrup, though the hard maples Acer saccharum (sugar maple) and Acer nigrum (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the red maple, {{as well as those of}} the Acer saccharinum (silver maple), Acer negundo (boxelder), and Acer platanoides (Norway maple), and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This being the case, red maple can only <b>be</b> <b>tapped</b> for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.|$|E
5|$|Professor Layton and the Last Specter is {{a puzzle}} game {{presented}} {{in the style of}} an adventure game. The player controls the actions of a group of three protagonists as they move about a village called Misthallery: Professor Hershel Layton, his assistant Emmy Altava, and a young boy named Luke Triton. While in the village, the three of them are presented with several mysteries that are solved as the plot progresses. Misthallery is divided into several sections, although many require the plot to progress to a certain point before they can be accessed. In order to move about Misthallery, players tap a shoe-shaped icon on the bottom-right corner of the touch screen, and then the arrow representing the direction of the path they wish to take. While in Misthallery, the player is capable of tapping anywhere on the bottom screen of the Nintendo DS system to investigate objects and reveal bits of dialogue, hint coins, collectible items, or hidden puzzles. Likewise, if a non-player character is visible on the screen, they can <b>be</b> <b>tapped</b> to initiate a conversation.|$|E

25|$|Zamboanga City {{relies heavily}} on surface water from the Tumaga River for its water supply. The ZCWD is serving only 48% of the total {{population}} of the total water production, 38% is accounted water.

25|$|Secret sharing schemes are {{important}} in cloud computing environments. Thus a key can be distributed over many servers by a threshold secret sharing mechanism. The key is then reconstructed when needed. Secret sharing has also been suggested for sensor networks where the links are liable to <b>be</b> <b>tapped</b> by sending the data in shares which makes {{the task of the}} eavesdropper harder. The security in such environments can be made greater by continuous changing of the way the shares are constructed.|$|E
25|$|Fresh oysters must {{be alive}} just before {{consumption}} or cooking. There {{is only one}} criterion: the oyster must be capable of tightly closing its shell. Open oysters should <b>be</b> <b>tapped</b> on the shell; a live oyster will close up and is safe to eat. Oysters which are open and unresponsive are dead and must be discarded. Some dead oysters, or oyster shells which are full of sand may be closed. These make a distinctive noise when tapped, and are known as 'clackers'.|$|E

Venomous fish {{tend to be}} either very visible, using flamboyant colours to warn enemies, or skilfully camouflaged and maybe buried in the sand. Apart from the defence or hunting value, venom might have value for bottom dwelling fish by killing the bacteria that try to invade their skin. Few of these venoms have been studied.

25|$|The main {{rivers that}} flow entirely inside Lebanon are the Litani river (average annual flow of 0.79 million cubic meter), the Ibrahim River (0.51), the Awali River and the Damour River (both 0.3). A {{large share of}} the Litani River is {{diverted}} through the Markaba tunnel for hydropower generation to the Awali River. Since the upper watershed of the Litani River is polluted and the Awali River is due to <b>be</b> <b>tapped</b> {{as a source of}} drinking water supply for Beirut, this water transfer has implications beyond its intended use for hydropower generation.|$|E
25|$|All {{microwave}} generators {{of the era}} worked along similar principles; electrons {{were pulled}} off a cathode towards an anode {{at the far end}} of a tube. Along the way, they passed one or more resonators, essentially hollow copper rings with a slit cut along the inner edge. As the electrons passed the slit, they caused the resonator to resonate with radio energy, which could <b>be</b> <b>tapped</b> off as a signal. The frequency could be adjusted by controlling the speed of the electrons (via the applied voltage) or by changing the dimensions of the resonator.|$|E

25|$|North American birders were {{estimated}} to have spent as much as US$32 billion in 2001. The spending {{is on the rise}} around the world. Kuşcenneti National Park (KNP) at Lake Manyas, a Ramsar site in Turkey was estimated to attract birders who spent as much as US$103,320,074 annually. Guided bird tours have become a major business with at least 127 companies offering tours worldwide. An average trip to a less-developed country costs $4000 per person and includes about 12 participants for each of 150 trips a year. It has been suggested that this economic potential needs to <b>be</b> <b>tapped</b> for conservation.|$|E
25|$|On 9 July 1941, President Roosevelt asked Frank Knox, the Secretary of the Navy, and Henry L. Stimson, the Secretary of War, for an {{exploration}} of the total war production required for the United States to prevail in case of war. The WPD, in order to project long-term numbers, realized that Rainbow 5 would now be used as a basis for production quantities, but it lacked detailed air power figures. Stimson requested of Robert A. Lovett, Assistant Secretary of War for Air, that the USAAF <b>be</b> <b>tapped</b> for their ideas about production numbers. After some bureaucratic delay, the AWPD received the request.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{ideology}} of the Sandinistas put the future of the private sector and of private ownership of the means of production in doubt. Although under the new government both public and private ownership were accepted, government spokespersons occasionally referred to a reconstruction phase in the country's development, in which property owners and the professional class would <b>be</b> <b>tapped</b> for their managerial and technical expertise. After reconstruction and recovery, the private sector would give way to expanded public ownership in most areas of the economy. Despite such ideas, which represented {{the point of view of}} a faction of the government, the Sandinista government remained officially committed to a mixed economy.|$|E
