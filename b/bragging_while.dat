5000|$|Brancaccio {{was brought}} to the court at Ferrara by Duke Alfonso II d'Este {{specifically}} in order to sing for his musica secreta, where he was highly prized as a skilled bass. According to one contemporary commentator, part of the agreement when Brancacio was brought in was that he was [...] "not to talk of his miracles of war." [...] Alfonso and Brancaccio did not get along very well, due in part to Brancaccio's resistance to being seen as a professional musician, a position he viewed as lower-status, more akin to that of a servant than a full member of the court, and in part because of Alfonso's impatience with Brancaccio's tendency to <b>brag.</b> <b>While</b> Brancaccio was in the duke's employ he received around 400 scudi per year (in 1582 this was 130 lire per month) as well as a house and horses whenever he wanted or had use for them. During this period Torquato Tasso and Giovanni Battista Guarini wrote poems in Brancaccio's honor.|$|R

DeVol killed policemen Ira Leon Evans and Leo Gorski during the escape. Fred murdered civilian Oscar Erickson, who was in a passing car when he saw the gang. Fred shot him as the car drove past them. Fred and Karpis were also suspected of killing Ma Barker's lover Arthur Dunlop, whom they considered to be untrustworthy after someone tipped police to the gangs hideout.

40|$|Bragging about brands {{on social}} media is pervasive. When bragging about brands, communicators face a {{trade-off}} between enhancing perceptions of their competence versus lowering perceptions of their warmth or likability. Likewise, for brands, bragging can increase the brand’s visibility but can convey negative brand-user imagery that detracts from the equity of the brand. Across four experimental studies, this dissertation shows how signaling brand attachment moderates the effects of brand-related bragging on both the perceptions of communicators and brand-user imagery. Results from the first two studies show that mentioning a high status brand in social media communications leads to negative evaluations when the communicator is not seen as attached to the brand, and positive evaluations when brand attachment is signaled. Using brand attachment cues <b>while</b> <b>bragging</b> leads the audience to infer that the communicator talks about the brand because of intrinsic motives such as personal enjoyment, versus extrinsic motives such as status-signaling, resulting in favorable communicator impressions and brand-user imagery. The last two {{studies show that the}} beneficial effects of using brand attachment cues <b>while</b> <b>bragging</b> are mitigated if the cues are seen as non-credible or non-diagnostic of motives in a particular communication context. This research develops a theoretical framework for brand-related bragging and suggests practical ways to manage the trade-offs involved for both communicators and brands. Further, it opens new avenues for research by providing a social perception lens on consumer-brand relationships and showing that there are benefits of signaling one’s brand attachment for both consumers and brands in terms of impressions formed by the audience. 2018 - 06 - 22 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R
5000|$|Similar {{symbols are}} used in {{chapters}} 2 and 7 concerning the first kingdom of both. Speaking to Nebuchadnezzar in chapter 2 Daniel said, [...] "You are the king of kings, ... in your hands he has placed all mankind and the beasts {{of the field and}} the birds in the sky." [...] In Chapter 7 Daniel said, [...] "The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle, ... it stood on two feet like a human being, and the mind of a human was given to it." [...] The related terms are mankind with human being, beast of the field with lion (king of beasts), and bird with eagle. The lion therefore denotes, according to Smith, the same kingdom as the head of gold of the great image. The parallel is strengthened by another story in the book of Daniel. <b>While</b> <b>bragging</b> about himself, Nebuchadnezzar [...] "lost his mind", he [...] "lived with the wild beasts of the field, a king among beasts, his hair was like feathers of an eagle, his nails were like claws of a bird." [...] After a period of time, [...] "he raised his eyes to heaven and praised the Most High. Immediately his sanity was restored, his advisers and nobles restored him to the throne." [...] Thus Douchan states that the first beast, the lion, corresponds to the first kingdom of the statue, namely Bablylon.|$|R
40|$|The BRAG/IQSEC is {{a family}} of guanine {{nucleotide}} exchange factors for ADP ribosylation factors, small GTPases that regulate membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton, and comprises three structurally related members (BRAG 1 - 3) generated from different genes. In the mouse retina, BRAG 1 (also known as IQSEC 2) was previously shown to localize at synaptic ribbons of photoreceptor terminals and to form a protein complex with RIBEYE. In this study, we examined the immunohistochemical localization of BRAG 2 (IQSEC 1) and BRAG 3 (IQSEC 3) in the adult mouse retina at the light and electron microscopic levels. In the outer plexiform layer, BRAG 2 showed a punctate distribution in intimate association with dystrophin and β-dystroglycan. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis revealed that BRAG 2 localized at specific subcompartments of photoreceptor terminals in both rod spherules and cone pedicles. In the inner plexiform layer, immunolabeling for both BRAG 2 and BRAG 3 had a punctate appearance, suggestive of synaptic labeling. Double immunostaining demonstrated that BRAG 2 colocalized preferentially with PSD- 95 and α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionate-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). By contrast, BRAG 3 colocalized with gephyrin and a subpopulation of inhibitory synapses expressing glycine receptors or γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs). Immunoelectron microscopic analysis revealed that BRAG 2 localized to postsynaptic processes at bipolar dyads, <b>while</b> <b>BRAG</b> 3 localized to postsynaptic components at conventional synapses. These findings suggest that BRAG/IQSEC family members have key roles in the function and organization of distinct excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the retina. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

While Taskmaster and several Sinister Six members cause chaos, the Goblin steals the Siege Perilous from S.H.I.E.L.D. and escapes through a portal. In the four-part [...] "Spider-Verse" [...] episodes, the Goblin imprisons Electro in the Siege Perilous {{as a living}} power source so he can travel the Marvel Multiverse to acquire DNA samples from {{alternate}} reality versions of Spider-Man for a 'very special purpose'. With Spider-Man pursuing him, he first arrives to Marvel 2099 to get a blood sample from a futuristic successor to Spider-Man, then a gender-swapped universe where he enlists his female counterpart Norma Osborn (voiced by Wendie Malick) on the original Green Goblin incarnation to help with Spider-Girl {{in return for a}} vial of his Goblin serum for her own use. The Goblin then gets a blood sample from Spider-Man Noir, a chin-hair from Spider-Ham, and another blood sample from Spyder-Knight. The Goblin arrives to another alternate universe to get the blood of the Ultimate Spider-Man while finding himself attacked by a winged, demonic Green Goblin. During all this, he finally figures out his nemesis's identity via that world's Peter Parker's gravestone. He then pools all of the alternate Spider-Men DNA into a serum to gain spider-like abilities, engaging in a winning fight with Spider-Man <b>while</b> <b>bragging</b> about knowing the web-slinger's secret identity. The Goblin joyfully threatens Peter's loved ones, however, Spider-Man tries to deter Osborn from his own son's harm, but the Goblin no longer sees himself as Norman, angrily stating that love is a weakness and that he 'loves no one'. Just then, the serum further mutates him, transforming into the Spider-Goblin. The even more deranged Spider-Goblin battles the Web-Warriors until Spider-Man manages to turns him back to his human form again with Electro's help. Norman is later seen in a retirement home after he lost his memories as Goblin (and Spider-Man's identity), happily greeting Peter and Harry as the two youths come to visit him. The Green Goblin also appears in the episode [...] "A Nightmare on Christmas". In an alternate reality that Peter gave up being Spider-Man to be rich, the Goblin now rules New York with his own army of Spider-Soldiers as personal enforcers. At the bigger and threatening Oscorp tower, Spider-Man encounters a horned, suited version that now calls himself the Goblin King. Having defeated and killed most of the Earth's heroes, he has the Avengers' equipment as trophies (i.e. Iron Man's armor, Black Widow's gauntlets, Captain America's shield, Falcon's wings, and even Thor's Mjolnir). After an intense battle, Spider-Man defeats the Goblin King before learning this reality is actually Nightmare's illusion. In the four-part [...] "Contests of Champions" [...] season finale, Norman can be occasionally seen as one of the people held hostage as Spider-Man's motivation for the 'game' between the Collector and the Grandmaster.|$|R
50|$|As {{the war of}} {{the five}} kings progresses, Sansa's {{position}} in Kings Landing becomes more perilous. On Joffrey's name day celebration, Sansa saves an inebriated Ser Dontos Hollard from execution, convincing Joffrey to instead make Dontos his fool. While at the celebration, Tyrion offers his condolences for Ned's death, in which Sansa insists her family are all traitors and that she is loyal to Joffrey. Later on, when her eldest brother Robb wins a battle against the Lannisters, Sansa is publicly beaten and humiliated {{in front of the}} court by Joffrey and Ser Meryn (on Joffrey's orders), as payment for her brother's crimes. Tyrion Lannister enters the court and rescues Sansa. Despite being a dwarf, Tyrion takes pity on Sansa's situation, and offers to have the engagement called off. Sansa maintains her facade that she is loyal to Joffrey, which impresses Tyrion to the point of believing Sansa might just survive Kings Landing. Tyrion has his lover, Shae, positioned as Sansa's handmaiden. Sansa and Shae form a friendship, in which Sansa is able to vent about her hatred of the Lannisters without fear of being revealed. Sansa is present when the royal family bids farewell to Joffrey's sister, Myrcella, on her departure to Dorne to form an alliance between the Lannisters and the Martells. While returning to the Red Keep, a riot breaks out in the streets of Kings Landing, amidst which Sansa finds herself caught in the fray. Three peasant men chase Sansa and attempt to rape her, before she is rescued and returned to the castle by Sandor Clegane. The following morning, Sansa has a nightmare of the incident, and wakes up in a bloodstained bed. Sansa had flowered, which meant she could bear Joffrey children. Sansa and Shae attempt to conceal this, which involved Shae threatening to kill a witness handmaiden if she told anyone. However, Sandor Clegane sees the blood, and both Cersei and Joffrey are informed. Cersei invites Sansa to her chambers to share some of her wisdom and experience as a wife and a mother. Cersei reminisces that her husband Robert was not interested in her giving childbirth. Cersei explains to Sansa that while Sansa may never love Joffrey (and vice versa), she will love his children. Cersei warns Sansa that the more people she loves, the weaker she will be. Therefore, Sansa should only love her children, as it is the only love she has no choice in. Before the battle of the Blackwater, Joffrey forces Sansa to kiss the blade of his sword, <b>while</b> <b>bragging</b> he will kill Stannis himself. Sansa implicitly taunts Joffrey by remarking he must be battling in the vanguard (which of course he would not be). Joffrey responds to this by insisting Sansa will kiss the blade again with Stannis' blood on it. During the battle, Sansa takes refuge with Cersei, Shae and the other women and children of Kings Landing. A drunk Cersei openly torments Sansa and the women. She does this by explaining that if the city falls, they will all be raped and have bastards in their bellies come morning. Cersei continues her taunting by also telling Sansa that tears are not the only weapons women have; the greatest weapon they own are between their legs. Following Cersei's departure from the refuge with Tommen, Sansa leaves to hide in her bedchamber, where she finds Sandor Clegane. Sandor, about to leave Kings Landing, offers to take Sansa home. Sansa declines, insisting Stannis would not harm her. After the battle is won by the Lannister-Tyrell forces, Loras Tyrell asks Joffrey to take his sister, Margaery, as his bride. Joffrey accepts the proposal, which annuls his marriage with Sansa. Sansa, while pretending to be devastated, is secretly delighted she no longer has to marry Joffrey. However Petyr Baelish warns that while Sansa is no longer engaged, Joffrey would have greater reign to abuse Sansa, especially now she is a woman. Petyr assures Sansa he will help get her home, in which Sansa once again displays a facade, asserting Kings Landing is her home. Petyr advises Sansa that everyone in Kings Landing is a liar, and that they are much more cunning at it than her.|$|R
