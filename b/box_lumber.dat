San Francisco became the center of the lumber business and Johnson operated an office at 1 Montgomery Street, in the Crocker Bank Building. Unfortunately, his friends and partners in the box company were not eager to branch out. Tartar and Webster sold out to Johnson, keeping the Stockton Box Company under their own guidance. Several years later, the three reunited as Johnson's vision began to pay off. The reunited corporation became the American Forest Products Corporation.|$|R

In 1957, through an exchange of stock, the Kieckhefer holdings were merged with the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company of Tacoma, Washington. The Kieckhefer Container Co. was moved to Camden, New Jersey, in about 1950. The Milwaukee, Wisconsin operations of the Eddy Paper Co. were closed in 1952.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to examine the basic properties (anatomical structure, chemical, physical and mechanical) of saling-saling wood (Artocarpus teysmanii Miq.) taken from natural forest in Luwu Timur District, South Sulawesi Province. The Potential uses of this wood was determined by considering those properties and wood uses currently employed by the local inhabitants. Results revealed that saling-saling had clearly distinct heartwood and sapwood, sapwood yellowish white and heartwood yellowish brown in colour, figure on tangential sections sometimes show discontinuous dark coloured ribbons, fine or uneven texture, straight grain and sometimes rather interlocked, glossy wood surface, rough surface, and moderate in hardness, the fiber is remarkably long with very thin wall thickness, and this fiber quality is classified in class II for manufacturing paper pulp. The chemical content is composed of high cellulose, low pentose, moderate lignin, high extractive, moderate ash and high silicate. Saling-saling is a light wood with a specific gravity of 0. 40, very low in shrinkage and classified as a class III wood strength. Potential uses are for light construction material, canoe/boat, cheap furniture, handicraft, veneer for plywood, laminated <b>lumber,</b> <b>boxes,</b> concrete forms, particle board, fiber board and paper pulp...|$|R
60|$|The attic was no {{pleasant}} place: I {{believe he}} did not know how unpleasant it was, or he never would have locked me in with so little ceremony. In this summer weather, it was hot as Africa; as in winter, it was always cold as Greenland. <b>Boxes</b> and <b>lumber</b> filled it; old dresses draped its unstained wall--cobwebs its unswept ceiling. Well was it known to be tenanted by rats, by black beetles, and by cockroaches--nay, rumour affirmed that the ghostly Nun of the garden had once been seen here. A partial darkness obscured one end, across which, as for deeper mystery, an old russet curtain was drawn, by way of screen to a sombre band of winter cloaks, pendent each from its pin, like a malefactor from his gibbet. From amongst these cloaks, and behind that curtain, the Nun was said to issue. I did not believe this, nor was I troubled by apprehension thereof; but I saw a very dark and large rat, with a long tail, come gliding out from that squalid alcove; and, moreover, my eye fell on many a black-beetle, dotting the floor. These objects discomposed me more, perhaps, than it would be wise to say, as also did the dust, lumber, and stifling heat of the place. The last inconvenience would soon have become intolerable, had I not found means to open and prop up the skylight, thus admitting some freshness. Underneath this aperture I pushed a large empty chest, and having mounted upon it a smaller box, and wiped from both the dust, I gathered my dress (my best, the reader must remember, and therefore a legitimate object of care) fastidiously around me, ascended this species of extempore throne, and being seated, commenced the acquisition of my task; while I learned, not forgetting to keep a sharp look-out on the black-beetles and cockroaches, of which, more even, I believe, than of the rats, I sat in mortal dread.|$|R

50|$|Tar Hollow State Park is a {{state park}} located in Laurelville, Ohio, United States. It {{is part of a}} larger {{protected}} complex with Tar Hollow State Forest. Surrounded by the rugged foothills of the Appalachian Plateau, Tar Hollow's twisting park and forest roads pass through deep ravines and dense woodlands. Scattered shortleaf and pitch pines growing on the ridges were once the source of pine tar for early settlers, hence the name Tar Hollow. Dogwoods, redbuds and a variety of wildflowers color the hillsides in the springtime. The Fall pageant of colors is spectacular.At one time, Ohio was covered by a warm, shallow sea. As land rose to the east, sand and gravel were washed westward into Ohio's waters. Southeastern Ohio's sandstone was formed from this sediment. These sandstone hills are covered with a rich, diverse forest. Oak and hickory prefer the dry ridge tops of the area, while sycamore, black willow, buckeye and silver maple line the stream valleys. The forest not only supports a variety of hardwoods but also contains a vast array of ferns, mosses, mushrooms and wildflowers. Bloodroot, wild geranium, cardinal flower and Solomon's seal are typical wildflowers found in the forest. Surrounded by the rugged foothills of the Appalachian Plateau, Tar Hollow State Park and surrounding state forest are characteristic of the wilderness that blanketed Ohio in the days of early settlers. It is a stronghold for many exciting species of wildlife. Numerous reptiles and amphibians, colorful game birds, songbirds and secretive mammals can be found here. The timber rattlesnake, dwindling in Ohio due to deforestation, holds on in Tar Hollow's forest. The five-lined skink, distinguished by its brilliant blue tail, is found in the area along with the elusive fence lizard. Painted turtles can be seen along the shores of Pine Lake while the <b>lumbering</b> <b>box</b> turtle inhabits the dry land. Salamanders such as the red-backed, dusky, long-tailed and northern two-lined thrive on the cool, moist forest floor. In spring, the wooded hollows echo with the gobbling of wild turkey and the drumming of the ruffed grouse. Rare sightings of bobcat have been reported in this unique, wild region.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTwo {{sorts of}} lumber drying house {{covered by a}} {{composite}} surface consisting of three layer transparent films and a carbon-fibre sheet (CF-sheet; looks like a semi-opaque) were invented and developed. One of them was built in Ashoro-cho, {{the eastern part of}} Hokkaido, Japan (the first proving site), and the other was built in Asahikawa-shi, the central part of Hokkaido (the second proving site). The dimension of each drying houses is a frontage of 4. 5 m, depth of 5. 0 m and height of 3. 4 m (the 1 st site) and the same frontage and depth as the former, but height of 3. 8 m (the 2 nd site), respectively. Two types of models of the drying house (East-West type and South-North-type) were desinged. The former is shaped like a half Quonset hut and the latter a just Quonset hut. All of the surfaces including the roof and walls except for a north wall of both models are covered by a composite surface. The composite surface is specially consisted by a triple transparent film from upper side and a CF-sheet to bottom side between which there are a few space of air layers. As a result of mutual effect of a spectral radiation properties of the films and the CF-sheet, a total solar radiation incident upon the drying house with cubic body composed of multi-surface from all the sky globally, can be collected into the house as solar rays volumetrically, converted into infrared radiation and trapped inside the drying house as solar heat passively, without any electric power. Moreover, the moist air inside the house being evaporated when drying green lumber can be naturally exhausted through two insulated cylinders (chimney) outside the drying house according to a principle of the thermo-siphon. From these reasons, “An opaque solar lumber drying house covered by a composite surface consisting of a triple-transparent film and a CF-sheet” could be called “A fully passive solar lumber drying house” in other word. In this paper, after explained the principle of drying mechanism due to solar radiation and heat rays, the experimental procedures and the results at the proving test, on a board-larch lumber at the 1 st proving site and a <b>boxed</b> heart squares-larch <b>lumber</b> for pillar material at the 2 nd proving site, were described and discussed thoroughly...|$|R
