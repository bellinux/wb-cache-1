25|$|Sickle cell syndromes. A {{variety of}} sickle cell {{disorders}} result from inheritance of the sickle cell gene in a compound heterozygous manner with other mutant <b>beta</b> <b>globin</b> genes. These disorders include sickle cell-beta thalassemia. In {{the case of}} sickle cell anemia, an individual with one allele for hemoglobin S and one allele for hemoglobin C would still develop the disease, despite being heterozygous for both genes.|$|E
25|$|Thalassemias are genetic {{disorders}} {{inherited from}} a person's parents. There {{are two main}} types, alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia. The severity of alpha and beta thalassemia depends on {{how many of the}} four genes for alpha globin or two genes for <b>beta</b> <b>globin</b> are missing. Diagnosis is typically by blood tests including a complete blood count, special hemoglobin tests, and genetic tests. Diagnosis may occur before birth through prenatal testing.|$|E
25|$|There is {{more than}} one {{hemoglobin}} gene: in humans, hemoglobin A (the main form of hemoglobin present) is coded for by the genes, HBA1, HBA2, and HBB. The amino acid sequences of the globin proteins in hemoglobins usually differ between species. These differences grow with evolutionary distance between species. For example, the most common hemoglobin sequences in humans and chimpanzees are nearly identical, differing by only one amino acid in both the alpha and the <b>beta</b> <b>globin</b> protein chains. These differences grow larger between less closely related species.|$|E
40|$|Structural {{analysis}} of the hemoglobin (Hb) system of Delphinus delphis revealed a high globin multiplicity: HPLC-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis evidenced three major beta (beta 1 16, 022 Da, beta 2 16, 036 Da, beta 3 16, 036 Da, labeled according to their progressive elution times) and two major alpha globins (alpha 1 15, 345 Da, alpha 2 15, 329 Da). ESI-tandem mass and nucleotide sequence analyses showed that <b>beta</b> 2 <b>globin</b> differs from <b>beta</b> 1 for the substitution Val 126 -> Leu, while <b>beta</b> 3 <b>globin</b> differs from <b>beta</b> 2 for the isobaric substitution Lys 65 -> Gln. The alpha 2 globin differs from the alpha 1 for the substitution Ser 15 -> Ala. Anion-exchange chromatography allowed the separation of two Hb fractions and HPLC-ESI-MS analysis revealed that the fraction with higher pI (HbI) contained beta 1, beta 2 and both the alpha globins, and the fraction with lower pI (HbII) contained beta 3 and both the alpha globins. Both D. delphis Hb fractions displayed a lower intrinsic oxygen affinity, a decreased effect of 2, 3 -BPG and a reduced cooperativity with respect to human HbA(0), with HbII showing the more pronounced differences. With respect to HbA(0), either the substitution Pro beta 5 -> Gly or the Pro beta 5 -> Ala is present in all the cetacean <b>beta</b> <b>globins</b> sequenced so far, {{and it has been}} hypothesized that position 5 of <b>beta</b> <b>globins</b> may have a role in the interaction with 2, 3 -BPG. Regarding the particularly lowered cooperativity of HbII, it is interesting to observe that the variant human HbA, characterized by the substitution Lys beta 65 -> Gln (HbJ-Cairo) has a decreased cooperativity with respect to HbA(0) ...|$|R

We {{have studied the}} molecular mechanisms of transcriptional activation of the mouse <b>beta</b> maj <b>globin</b> gene during MEL cell differentiation by analyzing nuclear factor-DNA interactions in vivo at the gene's upstream promoter and a distal enhancer, 5 'HS- 2. Genomic footprinting data indicate that three motifs, CAC, NF-E 2 /AP 1, and GATA- 1, of the 5 'HS- 2 enhancer are bound with nuclear factors in MEL cells both prior to and after DMSO induction. No obvious conformational change of these nuclear factor-DNA complexes could be detected upon terminal differentiation of MEL cells. On the other hand, DMSO induction of MEL cells leads {{to the formation of}} specific nuclear factor-DNA complexes at several transcriptional regulatory elements of the mouse <b>beta</b> maj <b>globin</b> upstream promoter.

25|$|Recently, {{there had}} been {{discussion}} connecting copy number variations to gene families. Gene families are defined {{as a set of}} related genes that serve similar functions but have minor temporal or spatial differences and these genes likely derived from one ancestral gene. The main reason copy number variations are connected to gene families {{is that there is a}} possibility that genes in a family may have derived from one ancestral gene which got duplicated into different copies. Mutations accumulate through time in the genes and with natural selection acting on the genes, some mutations lead to environmental advantages allowing those genes to be inherited and eventually clear gene families are separated out. An example of a gene family that may have been created due to copy number variations is the globin gene family. The globin gene family is an elaborate network of genes consisting of alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>globin</b> genes including genes that are expressed in both embryos and adults as well as pseudogenes. These globin genes in the globin family are all well conserved and only differ by a small portion of the gene, indicating that they were derived from a common ancestral gene, perhaps due to duplication of the initial globin gene.|$|E

40|$|Haemoglobins are {{sensitive}} to temperature and their properties mirror the thermal conditions encountered by species during their evolutionary histories. This paper provides data on molecular phylogeny of the haemoglobin chains of Cottoperca gobio, a notothenioid fish of sub-Antarctic latitudes, belonging to the basal family Bovichtidae. Unlike most Antarctic notothenioids, C. gobio has two major haemoglobins sharing the beta chain. In the molecular phylogenetic analysis, the beta chain {{is included in the}} clade of the "embryonic" or minor Antarctic globins. Although, in the majority of notothenioids, "embryonic" (minor) alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>globins</b> are expressed in traces or small amounts in the adult stage, in C. gobio the present analysis supports the occurrence of a complete "switch" to exclusive expression of the embryonic beta-globin gene in adult fish.

40|$|We {{show that}} adult reticulocytes of Xenopus laevis produce {{two forms of}} the <b>beta</b> 1 <b>globin</b> mRNA that differ in their site of {{polyadenylation}}. The minor site of polyadenylation is located 46 nucleotides downstream of the major site and is used in approximately 1 % of mRNA molecules. A fusion gene was constructed containing the promoter from the thymidine kinase gene of herpes simplex virus fused to the protein coding, 3 '-noncoding and 3 '-flanking sequences of the X. laevis <b>beta</b> 1 <b>globin</b> gene. When injected into the nuclei of Xenopus oocytes, transcripts of this fusion gene were accurately and efficiently spliced and polyadenylated. The proportion of fusion gene transcripts terminating at the major and minor polyadenylation sites after injection into oocytes was approximately similar to that found in reticulocytes. When the AATAAA sequence element upstream from the major site was deleted, the minor site was used with a high (greater than 90 %) efficiency. Therefore, by comparing the ratio of polyadenylation at the major and minor sites, {{it is possible to}} determine the effect of sequence alterations at the major site. In a construct where the AATAAA polyadenylation signal was changed to AATACA a high proportion (35 %) of transcripts continued to be polyadenylated at the major site. This suggests a surprisingly high degree of flexibility in the precise polyadenylation signal...|$|R
40|$|Recombinant human {{hemoglobin}} rHb 1. 1 {{has been}} genetically engineered with {{the replacement of}} the wild-type valine residues at all N-termini with methionine, an Asn 108 Lys substitution on the <b>beta</b> <b>globins,</b> and a fusion of the two alpha globins with a glycine linker. When rHb 1. 1 was expressed in Escherichia coli, methylation of the N-terminal methionine of the alpha globin was discovered. Another mutant has been engineered with the alpha globin gene coding for N-terminal methionine followed by an insertion of alanine. Characterization of expressed hemoglobin from this variant revealed a methylated N-terminal alanine that occurred through two posttranslational events: initial excision of the N-terminal methionine, followed by methylation of alanine as the newly generated N-terminus. No methylation was observed for variants expressed with wild-type valine at the N-terminus of the alpha globin. The methylation of N-terminal amino acids was attributed to a specific protein sequence that can trigger methylation of proteins expressed in E. coli. Here we demonstrate that proline at position 4 in the protein sequence of alpha globin seems an essential part of that signaling. Although N-terminal methylation has been observed previously for native E. coli proteins with similar N-terminal sequences, methylation of the recombinant globins has allowed further delineation of the recognition sequence, and indicates that methylation of heterologous proteins can occur in E. coli...|$|R

Alpha thalassemia patients have partial or complete defects in alpha globin production, leading to a relative abundance of <b>beta</b> <b>globin</b> chains in the cell. These excess <b>beta</b> <b>globin</b> chains aggregate to form HbH, which has decreased solubility and precipitates in the red blood cell cytoplasm.

In addition, opposite strand transcripts from the GSHPx gene were found in increasing amounts during later stages of erythropoiesis. The initiation sites for specific subsets of these minor transcripts lie close to sequences known {{to be involved in}} globin gene regulation (i. e. the TATA, CAAT and the CACCCT boxes) or other conserved sequences; others lie close to developmentally regulated DNase I hypersensitive sites around the globin and GSHPx genes...|$|R
