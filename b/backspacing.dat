In computing, there has been ambiguity between the <b>backspace</b> key and delete key.

50|$|Pressing the <b>backspace</b> key on a {{computer}} terminal would generate the ASCII code 08, BS or <b>Backspace,</b> a control code which would delete the preceding character. That control code could also be accessed by pressing Control-H, as H is the eighth letter of the Latin alphabet. Terminals which {{did not have the}} <b>backspace</b> code mapped to the function of moving the cursor backwards and deleting the preceding character would display the symbols ^H (caret, H) when the <b>backspace</b> key was pressed. Even if a terminal did interpret <b>backspace</b> by deleting the preceding character, the system receiving the text might not. Then, the sender's screen would show a message without the supposedly deleted text, while that text, and the deletion codes, would be visible to the recipient. This sequence is still used humorously for epanorthosis by computer literates, denoting the deletion of a pretended blunder, much like a strikethrough; in this case, however, the ^H symbol is faked by typing a regular '^' key followed by typing a regular 'H' key.|$|R

The camera follows West's fleeing steps through the floor, incessantly <b>backspacing</b> on Norwood, who runs after him. The scene shifts into the living-room, where it changes into a sequence with two male dancers, before Norwood leaves the room to take stairs into the bedroom. West follows and sings to her next on the bed, when once again pop strangers in the room and Norwood and Kanye decide to escape out of the house. The video ends with both singers sitting in an oldtimer and driving down the street.|$|E
50|$|Alphabetical, numeric, and {{punctuation}} {{keys are}} used in the same fashion as a typewriter keyboard to enter their respective symbol into a word processing program, text editor, data spreadsheet, or other program. Many of these keys will produce different symbols when modifier keys or shift keys are pressed. The alphabetic characters become uppercase when the shift key or Caps Lock key is depressed. The numeric characters become symbols or punctuation marks when the shift key is depressed.

Use of the packing routine permits various routines for matrix handling to perform a direct reference to the input/output buffer if data addresses have once been received. The packing routine offers a buffer by buffer backspace feature for efficient <b>backspacing</b> in sequential access. Unlike a conventional <b>backspacing</b> that needs twice back record for a single read of one record (one column), this feature omits overlapping of READ operation and back record.

40|$|The {{complex interplay}} between gaze tracker {{accuracy}} and interface design {{is the focus}} of this paper. Two slightly different variants of GazeTalk, a hierarchical typing interface, were contrasted with a novel interface, Dasher, in which text entry is done by continuous navigation. All of the interfaces were tested with a good and a deliberate bad calibration of the tracker. The purpose was to investigate, if performance indices normally used for evaluation of typing systems, such as characters per minute (CPM) and error-rate, could differentiate between the conditions, and thus guide an iterative system development of both trackers and interfaces. Gaze typing with one version of the static, hierarchical menu systems was slightly faster than the others. Error measures, in terms of rate of <b>backspacing,</b> were also significantly different for the systems, while the deliberate bad tracker calibrations did not have any measurable effect. Learning effects were evident under all conditions. Power-law-of-practice learning models suggested that Dasher might be more efficient than GazeTalk in the long run...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to reveal and discuss the methodological issues related to online {{qualitative}} consumer behavior research. A number of methodological issues are examined, related with the online qualitative research on consumer in-store emotional experience implemented by the authors. It is concluded that the Internet is becoming an increasingly attractive environment for consumer behavior research. A large part of scholars use the Internet as a medium for data collection and analysis. At the same time, researchers study the Internet as a source of information about consumer preferences, their virtual communities, prevailing relationships, traditions and attitudes. The Internet is analyzed as a phenomenon in itself, too. In this article, the Internet is analyzed as a tool for communicating with research participants, and collecting, storing and analyzing data. In general, qualitative inquiry is characterized by contextual and naturalistic approach to the study of objects and processes. Therefore, decision to carry out qualitative study in virtual environment must take additional strategic and tactical solutions. Most often, researchers need to decide about the mode of communication that solves time management, spontaneity and security problems. It is also relevant to sampling and its contents. Different solutions from quantitative studies are required in ensuring the ethics and quality of the study. During the analysis of the qualitative data collected through the Internet, mostly in a form of computer communication language (text), specific characteristics, such as <b>backspacing</b> and correction during the communication that impact spontaneity rate, the absence of non-verbal language, etc., are necessary to be taken into account It is concluded that all the above-mentioned issues must be addressed individually to the research topic, object, aim, research problem and the specifics of the respondents. When deciding about the method of communication, it is important to assess which synchronous or asynchronous communication method is appropriate for the study participants. This decision relates to both computer literacy and psychological and personal factors of the researcher and a person involved. Asynchronous communication eliminates “rush” factor and solves organizational problems. Decision about communication synchronicity is closely associated with the interaction anonymity level. When the research question covers sensitive topics, on which the respondents may find it difficult to talk, it is recommended to choose the anonymous environment that encourages communication to be more open and free. In this case, it is likely preferable to use an asynchronous communication mode. On the basis of the analysis, it is concluded that qualitative research online population perception and evaluation differ from the reality research. The differences here relate to geographical uncertainty, cyberspace users’ sex, age, social status and other demographic characteristics intangibility. One way to solve the problem mentioned, especially in cases, where the investigation is carried out in the wider population, is to avoid studying as the unit of analysis individuals, and to choose unit of analysis as social interactions (e. g. unsuccessful purchases, in-store conflict, etc.), social artifacts (e. g. advertising) and so on. Ethical concerns analysis showed that although the online investigator is less constrained by the structure, space and time of communication, virtual environment complicates some ethical solutions (e. g. receiving informed consent). It is concluded that in cases, where the object of investigation or research field is not associated with sensitive aspects of personal life, there is no threat or harmful consequences for research participants and analyzes the generic nature of the problem, the study participants’ voluntary participation is seen as an implied consent. The study participant’s consent is difficult to obtain and can be excluded when data is collected anonymously. By using pseudonyms and responsibly citing the study participants’ computer communication language (text), confidentiality can be achieved. The authors indicate some limitations of the article. They examined the issues identified only in the context of a particular research and more samples were not discussed. This prevents access to general conclusions and contributes only in small aspects of the field. On the other side, each attempt to analyze Internet specificity caused issues lead to methodological qualitative online research perspicuity, research validity and reliability improvement...|$|E
