50|$|The {{number of}} {{different}} theoretical perspectives {{in the field of}} psychological abnormality has made it difficult to properly explain psychopathology. The attempt to explain all mental disorders with the same theory leads to reductionism (explaining a disorder or other complex phenomena using only a single idea or perspective). Most mental disorders are composed of several factors, which is why one must take into account several theoretical perspectives when attempting to diagnose or explain a particular <b>behavioral</b> <b>abnormality</b> or mental disorder. Explaining mental disorders with a combination of theoretical perspectives is known as multiple causality.|$|E
40|$|Dietary zinc {{deficiency}} increases glucocorticoid secretion from {{the adrenal cortex}} via enhanced hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis activity and induces neuropsychological symptoms, i. e., <b>behavioral</b> <b>abnormality.</b> <b>Behavioral</b> <b>abnormality</b> {{is due to the}} increase in glucocorticoid secretion rather than disturbance of brain zinc homeostasis, which occurs after the increase in glucocorticoid secretion. A major target of glucocorticoids is the hippocampus and their actions are often associated with disturbance of glutamatergic neurotransmission, which may be linked to <b>behavioral</b> <b>abnormality,</b> such as depressive symptoms and aggressive behavior under {{zinc deficiency}}. Glucocorticoid-mediated disturbance of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus is also involved in the pathophysiology of, not only psychiatric disorders, such as depression, but also neurodegenerative disorders, e. g., Alzheimer’s disease. The evidence suggests that zinc-deficient animals are models for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), as well as depression. To understand validity to apply zinc-deficient animals as a <b>behavioral</b> <b>abnormality</b> model, this paper deals with the effect of antidepressive drugs and herbal medicines on hippocampal dysfunctions and <b>behavioral</b> <b>abnormality,</b> which are induced by enhanced HPA axis activity under dietary zinc deficiency...|$|E

However, the specific genes within 22 q 11. 2 that contribute to these disorders are still poorly understood. Here, we show that an ≈ 200 -kb segment of human 22 q 11. 2 causes specific <b>behavioral</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in mice. Mice that overexpress an ≈ 200 -kb region of human 22 q 11. 2, containing CDCrel, GP 1 Bβ, TBX 1, and WDR 14, exhibited spontaneous sensitization of hyperactivity {{and a lack of}} habituation.

40|$|In {{patients}} with Alzheimer's disease, {{in addition to}} the core symptoms, i. e., cognitive dysfunction, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, anxiety, and hallucinations are known to occur frequently. Because various environmental factors influence the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease, in the present study, BPSD-like <b>behavioral</b> <b>abnormality</b> of Amyloid β (Aβ) 1 - 42 -injected mice was assessed under social isolation, which induces <b>behavioral</b> <b>abnormality.</b> Aβ protein (500 pmol) was injected into the lateral ventricle of mice, which were individually housed. Two and three weeks after injection into adult mice, the rate of mice that exhibited aggressive behavior, i. e., biting attacks and wrestling, to the total mice, was markedly increased by Aβ injection. Aβ-injected adult mice also showed anxiety-like behavior, in addition to cognitive decline. Serum corticosterone level was markedly increased by Aβ injection. When excitability of hippocampal neurons was checked using hippocampal slices, KCl-induced presynaptic activity was enhanced in hippocampal slices prepared from Aβ-injected mice. These results suggest that social isolation housing of Aβ 1 - 42 -injected adult mice induces BPSD-like <b>behavioral</b> <b>abnormality</b> in addition to cognitive decline. It is likely that <b>behavioral</b> <b>abnormality</b> of Aβ 1 - 42 -injected adult mice is associated with excitability of hippocampal glutamatergic neurons, which is associated with the elevated corticosterone level.

40|$|Drug {{addiction}} is a compulsive <b>behavioral</b> <b>abnormality.</b> In spite of pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments {{to reduce or}} eliminate drug taking, addiction tends to persist over time. Preclinical and human observations have converged on the hypothesis that addiction represents the pathologic deterioration of neural processes that normally serve affective and cognitive functioning. The major elements of persistent compulsive drug use are hypothesized to be molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie enduring changes {{in a number of}} forebrain circuits (involving the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex) that receive input from midbrain dopamine neurons and are involved in affective and cognitive mechanisms, respectively. Here we review progress in identifying crucial elements useful in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease and its pharmacologic treatment. Pharmacologic targeting of K-opiate receptors, with their discrete distribution within the dopaminergic system(s), and thus different actions on dopaminoceptive areas, may provide beneficial effects at the affective and cognitive level. ...|$|E

40|$|Phosphoinositide 3 -kinase {{enhancer}} (PIKE) binds {{and enhances}} phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt activities. However, its physiological functions in brain {{have never been}} explored. Here we show that PIKE is important in regulating the neuronal survival and development of neocortex. During development, enhanced apoptosis is observed in the ventricular zone of PIKE knock-out (PIKE-/-) cortex. Moreover, PIKE-/-neurons show reduced dendritic complexity, dendritic branch length, and soma size. These defects are due to the reduced PI 3 K/Akt activities in PIKE-/- neurons, as the impaired dendritic arborization can be rescued when PI 3 K/Akt cascade is augmented in vitro or in PIKE-/-PTEN-/- double-knock-out mice. Interestingly, PIKE-/- mice display <b>behavioral</b> <b>abnormality</b> in locomotion and spatial navigation. Because of the diminished PI 3 K/Akt activities, PIKE-/- neurons are more vulnerable to glutamateor stroke-induced neuronal cell death. Together, our data established the critical role of PIKE in regulating neuronal survival and development by substantiating the PI 3 K/Akt pathway. © 2011 the authors.

40|$|AbstractIncreased {{homocysteine}} (Hcy) {{level has}} been implicated {{as an independent}} risk factor for various neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Hcy {{has been reported to}} cause dopaminergic neuronal loss in rodents and causes the <b>behavioral</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> This study is an attempt to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying Hcy-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity after its chronic systemic administration. Male Swiss albino mice were injected with different doses of Hcy (100 and 250 mg/kg; intraperitoneal) for 60 days. Animals subjected to higher doses of Hcy, but not the lower dose, produces motor <b>behavioral</b> <b>abnormalities</b> with significant dopamine depletion in the striatum. Significant inhibition of mitochondrial complex-I activity in nigra with enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes in the nigrostriatum have highlighted the involvement of Hcy-induced oxidative stress. While, chronic exposure to Hcy neither significantly alters the nigrostriatal glutathione level nor it causes any visible change in tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactivity of dopaminergic neurons. The finding set us to hypothesize that the mild oxidative stress due to prolonged Hcy exposure to mice is conducive to striatal dopamine depletion leading to <b>behavioral</b> <b>abnormalities</b> similar to that observed in PD...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{association}} of histone modification changes with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) {{has not been}} systematically examined. We conducted a histone acetylome-wide association study (HAWAS) by performing H 3 K 27 ac chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) on 257 postmortem samples from ASD and matched control brains. Despite etiological heterogeneity, ≥ 68 % of syndromic and idiopathic ASD cases shared a common acetylome signature at > 5, 000 cis-regulatory elements in prefrontal and temporal cortex. Similarly, multiple genes associated with rare genetic mutations in ASD showed common “epimutations. ” Acetylome aberrations in ASD were not attributable to genetic differentiation at cis-SNPs and highlighted genes involved in synaptic transmission, ion transport, epilepsy, <b>behavioral</b> <b>abnormality,</b> chemokinesis, histone deacetylation, and immunity. By correlating histone acetylation with genotype, we discovered > 2, 000 histone acetylation quantitative trait loci (haQTLs) in human brain regions, including four candidate causal variants for psychiatric diseases. Due to the relative stability of histone modifications postmortem, we anticipate that the HAWAS approach will be applicable to multiple diseases...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} lethal {{mutations}} {{in the single}} calmodulin gene (Cam) of Drosophila to gain insight into the in vivo functions of this important calcium sensor. As a result of maternal calmodulin (CaM) in the mature egg, lethality is delayed until the postembryonic stages.

We show here that the null behavioral phenotype originates in the nervous system and involves a CaM function that requires calcium binding to all four sites of the protein. Further, backward movement can be induced in hypomorphic mutants by exposure to high light levels. In contrast, the V 91 G mutation specifically affects the musculature and causes abnormal calcium release in response to depolarization of the muscles. Genetic interaction studies suggest that failed regulation of the muscle calcium release channel, the ryanodine receptor, is the major defect underlying the Cam 7 phenotype...|$|E
