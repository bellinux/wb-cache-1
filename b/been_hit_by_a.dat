5|$|He had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{marksman}} {{from the}} Redoutable, firing {{at a range}} of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on {{the handling of the}} tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E
5|$|The {{engagement}} {{had lasted}} just ten minutes according to Shannons log, or eleven minutes by Lieutenant Wallis' watch. Broke more modestly claimed fifteen minutes in his official despatch. Shannon had lost 23 men killed, and had 56 wounded. Chesapeake had about 48 killed, including four lieutenants, the master {{and many other}} of her officers, and 99 wounded. Shannon had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> total of 158 projectiles, Chesapeake by 362 (these figures include grapeshot). In the time the batteries of both ships were firing, the Americans {{had been exposed to}} 44 roundshot, whilst the British had received 10 or 11 in reply (these are figures for shot which would have produced casualties or material damage; some of Chesapeakes shot was fired low, bouncing off Shannons side at waterline level). Even before being boarded, Chesapeake had lost the gunnery duel by a considerable margin.|$|E
5|$|Stengel, hired {{only days}} before spring training, had but a limited {{opportunity}} to shape his new ballclub. The Dodgers quickly settled into sixth place, {{where they would}} end the season. Stengel, in later years, enjoyed discussing one 1934 game in Philadelphia's Baker Bowl: with Dodger pitcher Boom-Boom Beck ineffective, Stengel {{went out to the}} mound to take out the angry pitcher, who, instead of giving Stengel the baseball, threw it into right field, where it hit the metal wall with a loud noise. The right fielder, Hack Wilson, lost in thought, heard the boom, assumed the ball had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> batter, and ran to retrieve it and throw it to the infield, to be met by general laughter. Stengel got the last laughs on the Giants as well. The Giants, six games ahead of the Cardinals on Labor Day, dissipated that lead, and with two games in the season were tied with St. Louis—with the final two games against Brooklyn at the Polo Grounds, games played in front of raucous crowds, who well remembered Terry's comments. Brooklyn won both games, while the Cardinals won their two games against the Cincinnati Reds, and won the pennant. Richard Bak, in his biography of Stengel, noted that the victories over the Terry-led Giants represented personal vindication for the Dodger manager.|$|E

50|$|Further {{showing his}} {{toughness}} as a ballplayer, Elberfeld {{was not afraid}} of being <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> pitch. He led the American League in being <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> pitch in 1903 and 1911 and was among the league leaders in the category nine times. In 1911, he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> pitch 25 times, setting an American League record that was not broken until 1986 when Don Baylor <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> pitch 35 times.

The stone reportedly fell through banana leaves before striking the boy on the head, causing little to no pain, as it was small enough to have been slowed by both friction with the atmosphere {{as well as that}} with banana leaves, before striking the boy.|$|E

25|$|The {{country had}} <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{prolonged}} period of dry {{weather in the}} second half 2011, which had been attributed to the La Niña that results in the cooling of the surface temperature of the sea around Tuvalu which resulted in reduced rainfall. In October 2011, the Tuvalu Red Cross reported that the country had not received normal rainfall in six months, leading to shortages. The capital, Funafuti, and several of the outer atolls had been particularly affected by the drought. Nukulaelae and Nanumaga were the most seriously affected outer islands. The dry conditions on Nukulaelae affected the vast majority of pulaka pits - Pulaka, or swamp taro, is a staple crop for Tuvaluans. On Vaitupu the drought was also severe, but not as bad as the other islands.|$|E

25|$|A Rwandan {{colonel who}} called the army command about 40 minutes after the crash was told {{that there was no}} {{confirmation}} that the president was dead. About half an hour later, roughly 9:30, the situation was still confused at army command, though it appeared clear that the presidential aircraft had exploded and that it had probably <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> missile. News arrived that Major-General Déogratias Nsabimana, the army chief of staff, had been on the plane. The officers present realized {{that they would have to}} appoint a new chief of staff in order to clarify the chain of command and began a meeting to decide whom to appoint. Col. Bagosora joined them soon afterward. At about 10 pm, Ephrem Rwabalinda, the government liaison officer to UNAMIR, called Dallaire to inform him that a crisis committee was about to meet. After informing his superiors in New York City of the situation, Dallaire went to attend the meeting, where he found Bagosora in charge.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 2003-2004, Gelayev led a raid from Georgia into the mountainous Tsuntinsky District region of the Russian {{republic}} of Dagestan, during which 20-30 of his fighters (Chechen and Dagestani, possibly including Khozh-Ahmed Noukhayev) and 15 Russian servicemen {{were reported to have}} died in the fighting and landslide accidents, while five rebels were captured. According to the official story, Gelayev died on February 28, 2004, following a skirmish with a two-man patrol of the Border Guard Service of Russia that he had encountered while attempting to cross the border into Georgia alone. Gelayev shot and killed both guards (Dagestani citizens First Sergeant Mukhtar Suleimanov and Sergeant Abdulkhalik Kurbanov, who both were posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation), but he himself then died soon after {{as a result of a}} serious injury he suffered during the shootout, having <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> rifle burst in his left arm. After walking about 100 meters, Gelayev cut off his own mangled hand, but died from blood loss.|$|E
25|$|Gorshin {{was born}} on April 5, 1933, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Catholic parents Frances, a seamstress, and Frank Gorshin, Sr., a {{railroad}} worker. He was of Slovenian ancestry. His father, Frank Sr., was a second-generation Slovenian-American whose parents emigrated to America from Slovenia. His mother, Frances or Fanny, née Prešeren, came to the United States {{as a young girl}} from Regrča Vas, near Novo Mesto, the main city of Lower Carniola, in Slovenia. Both of his parents were active in Pittsburgh's Slovenian community. They sang in the Slovenian Singing Society Prešeren, named after the great Slovenian poet France Prešeren. In an interview, Frances said that her son, being the product of a Slovenian home, spoke mostly Slovene before going to school. At the age of 15, he took a part-time job as a cinema usher at the Sheridan Square Theatre. He memorized the mannerisms of the screen stars he saw and created an impressionist act. He was still in high school when he obtained his first paid employment, which he secured as the prize in a Pittsburgh talent contest in 1951: a one-week engagement at Jackie Heller's New York nightclub, Carousel. His parents insisted that he take the engagement, even though his 15-year-old brother had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> car and killed just two nights before.|$|E

25|$|During {{the evening}} of 16–17 June, the three destroyers were ordered to {{undertake}} surveillance missions around Tiger Island, because of reports of North Vietnamese helicopter activity in the area. At 03:09, Hobarts radar picked up an aircraft approaching with no IFF transponder active. At 03:14, the aircraft fired a single missile at the ship, which killed one sailor, wounded two others, and damaged the chief petty officer's mess, air search radar and missile control compartments, and the ship's funnels. Two minutes later, the aircraft made a second pass and fired two missiles. The missiles hit simultaneously: one penetrated the superstructure and damaged the gunners' store, engineers workshop, and aft seamans' mess, while the other hit close to the original missile, causing further damage to the mess and missile control room, while also damaging the Tartar checkout room, killing another sailor, and wounded six others. These was also major damage around the destroyer's Ikara magazine, but as Hobart was not carrying any Ikara missiles at the time, the potential magazine fire did not occur. The aircraft came around for a third attack run, but was scared off when Hobarts forward gun turret, under independent control, fired five rounds at the aircraft. At 03:30, Edson reported coming under fire, and Hobart captain ordered the three destroyers to take up anti-aircraft formation. At 05:15, the three destroyers linked up with the cruiser USS Boston (which had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> missile from another aircraft) and the escorting destroyer , and continued anti-aircraft manoeuvring. After being relieved, Hobart sailed for Subic Bay, where the damage was inspected by RAN and USN personnel, including three admirals. Debris collected from Hobart and the other ships indicated that the missiles were of United States Air Force (USAF) origin.|$|E
