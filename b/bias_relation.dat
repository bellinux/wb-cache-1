As discussed by Mo & White (1996), this bias is nonlinear and stochastic. They developed a model which allows one to write down analytic expressions for {{the mean of the}} <b>bias</b> <b>relation,</b> in the initial Lagrangian, and the evolved, Eulerian spaces. We provide analytic expressions for the higher order moments as well.

Here, we retrace these calculations and show that, on scales approaching the horizon, the observed galaxy power spectrum depends strongly on which gauge is assumed to relate the intrinsic fluctuations in galaxy density to matter perturbations through a linear <b>bias</b> <b>relation.</b> Starting from simple physical assumptions, we derive a gauge-invariant expression relating galaxy density perturbations to matter density perturbations on large scales, and show that it reduces to a linear <b>bias</b> <b>relation</b> in a synchronous-comoving gauge, corroborating an assumption made in several recent papers. We evaluate the resulting observed galaxy power spectrum, and show that it leads to corrections similar to an effective non-Gaussian bias corresponding to a local f_(NL,eff) ≲ 0. 5. This number can serve as a guideline as to which surveys need to take into account relativistic effects.

We derive this filter as the maximum a posteriori solution assuming a lognormal prior {{distribution for the}} matter field with a given mean field and modeling the observed galaxy distribution by a Poissonian process. We have performed a three-dimensional implementation of this filter with a very efficient Newton-Krylov inversion scheme. Furthermore, we have tested it with a dark matter N-body simulation assuming a unit galaxy <b>bias</b> <b>relation</b> and compared the results with previous density field estimators like the inverse weighting scheme and Wiener filtering. Our results show good agreement with the underlying dark matter field for overdensities even above delta~ 1000 which exceeds by one order of magnitude the regime in which the lognormal {{is expected to be}} valid. The reason is that for our filter the lognormal assumption enters as a prior distribution function, but the maximum a posteriori solution is also conditioned on the data. We find that the lognormal filter is superior to the previous filtering schemes in terms of higher correlation coefficients and smaller Euclidean distances to the underlying matter field.

40|$|We {{present a}} public code to {{generate}} a mock galaxy catalog in redshift space assuming a log-normal probability density function (PDF) of galaxy and matter density fields. We draw galaxies by Poisson-sampling the log-normal field, and calculate the velocity field from the linearised continuity equation of matter fields, assuming zero vorticity. This procedure yields a PDF of the pairwise velocity fields that is qualitatively {{similar to that of}} N-body simulations. We check fidelity of the catalog, showing that the measured two-point correlation function and power spectrum in real space agree with the input precisely. We find that a linear <b>bias</b> <b>relation</b> in the power spectrum does not guarantee a linear <b>bias</b> <b>relation</b> in the density contrasts, leading to a cross-correlation coefficient of matter and galaxies deviating from unity on small scales. We also find that linearising the Jacobian of the real-to-redshift space mapping provides a poor model for the two-point statistics in redshift space. That is, non-linear redshift-space distortion is dominated by non-linearity in the Jacobian. The power spectrum in redshift space shows a damping on small scales that is qualitatively {{similar to that of the}} well-known Fingers-of-God (FoG) effect due to random velocities, except that the log-normal mock does not include random velocities. This damping is a consequence of non-linearity in the Jacobian, and thus attributing the damping of the power spectrum solely to FoG, as commonly done in the literature, is misleading.

Random and systematic errors are estimated from multiple realizations of mock catalogs drawn from a simulation that mimics the observed density field in the local universe.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a cross-correlation between the weak gravitational lensing {{field of the}} large-scale structure, κ, and the secondary temperature fluctuation field, Δ, of cosmic microwave background (CMB) induced by Thomson scattering of CMB photons off the ionized medium in the mildly nonlinear structure. The cross-correlation is expected to observationally unveil the <b>biasing</b> <b>relation</b> between the dark matter and ionized medium distributions in the large-scale structure. We develop a formalism for calculating the cross-correlation function and its angular power spectrum based on the small angle approximation. As a result, we find that leading contribution to the cross-correlation comes from the secondary CMB fluctuation field induced by the quadratic Doppler effects of the bulk velocity field v of ionized medium. The magnitude of the cross-correlation can be estimated as κΔ∼ 10 ^- 10 on small angular scales (l 1000) under the currently favored cold CDM model of the structure formation and the simplest scenario of homogeneous reionization after a given redshift of z_ ion 5. Interestingly, {{we find that the}} density-modulated quadratic Doppler effect of O(δ_e v^ 2) produces the cross-correlation with the weak lensing field that has linear dependence on the electron density fluctuation field δ_e or equivalently on the <b>biasing</b> <b>relation</b> between the dark matter and electron distributions. In other words, the angular power spectrum could be both positive or negative, depending on the positive biasing or antibiasing, respectively. Detection of the cross-correlation thus offers a new opportunity to observationally understand the reionization history of intergalactic medium connected to the dark matter clustering.

40|$|For Gaussian {{primordial}} fluctuations {{the relationship}} between galaxy and matter overdensities, bias, is most often assumed to be local {{at the time of}} observation in the large-scale limit. This hypothesis is however unstable under time evolution, we provide proofs under several (increasingly more realistic) sets of assumptions. In the simplest toy model galaxies are created locally and linearly biased at a single formation time, and subsequently move with the dark matter (no velocity bias) conserving their comoving number density (no merging). We show that, after this formation time, the bias becomes unavoidably nonlocal and nonlinear at large scales. We identify the nonlocal gravitationally induced fields in which the galaxy overdensity can be expanded, showing that they can be constructed out of the invariants of the deformation tensor (Galileons), the main signature of which is a quadrupole field in second-order perturbation theory. In addition, we show that this result persists if we include an arbitrary evolution of the comoving number density of tracers. We then include velocity bias, and show that new contributions appear; these are related to the breaking of Galilean invariance of the <b>bias</b> <b>relation,</b> a dipole field being the signature at second order. We test these predictions by studying the dependence of halo overdensities in cells of fixed dark matter density: measurements in simulations show that departures from the mean <b>bias</b> <b>relation</b> are strongly correlated with the nonlocal gravitationally induced fields identified by our formalism, suggesting that the halo distribution at the present time is indeed more closely related to the mass distribution at an earlier rather than present time. However, the nonlocality seen in the simulations is not fully captured by assuming local bias in Lagrangian space. The effects on nonlocal bias seen in the simulations are most important for the most biased halos, as expected from our predictions. Accounting for these effects when modeling galaxy bias is essential for correctly describing the dependence on triangle shape of the galaxy bispectrum, and hence constraining cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity. We show that using our formalism we remove an important systematic in the determination of bias parameters from the galaxy bispectrum, particularly for luminous galaxies...|$|E

The documentary The Diamond Queen was criticised for this: {{in a letter to}} the chairman of the BBC Trust, Chris Patten, Graham Smith, the organisation's Chief Executive, argued that the programme breached BBC guidelines on impartiality. In his letter, Smith claimed the series was subject to [...] "distortions, half-truths and fabrications".|$|R

In order to minimize non-linear effects {{and to deal with}} ill-sampled regions we smooth both fields using a Gaussian window with radii ranging between 12 − 20 h − 1 Mpc. The density and velocity fields within 70 h − 1 Mpc exhibit similarities, qualitatively consistent with gravitational instability theory and a linear <b>biasing</b> <b>relation</b> between clusters and mass. The random and systematic errors are evaluated with the help of mock catalogs. Quantitative comparisons within a volume containing ∼ 12 independent samples yield βc ≡ Ω 0. 6 /bc = 0. 22 ± 0. 08, where bc is the cluster biasing parameter at 15 h − 1 Mpc. If bc ∼ 4. 5, as indicated by the cluster correlation function, our result is consistent with Ω ∼ 1. Key words: Cosmology: theory – galaxies: clustering, large–scale structure, large–scale dynamics. ...|$|R
