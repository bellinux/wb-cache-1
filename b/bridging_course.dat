50|$|After Webb’s {{death on}} 28 November 1893, his wife, {{following}} her husbands’ instructions, employed as successor, John Smith-Hill, an associate {{member of the}} Surveyors Institute with a First Class Diploma from the R.A.S., and a B.Sc. Honours Degree in Botany from London University. Smith-Hill arrived at Aspatria in January 1894 to find a register of 65 scholars and a staff of ten lecturers. He began by expanding {{the scope of the}} curriculum such that within two years he had broadened its base and began to specialise in the training of managers required for the empire’s emerging estates and farms. He divided the course into three discrete sections. The first, a <b>bridging</b> <b>course,</b> designed to assist the less well educated student, to improve their knowledge in Algebra, English Composition, Book Keeping, Drawing, Arithmetic, Elementary Science and Agriculture. The second, more advanced, included Chemistry, Menstruation, Geology, Botany, Veterinary Medicine; Land Surveying and Agricultural Law. To fulfil the practicable requirements of the final section he added Practical Surveying, Beekeeping and Veterinary Surgery. He established an annual fact finding magazine entitled the College Chronicle. He employed a professional valuer, to teach the skills of property valuation. He also introduced a Mining class specifically designed for those students seeking their fortunes in foreign fields. Finally he changed the entry procedures. He discouraged girls, raised the entrance age to sixteen and introduced an entrance examination. He also increased the fees to a commercial level. By 1900, the minimum annual charges levied on students under the age of 20, was £100. Students above this age paid a surcharge of £10. In December 1896, a commendatory report appeared in the North British Agriculturist, stating that Aspatria College had more students than the combined intake of all those attending agricultural classes in Scotland & Northern England. On 4 August 1896, Smith-Hill married Webbs’ widow and became the joint owner of the College. In 1898 he established the Old Aspatrian Club, with over 60 members, which met annually in the Holborn restaurant, London and later in Carlisle. In 1902, in association with the London Meteorological office, the college established a meteorological station at Aspatria; its aim, to provide a daily district account of a variety of changing climatic conditions. After 1903 students began to specialise in the requirements of the Land Agency and students tended to concentrate on the professional Association Examination of the Surveyors Institution. In the opening two years the college experienced a 100% success rate in each corresponding examination and took the Beadel Prize for best student on both occasions. In 1904 Smith-Hill received a Gold Medal from the Surveyors Institute for a paper entitled Agricultural in Cumberland, reviewing the changes between 1850 and 1900. In 1904 when summarising the career prospects of a number of his past students; he reported that 61 continued to farm in the United Kingdom and of the remainder, 46 were pursuing work in the colonies and the Argentine; 25 were pursuing the Land agency profession; and 9 were following other occupations. He made special reference to John Goodwin, the current Director of a Demonstration Farm at Kalimpong India; and Lawrence Carpenter, the Chief of the Agricultural Office in Nairobi, East Africa. By 1909, in addition to attracting students from the British Empire, scholars were enrolling from Portugal, India, West Indies, South Africa the Middle East and Egypt. In 1914, the final year, the official returns from the Surveyors Institute indicated that of the candidates examined in that year's intake the ratio of success was 60%. However, in the case of Aspatria this figure was 100%.|$|E
40|$|M. Ed. (Tertiary and Adult Education) The {{technical}} teacher often {{enters the}} teaching profession via industry. He/she comes to realise that, because he/she is professionally unqualified, the posibilities {{for the development of}} his/her career are extremely limited. since 1986 the College of Education of South Africa has made provision for these teachers by offering a course that enables them to gain admission to a Higher Diploma in Education. The study showed that the adult learner differs from the typical <b>bridging</b> <b>course</b> student. Among other things, the CESA <b>bridging</b> <b>course</b> student differs in respect of age and finality of vocational choice, and generally has no particular academic needs requiring academic support. The technical teacher as a <b>bridging</b> <b>course</b> student receives no academic support; neither is he/she offered any course to compensate for underachievement or educational deprivation. The connotation in the term <b>bridging</b> <b>course</b> leads to comparisons with traditional bridging courses, and a change of name for the existing course would be advisable. The <b>bridging</b> <b>course</b> covers the acquisition of additional techical qualifications, thus complying with the reguirements for admission to a Higher Diploma in Education (Technical).
