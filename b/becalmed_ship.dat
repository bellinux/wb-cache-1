5000|$|If {{interpreting}} {{the movement in}} light of [...] "veils," [...] the eerie, mysterious mood of the A section sounds veiled. The clearer, more open sound of the B section generates an impression that the veil is removed, but returns for the A' section. If one takes [...] "sails" [...] as a possible understanding of the title, {{that leads to a}} possible image of a <b>becalmed</b> <b>ship</b> in the A and A' sections, with the clearer, louder, brighter B section denoting a more open sea and sails full of wind. Generally however, there is no clear structure that the piece fits easily into; neither ternary form nor binary form fit in with the style of the piece. Some say that the pentatonic section forms the B part but, in truth, it is not clear enough to state it is definitely ABA. Others argue that it follows a Rounded Binary form more than Ternary form {{due to the fact that}} there is an A part, B part and then another bit at the end, concluding all of his ideas.|$|E

The paintings include many dramatic effects such as battles at night, the shooting of cannons and the effect of bombardments. There are, however, also less militant themes such as <b>ships</b> <b>becalmed.</b> His [...] "sublime depiction of the sky" [...] was considered especially noteworthy.

By 13:30 he had forced the Lexington to surrender; she had suffered seven killed and 11 wounded to the Alert's two dead and three wounded. A prize crew then sailed Lexington to Britain.

50|$|The pirate ships {{used by the}} Moros {{were known}} as proa, or garays, and they varied in design. The {{majority}} were wooden sailing galleys about ninety feet long with a beam of ten feet 90 by 20 ft. They carried around fifty to 100 crewmen. Moros usually armed their vessels with three swivel guns, called lelahs or lantakas, and occasionally a heavy cannon, proas were very fast and the pirates would prey on merchant <b>ships</b> <b>becalmed</b> in shallow water as they passed through the Sulu Sea. Slave trading and raiding was also very common, the pirates would assemble large fleets of proas and attack coastal towns. Hundreds of Christians were captured and imprisoned over the centuries, many were used as galley slaves aboard the pirate ships.|$|R
50|$|Víkar (Old Norse {{nominative}} case form Víkarr; Latin Wicarus) was {{a legendary}} Norwegian king who found {{himself and his}} <b>ships</b> <b>becalmed</b> for a long period. To raise a wind, a human blood sacrifice was needed, and the lots fell on King Víkar himself. Starkad (Starkaðr), Víkar's counselor urged a mock hanging from a tree instead, but in giving this advice Starkad had been prompted by the god Odin, who desired Víkar's death. According to the account in Gautreks saga, when Starkad let loose the branch, the apparent reed-stalk with which Starkad stabbed at the king was seen {{to be a real}} spear, the stump under Víkar's feet fell away, and the calf guts which had been used instead of rope turned into a strong withy. Víkar died. Saxo Grammaticus in Gesta Danorum (book 6) refers to a similar version relating a magic transformation, but prefers or invents a more rational account in which Starkad tied the osier very tightly so that Víkar could hardly breathe and then stabbed Víkar with his sword. This was the first of Starkad's three great crimes.|$|R
5000|$|Murray {{was then}} {{appointed}} to the command of the frigate , and patrolled in the West Indies until early 1802, when he was appointed the commodore of a small squadron sent to blockade Tripoli. In Constellation, he relieved Commodore Richard Dale (with whom he has served aboard the Trumbull). Murray distributed his small force, {{so as not to}} allow a single Tripolitan ship to escape to prey upon American merchantmen. At one time he was entirely alone and <b>becalmed</b> in his <b>ship</b> off the bay of Tripoli. The Algerians sent out a force of small armed vessels propelled by sweeps to attack him. Eventually a favourable breeze sprang up, and Murray was able to counter-attack with such effect, that the Tripolitan vessels fled back to the safety of the harbour under the protection of shore batteries. [...] Unfortunately, after only four months Murray was superseded by Captain Richard V. Morris, and ordered to return to the United States. He complained about his treatment to the naval authorities without effect, and remained unemployed for the next few years.|$|R
25|$|After {{the victory}} at the Saintes, and {{during a period of}} calm weather, Rodney {{detached}} a squadron under his second in command, Sir Samuel Hood, to pursue some of the crippled French ships. Valiant was one of the ships detached with Hood, and on 19 April the squadron caught two ships of the line and three frigates {{at the entrance to the}} Mona Passage. The French force, consisting of the 64-gun ships Caton and Jason, and the frigates Astree, Aimable and Ceres attempted to escape, Hood signalling for them to be engaged before they could run themselves ashore. In the ensuing Battle of the Mona Passage, Valiant found herself the headmost ship, and with most of the other British <b>ships</b> <b>becalmed</b> or chasing other ships, Goodall pressed on sail to catch the Caton, and managed to rake her bows, on which she immediately struck. Goodall did not stop to take possession, but instead pressed on after the fleeing Jason, opening fire on her and fighting a fierce engagement for 45 minutes until the French ship surrendered. Valiant had 12 men killed and wounded in the action.|$|R
60|$|The Dawn was {{overtaken}} by the seas, {{from time to}} time; and, then, like everything else that floats, she yawed, or rather, had her stern urged impetuously round, {{as if it were}} {{in a hurry to get}} ahead of the bows. On these occasions, the noise made by the fore-top-mast stay-sail, as it collapsed and filled, resembled the report of a small gun. We had similar reports from the fore-sail, which, for moments at a time, was actually <b>becalmed,</b> as the <b>ship</b> settled into the trough; and then became distended with a noise like that of the shaking of a thousand carpets, all filled with Sancho Panzas, at the same instant. As yet, the cloth and gear had stood these violent shocks admirably; but, just as Talcott was leading his party down, the ship made one of her side-long movements; the stay-sail filled with a tremendous report, and away it flew to leeward, taken out--of the bolt-rope as if it had been cut by shears, and then used by the furies of the tempest. Talcott smiled, as he gazed at the driving canvass, which went a quarter of a mile before it struck the water, whirling like a kite that has broken its string, and then he shook his head. I disliked, too, the tremendous surges of the fore-sail, when it occasionally collapsed and as suddenly filled, menacing to start every bolt, and to part every rope connected with block or spar.|$|R

I was too full of unfinished speculations and premature convictions to value rightly his conversation, informed by a vast erudition, which would give itself to every casual association of speech and company, precisely because he had neither cause nor design. My father, however, found Powell's concrete narrative manner in talk a necessary completion of his own, and when I asked him in a letter many years later where he got his philosophy replied [...] "from York Powell" [...] and thereon added, no doubt remembering that Powell was without ideas, [...] "by looking at him."

60|$|And he told me, {{whether in}} time or space I know not, {{of a country}} whose people were of my stature and slenderness. This was a land, he said, walled in by enormous, ice-capped {{mountains}} couching the furnace of the rising sun, and yet set at the ocean's edge. Its sand-dunes ring like dulcimers in the heat. Its valleys of swift rivers were of a green so pale and vivid and so flower-encrusted that an English--even a Kentish--spring is but a coarse and rustic prettiness by comparison. Vine and orange and trees of outlandish names gave their fruits there; yet there also willows swept the winds, and palms spiked the blue with their fans, and the cactus flourished with the tamarisk. Geese, of dark green and snow, were on its inland waters, and a bird clocked the hours of the night, and the conformation of its stars would be strange to my eyes. And such was the lowliness and simplicity of this people's habitations that the most powerful sea-glass, turned upon and searching their secret haunts from a <b>ship</b> <b>becalmed</b> on the ocean, would spy out nothing--nothing there, only world wilderness of snow-dazzling mountain-top and green valley, ravine, and condor, and what might just be Nature's small ingenuities--mounds and traceries. Yet within all was quiet loveliness, feet light as goldfinches', silks fine as gossamer, voices as of a watery beading of silence. And their life being all happiness they have no name for their God. And it seems--according to Mr Anon's account of it--that such was the ancient history of the world, that Man was so once, but had swollen to his present shape, {{of which he had}} lost the true spring and mastery, and had sunk deeper and deeper into a kind of oblivion of the mind, suffocating his past, and now all but insane with pride in his own monstrosities.|$|R

Goodall was engaged at the first clash with the French fleet under the Comte de Grasse off Dominica on 9 April 1782, and again at their decisive defeat at the Battle of the Saintes on 12 April. In the former engagement Valiant was part of the van, and was heavily involved in the fighting, suffering casualties of 38 men killed and wounded. At the Saintes Valiant was in the rear division and had nine killed and 28 wounded. After the victory at the Saintes, and during a period of calm weather, Rodney detached a squadron under his second in command, Sir Samuel Hood, to pursue some of the crippled French ships. Valiant was one of the ships detached with Hood, and on 19 April the squadron caught two ships of the line and three frigates {{at the entrance to the}} Mona Passage.

6000|$|... § I. Seven {{miles to}} the north of Venice, the banks of sand, which near the city rise little above {{low-water}} mark, attain by degrees a higher level, and knit themselves at last into fields of salt morass, raised here and there into shapeless mounds, and intercepted by narrow creeks of sea. One of the feeblest of these inlets, after winding for some time among buried fragments of masonry, and knots of sunburnt weeds whitened with webs of fucus, stays itself in an utterly stagnant pool beside a plot of greener grass covered with ground ivy and violets. On this mound is built a rude brick campanile, of the commonest Lombardic type, which if we ascend towards evening (and there are none to hinder us, the door of its ruinous staircase swinging idly on its hinges), we may command from {{it one of the most}} notable scenes in this wide world of ours. Far as the eye can reach, a waste of wild sea moor, of a lurid ashen grey; not like our northern moors with their jet-black pools and purple heath, but lifeless, the color of sackcloth, with the corrupted sea-water soaking through the roots of its acrid weeds, and gleaming hither and thither through its snaky channels. No gathering of fantastic mists, nor coursing of clouds across it; but melancholy clearness of space in the warm sunset, oppressive, reaching to the horizon of its level gloom. To the very horizon, on the north-east; but, to the north and west, there is a blue line of higher land along the border of it, and above this, but farther back, a misty band of mountains, touched with snow. To the east, the paleness and roar of the Adriatic, louder at momentary intervals as the surf breaks on the bars of sand; to the south, the widening branches of the calm lagoon, alternately purple and pale green, as they reflect the evening clouds or twilight sky; and almost beneath our feet, on the same field which sustains the tower we gaze from, a group of four buildings, two of them little larger than cottages (though built of stone, and one adorned by a quaint belfry), the third an octagonal chapel, of which we can see but little more than the flat red roof with its rayed tiling, the fourth, a considerable church with nave and aisles, but of which, in like manner, we can see little but the long central ridge and lateral slopes of roof, which the sunlight separates in one glowing mass from the green field beneath and grey moor beyond. There are no living creatures near the buildings, nor any vestige of village or city round about them. They lie like a little company of <b>ships</b> <b>becalmed</b> on a far-away sea.|$|R
