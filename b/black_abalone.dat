25|$|Humans have {{harvested}} black abalones {{along the}} California Coast {{for at least}} 10,000 years. On San Miguel Island, archaeological evidence shows that the Island Chumash people and their ancestors ate <b>black</b> <b>abalone</b> for millennia and also used the shells to make fishhooks, beads, and ornaments. After the Chumash and other California Indians were devastated by European diseases, and sea otters were nearly eradicated from California waters by the historic fur trade, <b>black</b> <b>abalone</b> populations rebounded and attracted an intensive intertidal fishery conducted primarily by Chinese immigrants from the 1850s to about 1900.|$|E
25|$|This {{used to be}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} large marine mollusk on the west coast of North America, but now, because of overfishing and the Withering Syndrome, it has much declined in population and the IUCN Red List has classed the <b>black</b> <b>abalone</b> as Critically Endangered.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Black</b> <b>abalone</b> have {{dramatically}} declined in numbers throughout their historical range, and are locally extirpated in certain areas.

[...] <b>Black</b> <b>abalone</b> were the last to be targeted, with the peak harvest occurring in the 1970s. Additionally, improved harvesting technologies that expanded the harvesting areas and supported larger harvests per unit effort were not initiated. Now, all abalone fisheries in California are managed by the California Department of Fish and Game, which restricts the size of abalones caught, and the season in which harvesting can take place. In Mexico, there is a total allowable catch limit for black abalones. Even though harvesting <b>black</b> <b>abalone</b> is [...] regulated in California, poaching still occurs.

40|$|Determination that an Incidental Harassment Authorization is the {{appropriate}} permitting option for the subject activity: 1) Is there any potential for serious injury or mortality to marine mammals {{in the area of}} activity? Activity involves research on populations of <b>black</b> <b>abalones</b> (Haliotis cracherodii Leach, 1814) in rocky intertidal habitats at San Nicolas Island, California. The applicant made 111 separate field trips to San Nicolas Island from September 1979 through October 2007, with each trip averaging approximately 6 days in length.

2500|$|<b>Black</b> <b>abalone</b> reach sexual {{maturity}} at 3 years and can live 30 years or more. [...] Spawning occurs {{in spring and}} early summer; occasionally, a second spawn occurs in the fall. [...] <b>Black</b> <b>abalone</b> are broadcast spawners, and successful spawning requires that individuals be grouped closely together. [...] Larvae are free-swimming for between 5 and 14 days before they settle onto hard substrate, usually near larger individuals, where they then metamorphose into their adult form, develop a shell and settle onto a rock. Juveniles do not tend to disperse great distances, and current populations of <b>black</b> <b>abalone</b> are generally composed of individuals that were spawned locally. Juveniles settle in crevices and remain hidden until they reach approximately 4inches in length. [...] At that point, adults congregate in more exposed areas such as rocks and in tide pools. [...] They {{are thought to be}} able to live for between 25 and 75 years, and will begin to reproduce between three and seven years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{depleted}} {{stocks of}} <b>black</b> <b>abalone</b> were further reduced by Withering syndrome, first discovered in 1985, when commercial fishermen reported {{large numbers of}} empty shells and dying abalones {{on the shores of}} several of the Californian Channel Islands (including the islands of Santa Cruz, Anacapa, Santa Rosa, Santa Barbara, San Miguel, and San Clemente). [...] This disease impairs the production of digestive enzymes, effectively starving the abalone to death. Following onset of symptoms, the animal usually quickly dies. [...] In many locations, percentages greater than 90% of individuals have been lost, and in some places, a total loss of the <b>black</b> <b>abalone</b> population occurred. The disease spread from the Channel Islands to the mainland coast in 1992, where it devastated most populations in warmer waters south of Point Conception or in locally warmer waters further north.|$|E

40|$|Dense {{populations of}} <b>black</b> <b>abalones</b> (Haliotis cracherodii Leach) were {{monitored}} in permanent intertidal plots at nine sites on San Nicolas Island from 1981 through 1990. Densities were essentially constant at all four sites {{along the north}} shore of the island throughout the study period. Densities at five sites along the south shore were more variable, possibly reflecting asynchronous variation in recruitment, mortality resulting from wave disturbance, and removal by people. Temporal variation of abalone densities apparently was not influenced by sea otters or abalone withering syndrome during this study. Abalones were strongly aggregated in space. Highest densities occurred in areas of irregular substrata, apparently as a result of preference for crevices and vertical faces. The locations of dense patches were persistent in time...|$|R

40|$|Project {{efficiency}} was enhanced {{along with}} economic savings through reduced per diem costs with the move of two project biologists to the Diablo Canyon area. A total of 765 field and laboratory man-days was spent surveying 189 intertidal, subtidal, and fishing stations, processing algae samples, and compiling data. A new subtidal study of random 1 / 4 m 2 quadrats was begun {{this year to}} better assess small invertebrates. Three new permanent intertidal stations were established in transition areas outside of Diablo Cove to monitor thermal impact on abalones. Giant red sea urchin densities continued to decline in both subtidal study areas, while densities of large brown algae continued to increase. Numbers of intertidal <b>black</b> and red <b>abalones</b> from parallel to shoreline stations showed little change. Perpendicular to shore stations yielded higher mean densities of <b>black</b> <b>abalones</b> than the parallel stations. Sea otter movements and fluctuations in monthly counts generally paralleled those of previous years. The commercial sea urchin fishery was inactive most of the year, and commercial abalone fishing effort continued to decline. No effort from either fishery was observed in Diablo Cove. Observations on natural and power plant produced foam within Diablo Cove were begun during this report period...|$|R

40|$|More {{stations}} were surveyed during this report period than during any previous period. A total of 818 mandays was spent surveying 18 permanent and 67 random subtidal stations, 19 permanent and 50 random intertidal stations, and 64 sportfish catch-per-unit-of-effort stations, {{as well as}} conducting corollary laboratory work. In the subtidal areas, Laminaria dentigera and Pterygophora californica, both important subsurface kelp species, increased in their combined total numbers from the 1976 survey. However, Nereocystis luetkeana, the bull kelp, declined substantially in all study areas. Population trends {{of many of the}} dominant subtidal macro-invertebrates have varied depending on the species and on the type of method utilized. Regression analyses have been performed on selected species for numbers versus depth. Red algal abundance and diversity appear to have increased in both subtidal study areas. Of the three observation areas, sea otters were observed least frequently in Diablo Cove. However, there continues to be fresh evidence of otter foraging within Diablo Cove. Several seasons' data for intertidal algae and invertebrates have been summarized for one study area. While the algae biomass shows a fairly clear seasonality of abundance, the trends in numbers of the six invertebrate species considered are not as well defined. Because of high variability in the data, the sportfish catch-per-unit-of-effort and hook-and-line study was cancelled in December. Populations of intertidal red and <b>black</b> <b>abalones,</b> Haliotis rufescens and H. cracherodii, respectively, appear to have remained fairly stable during the 1976 - 77 period.
