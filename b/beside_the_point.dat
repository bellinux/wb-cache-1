25|$|The {{relationship}} between Barth, liberalism, and fundamentalism {{goes far beyond}} the issue of inerrancy, however. From Barth's perspective, liberalism, as understood {{in the sense of}} the 19th century with Friedrich Schleiermacher and Hegel as its leading exponents and not necessarily expressed in any particular political ideology, is the divinization of human thinking. This, to him, inevitably leads one or more philosophical concepts to become the false God, thus attempting to block the true voice of the living God. This, in turn, leads to the captivity of theology by human ideology. In Barth's theology, he emphasizes again and again that human concepts of any kind, breadth or narrowness quite <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>point,</b> can never be considered as identical to God's revelation. In this aspect, Scripture is also written human language, which bears witness to the self-revelation of God in Jesus Christ. Scripture cannot be considered as identical to God's self-revelation, which is properly only Jesus Christ. However, in his freedom and love, God truly reveals himself through human language and concepts, with a view toward their necessity in reaching fallen humanity. Thus Barth claims that Christ is truly presented in Scripture and the preaching of the church, echoing a stand expressed in his native Swiss Reformed Church's Helvetic Confession of the 16th century.|$|E

500|$|No {{artist was}} ever more true to his aim.

Insofar as this was directed against the lack of realism in his pictures, it was <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> The earth, the sky, the rocks, the trees, {{the men and women of}} Burne-Jones are not those of this world; but they are themselves a world, consistent with itself, and having therefore its own reality. Charged with the beauty and with the strangeness of dreams, it has nothing of a dream's incoherence. Yet it is a dreamer always whose nature penetrates these works, a nature out of sympathy with struggle and strenuous action. Burne-Jones's men and women are dreamers too. It was this which, more than anything else, estranged him from the age into which he was born. But he had an inbred [...] "revolt from fact" [...] which would have estranged him from the actualities of any age. That criticism seems to be more justified which has found in him a lack of such victorious energy and mastery over his materials as would have enabled him to carry out his conceptions in their original intensity. Yet Burne-Jones was singularly strenuous in production. His industry was inexhaustible, and needed to be, if it was to keep pace with the constant pressure of his ideas. Whatever faults his paintings may have, they have always the fundamental virtue of design; they are always pictures. His designs were informed with a mind of romantic temper, apt in the discovery of beautiful subjects, and impassioned with a delight in pure and variegated colour.|$|E

2500|$|Miller was {{determined}} the production {{not become a}} farce, and in that vein, two keys texts were Lawrence Stone's The Family, Sex and Marriage in England: 1500-1800 and Michael Walzer's The Revolution of the Saints, which he used to help ground his interpretation in recognisably Renaissance-esque societal terms; Petruchio's actions are based on accepted economic, social and religious views of the time, as are Baptista's. In tandem with this interpretation, the song sung {{at the end of}} the play is a musical version of Psalm 128 ("Blessed is everyone that feareth the Lord"), which was often sung in Puritan households at the end of a meal during Shakespeare's own day, and which praised a peaceful family life. Speaking of the addition of the psalm, Miller states [...] "I had to give [...] an explicitly religious format, so people could see it as not just simply the high-jinks of an intolerantly selfish man who was simply destroying a woman to satisfy his own vanity, but a sacramental view of the nature of marriage, whereby this couple had come to love each other by reconciling themselves to the demands of a society which saw obedience as a religious requirement." [...] Along these lines, Miller was also insistent that to interpret the play in light of twentieth century feminism was a flawed approach; [...] "what we think now is really quite <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> If everything is done in the light of what we think, it's a sort of historical egocentricity, which is quite intolerable."

The university depends far more on high school grades, which, as anyone who has taught at the college level knows, cannot be trusted. If last year's freshman classes at several colleges all had composite high school grade point averages of 3.6 to 3.8, I don't know how the intellectual caliber of one differs from another.

[...] The question Thomas asked was whether in 1995 {{it was obvious that}} the [...] "mere act of cuffing petitioner to the restraining bar... violated the Eighth Amendment." [...] In Thomas's view, no prior litigation involving Alabama's use of the restraining bar would have put a reasonable prison guard on notice that the mere act of attaching a prisoner to it would violate the Eighth Amendment. [...] The three federal district courts in Alabama had all rejected this contention, as well as the idea endorsed by the majoritythat exposure to the elements resulting from an extended stay on the hitching post, coupled with the pain caused by the handcuffedwas the wanton and unnecessary infliction of pain. [...] Hope did not allege that the mere act of attaching him to the restraining bar [...] "imposed a substantial risk of serious harm upon him". [...] Nor was it, in light of the district courts' conclusion, [...] "obvious" [...] that this act would have caused Hope harm. [...] There was no evidence that these particular guards had read the Department of Justice's report.

[...] The fact that the guards did not comply with the recordkeeping requirement of the regulation was <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>point,</b> Justice Thomas believed, because Hope never alleged that the guards' failure to do so caused the Eighth Amendment violation. [...] Thomas also read binding Fifth and Eleventh Circuit precedent merely to prohibit [...] "malicious and sadistic" [...] conduct by guards.

2500|$|In the Russian-Japanese {{negotiations}} then followed, although {{by early}} January 1904, the Japanese government had realised that Russia {{was not interested}} in settling the Manchurian or Korean issues. Instead, Russia's goal was buying time – via diplomacy – to further build up militarily. In December 1903, Wilhelm wrote in a marginal note on a diplomatic dispatch about his role in inflaming Russo–Japanese relations:"Since 97-Kiaochow-we have never left Russia in any doubt that we would cover her back in Europe, in case she decided to pursue a bigger policy in the Far East that might lead to military complications (with the aim of relieving our eastern border from the fearful pressure and threat of the massive Russian army!). Whereupon, Russia took Port Arthur and trusting us, took her fleet out of the Baltic, thereby making herself vulnerable to us by sea. In Danzig 01 and Reval 02, the same assurance was given again, with result that entire Russian divisions from Poland and European Russia were and are being sent to the Far East. This would not had happened if our governments had not been in agreement!". A recurring theme of Wilhelm's letters to Nicholas was that [...] "Holy Russia" [...] had been [...] "chosen" [...] by God to save the [...] "entire white race" [...] from the [...] "yellow peril", and that Russia was [...] "entitled" [...] to annex all of Korea, Manchuria, and northern China up to Beijing. Wilhelm went on to assure Nicholas that once Russia had defeated Japan {{that this would be a}} deadly blow to British diplomacy, and the two emperors, the self-proclaimed [...] "Admiral of the Atlantic" [...] and the [...] "Admiral of the Pacific" [...] would rule Eurasia together, making them able to challenge British sea power as the resources of Eurasia would make their empires immune to a British blockade, which would thus allow Germany and Russia to [...] "divide up the best" [...] of the British colonies in Asia between them. Nicholas had been prepared to compromise with Japan, but after receiving a letter from Wilhelm attacking him as a coward for his willingness to compromise with the Japanese (whom Wilhelm never ceasing reminding Nicholas represented the [...] "Yellow Peril") for the sake of peace, become more obstinate. Wilhelm had written to Nicholas stating that the question of Russian interests in Manchuria and Korea was <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>point,</b> saying instead it was a matter of Russia"undertaking the protection and defense of the White Race, and with it, Christian civilization, against the Yellow Race. And whatever the Japs are determined to ensure the domination of the Yellow Race in East Asia, to put themselves at its head and organise and lead it into battle against the White Race. That is the kernel of the situation, and therefore there can be very little doubt about where the sympathies of all half-way intelligent Europeans should lie. England betrayed Europe's interests to America in a cowardly and shameful way over the Panama Canal question, so as to be left in 'peace' by the Yankees. Will the 'Tsar' likewise betray the interests of the White Race to the Yellow as to be 'left in peace' and not embarrass the Hague tribunal too much?". When Nicholas replied that he still wanted peace, Wilhelm wrote back in a telegram [...] "You innocent angel!", telling his advisors [...] "This is the language of an innocent angel. But not that of a White Tsar!". Nevertheless, the belief in Tokyo was that Russia was not serious about seeking a peaceful solution to the dispute, on 13 January 1904, Japan proposed a formula by which Manchuria would be outside the Japanese sphere of influence and, reciprocally, Korea outside Russia's. On 21 December 1903, the Tarō cabinet voted to go to war against Russia.|$|E
