40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} {{and study}} the <b>batched</b> <b>bin</b> packing problem (BBPP), a bin packing problem in which items become available for packing incrementally, one batch at a time. A batched algorithm must pack a batch before the next batch becomes known. A batch may contain several items; the special case when each batch consists of merely one item is the well-studied on-line bin packing problem. We obtain lower bounds for the asymptotic competitive ratio of any algorithm for the BBPP with two batches. We believe that our main lower bound is optimal and provide some support to this conjecture. We suggest studying BBPP and other batched problems...|$|R

40|$|A {{discrete}} element model (DEM) {{has been}} developed for an industrial <b>batch</b> <b>bin</b> blender in which three different types of materials are mixed. The mixing dynamics have been evaluated from a model-based study {{with respect to the}} blend critical quality attributes (CQAs) which are relative standard deviation (RSD) and segregation intensity. In the actual industrial setup, a sensor mounted on the blender lid is used to determine the blend composition in this region. A model-based analysis has been used to understand the mixing efficiency in the other zones inside the blender and to determine if the data obtained near the blender-lid region are able to provide a good representation of the overall blend quality. Sub-optimal mixing zones have been identified and other potential sampling locations have been investigated in order to obtain a good approximation of the blend variability. The model has been used to study how the mixing efficiency can be improved by varying the key processing parameters, i. e., blender RPM/speed, fill level/volume and loading order. Both segregation intensity and RSD reduce at a lower fill level and higher blender RPM and are a function of the mixing time. This work demonstrates the use of a model-based approach to improve process knowledge regarding a pharmaceutical mixing process. The model can be used to acquire qualitative information about the influence of different critical process parameters and equipment geometry on the mixing dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Estimating {{quantile}} sensitivities {{is important}} in many optimization applications, from hedging in financial engineering to service-level constraints in inventory control to more general chance constraints in stochastic programming. Recently, Hong (Hong, L. J. 2009. Estimating quantile sensitivities. Oper. Res. 57 118 - 130) derived a batched infinitesimal perturbation analysis estimator for quantile sensitivities, and Liu and Hong (Liu, G., L. J. Hong. 2009. Kernel estimation of quantile sensitivities. Naval Res. Logist. 56 511 - 525) derived a kernel estimator. Both of these estimators are consistent with convergence rates bounded by n - 1 / 3 and n - 2 / 5, respectively. In this paper, we use conditional Monte Carlo to derive a consistent quantile sensitivity estimator that improves upon these convergence rates and requires no <b>batching</b> or <b>binning.</b> We illustrate the new estimator using a simple but realistic portfolio credit risk example, for which the previous work is inapplicable. quantiles, value at risk, credit risk, Monte Carlo simulation, gradient estimation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel ICP variant {{that uses a}} {{histogram}} in conjunction with multiple closest points to detect the overlap area between range images geing registered. Tentative correspondences sharing similar distances are normally all within, or all outside, the overlap area. Thus, the overlap area can be detected in a <b>bin</b> by <b>bin</b> <b>batch</b> manner using a histogram. Using multiple closest points is likely to enlarge the distance difference for tentative correspondences in the histogram, and pull together the images being registered, facilitating the overlap area detection. Our experimental results based on real range images show that the performance of our proposed algorithm enhances {{the state of the}} art. ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{agricultural}} {{food products}} undergo {{some form of}} drying before they are available for purchase. This paper describes the progress of a liquid desiccant solar crop drying system (LDSCD), which is currently being tested in Queensland, Australia. The prototype consists of <b>batch</b> grain drying <b>bin,</b> air-drying sub-system and a regeneration sub-system. In the liquid desiccant system technology the use of electricity is limited to circulating air and liquids. The weak desiccant is regenerated using thermal energy provided by a solar collector and a heat exchanger. Initial {{results show that the}} LDSCD is an achievable alternative to conventional drying techniques. The drying system can deliver air at very low relative humidity (RH) regardless of ambient conditions and with small increase in drying temperature. On completion, the proposed project would make drying grain and other agricultural products more viable in the tropics (Atherton Tableland), where high ambient relative humidity makes heated-air dryers expensive to operate. The system would also have appeal in the colder parts of the country (such as in Victoria and Tasmania) where high humidity and low temperatures also make drying more expensive...|$|R
40|$|In an {{unprotected}} {{environment of}} Wireless Sensor Network, the authentication scheme for multicast secure communication {{has to be}} designed with limited usage of resources and computation. In Multicast Authentication Based on Batch Signature-Enhanced (MABS-E) scheme, a tree construction to counteract the Denial of Service (DoS) attack requires latency at the sender. This authentication latency leads to the jitter effect on real-time applications at the receiver. In few applications, user mobility is considered for authentication process. And also, due to user mobility, the sensor node is compromised. This paper proposes a technique called <b>Batch</b> based Selective <b>Bin</b> Verification (BSBV), which avoids the construction of merkle tree. It reduces latency and allows the receiver to tolerate DoS attack even in the case where the attack fails to be detected. In order to prevent to compromise a node, re-authentication scheme is employed, can prolong the lifetime of the sensor network is provided. The number of inspections of each packet is decreased when binning technique is used. In BSBV technique, the packet failure rate is decreased to 0. 01 from 0. 04 because all are verified with the batch verification, when the chosen bin is two. The Packet Delivery Ratio is 82. 95 % when fifteen malicious nodes are presented...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 229 - 239). Multi-view shape-from-silhouette {{systems are}} increasingly used for analysing stones. This thesis presents methods to estimate stone shape and to recognise individual stones from their silhouettes. Calibration of two image capture setups is investigated. First, a setup {{consisting of two}} mirrors and a camera is introduced. Pose and camera internal parameters are inferred from silhouettes alone. Second. the conﬁguration and calibration of a high throughput multi-camera setup is covered. Multiple silhouette sets of a stone are merged into a single set by inferring relative poses between sets. This is achieved by adjusting pose parameters to maximise geometrical consistency speciﬁed by the epipolar tangency constraint. Shape properties (such as volume, flatness, and eiongation) are inferred more accurately from the merged silhouette sets than from the original silhouette sets. Merging is used to recognise individual stones from pairs of silhouette sets captured on different occasions. Merged sets with sufﬁcient geometrical consistency are classiﬁed as matches (produced by the same stone), whereas inconsistent sets are classiﬁed as mismatches. Batch matching is determining the one-to-one correspondence between two unordered batches of silhouette sets of the same batch of stones. A probabilistic framework is used to combine recognition by merging (which is slow, but accurate) with the efﬁciency of computing shape distribution-based dissimilarity values. Two unordered batches of 1200 six-view silhouette sets of uncut gemstones are correctly matched in approximately 68 seconds (using a 3. 2 GHz Pentium 4 machine]. An experiment that compares silhouette-based shape estimates with mechanical sieving demonstrates an application using the developed methods. A batch of 494 garnets is sieved 15 times. After each sieving, silhouette sets are captured for sub-batches in each <b>bin.</b> <b>Batch</b> matching is {{used to determine the}} IS sieve bins per stone. Better estimates of repeatability, and better understanding of the variability of the sieving process is obtained than if only histograms (the natural output of sieving) were considered. Silhouette-based sieve emulation is found to be more repeatable than mechanical sieving...|$|R
