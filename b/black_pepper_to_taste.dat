40|$|ABSTRACT: Phytophthora {{foot rot}} of <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> {{is one of}} the most serious {{production}} constraints. As part of the disease management, a number of Trichoderma isolates were isolated and screened both in vitro and in vivo. Five efficient isolates tested in the field were monitored and statistically analyzed for three years. There was reduction in the disease incidence over the years of study, where these isolates were applied. Isolates (T. virens- 12 & T. harzianum- 26) were found more effective to control the disease and isolate T. harzianum- 26 most adaptive to the rhizosphere of <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> as compared <b>to</b> other isolates. Key words: Biological control, Phytophthora foot rot, Piper nigrum, Trichoderma The production of <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> (Piper nigrum L.) is hampered by diseases not only in India but also in other <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> growing countries. Among the serious diseases affecting <b>black</b> <b>pepper,</b> Phytophthora foot rot caused by Phytophthora capsici is very serious (Anandaraj et al., 1996). On global scale, an annual crop loss of $ 4. 5 - 7. 5 million has been reported due to foot rot alone (De Waard, 1979). Crop loss due to foot rot in Kerala was estimated to range from 3. 4 - 9. 4 % (Anadaraj et at., 1989). The fungus is soil borne and all parts of <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> are prone <b>to</b> infection. Infected plant debris in the soil and infected and dried up vines in the gardens appear to be the primary source of inoculum (Anandaraj, 1997). Present study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different Trichoderma isolates, isolated from rhizosphere areas of <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> <b>to</b> suppress the foot rot incidences. Twenty-seven isolates of Trichoderma were isolated and screened against P. capsici both in vitro and in vivo. Five efficient isolates have been selected based on the in vivo studies and used in the field for evaluation. Field experiment was conducted for three consecutiv...|$|R

50|$|It {{is used in}} West African cuisine {{where it}} imparts heat and a pungent aroma to classic West African stews. Even in West Africa, Ashanti pepper is an {{expensive}} spice and is used sparingly. Often, a few grains are in a pestle and mortar before being added (along with <b>black</b> <b>pepper)</b> <b>to</b> soups or to boiled rice. The spice can also be substituted in any recipe using cubeb pepper, where Ashanti imparts a less bitter flavour. The pepper is also sometimes one of the ingredients in the Berbere spice mix used in the cuisines of Ethiopia and of Eritrea. However, West African Pepper is a highly esteemed spice in its region of origin and {{may be hard to}} get abroad; thus, long pepper is more often used in Berbere.|$|R

40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>pepper</b> is used {{worldwide}} {{to enhance}} food flavor. We investigated dietary supplementation with piperine, the active principle of <b>black</b> <b>pepper,</b> <b>to</b> high carbohydrate, high fat (HCHF) diet-fed rats {{as a model}} of human metabolic syndrome. Rats were fed with either HCHF diet (carbohydrate, 52 %; fat, 24 %; 25 % fructose in drinking water) or cornstarch (CS) diet for a total of 16 weeks. Diets of the treatment groups (CS + piperine and HCHF + piperine) were supplemented with piperine for the last 8 weeks of this protocol. After 16 weeks, rats fed with HCHF diet developed hypertension, elevated oxidative stress and inflammation-induced cardiac changes (infiltration of inflammatory cells in heart, increase in count and degranulation of mast cells in heart, cardiac fibrosis and increase in ventricular stiffness), reduced responsiveness of aortic rings, impaired glucose tolerance, abdominal obesity together with liver fibrosis, fat deposition and increased plasma liver enzymes. Supplementation with piperine (375 mg/kg food; approximately 30 mg/kg/day) in HCHF-fed rats normalized blood pressure, improved glucose tolerance and reactivity of aortic rings, reduced plasma parameters of oxidative stress and inflammation, attenuated cardiac and hepatic inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis and improved liver function. These changes clearly suggest that piperine reduces symptoms of human metabolic syndrome in HCHF-fed rats by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. ...|$|R

40|$|Aims: Phytophthora capsici {{is a major}} {{pathogen}} of <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> and zoospores play {{an important}} role in the infection process. Fluorescent pseudomonads that produce biosurfactants with zoosporicidal activities were isolated from the <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> rhizosphere in Vietnam, and their genotypic diversity and potential to control Phy. capsici root rot was determined. Methods: Biosurfactant-producing pseudomonads were genotypically and biochemically characterized by BOX-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 16 S-rDNA sequencing, reverse-phase-high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-masss spectrometry analyses. Results: Biosurfactant-producing fluorescent pseudomonads make up c. 1. 3 % of the culturable Pseudomonas population in the rhizosphere of <b>black</b> <b>pepper.</b> Although BOX-PCR revealed substantial genotypic diversity, the isolates were shown to produce the same biosurfactants and were all identified as Pseudomonas putida. When applied <b>to</b> <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> stem cuttings, several of the biosurfactant-producing strains provided significant disease control. In absence of the disease, several of the bacterial strains promoted shoot and root growth of <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> stem cuttings. Conclusions: Biosurfactant-producing pseudomonads indigenous to the rhizosphere of <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> plants are genotypically diverse and provide a novel resource for the control of Phy. capsici root rot and growth promotion of <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> stem cuttings. Significance and Impact of the Study: The results of this study provide a strong basis for further development of supplementary strategies with antagonistic bacteria to control foot and root rot of <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> and <b>to</b> promote plant growth...|$|R
