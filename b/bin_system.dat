30|$|To the {{knowledge}} of the author, depthMap’s algorithm has not been formally documented. While the C++ source code (Varoudis 2015) is available but is too complex to be mapped completely. Therefore, we refer to various relevant sources that discuss some aspects and features of that algorithm. Firstly, the original developer of depthMap, Turner (2001 b), stated that the pathfinding is done separately for each point (on the grid). He stated that the reason was not to consume a large memory considering the limits of memory size in early 2000 s. Although his notion pertained to before the inclusion of angular analysis in depthMap, it still seems to be the used basis. This indicates that depthMap may have not been optimized through a table like β in Viraph and thus it recalculates several paths. Secondly, regarding the source code, depthMap apparently uses a “bin” system for pathfinding. In this system, the real-number angles are rounded and represented by integer steps. It seems that depthMap uses a 32 -bin system (i.e. 8 “octant” bins for every exact 45 degrees, and 24 bins – 8 × 3 – for every 15 -degree portions between two octants) to record angles and directions of movement. The <b>bin</b> <b>system</b> would significantly increase the calculation speed (as opposed to actual angles), as it is clearly stated in depthMap’s interface for axial analysis and also in agent-based modelling in VGA (Koutsolampros & Varoudis, 2017). If this speculation is correct, it may reduce the accuracy of the measurement considering the maximum error margin of < 15 °. In any case, it seems that depthMap uses a variant of Dijkstra algorithm from this point to navigate through the graph. The <b>bin</b> <b>system</b> is only used for navigation. Once a path is found, the accumulative angle is calculated accurately based on the actual points on the path.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{geometrid}} moths of Europe {{are one of}} {{the best}} investigated insect groups in traditional taxonomy making them an ideal model group to test the accuracy of the Barcode Index Number (<b>BIN)</b> <b>system</b> of BOLD (Barcode of Life Datasystems), a method that supports automated, rapid species delineation and identification. [br/] Methodology/Principal Findings: This study provides a DNA barcode library for 219 of the 249 European geometrid moth species (88 %) in five selected subfamilies. The data set includes COI sequences for 2130 specimens. Most species (93 %) were found to possess diagnostic barcode sequences at the European level while only three species pairs (3 %) were genetically indistinguishable in areas of sympatry. As a consequence, 97 % of the European species we examined were unequivocally discriminated by barcodes within their natural areas of distribution. We found a 1 : 1 correspondence between BINs and traditionally recognized species for 67 % of these species. Another 17 % of the species (15 pairs, three triads) shared BINs, while specimens from the remaining species (18 %) were divided among two or more BINs. Five of these species are mixtures, both sharing and splitting BINs. For 82 % of the species with two or more BINs, the genetic splits involved allopatric populations, many of which have previously been hypothesized to represent distinct species or subspecies. [br/] Conclusions/Significance: This study confirms the effectiveness of DNA barcoding as a tool for species identification and illustrates the potential of the <b>BIN</b> <b>system</b> to characterize formal genetic units independently of an existing classification. This suggests the system can be used to efficiently assess the biodiversity of large, poorly known assemblages of organisms. For the moths examined in this study, cases of discordance between traditionally recognized species and BINs arose from several causes including overlooked species, synonymy, and cases where DNA barcodes revealed regional variation of uncertain taxonomic significance...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Agricultural {{implement}} draft requirements {{depend on}} forces necessary to compress, shear, displace, accelerate and sometimes pulverize soil. These forces depend on (a) implement operating parameters, (b) soil properties and (c) implement geometry (James et. al., 1996). Experimental and theoretical analyses techniques {{are essential to}} develop efficient tillage or soil cutting tools. Soil <b>bin,</b> an experimental <b>system,</b> is a generic term for a test facility for studying soil dynamics, specifically for soil-machine interaction research in agriculture (Mahadi, 2005). Considerable experimental analysis has been done using indoor soil <b>bin</b> test <b>systems</b> under controlled soil condition. However, the parameters resulting from controlled soil conditions will not meet the actual field soil conditions. Thus, {{the objective of this}} research is to design and install a portable in-situ soil <b>bin</b> test <b>system,</b> and to use this system for experimentation with six different ploughshare geometries. This will give information on how geommetry and working conditions affect draught and power requirements for soil manipulations under actual field soil conditions. In the experimental design it is foreseen that the experimentation will be undertaken at three plough planes i. e. surface, at 20 cm depth, and at 40 cm depth. At each plane, ploughing will be undertaken at three different angles of the ploughshare i. e. 80, 150, and 240 representing primary, secondary, and tertiary tillage. Following experimentation and the signal analysis,, multi linear and linear regression are to be performed tocorrelate draught force with soil physical and mechanical properties, tillage tool geometry, travel speed, tillage depth, tillage angle, and furrow profile. The soil physical and mechanical properties are: bulk density, moisture content, penetration resistance, clay content, and silt content. Deliverables: D 1 : Design and installation of in-situ portable Soil <b>Bin</b> Test <b>System</b> is documented D 2 : Values about Tillage Depth, Tillage Angle, Travel Speed, Furrow Profile of the three planes at three different angles of plough with replicas from three sites at wet and dry conditions are reported Milestone: M 1 : Effect of Moisture Content, Bulk Density, Tillage Depth, Tillage Angle, Travel Speed, Furrow Profile, Soil Compaction, Clay Content, and Silt Content on Draught Requirement is investigated. M 2 : Effect of tool geometry on draught and soil manipulation is investigated INTRODUCTION The term tillage embraces all operations of seedbed preparation that optimize soil and environmental conditions for seed germination, seedling establishment and crop growth (FAO, 1994). The primary objectives of tillage are seedbed preparation, provision of a good medium for plant roots, water infiltration and retention, erosion and weed control (FAO, 1993). Tillage modifies soil surface structure, total porosity, macro-porosity, pore continuity and pore size distribution and therefore has great influence on the hydrology of an agricultural catchments (Mwendera, 1992). A granular structure is desirable to allow rapid infiltration and good retention of rainfall to provide adequate moisture and air exchange capacity within the soil and to minimize resistance to root penetration (Kelemu, 2001). A good seedbed generally implies finer particles and greater firmness {{in the vicinity of the}} seeds. However, the mechanical manipulation of soil (Kaumbutho et al., 2004) should be done carefully and adequately; otherwise, it leads to extreme soil disturbance, which in turn results in deteriorative consequences. The new tillage systems and the need for improved energy efficiency of tillage operations do put an emphasis for optimizing tillage tool design. This can be done by two different techniques, namely by experiment and by theoretical analysis techniques (Plouffe et al., 1999 a & b; Mouazen and Neményi, 1998). These methodologies could significantly assist in optimizing the implement designs and operational conditions aiming at minimum draught requirement and best soil manipulation performance. Soil <b>bin</b> test <b>system</b> technique is a means of experimental verification essential to develop efficient tillage or soil cutting tools. The requirement of such efficient tillage technique is to consume less energy and provide a satisfactory soil condition for crop emergence and growth. The field experiment allows prototype verification with specialized instrumented equipment (McLaughlin et al., 1993). Various researchers studied the draught requirement with respect to different soil and tillage parameters (Gill and Vanden Berg, 1967; Eradat Oskoui et. al 1982; Ayers and Perumpral, 1982; Koolen and Kuipers, 1983; Kydd et al., 1984; Upadhyaya et al. 1984; Busscher and Sojka, 1987; Young et al. 1988; Mouazen and Ramon, 2002; Bernier et al., 1989; Erbach et al., 1992; Oni et al., 1992; Shirin et al., 1993; Evans et al., 1996; Fielke, 1996; McKyes and Maswaure, 1997; Onwualu and Watts, 1998; Al-Janobi and Al-Suhaibani, 1998; Mapfumo and Chanasyk, 1998; Unger and Jones, 1998; Manian et al., 2000; Shrestha et al., 2001; Gratton et al., 2003; McLaughlin and Campbell, 2004). Although several reports on the effects of draught on the performances of different tillage tools and implements are available in the literature, there is dearth of information on experimentation of maresha plough with soil <b>bin</b> test <b>system.</b> Hence, the aim of this research is thesis aims to: (i) review research attempts on animal drawn implements; and soil <b>bin</b> test <b>systems,</b> techniques, and applications; (ii) describe the development of a mobile in-situ soil bin testing device; (iii) report the observations and insights gained from the field experiments; (iv) investigate the effect of maresha plough geometry on draught requirement and soil loosening; and (v) lay platform for further research. To do this, the design and installation of a portable and in-situ soil <b>bin</b> test <b>system</b> allows for controlled experimentation under field conditions. 1. 1 Why portable and in-situ soil <b>bin</b> test <b>system</b> Indoor soil <b>bins</b> provide tremendous benefits to researchers. But there are limitations with indoor soil <b>bin</b> test <b>systems</b> i. e. Indoor soil bins are built under dimensional constraints. Indoor soil bins have a limit in maximum loads. Most indoor soil bins are in a closed confinement. Replicate measurements on indoor bins always occur on disturbed and artificially conditioned soil Indoor soil bin does not consider the existence of vegetation and crop residue that affect the actual performance which cannot be replicated in an indoor soil bin. MATERIALS AND METHODS The portable and in-situ soil <b>bin</b> test <b>system</b> is designed and implemented by integrating measurement system (sensors, and data acquisition system). Draught is to be measured using force sensors (load cells), and online measurement of tillage speed and tillage depth using encoders and LVDT. Using core samplers, soil samples will be taken from field at 2 m interval, and accordingly bulk density, moisture content, clay content, and silt content are to be determined in laboratory. Soil penetration mesaurements are also done at these locations. Experimental Design The experimental design of in-situ and portable soil bin test sytem will consider six geometries: maresha without wing, maresha with wing, tenkara kind, duck foot plough, two modified plough geometries (modified plough 1, modified plough 2). Experiments will be undertaken at three planes to gain information of effect of soil compaction layers: surface ploughing, ploughing at 20 cm depth, ploughing at 40 cm depth. At each plough plane, ploughing will be undertaken at three different angles of ploughing/attack i. e. 80, 150, and 240 for the respective geometries. The soil bin consists of a carriage on which the instruments and plough shares are mounted. The carriage itself moves on an adapted rail track. The rail has 20 m length, and at both ends 2 m length is excavated to 60 cm depth for the start and end of a test run. This yields 16 m effective ploughing length and accordingly the starting and ending of ploughing is defined. The online parameters to be measured are draft force, tillage depth, and speed. At 2 m interval, soil samples will be taken to determine bulk density and moisture content in the laboratory. Penetration resistance and furrow areas and shapes will be measured at same distance interval. Tests in the dry season allow for controlled moisture conditioning of the soil: the soil shall get wet using partition dams with water application of 100 lt/m 2, and to be covered with plastic for three days. Two experimental designs which will be applicable at three sites with different soil types are proposed and are under review. 2. 2 Design and establishment of portable and in-stiu Soil <b>Bin</b> Test <b>System</b> Design and construction of rail and carriage system: The portable soil <b>bin</b> test <b>system</b> is designed and the components are pair of rails having 20 m length, carriage, and treated wooden footings. For experimental purpose, three rows are established, and the schematic layout is presented below. Design of sensor attachments: Design of measurement system for portable soil <b>bin</b> test <b>system</b> is performed. The soil <b>bin</b> test <b>system</b> incorporates load cell attachments for surface, at 20 cm depth, and at 40 cm depth ploughings. The load cells are connected by a cable to a data logger; and data presentation is displayed by means of PC running data acquisition system and DasyLab software package. Analog to Digital conversion System: The computer-based instrument acquires data in a rather straightforward system. A load cell picks up the force deformation and this analog information is received by the data acquisition hardware and digitized. The digitized value is sent to the computer and received by the data acquisition software. The software then interprets the value, conditions, scales, and displays and stores the data. The data acquisition hardware is from IOtech and composed of DBK 43 A (8 -channel strain gage module), DagBook/ 2000 E (Ethernet 16 -bit, 200 -kHz data acquisition system; includes DaqView software), DBK 203 (Screw-terminal adapter board in rugged metal enclosure for DaqBoard/ 2000 series; P 1 /P 2 /P 3, analog and digital I/O expansion ports), DBK 34 A (uninterruptible Power Supply for DC powered systems), and CA- 37 - 3 T (expansion cable from DaqBook to DBK modules). A software program called DASYLab, windows-based graphical data acquisition software package, is usede for data acquisition. The DASYLab uses icon-based flowchart, the job of communicating with the hardware is taken care of by a driver. Data Analyses: After suitable filtering to remove measurement noise, the force and speed signals are available for analysis. Multi linear and linear regression are to be performed to correlate draught force with moisture content, bulk density, tillage depth, tillage angle, travel speed, penetration resistance, furrow profile, clay content, and silt content. 3 Ph. D. STATUS The doctoral research is based on experimentation using portable and in-situ soil <b>bin</b> test <b>system,</b> and instrumentation of two-wheel tractor. Literature review has been undertaken, and the in-situ and portable soil <b>bin</b> test <b>system</b> is designed and installed in Mekelle University, Ethiopia. Attachement which helps to plough at three planes i. e. surface, 20 cm depth, and 40 cm are designed, manufactured and tested. Experimentation was undertaken at three plough planes: surface, at 20 cm depth, and 40 cm depth; and at three different angle of plough. The respective depths are prepared by removing strip of 40 cm width soil so as to investigate the effect of hardpan on soil tillage. Soil samples were also taken at 2 m interval using core samplers to determine moisture content and bulk density. Preliminary data analyses were also undertaken. The progress of the work was presented on seminar held on Nov 17, 2010 at KU Leuven. The following points were raised: experimental design with randomization; changing the pulling rope with steel chain because of elasticity; and topography of the selected plot which need to be plain enough, and start of ploughing somehow from relatively bottom so that to avoid inertia effect of the carriage. Besides, instead of measuring tillage depth manually and caluclating speed as function of total distance travelled and time elapsed, it is recommended to incorprate encoder and LVDT so that to have online data measurement. With regard to wheel slip, two encoders recommended to be incorporated on the design, one to be attached at the drive wheel and the other one at the free wheel. In order to avoid noise on measurement, grounding the -ve of battery, and sheilding of all cables with aluminium foil and grounding to the same point was recommended; with this, data was taken and displayed data was seen with lesser noise. For further data measurement and signal analyses, it is recommended to design filter in order to avoid noise on measrement, and the process is on progress. Experimental design and daily basis work plan is submitted and it is on review. From Feb 2011 to Sep 2011, in Mekelle University - Ethiopia, the measurement system will be modified to incorporate the above mentioned recommendations and intensive data will be taken from three sites. Data analyses and interpretation will then follow from Oct 2011 up to Mar 2012 at KU Leuven. status: accepte...|$|R

A comparison of minimum distances between the nearest neighbors revealed the mean divergence of 5. 52 % that is approximately the same as observed earlier with comparable sampling in Lepidoptera, but clearly less than in Coleoptera. Full barcode-sharing was observed between 13 species pairs or triplets, equaling to 7. 36 % of all species. Delimitation based on Barcode Index Number (<b>BIN)</b> <b>system</b> was compared with traditional classification of species and interesting cases of possible species oversplits and cryptic diversity are discussed. Overall, DNA barcodes are effective in separating tachinid species and provide novel insight into the taxonomy of several genera...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{assembly}} of a DNA barcode reference library for species in the lepidopteran superfamily Noctuoidea from Canada and the USA. Based on the analysis of 69, 378 specimens, the library provides coverage for 97. 3 % of the noctuoid fauna (3565 of 3664 species). In addition to verifying the strong performance of DNA barcodes in the discrimination of these species, the results indicate close congruence {{between the number of}} species analyzed (3565) and the number of sequence clusters (3816) recognized by the Barcode Index Number (<b>BIN)</b> <b>system.</b> Distributional patterns across 12 North American ecoregions are examined for the 3251 species that have GPS data while BIN analysis is used to quantify overlap between the noctuoid faunas of North America and other zoogeographic regions. This analysis reveals that 90 % of North American noctuoids are endemic and that just 7. 5 % and 1. 8 % of BINs are shared with the Neotropics and with the Palearctic, respectively. One third (29) of the latter species are recent introductions and, as expected, they possess low intraspecific divergences...|$|E
40|$|Managing {{the costs}} of {{supplies}} within healthcare facilities has been a task that has plagued the health industry for many years. Many facilities are accustomed to using a par system approach. This involves bringing an inventory item to an amount sufficient for daily operation. This method often requires daily inspection by a healthcare worker, which reduces his/her time spent performing value added tasks. Employees at small healthcare facilities have multiple responsibilities, therefore they cannot afford to spend much time on inventory management. A proposed approach is the Kanban method, which allows for strict monitoring of inventory items without the need of constant inspection. Items are organized according to the ABC classification system, with B and C items complying by a special case of the Kanban method, the two <b>bin</b> <b>system.</b> To implement such a system, healthcare employees must undergo training of inventory management principles. This educational training is a major component that allows employees to effectively sustain the inventory management system, as well as reproduce it across other residences on their campus. The purpose of this thesis was to develop an inventory management system for a small healthcare facility that is sustainable and transferrable...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) is a {{challenging}} problem for developing countries. Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generation in Chennai, {{the fourth largest}} metropolitan city in India, has increased from 600 to 3500 tons per day (tpd) within 20 years. The highest per capita solid waste generation rate in India is in Chennai (0. 6 kg/d). Chennai is divided into 10 zones of 155 wards and collection of garbage is carried out using door-to-door collection and street <b>bin</b> <b>systems.</b> The collected wastes are disposed at open dump sites located {{at a distance of}} 15 km from the city. Recent investigations on reclamation and hazard potential of the sites indicate the need for the rehabilitation of the sites. Chennai is the first city in India to contract out MSWM services to a foreign private agency- ONYX, a Singapore based company. The scope of privatization includes activities such as sweeping, collection, storing, transporting of MSW and creating public awareness in three municipal zones. ONYX collects about 1100 Metric tons of waste from three zones per day and transports it to open dumps. Various Community Based Organizations (CBO) are also involved in the MSWM of the city. A high rate biomethanation plant for power generation is in operation at the Koyembedu market. Total cost for street sweeping, collection and transportation per Metric ton of waste by Corporation of Chennai (CoC) and Onyx is approximately USD 33 and 25, respectively. 1...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims. The Doryctinae is a {{considerably}} diverse, poorly studied group of parasitoid wasps {{and one of}} the most diverse subfamilies within Braconidae. Taxonomic knowledge of this group remains highly incomplete, specially in the tropics. In Mexico, it has been reported as the subfamily with the highest number of recorded genera. A preliminary Barcoding study carried out in the Chamela region, located near the Mexican pacific coast in Jalisco, identified 185 barcoding species of Dorytinae assigned to 19 identified doryctine genera. This work updates the later study, representing a three years effort to assess the species richness of this subfamily for the Chamela region. Materials and methods. Ten collecting field trips of 5 to 10 days each were carried out from June 2009 to May 2011. A 2 % divergence criterion using the <b>BIN</b> <b>system</b> implemented in BOLD was followed in order to establish species boundaries among the specimens that were collected. © Gutiérrez-Arellano D et al.

40|$|Although thrips are {{globally}} important crop {{pests and}} vectors of viral disease, species identifications are {{difficult because of}} their small size and inconspicuous morphological differences. Sequence variation in the mitochondrial COI- 5 ' (DNA barcode) region has proven effective for the identification of species in many groups of insect pests. We analyzed barcode sequence variation among 471 thrips from various plant hosts in north-central Pakistan. The Barcode Index Number (<b>BIN)</b> <b>system</b> assigned these sequences to 55 BINs, while the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery detected 56 partitions, a count that coincided {{with the number of}} monophyletic lineages recognized by Neighbor-Joining analysis and Bayesian inference. Congeneric species showed an average of 19 % sequence divergence (range = 5. 6 % - 27 %) at COI, while intraspecific distances averaged 0. 6 % (range = 0. 0 % - 7. 6 %). BIN analysis suggested that all intraspecific divergence > 3. 0 % actually involved a species complex. In fact, sequences for three major pest species (Haplothrips reuteri, Thrips palmi, Thrips tabaci), and one predatory thrips (Aeolothrips intermedius) showed deep intraspecific divergences, providing evidence that each is a cryptic species complex. The study compiles the first barcode reference library for the thrips of Pakistan, and examines global haplotype diversity in four important pest thrips...|$|E
40|$|Although {{members of}} the crambid {{subfamily}} Pyraustinae are frequently important crop pests, their identification is often difficult because many species lack conspicuous diagnostic morphological characters. DNA barcoding employs sequence diversity in a short standardized gene region to facilitate specimen identifications and species discovery. This study provides a DNA barcode reference library for North American pyraustines based upon the analysis of 1589 sequences recovered from 137 nominal species, 87 % of the fauna. Data from 125 species were barcode compliant (> 500 bp, < 1 % n), and 99 of these taxa formed a distinct cluster that was assigned to a single BIN. The other 26 species were assigned to 56 BINs, reflecting frequent cases of deep intraspecific sequence divergence and a few instances of barcode sharing, creating a total of 155 BINs. Two systems for OTU designation, ABGD and BIN, were examined to check the correspondence between current taxonomy and sequence clusters. The <b>BIN</b> <b>system</b> performed better than ABGD in delimiting closely related species, while OTU counts with ABGD were influenced by the value employed for relative gap width. Different species with low or no interspecific divergence may represent cases of unrecognized synonymy, whereas those with high intraspecific divergence require further taxonomic scrutiny as they may involve cryptic diversity. The barcode library developed in this study will also help to advance understanding of relationships among species of Pyraustinae...|$|E
50|$|Two {{generations of}} the Revopak were {{produced}} - the early 1971-1973 models used hydraulic motors which drove the compaction rake by means of chains, while the later models utilised a simpler and more robust drive system which consisted of twin synchronised hydraulic rams to operate the compaction system. Many variations were made of the basic design, including a multitude of different body lengths and payloads, plus SD developed bin lifters as an optional extra - a precursor to the modern wheeled <b>bin</b> collection <b>systems</b> of today. One disadvantage of the system was heavier fuel consumption, since the compaction system has to run continuously {{in order to be}} effective.|$|R

40|$|Simple {{improvements}} in C-band weather {{radar data processing}} are performed based on radar polarimetry. The starting point is the estimation of the differential propagation phase FiDP from the measured total differential phase ??DP. The main topics are (ground) clutter removal and quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE). For the former, a new test which checks some polarimetric quantities is added (as a trial) in a pre-existing clutter/non-clutter <b>bin</b> classification <b>system.</b> For the latter, three â€˜state-of-the-art' ??DP-based precipitation attenuation correction procedures are considered to correct ZH for precipitation attenuation.
