5|$|In early 2011, the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC), and the NYC & Company water travel {{initiative}} NYHarborWay, {{worked with}} the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) to release a Comprehensive Citywide Ferry Study, in which it examined over 40 potential locations for a ferry system in New York City. The study was commissioned {{in order to examine}} transport alternatives for neighborhoods along New York City's shores. It also discussed the East River Ferry, which was set to enter service later that year. The study identified potential ferry routes to western Manhattan and Riverdale; eastern Manhattan, the South Bronx, and Co-op City; the northern <b>Brooklyn</b> <b>and</b> Queens shorelines; the South Shore of Staten Island; and southwestern Brooklyn, southern <b>Brooklyn,</b> <b>and</b> the Rockaways.|$|E

5|$|Over {{time the}} synagogue appealed {{to a broader}} {{constituency}} than just Roumanian-American Jews. Nevertheless, membership declined during {{the latter half of}} the 20th century as the upwardly mobile Jewish population of the Lower East Side moved to north Manhattan, <b>Brooklyn,</b> <b>and</b> the Bronx.

5|$|The former Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) also {{planned a}} {{railroad}} tunnel, for freight use, between <b>Brooklyn</b> <b>and</b> Staten Island in 1893. The PRR also proposed a tunnel from Brooklyn to Jersey City, approximately following the planned {{path of the}} Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel, ten years later.

5|$|This is {{the only}} subway station serving the island of Broad Channel, which is located in Jamaica Bay. The island only has about 3,000 residents, and as a result, this is the least-used station in the subway system not {{counting}} the closed Cortlandt Street station. However, this station serves an important role. It is the transfer point between the Rockaway Park Shuttle, which runs to Rockaway Park–Beach 116th Street, and the A train, which runs through <b>Brooklyn</b> <b>and</b> Manhattan.|$|E

5|$|A {{rapid transit}} route to connect Staten Island (alternately known as Richmond County) to the {{remainder}} of New York City was proposed in 1912, {{in conjunction with the}} Dual Contracts of the New York City Subway. At the time, there were no vehicular or rail connections between Staten Island and the other four boroughs; the only connection was by ferry. Although not funded by the city, the tunnel was expected to help expand the then-sparsely populated borough in a similar manner to the population and development explosions seen in <b>Brooklyn</b> <b>and</b> the Bronx.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{also worked}} {{occasionally}} as an umpire in significant games. One notable example {{was the final}} contest of a three-game series between all-star teams from <b>Brooklyn</b> <b>and</b> New York City, held on September 10, 1858, in Long Island. During the game, which the New York City all-stars won 29–18, Adams became the first umpire to use a new rule allowing for a strike to be called against a batter who did not swing at a pitch in the strike zone. Previously, strikes were only called when a batter swung at a pitch and missed. Three batters were ruled out on strikes called by Adams in the game. Otherwise, the called strike rule was not applied often in its {{first few years of}} existence.|$|E

In San Francisco they played two matches against British Columbia; the first won 43–6 and the second 65–6. From there they sailed back to New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|As news spread, {{other banks}} and trust {{companies}} {{were reluctant to}} lend any money.

The panic quickly spread to two other large trusts, Trust Company of America and Lincoln Trust Company. By Thursday, October 24, a chain of failures littered the street: Twelfth Ward Bank, Empire City Savings Bank, Hamilton Bank of New York, First National Bank of Brooklyn, International Trust Company of New York, Williamsburg Trust Company of Brooklyn, Borough Bank of Brooklyn, Jenkins Trust Company of <b>Brooklyn</b> <b>and</b> the Union Trust Company of Providence.|$|E
5|$|Chesbro {{met with}} Highlanders owner Frank J. Farrell and new manager Harry Wolverton in February 1912 about {{attempting}} a comeback.

Chesbro's request for reinstatement {{as a free agent}} was granted in March, while the Highlanders granted him his unconditional release. Chesbro decided to travel to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where teams participated in spring training, in an attempt to find a team willing to give him a chance at a comeback. He worked out with <b>Brooklyn</b> <b>and</b> Pittsburgh, but both teams passed on him.|$|E
