40|$|Entrepreneurship inclinations among <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fisher's Associations {{have been}} found to be a crucial issue for further investigation. A {{structured}} questionnaire was developed by reviewing the literatures and data gathered through in-depth interviews with <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fisher's Associations. Correlation analysis has been employed to examine the hypotheses. The study demonstrates that monthly income and educational level have an influence on entrepreneurial inclinations among <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fisher's Association. The study revealed that entrepreneurial inclinations among <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fisher's Associations were low. This was due to <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> fishers' job (work status), which required them to go fishing in the sea. The study recommends that measures should be taken for less dependency on general manager as well as enhancing capacity building activities for <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> association...|$|R
