The prize is ownership of Spiral Mountain, while the loser must endure eternal hardship at L.O.G.'s video game factory. As Banjo and Kazooie seek {{to win by}} completing the challenges, Gruntilda uses her powers and abilities {{to try to stop}} the duo, with a cat named Piddles and an army of robots assisting her. The game ends with Gruntilda and Banjo participating in a final duel in Spiral Mountain.

Meanwhile, Gruntilda declares that bringing her to the factory was a mistake and vows that she will make her own video game.|$|E

He offered her money, and asked her {{to leave the}}ir two children behind. But Kuveni took the children along with her to the Yakkha city of Lankapura. She asked her children to stay <b>back,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> entered the city, where other Yakkhas recognized her as a traitor. She was suspected of being a spy, and killed by a Yakkha. On advice of her maternal uncle, the children fled to Sumanakuta (identified with Adam's Peak). In the Malaya region of Lanka, they became husband-wife and gave rise to the Pulinda race (identified with the Vedda people; {{not to be confused with}} the Pulindas of India).|$|E
25|$|On 28 February 1941, Persier was {{battered}} by a storm, with a hatch cover being ripped {{off and the}} steering and electrical systems failing. She was stranded east off Vik in Myrdalur, Iceland and was severely damaged. Persier was refloated in April, and towed to Reykjavík by the tug Aegir for initial repairs to be made. On 9 June, Persier {{was taken to the}} Kleppsvik Strand, but broke her <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was insufficiently supported, and was subsequently beached. On 8 February 1942, she was refloated and re-beached, finally being refloated on 20 May. She was towed by the tugs Empire Bascobel and Empire Larch to a Tyneside shipyard for repairs, which were completed in February 1943. Persiers first voyage on return to service was from Liverpool to New York, United States as a member of Convoy ON 169. Departing on 22 February, the convoy arrived on 21 March. In September 1943, Persier was a member of Convoy SC 141, which departed Halifax, Nova Scotia on 3 September, and arrived at Liverpool on 17 September.

25|$|Gray started {{shooting}} indiscriminately, targeting a utility vehicle full of locals {{who had seen}} the Holden house burning and stopped to help. He first shot Vanessa Percy {{several times in the}} <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> ran down the street in terror; she died a few hours later at the scene. He then turned to the three children. He killed the two boys, Leo Wilson and Dion Percy. The boys' sister, Stacey, was critically injured by a bullet to her abdomen, but survived. Ross Percy, the children's father, who had been driving them home after a day fishing when they saw the fire, was fatally shot in the head. Next, Aleki Tali was killed. Gray then entered the home of Tim Jamieson, killing him and another elderly local, former Green Island mayor Vic Crimp. The next victim was James Dickson, who was looking for his dog. Eva Helen Dickson, James' mother, and neighbour Chris Cole went into the road to see what the noise was. Gray shot at both of them, wounding Cole who was in a phone booth calling the police and forcing Mrs Dickson to dive for cover. Mrs Dickson, who had recently had a hip replacement and was unable to walk without assistance, pulled herself along on her stomach using her arms and feet in a ditch to get inside and called 1-1-1 (emergency telephone number). She then crawled back to Cole to tell him help was coming. By this stage, it was getting dark and the dispatcher advised her to stay inside. Mrs Dickson later received the George Medal for bravery. Help arrived too late for Cole, who died in the hospital.|$|E
500|$|Shakur {{testified that}} Trooper Harper shot her after {{she raised her}} arms to comply with his demand.

500|$|Faye and Joseph became {{engaged in}} series ten, much to Jac's displeasure. Roberts has relayed Marcel's insight that, [...] "Jac's left with very little.

[...] He added, on Joseph's reaction to Jac's meddling in his relationship with Faye; [...] "He's a good guy but Jac brings out the evil in him. He does have a darker side. He will fight injustice with injustice." [...] In the episode [...] "Locked Away", Joseph and Jac are locked in theatre together– after being affected by an unknown poison– where they both reveal their true feelings for each other. Joseph admits that he still loves Jac, but would not take her <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> has hurt him too many times.|$|E
500|$|In {{the role}} of belly dancer, Steinberg engaged in {{dramatic}} interaction with Bono, especially upon entrance and exit from the stage. At times Bono would sing to the belly dancer's image on the giant video screens around the stage. During the tour, Steinberg changed the colours of her outfit to match certain occasions, such as wearing orange and black around Halloween. Steinberg was originally reluctant to put her own activities on hold to continue on to the [...] "Zooropa" [...] leg of the tour, but eventually agreed. Unlike others in the tour entourage, Steinberg exhibited a professional independence from the group and did not wait on their whims. In 1993, while still on tour, Steinberg appeared in U2's Kevin Godley-directed music video for their single [...] "Numb", first with her feet {{as part of the}} video's assault on The Edge and then with her <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> belly danced.|$|E

Reviewer William Ruhlmann found Sweet Sixteen to [...] "double back to a formula that worked {{for her in the}} past".

Cyrus and several backup dancers began the performance on the upper level of the stage, where they proceeded down a ramp as they perform dance routines. Cyrus and the backup dancers roamed throughout the stage {{for the remainder of the}} performance. Jane Stevenson of the Canadian Online Explorer listed [...] "See You Again" [...] as one of the highlights at the concert at Air Canada Centre on December 15, 2007, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. She said that Cyrus' wardrobe indicated that [...] "Miley, it turns out, is the marginally tougher cookie of the two singers." ...|$|E
500|$|Amy wakes on 26 June 2010 in {{her home}} to {{discover}} that her parents have been brought back into existence and she and Rory celebrate their wedding day. At the reception, River leaves her blank diary for Amy which prompts Amy to recall the Doctor and something he told {{her when she was}} seven during his rewind. She interrupts her father's speech, imploring the [...] "Raggedy" [...] Doctor from her memories to come <b>back.</b> <b>As</b> <b>she</b> recites the old wedding proverb ("something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue"), relating that to what the Doctor had said about the TARDIS, the TARDIS and the Doctor appear. The Doctor comes out of the TARDIS and after a brief conversation with Amy, introduces himself by saying [...] "Hello everyone! I'm Amy's imaginary friend, but I came anyway!" [...] and joins the wedding festivities. Afterwards, he returns River's diary and the vortex manipulator to her so she can return to her own time. She sadly tells him he will soon learn who she truly is and that it will change everything. Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor explains to Amy and Rory that unanswered questions remain about the destruction of the TARDIS and the nature of [...] "the silence" [...] that will fall. The Doctor receives a telephone call alerting him to the presence of [...] "an escaped Egyptian goddess on the Orient Express, in space". He tells them that this will have to be goodbye. They agree that it is goodbye and Amy leans out of the TARDIS and yells [...] "Goodbye!". The three then leave on their next adventure.|$|E

During the climax of the song Minaj is still in the jungle this time with a green wig were dancing in the mud and comes out of the water, crawling through the forest.
