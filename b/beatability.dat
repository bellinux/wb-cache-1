40|$|A linear {{correlation}} {{has been found}} between the <b>beatability</b> and the hemicellulose content of Scandinavian softwood laboratory pulps. In addition to increasing yield, especially of hemicellulose, additives like polysulfide and/or anthraquinone can thus improve the <b>beatability</b> of softwood pulps. At similar hemicellulose content, pulps manufactured from Norway spruce (Picea abies) is still better than pulps manufactured from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). By measuring fibre width using the STFI Fibermaster, <b>beatability</b> correlated well with a parameter incorporating hemicellulose content and fibre width. The <b>beatability</b> of Scandinavian softwood pulps can thus be modelled irrespective of raw material...|$|E
40|$|The beating {{behaviour}} of the chlorite and {{peracetic acid}} pulps prepared from beech (temperate hardwood), red pine (temperate softwood), and red lauan (tropical hardwood) was studied. The {{differences in the}} <b>beatability</b> of those pulps lie in the differences amongst fiber morphology of wood species and amongst holopulping conditions. An excess oxidative delignification or a sulfuric acid treatment can improve the pulp <b>beatability.</b> The removal of hemicelluloses and the structural modifications of the external and internal surfaces of the pulp fibers take place simultaneously in those chemical treatments. It is shown that the variation of pulp <b>beatability</b> depends on the structural modifications of pulp fibers {{rather than on the}} quantity of lignin or hemicelluloses or on the kind of hemicelluloses. A decrease in the degree of polymerization of the hemicelluloses can also affect the <b>beatability</b> of pulp fibers. It is inferred that the positive influence on pulp <b>beatability</b> should be attributed to the regions of structural modifications existing in the outside and inside of pulp fibers, which facilitate further their swelling and fibrillation. The presence of hemicelluloses in those regions is preferable for the amelioration of pulp <b>beatability.</b> The action of the excess oxidative delignification and the sulfuric acid treatment is like that of a prebeating process. A new method based on the rate of evaporation of acetone sorbed by pulp fibers has been developed to estimate the internal surface of pulp fibers...|$|E
40|$|The factors {{contributing}} to the differences between chlorine dioxide and hydrogen peroxide final ECF bleaching stages are discussed {{with respect to the}} properties of Eucalyptus globulus kraft pulps. The higher <b>beatability</b> of pulps bleached with a final peroxide stage was assigned to the better fibre swelling capacity. For laboratory beaten fibres, dry zero-span tensile strength is a more suitable predictor of fibre strength than wet zero-span or intrinsic viscosity, at least when comparing pulps with different bleaching history.

40|$|Effects of enzyme {{pretreatment}} on {{the properties}} of fast-growing poplar APMP pulp were evaluated. Compared with the unpretreated pulp, the <b>beatabilities</b> of the pulp that had been pretreated by enzymes were improved significantly, such as a decrease of Canadian Standard Freeness (CSF) {{in the range of}} 25 mL to 55 mL, a decrease of PFI mill revolutions from 1000 r to 5500 r, and a decrease of beating energy consumption from 12. 5 % to 22. 0 %. The values of brightness, breaking length, tearing index, bursting index, and folding number of the pulp pretreated by cellulase were improved by 1. 2 %ISO, 23. 7 %, 14. 8 %, 14. 6 %, and 50 % respectively, while that of the pulp pretreated by xylanase were respectively improved by 2. 1 %ISO, 16. 8 %, 8. 8 %, 8. 9 %, and 25 %. The optimal enzyme dosages were 25 IU•g- 1 and 25 IU•g- 1 for cellulase and xylanase, respectively. Fibre quality analysis results showed that the fibre length of pretreated pulp increased partly, fibre width and fines content decreased, fibres torsion increased, and fibre bonding got stronger. X-ray diffractometer analysis indicated that the degree of crystallinity of fibres increased after the enzyme pretreatment...|$|R

Endoglucanase enzyme with different dosages including 1 u, 2 u and 3 u (on oven dry based pulp) {{at different times of}} 0. 5, 1, 1. 5 and 2 hours under constant process conditions added to OCC pulp in two states namely refined and unrefined. Treated pulps under different conditions were evaluated at the point of <b>beatability</b> and drainage rates. The results showed that addition of enzyme caused to improve (confidence level of 95 %) freeness and drainage rate, compared to control sample but improvement of freeness with increasing of endoglucanase dosages was not observed significantly. The results of the effect of different enzyme levels at different refining levels was shown that addition of different enzyme dosages to pulps refined at different levels, caused to improve freeness and drainage rate. With increasing the degree of pulps refining (higher levels of refining), the effect of enzyme concentration was observed a little to improve freeness and drainage rate. Also in total refining levels, longer treatment by enzyme from up to 1 hours (using optimum dosage 1 u) was led a significant effect on increasing the freeness while there was not a significant decrease of freeness at longer times than 1 hour...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the <b>beatability</b> of soda and {{monoethanolamine}} pulps was compared. The refining of pulps {{was done in}} pilot scale Voith refiner Model LR 40. The {{results show that the}} maximum tensile and burst indices of monothanolamine pulp are reached with consumption of 70 kWh energy in pilot scale Voith refiner and the increasing of energy more than this level has the adverse effect on these indices. In the case of soda pulp increasing the energy up to 500 kWh has the linear relationship with tensile and burst indices. In comparison to monoethanolamine pulp, the refining of soda pulp is more difficult and needs more energy. Using monoethanolamine pulp resulted in saving of energy by 70 - 80 % to reach the optimum strength indices...|$|E
40|$|Xylans are polysaccharides {{present in}} large amounts in cell walls of {{vascular}} plants. They possess an inherent affinity to cellulose and will thus adsorb irreversibly on cellulose surfaces. This propensity, {{along with the}} great abundance in nature, provides great opportunities {{for the use of}} xylans as renewable and biodegradable cellulose fibre modifying agents. The research presented in this thesis provides further knowledge of how the composition of xylan fractions influences solution properties and characteristics of xylan adsorption on cellulosic fibres. The study also describes how xylan adsorption can be used to improve the strength properties of bleached softwood kraft pulp. Furthermore, the work investigates the potential of utilizing xylan isolated from agricultural waste materials in cellulose fibre modification. Results show that lignin has a great influence on the aggregation behaviour of glucuronoxylan (GX) from birch. As lignin affects the solubility of xylan, it most likely also influences the driving force for xylan adsorption and deposition on cellulosic surfaces. Adsorption of GX on bleached softwood kraft pulp before drying is shown to preserve a considerable part of the fibre-swelling, fibre wall porosity, specific fibre surface area and wet fibre flexibility observed in the never-dried state. It is therefore suggested that GX adsorption reduces the degree of drying-induced fibre wall cross-linking. The use of GX as a hornification inhibitor provides once-dried fibres with increased tensile strength and <b>beatability.</b> Water-soluble (glucurono) arabinoxylan (GAX) isolated from barley husks is shown to interact with cellulose fibres. GAX with a low degree of substitution has an enhanced propensity to form aggregates in aqueous solutions and adsorb on cellulosic surfaces. In order to increase the driving force of adsorption of the more highly substituted xylan, GAX was cationized. This chemical modification increases the rate and magnitude of GAX adsorption extensively, due to the induced electrostatic interaction between anionic pulp fibres and cationic xylan. Furthermore, it is shown that adsorption of GAX on never-dried fibres may be beneficial in the production of market pulps with increased tensile strength and <b>beatability...</b>|$|E
40|$|Xylan {{is known}} to adsorb irreversibly on {{cellulose}} and on bleached kraft pulp fibres. This investigation shows that adsorption of birch glucuronoxylan (GX) reduces the degree of drying-induced property changes of bleached softwood kraft pulp fibres. GX was adsorbed at different amounts on never-dried fibres, which provided pulps with xylan contents ranging from 67 to 126 mg/g. By fluorescent labelling of the GX, followed by adsorption and subsequent imaging using confocal laser scanning microscopy, {{it was concluded that}} GX adsorbs on fibril surfaces throughout the fibre wall with enrichment on the outer fibre surface. Adsorption of GX before drying preserved a considerable part of the fibre-swelling (water retention value and fibre saturation point), specific fibre surface area, and wet fibre flexibility observed in the never-dried state.

40|$|It has earlier {{been shown}} that the counter-ion to the charged groups in the fibre has a {{significant}} effect on the <b>beatability</b> of fibres, but large-scale investigations of this effect are scarce in the literature. The objectives of the present study were therefore to develop a technique to ion-exchange large quantities of industrial pulp into the Na+-form using complexing agents and to study the effect of industrial-scale refining on pulp fibres in the Na+-form and how the fibres respond to industrial-like papermaking. The results show that ion-exchange can indeed be conducted on a pilot-scale using complexing agents such as DTPA. The study further indicates that an energy reduction of 50 % at a given WRV or tensile index may be achieved if the fibres are converted to Na+-form prior to pilot-scale refining. By applying these techniques in full-scale production, it should thus be possible to save significant amount of energy, {{especially in the case of}} papers made from unbleached pulp that usually demands a higher degree of beating to achieve sufficient strength...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the impact of {{cellulose}} depolymerisation on the beating potential and handsheet properties of the portuguese E. globulus kraft pulp. A homogeneous sample of eucalypt wood chips was cooked using different kraft pulping conditions (cooking temperatures and times, and sodium hydroxide and sodium sulphide concentrations) {{in order to obtain}} a wide variation for intrinsic viscosity of the pulps. In the range of industrial cooking conditions, this property was found to be linearly dependent on the effective alkali charge, for a given cooking time and temperature. Unbeaten and beaten (at 2000 rev. PFI) pulp properties were evaluated and the results confirm that the higher the pulp intrinsic viscosity the better the pulp <b>beatability</b> and the paper properties. However, the differences in the latter cannot be exclusively explained by the differences in viscosity, since pulps with the same viscosity may exhibit distinct papermaking potentials. It was then necessary to scan other pulp chemical characteristics that could also influence the development of paper properties such as lignin, pentosan content and polysaccharides relative composition.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, it was {{evaluated}} how two different culture {{conditions for the}} biotreatment of Eucalyptus grandis by Ceriporiopsis subvermispora affect a subsequent high-yield kraft pulping process. Under the varied culture conditions investigated, different extracellular enzyme activities were observed. Manganese-peroxidase (MnP) secretion was 3. 7 times higher in cultures supplemented with glucose plus corn-steep liquor (glucose/CSL) as compared to non-supplemented (NS) cultures. The biotreated samples underwent diverse levels of wood component degradation as losses of weight and lignin were increased in glucose/CSL cultures. Mass balances for lignin removal during kraft pulping showed that delignification was facilitated when both biotreated wood samples were cooked. Delignification efficiency did not correlate positively with MnP levels in the cultures. On the other hand, biopulps from NS and glucose/CSL cultures saved 27 % and 38 % beating time to achieve 288 Schopper-Riegler freeness during refining, respectively. Biopulps disposed of decreased tensile and tear resistances, thus easier refining of the biokraft pulps {{seems to be a}} consequence of less resistant fiber walls. Improved <b>beatability</b> of biopulps was tentatively related to short fibers and fines formation during refining. We suggest that to some extent polysaccharide depolymerization occurred during the biotreatment, which also resulted in diminished pulp yields in the case of glucose/CSL cultures.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{characterize}} chemically and morphologically elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum), and evaluate the potential of its fibers for production of printing and writing paper grade pulp. The elephant grass was chemically and morphologically characterized and cooked by the soda process to two different degrees of delignification (kappa 17. 5 and 10. 6). The resulting pulps were fully bleached by the O-D*-(EP) -D sequence and characterized for their <b>beatability,</b> drainability and physical-mechanical properties. The lignin content (20. 2 %) was low, indicating that this grass should be easier to pulp. The morphological analyses of the elephant grass indicated a short fiber material, similar to hardwoods. The soda pulp from elephant grass cooked to kappa number 17. 5 presented higher screened yield than 10. 6 kappa pulp, with alkali demands of 15. 0 % and 20. 0 %, respectively. The total active chlorine required by the 17. 5 and 10. 6 kappa pulps, were 42. 1 and 35. 1 kg/odt pulp, respectively, to achieve an ISO brightness of approximately 90. 0 %. The bleached soda pulps cooked to 17. 5 and 10. 6 kappa number showed similar refinability and resistance to drainage, but the tensile and burst index were highest for the 17. 5 kappa pulp at beating energy consumptions in the range of 0 - 6 Wh. It was concluded that both 10. 6 and 17. 5 kappa pulps from elephant grass are suitable for the production of printing and writing paper grade pulps, but the highest kappa 17. 5 pulp is more economically attractive given its highest pulping yield, despite the significantly increased of chemical demand for bleaching A produção de papel para impressão e escrita Grau de celulose a partir de capim-elefante...|$|E
40|$|Hemicelluloses are, {{together}} with cellulose and pectins, the polysaccharide constituents {{in the cell}} walls of higher plants. Xylans {{are the most common}} hemicelluloses, and are considered to be the second most abundant biopolymer in the plant kingdom. Xylans have an inherent affinity to cellulose and will thus adsorb on cellulose surfaces; a propensity providing great opportunities for modification of cellulose fibres. The molecular structure of xylan is proposed to affect the solubility and the level of cellulose interaction. This thesis investigates the influence of xylan composition on solution properties in aqueous systems, and its effect on cellulose fibre adsorption. In addition, the effects of xylan adsorption on softwood pulp properties and the possibility of utilising xylans from agricultural residues, i. e. barley husks, in cellulose fibre modification are studied. Lignin has been shown to have a great influence on the self-assembly behaviour of birch xylan. It is proposed that the agglomeration starts with the nucleation of lignin polymer molecules that are complexed with water-soluble lignin-containing xylan molecules via secondary bonds. As lignin affects the solubility of xylan, it most probably also influences the driving force for xylan accumulation and adsorption on cellulose surfaces. Xylans isolated from barley husks have been shown to interact with cellulose. Temperature and initial concentration of xylan {{has been shown to be}} important parameters in controlling the level of adsorption on cellulose fibres, but the adsorption appears to be largely dependent on xylan molecular structure. Arabinoxylans with a low degree of substitution have an enhanced capacity to interact with each other and with other polysaccharides; a feature that explains the observed propensity of low substituted xylan to form agglomerated structures and adsorb on cellulose surfaces. Furthermore, barley husk xylan has shown great potential as a dry strengthening agent for bleached once-dried softwood pulp. Adsorption of birch xylan on never-dried bleached softwood kraft pulp has been shown to improve tensile strength and <b>beatability,</b> but tensile strength at a given °SR, density and light scattering coefficient is more or less unaffected. The effects are more pronounced for once-dried pulp than for never-dried pulp. It is hypothesised that adsorbed xylan has a stabilising effect on cellulose fibrils, preventing aggregation upon drying, and thus reducing the effect of hornification...|$|E
40|$|Studies on {{strength}} {{delivery and}} related fields {{have so far}} concentrated on finding the locations in the mill where fibres are damaged and what the damages consist of. However, fibres will invariably encounter mechanical stresses along the fibreline and in this thesis a new concept is introduced; the vulnerability of fibres to mechanical treatment. It is hypothesised that fibres with different properties have different abilities to withstand the mechanical forces they endure as they are discharged from the digester and transported through valves, pumps and various washing and bleaching equipment. In the thesis, results are presented from trials where pulps with significantly different hemicellulose compositions were high-intensity mixed at pH 13, 70 °C and 10 % pulp consistency and pulp strength evaluated. By varying alkalinity and temperature, pulps with different carbohydrate composition could be obtained. High alkali concentration and low temperature resulted in high glucomannan content and low xylan content, whereas cooking at low alkali concentration and high temperature rendered a pulp with low glucomannan and high xylan content. The high alkalinity pulp was stronger, determined as tear index at given tensile index. The pulp viscosity was also higher for this pulp. However, when the pulps were subjected to high-intensity mixing, the high alkalinity pulp lost in tear strength and the re-wetted zero-span tensile strength was substantially reduced. The pulp cooked at high alkalinity was thus interpreted as being more vulnerable to mechanical treatment than the pulp obtained by cooking at low alkalinity. Another pair of pulps was manufactured at high and low sodium ion concentrations, but otherwise with similar chemical charges. The pulp obtained by cooking at low sodium ion concentration became stronger, evaluated as tear index at a given tensile index and the curl index was substantially lower, 8 % compared to 12 % for the pulp cooked at a high sodium ion concentration. The viscosity was 170 ml/g higher for the pulp manufactured at low sodium ion concentration. When the pulps were subjected to high-intensity mixing, the tear strength of the pulp manufactured at high sodium ion concentration was reduced. The re-wetted zero-span tensile index decreased also after mixing. The pulp obtained by cooking at higher sodium ion concentration was thus interpreted as being more vulnerable to mechanical treatment than the pulp manufactured at lower sodium ion concentration. In the thesis, two reasons for the low strength delivery of industrially produced pulps compared to laboratory-cooked pulps are put forward. Since the ionic strength of mill cooking liquor systems {{is much higher than}} is normally used in laboratory cooking, this can partly explain the difference in strength between mill- and laboratory-cooked pulp. A higher sodium ion concentration was shown in this thesis work to give a pulp of lower strength. Secondly, it is suggested that the difference in retention time of the black liquor in laboratory cooking and continuous mill cooking systems can explain the difference in tensile strength between laboratory-cooked and mill-produced pulp. The black liquor in a continuous digester has a longer retention time in the digester than the chips. This gives a longer time for the dissolved xylan to degrade and, as a consequence, the xylan deposited on the mill pulp fibres will be more degraded than the xylan deposited on the laboratory-cooked pulp fibres. In the thesis, results are also presented from studies using different strength-enhancing chemicals. The fibre surfaces of bleached never-dried and once-dried pulp were modified by the polyelectrolyte multilayer technique using cationic and anionic starch. Although the pulps absorbed the same amount of starch, the never-dried pulp reached a higher tensile index than the once-dried pulp. When the starch-treated never-dried pulp was dried and reslushed it still had higher tensile index than the never-dried untreated pulp. The starch layers were thus able to counteract part of the hornification effect. The never-dried starch treated pulps were subsequently dried, reslushed and beaten. Pulp with starch layers had a better <b>beatability</b> evaluated as the tensile index obtained after given number of PFI revolutions than dried untreated pulp. Hence, there is a potential to increase the tensile index of market pulp by utilising the polyelectrolyte multilayer technique before drying. Addition of CMC to bleached mill pulp and laboratory-cooked pulp increased the tensile strength to the same degree for both pulps. CMC addition had a straightening effect on the fibres, the shape factor increased and this increased the zero-span tensile strength also. QC 2010051...|$|E
