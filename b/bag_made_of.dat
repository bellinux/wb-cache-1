On his feet were placed clogs, or wooden shoes, and he was then put into the poena cullei, a sack made of ox-leather. Placed along with him into the sack was also an {{assortment}} of live animals, arguably the most famous combination being that of a serpent, a cock, a monkey and a dog. The sack was put on a cart, and the cart driven by black oxen to a running stream or to the sea. Then, the sack with its inhabitants was thrown into the water.|$|E

Only three of them produced any pods, each a single one; and these three pods contained one, four, and five seeds. So that only a single pod from the seven racemes included a fair complement of seeds.|$|E

60|$|Louis Blanc superintended {{the making}} of this pemmican, which {{consisted}} of fish dried {{in the sun and}} pounded between two stones. Pemmican is also made of meat, in which case the pounded meat is put into a <b>bag</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> the raw hide of the animal; the bag is then filled with melted fat and the mouth sewed up with raw sinews. This style of pemmican will keep fresh for years.|$|E
60|$|So {{saying he}} pulled out a silver cup, and filling it with water from a gourd which stood by the bedside, he next drew forth a small silken <b>bag</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> network, twisted with silver, the {{contents}} of which the bystanders could not discover, and immersing it in the cup, continued to watch it in silence during the space of five minutes. It seemed to the spectators as if some effervescence took place during the operation; but if so, it instantly subsided.|$|E

60|$|One {{morning the}} Rev. George Lind {{received}} a letter addressed in a handwriting {{which he did not}} remember and never thenceforth forgot. Within the envelope he found a dainty little <b>bag</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> blue satin, secured by ribbons of the same material. This contained a note written on scented paper, edged with gold, and decorated with a miniature representation of a pierrot, sitting cross-legged, conning a book, on the open pages of which appeared the letters L.V. The clergyman recognized the monogram no more than the writing. But as it was evidently from a lady, he felt a pleasant thrill of expectation as he unfolded the paper.|$|E
60|$|The {{standing}} {{figure was}} the first to speak. He was a grey-haired, broad-shouldered man, of the type which, in Tuscan phrase, is moulded with the fist and polished with the pickaxe; but the self-important gravity which had written itself out in the deep lines about his brow and mouth seemed intended to correct any contemptuous inferences from the hasty workmanship which Nature had bestowed on his exterior. He had deposited a large well-filled <b>bag,</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> skins, on the pavement, and before him hung a pedlar's basket, garnished partly with small woman's-ware, such as thread and pins, and partly with fragments of glass, which had probably been taken in exchange for those commodities.|$|E
60|$|The native, first {{placing a}} {{calabash}} beneath the nose, as it were, of his curious-looking log-steed, {{for the purpose}} of receiving the grated fragments as they fall, mounts astride of {{it as if it were}} a hobby-horse, and twirling the inside of one of his hemispheres of cocoa-nut around the sharp teeth of the mother-of-pearl shell, the pure white meat falls in snowy showers into the receptacle provided. Having obtained a quantity sufficient for his purpose, he places it in a <b>bag</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> the net-like fibrous substance attached to all cocoa-nut trees, and compressing it over the bread-fruit, which being now sufficiently pounded, is put into a wooden bowl—extracts a thick creamy milk. The delicious liquid soon bubbles round the fruit, and leaves it at last just peeping above its surface.|$|E

60|$|We {{all know}} how {{balloons}} are made, and this one of ours is like most others. It is a great globular <b>bag,</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> strips of silk sewn together, and varnished with a certain composition which renders the balloon air-tight. The car in which we will travel is made of wicker-work, for that is both light and strong, and it is suspended from a net-work of strong cord which covers the whole balloon. It would not do, you know, to attach a cord to any particular part of the silk, for that would tear it. In {{the top of the}} balloon is a valve, and a cord from it comes down into the car. This valve is to be pulled open when we wish to come down towards the earth. The gas then escapes, and of course the balloon descends. In the car are bags of sand, and these are to be emptied out when we think we are too heavy for the balloon, and are either coming down too fast or are not as high as we wish to go. Relieved of the weight of a bag, the balloon rises.|$|E
60|$|On the morrow {{there was}} a great to do about the place, for the black girl whose {{business}} it was to look after Suzanne came in at breakfast time and said that she had lost the child. It seemed that they had gone down to the shore in the early morning to gather big shells such as are washed up there after a heavy storm, and that Suzanne had taken with her a <b>bag</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> spring-buck hide in which to carry them. Well, the black girl sat down under the shadow of a rock, leaving Suzanne to wander to and fro looking for the shells, and not for an hour or more did she get up to find her. Then she searched in vain, for the spoor of the child's feet led from the sand between the rocks to the pebbly shore above, which was covered with tough sea grasses, and there was lost. Now at the girl's story I was frightened, and Jan was both frightened and so angry that he would have tied her up and flogged her if he had found time. But of this there was none to lose, so taking with him such Kaffirs as he could find he set off for the seashore to hunt for Suzanne. It was near sunset when he returned, and I, who was watching from the stoep, saw with a shiver of fear that he was alone.|$|E
6000|$|Pemmican, as {{made in the}} Prairie.--Mr. Ballantyne, who was in {{the service}} of the Hudson's Bay Company, gives the {{following}} account:--"Having shot a buffalo, the hunters cut lumps of his flesh, and slitting it up into flakes or layers, hang it up in the sun, or before a slow fire, to dry; and the fat can be dried as well as the lean. In this state, it is often made into packs, and sent about the country, to be consumed as dried meat (it is often best relished raw, for, when grilled without fat, it burns and becomes ashy); but when pemmican is wanted, it has to go through another process. When dry, the meat is pounded between two stones till it is broken into small pieces: these are put into a <b>bag</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> the animal's hide, with the hair on the outside, and well mixed with melted grease; the top of the bag is then sewn up, and the pemmican allowed to cool. In this state it may be eaten uncooked; but the men who subsist on it when travelling, mix it with a little flour and water, and then boil it--in which state it is know throughout the country by the elegant name of robbiboo. Pemmican is good wholesome food; will keep fresh for a great length of time; and, were it not for its unprepossessing appearance, and a good many buffalo hairs mixed with it, through the carelessness of the hunters, would be very palatable. After a time, however, one becomes accustomed to these little peculiarities." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{is made by}} the buffalo-hunters of the Red River, Swan River, and Saskatchewan prairies; more {{particularly}} by those of Red River, {{where many of the}} colonists spend a great part of the year in pursuit of the buffalo.

"Very well, sir," [...] said Job, [...] "it isn't {{my place}} to differ from you, sir, {{but if you}} happen to be going anywhere, sir, I should be obliged if you could manage to take me with you, seeing that I shall be glad to have a {{friendly}} face to look at when the time comes, just to help one through, as it were. And now, sir, I'll be getting the breakfast," [...] and he went, leaving me in a very uncomfortable state of mind. I was deeply attached to old Job, who was one of the best and honestest men I have ever had to do with in any class of life, and really more of a friend than a servant, and the mere idea of anything happening to him brought a lump into my throat. Beneath all his ludicrous talk I could see that he himself was quite convinced that something was going to happen, and though in most cases these convictions turn out to be utter moonshine--and this particular one especially was to be amply accounted for by the gloomy and unaccustomed surroundings in which its victim was placed--still it did more or less carry a chill to my heart, as any dread that is obviously a genuine object of belief is apt to do, however absurd the belief may be. Presently the breakfast arrived, and with it Leo, who had been taking a walk outside the cave--to clear his mind, he said--and very glad I was to see both, for they gave me a respite from my gloomy thoughts. After breakfast we went for another walk, and watched some of the Amahagger sowing a plot of ground with the grain from which they make their beer. This they did in scriptural fashion--a man with a <b>bag</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> goat's hide fastened round his waist walking up and down the plot and scattering the seed as he went. It was a positive relief to see one of these dreadful people do anything so homely and pleasant as sow a field, perhaps because it seemed to link them, as it were, with the rest of humanity.|$|E
