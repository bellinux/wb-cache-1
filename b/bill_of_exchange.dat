25|$|A fictional but illustrative example: a {{merchant}} is traveling from Florence to London. He buys a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> for 10 florins, {{with the understanding}} that the London branch will cash that bill at half a pound to the florin, for a total of 5 pounds. If he reaches London and discovers that the florin has become stronger against the pound, to the point where a florin buys a whole pound, he takes a loss: instead of the 10 pounds he could have gotten had he not bought the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange,</b> he will instead receive only 5. Similarly, if the florin weakens greatly, he could well reap a windfall {{at the expense of the}} London branch.|$|E

25|$|Later {{during the}} Mauryan period (321–185 BCE), an {{instrument}} called adesha was in use, {{which was an}} order on a banker directing him to pay the sum on the note to a third person, which corresponds {{to the definition of}} a modern <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> The considerable use of these instruments has been recorded. In large towns, merchants also gave letters of credit to one another.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 13th and early 14th centuries, a process took place– {{primarily}} in Italy but partly {{also in the}} Empire– that historians have termed a 'commercial revolution'. Among the innovations of the period were new forms of partnership and the issuing of insurance, both of which contributed to {{reducing the risk of}} commercial ventures; the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> and other forms of credit that circumvented the canonical laws for gentiles against usury, and eliminated the dangers of carrying bullion; and new forms of accounting, in particular double-entry bookkeeping, which allowed for better oversight and accuracy.|$|E
25|$|In {{a limited}} number of cases, an {{agreement}} will be unenforceable unless it meets a certain form prescribed by statute. While contracts can be generally made without formality, some transactions are thought to require form either because it makes a person think carefully before they bind themselves to an agreement, or merely that it serves as clear evidence. This goes typically for large engagements, including the sale of land, a lease of property over three years, a consumer credit agreement, and a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> A contract for guarantee must also, at some stage, be evidenced in writing. Finally, English law takes the approach that a gratuitous promise, as a matter of contract law, is not legally binding. While a gift that is delivered will transfer property irrevocably, and while someone may always bind themselves to a promise without anything in return to deliver a thing in future if they sign a deed that is witnessed, a simple promise to do something in future can be revoked. This result is reached, with some complexity, through a peculiarity of English law called the doctrine of consideration.|$|E
500|$|Garrow {{started as}} a {{criminal}} defence barrister at the Old Bailey, in a time where many defendants became increasingly reliant on barristers to prevent their conviction. His first case was actually as a prosecutor; on 14 January 1784, barely two months after he was called to the Bar, he prosecuted John Henry Aikles for obtaining a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> under false pretences. It was alleged that Aikles had promised to pay Samuel Edwards £100 and a small commission for a £100 <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange,</b> and {{when he took the}} bill, failed to hand over the money. Despite Aikles's counsel claiming, according to Edward Foss, that [...] "this was no felony", and being represented by two of the most prestigious criminal barristers of the day, Garrow convinced both the judge and the jury that Aikles was guilty. Garrow later defended Aikles in September 1785, securing his release due to ill-health.|$|E

Lilly {{was on her way}} to Bermuda when on 1 March she captured the Batavian Republic schooner Draak near Bermuda. Draak was armed with four 4-pounder guns and one long 3-pounder gun, and had a crew of 50 men under the command of a [...] "lieutenant of frigate" [...] Jan Justus Dingemans. She was seven weeks out of Curaçoa but had not taken anything. Lyall reported that the engagement lasted 15 minutes and that Draak made preparations to board Lilly, but then struck. The engagement resulted in a marine on Lilly losing his arm, and in the death of two men on Draak, and one wounded. Lyall described Draak as a four-year-old Bermuda-built vessel, coppered, and a remarkably fast sailer. After Lyall, Lilly again came under the command of Commander William Compton.|$|E
2500|$|In medieval Italy and Flanders, {{because of}} the {{insecurity}} and impracticality of transporting large sums of cash over long distances, money traders started using promissory notes. In the beginning these were personally registered, but they soon became a written order to pay the amount to whoever had it in their possession. These notes {{are seen as a}} predecessor to regular banknotes by some but are mainly thought of as proto bills of exchange and cheques. The term [...] "bank note" [...] comes from the notes of the bank ("nota di banco") and dates from the 14th century; it originally recognized the right of the holder of the note to collect the precious metal (usually gold or silver) deposited with a banker (via a currency account). In the 14th century, it was used in every part of Europe and in Italian city-state merchants colonies outside of Europe. For international payments, the more efficient and sophisticated <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> ("lettera di cambio"), that is, a promissory note based on a virtual currency account (usually a coin no longer physically existing), was used more often. All physical currencies were physically related to this virtual currency; this instrument also served as credit.|$|E

These bills certified that a particular person or company had paid a particular Medici branch a certain sum of money, as verified by the general or assistant manager of that branch (who {{were the only ones}} allowed to make out such bills). The bill instructed the recipient Medici branch to pay back that sum in local currency, but not at whatever the local exchange rate for the two currencies concerned happened to be at the moment the bill was presented to be cashed in, but rather at the exchange rate set when the presenting (or current owner; bills of exchange could be sold and traded freely) person bought the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> That there was a difference in time was guaranteed by the terms of the bill. A specific date could be set, but generally the time between a bill was issued in one city and could be cashed in at another was set by long-standing custom, or at usance. The usance between Florence and London was 3 months, for example.|$|E
