40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>benzylaminopurine</b> was studied on cyanide-resistant {{mitochondria}} isolated from aged slices of potato tuber (Solanum tuberosum L. var. Bintje). <b>Benzylaminopurine</b> specifically acted on the cyanide-resistant alternative pathway. In {{the case of}} succinate oxidation, it mimicked the action of salicylhydroxamic acid and restored a good oxidative phosphorylation. Kinetic analyses showed that inhibitions by <b>benzylaminopurine,</b> salicylhydroxamic acid, and disulfiram occurred at mutually exclusive sites on the alternative pathway. Cyanide-resistant malate oxidation was only partially inhibited by <b>benzylaminopurine</b> and this inhibition occurred for low concentrations of this compound.

40|$|Although, the {{ripening}} of climacteric fruits such as bananas {{is known}} to be mainly triggered by ethylene, cytokinins may also intervene in the control and regulation of this process. Bananas were treated by dipping for 24 h in solutions of cytokinins at concentrations ranging from 10 - 6 to 10 - 3 M to determine effects of these phytohormones on some parameters during the fruit ripening. At all concentrations used, <b>benzylaminopurine</b> induced significant retentions of water in the peel of banana fruits. Only 10 - 3 M kinetin solution was significantly effective in inhibiting the decrease of water content in the peel. There was an inhibition of the accumulation of water in the pulp of bananas after treatments with kinetin or <b>benzylaminopurine.</b> Qualitative analysis of pigments in peel extracts revealed an inhibition of chlorophyll degradation after application of cytokinins. Thus, banana fruits treated with 10 - 3 M kinetin still contained only chlorophyll a whereas, fruits treated with 10 - 3 M <b>benzylaminopurine</b> contained both chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b at ripening stage 7. At this ripening stage, no chlorophyll could be detected in extracts from the peel of control fruits. There were increased accumulations of monoacylglycerol, triacylglycerol and free fatty acids in the peel of banana fruits treated with 10 - 3 M <b>benzylaminopurine.</b> Contrarily to apolar lipids, no remarkable effects of treatments of bananas with 10 - 3 M <b>benzylaminopurine</b> on polar lipids could be observed. These results indicated that cytokinins modulated the metabolism of photosynthetic pigments and lipids and changes in the water content and that chlorophyll b was converted into chlorophyll a before its degradation in the peel of banana fruits during the ripening process...|$|E

40|$|Germination, {{ethylene}} production, {{and carbon}} dioxide production by dormant Virginia-type peanuts were determined during treatments with plant growth regulators. Kinetin, <b>benzylaminopurine,</b> and 2 -chloroethylphosphonic acid induced extensive germination above the water controls. <b>Benzylaminopurine</b> and 2 -chloroethylphosphonic acid increased the germination of the more dormant basal seeds to a larger extent above the controls than the less dormant apical seeds. Coumarin induced a slight stimulation of germination while abscisic acid, 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and succinic acid 2, 2 -dimethylhydrazide did not stimulate germination above the controls. In addition to stimulating germination, the cytokinins also stimulated ethylene production by the seeds. In the case of <b>benzylaminopurine,</b> where the more dormant basal seeds were stimulated to germinate above the control to a larger extent than the less dormant apical seeds, correspondingly more ethylene production was induced in the basal seeds. However, the opposite was true of kinetin for both germination and ethylene production. When germination was extensively stimulated by the cytokinins, maximal ethylene {{and carbon dioxide}} evolution occurred at 24 and 72 hours, respectively. Abscisic acid inhibited ethylene production and germinaton of the seeds while carbon dioxide evolution was comparatively high. The crucial physiological event for germination of dormant peanut seeds was enhancement of ethylene production by the seeds...|$|E

Methods: In this interventional study, the effects of cultivar and size of the inflorescence explant and the gibberellin hormone in two levels, <b>benzylaminopurine,</b> and auxin hormones in three levels with three replicates per treatment were evaluated in relation to phenol ratio, in order to evaluate the effect of plant growth regulators, the type and size of the grape inflorescence explant on the phenol production.
