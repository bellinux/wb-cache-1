5|$|In 2003, Boeing {{introduced}} overhead crew rests as {{an option}} on the 777. Located above the main cabin and connected via staircases, the forward flight crew rest contains two seats and two <b>bunks,</b> while the aft cabin crew rest features multiple <b>bunks.</b> The Signature Interior has since been adapted for other Boeing wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, including 737NG, 747-400, 757-300, and newer 767 models, including all 767-400ER models. The 747-8 and 767-400ER have also adopted the larger, more rounded windows of the original 777.|$|E
5|$|Third-class {{passenger}} accommodations {{were located}} on the main deck: three compartments for men located forward, and a single compartment for families at the rear. The family compartment had state rooms containing either two, four, or six <b>bunks.</b> All compartments had well-lighted dining areas and wide hallways that led to lavatories and sanitary facilities on the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|Crew {{facilities}} {{will include}} a cinema, physical fitness areas and four galleys manned by sixty-seven catering staff. There are four large dining areas, the largest with the capacity to serve 960 meals in one hour. There are eleven medical staff for the eight-bed medical facility, which includes an operating theatre and a dental surgery. There are 1,600 <b>bunks</b> in 470 cabins, including accommodation for a company of 250 Royal Marines with wide assault routes up to the flight deck.|$|E

50|$|A <b>bunk</b> bed is {{two or more}} beds one {{atop the}} other. <b>Bunk</b> beds are used for adults in {{military}} barracks and in some ski lodges. <b>Bunk</b> beds are used for children and teens in summer camps. Some inexpensive hostels provide <b>bunk</b> beds for guests. <b>Bunk</b> beds are used for children in private homes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bunk</b> tells McNulty that Ray Cole {{caught the}} Stinkum murder. McNulty tells <b>Bunk</b> that Omar was the shooter, and asks {{him to tell}} Cole that they have some talk on the wire, and will give him a closed case once their case is finished; both <b>Bunk</b> and McNulty regret the lie, and go out {{drinking}} to soothe their consciences. They discuss the strange position of protecting Omar from the murder investigation. <b>Bunk</b> spots a woman he wishes to bed, and asks McNulty to cover for him with his wife. Later, McNulty is called by the woman to come and collect <b>Bunk,</b> who is so drunk {{that he decided to}} burn his clothes to destroy the evidence of his infidelity. McNulty brings <b>Bunk</b> back to his own house and deposits him in the empty <b>bunk</b> bed normally used by his sons. <b>Bunk</b> mumbles that McNulty is bad for the people around him before falling asleep. McNulty will still remember <b>Bunk's</b> words years later.|$|R
5|$|A second {{mandatory}} {{roll call}} {{took place in}} the evening. If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered, regardless of the weather conditions, even if it took hours. After roll call, individual and collective punishments were meted out, depending on what had happened during the day, before the prisoners were allowed to retire to their blocks for the night and receive their bread rations and water. Curfew was two or three hours later. The prisoners slept in long rows of wooden <b>bunks,</b> lying in and on their clothes and shoes to prevent them from being stolen.|$|E
5|$|In May 1997, {{two groups}} of six female sailors were posted to Collins and Farncomb to test the {{feasibility}} of mixed-sex submarine companies. Following the trial's success, eleven female sailors and one female officer commenced submarine training in 1998. Officers and senior enlisted submariners slept in mixed accommodation, but junior enlisted submariners could only be deployed in groups of six: one of the enlisted cabins was set aside, and all six <b>bunks</b> in the cabin had to be filled. Mixed accommodation for all female submariners was approved in June 2011, {{in order to increase}} posting opportunities and help make up shortfalls in submarine complements.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{the living}} hut were two small ante-rooms, one {{used as a}} {{photographic}} darkroom, the other for taxidermy. Within the main accommodation area daylight was admitted via a double-glazed and shuttered window and through a small square pane high on the northern wall. <b>Bunks</b> were fitted around the outer walls, and a table and stove dominated {{the centre of the}} hut. During the few brief weeks before winter set in, members of the party made trial sledging journeys on the sea ice in nearby Robertson Bay, during which they surveyed the coastline and collected specimens of birds and fish. They also slaughtered seals and penguins for food and fuel. Outside activities were largely curtailed in Mid-May, with the onset of severe winter weather.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bunk</b> and McNulty {{spend the}} night {{drinking}} together and <b>Bunk</b> notices that McNulty seems to be cutting back his alcohol intake. <b>Bunk</b> speculates that Omar Little was involved in Stringer's murder, {{on the basis of}} the shotgun shells found at the scene. He believes that they will match the casings from the double homicide of Tank and Tosha Mitchell, where he also believes Omar was involved. McNulty tells <b>Bunk</b> that it may have been Marlo Stanfield rather than Omar. <b>Bunk</b> worries that the murder rate is spiraling out of control. <b>Bunk</b> urges McNulty to drink more, but instead he takes <b>Bunk</b> home. Cheryl phones McNulty to find out why Kima has not returned home and he covers for her.|$|R
50|$|Lowenthal calls <b>Bunk</b> back to {{the crime}} lab {{the next day and}} reports a match to Chris Partlow from DNA found on Devar Manigault’s body. <b>Bunk</b> {{delivers}} Omar’s list to McNulty and tells him about Omar’s death. <b>Bunk</b> tells McNulty that Omar was hunting the Stanfield organization and offers the list as payback for McNulty’s assistance with the lab. McNulty asks <b>Bunk</b> to hold back on the Partlow murder warrant to allow Freamon to make a break in the Stanfield investigation and <b>Bunk</b> reluctantly agrees. <b>Bunk</b> tells McNulty that he made his case the honest way and McNulty responds that without the fake serial killer <b>Bunk</b> would still be awaiting the lab work.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bunk</b> {{checks the}} name Peanut and finds 89 matches, all Number 1 Males (BPD's {{numerical}} description of black men) in West Baltimore. Detective Holley laughs at <b>Bunk's</b> misfortune. Holley then gets a call himself - {{the shooting of}} Tank and Tosha. Holley manages to convince <b>Bunk</b> {{to be the primary}} as he already has another case. Holley accompanies <b>Bunk</b> to the crime scene as the assisting detective, while there <b>Bunk</b> considers Holley's opinion that Tosha was caught in the crossfire. <b>Bunk</b> notices children nearby pretending to be Omar and acting out the shooting. One of the children is Kenard. As <b>Bunk</b> ties up his case notes at the office Sergeant Jay Landsman confronts him and orders him {{to get back to work}} on finding Dozerman's gun.|$|R
5|$|On 3 February 1969 {{the first}} RVN {{officers}} reported aboard Point Garnet and Point League for an 18-week pilot training program. Each cutter's executive officer was relieved and assigned staff duties ashore with {{the commanding officer}} assuming his duties. The two spare <b>bunks</b> on each cutter were utilized by the new Vietnamese personnel reporting on board. As experience was gained by the Vietnamese crew members, new junior personnel reported in pairs replacing Coast Guardsmen that were then assigned ashore {{to assist with the}} VECTOR phase of training. The first transfer of Squadron One cutters occurred at the RVN Base in Saigon during joint decommissioning and commissioning ceremonies held 16 May 1969 by the Coast Guard and the RVN. Point Garnet and Point League were the first cutters transferred under the ACTOV plan.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{needed more}} ships as war approached. The 'Ocean' design was revised and {{simplified}} to allow mass production. This new design {{was the basis}} for the Liberty ship. On December 7, 1941 Japan attacked the military bases at Hawaii, Guam, and a few days later, the Philippines. Liberty ships carried weapons, ammunition, food, tools, hardware, vehicles, and other things for the war effort. They could also be equipped to carry a large number of troops by rigging <b>bunks</b> in the holds similar to those used by the armed guard. Liberty ships began taking troops and materials wherever they were needed, crossing both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Like other Liberty Ships, John Burke transported war materials between the United States and the rear areas of the Pacific War, often calling at Pearl Harbor, Australia, Guadalcanal, Hollandia and Manaus.|$|E
5|$|Troop kitchens, rolling galleys, {{also joined}} the trains to provide meal service en route (the troops took their meals {{in their seats}} or <b>bunks).</b> As the cooking was {{performed}} by regular U.S. Army cooks, the cars were outfitted with two Army-standard coal ranges. The cars were also equipped {{with a pair of}} 200-gallon cold water tanks and a 40-gallon hot water tank; supplies were stocked on open shelves with marine-type railings, a bread locker, a large refrigerator, and a series of built-in cabinets and drawers. The cars served approximately 250 men each, and were typically placed {{in the middle of the}} train so that food could be served from both ends.|$|E

5|$|Troop sleepers, {{generally}} {{intended for}} use by enlisted personnel, were equipped with <b>bunks</b> stacked 3-high, and slept 29 servicemen plus the Pullman porter. Every passenger was provided with a separate Pullman bed, complete with sheets and pillowcases that were changed daily. The berths were {{laid out in a}} cross-wise arrangement that placed the aisle along one side of the car, as opposed to down the center. Though the upper berths were fixed, the middle and lower sections could be reconfigured into seating during the daytime. Weapon racks were provided for each group of berths. Four washstands (two mounted {{at each end of the}} car) delivered hot and cold running water. The cars also came outfitted with two enclosed toilets and a drinking water cooler.|$|E
5|$|In late 1918, Virginia was {{overhauled}} at the Boston Navy Yard, {{after which}} she was tasked with escorting convoys halfway across the Atlantic, to rendezvous points where other escorts would take them to France. Her first convoya troopship convoy with 12,176 soldiers aboardleft New York on 14 October. She escorted another convoy on 12 November, though Germany signed the Armistice that ended the fighting in Europe the day before. With the war over, Virginia was equipped to transport American soldiers back from France; the modifications included extra <b>bunks</b> and mess facilities. On 17 December, she steamed out of Norfolk on her first of five trips to Brest, France. This trip was made in company with her sister ship , and the two ships arrived in Brest on 30 December. They took on 2,043 soldiers before departing three days later. Her last voyage ended on 4 July 1919 in Boston, {{and in the course}} of the five trips, she carried 6,037 soldiers back to the United States.|$|E
5|$|She {{arrived at}} Sydney on 24 August, {{and had her}} hangars {{refitted}} to accommodate Allied PoWs and soldiers for repatriation. Having left her air group behind to maximize the numbers of passengers she could carry, the ship arrived at Manila on 25 September, where she loaded over 2,000 American and Canadian PoWs. She dropped off the Americans at Pearl Harbor on 5 October and continued on to deliver her Canadian passengers at Vancouver six days later. Opened for public tours, Implacable remained for a week before sailing to Hong Kong to pick up several hundred PoWs and continued onwards to Manila to load 2,114 more passengers. She delivered them to Balikpapan, Borneo for transhipment to Britain. In their place the carrier embarked 2,126 men of the 7th Australian Division, and their equipment, to return to Australia. She arrived at Sydney on 17 November and sailed on 8 December to load more returning troops from Papua New Guinea. Arriving back at Sydney before Christmas, the ship had her additional <b>bunks,</b> etc., removed to return her to operational status.|$|E

5|$|The Pacific weather proved {{favourable}} but by August the {{two ships}} had {{lost sight of}} each other and continued their voyage separately. On 23 August Prince of Wales rounded Cape Horn alone and headed northeast and north on a path to Rio. Throughout the voyage her crew had been heavily reliant on a diet of salted meat and by early September scurvy had incapacitated the majority. Mason died from the condition on 9 October, and another 13 men were too ill to leave their <b>bunks.</b> When Rio was finally sighted on 13 October the crew were too sick to bring the ship to port. She drifted helplessly in the outer harbor until Rio's harbourmaster sighted her the following morning and had additional seamen rowed out to assist. Twelve of Prince of Wales sickest crew members were hospitalised in Rio while the remainder recovered on board.|$|E
5|$|The first crews {{arrived at}} Subic Bay on 11 June and a {{squadron}} office was established. On 12 June 1965, the squadron {{came under the}} operational control of the commander, Vietnam Patrol Force (CTF 71). Administrative control for personnel actions such as pay and personnel records was retained by the Coast Guard. The first cutters arrived at Subic Bay on 17 June and before they were put in the water each hull bottom was inspected, repaired if necessary and painted from the waterline down. Mechanical, ordnance, electrical and electronic maintenance checks were completed before any modifications for duty in Vietnam were attempted. Modifications completed at Subic Bay included new radio transceivers, fabrication of gunner's platforms and ammunition ready boxes for the mortar, the addition of floodlights for night boardings, installation of small arms lockers on the mess deck and addition of sound-powered telephone circuits. Additional <b>bunks</b> and refrigerators were added to increase patrol on-station time. Modifications {{were made to the}} bow-mounted over-under machine gun mortar combination allowing it to be depressed below the horizon for close-range firing. Four additional M-2 machine guns with ready boxes were added to the gunwales of each cutter.|$|E
5|$|The {{battleship}} bombarded Iwo Jima from 19–22 February {{in support}} of the invasion there before escorting carriers which sent aircraft raids against Tokyo and targets on the island of Kyūshū. On 24 March and 19 April, Washington bombarded Okinawa; she then departed for Puget Sound to receive a refit, having been in action {{for the majority of the}} time since its refit in March–April 1944. This lasted through V-J Day and the subsequent formal ceremony aboard , so Washington received orders to voyage to Philadelphia, where she arrived on 17 October. Here she was modified to have an additional 145 <b>bunks,</b> so that she could participate in Operation Magic Carpet. Sailing to Southampton with a reduced crew of 84officers and 835crew, she brought 185army officers and 1,479enlisted men back to the United States; this was the only voyage she would make {{in support of}} the operation. The battleship was placed into reserve at Bayonne, New Jersey on 27 June 1947, after only a little more than six years of service. Washington was never reactivated. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1960—exactly 21 years to the day since its launch—she was sold on 24 May 1961 to be scrapped.|$|E
