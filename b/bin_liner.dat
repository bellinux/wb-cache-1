500|$|In April 1999, Victoria Climbié (born 2 November 1991 in Abobo, Côte d'Ivoire, died 25 February 2000 at St. Mary's Hospital, London) and {{her great}} aunt Marie-Thérèse Kouao arrived in London, sent {{by her parents}} for a chance of an education. A few months later, Kouao met Carl Manning on a bus which he was driving, and she and Victoria moved into his flat. It was here that she was abused, {{including}} being beaten with hammers, bike chains, and wires; being forced {{to sleep in a}} <b>bin</b> <b>liner</b> in the bath; and being tied up for periods of over 24 hours. In the period leading up to her death, the police, the social services of many local authorities, the NHS, the NSPCC, and local churches all had contact with her, and noted the signs of abuse. However, in what the judge in the trial following Victoria's death described as [...] "blinding incompetence", all failed to properly investigate the abuse and little action was taken. On 24 February 2000, Victoria was admitted into an accident-and-emergency department, semi-unconscious and suffering from hypothermia, multiple organ failure and malnutrition. She died the next day, aged eight. On 20 November 2000, her guardians, Marie Thérèse Kouao and Carl Manning, were charged with child cruelty and murder; on 12 January 2001, both were found guilty, and sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
500|$|From October 1999 to January 2000, Manning forced Climbié {{to sleep}} in a <b>bin</b> <b>liner</b> in the bathtub in her own excrement. During a later police interview, Manning said this was because of her {{frequent}} bedwetting. At Haringey social services on 1 November 1999, Kouao told social workers that Manning sexually assaulted Climbié, but withdrew the accusation the following day. In one of Arthurworrey's visits, during a conversation about housing, Arthurworrey said that the council accommodated only children who were believed to be at serious risk. Laming said in his report, [...] "it may be no coincidence that within three days of this conversation, Kouao contacted Ms. Arthurworrey to make allegations which, if true, would have placed Victoria squarely within that category". Jones sent a letter to Kouao, which was ignored, and no further action was taken. Manning later denied the allegation. Alan Hodges, the police sergeant overseeing the investigation, claimed in the inquiry that the social workers were obstructing the police in dealing with child protection cases. Between December 1999 and January 2000, Arthurworrey made three visits to the flat, but she received no answer. She speculated to her supervisor, Carole Baptiste, that they had returned to France. Despite no evidence, her supervisor wrote on Climbié's file that they had left the area. On 18 February 2000 they wrote to Kouao saying that if they did not receive any contact from them, they would close the case. A week later, on 25 February 2000, they closed the case—on the same day that Climbié died.|$|E

2500|$|The police search {{operation}} was headed by Detective Superintendent Doug Smith of Cleveland Police and involved door-to-door inquiries, tracker dogs, and local volunteers. Warehouses, industrial buildings, and disused buildings around the adjacent docks were searched while HM Coastguard, a police helicopter, and a Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat searched {{the sea and}} shore. Police first called at Armstrong's flat on 1 July while conducting initial door-to-door inquiries during which residents were asked to answer a questionnaire aimed at tracing her last movements. On 2 July they returned while carrying out [...] "cursory searches" [...] of houses in the area. On 3 July two detectives spoke to Armstrong; they noticed that his previously [...] "co-operative, friendly and helpful" [...] demeanour had changed, and that he then appeared [...] "very shifty, on edge and looking very worried". Acting on suspicion, the detectives arrested Armstrong and a second search of his first-floor flat was conducted. Palmer's mutilated {{body was found in}} a <b>bin</b> <b>liner</b> inside an airing cupboard in the flat. Her shorts and underwear were found nearby in a separate bag. Armstrong denied any involvement in the crime and claimed that [...] "someone else must have put the body there".|$|E

Purposely ripped clothes were {{held together by}} safety pins or wrapped with tape; black <b>bin</b> <b>liners</b> (garbage bags) became dresses, shirts and skirts. Other items added to clothing or as jewellery included razor blades and chains. Leather, rubber and vinyl clothing have been common, possibly due to their connection with transgressive sexual practices, such as bondage and S&M.|$|R

50|$|A bin bag or <b>bin</b> <b>liner</b> (British English) or garbage bag, or {{trash bag}} (American English) is a {{disposable}} bag used to contain rubbish (British English), or the North American equivalent trash or garbage.

Most bags these days are made out of plastic, and are typically black in color.|$|E

5000|$|After {{initially}} laying Hinz {{out with}} a [...] "martial arts" [...] kick, McDowell proceeded to strangle Hinz before dismembering his body with a rip saw. The body parts were wrapped in <b>bin</b> <b>liners</b> and put out onto a street near St Pancras Way for the rubbish collectors. Their subsequent decomposition, exacerbated by summer heat, led to a [...] "terrible smell" [...] and a cloud of flies that eventually led to their gruesome discovery.|$|R

When he {{discovered}} {{that they were not}} being sold, but thrown out with the rubbish, he started to leave them in the streets instead, with works leaning on lampposts, doors and wheelie bins, as an open exhibition, which looked [...] "really surreal". He could produce around 20 paintings a night, and around 1,000 a year. Over a five-year period, he left thousands of his works in London streets.|$|R

5000|$|Early punk fashion adapted {{everyday}} {{objects for}} aesthetic effect: ripped clothing was {{held together by}} safety pins or wrapped with tape; ordinary clothing was customised by embellishing it with marker or adorning it with paint; a black <b>bin</b> <b>liner</b> became a dress, shirt or skirt; safety pins and razor blades were used as jewellery. Also popular have been leather, rubber, and vinyl clothing that the general public associates with transgressive sexual practices like bondage and S&M. A designer associated with early UK punk fashion was Vivienne Westwood, who made clothes for Malcolm McLaren's boutique in the King's Road, which became famous as [...] "SEX".|$|E
50|$|One {{publication}} {{of that period}} did find an audience. Viz began life in 1979 as a fanzine style publication, before, in 1989, becoming the biggest selling magazine in the country. Based upon bad taste, crude language, crude sexual innuendo, and the parodying of strips from The Dandy (among them Black Bag - the Faithful Border <b>Bin</b> <b>Liner,</b> a parody of The Dandys Black Bob series about a Border Collie), the popularity of Viz depended entirely upon a variant of Sixties counter-culture; and it promptly inspired similarly themed titles, including Smut, Spit!, Talking Turkey, Elephant Parts, Gas, Brain Damage, Poot!, UT and Zit, all of which failed to achieve Vizs longevity and folded, while Viz remained one of the United Kingdoms top selling magazines.|$|E
50|$|By the mid-1900s, the {{expansion}} of recycling infrastructure in the United States yielded a 7% annual rate of plastic bag recycling. This corresponded to more than 800000000 lb of bags and plastic film being recycled in 2007 alone. Each ton of recycled plastic bags saves the energy equivalent of 11 barrels of oil, although most bags are produced from natural-gas-derived stock. In light of a 2002 Australian study showing that more than 60% of bags are reused as <b>bin</b> <b>liners</b> and for other purposes, the 7% recycling rate accounts for 17.5% of the plastic bags available for recycling.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} looners also enjoy other variations, such as rubber glove {{balloons}} (mainly latex and nitrile medical gloves), condoms, beach balls, the Wubble Bubble Ball, inflatable PVC plastic toys (mainly blow up sharks, whales, and hammers), and inflating <b>bin</b> <b>liners</b> or garbage bags. The latter is often {{combined with a}} crush fetish where the looner is aroused the sight of glossy, polyethylene garbage sacks being compressed by the hydraulic compactor of a garbage truck or other similar apparatus {{to the point where}} they burst or explode - in its most extreme form this may even be combined with a form of vorarephilia, where the looner desires to be crushed and consumed by the machine itself along with the sacks.|$|R
40|$|Biocomposites {{have emerged}} {{to become one}} of the most sought-after materials, these days. Yet, their high cost, limits their applications. On this regard, the {{blending}} of low-cost fillers into the biodegradable polymer may be an alternative solution. This present work concentrates on the development of Polybutyrate/waste GFRP powder (Both Raw and Treated) composites. These composites were synthesized by melt mixing using a Haake Rheocord. Later, samples were prepared by Compression Moulding Technique, followed by Punching and Saw-Cutting. The samples were then tested for Mechanical (Tensile, Flexural and Impact Properties) and Morphological behaviour. The results indicate that the blending was highly successful in improving the fore said properties, while reducing the cost effectively. These biocomposites could be applied in packaging, garden products, waste <b>bin</b> <b>liners,</b> etc...|$|R
50|$|Milligan {{was found}} dead in his flat in Black Lion Lane, Chiswick, London, by his {{secretary}} Vera Taggart on 7 February 1994. Milligan had failed to appear in the House of Commons as expected, and so Taggart went to look for him. Milligan's corpse was naked except for a pair of stockings and suspenders, with an electrical flex tied around his neck and a black <b>bin</b> <b>liner</b> over his head, with an orange segment in his mouth. The coroner concluded that he had died {{in the early hours of}} 7 February. The pathologists report into Milligan's death discounted the possibility of murder, lending weight to the belief that he died accidentally, as a result of autoerotic asphyxiation. No drugs or alcohol were found in his blood, and no substances were found to have contributed to his death.|$|E

The Ju Ju Babies were characterised by their deliberately poor quality sound and lyrics, {{and by their}} unusual clothing, with Woods generally appearing on stage wearing clothing made from <b>bin</b> <b>liners</b> and hazard tape, a style later copied {{by a number of}} other female and transvestite performers on the London club, gay and goth music scenes. In 2004, the band were the resident live band at the weekly Manumission club night at Privilege, the world's largest nightclub. They were also the first band to perform at Ibiza Rocks, which they did for a period of four months in 2004.

5000|$|During the 2015 Manx Heritage Transport Festival {{some of the}} {{stations}} along {{the route of the}} extant Port Erin Line were renamed as former stations of the Manx Northern Railway with Castletown being designated as Wild Life Park on 1 August 2015 only. The station's running in boards were covered with plastic signs denoting this, with selected other useful signage for passengers being removed {{for the duration of the}} event. One locomotive, No. 10 G.H. Wood was also temporarily renamed to appear as No. 5 Mona during the day, with other stations taking on dual roles, Port Erin becoming Ramsey and Douglas becoming St. John's; the request stops at both The Level and Ronaldsway Halt were not renamed, with <b>bin</b> <b>liners</b> covering the running in boards at these sites. The original halt at Ballavolley opened during the summer of 1965 upon the establishment of the Wild Life Park, consisting of a simple running in board and ground level grassed platform. It was again used during the brief reopening of the Ramsey Line 1967, taking its name from the nearby level crossing (the gatehouse of which remains extant today), being named [...] "Ballavolley Halt - For Wild Life Park" [...] rather than the [...] "Wildlife Park" [...] title used during the reenactment.|$|R
500|$|Burton {{insisted that}} the film be bloody, as he felt stage {{versions}} of the play which {{cut back on the}} bloodshed robbed it of its power. For him, [...] "Everything is so internal with Sweeney that [...] is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing." [...] Producer Richard D. Zanuck said that [...] " [...] had a very clear plan that he wanted to lift that up into a surreal, almost Kill Bill kind of stylization. We had done tests and experiments with the neck slashing, with the blood popping out. I remember saying to Tim, 'My God, do we dare do this?'" [...] On set, the fake blood was colored orange to render correctly on the desaturated color film used, and crew members wore <b>bin</b> <b>liners</b> to avoid getting stained while filming. This macabre tone made some studios nervous, and it was not until Warner Bros., DreamWorks and Paramount had signed up for the project that the film's $50 million budget was covered. Burton said [...] "the studio was cool about it and they accepted it because they knew what the show was. Any movie is a risk, but it is {{nice to be able to}} do something like that that doesn't fit into the musical or slasher movie categories." ...|$|R
5000|$|Matthews most {{prominent}} storyline spans {{a year and}} begins on the Valentines day episode in February 1999. After developing a friendship with club owner Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), Matthew is present to witness Steve accidentally killing his ex-girlfriend Saskia Duncan (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor) by hitting her {{on the head with}} a marbel ashtray following her jealous attack on him. Saskias death was first screened in a lengthened 45-minute episode on a Sunday evening, deviating from EastEnders typical broadcasting weekday slots. Executive producer Matthew Robinson has alleged that Saskias death scene had to be reshot because it was deemed too violent: [...] "When we played back the film, it was fantastic - too fantastic. It looked so real that I knew we couldnt broadcast it. EastEnders goes out before the nine oclock watershed, children watch it - and we cant show outright scenes of graphic violence. We had to do the whole thing again. It took almost two hours and the three actors were emotionally and physically exhausted. In the end we got what we wanted." [...] After the killing, Steve fears that police will not believe it was an accident, convinces Matthew to help him cover-up the death and they bundle Saskias body into a <b>bin</b> <b>liner</b> and bury it in a wood. Robinson said, [...] "This is an exciting plot and itll keep us occupied for much of the next year." ...|$|E

He holds Mercedes hostage and forces her into the car, driving off and leaving Clare's corpse in the road. He takes her to the empty McQueen house and attempts to kill her, but Cindy and Lindsey arrive in time and knock him unconscious. Doctor Browning awakens and attempts to attack the women so Mercedes strikes Doctor Browning over the head with a shovel, killing him. The three women panic and put Doctor Browning's corpse into <b>bin</b> <b>liners,</b> stashing it in the attic of the McQueen home. When they discover that the attic is going to have new insulation a few weeks later, the three women scramble to dispose of the corpse and enlist the help of Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham) to hide the body. Mercedes, Cindy and Lindsey place Doctor Browning's body in his car and push it off a cliff, making it appear that Doctor Browning had committed suicide after escaping prison. Cindy panics and alerts the police to the car crash scene. Police officer Sam Lomax (Lizzie Roper) discovers that Mercedes, Cindy and Lindsey were involved in Doctor Browning's murder and brings them in for questioning. When they all confess, she releases them, explaining that she has had to make some decisions to get rid of bad people, and the three women are set free, and Sam disposes of the evidence.|$|R
5000|$|Music-based subcultures are {{particularly}} vulnerable to this process; what may be considered subcultures at one stage in their historiessuch as jazz, goth, punk, hip hop and rave culturesmay represent mainstream taste within a short period. Some subcultures reject or modify the importance of style, stressing membership through the adoption of an ideology which may be much more resistant to commercial exploitation. The punk subculture's distinctive (and initially shocking) style of clothing was adopted by mass-market fashion companies once the subculture became a media interest. Dick Hebdige argues that the punk subculture shares the same [...] "radical aesthetic practices" [...] as Dada and surrealism:Like Duchamp's 'ready mades' - manufactured objects which qualified as art because he chose to call them such, the most unremarkable and inappropriate items - a pin, a plastic clothes peg, a television component, a razor blade, a tampon - could be brought within the province of punk (un)fashion ... Objects borrowed from the most sordid of contexts found a place in punks' ensembles; lavatory chains were draped in graceful arcs across chests in plastic <b>bin</b> <b>liners.</b> Safety pins were taken out of their domestic 'utility' context and worn as gruesome ornaments through the cheek, ear or lip ... fragments of school uniform (white bri-nylon shirts, school ties) were symbolically defiled (the shirts covered in graffiti, or fake blood; the ties left undone) and juxtaposed against leather drains or shocking pink mohair tops.|$|R
