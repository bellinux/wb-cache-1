40|$|INTRODUCTION: Our {{ability to}} predict a {{positive}} electrophysiologic (EP) {{study in the}} evaluation of unexplained syncope is suboptimal. AIMS: In patients with unexplained syncope, we defined clinical predictors of <b>bradyarrhythmia</b> and ventricular tachycardia (VT) diagnosed during EP study, constructed diagnostic score indices for <b>bradyarrhythmia</b> and VT, and evaluated the predictive power of each score index. METHODS: All patients evaluated in the Arrhythmia Clinic for unexplained syncope from January 1, 1996, through December 31, 1998, were identified and enrolled in the study. Five hundred eight patients (325 [64 %] men; mean+/-SD age, 64 +/- 17 years) underwent EP testing. We analyzed elements from historical data and noninvasive laboratory findings as predictors of <b>bradyarrhythmia</b> and VT diagnosed on EP study. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (11 %) had sinus node dysfunction, 94 (19 %) had atrioventricular (AV) node disease, 92 (18 %) had His-Purkinje system disease, and 101 (20 %) had VT. Models were fit using logistic regression analysis. Predictors were assigned weighted scores, and a score index was formulated. The area under the curve associated with sinus node dysfunction, AV node disease, His-Purkinje system disease, and VT models was 0. 64, 0. 60, 0. 84, and 0. 60, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We have constructed diagnostic score indices for EP outcomes of <b>bradyarrhythmia</b> and VT in syncope.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the use of amiodarone in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of <b>bradyarrhythmia</b> requiring a permanent pacemaker. BackgroundReports of severe <b>bradyarrhythmia</b> during amiodarone therapy are infrequent and limited to studies assessing the therapy’s use in the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias. MethodsA study cohort of 8, 770 patients age ≥ 65 years with a new diagnosis of AF was identified from a provincewide database of Quebec residents with a myocardial infarction (MI) between 1991 and 1999. Using a nested case-control design, 477 cases of <b>bradyarrhythmia</b> requiring a permanent pacemaker were matched (1 : 4) to 1, 908 controls. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of pacemaker insertion associated with amiodarone use, controlling for baseline risk factors and exposure to sotalol, Class I antiarrhythmic agents, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin. ResultsAmiodarone use was associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion (OR: 2. 14, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 30 to 3. 54). This effect was modified by gender, with a greater risk in women versus men (OR: 3. 86, 95 % CI: 1. 70 to 8. 75 vs. OR: 1. 52, 95 % CI: 0. 80 to 2. 89). Digoxin was the only other medication associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion (OR: 1. 78, 95 % CI: 1. 37 to 2. 31). ConclusionsThis study suggests that the use of amiodarone in elderly patients with AF and a previous MI increases the risk of <b>bradyarrhythmia</b> requiring a permanent pacemaker.

In our investigation, we injected MSCs transduced with or without mHCN 4 into the rabbit left ventricle free wall epicardium. Chemical ablation of the sinoatrial node was performed and bilateral vagus nerves were sequentially stimulated to observe premature left ventricular contraction or left ventricular rhythm. We found that the mHCN 4 -transduced MSC group had a significantly higher ventricular rate and a shorter QRS duration {{than that of the}} control and EGFP group. Furthermore, the mHCN 4 -transduced MSCs, but not the control cells, gradually adapted long-spindle morphology and became indistinguishable from adjacent ventricle myocytes. The modified MSCs showed pacing function approximately 1 week after transplantation and persisted at least 4 weeks after transplantation. In conclusion, a <b>bradyarrhythmia</b> model can be successfully established by chemical ablation of the sinoatrial node and sequential bilateral vagus nerve stimulation.
