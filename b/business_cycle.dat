5|$|Macroeconomics descends {{from two}} areas of research: <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> theory and {{monetary}} theory. Monetary theory {{dates back to}} the 16th century and the work of Martín de Azpilcueta, while <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> analysis dates from the mid 19th.|$|E
5|$|Other economists {{focused more}} on theory in their <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> analysis. Most <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> {{theories}} focused on a single factor, such as monetary policy or the impact of weather on the largely agricultural economies of the time. Although <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> theory was well established by the 1920s, work by theorists such as Dennis Robertson and Ralph Hawtrey had little impact on public policy. Their partial equilibrium theories could not capture general equilibrium, where markets interact with each other; in particular, early <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> theories treated goods markets and financial markets separately. Research in these areas used microeconomic methods to explain employment, price level, and interest rates.|$|E

40|$|The idea of <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> {{asymmetry}} {{is not new}} {{in economic}} theory. According to <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> asymmetry, a country’s economy behaves differently during economic growth periods as compared to economic recession periods. The results achieved by <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> asymmetry testing are far from unanimous: some are positive, others are negative. <b>Business</b> <b>cycles</b> asymmetry has major econometric implications: <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> cannot be modeled using linear models. This paper aims to test <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> asymmetry in Central and Eastern European Countries, where few <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> analyses, and especially <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> asymmetry researches, have been conducted. The industrial production index was considered when testing <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> asymmetry.

According to our results, <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> in Central and Eastern European countries are not asymmetric...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAccording to {{economic}} theory, economic variables evolve differently on <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> stages, i. e. they are asymmetric. The results of <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> asymmetry testing are rather divergent: some support <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> asymmetry while others contradict it. The {{existence of a}} possible <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> asymmetry has major implications in economic stabilization policies modeling, forecasting and application. There are rather few studies on <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> stylized facts in Romania and they fai l to tackle <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> asymmetry. Therefore, the purpose of our research is to test the possible <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> asymmetry in several Romanian macroeconomic variables. We estimated the <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> of the variables under survey using the Hodrick– Prescott filter, whereas for the tests conducted on the <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> asymmetry recorded we preferred Sichel's (1993) methodology. We checked the robustness of the results recorded by <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> estimation using the Beveridge Nelson decomposition. The results of the <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> analysis carried out on Romanian macroeconomic variables {{do not support the}} existence of any <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> asymmetry...|$|R
40|$|The {{economies of}} the {{capitalist}} countries are continuously facing fluctuations known as <b>business</b> <b>cycles.</b> The estimation of global <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> {{as well as of}} <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> of different macroeconomic variables expressing {{the state of the economy}} are of utter importance for the decision making process having as a final goal the reduction of recession periods. The unemployment rate is known as a lagging indicator for the <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> and it can offer important information regarding the <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> forecasting. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze in a comparative manner the general <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> and the <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> of unemployment rate in the CEE countries. The results confirm the persistence of the <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> under analysis and the existence of great differences by countries of the reaction of unemployment <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> to general <b>business</b> <b>cycles...</b>|$|R
5|$|Anna Schwartz {{collaborated with}} Friedman to produce one of monetarism's major works, A Monetary History of the United States (1963), which linked money {{supply to the}} <b>business</b> <b>cycle.</b> The Keynesians of the 1950s and 60s had adopted the view that {{monetary}} policy does not impact aggregate output or the <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> based on evidence that, during the Great Depression, interest rates had been extremely low but output remained depressed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that Keynesians only looked at nominal rates and neglected the role inflation plays in real interest rates, which had been high {{during much of the}} Depression. In real terms, monetary policy had effectively been contractionary, putting downward pressure on output and employment, even though economists looking only at nominal rates thought monetary policy had been stimulative.|$|E
5|$|Milton Friedman {{developed}} {{an alternative to}} Keynesian macroeconomics eventually labeled monetarism. Generally monetarism {{is the idea that}} the supply of money matters for the macroeconomy. When monetarism emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, Keynesians neglected the role money played in inflation and the <b>business</b> <b>cycle,</b> and monetarism directly challenged those points.|$|E
5|$|Under the synthesis, debates {{have become}} less ideological and more methodological. <b>Business</b> <b>cycle</b> modelers {{can be broken}} into two camps: those in favor of {{calibration}} and those in favor of estimation. When models are calibrated, the modeler selects parameter values based on other studies or casual empirical observation. Instead of using statistical diagnostics to evaluate models, the model's operating characteristics determine {{the quality of the}} model. Kydland and Prescott (1982) offered no formal evaluation of their model, but noted how variables like hours worked did not match real data well while the variances of other elements of the model did. When estimation methods are used, models are evaluated based on standard statistical goodness of fit criteria. Calibration is generally associated with real <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> modelers of the new classical school, but methodological differences cut across ideology. While Lucas, Prescott, and Kydland are calibration advocates, another prominent new classical, Sargent, favors estimation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} mid-2000s, Greece's economy {{was one of}} the fastest growing in the eurozone and was {{associated}} with a large structural deficit. As the world economy was hit by the financial crisis of 2007–08, Greece was hit especially hard because its main industries—shipping and tourism—were especially sensitive to changes in the <b>business</b> <b>cycle.</b> The government spent heavily to keep the economy functioning and the country's debt increased accordingly.|$|E
5|$|The leading Western economies adopted Keynes's policy {{recommendations}} before {{the outbreak of}} World War II, and in the two decades following Keynes's death in 1946, almost all capitalist governments had done so. Keynes's influence waned in the 1970s, {{partly as a result}} of the stagflation that plagued the Anglo-American economies during that decade, and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by Milton Friedman and other monetarists. He and other economists had disputed the ability of government to regulate the <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> favourably with fiscal policy.|$|E
5|$|The National Bureau of Economic Research dates recessions on {{a monthly}} basis back to 1854; {{according}} to their chronology, from 1854 to 1919, there were 16 cycles. The average recession lasted 22 months, and the average expansion 27. From 1919 to 1945, there were six cycles; recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35. From 1945 to 2001, and 10 cycles, recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months. This has prompted some economists to declare that the <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> has become less severe. Factors that may have contributed to this moderation include the creation of a central bank and lender of last resort, like the Federal Reserve System in 1913, the establishment of deposit insurance {{in the form of the}} Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933, increased regulation of the banking sector, the adoption of interventionist Keynesian economics, and the increase in automatic stabilizers in the form of government programs (unemployment insurance, social security, and later Medicare and Medicaid). See Post-World War II economic expansion for further discussion.|$|E
40|$|The latest {{research}} highlights {{the existence of}} the asymmetry of the volatility of <b>business</b> <b>cycles.</b> In this context, in this paper we firstly aim to test whether the volatility of <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> in Romania is constant or not and then, according to the identified result we try to model it. For the determination of <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> of Romania we use the index of the industrial production registered during the period January 2000 – May 2011. The estimation of the <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> is conducted by means of the Hodrick-Prescot filter. The results obtained confirm that the volatility of <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> of Romania is not constant and suggest the possibility of taking into account the heteroscedastic models.

5|$|The new {{classical}} school {{culminated in}} real <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> theory (RBC). Like early classical economic models, RBC models assumed that markets clear and that business cycles {{are driven by}} changes in technology and supply, not demand. New Keynesians tried to address many of the criticisms leveled by Lucas and other new classical economists against Neo-Keynesians. New Keynesians adopted rational expectations and built models with microfoundations of sticky prices that suggested recessions could still be explained by demand factors because rigidities stop prices from falling to a market-clearing level, leaving a surplus of goods and labor. The new neoclassical synthesis combined elements of both new classical and new Keynesian macroeconomics into a consensus. Other economists avoided the new classical and new Keynesian debate on short-term dynamics and developed the new growth theories of long-run economic growth. The Great Recession led to a retrospective {{on the state of}} the field and some popular attention turned toward heterodox economics.|$|E
