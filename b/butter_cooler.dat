5000|$|On the {{occasion}} of Capt. Gill's retirement, a complete solid silver breakfast and tea service; manufactured by Joseph Mayer of Liverpool,and which consisted of a full-sized coffee-pot, tea pot, sugar basin and cream jug; a silver chased toast rack, four very richly-chased candlesticks, a silver <b>butter</b> <b>cooler</b> with cover and stand, 12 silver teaspoons, sugar tongs and two very elegant butter kniveswere presented to Capt. Gill at a dinner held in is honour at the Castle Mona, Douglas, Isle of Man on Wednesday June 16, 1852.In addition Capt. Gill also received a purse of 100 sovereigns. On {{the top of the}} coffee and tea pots were two emblems, one representing that for the sailing vessels, being formed of a rudder, sail, and block grouped together, the other consisting of a large paddle wheel, funnel and steering-wheel.On the coffee pot was inscribed, under the figure of a yacht, the names of the sailing vessels commanded by Captain Gill, and under a steam vessel the names of the Mona's Isle, Queen of the Isle, King Orry, Ben-my-Chree and Tynwald, the steamers which had been under his charge. In addition to the silver articles there were three handsome papier mache waiters and a complete service of china in white and rich gold. The silver article, had the initials W. G. upon them, with the principal inscription [...] "To Captain William Gill, the discoverer of the Victoria Channel into Liverpool."In this manner, therefore, did Liverpool express gratitude for the new Channel.|$|E
50|$|Most buttercreams {{can be left}} at room {{temperature}} without melting. Buttercreams made with shortening and a higher sugar content withstand warmer temperatures better than those made solely with <b>butter.</b> <b>Cooling</b> buttercream causes it to harden. If a frosted cake is cooled, the buttercream may crack.|$|R
60|$|Beyond was a pantry with well filled {{shelves and}} then the kitchen--this last filled with every article that could {{possibly}} be needed. In a store-room were enough provisions to stock a grocery-store and Patsy noted with amazement that there was ice in the refrigerator, with cream and milk and <b>butter</b> <b>cooling</b> beside it.|$|R
60|$|This {{passed as}} the two ladies were {{entering}} the house and preparing for the evening meal. The table {{was placed in the}} bay of the open window, and looked very inviting, the little silver tea-pot steaming beside the two quaint china cups, the small crisp twists of bread, the <b>butter</b> <b>cool</b> in ice-plant leaves, and some fresh fruit blushing in a pretty basket. The Holt was a region of Paradise to Phoebe Fulmort; and glee shone upon her sweet face, though it was very quiet enjoyment, as the summer breeze played softly round her cheeks and danced with a merry little spiral that had detached itself from her glossy folds of light hair.|$|R
25|$|Double Stuf Oreo (introduced in 1974) {{have about}} twice the normal amount of white creme filling. Available in peanut <b>butter,</b> original, <b>cool</b> mint, {{chocolate}} creme, and birthday cake. In the UK they are called Double Stuff Oreo (note the double 'f') and are currently only available in original.|$|R
25|$|Madidah Balah (مديدة بلح) is a date pudding. The {{dates are}} boiled until they thicken and {{subsequently}} are let to <b>cool.</b> <b>Butter</b> {{can be added}} on top.|$|R
50|$|It is {{produced}} from cocoa beans {{that have been}} fermented, dried, roasted, and separated from their skins. The beans are ground into cocoa mass (cocoa paste). The mass is melted to become the liquor, and the liquor is either separated into cocoa solids and cocoa <b>butter,</b> or <b>cooled</b> and molded into blocks of raw chocolate. Its main use (often with additional cocoa butter) is in making chocolate.|$|R
40|$|A {{range of}} methods, mainly X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), {{have been used}} to characterise the {{polymorphism}} of fats in food products. As sugars present in chocolate have a significant XRD pattern, partially overlapping with the signal of cocoa butter, XRD cannot be applied directly to chocolate. In this paper, the XRD signal of a molten sample, similar to the one for pure sucrose, was subtracted from the signal of a solid sample of chocolate to remove the impact of the crystallised sugar. The XRD patterns obtained were compared with the pattern of cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>cooled</b> under the same conditions. Strong peaks were observed at similar inter lamellar d spacings showing that the polymorphic state of cocoa butter in processed chocolate could be obtained using this method. Numerical integration of the peaks also allowed quantification of the degree of crystallinity present in the system during a typical process. The accuracy of the method developed was found to be dependent on the (cocoa butter) /(sugar) ratio in the chocolate used...|$|R
50|$|The bottles {{are then}} {{taken to the}} Buttercross (a conical {{structure}} with a sphere on top, used for keeping <b>butter</b> and cheese <b>cool</b> when the village was a market town) on the village green to be dressed with ribbons. Here, the penny loaves are distributed to the crowd.|$|R
60|$|Upon this, the {{old woman}} cleared the little table, {{went out of the}} room, and quickly {{returned}} with a tray on which was a dish of little rusks and a small precise pat of <b>butter,</b> <b>cool,</b> symmetrical, white, and plump. The old man who had been standing by the door in one attitude during the whole interview, looking at the mother up-stairs as he had looked at the son down-stairs, went out at the same time, and, after a longer absence, returned with another tray on which was the greater part of a bottle of port wine (which, to judge by his panting, he had brought from the cellar), a lemon, a sugar-basin, and a spice box. With these materials and the aid of the kettle, he filled a tumbler with a hot and odorous mixture, measured out and compounded with as much nicety as a physician's prescription. Into this mixture Mrs Clennam dipped certain of the rusks, and ate them; while {{the old woman}} buttered certain other of the rusks, which were to be eaten alone. When the invalid had eaten all the rusks and drunk all the mixture, the two trays were removed; and the books and the candle, watch, handkerchief, and spectacles were replaced upon the table. She then put on the spectacles and read certain passages aloud from a book--sternly, fiercely, wrathfully--praying that her enemies (she made them by her tone and manner expressly hers) might be put {{to the edge of the}} sword, consumed by fire, smitten by plagues and leprosy, that their bones might be ground to dust, and that they might be utterly exterminated. As she read on, years seemed to fall away from her son like the imaginings of a dream, and all the old dark horrors of his usual preparation for the sleep of an innocent child to overshadow him.|$|R
60|$|This {{small lake}} was of most {{value as a}} {{neighbor}} in the intervals of a gentle rain-storm in August, when, both air and water being perfectly still, but the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of evening, and the wood thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to shore. A lake like this is never smoother than at such a time; and the clear portion of the air above it being, shallow and darkened by clouds, the water, full of light and reflections, becomes a lower heaven itself so much the more important. From a hill-top near by, where the wood had been recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across the pond, through a wide indentation in the hills which form the shore there, where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley, but stream there was none. That way I looked between and over the near green hills to some distant and higher ones in the horizon, tinged with blue. Indeed, by standing on tiptoe I could {{catch a glimpse of}} some of the peaks of the still bluer and more distant mountain ranges in the northwest, those true-blue coins from heaven's own mint, and also of some portion of the village. But in other directions, even from this point, I could not see over or beyond the woods which surrounded me. It is well to have some water in your neighborhood, to give buoyancy to and float the earth. One value even of the smallest well is, that when you look into it you see that earth is not continent but insular. This is as important as that it keeps <b>butter</b> <b>cool.</b> When I looked across the pond from this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in time of flood I distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley, like a coin in a basin, all the earth beyond the pond appeared like a thin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet of interverting water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was but dry land.|$|R
5000|$|The devil {{recalls the}} time when Tom met a female cat on the beach, leading to a {{flashback}} of 1947's Salt Water Tabby, where Jerry's interference embarrassed Tom, and led to Tom shooting Jerry into the sea through a fizzy cola bottle. The devil then reminds Jerry of {{the time when}} Tom invited a girlfriend of his over for a meal in 1945's The Mouse Comes to Dinner, where Jerry was forced to serve the food and blow Tom's soup. The frustrated mouse spit Tom's soup in his face, which caused Tom to place the spoon that Jerry was standing on directly above a candle flame, which burned Jerry's bottom and feet, launching the mouse into a block of <b>butter</b> to <b>cool</b> off ("Hehehe! That was a hot one!"). After that, Jerry's reminded of the time Tom {{fell in love with a}} cowgirl in 1950's Texas Tom (though the devil admittedly says [...] "Not that anything was wrong with her"). Tom confidently strode up to the cat and smoked a roll-up cigarette (with Jerry's [...] "help"), which blew out the word [...] "Howdy" [...] in smoke.|$|R
60|$|The {{figure of}} a woman who held her hooded shawl under her chin, stole with steps often checked through the limp, dew-laden grass of the woods-pasture and slipped on the rotting logs. But she caught herself from tumbling, and safely gained the border of Gillespie's corn field. There she sat down {{trembling}} on the stone doorstep of the spring-house, and waited rather than rested in the shelter of the chestnut boughs that overhung the roof. She was aware of the spring gurgling under the stone on its way into the sunshine, from the crocks of cream-covered milk and of <b>butter</b> in the <b>cool</b> dark of the hut; she sensed the thick August heat of the sun already smiting its honeyed odors from the corn; she heard the scamper of the squirrels preying upon the ripening ears, and whisking {{in and out of the}} woods or dropping into the field from the tips of the boughs overhanging the nearer rows; but it all came blurred to her consciousness.|$|R
50|$|French buttercream is {{made with}} whipped egg yolks not French {{meringue}} as is sometimes assumed. It is prepared {{in the same way}} as Italian meringue-based buttercream, except egg yolks (some versions use whole eggs or a combination of the two) are used in place of the egg whites—a hot sugar syrup which has reached the soft-ball stage is beaten into the egg yolks which have been beaten until they are thick and pale yellow. The syrup and egg yolk mixture is further whipped until it has formed a light foam and has <b>cooled.</b> <b>Butter</b> and flavorings (extracts, oils, or juices) are then whipped in. This icing is very rich, smooth, and light. French buttercream tends to melt faster than other buttercreams due to the high content of fat from the egg yolks and butter. This type of buttercream is best suited for use as a filling or an icing, but not for decorations.|$|R
40|$|Butter {{keeping quality}} and pallet {{physical}} stability during {{transport and storage}} are dependent on the temperature distribution through the product. Understanding these temperature changes are of vital importance for the dairy industry with regard to butter manufacture, storage and shipping. Three dimensional mathematical models of heat transfer were developed to predict thawing and freezing in butter products. These models require accurate thermophysical data as an input. Specific heat capacity and enthalpy of butter with different composition was measured using Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The specific heat capacity of <b>butter</b> differs for <b>cooling</b> and heating operations due to significant supercooling and delayed crystallization of the fat fraction of butter at temperatures well below the equilibrium phase change temperature during cooling. This reduces the heat capacity for cooling relative to that for heating. Thawing of individual blocks of butter was accurately predicted by the conduction only model (no mass transfer limitations) with equilibrium thermal properties giving accurate predictions when the butter was completely frozen before thawing. For partially frozen butter the conduction model with the measured temperature dependent specific heat capacity data for unfrozen butter including melting {{of some of the}} fat fraction gave accurate predictions. For freezing it was observed that water in the butter supercools many degrees below its initial freezing point before freezing due to its water in oil structure. Experiments suggested that during freezing release of latent heat observed as a temperature rebound is controlled as much by the rate of crystallisation of water in each of the water droplets as by the rate of heat transfer. A conduction only model including water crystallization kinetics based on the Avrami Model predicted freezing in butter successfully. Simple models with equilibrium thermal properties and nucleation only kinetics (based on homogenous nucleation theory) or the sensible heat only model (no release of latent heat) gave poor predictions. The models for individual blocks were extended to predict heat transfer in butter pallets. A butter pallet contains product, packaging material and the air entrapped between the packaging and butter cartons. Measurements were made for freezing and thawing of full and half pallets at a commercial storage facility and in the University laboratory. Thawing and freezing in wrapped tightly stacked pallets was predicted accurately by the conduction only model with effective thermal properties (incorporating butter, packaging and air) estimated by the parallel model. For unwrapped tightly stacked or loosely stacked pallets there is potential for air flow between the adjacent cartons of butter. An alternative approach was developed which consisted of modeling the pallet on block by block basis using effective heat transfer coefficients for each surface. Different heat transfer coefficients were used on different faces of the blocks depending on the location of the block in the pallet. This approach gave good predictions for both unwrapped tightly stacked and loosely stacked pallets using the estimated effective heat transfer coefficients from the measured data. Further experimental and/or modelling work is required in order to develop guidelines for estimating effective heat transfer coefficient values for internal block face for industrial scenarios...|$|R
