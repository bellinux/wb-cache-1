25|$|Air {{brakes on}} the train are {{supplied}} with air from a compressor on each locomotive. When a locomotive is shut off, the compressor no longer supplies the brake system with air. An air brake pipe connects to each car and locomotive {{on the train}}. When air leaks from the various components, the air pressure drops. If {{the system is not}} recharged with air, the locomotive air brakes will become ineffective and provide no braking force. When the air <b>brake</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> sense a drop in pressure in the brake pipe, they are designed to activate the brakes on each car. However, if the rate of leakage is slow and steady, the automatic brakes may not be applied {{as in the case of}} the Lac-Mégantic accident. The train had locomotives that could automatically restart the air-brake system in the event of a brake failure, provided that these locomotives were not shut down as they would be. Also, the TSB found that the “reset safety control” on the lead locomotive was not wired to set the entire train’s brakes in the event of an engine failure.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{train braking}} systems use {{pneumatic}} <b>valves</b> to <b>control</b> and generate <b>brake</b> applications on the cars {{along the length}} of the train. In general, this conventional system consists of a brake pipe that runs the length of the train which supplies air to reservoirs mounted on each of the cars. When the brake pipe and car components are charged with air, the brakes release. When the engineer needs to make a <b>brake</b> application, <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> in the locomotive reduce the brake pipe pressure. As the brake pipe pressure reduces, the service portion on each car divert air from their reservoirs to their brake cylinders. To release the brakes, the engineer charges the brake pipe. This method of <b>controlling</b> the <b>brakes</b> on freight and passenger cars has been virtually the same since its invention by George Westinghouse in 1868.|$|R

This provides between four and seven braking levels, depending on the class of train. It also allows for faster brake application, as the electrical control signal is propagated effectively instantly to all vehicles in the train, whereas the change in air pressure which activates the brakes in a conventional system can take several seconds or tens of seconds to propagate fully {{to the rear of}} the train.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of brake application delays in Australian train brake systems {{began with a}} literature review of pneumatic train braking systems. Data located in the review gave examples of brake application delays of pre 1990 designs from the U. K., India and North America. Information on application delays on later Australian designs was scarce. Reading of literature has shown {{a difference between the}} Australian and North American <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> in the way the propagation of the pressure reduction rate in the brake pipe is maintained. <b>Control</b> <b>valves</b> of the North American style allow the brake pipe air to be connected for a short time to a small cavity or quick service volume of each valve. The quick service volume is then released to atmosphere. The action of exhausting a small amount of air from the brake pipe helps to ensure a propagation of an adequate pressure reduction rate as it travels to the next <b>valve.</b> Australian <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> rely on the ratio of the volume of <b>brake</b> pipe between <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> {{and the size of the}} quick service volume or bulb to ensure the propagation of an adequate pressure reduction as it travels to the next valve. The air in a bulb of an Australian valve is not expelled to atmosphere until a brake release is made. The research explored possible reductions in application delays by utilizing an experimental pipe test rack that included 4 <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> and 120 meters of brake pipe. Experiments with different configurations of exhaust orifices or chokes, valves and branch pipe lengths that supplied the valves gave a record acquired by data acquisition of the timing of each valve and the local pressure drop from a valve or each valve for comparison. Experiments with exhaust chokes that gave a reduction drop rate in the brake pipe that approached the minimum required to operate a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> resulted in instability of the application operation of the <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> The quick service volume of different sizes was included in the experiments to give comparisons in the propagation of the pressure reduction toward the end of a long train. Further increases into the size of the bulb of a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> to enhance the propagation features toward the end of a long train are discussed. The branch pipe with different diameters from 12 mm to 20 mm and lengths from 160 mm to 800 mm when fitted to an adaptor pipe bracket were investigated and results show that larger diameters gave larger gulps in the brake pipe. Other components that were studied included the pipe bracket that is fitted on some <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> The pipe bracket and isolation cock was found to add 282 mm of additional length to the air path and while not changing the operation of the valve, the results showed a smaller drop in local pressure in the brake pipe to assist the pressure reduction rate than shown in valves without pipe brackets...|$|R

40|$|Surge is an {{aerodynamic}} flow instability {{which can}} lead to the catastrophic failure of the compressor sys-tem. One way to cope with this compressor flow instability is active control. For a laboratory-scale gas turbine installation, an active surge control system is proposed which consists of a plenum pressure sensor and a bleedhecycle valve. This work focuses on the selection of a <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> More specifically, the required bandwidth and capacity of the valve are specified. To study the influence of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on system behavior, simulations are done with the Greitzer model which describes the behavior of the nonlinear compression system during surge. This model is extended with a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> model which accounts for the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics and the effect of valve saturation. A linear static output feedback controller is used to stabilize the compression system around its nominal operating point. The main contributions of this study are the following. First, a systematic approach is presented to deter-mine the required bandwidth and capacity of a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for active surge control. Second, an efficient control strategy is applied: one-sided control. In this control strategy, the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is nominally closed and only opens to stabilize the system in its nominal operating point. Third, a stability analysis of the constrained linearized compression system is presented. Using the bounded static output feedback controller, surge limit cycles are stabilized in the nominal operat-ing point. Stable operation can be sustained in this point with zero <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> mass flow if disturbances are absent. From simulations, the minimal bandwidth and capacity of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> needed for stabi-lization are determined. Surge point mass flow is seen to reduce by approximately 15 % with the applied one-sided control strategy. Furthermore, it is concluded that nonlinear flow curves of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> are unfavorable for active surge control...|$|R

When the pH dropped below the set point, the flue gas <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> would close and another <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> would open, allowing air in the head space to be recirculated, preventing CO 2 in the head space from venting from the system. The third <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> {{was used as a}} relief valve to prevent the feed tank from becoming pressurized as flue gas was added to the system.

There were six oil <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> on the system, including a lube oil pressure <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> one flow <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on the inlet end of the compressor, another flow <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on the discharge end, two differential pressure controllers to maintain differential pressure on the seals for {{each end of the}} compressor, as well as a back pressure <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for the oil system.
