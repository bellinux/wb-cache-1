Once LEMS is diagnosed, investigations such as a CT scan of the chest are usually performed to identify any possible underlying lung tumors. Around 50–60% of these are discovered immediately after the diagnosis of LEMS. The remainder is diagnosed later, but usually within two years and typically within four years. As a result, scans are typically repeated every six months {{for the first two}} years after diagnosis. While CT of the lungs is usually adequate, a positron emission tomography scan of the body may also <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> to search for an occult tumour, particularly of the lung.|$|E
