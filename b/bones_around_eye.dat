50|$|Touted {{by some as}} {{a future}} Hall of Famer, his career was {{permanently}} altered on April 8, 1984, when he was hit in the face by Mike Torrez's fastball. The pitch broke the orbital <b>bone</b> <b>around</b> his left <b>eye</b> and ended his 1984 season. He returned in 1985, but suffered from problems with depth perception that permanently hampered his potential. In 1991, Thon received the Tony Conigliaro Award in recognition of his recovery from this severe injury.|$|R
50|$|Boucha {{was drafted}} in the 2nd Round, 16th overall by the Detroit Red Wings in the 1971 NHL Entry Draft (he was also drafted first overall by the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the rival World Hockey Association but chose not to defect to the WHA). Boucha scored a goal in his first NHL game after the Olympics and was voted Detroit {{rookie of the year}} in his first full NHL season. The Red Wings sent him to the Minnesota North Stars in {{exchange}} for Danny Grant in 1974. Boucha was enjoying a solid year in his home state; on January 4, 1975, he was assaulted in a highly publicized stick incident by Dave Forbes of the Boston Bruins. The attack left Boucha with a cracked <b>bone</b> <b>around</b> his <b>eye</b> and blurred vision. Forbes was prosecuted for aggravated assault. His trial resulted in a hung jury.|$|R
50|$|Anshunsaurus was {{a marine}} reptile {{with a long}} neck, slender skull, and long, paddle-like tail. In {{comparison}} to its long trunk, the limbs are very small. Anshunsaurus {{is characterized by a}} long jugal bone in the skull, fused postorbital and postfrontal <b>bones</b> <b>around</b> the <b>eyes,</b> a maxilla that forms part of the margin of the eye socket, a humerus with large crests, and a large fibula. The type species of Ansunsaurus, A. huangguoshuensis, was named in 1999 from the Ladinian or Carnian age Falang Formation in Guanling County. Although several complete skeletons are known, most specimens are crushed in either dorsal (top) or ventral (bottom) view. The holotype of A. huangguoshuensis, IVPP V11835, is preserved in dorsal view while a second specimen, IVPP V11834, is preserved in ventral view. Based on these specimens, A. huangguoshuensis grew to about 3.5 m in length. Although the tip is not preserved in any specimen, the tail made up {{at least half of the}} animal's length.|$|R
5|$|Strepsirrhines {{are defined}} by their wet nose or rhinarium. They also have a smaller brain than comparably sized simians, large {{olfactory}} lobes for smell, a vomeronasal organ to detect pheromones, and a bicornuate uterus with an epitheliochorial placenta. Their eyes contain a reflective layer to improve their night vision, and their eye sockets include a ring of <b>bone</b> <b>around</b> the <b>eye,</b> but they lack a wall of thin bone behind it. Strepsirrhine primates produce their own vitamin C, whereas haplorhine primates must obtain it from their diets. Lemuriform primates are characterized by a toothcomb, a specialized set of teeth in the front, {{lower part of the}} mouth mostly used for combing fur during grooming. Often, the toothcomb is incorrectly used to characterize all strepsirrhines. Instead, it is unique to lemuriforms and is not seen among adapiforms. Lemuriforms groom orally, and also possess a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot for scratching in areas that are inaccessible to the mouth and tongue. It is unclear whether adapiforms possessed grooming claws.|$|R
50|$|Masiakasaurus were small-bodied ceratosaurs {{that grew}} up to around 1.8 to 2 m in length. The most {{distinctive}} characteristic of Masiakasaurus is the forward-projecting, or procumbent, front teeth. The teeth are heterodont, meaning that they have different shapes along the jaw. The first four dentary teeth of the lower jaw project forward, with the first tooth angled only 10° from horizontal. These teeth are long and spoon-shaped with hooked edges. They have carinae, or sharp edges, that are weakly serrated. Serrations are more evident in the posterior teeth, which are also recurved and laterally compressed. The margin of the dentary curves downward so that the tooth sockets of the front teeth are directed forward. The front teeth of the upper jaw are also procumbent, and {{the margin of the}} premaxilla curves slightly upward to direct them outward.Unlike the skulls of abelisaurids, which are very deep, the skull of Masiakasaurus is long and low. The lacrimal and postorbital <b>bones</b> <b>around</b> the <b>eye</b> are textured with bumpy projections. Not including the highly modified jaws and teeth, the skull of Masiakasaurus possesses many general ceratosaurian characteristics. Overall, its morphology is intermediate between abelisaurids and more basal ceratosaurs.|$|R
50|$|Taylor's {{brilliant}} {{hand and}} foot speed and boxing abilities gave him the early advantage, allowing him to begin building a large lead on points. He frequently hit Chávez with dazzling combinations and danced around the other man, {{making it difficult for}} Chávez, a skilled combination puncher who relied on an accumulation of damage to knock out his foes, to land more than one blow at a time. However rather than become discouraged Chávez remained relentless in his pursuit of Taylor and due to his greater punching power Chávez made sure that Taylor had to pay a terrible toll in order to win rounds. Coming into the later rounds, Taylor was bleeding from the mouth, his entire face was swollen, the <b>bones</b> <b>around</b> his <b>eye</b> socket had been broken, he had swallowed a considerable amount of his own blood, and as he grew tired, Taylor was increasingly forced into exchanging blows with Chávez, which only gave Chávez a greater chance to cause damage. While there was little doubt that Taylor had solidly won the first three quarters of the fight, the question at hand was whether he would survive the final quarter, especially {{after the end of the}} 11th round when Taylor was so dazed that he nearly went into Chávez' corner between rounds, until referee Richard Steele directed him back to his own.|$|R
5000|$|Solid form in {{the first}} 10 weeks of the Broncos season earned Thaiday {{a spot on the}} Queensland bench for game one of the 2006 State of Origin series. He was also {{selected}} on the bench for the following two games for the Maroons, who {{went on to win the}} series. After that, when the Broncos were in the [...] "slump that wasn't a slump", coach Wayne Bennett moved Thaiday from the bench to the starting side. This, among other changes, saw the Broncos' season turn around, and they ended up winning the 2006 NRL Grand Final. Thaiday was selected for his international debut for the Australian national team in Game 2 of the 2006 Tri-Nations against New Zealand after concussion ruled Willie Mason out.As 2006 NRL Premiers, the Brisbane Broncos travelled to England to face 2006 Super League champions, St Helens R.F.C. in the 2007 World Club Challenge. Thaiday played from the interchange bench in the Broncos' 14-18 loss.In the 2007 NRL season Thaiday suffered an injury to the <b>bone</b> <b>around</b> his <b>eye</b> socket and missed all three games of the 2007 State of Origin series for the Queensland Maroons while waiting to recover. He made his 50th first grade appearance in the NRL in 2007 and re-signed with the Broncos until the end of 2009.|$|R
2500|$|An {{example of}} a style matchup was the {{historical}} fight of Julio César Chávez, a swarmer or in-fighter, against Meldrick Taylor, the boxer or out-fighter (see Julio César Chávez vs. Meldrick Taylor). The match was nicknamed [...] "Thunder Meets Lightning" [...] as an allusion to punching power of Chávez and blinding speed of Taylor. Chávez was the epitome of the [...] "Mexican" [...] style of boxing. Taylor's hand and foot speed and boxing abilities gave him the early advantage, allowing him to begin building a large lead on points. Chávez remained relentless in his pursuit of Taylor and due to his greater punching power Chávez slowly punished Taylor. Coming into the later rounds, Taylor was bleeding from the mouth, his entire face was swollen, the <b>bones</b> <b>around</b> his <b>eye</b> socket had been broken, he had swallowed {{a considerable amount of}} his own blood, and as he grew tired, Taylor was increasingly forced into exchanging blows with Chávez, which only gave Chávez a greater chance to cause damage. While there was little doubt that Taylor had solidly won the first three quarters of the fight, the question at hand was whether he would survive the final quarter. Going into the final round, Taylor held a secure lead on the scorecards of two of the three judges. Chávez would have to knock Taylor out to claim a victory, whereas Taylor merely needed {{to stay away from the}} Mexican legend. However, Taylor did not stay away, but continued to trade blows with Chávez. As he did so, Taylor showed signs of extreme exhaustion, and every tick of the clock brought Taylor closer to victory unless Chávez could knock him out.|$|R
30|$|Clinically, as {{affordable}} as the strain, bone regeneration is configured, {{whereas the}} over-stimulation leads to adverse effects [40]. The <b>bone</b> <b>around</b> unloaded implants showed a low mineral density index. [41] The process of inducing more dense bone depends {{mainly on the}} loading protocol conducted [42]. The peri-implant <b>bone</b> <b>around</b> progressively loaded implants illustrated minimal crestal bone loss than the <b>bone</b> <b>around</b> implants placed conventionally, and the later cited extended increase in peri-implant bone density by time [10]. Based on radiological assessment, Barone et al. [43] stated statistical significant dense <b>bone</b> <b>around</b> immediate rather than unloaded oral implants.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, the Chapmans gave Smarty Jones to John Servis for training. They {{sold the}} Someday Farm {{property}} {{and moved into}} a smaller home, training only four horses. On July 27, 2003, Servis was schooling Smarty Jones at the starting gate when the colt spooked, reared, and smashed {{his head on the}} top of the gate. He fell to the ground unconscious, blood pouring from his nostrils. Servis thought the horse was dead, but Smarty Jones regained consciousness and was treated by Dr. Dan Hanf, who stopped the hemorrhaging and treated him for shock. After the bleeding stopped, the colt's head began to swell from the middle of his forehead over to his left eye. Dr. Hanf and assistant trainer Maureen Donnelly kept watch on the horse and kept him at the barn overnight. Hanf had seen the eye before the swelling and was confident the eye itself was not damaged but knew the horse must have sustained a fracture due to the excessive swelling. The colt was sent the next day, July 28, 2003, to the New Jersey Equine Clinic for x-rays. There he was diagnosed with a fractured skull. The <b>bones</b> <b>around</b> his left <b>eye</b> were so badly damaged that the veterinarians thought they might have to remove the eye. Smarty Jones overcame his injuries after three weeks in the hospital and spent more than a month recuperating on the farm. Two of the other entrants in the 2004 Kentucky Derby lacked sight in one eye, and Smarty Jones could have been the third.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is {{important}} to obtain mechanical coupling between dental implants and bone, because the lack of mechanical coupling may cause <b>bone</b> loss <b>around</b> implants. In this research, a new cylindrical dental implant composed of three parts was designed to offer favored mechanical environment for the bone. A special gap structure changed {{the means of the}} stress transmission and decreased the stress in the cortical <b>bone</b> <b>around</b> the neck of the implant. Through finite element analysis (FEA) of stress distribution in <b>bone</b> <b>around</b> implant-bone interface, the advantages of this new implant (reducing stress concentration in cervical cortex and satisfying varieties of clinical needs) were verified. The peak stress for the new design was about 30 percent less than that of the traditional implant and the flexibility of the design was also confirmed by changing the gap depth and the wall thickness...|$|R
