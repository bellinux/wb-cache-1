30|$|Doping {{with the}} first group {{elements}} like Li, Na, K, and Cs in ZnO would substitute Zn 2 + by the monovalent cations, thus {{making it possible to}} realize n-type conduction. The realization of n-type conduction is very important for ZnO applications in optoelectronic devices, and there are reports on the electrical property of the first group element-doped ZnO thin-films [32 – 36]. Various techniques such as pulsed laser deposition [37, 38], magnetron sputtering [39, 40], and molecular beam epitaxy [41] have been used to deposit thin-films of ZnO. The sol-gel method [42] has been receiving increased attention because of its many advantages such as low cost, simple deposition procedure, easier composition control, low processing temperature, and easier fabrication of large area films. Therefore, here, we demonstrate the improved performance of P 3 HT:PCBM and P 3 HT:ICBA-based inverted bulk-heterojunction solar cells through the appropriate interface modification by Cs 2 CO 3 -doped ZnO on the electron collecting ITO interface. Recently, Yang et al. has reported that a solution-processed Cs 2 CO 3 is able to make interface dipoles layer on ITO. One may say that these two entities (ZnO and Cs 2 CO 3) are completely different {{but the most important thing}} is that these entities do improve the performance of the device. Moreover, we have seen a number of works on tuning the work function of ITO by adding an electron transport layer such as ZnO [43], TiO 2 [44 – 46], Cs 2 CO 3 [44 – 46], and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) [47]. The created dipole moment helps to reduce the work function of ITO, allowing ITO to serve as the cathode. The improved device performance is due to the reduction of series resistance, improved shunt performance, and enhanced open-circuit voltage of the cell which can be attributed to the improvement of the following aspects: (1) reduction of the contact resistance between the ZnO:Cs 2 CO 3 and active organic layer, (2) enhancement of the electronic coupling between inorganic ZnO:Cs 2 CO 3 and active organic layer to mediate better forward charge transfer and reduce <b>back</b> <b>charge</b> recombination at the interface, and (3) affect the upper organic layer growth mode and morphology.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{emitting}} push-pull triarylamine derivatives, models of their widely used homologues in photonics and organic electronics, was investigated by steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy. Their structural originality {{stems from the}} sole change of the electron-withdrawing substituent X (-H: 1, -CN: 2, -NO 2 : 3, -CHC(CN) 2 : 4), giving rise to efficient emission tuning from blue to red upon increasing the X electron-withdrawing character. All compounds are highly fluorescent in alkanes. The more polar compounds 2 - 4 undergo considerable Stokes shift and emission quenching in polar solvents. Femtosecond transient absorption data allowed us to identify {{the nature of the}} emissive state which varies {{as a function of the}} compound and surrounding polarity. A long-lived ππ* excited state with weak charge transfer character was found for 1. This excited state evolves into a long-lived ICT state with red-shifted emission for 2 in polar solvents. For 3 and 4, the ICT state is directly populated in all solvents. Long-lived and emissive in n -hexane, it relaxes in toluene to a new ICT′ conformation with stronger charge transfer character and enhanced Stokes shift. In more polar THF, ethanol, and nitrile solvents, ICT relaxes to a dark excited state ICT′′ with viscosity-dependent kinetics (3 in THF, 8. 5 ps in butyronitrile, 1. 9 ps in acetonitrile), denoting an efficient radiationless deactivation to the ground state (<b>back</b> <b>charge</b> transfer). This result reveals a very small S 0 -S 1 energy gap at the relaxed ICT′′ geometry, with a possible close-lying S 0 -S 1 conical intersection, which suggests that the ICT → ICT′′ process results from a structural change involving a large-amplitude molecular distortion. This fast structural change can account for the strong fluorescence quenching observed for 3 and 4 in polar solvents. Finally, the magnitude of intersystem crossing between the singlet and triplet excited states largely depends on the electron-deficient X unit and the solvent itself. These observations help one conclude on the prevailing role played by the electron-withdrawing groups and the surrounding polarity in the photophysical performances of triphenylamine derivatives, largely employed in numerous emissive solid-state devices...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In many {{real-world}} commercial applications, such as electrophotographic printing, the adsorption {{of water}} on critical surfaces has an overwhelming but poorly understood effect on the desired materials performance. This work is focussed {{to better understand the}} effect {{of water on}} the triboelectric charge transfer between surfaces in xerography. Molecular mechanics was used to find the most probably water adsorption sites for isolated polymethylmethacryate (PMMA) and isolated silica models, and for intermolecular complexes between PMMA and silica which are responsible for triboelectric charge transfer. Density functional theory (DFT) was used calculate the local energy minima, the adsorption of water molecules on different surface functional groups, and the analysis of the frontier orbitals, to quantitatively compare the energy gap differences for electronic charge transfer, and thus the effect of the hydration site on PMMA and silica on electronic charge transfer. Four ways were found for surface water adsorption to affect the electronic charge transfer between PMMA and silica: (1) adsorption of a water molecule on the carbonyl group of PMMA decreases the energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) on PMMA, thus making electron charge transfer more difficult because of the transfer barrier increase; (2) a water molecule acts as part of the electron accepter when adsorbed at the active site of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) on silica, which lowers the LUMO and thus lowers the charge transfer barrier, {{but at the same time}} creates a charge dissipation pathway as a part of the charge transfer is now to water, rather than to silica; (3) a water molecule acts as a spacer between PMMA and silica, which increases the energy gap for charge transfer and thus decreases the charge transfer; and (4) water molecules can act as a charge carrier, dissipating electrons by accepting charge when adsorbed on silica and then donating <b>back</b> <b>charge</b> when adsorbed on PMMA. This work provides a detailed mechanistic understanding of the effects of water on the surface electronic structure of amorphous silica and PMMA that are critical to electrophotographic applications, and no doubt to other applications where the surface electronic structure is relevant.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the photophysics of a pyridinium betaine, 2 -pyridin- 1 -yl- 1 H -benzimidazole (SBPa), based on a {{combination}} of steady-state, femtosecond photoionization (gas phase) and femtosecond transient absorption (solution) spectroscopic measurements, supported by (LR) -PCM-(TD) DFT calculations. Preliminary and new electrochemical results have revealed a strongly negative solvatochromic charge transfer (CT) absorption due to a S 0 → S 2 vertical transition and a weakly-solvatochromic emission due to S 1 → S 0 transition. Advanced TDDFT optimizations of the Franck-Condon states S 2 (FC) and S 1 (FC) led to two additional CT levels with planar geometry, S 2 (CT) and S 1 (CT), respectively, allowing prediction of a two-step photoinduced ICT process, i. e., S 0 → S 2 (FC) and S 2 (CT) → S 1 (CT), separated by a S 0 (FC) → S 2 (CT) <b>back</b> <b>charge</b> transfer relaxation. While the pyridinium ring is the acceptor group in both steps, two different donor groups, the benzene ring and the imidazole bridge, are involved in the excitation and internal conversion processes, respectively. Femtosecond transient absorption experiments supported by MCR-ALS decomposition confirmed indeed the contribution of two distinct CT states in the photophysics of SBPa : following excitation to the S 2 (CT) state, ultrafast production of the emissive S 1 state (the only channel observable in the gas phase) was observed to occur in competition with a further ICT process toward the S 1 (CT) state, with a time constant ranging from 300 fs to 20 ps depending on the solvent. While in aprotic media this ICT process was found to be purely solvent controlled (double polarity and viscosity dependency), in protic solvents, the influence of the hydrogen bond network has to be taken into account. Comparison with data obtained for a pre-twisted SBPa analogue led us to exclude the presence of any large-amplitude geometrical change during ICT. Analyzing the solvent dependency using the power law approach, we concluded that the S 1 (CT) state decays essentially through IC in the 3 - 40 ps time range whereas the emissive S 1 state decays within 130 - 260 ps via IC, ISC and fluorescence...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop {{mathematical}} models for electrochemical and photoelectrochemical impedance transfer functions for mixed conducting films. These models include electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) for mixed conducting photoelectrochemical thin films, and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) for mixed conducting microporous thin films. In addition a short study of the step size dependency of the convergence for numerical modeling approach using Newman's BAND(J) subroutine to solve a second order diffusion equation has beed performed. It was found that the derived photoelectrochemical impedance (EIS) transfer function and the intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) transfer function were dependent on the degree of mixed conductivity, while the intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS) transfer function was independent with degree of mixed conductivity. This was explained by the steady-state concentration profiles for the extreme cases of t+= 1 and t+=t-= 0. 5. The concentration at solution interface increases with increasing light intensity when a sufficiently large light adsorption coefficient is assumed. For the pure electrical conducting system (t+= 1), the concentration close to the support is constant. So when the current oscillates, only the concentration close to the solution interface oscillates. For the mixed conducting system (t+= 0. 5), concentration at both the electrode interfaces oscillates. Thus, the electrode kinetics at both interfaces affect the impedance measurements for an applied current density. Under open circuit conditions for IMVS measurements, only the photogenerated charge carriers close to the solution will contribute to the impedance, since the applied current is zero and the transfer function is independent of the transport numbers. Newman's BAND(J) subroutine has been proven to be valid to solve partial differential equations with complex numbers, needed to calculate impedance spectra, in previous work. It was found in this study that the convergence of the BAND(J) subroutine does not follow the expected convergence toward the numerical solution with decreasing step size. One possible source for this unexpected trend was proposed to be that the error related to this numerical approach is dependent on higher derivatives of the solution. It was advised that a Richardson's iteration method study for higher order derivatives should be performed for this routine to find the appropriate error dependency. The electrochemical impedance transfer function for the mixed conducting thin film electrode showed a reflective-like behavior, as expected from previous work. A dome in the low frequency region of the impedance plane plot was observed. The dome occurs at a frequency equal to the effective rate constant k. Thus, this dome corresponds to the charge limiting process of recombination across the bulk electrode. By decreasing the rate constant of recombination, the impedance increases, in accordance with previous work. The photoelectrochemical impedance transfer function for the mixed conducting thin film electrode showed two domes in the impedance plane plot with different imaginary parts in the low frequency region of the impedance spectrum corresponding to two distinct charge transfer limiting processes in opposite directions. It was found that the current associated with charge transfer limiting process oscillating in the same direction as the potential occurred at a frequency equal to the chosen effective rate constant k. Thus, this dome corresponds to the charge limiting process of recombination in the bulk of the electrode material. The current oscillating in the opposite direction of the potential was assumed to be associated with a <b>back</b> <b>charge</b> transfer process between the electrode and the electrolyte, and should be described by the electrode kinetics at the solution interface. In the high frequency region, the system is diffusion limited, and for high light intensities the system shows a reflective-like behavior. The intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) impedance transfer function for the mixed conducting thin film electrode showed one dome in the impedance plane plot. It was found that the dome occurs at a frequency equal to the chosen value for the effective rate constant k. Thus, the dome corresponds to the charge limiting process of recombination across the bulk electrode. For sufficiently low k-values, the system is charge transfer limiting in the low frequency region, and diffusion limiting in the high frequency region. The intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) impedance transfer function for the mixed conducting thin film electrode showed two distinct domes in the impedance plane plot in the same quadrant for large rate constants and applied steady state current densities, corresponding to two different charge limiting processes. It was found that one of the domes occurred at a frequency equal to the chosen value of the effective rate constant k. Thus, this dome corresponds to the charge limiting process of recombination across the electrode. The other dome is assumed to correspond to <b>back</b> <b>charge</b> transfer with the electrolyte, and the rate of the charge transfer should be described by the electrode kinetics at the solution interface. By decreasing the applied current density and increasing the light intensity, a shift in the quadrant of the impedance plane plot was observed. The proposed explanation to this is the competition between recombination and charge generation to keep the potential constant. When the rate of generation exceeds the recombination, the charge transfer at the solution interface changes direction in order to maintain a constant potential. This was investigated in more detail for steady-state conditions, where it was found that for high rate constants the current increases with increasing light intensity to keep a constant potential, in accordance with Fick's first law of diffusion. For low rate constants the current decreases with increasing potential, thus the charge transfer between the electrode and electrolyte changes sign and the net current density is in opposite direction than the light intensity. For intermediate rate constants, a change from increasing to decreasing current with increasing light intensity is observed. This indicates that the recombination process accommodates for the increased current by increasing the light intensity in order to keep the potential constant for low light intensities. At a threshold light intensity, the current density is changing from increasing to decreasing with increasing light intensity, indicating that the recombination cannot accommodate for the increased current by increasing the light intensity to keep the potential constant, and the potential is kept constant by changing the direction of the charge transfer between electrode and electrolyte. The intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) transfer function for the microporous mixed conducting thin film electrode showed a reflective-like behavior, where a charge transfer limiting process in the lower frequency limit and a diffusion controlled process in the high frequency region where observed. The charge limiting process was found to be the recombination process described by the effective rate constant k. The model, however, seemed to break for low rate constants, and a further study of this model was suggested. A limitation of the derived model was that the steady-state concentration under zero light and zero illumination is zero. In previous work, an additive term in the steady-state concentration expression corresponding to the equilibrium concentration was proposed. By including an additive term directly does not fulfill the steady-state diffusion equation as written. One possible solution was proposed, in which the equilibrium concentration is introduced in the diffusion equation, and the diffusion equation is then solved with appropriate boundary conditions. This was suggested to be studied in more detail in further work. </p...|$|E
