40|$|AbstractThe article aims {{to point}} out the mutual {{relations}} between underground mining and its manifestations on the ground surface. For the purpose, churches in the Karviná Region were selected. The <b>buildings</b> <b>have</b> been affected by over 200 -year long extraction of hard coal. Some of the <b>buildings</b> <b>have</b> been influenced {{from the start of the}} mining activities, others later on. Thanks to the combined effects of the historical significance of the monuments and their diversion from the vertical axis, the <b>buildings</b> <b>have</b> become even more interesting. Moreover, they clearly document how the anthropogenic mining activities influence the built-up area. Some of the <b>buildings</b> <b>have</b> been preserved to date, some had to be demolished, unfortunately. Nowadays, the monuments are becoming significant sites of geotourism interest...|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the 2005 {{ownership}} transfer, the structure needed additional renovation. Many of the wooden window frames were rotting, the roof needed repairing, the <b>building</b> <b>had</b> been vandalized, and the structure was suffering from extremes of heat and cold (since it lacked heating). Additionally, the <b>building</b> <b>had</b> little land around it to prevent encroachment. Although the <b>building</b> <b>had</b> a 100 ft right-of-way from the local dirt access road to the front entrance, it lacked easements on the other three sides of the structure.|$|R
50|$|During the {{original}} archaeological digs, this <b>building</b> <b>had</b> been incorrectly interpreted {{as either a}} hotel or seamen's hostel, {{and it was also}} assumed that the building north of here was a brothel, however since then both <b>buildings</b> <b>have</b> been reinterpreted as forming part of {{the original}} fort.|$|R
5|$|A more ancient {{dwelling}} on Shapinsay is the Iron Age Broch of Burroughston. Only {{the interior of}} this partially buried <b>building</b> <b>has</b> been excavated, allowing visitors to look down into the broch from the surrounding mound. The surviving drystone walls rise to about threemetres (10ft) and are more than fourmetres (13ft) thick in some places.|$|E
5|$|After {{a change}} of {{ownership}} in 1950, the cinema was renamed the Stretford Essoldo. It continued to operate as a cinema until 1965, when it was converted into a bingo hall, which it remained until its closure in 1995. The <b>building</b> <b>has</b> been unused since then. It was designated a Grade II listed building in 1994.|$|E
5|$|All the {{buildings}} are interconnected through steps and stairways made in rocks. There are a few rickety wooden bridges along the paths and stairways also to cross over. The temple {{at the highest level}} has a frieze of Buddha. Each <b>building</b> <b>has</b> a balcony, which provides lovely views of the scenic Paro valley down below. The Monasteries have ancient history of occupation by monks, as hermitages.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} churches in St Kilda East, {{with many of}} the modern places of worship serving the Jewish Faith: some older <b>buildings</b> <b>have</b> in earlier times belonged to Christian denominations. Many of these <b>buildings</b> <b>have</b> {{historic}} significance with heritage registration, and often form various religious precincts.|$|R
50|$|Since {{more than}} 85% of the {{destroyed}} <b>buildings</b> <b>had</b> wood shingles, the city quickly passed an ordinance banning them for new construction. By 1931 all older <b>buildings</b> <b>had</b> replaced the wood shingles. In {{the history of}} the city, only Sherman's fire of 1864 did more extensive damage.|$|R
25|$|These <b>buildings</b> <b>have</b> {{currently}} {{been turned}} into projects.|$|R
