50|$|<b>Bitter</b> <b>rot</b> {{is a major}} {{disease in}} the Southeast U.S. in the summer months {{when the weather is}} hot and damp. The {{organism}} has a short incubation period and as a result epidemics of <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> can develop rapidly. The presence of the disease is first indicated by the very small light brown sunken spots beneath the apple skin. As the fungus grows and invades more of the apple tissue, the area becomes engorged until the entire apple is rotted. Around the start of the 20th century Bordeaux mixture was the primary technique for controlling the disease; in the 1940s growers shifted to synthetic chemical use.

40|$|International audienceBitter rot is {{a common}} disease mainly {{affecting}} apples (Malus domestica) worldwide, and resulting in considerable economic losses, but pears can also be affected (Ivic et al. 2013). Most of the reports refer to <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> of Chinese and Asian pears (Pyrus bretschneideri and P. pyrifolia) caused by C. acutatum sensu lato or C. fructicola (Jiang et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2007; Li et al. 2013). To our knowledge, the only report of <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> on European pears (P. communis) was done by Ivic et al. (2013) in Croatia and the causal agent was identified as C. fioriniae. In the last 4 to 5 years, anthracnose symptoms have been repeatedly observed on the pear cultivar Beurré Hardy in September during harvest in an orchard near Brest, France. Lesions were round, 1 to 4 cm in diameter, brown, and dry, with acervuli, producing orange spore masses in concentric rings. Two fungal isolates were obtained (in 2015 and 2016, respectively) from symptomatic pears by culturing necrotic tissue pieces on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 25 °C in the dark. Cultures were light gray, with cottony aerial mycelium becoming darker with age and reverse ranging from brownish pink to dark gray with black spots. Cultures have dark melanized structures similar to acervuli that oozed orange-colored conidia. Conidia were cylindrical to fusiform, pointed at one or both ends, and measured 10. 0 to 14. 0 μm × 3. 0 to 3. 5 μm. Both cultural and morphological characteristics {{were similar to those}} described for C. acutatum sensu lato (Damm et al. 2012). Total genomic DNA was extracted and the rDNA ITS region was amplified using universal primers ITS 4 and ITS 5 then sequenced. For both isolates (UBOCC-A- 116033 and UBOCC-A- 116034), resulting sequences were 100 % identical to C. acutatum species complex sequences. Based on Damm et al. (2012), strains were further characterized by sequencing partial ACT, CHS- 1, GAPDH, HIS 3, and TUB 2 genes (GenBank accession nos. KY 344741 – 52). Multilocus phylogenetic analyses carried out with the obtained and reference sequences (Damm et al. 2012) revealed that both isolates clustered within C. fioriniae, as observed using BLAST; this result was consistent with their initial identification as belonging to the C. acutatum species complex. Koch’s postulates were performed on 10 ‘Comice’ pears for each isolate. Surface sterilized fruits were wound-inoculated with 20 μl of a conidial suspension (105 conidia ml– 1). After 10 days incubation at 20 °C, symptoms identical to those initially observed developed around the inoculation point, while controls inoculated with water remained symptomless. Fungal colonies reisolated from the lesions were morphologically similar to the original isolates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of pear <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> caused by C. fioriniae in France. Moreover, to date, <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> was not considered as a major problem for pear growing, but as pears are the eighth largest fruit crop in production yield worldwide, pear <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> caused by Colletotrichum species may become a major problem in the future and require further investigation...|$|E

The basic spray program focused on control of white rot, the main target disease, and the fungicides were sprayed at 15 -day intervals from petal fall to late August using fungicides that show after-infection and EBI activity. The basic spray program was modified over 4 successive years to improve control efficacy against <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> and Marssonina blotch, which sometimes cause as much damage as white rot.

40|$|Apple (Malus domestica) is an {{important}} fruit crop in the Netherlands, with a total production of 418, 000 tons in 2011. Symptoms of apple <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> were observed on ‘Golden Delicious’ apples in the Netherlands in July 2013 after 9 months of storage in a packing house at controlled atmosphere. Lesions were round, 1 to 5 cm in diameter, gray and dry with acervuli, producing orange spore masses in concentric rings. Fruit were rinsed with sterile water, and lesions were sprayed with 70 % ethanol until droplet runoff. The skin was removed aseptically with a scalpel, and tissue under the lesion was isolated and placed onto Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA). The PDA plates were incubated at 20 °C in the dark, and single-spore isolates were propagated on PDA. The isolates were identified as Colletotrichum sp. based on culture morphology, having light gray to pale orange mycelium and, when viewed from the reverse side, ranged from pink to reddish orange. The cultures carried yellowish spore masses and dark melanized structures similar to acervuli that oozed orange conidia. Conidia were cylindrical to fusiform, pointed at one or both ends, and measured 8. 0 to 17. 0 μm × 3. 5 to 5. 0 μm. Both cultural and morphological characteristics of the pathogen {{were similar to those}} described for C. acutatum, causal agent of <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> of apple. A representative isolate (PPO- 44377) was used for multilocus gene sequencing (Damm et al. 2012). Genomic DNA was extracted using the LGC Mag Plant Kit (Berlin, Germany) in combination with the KingFisher method (Waltham, USA) and six loci were amplified and sequenced. Primer pairs ACT- 512 F + ACT- 783 R, CHS- 354 R + CHS- 79 F, GDF 1 + GDR 1, CYLH 3 F + CYLH 3 R, BT 2 Fd + BT 4 R, and ITS 1 and ITS 4 (White et al. 1990) were used for amplification of parts of the actin (ACT), chitin synthase (CHS- 1) gene, glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), histone H 3 (HIS 3), beta-tubulin (TUB 2) and ITS region of the rDNA gene, respectively. One sequence for each locus has been deposited in GenBank under Accession Nos. KR 180290 (ACT), KR 180292 (CHS- 1), KR 180293 (GAPDH), KR 180294 (HIS 3), KR 180295 (TUB 2), and KR 180296 (ITS). MegaBLAST analysis revealed that the ITS sequences matched with 98. 9 to 100 % identity to Colletotrichum spp. belonging to C. acutatum species complex (including C. godetiae). The phylogenetic trees constructed using sequences of ACT, CHS- 1, GAPDH, HIS 3, and TUB 2 of our strain (PPO- 44377), and available sequences from GenBank confirmed the identity of this strain as C. godetiae. Koch’s postulates were performed on 15 ‘Golden Delicious’ apples. Surface-sterilized fruit were inoculated with 20 μl of a spore suspension (105 conidia/ml) prepared from a 15 -day-old PDA culture after wounding with a needle. Inoculated fruits were sealed in a plastic bag and were incubated in darkness at 20 °C. Symptoms appeared after 4 to 6 days on 80 % of the fruits while mock-inoculated controls with water remained symptomless. Fungal colonies isolated from the lesions and cultured on PDA had morphological characteristics that resembled the original isolate from the infected apples. There are few reports of symptoms associated with C. godetiae on apple in Europe (Baroncelli et al. 2014; Ivic et al. 2013; Munda 2014).

40|$|The {{management}} of common apple {{diseases such as}} apple scab (Venturia inaequalis) and <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> (Colletotrichum spp.) relies heavily on effective fungicide applications. However, the development of fungicide resistance to newer fungicides has resulted in management failures and significant economic losses. This {{has led to a}} greater reliance on captan, an older fungicide, because there is a low risk of pathogens developing resistance. Label restrictions limit growers to 18 kg of captan per season, which may not provide sufficient control of both apple scab and <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> in wet years. Consequently, apple growers are faced with two equally difficult scenarios, inadequate {{management of}} diseases due to resistant pathogen strains from the use of newer fungicides or insufficient management due to restrictions on captan. ^ The goal of this research was to identify new approaches {{to reduce the amount of}} captan needed throughout the growing season without decreasing disease control. One potential tactic is to incorporate adjuvants into management strategies. Adjuvants are tank additives that increase the coverage and retention of sprays and correct issues with the tank water by affecting the pH. The incorporation of adjuvants into current apple disease management strategies has the potential to improve disease control by increasing the efficacy of captan sprays at reduced rates and reducing initial inoculum by enhancing urea-driven leaf litter decomposition. ^ To assess the improvement of captan sprays, adjuvants were combined with the lowest rate of captan and applied to apple trees every 10 - 14 days from bloom to harvest. Disease and phytotoxicity incidence and severity were observed on apple fruit to measure the effectiveness of the treatments. Results showed that Li 700 plus captan and Bond Max plus captan consistently reduced disease incidence in high-pressure years by increasing the coverage and retention of captan and lowering the pH of the tank water. Based on the data found in this study, a grower could potentially save up to $ 3, 481 -$ 4, 667 ha - 1 due to reduction of disease incidence. ^ In order to examine if adjuvants improved urea-driven decomposition of scab-infected leaves, adjuvants were combined with urea and applied to infected leaves. These leaves were then left to overwinter on the orchard floor. Leaf area decomposition and pseudothecia and ascospore reduction were observed to measure the effectiveness of the treatments. Results showed that Li 700 plus urea and Wet Betty plus urea improved urea-driven leaf decomposition and pseudothecia and ascospore reduction by increasing the nitrogen content in the leaves. Based on this study, the addition of these adjuvants to urea could delay an apple scab epidemic, saving fungicide applications and postponing initial infection past the point when apples are most susceptible to V. inaequalis. ^ The addition of adjuvants to captan or urea has the potential to improve disease management by reducing fungicide rates and reducing overwintering inoculum. Together these factors may reduce the number and dose of fungicide sprays required for apple scab and <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> management throughout the growing season and ultimately increase a grower’s net return in apple production. ...|$|E

40|$|Apple {{is one of}} the {{economically}} and culturally most important fruit crops and has many health-related benefits. Apple production is, however, sensitive to several fungal diseases including blue mold, caused by Penicillium expansum. Problems are more pronounced in organic production or in countries where postharvest application of fungicides is prohibited. To limit or overcome this problem, many studies have been focused on investigations of the mechanism of resistance/tolerance. No major gene(s) have as yet been identified, but quantitatively inherited traits, some of which are related to fruit texture and content of chemical compounds, have been shown to affect the ability of cultivars to withstand storage diseases. In the present thesis, inter-cultivar variation in terms of resistance to fungal storage diseases was investigated at two locations, i. e. Balsgård in Sweden and Njøs in Norway. The association of harvest date, fruit firmness and softening with lesion decay was investigated on large sets of cultivars. The contribution of four fruit texture-related genes (Md-ACO 1, Md-ACS 1, Md-Exp 7 and Md-PG 1) in explaining the fruit texture characteristics was examined. Fruit content of chemical compounds with a potential impact on disease resistance was also investigated, and finally the regulation of apple genes upon fungal infection was studied in order to identify candidate genes responsible for disease resistance. Inoculation-based screening indicated large variation across the investigated cultivars in terms of blue mold and <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> susceptibility. Harvest date and softening rate of fruits during storage had a large impact on resistance to fungal diseases, thus cultivars with moderate to firm fruits that soften comparatively little during storage could withstand the fungal infection comparatively well. Softening rate is, in its turn, closely associated with harvest date whereas four fruit texture-related genes had lower predictive power than expected. Quantifying the chemical compounds in the fruit samples revealed that some of these compounds, especially flavonols and procyanidin B 2, could contribute to resistance against blue mold, whereas contents of malic acids or total titratable acidity had considerably less impact. Differential expression of FLS, LDOX, and CHS genes involved in biosynthesis of flavonoids and PGIP, TT 10, WAK 1 and CTL 1 genes related to cell wall structure indicate the importance of fruit characteristics and biochemical compounds in the resistance mechanism...|$|E

In response to environmental cues such as {{contact with the}} host, Glomerella cingulata forms a special structure called an appressorium, which accumulates glycerol and thereby generates a sufficiently high turgor pressure to push an infection peg into the host tissue. It is known that the cAMP and MAPK signalling transduction pathways control appressorium formation and function in Colletotrichum species and other appressorium-forming fungi. This process {{is accompanied by a}} global change in gene expression. Little is known of transcriptional regulation during this process. The aim of this project was to study the transcriptional regulation of appressorium formation and function in G. cingulata. The G cingulata SAP gene had previously been shown to be expressed as a longer transcript during the early stage of appressorium differentiation. It was considered possible that the transcription factors that regulated expression of the longer transcript may be also involved in the regulation of appressorium differentiation. Identification of the transcription factor involved may help to understand the mechanisms that regulate appressorium differentiation. The plan was to use the yeast one-hybrid system to isolate the transcription factor. This required identification of the promoter regions responsible for expression of the longer SAP transcript. Therefore, the G. cingulata SAP promoter was characterized by mapping the transcription start point. Three transcription start points were determined by RLM-RACE. To further characterise the promoters, SAP-GFP reporter plasmids were constructed and transformed into G. cingulata. Even though a reasonable level of GFP expression was observed in RT-PCR experiments, however, no differences in fluorescence intensity were seen between the wild type and GFP reporter transformants. Therefore, no further attempts to study the sap promoter were made. The candidate gene approach was chosen as an alternative way to study the transcriptional regulation of appressorium formation and function in G. cingulata. The G. cingulata StuA gene was cloned using degenerate PCR, single specific primer PCR, subgenomic library screening and plasmid rescue from a disruption mutant. Targeted gene deletion of the G. cingulata StuA gene was successful. Deletion mutants display many phenotypic changes. Complementation mutants were constructed to confirm the function of this gene. A full length copy of this gene together with a second selection marker was reintroduced into the deletion mutant and the wild type phenotype was restored. Deletion mutants form appressoria at the normal rate and with unaltered morphology. In comparison with the wild type, these appressoria did not generate high turgor pressure as shown by a cytorrhysis assay. This resulted in a defect in appressorium penetration of onion epidermal cells. Nor were these mutants able to invade unwounded apples. Therefore, the G. cingulata StuA gene is required for appressorium function. In addition, deletion mutants displayed stunted aerial hyphae, "wettable" mycelium, reduced conidia production, and a defect in conidiophore and perithecium formation. These results suggested that the G. cingulata StuA gene has multiple roles in fungal development...|$|E
