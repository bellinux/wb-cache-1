5|$|Coal <b>balls</b> in North America {{were first}} found in Iowa coal seams in 1894, {{although}} {{the connection to}} European coal <b>balls</b> was not made until Adolf Carl Noé (whose coal ball was found by Gilbert Cady) drew the parallel in 1922. Noé's work renewed interest in coal <b>balls,</b> and by the 1930s had drawn paleobotanists from Europe to the Illinois Basin in search of them.|$|E
5|$|Coal <b>balls</b> may {{be found}} in coal seams across North America and Eurasia. North American coal <b>balls</b> are more widespread, both stratigraphically and geologically, than those in Europe. The oldest known coal <b>balls</b> date from the Namurian stage of the Carboniferous; they were found in Germany and on the {{territory}} of former Czechoslovakia.|$|E
50|$|An {{exercise}} <b>ball,</b> {{also known}} as a Swiss <b>Ball,</b> is a <b>ball</b> constructed of soft elastic with a diameter of approximately 35 to 85 centimeters (14 to 34 inches) and filled with air. The air pressure is changed by removing a valve stem and either filling with air or letting the <b>ball</b> deflate. It is most often used in physical therapy, athletic training and exercise.It can also be used for weight training.The <b>ball,</b> while often referred to as a Swiss <b>ball,</b> is also known by a number of different names, including balance <b>ball,</b> birth <b>ball,</b> body <b>ball,</b> <b>ball,</b> fitness <b>ball,</b> gym <b>ball,</b> gymnastic <b>ball,</b> physio <b>ball,</b> pilates <b>ball,</b> Pezzi <b>ball,</b> stability <b>ball,</b> Swedish <b>ball,</b> therapy <b>ball,</b> or yoga <b>ball.</b>|$|R

5|$|Glittery {{bands of}} mica {{decorated}} some <b>balls</b> {{while others were}} silk screened with seasonal motifs such as snowy scenes, sleigh rides, carolers, and poinsettias. Some <b>balls</b> featured silvery indents on their surfaces that reflected the surrounding light. In the early 1950s, clear glass <b>balls</b> appeared decorated with bands of color or glittering sparkles. Molded plastic Santa Clauses, angels, snowmen, and other holiday icons were inexpensive, mass-produced, and readily available.|$|E
5|$|In 1855, two English scientists, Joseph Dalton Hooker and Edward William Binney, {{made the}} first {{scientific}} description of coal <b>balls</b> in England, and the initial research on coal <b>balls</b> {{was carried out in}} Europe. North American coal <b>balls</b> were discovered and identified in 1922. Coal <b>balls</b> have since been found in other countries, leading to the discovery of hundreds of species and genera.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Sergius Mamay and Ellis Yochelson {{analysed}} North American coal <b>balls.</b> Their {{discovery of}} marine organisms led to classification of coal <b>balls</b> were sorted into three types: normal (sometimes known as floral), containing only plant matter; faunal, containing animal fossils only; and mixed, containing both {{plant and animal}} material. Mixed coal <b>balls</b> are further divided into heterogeneous, where the plant and animal material was distinctly separated; and homogeneous, lacking that separation.|$|E

5|$|In coal seams, coal <b>balls</b> are {{completely}} surrounded by coal. They are often found randomly {{scattered throughout the}} seam in isolated groups, usually in {{the upper half of}} the seam. Their occurrence in coal seams can be either extremely sporadic or regular; many coal seams have been found to contain no coal <b>balls,</b> while others have been found to contain so many coal <b>balls</b> that miners avoid the area entirely.|$|E
5|$|Marie Stopes and David Watson {{analysed}} coal ball {{samples and}} decided that coal <b>balls</b> formed in situ. They {{stressed the importance of}} interaction with seawater, believing that it was necessary for the formation of coal <b>balls.</b> Some supporters of the in situ theory believe that Stopes' and Watson's discovery of a plant stem extending through multiple coal <b>balls</b> shows that coal <b>balls</b> formed in situ, stating that the drift theory fails to explain Stopes' and Watson's observation. They also cite fragile pieces of organic material projecting outside some coal <b>balls,</b> contending that if the drift theory was correct, the projections would have been destroyed, and some large coal <b>balls</b> are large enough that they could never have been able to be transported in the first place.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{sometimes}} {{played with the}} larger and heavier (and unnumbered) carom billiard <b>balls</b> instead of pocket billiard <b>balls.</b> Such is the case at the Union Club and was also at the University of Michigan Billiards & Games Room, where the faculty devoted {{most of their time}} to bottle pool. Not incidentally three-cushion billiards, which uses these larger <b>balls,</b> was also a mainstay in that room and touring three-cushion professional Carl Conlon was a fixture there until his death in 1997. In this variation, a solid-yellow (or dotted) second cue ball is used in place of the 1 ball, and the red ball, known traditionally as the , is used in place of the 2 ball. The use of such <b>balls</b> makes scoring by caroms easier, but makes pocketing <b>balls</b> (and scratching) more difficult because the larger <b>balls</b> must still be made in the ordinarily-sized pool pockets.|$|E

The <b>ball</b> screw extends through the <b>ball</b> nut and has a first end and a second end. The <b>ball</b> screw receives the drive force from the <b>ball</b> nut and in response selectively translates between a retract position and a extend position. The <b>ball</b> screw stop is mounted on the <b>ball</b> screw proximate the first end to translate therewith. The <b>ball</b> screw stop engages the <b>ball</b> nut when the <b>ball</b> screw is in the extend position, translates, with compliance, a predetermined distance toward the first end upon engaging the <b>ball</b> nut, and prevents further rotation of the <b>ball</b> screw upon translating the predetermined distance...|$|R
5|$|A {{pitch that}} is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are {{recorded}} strikes out. A batter against whom four <b>balls</b> are recorded is awarded a base on <b>balls</b> or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining <b>balls</b> and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.|$|E
5|$|After Hayden's departure, Ponting {{was joined}} by Martyn, who {{completed}} his half-century in 46 <b>balls.</b> Ponting scored at a slower rate, reaching his 50 off 74 <b>balls</b> with one four. After completing his half century, he accelerated; he hit two sixes off Harbhajan and one off Ashish Nehra. The pair added 100 runs off 109 <b>balls</b> for the third wicket. Ponting reached his century quickly—his second fifty came off 29 <b>balls.</b> At {{the end of the}} innings, Australia had scored 359 runs for two wickets; Ponting had scored 140 not out (off 121 balls; four fours and eight sixes) and Martyn hit 88 not out (off 84 balls; seven fours and one six) respectively. As of the 2015 competition, Ponting's innings remains the highest individual score by a captain in a World Cup final, and Australia's total remains the highest by a team in a World Cup final. The 234-run stand between Ponting and Marytn was a record partnership for Australia in ODIs at that point in time. The Indian bowlers conceded 37 extras. Srinath conceded 87 runs without taking a wicket—the most expensive figures in his career—in what was his last international game.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{went on to}} face India in the semi-final. Chasing {{a target}} of 120, Poulton came in to join captain Blackwell—who had {{promoted}} herself up the order—at 2/75, with 45 runs needed from 56 <b>balls.</b> Poulton hit 30 from 26 <b>balls</b> to seal an Australian victory with seven wickets and seven <b>balls</b> to spare. She brought up the winning runs with a lofted drive that bounced once before going for four runs. In the final against New Zealand, Australia started poorly after electing to bat. Nitschke fell in the third over to bring Poulton in at 1/10, before Villani and Blackwell fell quickly to leave Australia at 3/20 in the sixth over. This {{was followed by a}} consolidating partnership of 30 between Poulton and Cameron, but they were unable to lift the run rate substantially; their stand took 45 <b>balls.</b> Poulton was caught trying to loft a ball over cover, and two <b>balls</b> later, Cameron was bowled, leaving Australia at 5/51 in the 13th over. Only Poulton managed a solitary boundary. A later burst took Australia to 8/106 from their 20 overs and Poulton ended with the highest score of 20 from 28 <b>balls.</b> The Australians then restricted New Zealand to 6/103 to complete a three-run win. Poulton was Australian's highest run-scorer for the tournament and the third among all players.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{went on to}} face India in the semi-final. Healy stumped leading Indian batsman Mithali Raj {{from the}} bowling of Sthalekar and was not {{required}} to bat as Australia reached their target of 120 with seven wickets and seven <b>balls</b> to spare. Australia elected to bat first in the final against New Zealand, but was top-order struggled and Healy came to the crease to join Elliott at 5/51 in the 13th over {{after the fall of}} two wickets in quick succession. The pair lifted the run rate by adding 21 runs in 18 <b>balls.</b> Healy scored 10 from as many <b>balls,</b> but was then run out attempting a second run after being dropped by Sara McGlashan in the outfield. This left the score at 6/72 in the 16th over, and Australia eventually ended on 8/106.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Healy took one catch to dismiss Danielle Hazell from the bowling of Sthalekar. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Australia were {{struggling}} when Healy {{came to the}} crease with the score at 7/63 after 14.2 overs. Three wickets had fallen {{in the space of}} 16 <b>balls,</b> during which only three runs had been added, and England had the momentum, and 42 runs were needed from 34 <b>balls</b> for victory. Healy then struck three fours, making 15 from 9 <b>balls</b> before being dismissed by Nicki Shaw, ending a stand of 23 from 13 <b>balls</b> with Sthalekar. However, Rene Farrell was run out going for the winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E
