The plasma lines are observed by the incoherent scatter radar at the observatory. They originate in the sporadic E layer when the <b>blanketing</b> <b>frequency</b> exceeds the exciting frequency, a result which confirms that the plasma is overdense for the exciting frequency. Around {{the time when the}} <b>blanketing</b> <b>frequency</b> falls through the exciting frequency, large fluctuations in the plasma line intensities are observed, and thus the possibility of overdense patches drifting through the sampled volume is suggested...|$|E

30|$|Studies of the {{presence}} of Es layers during periods of disturbance have being carried out by Batista and Abdu (1977) at low latitudes in the Brazilian sector. They compiled the total frequency (ftEs), and the <b>blanketing</b> <b>frequency</b> (fbEs), of Es layers during several magnetic storms during the solar cycle 20 and stated that fbEs show a well-defined enhancement of appreciable magnitude, observed 1 – 3 days after the Sudden Commencement (SC) of the storms. Also, Afraimovich et al. (2001) established that extreme solar flares may cause sudden changes in ionospheric ionization, which can lead to global distribution changes. They show that enhancements of X-ray and UV radiation intensity, that are observed during chromospheric flares, cause sudden increases in the process of the formation of free electrons, increasing the electron density in ionospheric layers.|$|E

Italy was completely located in the NmE enhanced zone according to COSMIC observations for the periods in question. COSMIC‐observed NmE values in the NmE enhanced zone do not coincide with NmE scaled from ionograms {{in accordance with the}} URSI Recommendations, but the IRI model correctly describes monthly median NmE contrary to the Chu et al. (2009) conclusion. Three month averaged COSMIC NmE values turn out to be close to monthly median NmE corresponding to the <b>blanketing</b> <b>frequency</b> fbEs. A conclusion is made that sporadic E practically permanently existing during daytime hours in summer strongly contributes to NmE observed by COSMIC. Possible reasons for the occurrence of the NmE enhanced zones at middle latitudes are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} the study of ionospheric {{variations}} in the summer months of 1998 - 2002 at an ionospheric station of vertical sounding "Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky" are presented. Anomalous variations of virtual sporadic-E height (h'Es), Es <b>blanketing</b> <b>frequency</b> (fbEs), and the critical frequency of the ionospheric F 2 layer (foF 2) (which {{can be attributed to the}} possible earthquake precursors) are selected. The high efficiency of the selection of ionospheric earthquake precursors based on the several parameters of Es and F 2 layers is shown. The empirical dependence, which reflects the connection between the lead-time of the earthquake moment, the distance to the epicenter from the observation point, and the magnitude of the earthquake are obtained. This empirical dependence is consistent with the {{results of the}} detection of earthquake precursors by measuring the physical parameters of the Earth's crust in the same region...|$|E
30|$|We have {{routinely}} {{monitored the}} total frequency (ftEs) and the <b>blanketing</b> <b>frequency</b> (fbEs) of sporadic E layers with the digital sounder under the magnetic equator in the Brazilian sector. Sporadic layers {{appear in the}} equatorial region (Esq) at heights between 90 and 130  km, mainly due to irregularities in the equatorial electrojet current. However, during the recovery phase of the October 2003 superstorm, an anomalous intensification of the ionospheric density that exceeded the normal ambient background values for local time and location was observed. The parameter fbEs rose to almost 7.5  MHz during this event, due to a type “c” blanketing sporadic layer (Esc), which is driven by wind shear. This result is {{discussed in terms of}} the atmosphere dynamics based on magnetic signature of the equatorial electrojet current using magnetometer data. Also, using data measured by sensors onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) 10 we analyze the possible influence of the solar flare-associated X-ray flux as an additional source of ionization.|$|E

30|$|Sporadic layers {{appear in}} the {{equatorial}} region (Esq) between 90 and 130 km mainly due to irregularities in the electrojet equatorial (EEJ) current. In the present work, we have analyzed {{the behavior of the}} frequency parameters associated with these sporadic layers, covering the days before, during, and subsequent to, the intense magnetic storm that occurred on December 14, 2006. The parameters used in our analyses are the top frequency (ftEs) and <b>blanketing</b> <b>frequency</b> (fbEs) of the Es layer as measured over São Luís, Brazil (2.33 °S, 44.2 °W, dip: − 4.5 °) by digital ionosonde. A tentative association between these parameters and X-ray data measured by sensors on board the GOES satellite was carried out. Also, we investigated the effects on the dynamics of the equatorial electrojet using magnetometer data related to the presence of these Es layers. Our analyses show that there are notable changes in the fbEs, which are characterized by the occurrence of peaks that exceed the ambient background values.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{phenomena}} of sporadic-E ionization, cold fronts and microbarometric activity are related. The method of superimposed epoch applied to sporadic-E parameters indicated that on the frontal days sporadic-E tends to occur more frequently and with higher critical frequency than for the 10 preceding and 10 following days. No such effects were observed {{in the case of}} the <b>blanketing</b> <b>frequency</b> of sporadic-E, z. hfl;bEs. The data used are for Brisbane and cover a period of almost two years. Generation of atmospheric waves in the frontal region appears to cause the enhancement of microbarometric oscillations. A part of this wave energy leaking to ionospheric heights is suggested as the possible cause of the enhancement of sporadic-E. It is not clear whether the wind shear provided by the waves themselves, or the turbulence they generated, was responsible for the sporadic-E enhancement. No effect of geomagnetic activity on the frequency of occurrence and the critical frequency of sporadic-E, for the chosen period, is discernible...|$|E

Hourly values of f oEs, f bEs (the <b>blanketing</b> critical <b>frequency)</b> and h'Es from several observatories are analysed for the lunar semidiurnal tide. It is found that the phase of the tide in f oEs is often about 3 hours later than for h'Es in agreement with the theory. Seasonal variations in the tide are also examined with the statistically most significant results (largest amplitudes) usually occurring in summer. After reviewing the many difficulties associated with determining the lunar tide in Es, both experimentally and theoretically, the analysed phase results are compared with what might be expected from Hagan's global scale wave model.

40|$|International audienceDuring the SEEK 2 rocket campaign, ionograms were {{recorded}} every minute at the Yamagawa Radio Observatory at about 90 km {{west of the}} region monitored by a VHF (very high frequency) coherent backscatter radar. Sporadic E-layer parameters, which include the critical (foEs) and <b>blanketing</b> (fbEs) <b>frequencies,</b> the layer height (h'Es), and {{the width of the}} range spread of sporadic E-traces, were compared with RTI (range-time-intensity) plots of VHF quasi-periodic (QP) and continuous coherent backscatter echoes. A close relationship was found between the appearance of QP echoes in the RTI plots and the level of spatial inhomogeneity in sporadic E plasma, signified here by the difference between foEs and fbEs. During QP echo events, foEs increased while fbEs decreased, so that the difference foEs-fbEs was enhanced, indicating the development of strong spatial structuring in electron density within a sporadic E-layer. On the other hand, increases in sporadic E range spreading also correlated with the occurrence of QP echoes but the degree of correlation varied from event to event. Continuous radar echoes were observed in association with low altitude sporadic E-layers, located well below 100 km and at times as low as 90 km. During the continuous echo events, both foEs and fbEs were less variable, and the difference foEs-fbEs was small and not as dynamic as in the QP echoes. On the other hand, the Es-layer spread intensified during continuous echoes, which means that some patchiness or corrugation in those low altitude layers is also necessary for the continuous backscatter echoes to take place...|$|R

30|$|We {{have used}} data from two {{separate}} types of ground-based equipment: a digital ionosonde and two magnetometers, installed under, and close to, the dip equator in the Brazilian sector. The digital ionosonde placed at São Luís (SLZ, 2.3 °S, 44.2 °W, dip − 3.3 °), under the magnetic equator, took a measurement every 15  min, sending consecutive pulses {{in the frequency}} range from 0.5 to 30  MHz, with a frequency step of 0.5  MHz. After careful manual reprocessing of all ionograms covering the desired period, we determine the ionospheric parameters ftEs and fbEs. The first parameter is the total frequency, which corresponds to the maximum frequency of the sporadic trace observed in the ionogram. The other parameter is the <b>blanketing</b> <b>frequency</b> which can be determined in two different ways: (1) When the Esb layers are present, the fbEs correspond to the first frequency observed at the upper layer, and (2) when we observe Esq layers only, the fbEs is obtained {{at the point where}} the F layer reflections begin to be observed (fminF).|$|E
30|$|Based on HF sounders, several {{different}} types of Es have been detected and their classification is based primarily on their appearance in ionograms, {{taking into account the}} transparent, or blanketing, nature and the location. The formation mechanisms have been understood only later. The <b>blanketing</b> <b>frequency</b> Es layers (Esb) (Tsunoda, 2008) were originally classified as being of several types, and were labeled as follows: “f” (flat, a nocturnal type of Es), “l” (low, a diurnal type of Es), “c” (cusp, connected {{to the end of the}} E-layer trace), “h” (high, observed at higher altitudes), and “a” (auroral). The development of Es-a layers are strongly associated with particle precipitation at high latitudes (Sauli and Bourdillon, 2008). In a comprehensive study of middle and low latitudes, Whitehead (1989) stated that E-region ionization enhancements (Es-l, -f, -c, -h) can be formed due to vertical shear caused by opposing horizontal neutral winds. Such a shear can be driven by gravity waves (Hook, 1970; Jayachandran, 1991; Lanchester et al., 1991) or tidal motions (Chimmonas, 1971).|$|E

40|$|Soil pipes were {{surveyed}} in 160 British blanket peat catchments using consistent application of ground penetrating radar. Soil pipes {{were found in}} all catchments. The mean frequency of piping was 69 per kilometer of surveyed transect. Land management (moorland gripping) appears to exert the most important control on hillslope pipe <b>frequency</b> in <b>blanket</b> peats. Management practice in peatlands may therefore induce more rapid subsurface erosion, carbon loss and landform denudation via enhanced preferential flow. Topographic position is also important, with topslopes having greater pipe frequencies than footslopes, followed by midslopes with lowest frequencies. Slope gradient, however, is not {{a significant factor in}} controlling <b>blanket</b> peat pipe <b>frequency.</b> I propose that peat structural properties inherited from the way a blanket peat develops on a hillslope strongly control pipe network development.

It was found out that the frequency parameters spectrum of E sub s within the range of 1 - 10 cycles/h are discrete with one or two maxima. The first, a low frequency maximum with T= 40 min, is of larger amplitude, stable and exists permanently; the second one with T = 10 min is less stable, occurs irregularly and more often within f sub o E sub s. Further, the first maximum corresponds to a higher level of coherence which decreases as the distance to the stations increases. It is concluded that the low-frequency maximum is induced by cellular eddies, usually interpreted as wind shears with horizontal dimensions of not more than 300 km. Irregularity, small amplitude, and low coherence in the range of the second maximum are indicative of the fact that turbulence must be its only source...|$|E

30|$|The main {{difference}} between Esq and Esb {{is that the}} first is a diffuse trace in the ionogram that is transparent to radio signals, originated by instabilities in the EEJ. The Esb layers, on the other hand, can be formed by winds in low/midlatitudes, and they block the upper signal in ionograms. Only the frequencies higher than the <b>blanketing</b> <b>frequency</b> (f > fbEs) will propagate upwards and the reflected signal will be registered in the ionogram. When fbEs is higher than the F layer critical frequency (foF 2), no signal will be reflected from the F region. Indeed, most of the ionograms shown in S and W events belong to the first category, i.e., the Es layer is partially blocking the upper layers {{in such a way that}} F layer can be observed at frequencies above fbEs. Although the condition fbEs > foF 2 is satisfied only in a few ionograms (see Fig.  2 at 1340 and 1400), it is clear the presence of Esb for both cases. In summary, in both cases the two types of Es, Esq and Esb are present, but in the first case the layer is under strong EEJ influence, while in the second this influence is weaker. Therefore, this allows us to investigate the role of the electric field in the formation or disruption of Esb.|$|E

Large space structures designers and evaluators rely on metrics to compare boom, telescope, and long antenna architectures.

The approach takes advantage of the fact that an ideal solar array structure is a system of coupled beam and tensioned blanket components rather than the typical simplifying approach of considering only one beam with a distributed mass as the <b>blanket.</b> A fundamental <b>frequency</b> relation is developed to represent a beam-cable system in a clamped-free boundary condition. A structural model of the array is developed on the basis of minimum mass and minimum beam cost using constraint analysis methods and weight equations. This structural model expression is solved numerically using root finding algorithms, is transformed into an approximate expression using regression techniques, and the terms are symbolically related into scaling parameters and scaling indices. These metrics enable straightforward comparison {{of a wide range of}} array sizes, geometric forms, column types, column quantities, blanket mass densities, acceleration loads, fundamental frequencies, and power production values.

40|$|The {{starting}} point of this investigation is the partially transparent echo from midlatitude sporadic-E layers as recorded by ionosondes; this is the range of frequencies between the <b>blanketing</b> <b>frequency</b> and the maximum frequency. One interpretation {{is that it is}} a partial reflection at the steep gradients of electron density which characterize the vertical profile of the layers as recorded in rocket flights. The theory of reflection at gradients is developed and evaluated in the case of five layers. It is found that this mechanism is not sufficient to explain the phenomenon. An alternative explanation is that the midlatitude sporadic-E layers are not uniform in the horizontal plane but contain localized regions of high electron density. This is investigated using data obtained by incoherent-scatter radar and is found to provide a satisfactory explanation. The main features of mid latitude sporadic-E layers are consistent with the convergence of metallic ions as described by the wind-shear theory applied to gravity waves and tides.
