5|$|For the new {{generation}} of students, producers auditioned over six hundred school-aged children in an attempt to provide characters to which the teenaged target-audience could relate.

"Buffy <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> Slayer" [...] (1997) {{inspired}} {{from the}} movie of the same title, while this series starred Sarah Michelle Gellar as <b>Buffy.</b> <b>The</b> <b>vampires</b> in this series are presented as strong but fundamentally 'fragile' walking corpses, vulnerable to sunlight, decapitation, and stakes through the heart, and are clearly established as being demons possessing human corpses rather than humans corrupted by their <b>vampire</b> instincts. <b>The</b> character of Angel- played by David Boreanaz- is an exception to this rule as he was cursed with his soul over a century ago, restoring his capacity for compassion and grief, driving him to seek redemption for his sins in the spin-off series [...] "Angel".|$|R

5|$|Perry was {{inspired}} to write the episode due to his interest in conspiracy theory literature, which he finds interesting but does not believe in. The Coast to Coast AM radio show featured in the episode also served as an inspiration, and its host Art Bell agreed to appear as himself. Guest star James Marsters was cast immediately after his audition {{for the role of}} Eric Swan, and although several of Millennium crew were fans of the series <b>Buffy</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> Slayer, in which Marsters had a recurring role, Perry recalled none of them recognizing the actor during his audition due to the strength of his performance.|$|E

5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} <b>Buffy</b> <b>The</b> <b>Vampire</b> Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E
5|$|Each {{season of}} <b>Buffy</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> Slayer (often {{simplified}} as Buffy) presents an overall theme episodes tie into. Roz Kaveney identifies family and belonging as the overall {{theme of the}} fifth season. Buffy's mother Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) begins experiencing headaches {{at the beginning of}} the season, once collapsing and requiring hospitalization. She subsequently has a brain tumor removed. She has been recovering well. In the previous episode, she receives flowers from a male suitor, which Buffy finds at the end of that episode.

50|$|At the school, Dawn and Amanda hide in a {{classroom}} and push a set of drawers against the door while Dawn prepares for a plan of escape. <b>Buffy</b> tosses <b>the</b> <b>vampire</b> around while lecturing the girls about successful fighting and keeping a straight head during battle. Meanwhile, Dawn puts Buffy's lessons to use and acts resourcefully until <b>the</b> <b>vampire</b> pins {{her to the ground}} and goes in for the bite. The Bringers then suddenly break in through the windows and grab Amanda instead of Dawn. After beating up <b>the</b> <b>vampire</b> a bit, <b>Buffy</b> drops her stake and along with Spike, she leaves the girls trapped alone with <b>the</b> <b>vampire.</b> Back at <b>the</b> house, Willow, Xander and Anya find that Dawn has bolted and Willow rushes to do a spell to find her before it's too late.|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> Bronze, <b>Buffy</b> and <b>the</b> others party until <b>the</b> <b>vampires,</b> led by one named Scylla, {{break in}} and kidnap several students, {{including}} Willow. <b>Buffy</b> chases <b>the</b> <b>vampires</b> outside where she encounters and fights off Spike. Buffy continues to follow <b>the</b> <b>vampires</b> {{in hopes of}} rescuing her friends and eventually {{ends up in the}} cemetery where she encounters the powerful necromancer Materiani who summons zombies to aid in delaying her. Buffy fights through waves of vampires, zombies and hellhounds to a mausoleum where she finds Scylla and Willow. Buffy fights Scylla who, like Malik, proves more powerful than an ordinary vampire. Buffy beats Scylla who flees rather than continue the fight, leaving Willow behind. Realizing that Spike has taken over the Sunken Church and still has more victims, Buffy decides to go after them after consulting with her friends. The group can't come to any conclusion besides that Spike may be trying to draw an ancient evil forth into this world and Buffy sets off again on her own.|$|R
25|$|Cordelia {{arrives at}} the library and unwittingly {{releases}} Vampire Willow, who immediately attacks her, but Wesley intervenes and drives <b>the</b> <b>vampire</b> away. At <b>the</b> Bronze, although Anya exposes Willow's disguise, <b>Buffy</b> defeats <b>the</b> other <b>vampires,</b> then captures <b>the</b> returning doppelganger. Anya returns vampiric Willow to her own timeline, where the alternate Oz immediately kills her. The next day, Percy, thoroughly intimidated by Willow's doppelganger (and believing she was the real Willow), shows up for tutoring with all his work completed and makes it clear he intends to please her from now on.|$|R
5|$|Numerous {{supporting}} {{characters have}} been given recurring appearances in the progressive storyline, including former Gilmore Girls actor Edward Herrmann who appeared in three episodes. Seth Green of <b>Buffy</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> Slayer guest starred in two episodes, whereas Lauren Stamile portrayed nurse Rose, a love interest for Derek. Former regular Kate Walsh appeared {{for the first time}} since her departure on May 1, 2008 receiving a special guest star billing in the role of Addison Montgomery, now the main character of the spin-off Private Practice. Jeff Perry, Loretta Devine and Debra Monk reprised their roles as Thatcher Grey, Adele Webber and Louise O'Malley, respectively. Diahann Carroll and Elizabeth Reaser continued their season three-introduced roles as Jane Burke and Rebecca Pope, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The role of John Hart in Torchwood {{was written}} with the casting of Marsters in mind after he {{contacted}} the shows' producers expressing {{his interest in}} appearing in the programme's parent show, Doctor Who. The character is used to illuminate some of Jack's own characteristics as a doppelgänger who provides both an exaggerated version of, and a parallel to, aspects of Jack's persona. Both Marsters and the general media also compared aspects of Hart's character to Marsters's role as Spike in <b>Buffy</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> Slayer and Angel. Whilst a few reviewers criticised the character in relation to his impact of the show's tone, a larger number welcomed the character and the energy Marsters brought to the role.|$|E
5|$|Christy is {{the oldest}} of Carl and Helen Jenkins's two daughters. Both of her parents are mortal, and her powers were {{inherited}} from her maternal grandmother, making her a carrier of the genes determining magical ability. As a witch, Christy possesses the basic ability to cast spells, perform rituals, brew potions, scry for lost people or objects {{through the use of}} a crystal pendant, and communicate with the dead. She also possesses an advanced form of telepathy, enabling her to hear and project her thoughts, as well as channeling other magical creatures' powers. Carl and Helen Jenkins (David Starzyk and Barbara Niven) said Christy heard voices prior to her kidnapping, implying that this power was already active. As a firestarter, Christy had the power of pyrokinesis; this power could be augmented by Billie's projection powers to vanquish demons previously believed to be invincible. Christy was identified as the Key to the Ultimate Power due to her relationship with Billie. Demain of Television Without Pity compared Christy to <b>Buffy</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> Slayer character Dawn Summers as they were both referenced as the Key.|$|E
50|$|At <b>the</b> senior dance, <b>Buffy</b> {{tries to}} patch {{things up with}} her friends but they turn against her, and she is dismayed to find Jeffrey has dumped her {{for one of her}} friends.

After overpowering <b>the</b> <b>vampires,</b> she confronts Lothos inside the school and kills Amilyn. Lothos hypnotizes Buffy again and when the dance music stops, she remembers Merrick's words and is ready to defend herself. Lothos ignites her cross but she uses hairspray to create a makeshift flame-thrower and burns him before escaping back into <b>the</b> gym. <b>Buffy</b> sees everybody recover from the attack, but Lothos emerges again getting into a fight with Buffy, who then stakes him.|$|R
5000|$|The series {{begins when}} <b>Buffy</b> Summers, <b>the</b> current <b>vampire</b> slayer, moves to 1630 Revello Drive, and begins {{attending}} Sunnydale High School. There she meets new friends, including Willow Rosenberg, Xander Harris, {{and her new}} watcher, Rupert Giles. This [...] "Scooby Gang", eventually including popular cheerleader Cordelia Chase and Willows boyfriend Oz, often hangs out at the Bronze, the Espresso Pump (a local coffee house with a retro gas station motif) and <b>the</b> Sun Cinema. <b>Buffys</b> mother, Joyce, works in an art gallery in Sunnydale. (It {{is not clear whether}} or not she owns the gallery.) ...|$|R
50|$|Using {{the college}} {{computer}} system, the pair locate <b>the</b> <b>vampire</b> gang in a disused fraternity house. While <b>Buffy</b> angrily watches <b>the</b> <b>vampires</b> using and abusing her things {{through the glass}} roof of the house, Xander leaves to round up the assistance of Willow and Oz. Unfortunately, the roof breaks and <b>Buffy</b> lands on <b>the</b> {{floor in front of}} <b>the</b> <b>vampires.</b> She and Sunday begin to fight and Buffy is once again losing, in part because of her sore arm from their previous encounter, but seeing Sunday damage the Class Protector award she was given at her senior prom angers Buffy enough to regain her confidence and fight back soundly. The others show up to fight off and kill the rest of <b>the</b> <b>vampires</b> although two of them escape, and Buffy takes out Sunday with a backhand throw of a broken tennis racket. As Buffy and friends are returning to the dorm with her belongings, Giles makes a belated appearance with weapons, apologising for his earlier dismissal of her fears and promising that they will fight the evil together.|$|R
