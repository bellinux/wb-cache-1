5|$|Eugene Ellsworth Landy (November 26, 1934– March 22, 2006) was an American {{psychologist}} and psychotherapist {{best known for}} his unconventional 24-hour therapy, as well as for ethical violations concerning his treatment of the Beach Boys co-founder <b>Brian</b> <b>Wilson</b> in the 1980s. The latter events were dramatized in the biographical film Love & Mercy (2014), in which Landy is portrayed by Paul Giamatti.|$|E
5|$|Landy {{maintained}} that his songwriting collaborations on <b>Brian</b> <b>Wilson</b> earned him less than $50,000. For the publishing of Wilson's autobiographic memoir , Landy stood to earn 30% of its proceeds. The book glorifies Landy {{and was later}} disowned by Wilson, and its contents have raised questions of plagiarism. Landy denied accusations {{that he was involved}} as a ghostwriter. Wilson continued to pay Landy a salary of about $300,000 a year for advice on creative decisions.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the loss}} of the {{original}} multi-track tape, there had never been an official true stereo release of the final track until the 2012 remastered version of Smiley Smile. The stereo mix was made possible through the invention of new digital technology by Derry Fitzgerald, and received the blessing of <b>Brian</b> <b>Wilson</b> and Mark Linett. Fitzgerald's software extracted individual instrumental and vocal stems from the original mono master—as the multi-track vocals remained missing—to construct the stereo version that appears on the 2012 reissue of Smiley Smile.|$|E
5|$|Hennessey {{spent the}} entire 2007 season in the bullpen for the Giants. At the {{beginning}} of June, he was named the closer by Giants' manager Bruce Bochy after Armando Benítez was traded. From June 30 to August 31, he converted saves in 14 straight save opportunities, the longest streak by a Giant since Robb Nen had a 28-save streak in 2000; overall, Hennessey converted 17 out of 19 saves from May 30 to August 31. Afterwards, he converted only two out of five opportunities before <b>Brian</b> <b>Wilson</b> took over the closer role. In 2007, he went 45 and had a 3.42 ERA and 19 saves (out of 24 opportunities).|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{a remote}} {{parallel}} was {{the development of}} Shibuya-kei, which also revisited the trend of foregrounding instruments like strings and horns in its arrangements. The genre was informed by classic Western pop music, especially the orchestral domains occupied by Burt Bacharach, <b>Brian</b> <b>Wilson,</b> Phil Spector, and Serge Gainsbourg. Unlike other Japanese music scenes, its audiences did not necessarily cross over into anime fandoms, but rather indie pop enthusiasts. This was partly because many of its bands were distributed in the United States through major indie labels like Matador and Grand Royal. Shibuya-kei ultimately peaked in the late 1990s and declined after its principal players began moving into other music styles.|$|E

He finished the year 1–5 with a 5.88 ERA in thirty-three games (four starts).|$|E
5|$|Brown {{was elected}} to Parliament on his second attempt as a Labour MP for Dunfermline East in 1983 general election. His first Westminster office mate was a newly elected MP from the Sedgefield constituency, Tony Blair. Brown became an {{opposition}} spokesman on Trade and Industry in 1985. In 1986, he published a biography of the Independent Labour Party politician James Maxton, {{the subject of his}} doctoral thesis. Brown was Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 1987 to 1989 and then Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, before becoming Shadow Chancellor in 1992. Having led the Labour Movement Yes campaign, refusing to join the cross-party Yes for Scotland campaign, during the 1979 Scottish devolution referendum, while other senior Labour politicians – including Robin Cook, Tam Dalyell and <b>Brian</b> <b>Wilson</b> – campaigned for a No vote, Brown was subsequently a key participant in the Scottish Constitutional Convention, signing the Claim of Right for Scotland in 1989.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, rock spawned several subgenres, {{beginning}} with surf. Surf was an instrumental guitar genre {{characterized by a}} distorted sound, associated with the Southern California surfing youth culture. Inspired by the lyrical focus of surf, The Beach Boys began recording in 1961 with an elaborate, pop-friendly, and harmonic sound. As their fame grew, The Beach Boys' songwriter <b>Brian</b> <b>Wilson</b> experimented with new studio techniques and became associated with the counterculture. The counterculture was a movement that embraced political activism, and was closely connected to the hippie subculture. The hippies were associated with folk rock, country rock, and psychedelic rock. Folk and country rock {{were associated with the}} rise of politicized folk music, led by Pete Seeger and others, especially at the Greenwich Village music scene in New York. Folk rock entered the mainstream {{in the middle of the}} 1960s, when the singer-songwriter Bob Dylan began his career. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributes The Beatles' shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid-1960s to Bob Dylan's influence at the time. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands and soft, folky singer-songwriters. Psychedelic rock was a hard-driving kind of guitar-based rock, closely associated with the city of San Francisco. Though Jefferson Airplane was the only local band to have a major national hit, the Grateful Dead, a country and bluegrass-flavored jam band, became an iconic part of the psychedelic counterculture, associated with hippies, LSD and other symbols of that era. Some say that the Grateful Dead were truly the most American patriotic rock band to have ever existed; forming and molding a culture that defines Americans today.|$|E
