5|$|Byrd {{resigned}} from the presidency in January 1954 to embark upon an unsuccessful campaign for Governor of Maryland. He narrowly beat perennial candidate George P. Mahoney in the Democratic primary by 50.64% to 49.37% and faced Republican incumbent McKeldin in the general election. Byrd campaigned on his stance of separate <b>but</b> <b>equal.</b> McKeldin won comfortable majorities in Baltimore's black, Jewish, and upper-middle class white districts, while Byrd took all of the blue-collar white South and East Baltimore neighborhoods, including McKeldin's boyhood home along Eutaw Street. Elsewhere in the state, however, middle-class white voters did not support Byrd. Byrd lost by 54.46% to 45.54%. He went on to make unsuccessful bids for the Democratic nominations to the U.S. Senate in 1964 and the U.S. Congress in 1966.|$|E

25|$|As {{for public}} schooling, no states during {{this era of}} Reconstruction {{actually}} required separate schools for blacks. However, some states (e.g. New York) gave local districts discretion to set up schools that were deemed separate <b>but</b> <b>equal.</b> In contrast, Iowa and Massachusetts flatly prohibited segregated schools ever since the 1850s.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the state}} did not appeal the ruling in the federal courts, this state ruling under the U.S. Constitution {{was the first to}} {{overturn}} Plessy v.

25|$|Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia, – In a 7-to-1 ruling, Reed {{applied the}} undue burden {{standard}} to a Virginia law which required separate <b>but</b> <b>equal</b> racial segregation in public transportation. Reed {{found that the}} law created an undue burden because uniformity of law was essential in certain interstate activities, such as transportation.|$|E

Liu Bei's treatment towards Sun Qian was second to that of Mi Zhu, <b>but</b> <b>equal</b> to that of Jian Yong and others. Sun Qian died not long later. Sun Qian's year of death was not specified, but the Australian sinologist Rafe de Crespigny estimated that he died around 214.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} Supreme Court {{decisions}} developed the state action constraint on the Equal Protection Clause. The state action theory weakened {{the effect of}} the Equal Protection Clause against state governments, in that the clause was held not to apply to unequal protection of the laws caused in part by complete lack of state action in specific cases, even if state actions in other instances form an overall pattern of segregation and other discrimination. The separate <b>but</b> <b>equal</b> theory further weakened {{the effect of the}} Equal Protection Clause against state governments.|$|E
25|$|In Ireland, {{the delay}} in finding a {{resolution}} to the home rule issue, partly caused by the war, {{as well as the}} 1916 Easter Rising and a failed attempt to introduce conscription in Ireland, increased support for separatist radicals. This led indirectly to the outbreak of the Irish War of Independence in 1919. The creation of the Irish Free State that followed this conflict in effect represented a territorial loss for Britain that was all <b>but</b> <b>equal</b> to the loss sustained by Germany, (and furthermore, compared to Germany, a much greater loss in terms of its ratio to the country's prewar territory). Despite this, the Irish Free State remained a dominion within the British Empire.|$|E

25|$|To {{add this}} capability, they adapted a concept from the Coast Defense radars being {{developed}} by Butement. The idea was to use two antennas that are aimed in slightly different directions, but with their sensitive areas slightly overlapping down the centreline of the two. The result is a reception pattern where each of the antennas produces a maximum signal when the target is slightly {{to one side of}} the centreline, while a target located exactly in the middle would produce a slightly smaller <b>but</b> <b>equal</b> signal on both antennas. A switch is used to alternate the signals between the two antennas, sending them to the same receiver, amplifier and CRT. One of the signals is also sent through a delay, so its blip is drawn slightly offset.|$|E
25|$|The cell-first {{parallel}} {{projection of}} the 24-cell into 3-dimensional space has a cuboctahedral envelope. Two of the octahedral cells, the nearest and farther from the viewer along the W-axis, project onto an octahedron whose vertices lie {{at the center of}} the cuboctahedron's square faces. Surrounding this central octahedron lie the projections of 16 other cells, having 8 pairs that each project to one of the 8 volumes lying between a triangular face of the central octahedron and the closest triangular face of the cuboctahedron. The remaining 6 cells project onto the square faces of the cuboctahedron. This corresponds with the decomposition of the cuboctahedron into a regular octahedron and 8 irregular <b>but</b> <b>equal</b> octahedra, each of which is in the shape of the convex hull of a cube with two opposite vertices removed.|$|E
25|$|Segregation {{in sports}} in the United States was also a major {{national}} issue. In 1900, just {{four years after the}} US Supreme Court separate <b>but</b> <b>equal</b> constitutional ruling, segregation was enforced in horse racing, a sport which had previously seen many African American jockeys win Triple Crown and other major races. Widespread segregation would also exist in bicycle and automobile racing. In 1890, however, segregation would lessen for African-American track and field athletes after various universities and colleges in the northern states agreed to integrate their track and field teams. Like track and field, soccer was another which experienced a low amount of segregation {{in the early days of}} segregation. Many colleges and universities in the northern states would also allow African Americans on to play their football teams as well.|$|E

25|$|A {{controversy}} {{dating from}} 1999 {{has been over}} the adoption of civil unions, an institution which grants same-sex couples nearly all the rights and privileges of marriage at the state, but not federal, level. In Baker v. Vermont (1999), the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that, under the Constitution of Vermont, the state must either allow same-sex marriage or provide a separate <b>but</b> <b>equal</b> status for them. The state legislature chose the second option by creating the institution of civil union; the bill {{was passed by the}} legislature and signed into law by Governor Howard Dean. In April 2009 the state legislature overrode governor Jim Douglas's veto to allow same-sex marriage, becoming the first state in the nation to legalize same-sex marriage through legislation. In September 2009 Vermont became the fourth state in which same-sex couples could marry.|$|E
25|$|Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, – This was {{recognized}} as a critical case even before it reached the Supreme Court. Chief Justice Earl Warren, realizing how controversial the case {{would be for the}} public, very much wanted to avoid any dissents in the case. But Reed was the lone hold-out. Other members of the Supreme Court worried about Reed's commitment to civil rights, as {{he was a member of}} the (then) all-white Burning Tree Club in Washington, D.C., and his Kentucky home had an all-white restrictive covenant (a covenant which had led Reed to recuse himself from a civil rights case in 1948). Yet, Reed had written the majority decision in Smith v. Allwright and joined the majority in Sweatt v. Painter, , which barred separate <b>but</b> <b>equal</b> racial segregation in law schools. Reed originally planned to write a dissent in Brown, but joined the majority before a decision was issued. Many observers, including Chief Justice Warren, believed a unanimous decision in Brown was necessary to win public acceptance for the decision. Reed was the last holdout and reportedly cried during the reading of the opinion.|$|E
25|$|The {{test was}} {{performed}} at 11:00 MST on August 9, 1968 at the Watching Hill blast {{range of the}} Defence Research Establishment Suffield, a permanent facility {{able to carry out}} large HE test up to 500 tons operated by the Defence Research Board. The charge was constructed of 31,676 blocks of TNT of various sizes mainly the 12x12x4 inch typically used in HE tests. Unlike previous 500-ton tests however, the charge was built as a sphere tangent to the ground, which would make it smaller in diameter than the 500-ton hemispheres <b>but</b> <b>equal</b> in yield. Detonation was accomplished with CE/TNT boosters placed in the center. The sphere was supported by styrofoam rings and blocks and once completed resembled a hemisphere atop a cylinder. After detonation, the flame front reached the charge surface in approximately half a second and produced a fireball and destructive overpressures. Debris up to ¾ inch in diameter continued to rain down for almost 8 minutes after detonation in the vicinity of ground zero. The resulting crater measuring 270 feet across filled rapidly with water and was subsequently excavated for studying the ground effects.|$|E
