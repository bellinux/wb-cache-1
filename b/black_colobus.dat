The population has been steadily rising, from 1,547 in 1998 to 3,000 in 2006. Gorillas are also reported to abundant; there are an estimated 6,000 adults in Nki. The park is also home to diurnal primates, such as the threatened crested monkey, De Brazza monkey, and the <b>black</b> <b>colobus,</b> who reportedly only live east of the Dja River.|$|E
25|$|The western lowland gorilla, chimpanzee, <b>black</b> <b>colobus,</b> {{mandrill}} {{and golden}} potto {{have all been}} listed on the IUCN Red List. The riparian areas of the Minkébé forest provide for creatures who require a water habitat, including the dwarf crocodile, spotted-necked otter, crested mangabey, sitatunga, and water chevrotain. The swampy areas interspersed with vegetation also includes habitat for parrots and python. The park contains some animals which are rare in Gabon including the bongo and the giant forest hog.|$|E
25|$|Douala Edéa Wildlife Reserve, a {{wildlife}} reserve in the Littoral Region of Cameroon, {{is located on}} either side of the mouth of the Sanaga River along the shores of the Bight of Biafra opposite the island of Bioko. The reserve was established in 1932. As of 2000, it covered 160,000 hectares (400,000 acres). Cameroon designated the reserve as {{a wildlife}} park for scientific purposes in 1971, Lake Tissongo, a lagoon connected to the south bank of the Sanaga river by a 5 kilometres (3.1mi) tidal channel, is included in the reserve. 80% of the reserve is covered by tropical lowland equatorial forest, and 15% by Atlantic mangrove forests. Fauna include forest elephants, primates (chimpanzees, monkey species such as <b>black</b> <b>colobus),</b> antelopes (sitatunga, blue duiker, etc.), West African manatees, sea turtles, dolphins, crocodiles, alligator, many fish species, terrestrial and water bird species. The red-capped mangabey was reported to be common in the reserve in 1972. The endangered red-eared nose-spotted guenon was reported in the Lombé part of the reserve in densities of 2-3 groups per square kilometers, but populations had dropped elsewhere due to hunting.|$|E
50|$|The Kibira {{is home to}} {{a number}} of primate species, {{including}} chimpanzees and <b>black</b> and white <b>colobus</b> monkeys. The park is managed by the Institut National pour l'Environnement et la Conservation de la Nature (INECN).|$|R

2500|$|The forest {{elephant}} {{is particularly}} important {{to the park and}} is believed by the WWF to contain one of the largest populations in Africa. The lesser forest in the park is inhabited by elephants, gorillas, and various small carnivores, porcupines, squirrels, african golden cats, leopards, giant pangolins, duikers and red river hog. The primary forest is inhabited by creatures such as mandrill, <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> and chimpanzee.|$|E
50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys live in multi-male {{groups of}} 10-20 individuals. The species is {{territorial}} {{and will make}} loud calls to warn other groups away from {{the area in which}} they are feeding. The <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> call is distinctive from other primate species and sounds like a loud 'sneeze' followed by a roaring noise. <b>Black</b> <b>colobus</b> groups are sometimes joined by single male crested mona monkeys (Cercopithecus pogonias). These individuals take part in <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> grooming and socialising and are thought integrate themselves into <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> groups for protection. Colobus monkeys have been known to respond to crested mona monkey alarm calls.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> monkey {{is one of}} five {{recognised}} {{species in}} the Colobus genus. The <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> is the oldest species in this genera and is thought to have diverged 3-4 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|Mark Coreth {{was born}} in London in 1958 and was {{immediately}} dispatched to the family farm in the Kenyan highlands where the Equator ran through the house. <b>Black</b> and white <b>colobus</b> monkeys leapt amongst the branches in the trees behind the house where leopard and cheetah also lived.

40|$|Habitat {{destruction}} and forest fragmentation {{are perhaps the}} largest threats to primate species around the world. While national parks, games reserves, and primate sanctuaries are instrumental in primate conservation, research suggests that some non-governmentally protected forest fragments may also serve as viable habitats for primates. Of course not all primates respond to fragmentation in the same way, but a species’ ability {{to survive in a}} fragment relates to 1) home range size 2) degree of frugivory 3) dietary flexibility and behavioral plasticity and 4) ability to utilize matrix habitats. Here I describe these variables in relation to <b>black</b> and white <b>colobus</b> monkeys while focusing on dietary and behavioral plasticity. In general, <b>black</b> and white <b>colobus</b> monkeys seem well adapted to cope with forest fragmentation compared to other primate species because of their small home ranges, predominantly folivorous diets, and dietary and behavioral flexibility. For 15 days during October and November 2009, I observed two troops of Colobus angolensis palliatus in a small encroached forest fragment in the Western Usambara Mountains of northeastern Tanzania. Utilizing past studies from Preston (2002), Fox (2004), Heinen (2006), and Olsen (2007), this study monitors behavioral changes in terms of activity budgets and feeding effort to analyze stress levels associated with fragmentation. Furthermore, this study explores <b>black</b> and white <b>colobus</b> monkey dietary diversity in terms of tree species and selection ratios. This study suggests Colobus angolensis palliatus exhibit remarkable dietary diversity and may be altering their behavior to cope with increasing food scarcity over time. These characteristics likely contribute to primates’ ability to persist in this forest fragment...|$|R

50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys do {{not have}} a {{specific}} breeding season, but most mating occurs during rainy times of the year. Males reach sexual maturity at age 6, in females this occurs at age 4. Females {{do not have}} a sexual swelling as seen in other primate species and give birth to a single baby after a gestation period of around 195 days. Females have a baby every 20 months on average. <b>Black</b> <b>colobus</b> babies are born with brown fur and become black, unlike all other Colobus species, which are born with white fur. Allomothering, when other members of the group help mothers to care for their babies, is relatively rare in the <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> monkey. <b>Black</b> <b>colobus</b> babies are carried around by the mother and spend time playing {{with other members of the}} group as they grow in order to learn and socialise.|$|E

50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> monkey {{is a large}} {{species with}} a head-body length of 50-70 cm and a long tail of around 80 cm. As in all Colobus species, the <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> has a slender build and ischial callosities - tough pads of skin on the rump. There is little sexual {{dimorphism}} between the two sexes - adult males can weigh between 10-15 kg, whilst females weigh between 10-11 kg. The <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> is covered in black fur apart from the ears and face, and has longer hairs on its cheeks and forehead. Unlike other species of colobus monkey, black colobuses have no white markings. The two subspecies of <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> look very similar, although the fur of Colobus s. satanas is slightly longer and fluffier.

50|$|When {{body weight}} is {{controlled}} for, specialist feeders such as insectivores and frugivores have larger home ranges than generalists like some folivores (leaf eaters). Because their food source is less abundant, {{they need a}} bigger area for foraging. An example comes from the research of Tim Clutton-Brock, who found that the <b>black</b> and white <b>colobus,</b> a folivore generalist, needs a home range of only 15ha. On the other hand, the more specialized red colobus monkey has a home range of 70 ha, which it requires to find patchy shoots, flowers and fruit.|$|R
50|$|Opened by HRH Duke of Edinburgh in March 2007, Gorilla Kingdom {{is home to}} a {{group of}} six western lowland gorillas, and {{consists}} of a moated island with an indoor gym for the gorillas to use. London Zoo currently owns six gorillas: a silver-back male named Kumbuka, three adult females named Zaire, Mjuuku and Effie, an infant female named Alika (the daughter of Mjuuku and Kumbuka), born in December 2014 and infant male born November 2015. The Gorilla Kingdom area also features smaller enclosures housing Diana monkeys, <b>black</b> and white <b>colobus,</b> sooty mangabeys, Celebes crested macaque and Congo peafowl.|$|R
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> monkey {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{threatened}} primate species in Africa and is currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. This is because the species’ population has declined by over 30% in the past 30 years. The subspecies C.s.satanas is classified as Endangered as its population has declined by over 60% in the last 30 years. The <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> monkey is now only found in areas which cannot be easily accessed by humans.|$|E
50|$|The {{species has}} faced {{population}} declines due to logging and illegal hunting for the fur trade {{which began in}} the 19th century. Due to improved roads and increased wealth in the area, commercial hunting for the species has become more profitable. Today, <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys are mainly traded for their meat and account for 20% of the bushmeat sold in Malabo, the capital of Equatorial Guinea. One adult <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> carcass is sold for around US $20.42.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> (Colobus satanas), or satanic <b>black</b> <b>colobus,</b> is {{a species}} of Old World monkey {{belonging}} to the genus Colobus. The species is found in a small area of western central Africa. Black colobuses are large, completely covered with black fur, and like all other Colobus monkeys, {{do not have a}} thumb. The species has faced large declines in population due to habitat destruction and hunting by humans, and was consequently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 1994.|$|E

50|$|The zoo has {{gradually}} {{increased the number}} of animal exhibits, but still maintains a policy of having mainly smaller animals. The zoo keeps a range of primates including Sulawesi crested macaques, brown capuchin monkeys, <b>black</b> and white <b>colobus</b> monkeys, and lar gibbons. Other residents include servals, African crested porcupines, Rodrigues fruit bats, Asian small-clawed otters, red pandas, Humboldt penguins, binturongs, Chilean flamingos, fennec foxes, Arabian rock hyraxes, two Bactrian camels named Lofty and Roxy and two new Giant Anteaters. Other exhibits include Pet World, Lemurland, a small farmyard, and a walk-through lorikeet aviary where you can feed nectar to the birds.|$|R
50|$|Zebras, buffaloes, <b>black</b> {{and white}} <b>colobus,</b> blue monkeys, bushbucks, sunis, and leopards {{populate}} the park. The park contains some 350 {{species of birds}} in total, of which 52 are birds of prey. The cliffs in {{the northern end of}} Lake Paradise, in Gof Sokorte Gurda, are home to a number of birds, including Ruppell's griffon vultures, peregrine falcons, mountain buzzards, black kites and African fish eagles. Ducks such as garganeys, southern pochards and teals are found on the lake, which is also home to red-knobbed coots, hamerkops, ibises, purple herons, and yellow-billed storks.On the lower slopes of the forest of the park, marked by scrubland, there are populations of olive baboons, vervet monkeys, Peter's gazelles, beisa oryxes, striped hyenas, caracals and aardwolves.|$|R
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> monkey {{is listed}} under Appendix II of CITES, which restricts {{international}} trade of the species. The species is also listed under Class B of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Further information and data {{is needed to}} in order to help conserve the species. Conservation programs such as the Bioko Biodiversity Protection Program aim to work with local people {{to learn more about the}} <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> monkey and protect it from extinction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys are herbivores {{and feed}} {{predominantly}} on seeds. Their robust, flat teeth {{allow them to}} chew tough seeds easily. This diet means that the species {{plays an important role}} as seed dispersers in the ecosystem. Black colobuses also eat large amounts of leaves, in particular lianas, as well as flowers, buds and unripe fruits. Unlike most primates, Colobus monkeys have multi-chambered ruminant stomachs which allow them to easily digest these leaves. Younger leaves and seeds are preferred, as these are rich in nutrients and contain lower amounts of digestion-inhibiting compounds such as tannin. However, the <b>black</b> <b>colobus</b> monkey can withstand high levels of these poisonous compounds and can therefore eat food that is undigestable to other colobus monkeys. This means they can live in areas unoccupied by other species. <b>Black</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys have also been observed eating soil, which may be to ensure that they have enough minerals such as sodium in their diet.|$|E
50|$|This is rich forest home {{to large}} mammals such as western gorilla, chimpanzees, forest {{elephants}} and African buffalo, {{as well as}} many small mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates.

50|$|Bwindi {{is thought}} to have one of the richest faunal {{communities}} in East Africa. There are an estimated 120 mammal species in the park, of which 10 are primates, and more than 45 are small mammals. The park is important for the conservation of the afromontane fauna, especially species endemic to the western rift valley's mountains. Along with mountain gorillas, species in the park include the common chimpanzee, L'Hoest's monkey, African elephant, African green broadbill, and cream-banded swallowtail, <b>black</b> and white <b>colobus,</b> red-tailed monkeys, vervets, the giant forest hog, and small antelope species. There are also many carnivores, including the side-striped jackal, African golden cat, and African civet http://www.itfc.org/summaries%20theses/MSc%20Andama%20CARNIVORES.doc.The park has more than 350 bird species and more than 200 butterfly species. The fish species in the park's rivers and streams are not well known.|$|R
25|$|A {{wide range}} of fauna can be found within the reserve. Four species of {{primates}} are found, the Eastern Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurtii), the golden monkey, the blue monkey, and the L'Hoest's monkey (also known as mountain monkey). Though not since 2002, a fifth species of primate, the <b>black</b> and white <b>colobus</b> has been reported having been seen. There are currently estimated to be 20 East African chimpanzees in the forest. This is a 54% increase in population size from the 13 chimps in 2008, when the GACP first started. This includes five infants. The average density of chimpanzee nests {{was found to be}} 1.473 per km2 by Dr. Plumptree. Other mammals include the red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), the black front duiker (Cephalophus nigrifrons), the southern tree hyrax (Dendrohyrax arboreus), the serval (Felis serval), and Felis aurata.|$|R
40|$|Analyses {{of plant}} DNA in feces {{provides}} a promising, yet largely unexplored, means of documenting the diets of elusive primates. Here we demonstrate the promise and pitfalls {{of this approach}} using DNA extracted from fecal samples of wild western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and <b>black</b> and white <b>colobus</b> monkeys (Colobus guereza). From these DNA extracts we amplified, cloned, and sequenced small segments of chloroplast DNA (part of the rbcL gene) and plant nuclear DNA (ITS- 2). The obtained sequences were compared to sequences generated from known plant samples and to those in GenBank to identify plant taxa in the feces. With further optimization, this method could provide a basic evaluation of minimum primate dietary diversity even when knowledge of local flora is limited. This approach may find application in studies characterizing the diets of poorly-known, unhabituated primate species or assaying consumer–resource relationships in an ecosystem. Am. J...|$|R
