Because of apparent confusion and error in the identity of <b>bitter</b> <b>melons</b> in the Hawaiian literature, we searched for a database which included collections of both the cultivated and weedy forms of M. charantia.

Based on mean larvae per fruit, the cultivated form produced more melon flies man the weedy form; while based on mean larvae per weight of fruit, the weedy form produced more melon flies. Melon flies in both forms were more abundant at wet, lower elevations than at drier, higher elevations. The data presented here demonstrate that M. charantia serves as a melon fly host in residential, agricultural and forest ecosystems of Hawaii...|$|R

50|$|Citrullus lanatus is a {{plant species}} in the family Cucurbitaceae, a vine-like (scrambler and trailer) {{flowering}} plant originally from sub-Saharan Africa. It is cultivated for its fruit. The subdivision of this species into two varieties, watermelons (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) var. lanatus) and citron melons (Citrullus lanatus var. citroides (L. H. Bailey) Mansf.), originated with the erroneous synonymization of Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai and Citrullus vulgaris Schrad. by L.H.Bailey in 1930. Molecular data including sequences from the original collection of Thunberg and other relevant type material, show that the sweet watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris Schrad.) and the <b>bitter</b> wooly <b>melon</b> Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai are not closely related to each other. Since 1930, thousands of papers have misapplied the name Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.)

40|$|ABSTRACT Plants {{from the}} Momordica genus, Curcubitaceae, {{are used for}} several purposes, {{especially}} for their nutritional and medicinal properties. Commonly known as <b>bitter</b> gourds, <b>melon</b> and cucumber, these plants are characterized by a bitter taste owing to the large content of cucurbitacin compounds. However, several reports have shown an undisputed correlation between the therapeutic activities and polyphenolic flavonoid content. Using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry in combination with multivariate data models such as principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis, three Momordica species (M. foetida Schumach., M. charantia L. and M. balsamina L.) were chemo-taxonomically grouped based on their flavonoid content. Using a conventional mass spectrometric-based approach, thirteen flavonoids were tentatively identified and the three species were found to contain different isomers of the quercetin-, kaempferol- and isorhamnetin-O-glycosides. Our results indicate that Momordica species are overall very rich sources of flavonoids but do contain different forms thereof. Furthermore, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, this is a first report on the flavonoid content of M. balsamina L...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOwing to {{the current}} {{worsening}} situation of the increasing burden of diabetes around the world including Malaysia it is worthwhile to discover non-pharmacological prevention or treatment for it. In {{order to have a}} useful explanation of the efficacy of herbs or nutrients for diabetes; it is desirable to know the effect on the balance between the adipogenesis, adipolysis and glucose uptake in the adipose tissues. Therefore, four herbs namely Orthosiphon stamineus (Cat whisker) (OS), Peronema canescens (Sungkai) (PC), Momordica charantia (<b>Bitter</b> gourd/bitter <b>melon)</b> (MC) and Pithecellobium jiringa (Jering) (PJ) were screened for their antidiabetic properties in in vitro model 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. Water extracts of these herbs were prepared and evaluated for their effects on cell proliferation, adipogenesis, adipolysis and glucose uptake in 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes cells. The aforementioned extracts promoted cell proliferation at a dose of 0. 25 mg/ml which showed more than 90 % viability after 48 hours of treatment. The result of this study indicates that OS extracts significantly (P< 0. 001) increased adipogenesis whereas PC, MC and PJ extracts were not effective compared to control. The extracts from all four plants caused increased lipolysis compared to control. The Extract from OS and PJ significantly (P< 0. 05) stimulated glucose uptake in the cells whereas PC, MC were not effective. When the glucose consumption was compared to control it was significantly (P< 0. 001) increased for all extracts in the medium. The present study provides some important baseline data on the biochemical aspects of the effect induced by the herbs and suggestive of possessing antidiabetic properties which can be exploited for diabetes prevention and associated metabolic dysfunctions...|$|R
