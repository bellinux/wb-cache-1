5|$|The North American <b>brown</b> <b>creeper</b> {{has never}} been {{recorded}} in Europe, but an autumn vagrant {{would be difficult to}} identify, since it would not be singing, and the American species' call is much like that of Eurasian treecreeper. In appearance, <b>brown</b> <b>creeper</b> is more like short-toed than Eurasian, but a vagrant might still not be possible to identify with certainty given the similarities between the three species.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} {{belongs to}} the northern group, along with the North American <b>brown</b> <b>creeper,</b> C. americana, the short-toed treecreeper, C. brachydactyla, of western Eurasia, and, if it is considered a separate species, Hodgson's treecreeper, C. hodgsoni, from the southern rim of the Himalayas.|$|E
5|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>creeper</b> has {{sometimes}} been {{considered to be a}} subspecies of Eurasian treecreeper, but has closer affinities to short-toed treecreeper, and is normally now treated as a full species. Hodgson's treecreeper is a more recent proposed split following studies of its cytochrome b mtDNA sequence and song structure that indicate that it may well be a distinct species from C. familiaris.|$|E
30|$|Our results {{indicate}} that in undisturbed sites, pygmy nuthatches had a high niche breadth (foraging significantly more on the thin branches), while white-breasted nuthatches and <b>brown</b> <b>creepers</b> had similar medium niche breadth values (more often foraged in thick branches and lower trunk, respectively), causing the last two {{to have a high}} niche overlap. In contrast, in disturbed sites, niche breadth and overlap values were similar for all three tree-climbing species. All observed overlaps for both forest types were higher than expected, but expected values in disturbed sites suggest the possibility of competition on these sites. Pygmy nuthatches were more sighted than white-breasted nuthatches and <b>brown</b> <b>creepers</b> in both forest types.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>Creepers</b> prefer mature, moist, {{coniferous}} forests {{or mixed}} coniferous/deciduous forests. They {{are found in}} drier forests as well, including Engelman Spruce and larch forest in eastern Washington. They generally avoid the rainforest of the outer coast.

5|$|Along much of Yosemite's western boundary, {{habitats}} {{are dominated}} by mixed coniferous forests of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, incense cedar, white fir, Douglas fir, and a few stands of giant sequoia, interspersed by areas of black oak and canyon live oak. A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species. Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include black bear, coyote, raccoon, mountain kingsnake, Gilbert's skink, white-headed woodpecker, bobcat, river otter, gray fox, red fox, <b>brown</b> <b>creeper,</b> two species of skunk, cougar, spotted owl, and {{a wide variety of}} bat species.|$|E

25|$|In 2013 {{a team of}} {{researchers}} from the San Diego Natural History Museum completed a five-year survey of the Grinnell Transect, Grinnell's 1908 study of the flora and fauna of Mount San Jacinto. In 60 surveys across 20 sites, they found the forest to be much denser than in Grinnell's time, with the loss of three species including a flying squirrel, and an increase in birds that like thick brush, such as the hermit thrush, the <b>brown</b> <b>creeper</b> and the Townsend's solitaire. The relative lack of leaf litter and decayed ground cover in Grinnell's time was considered to make the occurrence of hot and lasting fires in the forest impossible.

500|$|In September 1891, Beebe began {{attending}} East Orange High School. Although Beebe did {{not formally}} drop {{his first name}} [...] "Charles" [...] until 1915, before attending high school he was already commonly known as [...] "William Beebe", as he would be known from this point onward. During his high school years Beebe developed an interest in collecting animals, particularly after receiving his first gun {{at the age of}} sixteen, and trained himself in taxidermy in order to preserve them. When he was unable to collect a specimen for himself, he often obtained it from a supply house known as Lattin's, or by trading with other collectors. Beebe's first article was published while he was still in high school, a description of a bird called a <b>brown</b> <b>creeper,</b> which appeared in the January 1895 issue of the magazine Harper's Young People.|$|E
50|$|Forested {{parts of}} the {{mountain}} include Sitka spruce, western redcedar, Douglas-fir, and western hemlock.Other plant life native to the mountain are Coptis laciniata, salmonberry, salal, sword fern, Oregon grape, bracken fern, and others.Insects may include millipedes, collembolans, spiders, beetles, and various centipedes. Animals that inhabit the area are weasels, chipmunks. black bears, snowshoe hares and deer.

30|$|Nuthatches, woodpeckers, and <b>brown</b> <b>creepers</b> are all {{considered}} to be tree-climbing birds. They have claws {{that allow them to}} grip onto bark for insect capture. From these bird species, the Sittidae (the nuthatchers and wallcreepers Sitta and Thrichoma) are the sister group to the Certhiidae (the creepers, Certhia and Salpornis) (Sibley and Ahlquist 1990). Certhia americana and bird species from the Sitta genus are common inhabitants of North American temperate forest. These tree climbers show morphological similarities in their beaks (slender, either straight or decurved) and body size (ranging from 11 to 15 cm of total length). Despite this, they may show pronounced spatial segregation of primary foraging microhabitats in a tree. For example, previous studies have shown that pygmy nuthatches (Sitta pygmaea) forage higher up in the tree and use their branches more frequently than the trunk (Stallcup 1968, McEllin 1979). Conversely, white-breasted nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis) forage more often on the trunks (Stallcup 1968, McEllin 1979), as do <b>brown</b> <b>creepers</b> (C. americana) (Willson 1970). In this context, differences in the use of hunting tactics or substrates to find prey items should facilitate niche differentiation in sympatric tree-climbing birds (Cloyed 2014).|$|R

30|$|As predicted, {{the three}} {{sympatric}} tree-climbing bird species partitioned their resources by foraging {{in different parts}} of a tree. We found that in the undisturbed sites, pygmy nuthatches were more frequently seen foraging on the thin branches, while white-breasted nuthatches and <b>brown</b> <b>creepers</b> were seen foraging mostly in the thick branches and lower trunk, respectively. Conversely, in the disturbed sites, the three bird species were more homogeneous with respect {{to the site of the}} tree in which they foraged.
