40|$|In recent years, the {{national}} courts of the EU Member States, {{in an attempt}} to stem the flow of rampant online copyright infringement, have increasingly turned to the issuance of <b>blocking</b> <b>injunctions</b> against the intermediaries whose websites and networks are used by third parties to commit infringements. This article examines the legal framework in place at the EU level with regard to the legality of such injunctive orders, making a distinction between filtering measures, used to detect copyright infringements, and blocking measures, used {{to put an end to}} them. On the basis of that analysis, a detailed examination will be made of the latest CJEU ruling to apply this framework, Case C- 314 / 12, UPC Telekabel Wien GmbH v Constantin Film Verleih GmbH on the lawfulness of open-ended <b>blocking</b> <b>injunctions</b> against internet access providers...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{a phenomenon}} of injunctions against innocent third parties (in a tort law sense). One type of such <b>injunctions,</b> website <b>blocking,</b> is currently appearing in a spotlight around various European jurisdictions {{as a consequence of}} the implementation of Art. 8 (3) of the Information Society Directive and Art. 11 of the Enforcement Directive. Website <b>blocking</b> <b>injunctions</b> are in this paper used only as a plastic and perhaps also canonical example of the paradigmatic shift we are facing. The shift from tort law centric injunctions to in rem injunctions. Author of this paper maintains that the theoretical framework for latter injunctions is not in the law of civil wrongs, but in an old Roman law concept of so called 'in rem actions' (actio in rem negatoria). Thus the term in rem injunctions is coined to describe this concept of injunctions. Besides the theoretical foundations, the paper explains how system of injunctions against innocent parties fits into the private law regulation of negative externalities of on-line technology and also what are expected dangers of derailing injunctions from the tracks of the tort law. The important question of the justification of an extension of the intellectual property entitlements by in rem paradigm, it's limits or other solutions to it however, which is author's PhD project, is left out from the paper...|$|R

[...] In a sixty-page opinion finding that the law violates the Equal Protection Clause and the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution, Judge Reeves notes HB 1523 singles out Leviticus 18 while ignoring Leviticus’s other prohibitions, such as mixing wool and linens.

40|$|In recent years, {{intellectual}} property enforcement by ordering Internet access providers to block infringing websites has been rapidly evolving in Europe. Understandable {{from the perspective}} of rightholders searching for the most efficient ways to stop infringing activities, this increasing tendency to seek for website blocking raises several interrelated legal questions. Those range from the extent to which new enforcement models should burden the freedom to conduct a business of intermediaries to how this practice affects the ability of Internet users to access information of their choice and exercise their freedom of expression in the online environment. Interestingly, the requests for <b>blocking</b> <b>injunctions</b> have also provoked counter-reactions, initiating a “breakthrough” in the European judiciary because of the recognition of user rights as enforceable rights of equal value to those of rightholders. This article approaches these (and other) questions {{from the perspective of}} three fundamental rights that {{play a major role in}} website blocking cases and which, according to judicial practice, need to be balanced against each other: the users’ freedom of expression, the ISPs’ freedom to conduct a business, and the copyright holders’ right to property. To this end, it analyses the recent key decisions on the matter from two major European courts – the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights – reflecting further on their actual and potential impact on national decisions. Using the context of this European case law to elaborate standards applicable in the field of website blocking, this article ultimately questions appropriateness of currently prioritised enforcement strategies, pointing to the need to explore possible alternative solutions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{assesses the}} compatibility {{of the potential}} future UK legislation concerning search engines with Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). It argues that the possible introduction of anti-copyright infringement measures such as promotion and demotion of search results, voluntarily complying with website- <b>blocking</b> <b>injunctions,</b> and removing AutoComplete suggestions, might actually lead to undesirable censorship of legitimate sources of published material, by the private sector. It draws upon multiple primary and secondary sources, including the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) case-law, the Court of Justice of European Union???s (CJEU) case-law, Intellectual Property Adviser Mike Weatherley???s papers on search and piracy and ???follow the money??? initiatives, and Google???s reports. This paper focuses on the three-parts of the ECtHR???s non-cumulative test {{in an effort to}} establish whether the potential future UK legislation concerning search engines: firstly, is ???prescribed by law;??? secondly, pursues one or more legitimate aims included in Article 10 (2) of the ECHR; and thirdly, is ???necessary??? and ???proportionate???, in order to determine whether this constitutes a violation of a subscriber, user and site operator???s right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention. It concludes that unless the implementation of the potential future UK legislation concerning search engines: firstly, was limited in scope; secondly, expressly set out a specific obligation for the UK courts to assess whether the introduction of search result technical measures was necessary; and thirdly, was compliant with the ECtHR necessity, proportionality and adequacy principles, it could infringe part one and part three of the ECtHR???s test, thereby violating subscribers, users and site operators??? Article 10 ECHR rights...|$|R
