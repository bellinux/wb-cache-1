40|$|SummaryPharmaceutical {{companies}} are increasingly imparting {{a lot of}} importance on becoming more sustainable by developing medicines that are having same medicinal value but with reduced environmental impact. Type of packaging of tablets affects the emission generated during packaging of medicines. Selection of an appropriate packaging of medicine also influences the emission added to the environment. This paper aims at the comparison of environmental impacts of {{two different types of}} packaging of tablets viz., PVC blister and aluminium <b>blister</b> <b>packaging.</b> Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is used for this comparison. The study includes stages from Cradle to Gate that is, extraction till the packaging processes focused mainly on manufacturing. The functional unit is taken as material required for packing 1 lakh (100, 000), 500 mg of paracetamol tablets. Primary data is provided by a pharmaceutical formulation industry and secondary data is obtained from a commercial LCA database available in GaBi and from literature. LCA software GaBi 7. 0 is used to carry out the life cycle assessment of both kinds of packaging. Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method, CML 2001, is used in this study. The study indicates that the PVC <b>blister</b> <b>packaging</b> performs better compared to the aluminium <b>blister</b> <b>packaging</b> in most of the impact categories considered.

40|$|A new {{dry powder}} inhaler (DPI) for {{respiratory}} drug delivery was developed. This novel device {{is characterized by}} a micro-dose, passive delivery and multiple doses individually sealed in one replaceable disk. The micro-dose delivery system uses only a small amount of excipient, such as 2 - 3 mg lactose, thereby improving the drug delivery efficiency. The passive delivery method eliminates the need for coordination between breath and device actuation such as the pressure metered dose inhaler (pMDI). Finally, 14 doses on a disk reduce the need to frequently change dosage disks. In addition, each dose is effectively protected by a <b>blister</b> <b>package</b> to minimize damage from moisture and oxygen.

40|$|Introduction. To enhance {{effective}} treatment, {{african nations}} including Ghana changed its malaria treatment policy from monotherapy to combination treatment with artesunate-amodiaquine (AS+AQ). The major challenge to {{its use in}} loose form is adherence. Objective. The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate adherence and treatment outcome among patients treated with AS+AQ combination therapy for acute uncomplicated malaria. Methodology. The study was conducted in two rural districts located in the middle belt of Ghana using quantitative methods. Patients diagnosed with acute uncomplicated malaria as per the Ghana Ministry of Health malaria case definitions were randomly allocated to one of two groups. All patients in both groups were educated about the dose regimen of AS+AQ therapy and the need for adherence. Treatment with AS+AQ was supervised in one group while the other group was not supervised. Adherence was assessed by direct observation of the <b>blister</b> <b>package</b> of AS+AQ left on day 2. Results. 401 participants were randomized into the supervised (211) and unsupervised (190) groups. Compliance in both supervised (95. 7 %) and unsupervised (92. 6 %) groups were similar (P =. 18). The commonest side-effects reported on day 2 among both groups were headaches, and body weakness. Parasite clearance by day 28 was > 95 % in both groups. Discussion/Conclusions. Administration of AS-AQ in both groups resulted in high levels of adherence to treatment regimen among adolescent and adult population in central Ghana.

Herein, the chemical fingerprinting of <b>blister</b> <b>packaging</b> using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of authentic and counterfeit samples of Viagra (R) and Cialis (R) is demonstrated. Fifteen commercial samples (Viagra (R) and Cialis (R)) and thirty two counterfeit samples (Viagra and Cialis) were analyzed, and the FTIR data was subjected to chemometric treatment via unsupervised pattern recognition methods (principal component analysis, and hierarchical cluster analysis) and a supervised pattern recognition method (partial least squares discriminant analysis). ATR-FTIR spectra of the <b>blister</b> <b>packaging</b> of authentic Cialis (R) and counterfeit Cialis samples showed bands at 2976, 2904, 1431, 1326, 1243, 973, 691 and 608 cm(- 1), suggesting the presence of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in its chemical composition. For authentic Viagra (R) and counterfeit Viagra samples, several distinct chemical profiles were observed in the ATR-FTIR spectra. Using unsupervised methods, samples were separated into three large groups: (i) counterfeit Viagra (seven samples made of PVC); (ii) authentic Viagra (R) (three samples made of poly(ethylene terephthalate)); (iii) Cialis (authentic and counterfeit) and some samples of Viagra (thirty seven made of PVC with additives of stearic acid derivatives, butyl hydroxy toluene or bisphenol A). Therefore, this suggests that three different types of forming films {{are used in the}} market for <b>blister</b> <b>packaging</b> used to contain inhibitors of PDE- 5.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: There {{is little}} {{information}} as to what extent adverse drug reactions (ADRs) influence patients' health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). From a pharmacovigilance perspective, capturing and making {{the best use of}} this information remains a challenge. The Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb received about 1800 reports after the packaging of the drug Thyrax(®) (levothyroxine; Aspen Pharma Trading Limited, Dublin, Ireland) changed from a brown glass bottle to a <b>blister</b> <b>package</b> in the Netherlands. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of this study was to}} explore the impact of ADRs on HR-QOL in patients who reported a possible ADR to Lareb in relation to the change in the packaging of the drug Thyrax(®). A secondary objective was to explore factors correlated with change in HR-QOL. METHODS: Patients who reported an ADR in relation to the Thyrax(®) packaging change were included in this study. A web-based adapted version of the COOP/WONCA questionnaire was sent to explore the HR-QOL before versus during the ADR, expressed on a 5 -point scale from no impact (1) to high impact (5). Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to identify factors correlated with change in HR-QOL. RESULTS: Overall, 1167 patients returned the questionnaire (71. 2 % response rate). The difference in HR-QOL was - 0. 8 for physical, - 1. 2 for mental, - 1. 4 for daily activities, - 1. 3 for social, and - 1. 3 for overall health status (p < 0. 001 for each domain). Age, sex, educational level of the patient, and absence from work due to an ADR were correlated with at least one domain, while severity of the ADR was found to be correlated with all domains of HR-QOL. CONCLUSION: Patients who reported possible ADRs after the Thyrax(®) packaging change experienced a significant decrease in HR-QOL. This impact was highest for the domains 'daily activities', 'overall health status', and 'mental health' and lowest for 'physical fitness'...|$|E

METHODS: Research {{in the area of}} objective therapy compliance measurement has {{led to the development of}} microprocessor-driven systems that record the time a unit dose is removed from <b>blister</b> <b>packaging.</b> One device under development is the Smart Blister-a label imprinted with event-detection circuitry that can be affixed to standard commercial blister cards. In the first trial of the device in actual clinical practice, 115 community-dwelling Dutch patients receiving valsartan maintenance therapy (160 mg once daily) were given 14 -day <b>blister</b> <b>packages</b> equipped with the Smart Blister. On the return of empty blister cards to the 20 participating community pharmacies, the stored information was scanned and downloaded for data analysis and patient counseling purposes. RESULTS: A total of 245 Smart Blister-equipped packages were used by valsartan recipients during the eight-month study. The device was largely effective in recording patient and blister-card identification data and other desired information. However, in 17 % of cases, the Smart Blister system registered multiple tablet-removal events at the same time, presumably indicating unintentional breakage of nearby conductive circuits and the need for design refinements. The Smart Blister-equipped medication cards were generally well received by patients and pharmacies.
