40|$|Abstract. An {{inductive}} query specifies {{a set of}} {{constraints that}} patterns should satisfy. We study a novel type of inductive query that consists of arbitrary boolean expressions over monotonic and anti-monotonic primitives. One such query asks for all patterns that have a frequency of at least 50 on the positive examples and of at most 3 on the negative examples. We investigate {{the properties of the}} solution spaces of boolean inductive queries. More specifically, we show that the solution space w. r. t. a conjunctive query is a version space, which can be represented by its <b>border</b> <b>sets,</b> and that the solution space w. r. t. an arbitrary boolean inductive query corresponds to a union of version spaces. We then discuss the role of operations on version spaces (and their <b>border</b> <b>sets)</b> in computing the solution space w. r. t. a given query. We conclude by formulating some thoughts on query optimization...|$|R
40|$|Battery {{system is}} the {{key part of the}} {{electric}} vehicle. To realize outlier detection in the running process of battery system effectively, a new high-dimensional data stream outlier detection algorithm (DSOD) based on angle distribution is proposed. First, in order to improve the algorithm stability in high-dimensional space, the method of angle distribution-based outlier detection algorithm is employed. Second, to reduce the computational complexity, a small-scale calculation set of data stream is established, which is composed of normal <b>set</b> and <b>border</b> <b>set.</b> For the purpose of solving the problem of concept drift, an update mechanism for the normal <b>set</b> and <b>border</b> <b>set</b> is developed in this paper. By this way, these hidden abnormal points will be rapidly detected. The experimental results on real data sets and battery system simulation data sets demonstrate that DSOD is more efficient than Simple variance of angles (Simple VOA) and angle-based outlier detection (ABOD) and is very suitable for the evaluation of battery system safety...|$|R
40|$|Border Identification (BI) algorithms, {{a subset}} of Prototype Reduction Schemes (PRS) aim {{to reduce the number}} of {{training}} vectors so that the reduced <b>set</b> (the <b>border</b> <b>set)</b> contains only those patterns which lie near the border of the classes, and have sufficient information to perform a meaningful classification. However, one can see that the true border patterns (“near” border) are not able to perform the task independently as they are not able to always distinguish the testing samples. Thus, researchers have worked on this issue so as to find a way to strengthen the “border” set. A recent development in this field tries to add more border patterns, i. e., the “far” borders, to the <b>border</b> <b>set,</b> and this process continues until it reaches a stage at which the classification accuracy no longer increases. In this case, the cardinality of the <b>border</b> <b>set</b> is relatively high. In this paper, we aim to design a novel BI algorithm based on a new definition for the term “border”. We opt to select the patterns which lie at the border of the alternate class as the border patterns. Thus, those patterns which are neither on the true discriminant nor too close to the central position of the distributions, are added to the “border” <b>set.</b> The <b>border</b> patterns, which are very small in number (for example, five from both classes), selected in this manner, have the potential to perform a classification which is comparable to that obtained by well-known traditional classifiers like the SVM, and very close to the optimal Bayes’ bound...|$|R
