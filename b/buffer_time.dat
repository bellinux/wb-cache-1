Numerous indicators have been proposed by individual operational organizations and the research community dependent on specific objectives and resource constraints. <b>Buffer</b> <b>time</b> based indicators are highly desirable since they enable evaluation of the reliability impacts on passengers from an operational approach.

Different incidences or breakdowns, for example, initial data could change or some resources could become unavailable, may eventually cause the infeasibility of the obtained schedule.

30|$|Timetable {{performance}} measures are reliability, punctuality and robustness. Reliability {{is the ability}} of a system or a component to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time [47]; punctuality is usually defined as the probability of a train arriving less than x minutes late [48]; and robustness refers to the capability of avoiding delay propagation as much as possible [49]. A robust timetable is generally designed by suitably introducing <b>buffer</b> <b>times</b> for absorbing potential delays. However, it is necessary to strike the right balance between the use of railway capacity and the robustness of the timetable [50, 51, 52, 53]: with an increase in <b>buffer</b> <b>times,</b> the timetable presents greater flexibility and thus an increased chance of absorbing delays, avoiding their spread.

40|$|Traffic {{incidents}} are recognised {{as one of}} the key sources of non-recurrent congestion that often leads to reduction in travel time reliability (TTR), a key metric of roadway performance. A method is proposed here to quantify the impacts of traffic incidents on TTR on freeways. The method uses historical data to establish recurrent speed profiles and identifies non-recurrent congestion based on their negative impacts on speeds. The locations and times of {{incidents are}} used to identify incidents among non-recurrent congestion events. <b>Buffer</b> <b>time</b> is employed to measure TTR. Extra <b>buffer</b> <b>time</b> is defined as the extra delay caused by traffic incidents. This reliability measure indicates how much extra travel time is required by travellers to arrive at their destination on time with 95 % certainty {{in the case of an}} incident, over and above the travel time that would have been required under recurrent conditions.

The estimation results reveal that models with random parameters offer a superior statistical fit for all types of incidents, suggesting the presence of unobserved heterogeneity across segments.

Capacity consumption together with the homogeneous level of train traffic gives {{a picture of the}} efficient use of infrastructure. Previous research suggests that the utilization is more efficient with a homogeneous operating program. During last decades, many researchers tried to describe and/or define the homogeneity of operating programs in rail service; however, no definition considered the infrastructure occupation. In addition, several methods were developed to evaluate the homogeneity in railway operation considering variations in speed, running time and headway. But, the occupancy of infrastructure has not been discussed in the existing methods. An extension of existing definitions is presented {{from the perspective of the}} infrastructure, which can be characterized by variations in blocking time, <b>buffer</b> <b>time</b> and running direction. The blocking time, <b>buffer</b> <b>time</b> and running direction describe the occupancy of train path on track sections based on the blocking time model. Accordingly, the homogeneity of operating programs is evaluated through three parameters, namely the homogeneity of blocking time (HBL), the homogeneity of <b>buffer</b> <b>time</b> (HBU) and the homogeneity of running direction (HRD). The overall homogeneity (OH) combined HBL; HBU and HRD to realize an integrity evaluation of homogeneity of operating programs. The results show that this new methodology can quantify the homogeneity of railway operations, not only for track sections but for an entire network, which contributes significantly to the efficient utilization of infrastructure. With the method developed in this thesis, the interrelationship between homogeneity of operating programs and operation quality were investigated quantitatively. Firstly, both the influence of each parameter of homogeneity and the overall homogeneity were analyzed. The operation quality (delay-coefficient) is evaluated for timetables with different train types, arrangements of buffer times and sequences of train runs. The results show that the operation quality deteriorates with less homogeneous timetables, in which the variation in <b>buffer</b> <b>time</b> has a more significant influence. Finally, the influence of homogeneity of operating programs is studied for different traffic flows. The low traffic flow is more sensitive to the homogeneity of <b>buffer</b> <b>time</b> and the homogeneity of blocking time is more significant for high traffic flow...|$|E

40|$|A {{critical}} problem {{faced by}} railways {{is how to}} increase capacity without investing heavily in infrastructure and impacting on schedule reliability. One way of increasing capacity {{is to reduce the}} <b>buffer</b> <b>time</b> added to timetables. <b>Buffer</b> <b>time</b> is used to reduce the impact of train delays on overall network reliability. While reducing buffer times can increase capacity, it also means that small delays to a single train can propagate quickly through the system causing knock-on delays to trains impacted by the delayed train.

This leaves little space for control by process operators by which a delayed train can cause severe delay propagation. The NS currently invest a large amount in punctuality improvement of the railway operations. This paper shows how the effect of delays can already be incorporated in the timetable design process to obtain robust and optimized timetables for a punctual and reliable operation. A detailed modelling approach is presented to compute periodic network timetables with an optimal distribution of buffer times at those points where they are needed the most without being too conservative. The variables are the buffer times and the proposed objective is to minimize a weighted sum of individual costs for each <b>buffer</b> <b>time.</b> Here, the weights define {{the relative importance of}} the <b>buffer</b> <b>time</b> costs. The following cost functions are proposed and proved to be convex for general running time distributions: <b>buffer</b> <b>time</b> (fast travel times for through passengers and small operating costs); expected delay due to <b>buffer</b> <b>time</b> failure of rolling-stock and crew connections (increasing punctuality) and train circulations (stability of train circulations); and expected transfer waiting time (trade-off between small transfer times and transfer reliability). The constraints on a feasible timetable are modelled conveniently by time window constraints concerning interactions between two periodic events (arrivals and departures). This is compatible with the timetable design system DONS of the NS. For the optimization problem these constraints are reformulated using the buffer times as variables rather than the periodic event times. The resulting cycle constraints state that the oriented sum of process and buffer times on fundamental cycles of the constraint graph is a multiple of the cycle time. The buffer times are not periodic by which they can be used straightforwardly in the objective functions. The periodic time windows are thus replaced by periodic cycles.

Moreover, ever increasing air traffic, rising costs and tighter environmental targets create a pressure to minimise fuel burn on the ground. However, current routing functions envisioned in Advanced Surface Movement, Guidance and Control Systems (A-SMGCS) almost exclusively consider the most time efficient solution and apply a conservative separation to ensure conflict free surface movement, sometimes with additional <b>buffer</b> <b>times</b> to absorb small deviations from the taxi times. Such an overly constrained routing approach may result in either a too tight planning for some aircraft so that fuel efficiency is compromised due to multiple acceleration phases, or performance could be further improved by reducing the separation and <b>buffer</b> <b>times.</b> In light of this, Part 1 and 2 of this paper present a new Active Routing framework with the aim of providing a more realistic, cost effective and environmental friendly surface movement, targeting some of the busiest international hub airports.

The proposed approach represents the first attempt to systematically address speed profiles with competing objectives.
