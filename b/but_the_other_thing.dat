First they {{concentrated on the}} music of Heinrich Schütz and made it known in Heilbronn and the region.

Vocal soloists have included Agnes Giebel, Edith Selig, Claudia Hellmann, Barbara Scherler, Hertha Töpper, Theo Altmeyer, Kurt Huber, Helmut Krebs, Jakob Stämpfli, Barry McDaniel, Bruce Abel and Franz Kelch, instrumental soloists Maurice André (trumpet), Hermann Baumann (horn), Marie-Claire Alain (organ) and György Terebesi (violin). Orchestras for the recordings have included the Pforzheim Chamber Orchestra, the Württembergisches Kammerorchester Heilbronn and the Südwestfunk Orchester. Werner's Bach recordings were compared to those of his contemporary Karl Richter.

40|$|Supporting {{domestic}} producers Cue: In {{many parts of}} Africa, local poultry producers have been swamped by floods of cheap chicken coming in from Europe. In the case of The Gambia, in West Africa, the domestic market has been devastated by meat from Belgium and Holland, which is so cheap that many carcasses are simply dumped unsold. In a liberalised trade environment, {{it may be difficult}} for national governments to protect {{domestic producers}}. However, creating a supportive structure for local industry can at least give it a chance of competing with the European rivals. Mamadi Ceesay is the Deputy Permanent Secretary at the Gambian Department of State for Agriculture, and the author of a recent report on the impact of liberalisation on the poultry industry. He spoke to Ismaila Senghore about how local farmers have been affected by the open market, and how he feels they could be increasing their competitiveness. IN:		?Most of the people who ? OUT:		?Thank you very much, Ismaila. ? DUR?N	 5 ? 07 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That report came from Ismaila Senghore in The Gambia. Transcript Ceesay	Most {{of the people who were}} in the industry by 1996 were out by 2000. Only a few managed to stay. And this was because the market was in glut, because they could afford to bring in products at cheaper price, even though this will take six weeks to reach the Gambia, and this has an effect on the quality. If you have to bring in products for six weeks, the quality is less than if you have it produced in the Gambia. So in terms of those Gambian companies, they are disfavoured, and therefore had it very tough to compete. Senghore	Well Mamadi, I?m a Gambian myself, and I have been into the streets and in the markets, and it appears that in every corner, sometimes we find chicken legs, whole chickens, on sale at very cheap prices. This means definitely, local farmers cannot sell their poultry products. So how far do you think subsidisation of industrialised countries in their agriculture has impacted local farmers? Ceesay	They can afford to bring in products that are even lower than the cost of production here. And because of that, a lot of people in the industry had to go out of business because they had to compete with these people in the same market, and their products are readily available, and they are at a cheaper price. I think the only other option is that people who go for quality go for what is produced locally here, because it is more tasty, and less of the health risk. But these are the problems, because if you look at the people of low income, they will readily go for a product which is of a lower price and which is readily available in the market. What this does is that the local poultry industry can never flourish, and therefore we have to depend on imports. So we find ourselves in a vicious circle and it is very difficult to escape from it, and therefore the food insecurity situation continues. Senghore	Have you looked at some of the basic problems that farmers need to be able to compete with these imports? Ceesay	I think it is to support, particularly the small-scale farmers, through the rehabilitation of the hatcheries, but also through the rehabilitation of the feed industry that we have, in terms of producing local feeds to make sure that is available to farmers. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> one needs to do is step up the surveillance that we have, to make sure that the product that we have are of quality, to ensure that the laboratories that are around have the necessary agents and the equipment so that the population at large is protected. I think that if we provide all this, it will go a long way to providing the environment for the local industry. Because in the state of the liberalised environment, one cannot talk about protection, but one can support the industry and enable it to grow. Senghore	What kind of advice do you think our local farmers can follow, in order to improve the situation? Ceesay	I think the key advice is cost effectiveness. We have to go for products that are locally available: use locally available feed because we have the maize; all we have to do is bring in a few vitamins and other nutrients, and supplement this. We also have to develop the local hatcheries that are available so that we don?t have to import day-old chicks from Europe. And we also have a very good climate, where we can have simple, low-cost housing in which the poultry can be reared. I think using these mechanisms, we can operate and provide enough poultry products for the urban areas and for the families of rural Gambians. Senghore	Mamadi, I do believe you enjoy chicken? Ceesay	Very much thank you. Senghore	Do you foresee us enjoying chicken in the near future as much as we used to do? Ceesay	I think, first we are in a global environment, so we will have just to continue importing chicken. I think this can be complemented by the local industry in providing locally produced chicken, which are more delicious, of course, than the imported one, and I think more and more people are in for quality food. And in the search for quality food, I think people will go in for the local products, at the expense of course, of the imported chicken. Senghore	Well I always go for the local produce, seeing as it is more delicious. Thank you very much Mamadi, it has been a pleasure talking to you, and thank you for the time. Ceesay	Thank you very much, Ismaila. End of track. The Deputy Permanent Secretary in the Gambian Department of State for Agriculture, explains how imported chicken from Europe has affected local poultry production in The Gambia, and how both government supports and changing management by farmers could restore local competitiveness...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{biosecurity}} when outbreaks occur Cue: Cross-border {{trade in}} poultry and poultry products {{is big business}} in much of Africa. However despite being {{a good source of}} income for the traders, and a valuable source of meat and eggs for consumers, there can be risks in this cross-border trade. Spreading disease from one country to another is one risk. For example, when Nigeria first experienced outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian flu in early 2006, neighbouring countries became very concerned. For this reason, when outbreaks of contagious livestock disease occur, governments can decide to impose a ban on all imports of the livestock concerned, at least until the outbreak is controlled. However, few governments are can make import bans completely effective; they lack the trained staff to do it. Controlling movements of livestock within a country is even more difficult. But controlling diseases like avian flu is in everyone?s interest, and it is everyone?s responsibility to prevent the disease spreading. Farmers, for instance, must know {{the right thing to do}} if they suspect one or more of their birds has caught or died from the virus. In a recent interview, Excello Zidana spoke to Michael Nkosi, a lecturer at Malawi?s Natural Resources College, and began by asking what farmers should do if one of their birds shows symptoms of the virus. IN:		?I would advise that the ?? OUT:		??Thank you very much. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 56 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: And asking the questions was Excello Zidana. The interview comes from a radio resource pack on avian flu produced by CTA. Transcript Nkosi	I would advise that the first thing that farmers should do is actually to report to the nearest veterinary station. That is the first thing, so that maybe officers should come, verify the signs and symptoms, if there is need undertake sampling, take birds to the lab and then they would do analysis. But unfortunately in Malawi we may not have the capacity to test for avian influenza. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> that farmers need to do is to intensify bio-security measures. They should not just allow their workers to move from house to house if they have several units of birds. Maybe they should allocate specific attendants to a specific house so that the virus is not passed on to safe birds. Zidana		How does the virus spread? Nkosi	The virus can spread in many ways. It could be from inanimate objects like farm equipment. If you just borrow feeders from any how, drinkers from any unknown farm you can spread the virus. From clothes of people, boots [...] . So I should emphasise that protective wear is very important and should be specific to a unit. Zidana	Let?s look at the handling of the sick birds, how does a farmer handle sick birds from his farm? Nkosi	One, he should first of all isolate the sick birds, confine them separately. But at the same time he should put on protective wear, even a mask if it is available, because you never know, he maybe working with a strain of avian influenza virus that can affect man. So you need to be protected whether it is confirmed or not. Zidana	And if this farmer wants his dead birds to be tested from any lab around, how does he carry the dead bird? Nkosi	He can put the birds in a plastic bag that is having no holes or double plastic bag, the whole live bird push it there and then transport it to the lab. As I said earlier on that in this country we do not have the capacity to examine and diagnose for this virus. Then the lab knows how to safely package international samples to referral labs. Zidana	Now let?s turn to disposing of the dead birds. How should the process of disposing of the dead birds carried out? Nkosi	If it is by mass slaughter, if it is the government policy to say we want to control the outbreak by mass slaughter, one, you can bury very deep: two metres deep, three metres. Or you can dig a shallow pit and then push all the birds there, put diesel and then burn. Zidana		Why three metres Mr Nkosi? Nkosi	Because some carnivores like dogs, cats, jackals, they can jump into a shallow pit, lift the animal and then they can scavenge and spread the virus. Zidana	People who know avian flu very well have indicated that the virus can survive in birds? droppings. What measures should be taken when using items such as cages, bicycles or even vehicle tyres trying to go to an area where people suspect that there could be this outbreak? Nkosi	The first thing is to institute wheel baths just outside the farm. You need to have a wheel bath that has disinfectant and as the vehicle is moving across all the manure will remain there. But at the same time you need to spray the whole vehicle canopy, even the tyres, so that you do not take the manure. Because you never know, you can carry the virus. About the facilities like cages, you need to decontaminate and remove all the manure if it is there, so that you move a safe product. Zidana	In countries like Malawi, Zambia, Uganda, Kenya, people know that birds migrate from one region to another. Are there special rules to guard maybe the movement of wild birds from one country to another, as a region or as a continent? Nkosi	That is a very tricky question. You know natural birds, you cannot govern them, but you definitely know the routes that they take from one continent to the other. The only bet is actually to avoid contact of domesticated birds with the wild birds along the shores of Lake Malawi or any other ocean in this region. We need to advise our farmers, maybe to intensively rear birds that are domestic to avoid that contact. Zidana	Lastly how or what do you advise people involved in business of poultry, cross-border business people trying to bring in maybe birds or meat from birds? What do you advise them to do if they are doing that in the event of rumours that there should be avian flu within the region? Nkosi	The only advice that I can give is they need to follow proper protocol. Get all the licenses for importation. They should desist from smuggling because avian influenza can not only affect their consumers; even themselves if it is brought into this country, we are all at risk. So what we need to do is desist from smuggling or black marketing and then follow proper channels. Zidana	That was Mr Michael Nkosi who is an Animal Scientist at Natural Resources College, thank you Mr Nkosi. Nkosi		Thank you very much. End of track.

40|$|Promoting {{fruit tree}} {{cultivation}} Cue: While the planting {{of trees in}} homesteads and crop land is a traditional practice in many areas, in other places it is a more recent innovation. And even though the benefits of trees on farms are now widely recognised, organisations that aim to spread agroforestry techniques still have to plan their approach carefully. In Botswana, for example, an NGO called the Forestry Association has, since 1983, been working to reverse the destruction of natural woodland. One recent project has been the promotion of fruit trees on homesteads. But getting a ?new? technology like this widely accepted has required the organisation to work through local chiefs and through schools, as well as offering incentives to the farmers themselves. Lesoga Motoma, Executive Director of the Association spoke to Busani Bafana about the work. IN:		?Farmers like to develop. ? OUT:		?. acquired from primary level and secondary level. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 45 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Lesoga Motoma, Executive Director of the Forestry Association of Botswana, was talking to Busani Bafana. Transcript Motoma 	Farmers like to develop but then the question sometimes is the practicability of those methods whether {{they can afford to}} do that. Taking into consideration that the land which they have been given are just small plots, but they would need a larger chunk in its entirety. Unless they come together as communities in woodland management projects - be it agroforestry or anything - but when they come together then they can be able to get larger chunks of land to manage sustainably. Busani	You have talked about the challenge that has faced your Association, in effect promoting a fully fledged agroforestry. But you have recorded some successes in planting indigenous trees even for orchards. Tell us briefly about that. Motoma	I wouldn?t say for orchards, that is a big thing. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> that we have done which is still in the line of agroforestry is the homestead one, where people planted trees in their own homesteads. They would plant three indigenous species, one of which would be a fruit tree and they would plant two exotic species, one of which would be a fruit tree. And in that way, that was the agroforestry of the home, which would also provide shade, it would provide some form of firewood, it would also provide some form of soil fertility. We are encouraging Batswana people to plant the indigenous species so that they can maximise the benefits from them. The benefits mainly being that they don?t have to water them as much, they are frost resistant when they are in their right environment. They can withstand the termites, the poor nutrition of the soil also is OK for them because they sink their roots quite deep. They can also stand the drought because they tap water from quite deep. So that?s basically what we are encouraging the farmers, even at their homes, to do. We are not only limiting ourselves to big farmers; even the upcoming ones in schools we are also targeting and we are encouraging all the facets of agroforestry in the schools, and also targeting the teachers to teach agroforestry as they teach their agriculture curricula. Busani	I notice in the summary of the Association?s performance you indicate that to date we have planted indigenous trees in the 64 villages in approximately 7, 250 households through the Home Tree Planting Programme. How easy has this been to get the involvement of the communities? Motoma	I would say we were successful because we approached it the traditional way. We went through the chiefs and we used the Kotla system. The Kotla system is where the local gathering area that is called by the chief. So that is how we would come in. And people would embrace this around the home tree planting, and then that?s when we would discuss on how best to do it. And that is how we have been successful. Although since people didn?t quite believe so much in indigenous tree planting, at the beginning when they started they would take care more of the exotic species than the indigenous. But because we also had incentives for those who had 100 % or 80 % survival some would just go along so that they get those incentives, which were two grafted citrus fruits. And because they wanted that they would take care of the indigenous species as well. And in that way since the indigenous species would only need that one year to be taken care of, then they would get established and thereafter need not much attention. And that?s how we have managed to succeed. But we lost out on those who were sceptical at the beginning or the laggards who would come after everybody else had gone because by the time they came we had already passed to another village. We wouldn?t go back to the same village the same time. This is one thing that we have learnt that in future we will have to stay in one area for more than a year. Busani	And what does the future hold? What do you hope to do in the future as far as expanding your programmes? Motoma	We still have a lot to do. We {{need to go back to}} communities and get them together because that?s the way to go now. And on agroforestry encourage the inter-cropping of horticulture, trees, both exotic and indigenous because we can?t cast out the exotic trees, there are those ones which are good. We would also like to move aggressively into soil conservation and addressing the energy issue of using fuel wood because now people are cutting live trees for fuel wood and that is very bad for a fragile environment like Botswana. We also would like to continue with the schools - to target primary schools, to target secondary schools so that they grow up with the knowledge of planting trees, of agroforestry and all the interventions of woodland management or environmental management. So that even when they grow up wherever they go to work, whatever career they choose, they would have that basic knowledge in them, having been acquired from primary level and secondary level.

50|$|After this, Twarock entered virology, {{and began}} to rigorously link virus {{structure}} to fundamental ideas in geometry. It was well understood that viruses have icosahedral shape and symmetry, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> only <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> that was said of them was that they sometimes they possessed planar translational symmetry, causing them to resemble goldberg polyhedra. The question of the exceptional nature of papovaviridae had been solved, {{but it was not}} a one-off - HK97 could not be considered a goldberg polyhedron either. Twarock's study of these viruses lead her to believe that there was much more insight into virology that could be gotten from mathematics. Mathematical virology had previously only studied the surfaces of virus, using models that were tilings of the 2-sphere; Twarock hoped to go further than this, to illuminate three-dimensional protein structure and genome packaging.|$|R

[...] "Of course we shall see each other in London. Don't talk of not being in the House. Of course you will be in the House." [...] Then Phineas had shaken his head and smiled. Where was he to find a requisite number of householders prepared to return him? But as he went up to London he told himself that the air of the House of Commons was now the very breath of his nostrils. Life to him without it would be no life. To have come within the reach of the good things of political life, to have made his mark so as to have almost insured future success, to have been the petted young official aspirant of the day,--and then to sink down into the miserable platitudes of private life, to undergo daily attendance in law-courts without a brief, to listen to men who had come to be much below him in estimation and social intercourse, to sit in a wretched chamber up three pairs of stairs at Lincoln's Inn, whereas he was now at this moment provided with a gorgeous apartment looking out into the Park from the Colonial Office in Downing Street, to be attended by a mongrel between a clerk and an errand boy at 17s. 6d. a week instead of by a private secretary who was the son of an earl's sister, and was petted by countesses' daughters innumerable,--all this would surely break his heart. He could have done it, so he told himself, and could have taken glory in doing it, had not these <b>other</b> <b>things</b> come in his way. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> had come. He had run the risk, and had thrown the dice. And now when the game was so nearly won, must it be that everything should be lost at last? ...|$|R

They know they ought to help him and they're too stingy to do it, and they're ashamed of {{themselves}} for that, and they ought also to hate themselves on that account, but instead of that they hate Brady because he makes them ashamed of themselves.

5000|$|Proclus's system, {{like that}} of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Neoplatonists, is a {{combination}} of Platonic, Aristotelian, and Stoic elements. In its broad outlines, Proclus's system agrees with that of Plotinus. However, following Iamblichus, Plutarch of Athens, and his master Syrianus, Proclus presents a much more elaborate universe than Plotinus, subdividing the elements of Plotinus's system into their logically distinct parts, and positing these parts as individual things. This multiplication of entities is balanced by the monism which is common to all Neoplatonists. What this means is that, on the one hand the universe is composed of hierarchically distinct <b>things,</b> <b>but</b> on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> all <b>things</b> are part of a single continuous emanation of power from the One. From this latter perspective, the many distinctions {{to be found in the}} universe are a result of the divided perspective of the human soul, which needs to make distinctions in its own thought in order to understand unified realities. The idealist tendency is taken further in John Scotus Eriugena ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing,</b> {{which is}} <b>the</b> answer that I give {{in my book}} to this objection: But I am not only {{convinced}} of my sins (may some say) but have also some power against my sins; so that I do in some measure abstain from the sins forbidden in the law. And because I say, this thou mayest have and do, as thou thinkest, perfectly too [as thou thinks, mark that] as those fond hypocrites, called Quakers [think] that they also do, and yet be but a natural man. Here my adversary is very much offended, and calls me perverter of the right way of the Lord; and saith, Shew me any natural man in the scripture that hath done it. Whereas had he been but willing to have laid down the scripture I brought to prove it, he needed not to have looked for a second answer. But because he would have it again, I will therefore shew you, that natural men merely by nature may be convinced, and abstain from those things forbidden in the law, and think they do it perfectly, nay, they do the things contained in the law. For saith the apostle (Rom 2:14), [...] "when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature [mark, do by nature] the things contained in the law, these, [the Gentiles] having not the law, are a law unto themselves." [...] Mark; the Gentiles do by nature the things contained in, or held forth, or made mention of by the law; the light also that they have, it is themselves, being a law to themselves; that is, their consciences (being of themselves) bearing them witness and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing, or else excusing one another (verse 15), though they cannot be saved thereby.|$|R
5000|$|By the 1930s, Khrennikov {{was already}} {{treated as a}} leading {{official}} Soviet composer. Typical was his speech during a discussion in February 1936 concerning Pravda articles [...] "Chaos instead of music" [...] and [...] "Ballet falseness":The resolution on 23rd April 1932 appealed to {{the consciousness of the}} Soviet artist. Soviet artists had not withstood scrutiny. After 23rd April, youth was inspired to study. The problem was, we had to master the skills and techniques of composition. We developed an enthusiasm for modern western composers. The names of Hindemith and Krenek came to be symbols of advanced modern artists. … After the enthusiasm for western tendencies came an attraction to simplicity, influenced by composing for the theatre, where simple, expressive music was required. We grew, our consciousness also grew, as well as the aspiration to be genuine Soviet composers, representatives of our epoch. Compositions by Hindemith satisfied us no more. Soon after that Prokofiev arrived, declaring Soviet music to be provincial and naming Shostakovich as the most up-to-date composer. Young composers were confused: on the one hand, they wanted to create simpler music that would be easier for the masses to understand; on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, they were confronted with the statements of such musical authorities as Prokofiev. Critics wrote laudatory odes to Shostakovich. … How did young composers react to Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk? This opera contains several large melodic fragments which opened some creative perspectives to us. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> entre‘actes and <b>other</b> <b>things</b> aroused complete hostility.|$|R
40|$|Since the war, the {{purchasing}} power of corn has fallen 25 percent. In terms of 1913 dollars, corn now is worth only 75 percent {{as much as it}} was before the war. A farmer who sells a load of corn today gets about as much money for it as he used to, it is true; but that money will not buy as much of other goods as it would before the war. The price of corn has gone up since <b>the</b> war, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> prices of <b>other</b> <b>things</b> have gone up more than the price of corn; they have gone up 25 percent more. In actual fact, corn now is worth only 75 percent as much as it was before the war. Figure 1 shows the situation in terms of 1913 dollars. This chart shows that previous to the war {{the purchasing}} power of corn had been rising steadily for many years. The population of the United States was growing rapidly, and the livestock industry was expanding in response to the constantly growing demand for food. This in turn resulted in a continual increase in the demand for corn and other feed grains. Settlers poured into <b>the</b> Middlewest, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> demand for corn increased faster than the supply. The trend of corn purchasing power rose steadily {{from the time of the}} Civil War to the end of the recent World War, at the rate of about 1 / 2 cent per bushel per year...|$|R
5000|$|Direct tax {{subsidies}} of any {{church or}} sect or of all churches and sects are undoubtedly prohibited by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution... A tax exemption is, obviously, an indirect subsidy... {{it is not}} easy to justify logically the tax exemption provisions... a logical and legal justification of such provisions must be found, and... in interpreting such provisions the court should be very careful not to limit them by such a narrow construction that by the very limitations imposed, constitutionality is adversely affected... It is sound public policy to encourage, by tax exemption as well as by direct subsidy, private undertakings in the fields that are properly within the realm of governmental responsibility. Thus, welfare, charitable and private educational grants and subsidies are valid. All churches that warrant the exemption perform some of these tasks. Therefore, churches can be indirectly subsidized for the performance of these tasks. But this indirect subsidy is not for the activities that are peculiarily religious in the sense of dogma or doctrine, <b>but</b> for <b>the</b> many <b>other</b> <b>things</b> all churches do... If the words [...] "religious worship" [...] are given a narrow, limited meaning, so as to require a belief in and adoration of a Supreme Being, then grave doubts would exist as to the constitutionality of the section... If the state cannot constitutionally subsidize religion under the First Amendment, then it cannot subsidize theism. If the state can constitutionally subsidize those functions of religious groups which are not related to [...] "religion" [...] in its narrow sense, then it must subsidize those nontheistic groups which perform the same functions.|$|R
