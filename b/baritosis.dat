40|$|<b>Baritosis</b> {{is one of}} the benign pneumoconioses {{in which}} inhaled {{particulate}} matter lies in the lungs for years without producing symptoms, abnormal physical signs, incapacity for work, interference with lung function, or liability to develop pulmonary or bronchial infections or other thoracic disease. Owing to the high radio-opacity of barium, the discrete shadows in the chest radiograph are extremely dense. Even in the most well-marked cases with extreme profusion of the opacities, massive shadows do not occur. When exposure to barium dust ceases the opacities begin slowly to disappear. Nine cases of <b>baritosis</b> occurring in a small factory in which barytes was crushed, graded, and milled are described. Two of the cases occurred after only 18 and 21 month's exposure, and 9 of the 10 men employed for more than one and a half years had <b>baritosis.</b> Five of the affected men examined at intervals since their exposure to barytes ceased in 1964 showed marked clearing of their radiological abnormalities...|$|E

Centralni higijenski zavod u Sarajevu postavio je sebi zadatak da prouči baritozu s profesionalno-higijenskog. kliničkog i patološko-anatomskog gledišta. Rad obuhvaća anketiranje radilišta sa svim potrebnim tehničkim ispitivanjima (M. BRANISAVLJEVIĆ) i klinički dio, baziran pretežno na rentgenskim pregledima (G. MERKULOV i S. TEOFANOVIĆ) i na jednom patološko-anatomskom proučavanju pluća (Z. KOPAČ). There {{are several}} barite mines in our country. Mining and milling of barite {{through a number}} of years causes <b>baritosis</b> which {{consists}} in pathological changes in the bronchi and the lungs of the workers. The authors examined 31 workers from a barite mill who had been working from 1 - 14 years without any protective measures in a very dusty environment. All complained of cough with much sputum, some of dyspnoea with the clinical signs of an emphysema of the lung. Not one had heart trouble, blood pressure corresponded to age, haemoglobin was without pathological changes, sputum was Kochnegative and urine without pathological findings. Radiography disclosed in the lung of all workers rare, translucent, flocky nodules different from those in miliary tuberculosis or in silicosis. No case was complicated by active tuberculosis or by the influence of the expected silicotic component. The main characteristics of <b>baritosis</b> appeared in three stages according to the dissemination, the translucence {{and the size of the}} nodules. The pathologico-morphological findings of the lung of one such worker who had died of another intercurrent disease pointed to bronchitis chronica catarrhalis. The histological finding gave a picture of ratification of the parenchyme of the lung, of atrophy of the lung interstitium and, specifically, of disseminated nodules. Those changes were an evidence of nodular pneumoconiosis. The postmortem of that case clearly showed that there are considerable histological differences between <b>baritosis</b> and other nodular pneumoconioses. There is a complete absence of nodules composed of fibrous or sclerotic tissue. Barium nodules are mostly built of the pigment of barite and contain very little fibrous fibres...|$|E
40|$|Four men who mined barytes in Scotland and who {{developed}} pneumoconiosis are described. Three developed progressive massive fibrosis, from which two died; and one developed a nodular simple pneumoconiosis {{after leaving the}} industry. The radiological and pathological features of the men's lungs were those of silicosis and high proportions of quartz were found in two of them post mortem. The quartz was inhaled from rocks associated with the barytes in the mines. The features of silicosis in barium miners are contrasted with the benign pneumoconiosis, <b>baritosis,</b> that occurs in workers exposed to crushed and ground insoluble barium salts. Diagnostic difficulties arise when silicosis develops in workers mining minerals known to cause a separate and benign pneumoconiosis. These difficulties are compounded when, as not infrequently happens, the silicotic lesions develop or progress after exposure to quartz has ceased...|$|E
30|$|High-attenuation {{pulmonary}} abnormalities {{can result}} {{from a variety of}} different conditions, including from the deposition of calcium. Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity may cause high-attenuation pulmonary parenchymal opacities. Multiple dense nodular opacities are rarely seen in siderosis, stannosis, talcosis and <b>baritosis,</b> in which iron, tin, talc and barium sulfate respectively are deposited in the lungs. Computed tomography (CT) is highly sensitive in the detection of areas of abnormally high attenuation in the lung parenchyma, airways, mediastinum and pleura. Calcifications in the thorax are frequently manifestations of previous infectious processes. However, they may be due to benign or malign neoplasms, metabolic disorders, or occupational exposure. The cause of the calcifications and other high-attenuation conditions may be determined by means of the location and pattern of the abnormalities within the lung parenchyma and knowledge of the associated clinical features. High-attenuation pulmonary abnormalities can be divided into five main patterns on CT: small hyperdense nodules, large nodules or masses, high-attenuation linear or reticular pattern, high-attenuation consolidation, and high-attenuation extraparenchymal lesions.|$|E
