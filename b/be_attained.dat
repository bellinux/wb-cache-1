5|$|Cloud, a single-player {{video game}} for Microsoft Windows, {{centers on a}} boy who dreams of flying through the sky while asleep in a {{hospital}} bed. The player assumes control of the sleeping boy's avatar—the projection of the boy into his dream world—and guides him through his dream {{of a small group}} of islands with a light gathering of clouds. The avatar's direction and speed are controlled with a mouse; movement is generally on a horizontal plane, but vertical flight can <b>be</b> <b>attained</b> by holding down the third button of the mouse. The player may interact with clouds only while flying horizontally.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that swaraj {{not only can}} <b>be</b> <b>attained</b> with non-violence, it can be run with non-violence. Military is unnecessary, because any aggressor can be thrown out using the method of non-violent non-co-operation. While military is unnecessary in a nation organised under swaraj principle, Gandhi added that a police force is necessary given human nature. However, the state would limit the use of weapons by the police to the minimum, aiming for their use as a restraining force.|$|E

5|$|The humanists {{believed}} {{that it is important}} to transcend to the afterlife with a perfect mind and body, which could <b>be</b> <b>attained</b> with education. The purpose of humanism was to create a universal man whose person combined intellectual and physical excellence and who was capable of functioning honorably in virtually any situation. This ideology was referred to as the uomo universale, an ancient Greco-Roman ideal. Education during the Renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history as it was thought that the classics provided moral instruction and an intensive understanding of human behavior.|$|E

5|$|Both the {{original}} 15- and 17-inch model MacBook Pros come with ExpressCard/34 slots, which replace the PC Card slots {{found in the}} PowerBook G4. All first generation 15-inch models have two USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire 400 port, while the 17-inch models have three USB 2.0 ports {{as well as one}} FireWire 400 port. When first introduced, the MacBook Pro did not come with FireWire 800 or S-Video ports, although FireWire 800 was added in the next 15-inch model revision and is present in every version of the 17-inch design. S-Video capability can <b>be</b> <b>attained</b> {{through the use of a}} DVI to S-Video adapter. External displays with up to a 2,560×1,600 pixel resolution are supported through a dual-link DVI port. All models include a built-in Gigabit Ethernet port, Bluetooth 2.0, and 802.11a/b/g. Later models include support for the draft 2.0 specification of 802.11n and Bluetooth 2.1.|$|E
5|$|In {{between these}} works he {{found time to}} write Literarum latinarum, a small {{instruction}} manual on the italic script. The italic script (or chancery cursive) reached the Low Countries from Italy {{at the beginning of}} the sixteenth century and it is recorded as a form of typescript in Leuven in 1522. It was much favoured by humanist scholars who enjoyed its elegance and clarity as well as the rapid fluency that could <b>be</b> <b>attained</b> with practice, but it was not employed for formal purposes such as globes, maps and scientific instruments (which typically used Roman capitals or gothic script). Mercator first applied the italic script to the globe of Gemma Frisius and thereafter to all his works, with ever-increasing elegance. The title page of this work is an illustration of the decorative style he developed.|$|E
5|$|In his smaller poetic works, Johnson {{relied on}} short lines and filled {{his work with}} a feeling of empathy, which {{possibly}} influenced Housman's poetic style. In London, his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the poetic form to express his political opinion and, as befits a young writer, approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. However, his second imitation, The Vanity of Human Wishes, is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics. These Christian values are not unique to the poem, but contain views expressed in most of Johnson's works. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and shows that happiness can <b>be</b> <b>attained</b> through virtuous action.|$|E

5|$|The Bahraini Economic Vision 2030 {{published}} in 2008 {{does not indicate}} how the stated goal of shifting from an economy built on oil wealth to a productive, globally competitive economy will <b>be</b> <b>attained.</b> Bahrain has already diversified its exports to some extent, out of necessity. It has the smallest hydrocarbon reserves of any Gulf state, producing 48,000 barrels per day from its one onshore field. The bulk of the country’s revenue comes from its share in the offshore field administered by Saudi Arabia. The gas reserve in Bahrain is expected to last for less than 27 years, leaving the country with few sources of capital to pursue {{the development of new}} industries. Investment in research and development remained very low in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{universe}} {{continued to}} decrease in density {{and fall in}} temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. Symmetry breaking phase transitions put the fundamental forces of physics and the parameters of elementary particles into their present form. After about 10−11 seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can <b>be</b> <b>attained</b> in particle accelerators. At about 10−6 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form baryons such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 1010 of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons.|$|E

He {{purchased}} his commission to lieutenant on 25 December 1787, in the 76th Regiment. As a junior officer he transferred to the 41st Regiment soon after to avoid duty in the East Indies, and in June 1789 transferred again, to the 12th (Prince of Wales's) Light Dragoons cavalry regiment. He obtained his commission to captain on 30 June 1791, in the 58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment, having served the regulation minimum of three years, and again to major on 30 April 1793, in the 33rd (First Yorkshire West Riding) Regiment, having served six years.

5|$|When Antoine was alive, many {{observers}} {{thought that the}} healings he obtained resulted to suggestion only, and Dr. Schuind, who wrote two articles in The Meuse (La Meuse) on the subject at the time, criticized the lack of control and vague diagnostics surrounding these healings. Sociologist Anne-Cécile Bégot considered the Antoinist healing of the first decades a form of protest against (1) the efficiency of medicine, (2) the traditional representation of disease—the real healing can <b>be</b> <b>attained</b> only through {{a new approach to}} the disease, which is never considered a particular misfortune and thus is not reduced to its biological dimension—and (3) the management of disease—sick are always responsible for their own illness. However, she concluded that this protest has evolved throughout time as (1) the disease is now represented on an endogenous etiological model, which indicates a process of individualization of the religion, and (2) the personal real-life experience is more presented as the cause of the disease than the relation to the global society.|$|E
