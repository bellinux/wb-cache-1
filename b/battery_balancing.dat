40|$|The power {{coordination}} in DC microgrids has a {{vital role}} in enhancing the performance and management of multi generation units. Renewable Energy Sources (RES) are limited to their available power with intermittent nature. Battery-based energy storage sources have limitations in the charging and discharging capabilities to avoid depleting the battery and preserve the State of Charge (SOC) within its satisfactory limits. The <b>battery</b> <b>balances</b> the power difference between RES and loads. However, in severe cases where the SOC is very low, load shedding is crucial. In this paper, a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) has been proposed to coordinate the power flow of PV unit and battery to satisfy the load by full use of the available PV power. It controls the PV’s output power and keeps the SOC and charging / discharging power of the battery within their required margins regardless of the variations in load. Furthermore, load shedding of low priority load has been implemented when the <b>battery</b> couldn’t <b>balance</b> the microgrid power flow.

40|$|Balancing {{battery cells}} {{is a key}} task for battery {{management}} systems (BMS). Imbalances of cells decrease the capacity and lifetime of the battery pack. Many balancing topologies and strategies have been proposed to balance the electric charges among cells {{and most of the}} intelligent control strategies select cells (to shuttle charges) by comparing their terminal voltages. However, the nature of battery equalization is to balance the energy stored in individual cells. The measured terminal voltage is just an external characteristic and cannot accurately reflect the state of charge (SOC) of the cell, especially in a noisy environment. Additionally, when the consistencies of cells are very poor, balancing the cells with terminal voltages will lead to serious errors. In this paper, we introduced a novel <b>battery</b> <b>balancing</b> method, in which the charge-balancing criterion was not the cell voltage, but the shuttling capacities among cells. Data stream mining (DSM) technique was used to calculate the shuttling capacities.

It is a novel concept of incorporating the functionality of a smart battery management system into the FPGA used by portable electronic devices, which provides the following advantages. (1) It lowers cost since the conventional commercial independent battery management circuit can be eliminated; (2) It offers more flexibility because FPGA based battery management algorithms can be specifically designed for different battery chemistries of different devices and can provide the flexibility of algorithms and functionalities updating as well. Smart battery management system concepts include four aspects: (1) smart charging; (2) battery balancing; (3) smart discharging; and (4) safety operating.

40|$|Lithium-based {{batteries}} are considered {{as the most}} advanced batteries technology, which can be designed for high energy or high power storage systems. However, the battery cells are never fully identical due to the fabrication process, surrounding environment factors and differences between the cells tend to grow if no measures are taken. In {{order to have a}} high performance battery system, the battery cells should be continuously balanced for maintain the variation between the cells as small as possible. Without an appropriate balancing system, the individual cell voltages will differ over time and battery system capacity will decrease quickly. These issues will limit the electric range of the electric vehicle (EV) and some cells will undergo higher stress, whereby the cycle life of these cells will be shorter. Quite a lot of cell balancing/equalization topologies have been previously proposed. These balancing topologies can be categorized into passive and active balancing. Active topologies are categorized according to the active element used for storing the energy such as capacitor and/or inductive component as well as controlling switches or converters.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops the}} theory of symmetry for constrained linear systems. We use symmetry to design model predictive controllers for constrained linear systems with reduced complexity. The dissertation {{is divided into three}} parts. In the first part we review the relevant results from model predictive control and group theory. In particular we present algorithms and data structures from computational group theory used to efficiently search groups. In the second part we develop {{the theory of}} symmetry for constrained linear systems and model predictive control problems. Symmetries of constrained linear systems are linear transformations that preserve the dynamics and constraints. A symmetry of a model predictive control problem is a symmetry of the underlying constrained system that also preserves the cost. We use a group theoretic formalism to derive properties of symmetric constrained linear systems and symmetric model predictive control problems. We prove conditions under which the model predictive controller is symmetric and present a procedure for efficiently computing the symmetries of constrained linear systems and model predictive control problems. Our method transforms the problem of finding generators for the symmetry group into a graph automorphism problem. These symmetries are used to design model predictive control algorithms with reduced complexity. We also present two novel explicit model predictive control designs. Both reduce memory requirements by discarding symmetrically redundant pieces of the control-law. The control-law in the eliminated pieces can be reconstructed online using symmetry. We show that storing the symmetries of the problem requires less memory than storing the controller pieces. In the third part of this dissertation we apply our symmetry theory to the <b>battery</b> <b>balancing</b> problem. We use symmetry to reduce the memory requirements for explicit model predictive controllers for seven battery-balancing hardware designs proposed in the literature. This application demonstrates that our symmetric controller designs can significantly reduce the memory requirements of explicit model predictive control. In particular for four out of seven of the designs in our numerical study, the number of pieces in the symmetric controller did not increase as the battery pack-size was increased...|$|E
