5000|$|In its {{founding}} year, the company launched a revolutionary engine-powered manual crop duster. Until the 1960s, the company {{concentrated on the}} manufacture of power dusters, mist blowers and other pest control machinery. The first Kyoritsu Noki <b>brushcutter</b> was introduced in 1960 and three years later, the company launched its first chainsaw, the Echo CS-80, and the first Kyoritsu Noki tool to bear the [...] "Echo" [...] brand name. In 1970, Kyoritsu claimed to have 'revolutionised' outdoor cleaning with the PB-9, a backpack power blower. The Echo brand of hand-held petrol powered tools including chainsaws, brushcutters, hedge trimmers and leaf blowers are manufactured in Yokosuka and Morioka, with other major plants in Shenzhen, China and Lake Zurich, Illinois.|$|E

The work described in this paper assesses the transmitted vibration to the human body from a hand guided power tool, means a <b>brushcutter.</b> As it is known the brushcutters induce a high level of vibrations on human operators. Depending by brushcutter’s type, exposure time and human subjectivity, we can discuss about the vibration influence on human body. Long exposure to hand-arm vibration, whole body vibration and mechanical overloading is considered a potential cause of professional diseases...|$|E

Therefore, the objective of this research was to characterize the spatial variability of the noise level generated by four agricultural machines, using geostatistics, and to verify if the values are within the limits of human comfort. The evaluated machines were: harvester, chainsaw, <b>brushcutter</b> and tractor. The data were collected {{at the height of the}} operator's ear and at different distances. Through the results, it was possible to verify that the use of geostatistics, by kriging technique, made it possible to define areas with different levels for the data collected.

In order to grow trees for high quality timber in short rotations, an intensive management, with high {{economic and environmental}} costs. The control of competing herbaceous vegetation is required for avoiding tree-herbage competition and fire risk. Silvopastoral management could allow reducing the economic costs and optimize their environmental functions. This study {{was carried out in}} various intensive 15 year old plantations of walnut located in Extremadura (Spain). A comparison of different herbaceous layer control was realized: harrow, <b>brushcutter</b> and grazing on natural grassland combined with different doses of irrigation. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the profitability of each technique and their environmental implications. The nutritional and physiological status of trees was analyzed, as well as their growth (diameter increment). In addition, the temporal dynamics of soil moisture profile, available nutrients in the soil and nitrate leaching were studied. The maximum tree growth was observed with harrowing (where the highest available N and Ca in soil were observed) and grazing treatment (where P availability in soil was increased) both combined with the highest level of irrigation (that produced an increment of P and K content in leaves). The lowest tree growth was observed with brushcutting, in spite of this treatment, as horrowing, improved the N leaf level. Moreover, brushcutting affected positively to organic matter content and produced the lowest nitrate leaching in soil (in the first 30 cm depth). Respect to nitrate leaching, the difference among treatments was not significantly below 30 cm deep which reduces environmental hazard. There was no difference in physiological status of trees and soil moisture. Therefore, silvopastoral systems can be compatible with the medium-long term hardwood timber production, with great current and future demand, developing an environmentally efficient production system...|$|E

O conhecimento da variabilidade espacial de níveis de ruído e a construção de mapas de krigagem podem auxiliar na avaliação da salubridade de ambientes ocupados por trabalhadores agrícolas. Portanto, este trabalho teve como objetivos caracterizar a variabilidade espacial do nível de ruído gerado por quatro diferentes máquinas agrícolas, utilizando a geoestatística, e verificar se os valores se encontram dentro dos limites de conforto humano. As máquinas avaliadas foram: derriçadora, motosserra, roçadora e trator. Os dados foram coletados na altura média do ouvido do operador e em diferentes distâncias. Por meio dos resultados obtidos, foi possível verificar que o uso da geoestatística, através da técnica de krigagem, possibilitou definir áreas com diferentes níveis para os dados coletados. Excetuando a derriçadora, todos os outros equipamentos apresentaram níveis de ruído acima de 85 dB(A) próximo ao operador, demandando o uso de protetores auriculares...|$|E
40|$|Phytophthora cinnamomi (Cinnamon fungus) is a {{pathogenic}} soil fungus which infects plant communities {{along the}} south-eastern coast of Australia, and the south-western corner of Western Australia. The symptoms {{of this disease}} include chlorosis, death of branches (ie. ‘dieback’), retarded growth and the eventual death of infected plants. This leads to devastating effects upon plant communities by altering both the structural and floristic characteristics of these communities. Small mammal species are dependent on specific features of their habitat such as vegetation structure and floristics. This thesis investigated alterations to the habitat of the insectivorous marsupial mouse, Antechinus stuartii, due {{to the presence of}} P. cinnamomi. The study was undertaken in an area of an open forest in the Brisbane Ranges, Victoria. Significant changes were found in both the floristic composition and structure of the vegetation at study sites infected with P, cinnamomi, compared to uninfected sites. The habitat utilization by A. stuartii of uninfected and infected vegetation was investigated using live trapping and radio-telemetric techniques. Capture rates were higher at sites uninfected by P. cinnamomi, and both male and females selected areas free from infection. Home range areas of males were significantly larger than those of females as assessed by telemetry. Both sexes spent a high proportion of time in areas dominated by Xanthorrhoea australis (Austral grass tree). There were significant relationships between the abundance of A. stuartii and the denseness of vegetation above 1 metre in height, and in particular, the proportion of cover afforded by X. australis. There {{were no significant differences in}} the cover of Eucalyptus spp. between uninfected and infected sites, but there were significantly more nest hollows in infected areas. The abundance of invertebrates was examined using pitfall traps. There were no significant differences in the abundance of the larger invertebrate taxa at infected and uninfected sites, but higher abundances of some micro-invertebrate groups in infected areas were recorded. The most likely factors considered to be influential in the habitat selection of A. stuartii were vegetation structure, and the presence of X. australis. To assess whether these factors were important the leaves of X. australis were removed with a <b>brushcutter,</b> to mimic the early effects of infection with P. cinnamomi. Animals did not respond to the alteration of vegetation structure in the short term (3 - 4 days). Longer-term experiments are required to assess the habitat utilization of A. stuartii at different periods following habitat manipulation. The implications of the presence of P. cinnamomi on the conservation of fauna are discussed. The destructive nature of the pathogen, and the slow rate of recovery from the disease, means that P. cinnamomi can be considered a threatening process to plant communities and the fauna that reside within that habitat. Future management of this disease within natural areas must therefore be cognisant of the potential of P. cinnamomi to significantly affect faunal as well as vegetative communities...|$|E
