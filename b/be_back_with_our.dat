500|$|The {{staff of}} Open Salon.com enjoyed the episode, writing [...] "While I enjoyed {{the last eight}} weeks of {{alternate}} universe hijinks, this week's episode reminded me of what I had been missing from the earlier seasons... It's nice to know we'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> good old regular Earth-1 team for the foreseeable future. Overall, this week was really well done - very effectively creepy, well directed and plotted {{with just the right}} about of gore to make you jump". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "Marionette" [...] the eleventh best episode of the series, calling it [...] "a strong, disturbing outing that was part of Fringes mid-series peak, in which the show found its best storytelling voice by crafting strange, emotionally resonant case-of-the-week plots that thematically paralleled the ongoing character arcs in ways that felt organic, not contrived." [...] In a similar 2013 list, Den of Geek ranked the episode as the third best of the entire series.|$|E

40|$|We <b>are</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> second {{article on}} clandestine drug labs. Our first {{article in the}} series {{provided}} an introduction to “clan labs, ” provided a little history and background on the epidemic, and briefly discussed the three phase approach taking the site from discovery to final clean up. After a clan lab is found, specially trained law enforcement personnel must often deal with possible booby traps while securing the site. Crime scene investigators can then move in and process the site for evidence. Following the securing and processing of the clan lab {{we move into the}} next phase, which is categorizing the chemicals and wastes and removing the gross contamination from the site. This article discusses the different methods used to make the illegal drugs at clandestine laboratories, the chemicals involved in those methods, and the hazards associated with those chemicals. In our original article we noted that clan labs can manufacture stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and narcotics. However, in 2004 the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) found that ninety eight percent (98 %) of seized laboratories were producing methamphetamine. 1 Obviously, the health and safety concerns vary based on the type of drug manufactured and the production method used, but given this fact we will focus on methamphetamine production methods...|$|R
