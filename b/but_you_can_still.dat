2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, when Island Records {{approached}} Adé about releasing his material internationally under its Mango Records imprint, the musician {{was already a}} star in his native Nigeria, with his own record label, his own nightclub to host his performances and {{a track record of}} releasing three or four albums a year. When Adé agreed, he was teamed with Martin Meissonnier, a French record producer who advised that the typical long song structures of Nigerian music would not work for Western audiences. Accordingly, Adé divided a number of his Nigerian hits for international release, a task he found unchallenging. He later explained that [...] "In Nigeria, we got used to non-stop recording, about 18 to 20 minutes of music. But over here, the music should be track-by-track for the radio and the dance floor. It's like making a dress. One by one, the different pieces are joined together, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> see the lines where they meet".|$|E

The loop tracks split {{from the main}} line just north of Orient Heights, turned east and then split with one direction heading east and the other south. Much of the rail's path was converted to roads when the line was removed, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> {{see some of the}} existing railbed that curved out into Crystal Cove at Winthrop Beach Station, and the remnants of the rail bridges as it crossed Belle Isle March to connect at Orient Heights. [...] Today, one can drive along Veteran's Road (current path of the old line) to experience the course of the commuter train as it ran parallel to Shirley Street. [...] The location of the various railway stations in Winthrop had a tremendous influence on the pattern of Winthrop's suburban growth; business and commerce grew up naturally around these stations and ultimately into what would become today's neighborhoods.|$|E

Dudley, who {{previously}} worked for Democratic Congressman Tom Daschle, [...] "agreed {{to become a}} Republican when her husband agreed to become a Methodist." [...] The Portmans attend church services at Hyde Park Community United Methodist Church. Jane Portman {{has served on the}} board of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center for 7 years and has driven a route for Meals on Wheels for 12 years. The Portmans have three children: Joseph Dudley [...] "Jed" [...] Portman, William Dudley [...] "Will" [...] Portman, and Sarah Dudley [...] "Sally" [...] Portman. Portman still owns the Golden Lamb Inn with his brother Wym Portman and sister Ginna Portman Amis. In 2004, a Dutch conglomerate purchased the Portman Equipment Company. Portman had researched the firm's local acquisitions, stating [...] "It's a concept I've heard described as 'Glocalism.' All these companies are trying to achieve economies of scale. This lets us develop a network and coverage globally. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> have the local spirit, the local name and the customer intimacy to accomplish great things." [...] A July 2012 article about Portman stated that in 40 years, his only citation has been a traffic ticket for an improper turn while driving. Portman is an avid kayaker, is fluent in Spanish, and enjoys bike rides.|$|E

I was very heavily into drinking... and leaving I was fixed on getting my family life together". They considered using a drum machine {{that was in the}} studio, but no one knew how to use it. Guitarist Huw Lloyd-Langton's wife Marion, who was press officer for Ginger Baker's manager Roy Ward's company, suggested approaching the drummer to contribute as a session player. He accepted the offer and completed his tracks in two days, surpassing expectations. Lloyd-Langton observed that [...] "he breezed through Chase" [...] straight away. I don't think Simon could have played that... Ginger fitted the band like a glove. His style was just right for it." [...] The band asked the drummer to remain with them, and despite having previously declared to the press his intentions of joining the newly reformed Atomic Rooster, he [...] "found the atmosphere during the sessions so fantastic that I immediately decided to stay with Hawkwind. For me it's not just my umpteenth group, I’m determined to give it everything I’ve got. Hawkwind always have made timeless music, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> definitely <b>still</b> hear the eighties in it." ...|$|R
50|$|The summer {{image at}} top {{right of the}} page shows the station before the big trees at the Dunlopillo factory (on the left in that image) were pruned back to the trunks. These trees had the whole trunks felled in 2012 giving an open feel to {{that side of the}} station not seen for many years. At that time, in early mornings in spring, you could watch buzzards trying to rob the rooks' nests in those trees. Since the trees were pruned (on the left in the snowy image) the buzzards have stopped coming, <b>but</b> in spring <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> watch jackdaws {{attempting}} to nest in the chimneys of the shop. The once rare and threatened red kites can now regularly be seen riding on the thermals above the station. During summer, house martins and swifts frequently scream over the station, and goldfinches and bullfinches graze on the weed-seeds between the station and Dunlopillo car-park.|$|R
2500|$|Jackman first created {{three pieces}} of music for {{directors}} Anthony and Joe Russo: a modern Captain America theme; a six-to-seven minute suite for the Winter Soldier; and a track representing Hydra. Concerning Captain America, Jackman struggled to balance having [...] "enough theme so that you’ve got something heroic to cling onto, {{but not so much}} that it’s just becoming nostalgic and irrelevant", and stated that in the third act [...] "the more melodic, the more lyrical, the more thematic element [...] to come through". The one note Feige gave Jackman on the score was asking him to embrace [...] "those moments that are emotional or historical or nostalgic", such as when the character visits his own Smithsonian exhibit. For those, Jackman took some inspiration from the works of Aaron Copland. Jackman described the Winter Soldier as [...] "a mechanized, violent, relentless, nihilistic beast that just destroys everything in its path", so approaching the character in a Wagnerian way would be [...] "inappropriate ... instead [...] to embrace it and start exploiting all these other tricks I've learned in working in the record industry and making drum and bass records." [...] In the Winter Soldier suite, [...] "the strings only show up for the last minute. It is violent—it's got screaming and banging and it's dystopian and dysfunctional. Much closer to a modern electronic thing than anything orchestral." [...] Jackman spent ten days just processing vocal recordings to give the theme a sense of [...] "tortured, time-stretched human cries of someone who has been so processed that it's become mechanized at the same time <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> hear the human in there". He also tried to give the piece an arc, where the human elements get more [...] "revealed {{toward the end of the}} film" [...] as Captain America and the audience come to learn who the Winter Soldier is and care about him. When Jackman played the suite for the directors, they loved the unique and non-film music sound, and asked that Jackman not sanitize or water it down for the film—Joe said, [...] "I really want to hear that in the movie and not just 20% of" [...] it. For Hydra, Jackman wanted to move away from the [...] "Wagnerian symphonic baddie music" [...] of the first film, and [...] "come up with a sinister tonality that didn’t feel like the muhahahaha of an arch villain, because the sinister nature of the neo-fascist within the film is modern, credible and politically contemporary." [...] Jackman also introduces a motif for the Falcon.|$|E

Asti, you are high-born and wise, one whom I love, and honour much, as does the Queen, my daughter, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> be jealous, as I have noted long. Asti, be not deceived, it was jealousy of Merytra that whispered in your ears, not the spirit of the divine Ahura.

6000|$|... "Who {{talked of}} such folly?" [...] asked MacIan disdainfully. [...] "Do you {{suppose that the}} Catholic Church ever held that Christians were the only good men? Why, the Catholics of the Catholic Middle Ages talked about the virtues of all the virtuous Pagans until {{humanity}} was sick of the subject. No, {{if you really want}} to know what we mean when we say that Christianity has a special power of virtue, I will tell you. The Church is the only thing on earth that can perpetuate a type of virtue and make it something more than a fashion. The thing is so plain and historical that I hardly think you will ever deny it. You cannot deny that it is perfectly possible that tomorrow morning, in Ireland or in Italy, there might appear a man not only as good but good in exactly the same way as St. Francis of Assisi. Very well, now take the other types of human virtue; many of them splendid. The English gentleman of Elizabeth was chivalrous and idealistic. <b>But</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> stand <b>still</b> here in this meadow and be an English gentleman of Elizabeth? The austere republican of the eighteenth century, with his stern patriotism and his simple life, was a fine fellow. <b>But</b> have <b>you</b> ever seen him? have you ever seen an austere republican? Only a hundred years have passed and that volcano of revolutionary truth and valour is as cold as the mountains of the moon. And so it is and so it will be with the ethics which are buzzing down Fleet Street at this instant as I speak. What phrase would inspire the London clerk or workman just now? Perhaps that he is a son of the British Empire on which the sun never sets; perhaps that he is a prop of his Trades Union, or a class-conscious proletarian something or other; perhaps merely that he is a gentleman when he obviously is not. Those names and notions are all honourable; but how long will they last? Empires break; industrial conditions change; the suburbs will not last for ever. What will remain? I will tell you. The Catholic Saint will remain." ...|$|R
40|$|This month {{began with}} the {{countdown}} clocks ticking away the time until {{the start of the}} 2010 Shanghai Expo hitting the one-year-to-go point, and the weeks that have followed have seen the international press pay a good deal of attention to this upcoming event, which had gotten relatively little media coverage in the Western media. There have been a flurry of op-eds (including this one by China Beat‘s Jeff Wasserstrom), reports {{on the question of whether}} the U. S. will have a national pavilion (such as this one by Shanghai Scrap‘s Adam Minter), and feature stories on the city of Shanghai that highlight the build-up to the Expo (such asthis one in the Washington Post). In addition, while Shanghai-based publications had long been trumpeting its importance, the focus on it in major Chinese national press organs also increased last month, with Beijing Review, for example, devoting several articles to it in a recent Shanghai-themed issue (particularly noteworthy is this one by Fudan University historian Li Tiangang). In light of this, we thought this was a good time to ask Gina Anne Russo, a Fulbright scholar based in the city that is gearing up for the Expo, and someone whose “Gina in Shanghai” blog had caught our attention, to fill our readers in on the publicity campaign under way to whip up enthusiasm for an event that has been called an “Economic Olympics” and also “China’s First World’s Fair” and will run from May 1 -October 31 of 2010. We’ll be running her response in two parts, which focus on different aspects of the “Better City, Better Life” slogan that is being used to promote the extravaganza: Shanghai has had a history of personality cults that permeate the visual landscape of the city. However, today, Mao’s presence, ubiquitous only 40 years ago, has all <b>but</b> faded —though <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> find some reminders that he was once omnipresent, such as the big statue of the Chairman that continues to stand on the East China Normal University and the kitsch items for sale at Shanghai souvenir stalls (though these are aimed largely at foreigners). Even the pervasive symbols of American consumerism Colonel Sanders’ and Ronald McDonald’s are not as common as they once were—though each of them have some statues as well, standing (the Colonel) or sitting (the clown) near the entrances to venues selling buckets of chicken and Big Macs, respectively. Today, the latest personality to overcome Shanghai’s visual landscape is quite different, a symbol of neither Communist Revolution nor capitalist consumer culture. His name is Haibao...|$|R
40|$|Can Landscape {{be created}} like a caricature? How can the key {{characteristics}} of a site be celebrated in different ways through design? Can potential design possibilities be generated through celebrating the key {{characteristics of a}} site&# 039;s contexts? My research started {{with the idea of}} &# 039;Identity&# 039;, as the existing Central Plaza copies the physical form of an adjacent park (People&# 039;s Park) in a simplistic way without considering its own unique key contexts, and I think every location and context is different. Careful consideration of both physical and cultural contexts is what a landscape architect undertakes as an essential part of developing a design, however, how can a stronger or more interesting idea be created for a specific site? One day, the idea of CARICATURE suddenly occurred to me when I was having a shower. What I find inspirational about caricature is the aspect of &# 039;Celebration&# 039; which it encourages. Just as a site has unique characteristics and each of them can be celebrated differently, each caricature celebrates the particular physical and emotional characteristics of a single, unique original identity. Each successful caricature can be related clearly to the key characteristics of its own identity, so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> recognize the person and you are encouraged to have fun as well in that game of recognition. By &# 039;Celebration&# 039; I mean the carefully chosen, positive exaggeration, intensification and emphasis of key characteristics which reveal how good, how important, or how unique the site is. &# 039;Celebration&# 039; is an act of revealing and sharing the positive potential qualities of a site. In terms of landscape design, what I sought to do is to reinforce the key qualities of my site through design or designs which would emphasize. If landscape is thought about and designed like caricatures are created, interesting or potential possibilities could be generated for design responses. Before celebrating, it is necessary {{to make sure that the}} site contexts have been fully analyzed and understood. After that, we can celebrate particular qualities through design. I have produced three different designs based on the conceptual idea of &# 039;caricature&# 039;. They are called Topopark, Occupark and Tocopark. Topopark started from a focus on one of the physical context of the site - that is, its topography. It celebrates the topographic context as well as the relationship of the activities between and beneath Central Plaza and People&# 039;s Park. Occupark focuses on the celebration of the various types of occupation activities which take place. Tocopark started around the possibility of generating the plaza&# 039;s organisation from the organization of circulation systems and combines to celebrate both topography and active occupation. Although Tocopark is more intensive than Topopark and Occupark in terms of the idea of celebration, all three have different strengthens and weaknesses. Like the example of the caricatures of Ronaldinho, the same identity is celebrated in different ways, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>can</b> recognize him in each one and enjoy them equally as well, because all of them relate to t he key characteristics of his appearance and personality...|$|R
6000|$|... 123. The actual {{quantity}} of money which it coins, {{in relation to}} its real property, is therefore only of consequence for convenience of exchange; but the proportion in which this quantity of money is divided among individuals expresses their various rights to greater or less proportions of the national property, and must not, therefore, be tampered with. The government may at any time, with perfect justice, double its issue of coinage, if it gives every man who has ten pounds in his pocket another ten pounds, and every man who had ten pence another ten pence; for it thus does not make any of them richer; it merely divides their counters for them into twice the number. But if it gives the newly-issued coins to other people, or keeps them itself, it simply robs the former holders to precisely that extent. This most important function of money, as a title-deed, on the non-violation of which all national soundness of commerce and peace of life depend, has been never rightly distinguished by economists from the quite unimportant function of money {{as a means of}} exchange.
