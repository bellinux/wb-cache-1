50|$|Nacre is {{secreted}} by the {{epithelial cells}} of the mantle tissue of various molluscs. The nacre is continuously deposited onto the inner surface of the shell, the iridescent nacreous layer, commonly known as mother of pearl. The layers of nacre smooth the shell surface and help defend the soft tissues against parasites and damaging debris by entombing them in successive layers of nacre, forming either a <b>blister</b> <b>pearl</b> attached to {{the interior of the}} shell, or a free pearl within the mantle tissues. The process is called encystation and it continues as long as the mollusc lives.|$|E
50|$|Pearls {{are only}} {{occasionally}} found. They are yellow and small. The nacre is thin and the shells are small, making them of little commercial value. However, before {{the introduction of}} the Mississippi shell, their ideal shape for buttons made “Shark Bay” shells critical to the Mother of Pearl Industry in the 19th century. Today, the species is used for culturing <b>blister</b> <b>pearls</b> (Mabe pearls).|$|R
40|$|On December 23 and 24, 2004, a {{biological}} survey of bivalve-inhabiting hydrozoans and pearls {{was conducted on}} 398 specimens of five bivalve species (158 specimens of Perna viridis, 148 0 f Saccostrea forskali, 81 Meretrix meretrix, 39 M. lyrata and 72 Tegillarca granosa), all obtained in a field and a seafood market in the eastern coasts of the Gulf of Thailand. High number of pearls (31 and 26) embedded in the mantle were detected in two specimens of Perna viridis. Furthermore, many <b>blister</b> <b>pearls</b> (attached pearl) were produced on the inner surface of these shells. However, bivalve-inhabiting hydroids were not yet found in the mantle cavity of any bivalve species examined, though other commensal animals such as copepods and turbellanans were found...|$|R
40|$|When Kokichi Mikimoto {{took the}} small {{step forward in}} 1893 by {{producing}} a few <b>blister</b> <b>pearls</b> in the Japanese pearl oyster Pinctada martensii (= P. fucata) at the coastal village of Jinmiyonmura on Ago Bay, a new industry of pearl culture was bom. As he was building up a small-scale industry, a few marine scientists and technicians got themselves interested in it and, in 1907, Tokichi Nishikawa produced the first spherical cultured pearl in the oyster. Subsequently, the credibility of cultured pearl as jewel {{was established in the}} 1920 s and was followed by a boom of pearl culture industry with a master touch of Mikimoto and several other industrialists who joined the bandwagon. After World War 11, pearl culture industry was established in Australia, Philippines, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, all with Japanese collaboration...|$|R
50|$|The Arco Valley Pearl {{is a white}} 575 carat g natural <b>blister</b> baroque <b>pearl</b> {{with pink}} and yellow overtones. It {{measures}} 79 x 41 x 34 mm. It is the largest natural pearl outside a museum and the second biggest ever. Mongolian emperor Khubilai Khan reportedly gave it to Marco Polo.|$|R
40|$|Fossil <b>blister</b> <b>pearls</b> {{attached}} to the shells of an Anodonta mollusk from China, early Early Pleistocene, are reported {{here for the first}} time. The pearls were investigated in detail using a variety of methods. Micro-CT scanning of the fossil pearls was carried out to discover the inner structure and the pearl nucleus. Using CTAn software, changes in the gray levels of the biggest pearl, which reflect the changing density of the material, were investigated. The results provide us with some clues on how these pearls were formed. Sand grains, shell debris or material with a similar density could have stimulated the development of these pearls. X-ray diffraction analysis of one fossil pearl and the shell to which it was attached reveals that only aragonite exists in both samples. The internal structures of our fossil shells and pearls were investigated using a Scanning Electron Microscope. These investigations throw some light on pearl development in the past...|$|R
50|$|A few species produce pearls {{that can}} be of {{interest}} as gemstones. These species include the bailer shell Melo, the giant clam Tridacna, various scallop species, Pen shells Pinna, and the Haliotis iris species of abalone. Pearls of abalone, or pāua, are mabe <b>pearls,</b> or <b>blister</b> <b>pearls,</b> unique to New Zealand waters and are {{commonly referred to as}} 'blue pearls'. They are admired for their incredible luster and naturally bright vibrant colors that are often compared to opal. Another example is the conch pearl (sometimes referred to simply as the 'pink pearl'), which is found very rarely growing between the mantle and the shell of the queen conch or pink conch, Strombus gigas, a large sea snail or marine gastropod from the Caribbean Sea. These pearls, which are often pink in color, are a by-product of the conch fishing industry, and the best of them display a shimmering optical effect related to chatoyance known as 'flame structure'.|$|R
