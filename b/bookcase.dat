5|$|During the 60 {{years of}} {{occupancy}} by the Israeli army, the base was served by an army synagogue {{in one of}} the halls of the main building, including a Torah ark, <b>bookcase,</b> and a balcony door set with 12 stained-glass windows depicting the Twelve Tribes of Israel.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} it was {{believed}} that Alkan met his death when a <b>bookcase</b> toppled over and fell on him as he reached for a volume of the Talmud from a high shelf. This tale, which was circulated by the pianist Isidor Philipp, is dismissed by Hugh Macdonald, who reports the discovery of a contemporary letter by one of his pupils explaining that Alkan had been found prostrate in his kitchen, under a porte-parapluie (a heavy coat/umbrella rack), after his concierge heard his moaning. He had possibly fainted, bringing it down on himself while grabbing out for support. He was reportedly carried to his bedroom and died later that evening. The story of the <b>bookcase</b> may have its roots in a legend told of Aryeh Leib ben Asher, rabbi of Metz, the town from which Alkan's family originated.|$|E
50|$|Safe rooms can {{be hidden}} behind many {{household}} features, such as mirrors, wardrobes, <b>bookcases,</b> sliding <b>bookcases,</b> and even fireplaces.|$|R
50|$|Sliding <b>bookcases</b> {{have been}} a part of many fictional works. Libraries in fiction have {{sometimes}} been characterized as existent in secret rooms, hidden by sliding <b>bookcases.</b>|$|R
40|$|Light is {{streaming}} {{in through the}} large windows. Large circular light fixtures hang down form the stenciled ceiling. <b>Bookcases</b> line the walls on both levels. There is a bust {{on top of one}} of the upper level <b>bookcases.</b> Long wooden tables are in front of the <b>bookcases.</b> Librarians are working at the reference desk. Stone stairs {{at the end of the}} room lead to the second floor...|$|R
5|$|Many of {{the early}} pieces of furniture, such as the Narcissus Washstand, the Zodiac Settle and the Great <b>Bookcase,</b> were {{originally}} made for Burges's office at Buckingham Street and were later moved to the Tower House. The Great <b>Bookcase</b> was also part of Burges's contribution to the Medieval Court at the 1862 International Exhibition. Later pieces, such as the Crocker Dressing Table and the Golden Bed, and its accompanying Vita Nuova Washstand, were made specifically for the house. John Betjeman located the Narcissus Washstand in a junk shop in Lincoln {{and gave it to}} Evelyn Waugh, a fellow enthusiast for Victorian art and architecture, who featured it in his 1957 novel, The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold. Betjeman later gave Waugh both the Zodiac Settle and the Philosophy Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his death}} (which {{according}} to persistent but unfounded legend {{was caused by}} a falling <b>bookcase)</b> Alkan's music became neglected, supported by only a few musicians including Ferruccio Busoni, Egon Petri and Kaikhosru Sorabji. From the late 1960s onwards, led by Raymond Lewenthal and Ronald Smith, many pianists have recorded his music and brought it back into the repertoire.|$|E
5|$|The house retains {{most of its}} {{internal}} structural decoration, {{but much of the}} furniture, fittings and contents that Burges designed has been dispersed. Many items, including the Great <b>Bookcase,</b> the Zodiac settle, the Golden Bed and the Red Bed, are now in institutions such as The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, while others are in private collections.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, small {{enclosed}} <b>bookcases,</b> {{usually in}} front of residences, have become a common sight in many cities. Some of these are officially registered with the Little Free Library network. In Europe many public <b>bookcases</b> are registered via the Open Book Case project. The Open source /crowdsourcing mapping project OpenStreetMap has a designated tag for registering the location types and more of public <b>bookcases.</b>|$|R
50|$|Open <b>bookcases</b> are {{financed by}} {{a wide range of}} organisations (individuals, foundations, Lions Clubs, civic associations, and so on). Visitors to the <b>bookcases</b> decide which books to deposit and borrow, and whether to return or {{exchange}} borrowed books for others.|$|R

5|$|Adults have {{extremely}} variable lifespans, from {{weeks to}} years, {{depending on the}} species. Some wood-boring beetles can have extremely long life-cycles. It is believed that when furniture or house timbers are infested by beetle larvae, the timber already contained the larvae {{when it was first}} sawn up. A birch <b>bookcase</b> 40 years old released adult Eburia quadrigeminata (Cerambycidae), while Buprestis aurulenta and other Buprestidae have been documented as emerging as much as 51 years after manufacture of wooden items.|$|E
5|$|No more volumes were {{purchased}} {{until the end}} of 1820, when the society acquired the works of Livy, Tacitus, and John Marshall's Life of Washington. Three months later, the society purchased a <b>bookcase</b> for its growing collection. In April 1821, the society further expanded its library with the acquisitions of Nathaniel Hooke's Roman History, from the Building of Rome to the Ruin of the Commonwealth, the works of Herodotus, Travels in Greece, Modern Europe, David Ramsay's History of the United States, and the works of Benjamin Franklin.|$|E
5|$|Revolving bookcase: Revolving bookcases, {{known as}} zhuanluntang, have been {{documented}} in ancient China, and its invention is credited to Fu Xi in 544. Descriptions of revolving bookcases {{have been found in}} 8th- and 9th-century Chinese texts. Revolving bookcases were popularized in Buddhist monasteries during the Song Dynasty under the reign of Emperor Taizu, who ordered the mass printing of the Buddhist Tripiá¹­aka scriptures. An illustration of a revolving <b>bookcase</b> is depicted in Li Jie's architectural treatise the Yingzao Fashi.|$|E

5000|$|Closely {{allied with}} the BookCrossing concept, the {{original}} public <b>bookcases</b> were conceived as artistic acts. Very early examples are the creations of performance artist duo Clegg & Guttmann in 1991. Collections of <b>bookcases</b> were conceived as [...] "free open-air libraries" [...] in Darmstadt and Hannover in the late 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Both Chippendale and Sheraton made or {{designed}} many <b>bookcases,</b> mostly glazed {{with little}} lozenges encased in fretwork frames, often of great charm and elegance. In {{the eyes of}} some, the grace of some of Sheraton's satinwood <b>bookcases</b> has rarely been equalled. The French cabinetmakers of the same period were also highly successful with small ornamental cases. Mahogany, rosewood satinwood and even choicer exotic timbers were used; they were often inlaid with marquetry and mounted with chased and gilded bronze. Dwarf <b>bookcases</b> were frequently finished with a slab of choice marble at the top.|$|R
5|$|Since {{the house}} passed to the National Trust in 1972, major works of {{restoration}} and re-creation have been undertaken {{and a number of}} pieces of Burges furniture, mostly not original to the house, are displayed. These include a <b>bookcase</b> from Buckingham Street and a chimney piece from the Hall at Worcester College, Oxford, where, in the 1960s, some decorative works by Burges were removed, although his redecoration of the college Chapel remains. The aim is, as far as possible, to reinstate the work of Burges and Crace.|$|E
5|$|The bookwheel (also written book {{wheel and}} {{sometimes}} called a reading wheel) {{is a type}} of rotating <b>bookcase</b> designed to allow one person to read a variety of heavy books in one location with ease. The books are rotated vertically similar to the motion of a water wheel, as opposed to rotating on a flat table surface. The design for the bookwheel originally appeared in a 16th-century illustration by Agostino Ramelli, at a time when large books posed practical problems for readers. Ramelli's design influenced other engineers and, though now obsolete, inspires modern artists and historians.|$|E
5|$|Miles, Richard, and Ben {{go back to}} {{the barracks}} to get some C4 that Ben {{secretly}} kept in his closet behind the <b>bookcase.</b> When they get there Miles hears the screams of Ben's daughter Alex, buried there. They get the C4 but when they come out they are confronted by Widmore and his geologist Zoe. Widmore says he needs a hiding place because the monster was coming. Ben reluctantly says he can hide in his secret room. When The Man in Black comes Richard says he can talk to it, claiming all he wants is for Richard to join him. Ben goes with him but Miles; saying he is sticking to surviving, decides to leave them and run back into the jungle.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bookcase's</b> first {{inclusion}} in the IKEA Catalogue was in the 1980 edition. Initially the <b>bookcases</b> were 90cm wide, but this was revised to 80cm in 1988 following complaints from customers that the shelves bent {{under the weight of}} the books and the item didn't fit on IKEA transport pallets.|$|R

5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{persistent}} claims of betrayal by an informant, {{the source of the}} information that led the authorities to raid the Achterhuis has never been identified. Night watchman Martin Sleegers and an unidentified police officer investigated a burglary at the premises in April 1944 and came across the <b>bookcase</b> concealing the secret door. Tonny Ahlers, a member of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB), was suspected of being the informant by Carol Ann Lee, biographer of Otto Frank. Another suspect is stockroom manager Willem van Maaren. The Annex occupants did not trust him, as he seemed inquisitive regarding people entering the stockroom after hours. He once unexpectedly asked the employees whether there had previously been a Mr. Frank at the office. Lena Hartog was suspected of being the informant by Anne Frank's biographer Melissa MÃ¼ller. Several of these suspects knew one another and might have worked in collaboration. While virtually everyone connected with the betrayal was interrogated after the war, no one was definitively identified as being the informant.|$|E
5|$|Born in Frankfurt, Germany, {{she lived}} {{most of her}} life in or near Amsterdam, Netherlands, having moved there with her family at the age of four and {{one-half}} when the Nazis gained control over Germany. Born a German national, Frank lost her citizenship in 1941 and thus became stateless. By May 1940, the Franks were trapped in Amsterdam by the German occupation of the Netherlands. As persecutions of the Jewish population increased in July 1942, the family went into hiding in some concealed rooms behind a <b>bookcase</b> in the building where Anne's father worked. From then until the family's arrest by the Gestapo in August 1944, Anne kept a diary she had received as a birthday present, and wrote in it regularly. Following their arrest, the Franks were transported to concentration camps. In October or November 1944, Anne and her sister, Margot, were transferred from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where they died (probably of typhus) a few months later. They were originally estimated by the Red Cross to have died in March, with Dutch authorities setting 31 March as their official date of death, but research by the Anne Frank House in 2015 suggests they more likely died in February.|$|E
5|$|After {{trekking}} {{across the}} desert and nearly dying of dehydration, Tintin and Haddock are rescued and taken to a French outpost, where they hear on the radio the storm sunk the Karaboudjan. They travel to a Moroccan port, {{and along the way}} are attacked by Tuareg tribesmen, defending themselves with French MAS-36 rifles. At the port, members of his old crew kidnap the Captain after he recognises their disguised Karaboudjan. Tintin meets Thomson and Thompson who got his message, and they learn that the wealthy merchant Omar ben Salaad sold the crab tins; Tintin tells Thomson and Thompson to discreetly investigate. Tintin tracks down the gang and saves the Captain, but they both become intoxicated by the fumes from wine barrels breached in a shootout with the villains. Haddock chases a gang-member from the cellar to an entrance behind a <b>bookcase</b> in Salaad's house. Upon sobering up, Tintin discovers a necklace of a crab with golden claws on the now-subdued owner of the wine cellar, Omar ben Salaad, and realizes that he {{is the leader of the}} drug cartel. Allan steals a boat and tries escaping, but Tintin captures him. The police arrest the gang and free the Japanese man, who introduces himself as Bunji Kuraki, a police detective who was trying to warn Tintin of the group he was up against. He had been investigating the sailor on Haddock's crew who drowned; the sailor was on the verge of bringing him opium before he was eliminated. Turning on the radio, Tintin learns that, thanks to him, the entire organisation of the Crab with the Golden Claws is behind bars.|$|E
