Randy Scheunemann, {{a board member of}} the Project for the New American Century, was hired in January 2007 as McCain's foreign-policy aide.

Douglas Holtz-Eakin was a senior policy adviser, Nicolas Muzin was medical advisor and Nicolle Wallace was senior adviser on message.|$|E
25|$|Irving Kristol and Leo Strauss were {{founders of}} the movement. The {{magazines}} Commentary and Public Interest were their key outlets, as well as op-ed articles for major newspapers and position papers for think tanks. Activists around Democratic senator Henry Jackson became deeply involved as well. Prominent spokesmen include Gertrude Himmelfarb, <b>Bill</b> <b>Kristol,</b> Paul Wolfowitz, Lewis Libby, Norman Podhoretz, Richard Pipes, David Horowitz, Charles Krauthammer, Richard Perle, Robert Kagan, Elliott Abrams and Ben Wattenberg. Meanwhile, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was highly sympathetic but remained a Democrat. Some of Strauss' influential neoconservative disciples included Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, Paul Wolfowitz (who became Deputy Secretary of Defense), Alan Keyes (who became Assistant Secretary of State), William Bennett (who became Secretary of Education), Weekly Standard editor William Kristol, political philosopher Allan Bloom, writer John Podhoretz, college president John Agresto, political scientist Harry V. Jaffa and novelist Saul Bellow.|$|E
25|$|After McCain {{announced}} Palin as {{his running}} mate, Newsweek and Time put Palin on their magazine covers, {{as some of the}} media alleged that McCain's campaign was restricting press access to Palin by allowing only three one-on-one interviews and no press conferences with her. Among the reasons that the news organizations criticized the restrictions was Palin's first major interview, with Charles Gibson of ABC News, met with mixed reviews. Her interview five days later with Fox News's Sean Hannity focuses on many of the same questions from Gibson's interview. However, Palin's performance in her third interview, with Katie Couric of CBS News, was widely criticized. Palin's responses to several of Couric's questions were considered embarrassing, most notably failing to name any newspapers she read. The fallout from the interview prompted a decline in her poll numbers, concern among Republicans that she was becoming a political liability, and calls from some conservative commentators for Palin to resign from the Presidential ticket. Other conservatives remain ardent in their support for Palin, accusing the columnists of elitism. Following this interview, some Republicans, including Mitt Romney and <b>Bill</b> <b>Kristol,</b> questioned the McCain campaign's strategy of sheltering Palin from unscripted encounters with the press.|$|E
2500|$|McCaughey's [...] "No Exit" [...] {{article was}} quickly used by {{conservative}} officials and commentators seeking {{to discredit the}} Clinton plan. Senator Bob Dole, in the Republican Party response to the President's State of the Union, used some of McCaughey's arguments of fewer choices, lower quality, and more government control. <b>Bill</b> <b>Kristol's</b> Project for the Republican Future quickly launched television advertisements featuring quotes from McCaughey's two Wall Street Journal op-ed columns and her The New Republic article. Newsweek columnist George Will used McCaughey's writings {{as a basis for}} predicting that the Clinton health plan would kill patients and make it illegal for patients to pay doctors directly for care, with 15-year jail terms for patients who tried to do so.|$|R
2500|$|Conservative New York Times {{columnist}} <b>Bill</b> <b>Kristol</b> rejected Obama's {{call for}} a discussion of race in America, saying: [...] "The last thing we need now is a heated national conversation about race. ... 'National conversations' tend to be pointless and result-less." [...] In contrast, liberal columnist Frank Rich said that he shared [...] "the general view that Mr. Obama's speech is the most remarkable utterance on the subject by a public figure in modern memory." ...|$|E
2500|$|Longstanding {{supporters}} {{of the war and}} President Bush were harshly critical of the Iraq Study Group report. The cover of the December 7 New York Post depicts the heads of James Baker and Lee Hamilton superimposed onto the bodies of monkeys, with the headline [...] "Surrender Monkeys: Iraq panel urges U.S. to give up." [...] Neoconservative media pundit <b>Bill</b> <b>Kristol</b> called the report [...] "an evasion" [...] and [...] "not a serious document". Rush Limbaugh asserted that the members of the [...] "Iraq Surrender Group" [...] are [...] "doing everything they can to unite the American people" [...] in [...] "defeat" [...] and [...] "surrender"; and Glenn Beck called the report [...] "Operation White Flag." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon Lieberman's announcement, {{independent}} polls {{continued to}} show him favored to win a plurality or outright majority {{of the vote in}} a three-way general election (see below). The petition issue led to charges against the Lieberman campaign of political opportunism and lack of respect for the political process. Lieberman received strong support from many prominent conservative pundits and publications. [...] "is most vocal support came from places like The Weekly Standard, National Review, and Commentary Magazine; Sean Hannity, <b>Bill</b> <b>Kristol</b> and right-wing radio hosts cheered for his victory." [...] Thus, [...] "Lieberman was able to run in the general election as the de facto Republican candidate — every major Republican office-holder in the state endorsed him — and to supplement that GOP base with strong support from independents." ...|$|E
2500|$|For example, Conservative GOP {{columnist}} <b>Bill</b> <b>Kristol</b> advocated several free-market reforms {{instead of}} the Clinton plan during the 1993–1994 period. Investigative reporter and columnist John Stossel has remarked that [...] "Insurance invites waste. That's a reason health care costs so much, and is often so consumer-unfriendly. In the few areas where there are free markets in health care – such as cosmetic medicine and Lasik eye surgery – customer service is great, and prices continue to drop." [...] Republican Senator and medical doctor Tom Coburn has stated that the healthcare system in Switzerland {{should serve as a}} model for U.S. reform. He wrote for New York Sun that reform should involve a market-based method transferring health care tax benefits to individuals rather than employers as well as giving individuals extra tax credits to afford more coverage.|$|E
2500|$|As a U.S. Congressman, Price voted {{multiple}} times {{to repeal the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as well as portions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Price introduced his first post-Obamacare bill as early as 2009, thereafter reintroducing updated versions in every Congress since that point. In May 2015, as House Budget Committee chairman, Price released health care legislation which was described by <b>Bill</b> <b>Kristol</b> of the National Review as [...] "the strongest Obamacare alternative offered in Congress to date." [...] Greg Sargent of the Washington Post wrote of the bill, [...] "it's {{good to have a}} fleshed out plan, because it helps clarify the differences between the parties on health reform." [...] Sargent also wrote that [...] "GOP reforms would likely translate into lower-quality plans and a coverage expansion that would benefit fewer people. But that would be the trade-off Republicans would make to achieve their goal of less government spending and interference in the market than that which occurs under Obamacare." [...] In 2017, after Price was nominated to be Secretary of Health and Human Services, NPR wrote that Price's 2015 bill would be seen as [...] "one of the main paths forward to repeal portions of the ACA." ...|$|E

50|$|Several {{conservative}} commentators met Palin in {{the summer}} of 2007.

5000|$|CBS News {{producers}} segmented key {{moments from}} the interviews {{over the course}} of several days and on multiple formats, including The Early Show, the Evening News, and the Internet.

5000|$|The slogan {{has been}} criticized by some for {{carrying}} comparisons to the America First Committee; however, Trump denied being an isolationist, and said, [...] "I like the expression." [...] A number of scholars (such as Deborah Dash Moore), commentators (such as <b>Bill</b> <b>Kristol)</b> and Jewish organizations (such as the Anti-Defamation League and the Jewish Council for Public Affairs) criticized Trump's use of the slogan because of its historical association with nativism and antisemitism.|$|E
