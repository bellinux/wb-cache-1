25|$|The {{movement}} {{of crude oil}} by rail is far from new, but {{it is now a}} rapidly growing market for North American railroads. The growth is driven by several factors. One is that the transmission pipelines from Alberta are operating at or near capacity and companies who cannot get pipeline space have to move oil by rail instead. Another is that many refineries on the east, west, and Gulf coasts of North America are under-served by pipelines since they assumed that they would obtain their oil by ocean tanker. Producers of new oil in Alberta, North Dakota, and West Texas are now shipping oil by rail to coastal refiners who are having difficulty obtaining international oil at prices competitive with those in the interior of North America. In addition, crude bitumen can be loaded directly into tank cars equipped with steam heating coils, avoiding the need for blending it with expensive condensate in order to ship it to market. Tank cars can also be built to transport condensate on the <b>back-haul</b> from refineries to the oil sands to make additional revenue rather than returning empty.|$|E

5000|$|Contention ratios are {{essentially}} just planning rules {{which are used}} to design a network offering (typically) an Internet service. The perception {{of the quality of}} that service will depend on the actual usage of the users of the service. This is partly why rules such as 20:1 for business and 50:1 for residential users came about. The actual usage demands of users have changed over the years and for evening/weekend traffic residential users can be demanding a lot of bandwidth making 50:1 contention ratios inappropriate. Contention ratios also only really make sense if dealing with relatively consistent speeds. The fact that a single <b>back-haul</b> in the UK could have users at 500 kbit/s and users at 100 Mbit/s makes normal contention ratio planning a thing of the past.

One promising solution to improve the capacity for these vehicular users is to employ moving relays or car base stations. The system forms cell inside the vehicle and then uses rooftop antenna for <b>back-hauling</b> to overcome the vehicular penetration loss. In this paper, we develop a model for aggregate interference distribution generated from moving/parked cars to indoor users in order to study whether indoor femto-cells can coexist on the same spectrum with vehicular communications. Since spectrum authorization for vehicular communications is open at moment, we consider two spectrum sharing scenarios (i) communication from mounted antennas {{on the roof of the}} vehicles to the infrastructure network utilizes same spectrum with indoor femto-cells (ii) in-vehicle communication utilizes same spectrum with indoor femto-cells while vehicular to infrastructure (V 2 I) communication is allocated at different spectrum. Based on our findings we suggest that V 2 I and indoor femto-cells should be allocated at different spectrum. The reason being that mounted roof-top antennas facing the indoor cells generate unacceptable interference levels. On the other hand, in-vehicle communication and indoor cells can share the spectrum thanks to the vehicle body isolation and the lower transmit power levels that can be used inside the vehicle.

40|$|The drastic {{increase}} of traffic in cellular networks {{due to the}} introduction of mo- bile broadband technologies such as HSPA and LTE has created a need to improve the data throughput in the <b>back-hauling</b> networks and thus over the microwave links. The scarcity and the high cost of spectrum have influenced telecommunication fraternity to come up with spectrally efficient communication systems. The techniques like line-of- sight MIMO and Dual Polarization-multiplexing have enabled the increase in spectral ef- ficiency. Though the above techniques have improved the spectral efficiency significantly, further improvements have to be considered. Dual polarization-multiplexing and spatially-separated line-of-sight MIMO techniques have given rise to parallel streams for communication. The existing systems modulate and demodulate these parallel streams independently. In this thesis, the idea of using the parallel streams together for modulation and detection (joint modulation and detection) is considered. This allows the signal space to move from two to higher dimensions. In this thesis the modulation formats in four-dimensional (4 -D) space are examined. Further, the same idea has been extended to eight dimensions. The performance of modulation formats in four and eight dimensions are compared with the standard QAM constellations. The introduced modulation formats are shown to be power and spectrally efficient. The performance of the modulation formats is studied for AWGN and partially coherent AWGN channel models and capacity curves are plotted. Finally, we have discussed low complexity detectors for the joint modulations which make the modulation formats practically feasible...|$|R

These factors, specially the capacity of the <b>back-haul</b> link, determine the level of cooperation and the transmission strategy in multi-cell systems[8 – 10]. Cooperative beamforming, which requires the exchange of CSI only, improves the sum rate with a reasonable <b>back-haul</b> load. In fact, the <b>back-haul</b> load for exchanging CSI is very small as compared to exchanging user data[9]. A comparison of cooperative (altruistic) and competitive (egoistic) beamforming strategies and the achievable rate regions in multiple-input single-output interference channel (MISO-IC) are studied in[11, 12]. These beamforming strategies are distributed, non-iterative, and satisfy per base station power constraint. However, it is assumed that there is perfect CSI at the transmitter. In the presence of only statistical CSI, the achievable rate regions for a two-user MISO-IC are studied in[13].|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the determinants of maritime and overland transport costs and the role they play in deterring trade across countries. We estimate a transport cost function using data on maritime and overland transport of the ceramic sector (tiles) obtained from interviews held with Spanish logistics operators. We also study the relationship between transport costs and trade and estimate an import demand model for ceramic products. Additionally, we present a discussion on the sensitivity of trade flows and transportation costs {{to the existence of}} <b>back-hauling,</b> special conditions for transport and number of reloads. 1 The study of modal transport (overland versus maritime) and its differential characteristics are of relevant interest for maritime economists and should be taken into account in economic policy-making. Furthermore, the proven impact of infrastructure on transport costs and trade points towards the importance of investing in new port infrastructures as a way of fostering trade and income. Our results from the transport cost estimation show that higher distance and poor partner infrastructure lead to a notable increase in transport costs. Inclusion of infrastructure measures improves the fit of the regression, thus corroborating the importance of infrastructure in determining transport costs. The distance coefficient remains significant and with similar magnitude when we add infrastructure variables. Our results from the trade equation estimation show that importer income, as expected, has a positive influence in bilateral trade flows. Higher transport costs significantly deter trade, and distance {{does not appear to be}} a good proxy for transport costs in the ceramics sector.

40|$|Approximately 60 {{million cubic}} meters of round wood are transported every year with trucks in Sweden and stand for 15 % of all truck {{transportation}} in the country. The big amount that is transported results in many haulage companies works {{in different parts of}} the country with different conditions to get a good flow on their transports. Today the transport pricing is very general and the payment consists of the unit round wood they are transporting and the distance of the transport. The purpose of this study were, from the freighter and the haulage company’s perspective, try to find ways to change the today applied transport pricing to more differentiated and compare them to historic payment of transportation. The differentiated pricing would pick up factors as transported unit, assortment, opening hours and topography. The study was divided in three parts. Part 1 involved interviews and questionnaire study with haulage companies. The purpose was to find the needs and the acceptance for differentiated pricing and to find out which factors that is important to include. Part 2 involved calculating of the differentiated factors and construction of models through development of existing models. Part 3 involved an analysis where the costs for the differentiated were compared with the historical payment for transports. The most important factor for the profitability for a haulage company was the opening hours at the receivers, according to the transporters. The effect of the calculation was higher costs on receivers with limited opening hours and lower cost on they with unlimited. The opening hours affects on waiting time, <b>back-hauls,</b> effective working time and the use of the trucks. Longer opening hours could improve these conditions for the haulage companies. That is why companies that work in regions with lower accessibility to receivers with longer opening hours would get a higher payment then the companies with higher accessibility. Topography affected the average speed and the fuel consumption and had biggest effect on them in the regions with difficult topography. Topography had little effects on the total costs, but affects single haulage companies more. The companies that work in difficult regions should have higher payment then the companies that work in more simple regions. The transporters thought that the transports should be priced after ton. There are some alternatives to pricing in ton, for example scaling at the receiver or at a scaling station, crane scaling or through the maximum load weight. Pricing in ton would lead to less differences between the seasons and assortment and it would be easier to control the over loads. But it would require investments in scales. If it not possible with pricing after ton, it should be priced with differentiated conversion values on the assortment. This includes higher costs on the transports and need to be compared to the investment of scales...|$|R
