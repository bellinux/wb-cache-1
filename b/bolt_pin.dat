25|$|A {{lockbolt}} is {{a fastener}} {{similar to a}} bolt in appearance and function. However, instead of using screw threads which connect to a nut using a turning motion, a lockbolt has annular grooves around the shaft of the <b>bolt</b> (<b>pin).</b> After placing the lockbolt in a hole, a threadless collar is forced at high pressures around the annular grooves, deforming the collar and permanently locking it into place around the grooves. Swaging is the generic term for setting a lockbolt and collar assembly. During the installation cycle of a lockbolt, the collar is deformed around the pin with locking grooves using special tooling. The tool engages onto the pintail, which is an extra portion of pin material protruding past the collar that the tool grabs and pulls. This force on the pintail pushes the joint together, and the conically-shaped cavity of the tooling is forced down the collar, which reduces its diameter and progressively swages the collar material into the grooves of the harder pin. As the force required for swaging increases during the process, the installation is finalised when the pintail breaks off.|$|E

50|$|Each PAM {{consists}} of four primary components: a Tandem Forward Charge (TFC), a Follow Through Charge (FTC), a propulsion system, and an electronic fusing system. The PAM is placed against the structure and fires an explosive <b>bolt,</b> <b>pinning</b> the PAM in place.

The FTC is then accelerated by the propulsion system into the newly drilled hole, where it detonates, removing up to 75% of the target's ability to bear loads.|$|R

5000|$|A {{drawback}} of the spaceframe chassis {{is that it}} encloses much of {{the working}} volume {{of the car and}} can make access for both the driver and to the engine difficult. Some spaceframes have been designed with removable sections, joined by <b>bolted</b> <b>pin</b> joints. Such a structure had already been used around the engine of the Lotus Mark III. [...] Although somewhat inconvenient, an advantage of the spaceframe is that the same lack of bending forces in the tubes that allow it to be modelled as a pin-jointed structure also means that such a removable section need not reduce the strength of the assembled frame.|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{decisions}} made by the Marine Accidents Inquiry Agency during the period from 1950 to 1964, investigaion was carried out on the broken parts of engine and their causes. 1. In diesel engines, principal broken parts were propeller shaft, crank arm, crank <b>pin</b> <b>bolt</b> and main bearing. The crack or breakage of crank arm was caused mostly by the deviation of center line of main bearings. The breakage of crank <b>pin</b> <b>bolts</b> was due mostly to excessive or unbalanced tightening. 2. In hot balb engines, nearly one half of damaged engines were due to the breakage of crank arm. When start engine, neglect about exhaust remaining oil in cylinder caused the engine to rapid rotation, and so crank case, piston, cylinder or cylinder cover to damage. 1. 漁船機関損傷の部位とその原因を,デイーゼル機関. 焼玉機関別に海難審判庁の裁決より考察した. 2. 主軸受中心線偏移によるクランク アームのき裂又は折損が最も多く,殊に焼玉機関に於て著しく,早期の開放点検整備が強く要望される. 3. デイーゼル機関に於ては,更に主軸受の焼損及びクランク ピン. ボルトの折損が多く,之等は他の部分の損傷に直接影響のある所で,潤滑油系に対する充分な注意と,ボルト締め付けに際しての細心の留意が肝要である. 4. 焼玉機関の始動時の急回転による損傷が各部に見出され,特に始動失敗の折の慎重な処置が望まれる. 機関損傷の殆どが,極めて基本的な事項の不注意,不処置に起因し,取扱者の充分な点検整備の実行が遂行されるならば,著しく軽減される海難である...|$|R

On the next Impact!, she again teamed with Saeed and Khan in a losing effort to ODB, Taylor Wilde and Roxxi. On the January 22 edition of Impact!, Bolt lost to ODB after via disqualification due to the Kongtourage interfering. On the January 28 edition of Impact!, she competed in a handicap match as she, Rhaka Khan, Raisha Saeed and Awesome Kong defeated ODB.
