5|$|Before the 1956 season, the Giants, who had {{previously}} been renting the Polo Grounds from baseball's Giants {{at a rate of}} $75,000 a year, began playing their home games at Yankee Stadium. The Giants run of championship game appearances in their late 1950s and early 1960s combined with their large market location translated into financial success. In 1958 they set a new home attendance record when 71,163 fans attended their November 8 game against Baltimore. And in 1959 they established their next four highest home game totals by drawing between 66,000 and 68,000 fans for games versus the Eagles, Packers, Browns, and Steelers. By the early 1960s, the Giants were receiving $175,000 a game under the NFL's television contract with CBS—four times as much as small-market Green Bay, {{which was one of the}} most successful teams of the era. However, in the league's new contract, the Maras convinced the other owners that it would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> interest of the NFL to share television revenue equally, a practice which is still current, and is credited with strengthening the NFL. The Giants and professional football as a whole, were helped financially by their contest versus the Baltimore Colts in the 1958 NFL Championship game. The televised game became the first professional football game to go into overtime, and is credited with increasing the popularity of the NFL in the US. The explosion in interest in pro football was evidenced in the Giants financials: in 1956 they had less than 8,000 season ticket holders and by 1963 that number had increased to over 50,000. They sold out every home game in 1962 and 1963. Additionally, while scalpers hardly existed in 1956, by 1963 they regularly received $25 for a $5 ticket.|$|E

Gregory's hagiography was an essential component of this. However, this should not be seen as a selfish grab for power on behalf of the bishops who emerge so triumphantly from the Life of the Fathers, but rather as a bid for hegemony of doctrine and control over the practice of worship, which they believed to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> interests of their congregation and the wider church.|$|E
30|$|We {{draw the}} {{following}} conclusions from Tables  2 and  3. First, the new IQA method correlates well with human opinion scores over all four publicly available image databases; the overall results of <b>the</b> proposed method <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> two results {{except for the}} SROCC on TID 2008. Second, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first average case the proposed method performs better than its competitors. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second average case, the proposed method performs better than its competitors in LCC. Meanwhile, <b>in</b> this case <b>the</b> SROCC average performance of the proposed method is only 0.0422 worse than the ILNIQE. Third, the SROCC values of <b>the</b> proposed method <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> two results for JPEG and GBLUR on LIVE 2, WN and GBLUR on CSIQ, and JEPG 2000 on TID 2008. The LCC values of <b>the</b> proposed method <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> two values for JPEG and GBLUR on LIVE 2, WN on CSIQ, and JPEG 2000 on TID 2008. Even in other circumstances where the prediction results <b>are</b> not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> two, <b>the</b> results of the proposed method maintain competitiveness. Fourth, the newly proposed method outperforms LQF for almost all distortion types. Hence, the features we choose {{for the construction of}} the visual word dictionary are more quality aware. Fifth, when aimed at multiple distortion types, the newly proposed method is adaptable and has an obvious advantage; the SROCC and LCC metrics for the proposed method are among <b>the</b> <b>best</b> two results. Additionally, the two metrics <b>are</b> approximately 0.9 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> comparison experiments conducted on the LiveMD 1 database.|$|R
