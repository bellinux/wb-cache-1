25|$|The {{start of}} the game {{could not have been}} much better for East Carolina or worse for Marshall. On the second play from scrimmage, Leftwich threw a screen pass deep in his own {{territory}} that bounced off the arms of intended receiver Denero Marriott into the hands of Ty Hunt, who returned the interception 12 yards for the game's first touchdown. On Marshall's second possession, a snap out of the shotgun went over Leftwich's right shoulder, and Jerome Stewart picked up the ball and ran it back 43 yards for another Pirates touchdown. Marshall appeared to <b>be</b> <b>finding</b> its rhythm on its third drive, with Leftwich completing five consecutive passes. However, that drive also ended in a turnover, with Leftwich throwing an interception to Stewart in the end zone. The quarter would end with the Pirates up 21-0, with Garrard scoring on a 9-yard run.|$|E

25|$|Doug Wright {{was seen}} as England's trump card {{when he arrived in}} Australia, but he was either the unluckiest or the most over-rated spinner to tour Australia. Don Bradman said he was the best leg-spinner to tour Australia since Sydney Barnes 35 years before, and Keith Miller thought he was the best leg-spinner he knew after Bill O'Reilly. After Tich Freeman retired Wright became Kent's main spinner, taking 2,056 wickets (23.98) and a record seven first class hat-tricks. His long rollicking run up and brisk pace gave away many no-balls and too often he served up full tosses and long hops, but he turned the ball {{fiercely}} and his googly had even the best batsmen groping. His ability to run through a side made him the terror of the County circuit, but he rarely achieved this in Tests. In the Fifth Test at Sydney his 7/105 dismissed Australia for 253 and in 1947 his 10/175 in the Second Test gave England a 10 wicket victory over South Africa. His great asset was that he always looked as if he was about to take a wicket, but in Australia in 1946–47 and again in 1950–51 he proved too expensive and like Bedser was overbowled. Their second leg-spinner was Peter Smith, who was preferred to Eric Hollies because of his batting, but he injured a finger on the journey to Australia and had an appendix removed once there. Even so, he was effective in tour matches - his 9/121 against NSW is the best bowling return by an Englishman in Australia - but was understandably below par in his only Test. James Langridge was a veteran Slow Left Arm bowler who started his trade in 1924, and had taken 92 wickets (22.11) in 1946, but he was 41 years old on his first tour of Australia and just when he appeared to <b>be</b> <b>finding</b> his form he strained a muscle and could not play. Jack Ikin was a part-time leg-spinner whose bowling was thought to be of all round status early in his career (helped by the very poor wickets at Old Trafford), but Hammond used him rarely and he proved to be expensive in the Tests.|$|E
500|$|The {{main problem}} with {{implementing}} such a radical tax would <b>be</b> <b>finding</b> acceptance. [...] Although {{such a system}} might find acceptance within some nations, particularly those (1) {{with a history of}} neutrality, (2) without an active military (such as Costa Rica), or (3) with lower levels of military spending (such as Japan, which currently spends 1% of its GDP on defense), it would be unpopular among many consumers of arms. Nations in this latter category range from the United States, which spends 4% of its GDP on defense, to dictatorships who depend on arms to keep themselves in power. Other likely opponents would be nations engaged in ongoing military conflicts, or others in a state of heightened military alert, such as Israel. Arms producers would also oppose it, because it would increase their costs and possibly reduce their consumer base.|$|E
500|$|After a {{short time}} living with Ehnni's family, the couple {{relocated}} to Algiers. Eberhardt became disappointed with Ehnni, whose only ambition after leaving the army appeared to <b>be</b> <b>finding</b> an unskilled job {{that would allow him}} to live relatively comfortably. She increased her own efforts as a writer, and several of her short stories were printed in the local press. She accepted a job offer from Al-Akhbar (...) newspaper publisher Victor Barrucand in March 1902. Ebrhardt became a regular contributor to the newspaper; Trimardeur began appearing as a serial in August 1903. Barrucand and Eberhardt formed a friendship, though Barrucand was frequently frustrated with his new employee's work ethic. Eberhardt's articles arrived irregularly, as she would only write when she felt like doing so. Her job paid poorly, but had many benefits. Through Barrucand's contacts, Eberhardt was able to access the famous zawiya of Lalla Zaynab. Eberhardt spoke highly of her time with Zaynab, though never disclosed what the two discussed; their meeting, however, caused concern among the French authorities.|$|E

It received critical acclaim unlike the first season. In its [...] "The Top 10 Moments from The Office", IGN ranked Pam's drunken scene at Chili's as number five. Michael Sciannamea of TV Squad stated that [...] "This season's first episode showed a marked improvement over the final episode from last season", and went on to praise the episode's expansion of supporting characters as one of the main reasons for the improvement. In a Flashback review, Travis Fickett of IGN complimented the episode for creating the personalities of the supporting characters and for the workers affection towards Michael in the episode. He also praised the Jim and Pam moments in the episode. He ultimately gave the episode a 9.0/10.

Poniewozik added, [...] "'Pawnee Zoo' was spot-on, and had me cracking up beginning to end." [...] Henning Fog of Entertainment Weekly said with [...] "Pawnee Zoo", the series appeared to <b>be</b> <b>finding</b> its rhythm and starting to distinguish itself from its conceptual spinoff, The Office, which was also created by Parks and Recreation co-creator Greg Daniels. Fog also felt bringing real social issues into the show was a positive direction for the series. Emily Christianson of the Los Angeles Times said [...] "Pawnee Zoo" [...] improves upon the first season by giving more attention to plot points outside the pit. Christianson particularly enjoyed the scenes with Leslie drunk in the bar, and liked {{the introduction of the}} Ann and Mark romance. Los Angeles Times writer Jon Caramanica said the same-sex marriage subplot only alters the show's dynamic [...] "a smidge", and mainly serves as [...] "another opportunity for misadventure for Leslie Knope".

[...] David Hinckley of the Daily News rated the episode 4 out of 5 stars and commented: [...] "Glee could have a hard time sustaining what it has set up.

Raymund Flandez for The Wall Street Journal praised this performance, also describing the group performance of [...] "Push It" [...] as [...] "glorious in encapsulating every teenage horror". Discussing the performance of [...] "Gold Digger", Dave Itzkoff for The New York Times wrote: [...] "Outside of the catalog of 2 Live Crew, it's hard to imagine a song more inappropriate for a high school glee club [...] but the young misfits of the Fox comedy Glee somehow made it work." ...|$|E

500|$|The title's {{controls}} and overall gameplay {{were not as}} well-received, with certain critics questioning their accuracy and depth. MacDonald finished every level in first place within one hour using {{only one of the}} four initial characters. While the game also features a hard mode, MacDonald concluded that [...] "Sonic R has more in the personality department than in the depth department". MacDonald and Reiner cited finding the Chaos Emeralds and hidden coins as [...] "difficult", but MacDonald argued that such optional tasks offered little in return, because the hidden characters [...] "are mostly robot versions of the already playable ones". Moreover, Sackenheim noted that the game's controls initially [...] "take some practice to get used to", but added: [...] "Start sliding around corners and letting off the gas at the right times and you'll <b>be</b> <b>finding</b> all of the secrets that Sonic R conceals in no time".

500|$|... "Society Hill" [...] {{was written}} by Matthew V.

Daniel Licht {{who has worked on}} the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for the episode. Actress Nadia Dajani (best known for her role in Ned & Stacey) guest starred in the episode as Lauren Matthews. Joanna Cassidy (best known for her role in Six Feet Under) made her first appearance as Joan Hunt, Megan's mother. Cassidy was reportedly originally meant to first appear in the third episode of the first season, [...] "Helping Hand". Series creator Christopher Murphey said of Cassidy's role as Joan, [...] "I get this weird chill when I write scenes for the two of them, it's a wonderful dynamic, I think Megan and her mother have a wonderful back story that we will be basically mining over the first few episode's.

2500|$|The last England pair {{continued}} to frustrate the Australian bowlers {{for the first}} few overs of day four, adding an extra 9 runs for the last wicket, but eventually Malcolm was out caught behind off Merv Hughes for 9, and England's first innings came to a close for 255 in 76.5 overs. Still 347 behind the Australian total, Border had no hesitation in making England follow on. Captain Gower decided [...] that a captain's innings leading from the front was necessary, and promoted himself to number one in the order. Despite striking one glorious 4, it backfired spectacularly when he was out for 5 on the fifth ball of the innings, clean bowled by Geoff Lawson. Curtis added 6 and there was to be no heroics from Smith in the second innings, out for 26 to leave England at 67 for 3. Debutant Atherton looked to <b>be</b> <b>finding</b> his feet, despite being {{on the receiving end of}} some hostile bowling, and even more hostile sledging from Merv Hughes, and moved awkwardly on towards 50.

2500|$|The story follows Sakura, a 14-year-old princess who'd rather marry {{for love}} and make her own choices in life than be married away to someone she's never met. Her best friend is Asagiri, a cute female Mononoke (a tiny spirit) who she once saved from a life of slavery (unbeknownst to her, Asagiri is really a Yuki-Onna). Since birth, she's been engaged to Prince Oura. Not wanting to marry the prince after a {{precarious}} argument with Prince Oura's messenger, named Aoba, Sakura runs away but gets lost and accidentally looks at the full moon, which she was warned to never do. A man-eating demon arrives, referring to Sakura as [...] "Princess Kaguya" [...] and nearly wounds her, but Aoba and a priestess that Sakura knows named Byakuya arrive. Priestess Byakuya tells Sakura that she is in fact Princess Kaguya's granddaughter {{and is the only}} one able to destroy the demons. By drawing a pair of back-to-back crescent moons on her palm, she is able to summon the mystic sword Chizakura and kill the demon. She also discovers the word “destroy” is actually her Soul Symbol (a symbol each person possesses that best represents his or her true nature). Soon after, Sakura, Asagiri, and Aoba travel to Prince Oura's estate, where it's discovered that Aoba actually is Prince Oura, explaining {{that he wanted to be}} mischievous. Of course, the two don't get along from then on, until finally while relaxing under a tree, the two finally seem to come to an understanding, and do appear to <b>be</b> <b>finding</b> the silver lining in their arranged engagement. Unfortunately, she is soon under threat of execution, as Aoba turns on her, as he's afraid that she will eventually become a demon herself, like her mother and grandmother before her. Aoba shoots an arrow through her chest and Sakura falls into a river, only to be found by a cute and sassy young ninja named Kohaku and her childhood friend Hayate, who used to be human but was accidentally turned into a frog by Kohaku (although he regains his human form during the full moon). While with Kohaku, the two form a nice friendship, and Sakura reveals that she is being hunted by Kohaku's master, who just so happens to be Aoba. Kohaku though in return admits already knowing this, and tells that she doesn't wish to harm her, and wants to protect her. The two, along with Asagiri and Hayate, soon encounter Aoba and his men, and Volume 1 ends with Sakura being affected by a youko whistle that Aoba has.|$|E
