Rivers <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of surrogate father to the troubled young man, and his sudden death in 1922 was a major blow to Sassoon.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, Dolci {{published}} {{a series of}} books (notably, in their English translations, To Feed the Hungry, 1955, and Waste, 1960) that stunned the outside world with their emotional force and the detail with which he depicted the desperate conditions of the Sicilian countryside {{and the power of}} the Mafia. Dolci <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of cult hero in the United States and Northern Europe; he was idolised, in particular by idealistic youngsters, and support committees were formed to raise funds for his projects.|$|E

25|$|Counterbalancing {{the lack}} of tours, the band set up an annual {{tradition}} of one-off large-scale London concerts (the first of which took place on 11 November 2000 and the last in 2007). These usually took place in November at the London Astoria, and soon <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of Cardiacs family gathering in which the band was joined by various guests including former members and newer Cardiacs-inspired supported bands. During these concerts, Sarah Smith, William D. Drake, Christian Hayes and Dominic Luckman all appeared onstage with the band on various occasions, as did The Consultant and Miss Swift. Support bands were always musicians with a professed Cardiacs connection or influence, and included Oceansize, The Monsoon Bassoon, The Scaramanga Six, Stars In Battledress and Jon Poole's hard-rock band GodDamnWhores.|$|E
25|$|Originally, perhaps, each town {{clustered}} {{round one}} temple, and each head of {{family had a}} right to minister there and share its receipts. As the city grew, the right to so many days a year at one shrine (or its gate) descended within certain families and <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of property that could be pledged, rented or shared within the family, but not alienated. Despite all these demands, the temples became great granaries and storehouses and were also the city archives. The temple had its responsibilities. If a citizen was captured by the enemy and could not ransom himself, the temple of his city must do so. To the temple came the poor farmer to borrow seed, grain, or supplies for harvesters, etc.—advances that he repaid without interest.|$|E

500|$|I've {{heard it}} said about The Velvet Underground that while {{not a lot}} of people bought their albums, {{everyone}} who did started a band. I think this is largely true about the Pixies as well. Charles' secret weapon turned out to be not so secret and, sooner or later, all sorts of bands were exploiting the same strategy of wide dynamics. It <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of new pop formula and, within a short while, [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] was charging up the charts and even the members of Nirvana said later that it sounded for all the world like a Pixies song.|$|E
500|$|In {{historical}} terms, the Shangani Patrol subsequently {{became an}} integral part of Rhodesian identity, with Wilson and Borrow in particular woven into the national tapestry as heroic figures symbolising duty in the face of insuperable odds. Their last stand together <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of national myth, as Lewis Gann writes, [...] "a glorious memory, [...] own equivalent of the bloody Alamo massacre and Custer's Last Stand in the American West". In 1895, 4 December was declared [...] "Shangani Day", an annual Rhodesian public holiday which endured until 1920, when it was folded into Occupation Day, a national non-work day which commemorated several early colonial events together. Shangani Day remained part of the national calendar, however, and was still marked each year.|$|E
500|$|A form of {{cinematic}} punctuation {{very strongly}} identified with Kurosawa is the wipe. This is an effect created through an optical printer, in which, when a scene ends, a line or bar appears to {{move across the}} screen, [...] "wiping" [...] away the image while simultaneously revealing the first image of the subsequent scene. As a transitional device, it {{is used as a}} substitute for the straight cut or the dissolve (though Kurosawa often used both of those devices as well). In his mature work, Kurosawa employed the wipe so frequently that it <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of signature. For example, one blogger has counted no fewer than 12 instances of the wipe in Drunken Angel. Kurosawa by all accounts always gave great attention to the soundtracks of his films, especially with an emphasis on sound-image counterpoint, in which the music or sound effects would ironically comment upon the image rather than merely reinforcing it. (Teruyo Nogami's memoir gives several such examples from Drunken Angel and Stray Dog.) He was also involved with several of Japan's outstanding contemporary composers, including Fumio Hayasaka (who died in 1955) and the internationally famous Toru Takemitsu.|$|E

500|$|According to Brook, [...] "in every age, {{a heroic}} sage struggles to rescue Benjamin from obscurity—and {{invariably}} fails." [...] Benjamin left no memoir and destroyed his personal papers, by which [...] "the task of future researchers and historians was made exceedingly difficult and laborious". [...] After his death, Benjamin was rarely written about, {{in contrast to}} Davis and other Confederate leaders. [...] Part of {{this was due to}} Benjamin depriving his potential biographers of source material, but even Davis, in his two-volume war memoir, mentions him only twice. Evans suggests that as Davis wrote the books in part to defend and memorialize his place in history, {{it would not have been}} characteristic of him to give much credit to Benjamin. Davis, in the midst of postwar business struggles, may have resented Benjamin's success as a barrister, or may have feared that allegations of involvement in Lincoln's assassination would again be made against the two men. Brook concurs that Benjamin's postwar success, that began as Davis lay in prison and other Confederates struggled for survival, may have soured Southerners towards the former secretary, but that anti-Semitism was also likely a factor. [...] "For the guardians of Confederate memory after Reconstruction, Benjamin <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of pet Jew, generally ignored, but then trotted out at opportune moments to defend the segregated South against charges of bigotry." ...|$|E
500|$|Colonial-era {{histories}} {{called this}} the Shangani Patrol, and hailed Wilson and Borrow as national heroes. Their last stand together <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of national myth, as Lewis Gann writes, [...] "a glorious memory, [...] own {{equivalent of the}} bloody Alamo massacre and Custer's Last Stand in the American West". The version of events recorded by history {{is based on the}} accounts of Burnham, Ingram and Gooding, the Matabele present at the battle (particularly inDuna Mjaan), and the men of Forbes' column. While all of the direct evidence given by eyewitnesses supports the findings of the Court of Inquiry, some historians and writers debate whether or not Burnham, Ingram and Gooding really were sent back by Wilson to fetch help, and suggest that they might have simply deserted when the battle got rough. The earliest recording of this claim of desertion is long after the event in a letter written in 1935 by John Coghlan to a friend, John Carruthers, that [...] "a very reliable man informed me that Wools-Sampson told him" [...] that Gooding had confessed on his deathbed that he and the two Americans had not actually been despatched by Wilson, and had simply left on their own accord. This double hearsay confession, coming from an anonymous source, is not mentioned in Gooding's 1899 obituary, which instead recounts the events as generally recorded. Several well-known writers have used the Coghlan letter, as shaky as it is, as clearance to create hypothetical evidence in an attempt to challenge and revise the historical record.|$|E

2500|$|The {{inscriptions}} on the sarcophagi {{also suggest}} that the hypogeum was complete about 150 BC.

[...] The creation of a solemn [...] "rupestre" [...] facade also dates to that period. The decoration is attributed to the initiative of Scipio Aemilianus, and is a fundamental example of Hellenization of Roman culture in the course of 2nd century BC.
