50|$|Outside of North America, <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Japan {{owns and}} {{operates}} 279 <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Hamburger Steak & Grill Restaurants throughout Japan. Founded in 1977, <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Japan now also operates 45 Victoria Station restaurants in Japan and is a subsidiary of Zénsho Holdings Co., Ltd. The Japanese <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Restaurants do not offer the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> hamburger or most other American <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> menu items, offering a distinct menu instead. They also offer beer and wine.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> {{served at}} Frisch's is {{slightly}} different than those at other <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> restaurants. Where Bob Wian dressed <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> hamburgers with mayonnaise and red relish, Frisch later replaced these with tartar sauce and added dill pickles in his version and applied these {{in a different}} order. (Early Frisch's menus show that he used tartar sauce on hamburgers and cheeseburgers, but mayonnaise on his <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> hamburgers.) Frisch's licensee Manners <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> used a similar tartar sauce on its <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> hamburger. The use of tartar sauce on Frisch's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> hamburgers wasn't {{simply a matter of}} taste. Frisch recognized the use of a single combined condiment was simpler and faster. Later the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> system adopted the idea, using the combined form of red relish and mayonnaise, commonly known as thousand island dressing, on <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> hamburgers.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1980s, Marriott {{planned to}} retire the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> character. As a {{publicity}} scheme, Marriott launched a [...] "Should <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Stay or Go?" [...] campaign, asking customers at Frisch's and other <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> franchises {{to vote on}} whether or not the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> should continue to be used for the trademark. Voters and loyal customers overwhelmingly voted that <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> should stay.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Bob's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> name, the [...] "Big Boy" [...] concept, menu, and mascot were originally licensed to a wide number of regional franchise holders (listed in the next section). Because many of the early franchisees were already {{in the restaurant business}} when joining <b>Big</b> <b>Boy,</b> [...] "Big Boy" [...] was added to the franchisee name just as the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> hamburger was added to the franchisee's menu. In this sense it is confusing when referring to a chain, as each named franchisee was itself a chain and <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> could be considered a chain of chains. People tend to know <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> not simply as <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> but as the franchise from where they lived such as Bob's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> in California, Shoney's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> in the south or Frisch's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> in much of Ohio, among the many others.|$|R
5000|$|Adventures of the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> (or Adventures of <b>Big</b> <b>Boy)</b> was {{a promotional}} comic book given free to {{children}} visiting the restaurants. Intended to [...] "give the kids {{something to do}} while they waited for their food", the book involves the escapades of <b>Big</b> <b>Boy,</b> his girlfriend Dolly and dog Nugget. From the comic books children could also join the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Club, a kids club offering them free <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> hamburgers, decoder cards and other premiums. Later changed to <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Magazine the serial had distribution once estimated at three million copies.|$|R
50|$|Frisch's (Ohio, Kentucky, S. Indiana, Tennessee; Florida {{until the}} early 1990s, 1947+, founded by David Frisch) The Cincinnati {{restaurant}} chain and first franchisee, began serving <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> hamburgers in 1946, but opened their first <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Drive-In restaurant in 1948; Frisch's now operates 96 <b>Big</b> <b>Boys</b> and franchises 25 <b>Big</b> <b>Boys</b> to others. Frisch's subfranchised to Azar's and Manners, which used the Frisch's styled <b>Big</b> <b>Boy,</b> to Milton and David Bennett in 1955, who operate as Frisch's in northwest Ohio and also licensed Elby's to operate three <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> units in the upper Ohio Valley until 1971. In 2001 Frisch's became the perpetual owner of the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> trademark in most of Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana and Tennessee, and received $1.2 million to relinquish all other <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> territories to <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Restaurants International, to whom Frisch's {{is no longer a}} franchisee or licensee. On August 24, 2015, Frisch's was sold to an Atlanta-based private equity fund, ending family ownership and control of the chain.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> {{was started}} as Bob's Pantry in 1936 by Bob Wian in Glendale, California. The {{restaurant}} {{became known as}} [...] "Bob's, Home of the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Hamburger" [...] then as Bob's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy.</b> It became a local chain under that name and nationally under the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> name, franchised by Robert C. Wian Enterprises. Marriott Corporation bought <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> in 1967. One of the larger franchise operators, Elias Brothers, purchased the chain from Marriott in 1987, moved {{the headquarters of the}} company to Warren, Michigan, and operated it until bankruptcy was declared in 2000. During the bankruptcy, the chain was sold to investor Robert Liggett, Jr., who took over as Chairman, renamed the company <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Restaurants International and maintained the headquarters in Warren. The company is the operator or franchisor for 83 <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> restaurants in the United States. <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Restaurants International also licenses 279 <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> restaurants operating in Japan.|$|R
50|$|Immediately after Liggett's purchase, <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Restaurants International - {{then known}} as Liggett Restaurant Enterprises - {{negotiated}} {{an agreement with the}} other large franchise operator, Frisch's Restaurants. The <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> trademarks in Kentucky, Indiana, and most of Ohio and Tennessee transferred to Frisch's ownership; all other Frisch's territories transferred to Liggett. (As a franchisee, the bankruptcy threatened Frisch's future use of the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> trademark.) Thus Frisch's is no longer a franchisee, but <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Restaurants International and Frisch's are now independent co-registrants of the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> name and trademark. Frisch's operates or franchises 121 <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> restaurants in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Union Pacific 4006, one of {{the largest}} steam {{locomotives}} ever built, is a 4-8-8-4 <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> locomotive that was built in 1941 and retired in 1961 and is one of eight surviving <b>Big</b> <b>Boys.</b> This <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> also has the most mileage of all the <b>Big</b> <b>Boys</b> during its service years, traveling 1,064,625 miles.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{most modern}} franchises, the {{historic}} <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> franchisees differed somewhat {{from one another}} in pricing and menus. After purchasing <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> in 1987, Elias Brothers intended to standardize the name and menu, but Bob's, Frisch's and McDowell's (now known as Bismarck <b>Big</b> <b>Boy)</b> continue to offer distinctions from the standard <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> menu.|$|R
50|$|Vip's (New Mexico, Texas, Wyoming, 19621982. {{founded by}} Daniel T. Hogan and James O'Conner) Vip's refers to two {{distinct}} restaurant chains. The <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> franchisee relevant here, Vip's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> of New Mexico, {{was acquired by}} JB's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> in 1972 but continued using the Vip's name until rebranded in 1982. The other, Vip's Restaurants of Salem, Oregon, was not a <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> franchisee but sold units to JB's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy,</b> which operated them as Bob's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy.</b> The non-Big Boy, Salem-based chain had 53 locations at its peak, all sold and rebranded, including 35 to Denny's in 1982 and 16 to JB's in 1984.|$|R
50|$|Marc's (Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, 19581995, {{founded by}} Ben Marcus and Gene Kilberg) Owned by the Marcus Corporation, Marc's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> debuted in Milwaukee in November 1958. The chain grew to 4 units by 1962, 22 units by 1970 and {{eventually}} operated {{as many as}} 64 <b>Big</b> <b>Boys</b> over a 4 state territory. A two-year experiment completely removing <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> at two of its stores ended in 1991 demonstrated no effect on business. In 1992, the Marc's format was upscaled and renamed Marc's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Cafes; in 1993 13 <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Cafes were converted to Marc's Cafe and Coffee Mills, and the company launched 2 <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Express drive-thru stores. The following year, the 13 Cafe and Coffee Mill restaurants were sold {{to a group of}} employees, with 3 remaining <b>Big</b> <b>Boys</b> and 2 <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Express units offered for sale. In 1995, the company closed its last <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> operation. Some former units later operated as Annie's American Cafe and as Perkins Restaurants. However, in 2017 the Marcus Corporation sells <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> hamburgers at the Kil@wat restaurant in its downtown Milwaukee hotel; in March 2017, the sandwich is priced at $12 on the lunch menu and $10 on the dinner menu where it is listed as an appetizer and served quartered.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> {{developed}} named franchisees {{in several}} ways. Very quickly the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> name {{and even the}} <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> character were being widely used without permission. Bob Wian, needing diverse exposure for national (U.S.) trademark protection, offered very generous franchise agreements to Frisch's, Eat'n Park and Parkette (Shoney's). In 1952, Wian instituted a formal franchise process and Elias Brothers became the first such [...] "official" [...] franchisee. Bob Wian also settled trademark infringements allowing the rogue operator to become a licensed franchisee, such as McDowell's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> in North Dakota. Subfranchisees often used their own name and operated independently: Frisch's licensed Azar's, and Manners; Shoney's licensed Arnold's, Becker's, Elby's, Lendy's, Shap's, Tune's, and Yoda's. Elby’s licensed Franklin's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> in eastern Pennsylvania. Acquisitions and mergers also occurred. In the early 1970s Frisch's acquired Kip's Big Boy; JB's acquired Vip's, Kebo's, Leo's and Bud's which were rebranded JB's. After buying <b>Big</b> <b>Boy,</b> Elias Brothers bought Elby's and TJ's. Elby's was unique in leaving and rejoining the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> system. When Marriott purchased <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> (Wian Enterprises) in 1967, this included Bob's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy.</b> The name “Bob’s” would be used by all Marriott owned <b>Big</b> <b>Boys</b> and became common {{in parts of the}} eastern U.S. and elsewhere, far away from Bob’s historic territory.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, Frisch's {{purchased}} Kip's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> which covered Texas, Oklahoma {{and areas}} of Kansas. In 1988, in exchange for allowing Elias Brothers to operate (former Elby's and Manner's) <b>Big</b> <b>Boys</b> in Ohio, Frisch's received <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> rights in parts of Tennessee and Georgia. Frisch's ended Kip's operations in 1991, and sold that territory as well as Georgia and Florida to <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Restaurants International in 2001.|$|R
5000|$|Frisch's {{now owns}} the [...] "Big Boy" [...] {{name in a}} defined four state region, and Azar's and Bob's are {{licensed}} by Frisch's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> and <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Restaurants International, respectively. Many of the other former franchise owners (Shoney's, particularly) have expanded into the former territories of other franchise holders. Prohibiting franchisees from publicly using their own names is intended to strengthen the trademark but also prevent defections, such as happened with Shoney's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> retaining identity as Shoney's. The same occurred with Eat'n Park, Elby's, Lendy's, JB's, and Abdow's who kept their names after leaving <b>Big</b> <b>Boy.</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> now permits operators to informally identify by location such as Tawas Bay <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> in East Tawas, Michigan.|$|R
5000|$|Because of the {{distinct}} East and West Coast <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> mascots, dual versions of Adventures were produced, identical {{except for the}} detail of the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> figure. In July 1969 the versions merged, and a fluffy brown haired <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> appeared. In 1976 Shoney's discontinued use of the Marriott book, publishing their own instead. Contracted to Paragon Products, this version featured an older, leaner <b>Big</b> <b>Boy,</b> with his siblings Katie and Tripp replacing Dolly and Nugget, and {{was adopted by the}} JB's and Azar's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> franchises. [...] After 75 issues it became Shoney's Fun and Adventure Magazine introducing a Shoney's mascot ("Uncle Ed" [...] bear) in place of <b>Big</b> <b>Boy,</b> allowing it to serve Shoney's non-Big Boy restaurants.|$|R
5000|$|In 1960, 1966 and 1969 Frisch's {{licensed}} three Elby's <b>Big</b> <b>Boys</b> in {{the upper}} Ohio Valley area of Ohio. After the death of Dave Frisch, a fourth Ohio Elby's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> prepared to open in 1971, but Frisch's unexpectedly demanded much higher fees for the unit. In response, Elby's cancelled all ties to Frisch's and operated independently of <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> in Ohio, including in direct competition to Frisch's in the Columbus market. Protracted litigation followed as Frisch's sued Elby's [...] and eventually Shoney's for operating non-Big Boy restaurants in Frisch's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> territory, while operating <b>Big</b> <b>Boys</b> in neighboring states. Overall, the lawsuits were unsuccessful and both Elby's and Shoney's dropped <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> affiliation completely.|$|R
5000|$|In 1982, Shoney's began {{launching}} {{restaurants in}} Florida and Kentucky, branded as [...] "Shoney's Towne and Country" [...] because Frisch's owned the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> rights in these states. Nonetheless, Frisch's sued for trademark infringement, claiming a strong {{association of the}} [...] "Shoney's" [...] name with [...] "Big Boy". While these lawsuits failed, similar suits by Frisch's against Elby's complicated Elby's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> advertising in the upper Ohio Valley. Therefore, in 1984 Shoney's broke affiliation with <b>Big</b> <b>Boy.</b> At {{the time it was}} the largest <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> franchisee, with 392 Shoney's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> restaurants. As a result, the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> sandwich was renamed the [...] "All-American Hamburger," [...] and Shoney Bear was created as a corporate mascot.|$|R
50|$|Originally, the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> {{hamburger}} was {{the only}} common menu item required of all <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> franchisees.|$|R
50|$|Doubling in size {{every four}} years, Shoney's became the largest <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> franchisee, {{operating}} over {{one third of}} the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> restaurants nationwide. As Shoney's dominated <b>Big</b> <b>Boy,</b> a 1959 franchisee named Raymond Danner would dominate Shoney's, acquiring the company in 1971.|$|R

50|$|JB's (Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Wyoming, Washington, California, New Mexico, Nevada, Nebraska, Kansas, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut; 19611988, {{founded by}} Jack M. Broberg.) The first JB's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> opened in 1961 in Provo, Utah. In the 1970s JB's {{expanded}} by acquiring neighboring <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> franchisees: Vip's, Leo's, Kebo's and Bud's. After Marriott refused granting additional territory, in 1984, JB's sued to leave <b>Big</b> <b>Boy.</b> The parties settled, JB's paying $7 million {{in exchange for}} additional territory, including central and northern California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada and Arizona where it operated as Bob's Big Boy; JB's also purchased 29 existing Bob's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> restaurants from Marriott. Citing the sale of <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> to Elias Brothers, in 1988 JB's allowed its <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> franchise to expire, removing 107 units from the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> system. As of December 2016, fifteen JB's Restaurants operate in five states.|$|R
50|$|Shoney's (the Parkette) was {{originally}} the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> franchisee for West Virginia; however, Schoenbaum rapidly grew the chain through subfranchising, expanding his <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> territory through the southeastern United States, excluding Florida {{only because the}} rights already belonged to fellow <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> franchisee Frisch's.|$|R

50|$|Following his {{sporting}} career, Schoenbaum went on {{to found}} the Shoney's restaurant chain, a regional organization {{which is one of}} the largest businesses to have originated in West Virginia and was at one time one of the largest family owned restaurant chains in the United States. In 1947 Schoenbaum opened his first drive-in restaurant, Parkette, in Charleston. In 1952, Schoenbaum obtained the regional marketing rights to the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> trademark, two years later Parkette being renamed Shoney's. Besides being an operator, Schoenbaum also aggressively subfranchised to others, many as Shoney's and some in the 1950s using their own name. In 1971, Schoenbaum and one such subfranchisee, Nashville operator Raymond L. Danner merged their companies to form Shoney's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Enterprises, Inc. When Shoney's original franchise agreement with <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> expired in 1976, <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Enterprises was dropped from the name. In the 1980s Shoney's opened two non <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> restaurants (called Shoney's Towne and Country) outside of its assigned <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> territory, leading Frisch's restaurants, another <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> franchisee to sue for trademark infringement. In 1984, Shoney's-now the largest regional franchisee-left the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> system removing over a third of the American units. Shoney's prevailed in the trademark suit, the final appeal adjudicated after separation from <b>Big</b> <b>Boy.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Restaurants International, LLC is an American {{restaurant}} chain headquartered in Warren, Michigan, in Metro Detroit. Frisch's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Restaurants is a {{restaurant chain}} with {{its headquarters in}} Cincinnati, Ohio. The <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> name, design aesthetic, and menu were previously licensed {{to a number of}} regional franchisees.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> {{and other}} {{drive-in}} restaurants could {{not compete with}} the spreading fast food restaurants such as McDonald's and Burger King. <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> built its last drive-in in 1964 and by 1976 only 5 of the chain's 930 restaurants offered curb service. <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> redefined itself as full service in contrast to fast food. Nonetheless, in the late 1960s and 1970s Bob's, Shoney's and JB's also opened <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Jr. stores, designed as fast food operations which offered a limited menu. Sometimes called drive-ins, these junior stores did not use carhops. In 1993 Marc's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> similarly developed <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Express stores using dual drive-thrus and no interior dining area. Two Express stores were built, offered for sale a year later and closed in 1995.|$|R

50|$|Being {{the first}} franchisee, {{an ad hoc}} {{arrangement}} allowed Dave Frisch unique freedoms. His double-deck <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> hamburger was slightly different than Wian's. Dave Frisch also created his own <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> character: a thinner boy with reddish or blond hair, wearing striped rather than checkered overalls, presented in a running or skipping pose. Known as the East Coast <b>Big</b> <b>Boy,</b> this mark represented Frisch's and its licensees Manners and Azar's through 1969. Most Frisch's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> restaurants still display statues from this design, albeit usually repainted with brown hair and checkered overalls. In 2017 a redesigned statue resembling the West Coast <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> was introduced.|$|R
