5|$|In {{recognition}} of his work successfully organising the Games Kent Hughes was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1957. An award presented by the Victorian Olympic Council to the athlete it considers to have given the most outstanding performance at a Games is named in his honour and Kent Hughes's significance to the modern Olympic movement is such {{that it has been}} suggested that an oil portrait of Kent Hughes <b>be</b> <b>commissioned</b> and placed in the Olympic Museum in Lausanne.|$|E

5|$|The 500MW Sampur Power Station was {{in early}} stages of {{development}} since 2006, but was subsequently cancelled in 2016 due environmental concerns. Prior to its cancellation, the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy also made a statement that no more coal-fired power stations will <b>be</b> <b>commissioned,</b> making Lakvijaya the only coal-fired power station in the country. Any future thermal power stations will also be natural gas–run, to reduce the nation's carbon footprint.|$|E
5|$|The one in JRM {{service was}} {{relocated}} to Montenegro {{where it would}} <b>be</b> <b>commissioned</b> with the Navy of the new FR Yugoslavia. The second ship that was captured unfinished was completed by Croatian forces and entered service with the HRM, followed by a third that was laid down by Croatia in 1993. The two ships commissioned with the HRM remain in active service, providing assistance to civilian institutions aside from their regular military tasks. The fate of the first ship in the class remains unknown.|$|E

5|$|Two endings {{were created}} for the special. The {{alternative}} ending is included on the DVD release of Green Wing, along with deleted scenes from the episode. The alternative ending was planned to be used if a third series was going to <b>be</b> <b>commissioned,</b> as this ending was much more ambiguous. It is known that the actors wanted the alternative ending, but after some debate, it was not shown.|$|E
5|$|Briton was {{the first}} of the trio to <b>be</b> <b>commissioned</b> and was {{assigned}} to the East Indies Station in 1871. She remained there for four and a half years, mostly engaged on the suppression of the slave trade. The ship was refitted and rearmed upon her return home and Briton remained in reserve until recommissioned in 1881 for service on the Cape Station. She was transferred back to the East Indies after two years on the Cape. Her crew was relieved in 1884 by another sent out from Britain and the ship remained on station until she was sold, less her armament, in Bombay in 1887.|$|E
5|$|By 1835 {{the idea}} of {{building}} a railway from Glasgow into Ayrshire gained sufficient support for a survey to <b>be</b> <b>commissioned</b> from John Miller, {{a partner in the}} firm of Grainger and Miller, which had been heavily involved in the earlier railways in the west of Scotland. Miller proposed a route from Tradeston, in Glasgow {{at the south end of}} Glasgow Bridge, through Paisley and the Garnock Valley to Kilwinning and Ayr, with a branch from Dalry to Kilmarnock. The cost was to be £550,000 and a 10% return could be expected; notwithstanding the south-westerly course of the line, it was foreseen as a first step towards linking with railways in England.|$|E

5|$|Crusader {{was built}} by the Melbourne Harbour Trust at Williamstown Dockyard. She was the largest {{all-welded}} steel vessel to have been constructed in Australia at the time, and her final price of £124,000 was considerably more than Steele's deliberate underestimate. The ship was launched on 8 August 1945 after being named by Steele's wife, and later became the largest ship to <b>be</b> <b>commissioned</b> by the Australian Army during World War II. Construction of a sister ship, to be called AV2768 Corsair, was also begun, but this ship was cancelled when the war ended.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the changes}} to the design and its growing costs, {{construction}} of three DDLs {{was approved by the}} Liberal Party McMahon Government in August 1972. At this time, the total project cost was estimated at A$355 million; this figure included all costs associated with building three ships and operating them for ten years. The ships themselves were expected to cost approximately $210 million. All three ships were to be built at Williamstown Dockyard, with construction of the first ship beginning in 1975, followed by the other ships at two-yearly intervals. The initial DDL was to <b>be</b> <b>commissioned</b> in 1980, and the third in 1984. Further DDLs may also have been ordered over time to replace the Navy's destroyers as they reached the end of their service lives.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the site}} was {{considered}} for scheduling by English Heritage, because of its national importance as {{a good example of}} a late 20th-century power station. It was also important because of its use as a testing ground for various generating sizes, from which came success in the UK's electricity industry. However, by then the station's buildings were in poor condition {{and it would have been}} financially difficult to ensure their long term preservation. Instead, it was decided a comprehensive study and photographic record of the station would <b>be</b> <b>commissioned.</b>|$|E

5|$|In August 1943, {{recruiting}} {{policies were}} changed to permit SPARS to marry {{men of the}} USCG without having to resign. The USCG would continue to accept applicants who were married to men in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps, but would not accept {{a woman who was}} already married to an enlisted man or an officer serving in the USCG. However, women could join the SPARS if their husbands were enrolled as temporary members of the reserve. In November 1943, the marriage policy with respect to recruits was changed further to permit women who were wives of cadets, warrant officers, or enlisted men of the USCG to enlist or <b>be</b> <b>commissioned</b> in the SPARs. The ban remained on women whose husbands were commissioned officers in the USCG with the rank of ensign or above.|$|E
5|$|Initially Los Alamos was {{supposed}} to be a military laboratory, and Oppenheimer and other researchers were to <b>be</b> <b>commissioned</b> into the Army. He went so far as to order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform and take the Army physical test, which he failed. Army doctors considered him underweight at , diagnosed his chronic cough as tuberculosis and were concerned about his chronic lumbosacral joint pain. The plan to commission scientists fell through when Robert Bacher and Isidor Rabi balked at the idea. Conant, Groves, and Oppenheimer devised a compromise whereby the laboratory was operated by the University of California under contract to the War Department. It soon turned out that Oppenheimer had hugely underestimated the magnitude of the project; Los Alamos grew from a few hundred people in 1943 to over 6,000 in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Laid up at Chatham {{during the}} years of peace, Bellerophon was not {{commissioned}} until July 1790, when the crisis known as the Spanish Armament broke out. As war with Spain threatened, warships lying in ordinary began to <b>be</b> <b>commissioned</b> and fitted for sea. Bellerophons first commander, Captain Thomas Pasley, arrived on 19 July and began the process of preparing her for service. After a month spent fitting out the ship with guns, masts, stores and rigging, and recruiting a crew, Pasley gave the orders for his crew to slip the moorings on 16 August, and Bellerophon made her way down the Medway to the fleet anchorage at the Nore.|$|E
