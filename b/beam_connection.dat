Deep beam recieved loadings from upper shear walls and distribute to the widely spaced columns or deep beams that support the shear walls. The development of construction industry contributed negative effect to our environment in term of wastage of construction materials. Taking sustainable development into account, the concrete industry needs to apply a variety of strategies concerning future concrete use. Crushed Concrete waste Aggregate (CCwA) was identified {{as one of the}} best alternative to replace the natural aggregate. The knowledge on the effectiveness of CCwA as replacement to natural aggregate was inadequate. This research used CCwA as coarse aggregate to replace natural aggregate in the concrete mix wall-deep beam specimen were constructed to investigate the performance of wall-deep beam when using CCwA as course aggregate. This research will be carrying out experimentally. Two specimen of wall-deep beam were designed and prepared. The deep beam size was 200 x 1000 x 600 (Thickness: Length: Height) and the wall was 70 x 100 x 1000 (width: length: height). This dimension was reduced by half from the actual dimension to fulfill the testing facilities. CCwA was used in full course aggregate as replacement over natural aggregate.

40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: In {{the recent}} past {{a number of issues}} {{regarding}} the seismic performance of typical existing hollowcore floor systems have been raised. The most concerning of these is the vulnerability to loss of vertical support of the floor system at the end floor to seating <b>beam</b> <b>connection.</b> This vulnerability arises due to incompatibilities between the floor system and intrinsic deformations of the neighbouring seismic frames. In a previous contribution by the authors (Jensen et al 2006), a conceptual retrofit strategy for existing hollowcore seating connections was proposed. This paper provides an experimental validation of that strategy through quasi-static cyclic testing of alternative seating connection configurations, adopting varying seating lengths. In general, unfavourable performance was exhibited by the existing seating connections, resulting in loss of vertical support of the hollowcore unit. In contrast, when additional seating and selective weakening retrofit approaches were implemented, a higher level of seismic performance leading to collapse prevention was achieved. In conclusion, issues and uncertainties associated with the evaluation of the likely failure mechanism, as well as the definition of an appropriate retrofit intervention are discussed. ...|$|E

To be a common failure mode, connection damage or lap joint damage is chosen as damage signature in a structure, consisting of a flexible aluminum beam jointed on a frame by bolts. To simulate connection damage, the stress relaxing on the bolt is achieved by the action of bolt looseness quantified by rotation angle. The dynamic response of flexible beam system is monitored with a piezoelectric transducer. To produce exciting signal, an electro-mechanical system processes the voltage signal.

40|$|The use of precast element {{enables the}} {{possibility}} of developing and simplifying the construction and facilitates {{the introduction of new}} technological methods. The usage of precast concrete began about 70 years ago. Till now the technology has maintained its status in the construction industry as “The Least Understood form of Construction”.

In the competition between precast and monolithic structures, prefabrication gains an ever increasing prominence because it is accompanied by the improvement of quality, while the requirement in materials, working time and cost shows a decreased tendency.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive investigation on local web buckling mechanism {{and design of}} double-coped <b>beam</b> <b>connections.</b> Following a careful validation study, a series of finite element (FE) models are established, covering a spectrum of geometric and material variables including cope length, cope depth, web slenderness, and steel grade. The study reveals that the main failure mode of the models is either inelastic or elastic local web buckling, and the considered parameters can evidently influence the buckling capacity. The models with short copes tend to fail by inelastic buckling accompanied by excessive shear yielding. For the models with long copes, especially for those with thin webs and high steel grades, stable post-buckling equilibrium path could be sustained after the occurrence of initial buckling, {{and as a result}} the ultimate reaction can be evidently higher than that governed by elastic buckling. In addition, stress concentration is significant near the cope corners, and the peak elastic stress concentration factor (SCF) could achieve around 2. 0. A further discussion is made on various support and boundary conditions, and these variables are also shown to have clear influences on the local web buckling capacity of double-coped beams. Based on the numerical results, and recognising the potential limitations of the existing design rule, a modified design method, taking account of the various influential factors revealed in this study, is finally proposed. The available experimental and numerical results show that the modified method can effectively improve the accuracy of local web buckling design for double-coped <b>beam</b> <b>connections.</b> Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R
