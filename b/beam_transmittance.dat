40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA detailed oceanographic {{survey of the}} coastal waters between Monterey Bay and San Francisco Bay, California, was conducted from 10 through 18 May 1969. Measurements of <b>beam</b> <b>transmittance,</b> sound velocity, temperature, and particulate count were obtained. Over 500 water samples were taken for particulate analysis. The optical properties of this region {{were found to be}} very complex. The waters appeared to be affected by flow from San Francisco Bay, littoral material, upwelling, and possibly sewage outfalls during the survey. A greater volume of water with low transmissivity and high particle count existed in the northern region of the survey area than in the southern region. An eddy system between Monterey Bay and Point Ano Nuevo was suggested. Approximately 90 percent of the particles affecting <b>beam</b> <b>transmittance</b> were less than 12 y in diameter.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedEighty-six oceanographic stations were occupied {{in the waters}} between Monterey Bay and San Francisco Bay during the period 7 - 14 November 1969. Values of <b>beam</b> <b>transmittance,</b> oxygen content, particulate count, and temperature {{were obtained from the}} surface to 100 meters. These parameters were analyzed and compared by means of depth profiles, horizontal contours and vertical contours. The average sea surface temperature during this period was 14. 44 degrees C. The northern part of Monterey Bay had the lowest values of <b>beam</b> <b>transmittance</b> and highest values of particulate count. The California Current appears to be flowing southward down the coast at depths above 60 meters and entering Monterey Bay where it sinks to a depth of at least 61 meters. Indications of downwelling are present off the coast between Pt. Ano Nuevo andSanta Cruz and this is attributed to the northward flowing Davidson Current impinging on the shore and sinking.

Several direct sun products, including spectral direct <b>beam</b> <b>transmittance,</b> aerosol optical depth, Ångström exponent and precipitable water, {{can be derived from}} these observations. The individual steps of the data analysis are described, and the different sources of uncertainty are discussed. The total uncertainty of the observed direct beam transmittances is estimated to be about 4  % for most channels within a 95  % confidence interval for shipborne operation. The calibration is identified as the dominating contribution to the total uncertainty. A comparison of direct <b>beam</b> <b>transmittance</b> with those obtained from a Cimel sunphotometer at a land site and a manually operated Microtops II sunphotometer on a ship is presented. Measurements deviate by less than 3 and 4  % on land and on ship, respectively, for most channels and in agreement with our previous uncertainty estimate. These numbers demonstrate that the instrument is well suited for shipborne operation, and the applied methods for motion correction work accurately. Based on spectral direct <b>beam</b> <b>transmittance,</b> aerosol optical depth can be retrieved with an uncertainty of 0. 02 for all channels within a 95  % confidence interval. The different methods to account for Rayleigh scattering and gas absorption in our scheme and in the Aerosol Robotic Network processing for Cimel sunphotometers lead to minor deviations.

40|$|SIO Reference 58 - 37. The {{problem of}} the {{measurement}} of the optical properties of a given medium {{is complicated by the}} fact that the act of measurement perturbs the distribution of radiant flux in the immediate vicinity of the measuring process. Consequently, the numbers derived from a measurement process do not faithfully reflect the inherent optical properties of the medium under study, but rather contain along with the information sought both the effects of the presence of the measuring apparatus and its characteristic response to radian-flux. The present note contains a general formulation of the equation of transfer for perturbed radiance field in an arbitrary optical medium. The resultant theory is applied to the {{problem of the}} measurement of the volume attenuation function o<  (or, equivalently, <b>beam</b> <b>transmittance)</b> in natural waters and the atmosphere. In particular, the theory leads to several new measuring techniques for o< which take into account the perturbation effect on the light field of the standard measuring apparatus used for the determination of o<.

The second one assumes that Alice's pool of possible coherent states to be teleported to Bob does not cover the whole complex plane. The optimal strategy is achieved by tuning three parameters in the original CVTP, namely, the <b>beam</b> splitter <b>transmittance</b> and the displacements in position and momentum implemented on the teleported state.

Allowing for arbitrary quantum states of both the input reference modes and the output reference modes on which the measurements are performed, the setup is described within the concept of two-port non-unitary transformation, and the overall non-unitary transformation operator is derived. It is shown to be a product of operators, where each operator is assigned to one of the beam splitters and can be expressed in terms of an s-ordered operator product, with s being determined by the <b>beam</b> splitter <b>transmittance</b> or reflectance.

40|$|Uniform {{intensity}} of laser radiation {{is very important}} in holographic and interferometry technologies, therefore transformation of typical Gaussian distribution of a TEM 00 laser to flat-top (top hat) is an actual technical task, it is solved by applying beam shaping optics. Holography and interferometry have specific requirements to a uniform laser beam, most important of them are flatness of phase front and extended depth of field. There are different refractive and diffractive beam shaping approaches used in laser industrial and scientific applications, but only few of them are capable to fulfil the optimum conditions for beam quality demanding holography and interferometry. We suggest applying refractive field mapping beam shapers piShaper, which operational principle presumes almost lossless transformation of Gaussian to flat-top beam with flatness of output wavefront, conserving of beam consistency, providing collimated low divergent output <b>beam,</b> high <b>transmittance,</b> extended depth of field, negligible wave aberration, and achromatic design provides capability to work with several lasers with different wavelengths simultaneously.

Motion was taken to occur tangentially to the interface(s) and in the plane of incidence. The moving materials were assumed to be isotropic, homogeneous, dissipative dielectric materials {{from the perspective of}} a co-moving observer. Two different moving materials were considered: {{from the perspective of a}} co-moving observer, material A supports planewave propagation with only positive phase velocity, whereas material B supports planewave propagation with both positive and negative phase velocity, depending on the polarization state. For both materials A and B, the sense of the phase velocity and whether or not counterposition occurred, as perceived by a nonco-moving observer, could be altered by varying the observer's velocity. Furthermore, the lateral position of a beam upon propagating through a uniformly moving slab made of material A, as perceived by a nonco-moving observer, could be controlled by varying the observer's velocity. In particular, at certain velocities, the transmitted beam emerged from the slab laterally displaced in the direction opposite to the direction of incident <b>beam.</b> The <b>transmittances</b> of a uniformly moving slab made of material B were very small and the energy density of the transmitted beam was largely concentrated in the direction normal to the slab, regardless of the observer's velocity...|$|R

40|$|Interactions between {{light and}} a {{molecule}} can result in reversible or irreversible changes in properties of both {{the light and the}} molecule. Of the many known interactions, nonlinear absorption is a process in which an intense light signal, for instance from a laser, can be moderated. This can be manifested either in a marked lowering of the light’s intensity or in reductions in fluctuations of its intensity. Such an effect is often termed ‘optical power limiting’ (OPL). High power lasers can be very dangerous since their high intensity can damage or destroy eyes and optical sensors. However, there are currently no adequate protective measures against lasers that cover the entire visible region and there is an increasing demand for new or improved OPL materials. Some of the most promising optical power limiting materials are substances that combine nonlinear optical properties with high transparency in normal light, but after activation by a laser <b>beam,</b> their light <b>transmittance</b> falls extremely rapidly via so-called self-activating mechanisms. The platinum(II) acetylides comprise one class of compounds with such properties. In this study, various OPL Pt(II) acetylides were synthesized and their nonlinear optical properties were characterized.

The electronic transition energies of this centre differ only slightly from the primary centre indicating it represents a slight perturbation of the environment surrounding the Erᶾ⁺ ion, perhaps due to clustering. Various dynamical effects resulting from excitation into the ⁴I₁₁/₂ multiplet have also been observed. After inital excitation, fluorescence from the sample is seen to sharply rise, then slowly (τ ∼ 0. 6 s) attenuate to a steady level. A simultaneous reduction in both laser <b>beam</b> <b>transmittance</b> and ground-state population have also been observed. A trigonal C₃ᵥ symmetry Hamiltonian was fitted to the experimental crystal-field energy levels from the optical spectroscopy work The standard deviation of the fitted energy-level scheme (with respect to those experimentally observed) improved significantly on previous work...|$|E
