25|$|Sometime between 10:15 and 11:15 pm, a drunk McGreavy became infuriated {{with the}} Ralph children, {{beginning}} with the baby, Samantha, who had <b>been</b> <b>crying</b> for her bottle. McGreavy violently killed Samantha {{and then the other}} two children, each in a different manner. Eight-month-old Samantha died from a fractured skull, 2-year-old Dawn had her throat slit and 4-year-old Paul was strangled. After killing the three children, McGreavy went down to the basement and retrieved a pickaxe. He further mutilated their bodies with the pickaxe before impaling the three bodies on the spikes of a wrought iron fence in a neighbour's yard. He then left the home.|$|E
500|$|Detectives {{noted that}} during her {{interview}} Green {{did not appear}} to be or have <b>been</b> <b>crying,</b> and her manner was [...] "talkative, even cheerful". She repeatedly referred to Tim and Kelly Farrar in the past tense, and referred to all of her children by their ages rather than their names. Her accounts of times from the previous evening varied, and she seemed uncertain what time she had done things like gone to bed.|$|E
500|$|Kate {{reported}} to police {{that when she}} called to her mother after escaping onto the garage roof, Green had been [...] "terribly upset" [...] and called to Kate to jump into her arms. Though Green missed catching her daughter when she did jump, Kate was not hurt. When the two ran into Farrar minutes later, Kate said that Farrar had been accusatory toward Green and Green had <b>been</b> <b>crying</b> and worried about her missing children.|$|E
6000|$|Sylvie <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> too by this time, and {{she said}} nothing but [...] "Bruno, dear!" [...] and [...] "I never was so happy before," [...] though why these two {{children}} {{who had never been}} so happy before should both <b>be</b> <b>crying</b> <b>was</b> a mystery to me.|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} between us, for I <b>was</b> <b>crying,</b> and I believe, at heart, he <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> too. At last he dropped my hand, {{and seemed to}} change back, by an effort, to his former calmness.|$|R
40|$|Bacillus thuringiensis is a ubiquitous, gram-positive and spore-forming bacterium. During sporulation, it {{produces}} intracellular crystal (<b>cry)</b> proteins, which <b>are</b> toxic to insects. The genetic diversity of B. thuringiensis strains shows regional differences. Thus, each habitat may contain novel strains with new insecticide. The {{aim of this}} study was to isolate B. thuringiensis strains from different environments of Mizoram, India, and to identify the cry gene content of the isolates using PCR. The universal primers specific to cry 1, cry 2, cry 3, cry 4 and <b>cry</b> 9 genes <b>were</b> used to detect the type of cry gene carried by each environmental isolate. Altogether, a total of 42 <b>cry</b> genes <b>were</b> detected out of which 12 <b>were</b> <b>cry</b> 1, 5 <b>were</b> <b>cry</b> 2, 3 <b>were</b> <b>cry</b> 3, 18 <b>were</b> <b>cry</b> 4 and 22 <b>were</b> <b>cry</b> 9 out of 45 selected strains. Key words: Bacillus thuringiensis; cry; PCR; insecticidal prediction...|$|R
500|$|At dinner, Brian {{attempts}} to make small talk, but Quagmire does not soften up. Finally, Brian asks Quagmire why he does not like him. Quagmire responds with an angry tirade detailing everything about Brian he finds reprehensible, {{at the end of}} which he calls Brian [...] "a big, sad, alcoholic bore". Brian then returns home, having <b>been</b> <b>crying</b> on the way back. Stewie cheers him up by saying that he only needs to like himself, and then professes his own admiration for Brian by letting him spend the night in his room.|$|E
500|$|... "Resentment" [...] is {{a passionate}} ballad about a gritty, {{agitated}} goodbye which adds a [...] "different kind of overwrought drama". The track {{is written in}} the key of E major. [...] "Resentment" [...] features a slow groove of 70 beats per minute, with Beyoncé's vocals range spanning from the note of F3 to E5. It is built around a honeyed sample from Curtis Mayfield's [...] (1972) album: [...] "How could you lie?". In [...] "Resentment" [...] Beyoncé sings about infidelity and a boyfriend who cheats and lies to her, seen in the lines [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>crying</b> for too long/ What {{did you do to}} me?/ You lied, you lied, you lied." [...] In the song, Beyoncé presents a more vulnerable side of herself, because she shows that she doesn't want her boyfriend to leave her for another woman.|$|E
500|$|A {{pre-season}} injury {{kept him}} out of the entire 1980–81 season, during which time he coached the reserves. In this time he converted Steve Bould from a striker into a centre-back. Smith returned from injury in 1981–82, and featured regularly early in the season, and by the time another injury forced him out of the team, Stoke were sitting in 18th-place. He joined York City, who were struggling in the Fourth Division, on a one-month loan in March 1982. He debuted in a 3–1 home defeat to Hull City on 16 March 1982, and scored once for York, in a 4–2 loss away to Wigan Athletic on 2 April. Smith made seven appearances while on loan at York, and exerted his influence on the team by organising the defence; he commented that [...] "They had <b>been</b> <b>crying</b> out for an older head like me". He was recalled by Stoke manager Richie Barker as the defence struggled in his absence, and Smith re-established himself in the team as they avoided relegation. He was handed a free transfer to York in May 1982. He said that if he had been offered a coaching role at Stoke he would have stayed, but that Barker wanted him gone as he saw him as a threat to his position. In total, Smith made 493 appearances for Stoke, a club record for a centre-back.|$|E

500|$|Naomi and Emily {{escape to}} the {{countryside}} later that evening and cycle to one of Emily's favourite places by a lake before sunset. After swimming in the lake, they light a campfire, and share a cannabis joint. An act of blowbacking the joint leads the two to share a kiss and they proceed to make love. Emily wakes up the following morning to find Naomi preparing to leave. She pleads with Naomi not to leave her a second time and tells her that she should accept {{that she needs to}} be loved. Naomi goes home to find Kieran in bed with her mother, and leaves for college, devastated. She sees her teachers rigging the election to prevent Cook from winning, and reveals this to the form when she is announced the winner. As his first presidential act, Cook starts a riot. In the ensuing chaos, Naomi forgives Kieran, encouraging him that if he likes her mother, he should tell her so. Naomi begins to have sex with Cook before she realises that it [...] "isn't right". Surprisingly, Cook doesn't seem to mind, as he says that she must have a good reason not to follow through because she's clever. Naomi leaves, with her and Cook now sharing a better understanding of each other. That night, she visits Emily's house, but Emily refuses to open the door, not wanting Naomi to see her after she had <b>been</b> <b>crying.</b> They sit {{on opposite sides of the}} door, and Naomi admits that she does need somebody to love her. Emily offers her hand through the door's cat flap to Naomi, who finally reciprocates Emily's feelings.|$|E
2500|$|After 323 {{appearances}} and exactly 100 goals, Keegan left Liverpool as promised. He {{had been made}} offers from clubs across Europe, and chose to join Hamburger SV in the West German Bundesliga for £500,000. Liverpool replaced him with Kenny Dalglish. Of his time in Liverpool, Keegan later said, [...] "The only thing I fear is missing an open goal {{in front of the}} Kop. I would die if that were to happen. When they start singing 'You'll Never Walk Alone' my eyes start to water. There have been times when I've actually <b>been</b> <b>crying</b> while I've been playing." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the second}} day, Ian Bell {{became the first}} Englishman to score 100 before lunch in a Test match for 70 years, the last one being [...] Les Ames, as both Bell and Thorpe hit out ahead of the {{predicted}} lunchtime declaration, which happened with England on 447 for 3. What followed was what the series had <b>been</b> <b>crying</b> out for earlier: a spirited Bangladeshi performance with proper cricketing shots. Whilst some Bangladeshis did get out to wild shots, the senior players got behind the ball, selected which ball to play, and {{made the most of}} the aggressive field placings chosen by England to make partnerships and build innings.|$|E

5000|$|About the Christmas {{scene in}} Scandal, when {{several of the}} {{characters}} go to a tavern and sing Auld Lang Syne (in Japanese) together, Donald Richie writes, [...] "… soon all the whores <b>are</b> <b>crying,</b> the band <b>is</b> <b>crying,</b> the drunks <b>are</b> <b>crying,</b> all roaring out the lyrics. The horror of the situation (for this is plainly the genesis of the harrowing night-town sequence of Ikiru) does not occur to the director. Rather, these are good and simple people and this is their moment of truth." ...|$|R

2500|$|Gordon Smart, the show-business editor from The Sun, {{said that}} Dyer was a [...] "brilliant signing for EastEnders—they are a match in soap heaven", {{saying it was}} [...] "about time" [...] that the show brought in some [...] "fresh blood". He said, [...] "It has {{been a while since}} the {{struggling}} Albert Square show had a character with presence beyond The Queen Vic and Danny is just the man for the job." [...] He added that Dyer's good acting skills and [...] "bags of character" [...] would give EastEnders [...] "the geezer it's <b>been</b> <b>crying</b> out for." [...] However, the newspaper's television critic, Ally Ross, said that EastEnders had reached a [...] "dead end" [...] recently and their solution was to bring in Dyer: [...] "one of those slap-the-forehead appointments that instantly has you wondering, 'which one of them is slumming it?' General consensus seemed to believe it was EastEnders—though given the show's ratings and endless comings and goings, I'd actually argue it's [...] Dyer who could do a lot better here." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shahrukh Khan reacted by saying: [...] "To {{live with}} {{intention}} {{and walk to}} the edge. Play with abandon, choose with no regret. Smile and made us do the same. Sir, you defined our era. Whenever life felt tough you made us feel how love could change it all. RIP." [...] Mumtaz also added that she had memories of having workied with him {{and said that she}} had <b>been</b> <b>crying</b> the whole morning, but was happy that she had met the ailing Khanna in Mumbai in June 2012, when the two discussed their respective battles with cancer. While Shahid Kapoor quoted: [...] "RIP to the 1st king of romance... Rajesh Khanna." [...] Subhash Ghai added that Khanna [...] "was the powerhouse of the Hindi film industry. I met him on the set of Aradhna, he had some kind of energy and you will be charged when he is around you. His name will be written in golden words." [...] Amitabh Bachchan was quoted as saying: [...] "The word 'superstar' was invented for him, and for me it shall ever remain his, and no others [...]. !! His generation and the generations that follow, shall never be able to describe, or understand his phenomena [...]. !!". His son-in-law Akshay Kumar told reporters about his death and added that [...] "he has gone to a nice and heavenly place. I am happy that he has gone there and hope that everyone will pray for him." ...|$|E
