40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the nature of the {{reactions}} of n-propyl and <b>benzyl</b> <b>chloroformates</b> with tetra-n-butylammonium nitrate in actonitrile as a reaction medium. A thermodynamic investigation associated with the enthalpy of formation and vaporization of these chloroformates has also been undertaken. The reaction kinetics were determined at various concentrations of chloroformates and tetra-n-butyl-ammonium nitrate at different temperatures. The reactions have been found to be second-order and to follow pseudo-first-order rate coefficients proportional to the nitrate ion concentration. The changes in entropies, deltaS +/-, ranged from - 59. 5 for n-C 3 H 7 OCOCl to - 14. 5 J mol- 1 deg- 1 for C 6 H 5 CH 2 OCOCl, which indicates that the reaction proceeded by a bimolecular SN 2 mechanism. The studies give evidence that the rate-determining step is the initial reaction between the chloroformates and NO- 3 to give nitratocarbonate via a tetrahedral intermediate. The expected products, nitrate ester and carbon dioxide, are obtained in maximum yields of 18 - 20 % and 61 % respectively. Addition of pyridine or tetra-n-butylammonium perchlorate, has little effect on the yield of nitrate ester product. The tetra-n-butylammonium chloride product is more reactive towards both n-propyl and <b>benzyl</b> <b>chloroformates</b> than the corresponding nitrate. The enthalpies of solution of n-propyl and <b>benzyl</b> <b>chloroformates</b> in sodium hydroxide (1 mol dm - 3) have been measured over a range of concentrations at 298. 15 K, using a solution reaction calorimeter. The variation with the concentration of the enthalpy of hydrolysis was not significant over the concentration ranges studied deltaHthetaf (C 3 H 7 OCOCl, 1) = - 524. 396 +/- 0. 767 kj mol- 1 for 5791 <n < 19593 and deltaHtheta(C 6 H 5 CH 2 OCOCl, 1) = - 375. 244 +/- 1. 088 kJ mol- 1 for 36804 < n < 52495. Enthalpies of vaporization have been obtained from measurements of vapour pressure over the temperature range 293. 13 to 306. 30 K, deltaHthetav (n-C 3 H 7 OCOCl, 298. 15 K) = 40. 676 +/- 0. 450, and 293. 770 to 302. 34 K, deltaHthetav (C 6 H 5 CH 2 OCOC 1, 298. 15 K) = 38. 527 +/- 0. 1 10 Kj mol - 1. Enthalpies of vaporization were also obtained using a vaporization calorimeter, giving deltaHthetav (n-C 3 H 7 OCOCl, 298. 15 K) = 40. 742 + 0. 403 kj mol - 1. These values of deltaHthetav, obtained from the vapour pressure measurements, are combined with the enthalpies of formation of deltaHthetaf (1) values to give enthalpies of formation in the gaseous state at 298. 15 K viz., deltaHthetaf (n-C 3 H 7 OCOCl, g) = - 483. 720 +/- 0. 864 kj mol deltaHthetaf (C 6 H 5 CH 2 OCOCl, g) = - 336. 717 + 1. 094 kJ mol<p...|$|R

Several enzymes in this class are very important targets {{for the development of}} specific and potent inhibitors. The synthesis of new α-branched α-amino acids as potential mechanism-based inhibitors is described. ^ A new synthetic approach to the formal α-vinylation of α-amino acids was developed. Commercially available ethylene oxide serves as the vinyl cation equivalent. Alkylation followed by in situ lactonization occurs. A new reagent for the chemoselective cleavage of α-substituted homoserine lactones was discovered. Reduction of diphenyl diselenide with sodium trimethoxyborohydride generates a phenylselenolate anion equivalent which efficiently cleaves the α-substituted homoserine lactones without competing lactone reduction. The free α-vinyl amino acids were obtained after selenide oxidation, selenoxide pyrolysis and acid hydrolysis. ^ A method for the simultaneous amino group protection (Cbz) and carboxyl group esterification for α-amino acids is reported. Heating of an amino acid with excess <b>benzyl</b> <b>chloroformate</b> in the presence of triethylamine and dimethylaminopyridine in DMSO, produces the corresponding N-Cbz amino acid benzyl ester in good yield. ^ Analogues of α-amino acids in which the α-proton has been replaced by an unsubstituted oxirane ring have been synthesized for the first time. Hydrogenolytically cleavable protecting groups are employed. The oxirane is installed via a direct or indirect epoxidation method. Diastereomerically homogeneous erythro and threo α-oxiranyl amino acids are accessible using these procedures.
