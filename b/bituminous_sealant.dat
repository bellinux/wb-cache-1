40|$|Crack sealing is {{a common}} {{pavement}} maintenance treatment because it extends pavement service life. However, crack sealant often fails prematurely due {{to a loss of}} adhesion. Since current test methods are mostly empirical and only provide a qualitative measure of bond strength, they cannot predict sealant adhesive failure accurately. Hence, there is an urgent need for test methods based on <b>bituminous</b> <b>sealant</b> rheology that can better predict sealant field performance. This study introduces three laboratory tests aimed to assess the bond property of hot-poured crack sealant to pavement crack walls. The three tests are designed to serve the respective needs of producers, engineers, and researchers. The first test implements the principle of surface energy to measure the thermodynamic work of adhesion, which is the energy spent in separating the two materials at the interface. The work of adhesion is reported as a measure of material compatibility at an interface. The second test is a direct adhesion test, a mechanical test which is designed to closely resemble both the installation process and the crack expansion due to thermal loading. This test uses the Direct Tension Test (DTT) device. The principle of the test is to apply a tensile force to detach the sealant from its aggregate counterpart. The maximum load, Pmax, and the energy to separation, E, are calculated and reported to indicate interface bonding. The third test implements the principles of fracture mechanics in a pressurized circular blister test. The apparatus is specifically designed to conduct the test for bituminous crack sealant, asphalt binder, or other bitumenbased materials. In this test, a fluid is injected at a constant rate at the interface between the substrate (aggregate or a standard material) and the adhesive (crack sealant) to create a blister. The fluid pressure and blister height are measured as functions of time; the data is used to calculate Interfacial Fracture Energy (IFE), which is a fundamental property {{that can be used to}} predict adhesion. The stable interface debonding process makes this test attractive. This test also may be used to estimate the optimum annealing time, and to quantify other interface characteristics, such as the moisture susceptibility of a bond. In addition, the elastic modulus of the sealant and its residual stresses can be determined analytically. While the direct adhesion test is proposed as part of newly developed performance-based guidelines for the selection of hot-poured crack sealant, the blister test may be used to estimate the optimum annealing time, in addition to IFE determination.

40|$|Environmental {{and health}} aspects of road {{materials}} {{have been discussed}} for a long time, mostly regarding bitumen and bitumen fumes. However, just a few studies on other types of road materials have been reported. In this doctoral study, two types of materials, asphalt release agents and <b>bituminous</b> <b>sealants,</b> were investigated with regard to chemical characterization and emission profiles. Besides conventional test methods, solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique was applied for emissions profiles screening and quantitative analysis. General description of main characteristics of asphalt release agents and <b>bituminous</b> <b>sealants</b> is given, and a comprehensive state-of-the-art on SPME technique is presented, especially on methodologies for analyzing mono- and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs and PAHs) in different sample matrices. In the experimental study, chemical characterization of the two material types was performed using conventional methods, including {{fourier transform infrared spectroscopy}} - attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), mass spectrometry (MS) and gas chromatography â€“ mass spectrometry (GC-MS). General patterns regarding functional groups and molecular weight distribution were studied. In the case of asphalt release agents, more detailed information on chemical compositions, especially the contents of MAHs and PAHs, was obtained. General information on emission proneness of asphalt release agents was obtained using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and MS. Using headspace(HS) -SPME and GC-MS, emission profiles of asphalt release agents were characterized at different temperatures, whereas the profiles of <b>bituminous</b> <b>sealants</b> were obtained solely at room temperature. The results presented were used for ranking the materials with regard to degree of total emission as well as emission of hazardous substances. The applicability of HS-SPME for quantitative analysis of MAHs in asphalt release agents and emulsion-based <b>bituminous</b> <b>sealants</b> was investigated. The use of a surrogate sample matrix was concerned, and experimental parameters influencing the HS-SPME procedure, such as equilibration and extraction time, as well as effects of sample amount and matrices, were studied. The methods were evaluated with regard to detection limit, accuracy as well as precision. Different calibration approaches including external calibration, internal calibration and standard addition were investigated. The determination of MAHs in asphalt release agents and emulsion-based <b>bituminous</b> <b>sealants</b> using HS-SPME-GC-MS was conducted. QC 2010091...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} three {{laboratory tests}} {{for evaluating the}} interfacial bonding of <b>bituminous</b> <b>sealants</b> to pavements.

40|$|Problem statement: The {{performance}} of <b>bituminous</b> <b>sealants</b> {{in the field}} is partly&# 13; controlled by properties and strength of the sealant-aggregate interface. The thermodynamic work of&# 13; adhesion represents energy required for reversible separation of the two materials at the interface. The&# 13; study of fracture includes the energy required for both reversible and irreversible processes during&# 13; separation. Excess of work of facture over work of adhesion represents the energy consumed by&# 13; irreversible processes in the specimen during loading and fracture. In addition, adhesion strength is&# 13; related to the properties of constitutive components. Approach: The objective of this study was to&# 13; measure or predict adhesion of hot-poured bituminous-based sealant to aggregates of different&# 13; chemical composition. In order to accomplish, the study of fracture and the thermodynamic work of&# 13; adhesion were estimated for 14 hot-poured bituminous-based sealants with two types of aggregate:&# 13; Limestone and quartzite. The work of adhesion for each sealant-aggregate system was calculated from&# 13; the contact angle measurements of system components at corresponding sealant installation&# 13; temperature. Results: In general, limestone showed better adhesion to hot-poured crack sealant than&# 13; quartzite. Interfacial parameters such as contact angles and surface tensions were successfully used to&# 13; differentiate between sealants. Conclusion/Recommendation: The findings were in agreement with&# 13; preliminary testing results of 14 sealants using a newly developed fixture in the direct-tension testing&# 13; machine. Provided the sealant has an appropriate viscosity to fill the crack, as the sealant surface&# 13; tension decreases, its adhesion strength increases...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{adhesion}} {{theories and}} associated mechanisms are reviewed {{and applied to}} <b>bituminous</b> crack <b>sealants</b> and to the crack sealing of asphalt concrete (AC) roadways. As such, the possible contribution of each mechanism to the sealant-interface-AC system is critically assessed. Of six possible adhesion mechanisms, only sealant adsorption and interlock can explain adhesion between sealant and AC. In this regard, intrinsic sealant properties such as viscosity and composition are particularly important. In contrast, sealant failure can be explained best {{by the presence of}} defects at the sealant-AC interface such as dust, voids and microcracks. The existence of these defects is more closely related to sealant installation than to the sealant itself. In the end, the review allows for the identification of many factors that must be better understood if sealant adhesion and performance is to be enhanced significantly...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bituminous</b> crack <b>sealants</b> {{are used}} to seal cracks and joints in pavements. In Canada and in regions {{experiencing}} harsh climates, sealants often fail prematurely, however. This is, in part, because {{it is difficult to}} select the best sealants, those that can withstand demanding conditions, based on the existing ASTM D 3405 specification. Consequently, users {{would like to have a}} performance-based specification that allows for selecting appropriate sealants. The aim of this paper is to serve as a building block in the development of such a specification. For that purpose, sealant failures, field performance in cold climates, standard test results, sealant aging, rheology and adhesion are reviewed. From this exercise, it is anticipated that a performance-based specification would contain a rheological or thermal test that is indicative of the sealant performance in the spectrum of service temperatures; adhesion, viscosity, and solubility tests; and two aging tests, one that simulates installation, the other, weathering in service...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bituminous</b> crack <b>sealants</b> were {{analyzed}} by viscometry, fluorescence microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, modulated differential scanning calorimetry and low temperature tensile testing. The results indicate that sealants are blends of bitumen, oil, copolymer and filler. Upon blending, these components produce a three phase system that consists of a polymer-modified bitumen (PMB) matrix, a filler, and a filler-PMB interface. Spectroscopy and microscopy indicate that the PMB phase is rich in styrene-butadiene type copolymer, that the filler is recycled rubber, sometimes mixed with calcium carbonate, and that the interface depends on the filler and the oil content in the sealant. The physico-chemical methods were used to predict the short- and medium-term performance of sealant mixtures. The short-term performance predicted from viscometry and microscopy correlated well with the 1 -year field performance of the sealants. Sealants showed two glass transition temperatures (Tg's), and a reasonable correlation was also found between the low temperature Tg and medium-term performance in a wetfreeze climate. However, because Tg measurements do not account for stress relaxation and aging effects, correlation was not perfect...|$|R
40|$|Twelve <b>bituminous</b> hot-pour crack <b>sealants</b> were {{evaluated}} {{over four years}} in temperatures ranging from [...] 40 C to + 40 C. Each sealant was evaluated over 900 linear meters of transverse and longitudinal routs of 12 (width depth). Results show that sealant source, rout size, and rout orientation affected sealant performance, i. e., debonding and pull-out levels. Debonding levels were 0 [...] 50 % and pull-out levels 0 [...] 30 %. Sealant failure was proportional to rout width; it was lowest in 12 mm wide routs and highest in 40 mm wide routs. This result is attributed to the proportional exposure of sealants to slow moving traffic. The increase of sealant failure over time was also found to be nonlinear. Three stages were identified in the failure [...] time plot. In stage 1, failure is rapid; in stage 2, it plateaus; and in stage 3, it increases again. Failure in stage 1 {{is thought to be}} related mainly to a weak sealant [...] asphalt concrete interface, whereas that in stage 3 is thought to be related to sealant weathering and stiffening. It was also found that standard test results correlate poorly with field performance...|$|R
