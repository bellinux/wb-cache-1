5|$|Although Poedjangga Baroe {{writers were}} united by nationalism, they had {{different}} views on traditional culture. Some, such as Armijn and Alisjahbana, considered {{an understanding of}} Western culture and history key to development. Others, such Sanusi, emphasized the need for Eastern values, though they accepted some aspects of Western culture. Writers for Poedjangga Baroe did not share religious views. Main contributors, including the founders, came from religious backgrounds ranging from near-secularism to orthodox Islam. Stemming from these conflicting cultural views, between September 1935 and June 1939, numerous polemics {{were published in the}} magazine, discussing the <b>best</b> <b>course</b> of action for Indonesian cultural development.|$|E
5|$|In 1842 {{the leaders}} of the Society of Friends, the Quaker group to which Coffin belonged, advised their members to cease {{membership}} in abolitionist societies and end activities assisting runaway slaves. The leaders insisted that legal emancipation was the <b>best</b> <b>course</b> of action. Coffin continued to {{take an active role in}} assisting escaping slaves and the following year the Quaker society expelled him from membership. Coffin and other Quakers who supported his activities separated and formed the Antislavery Friends; the two rival groups remained separate until a reunification occurred in 1851.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Soult {{was making}} his own plans. He knew that Blake {{intended}} to join forces with Beresford, but {{he thought that the}} Spanish divisions were still several days march away. Based on that erroneous premise, Soult decided that his <b>best</b> <b>course</b> of action would be to turn the Allies' southern flank, thus driving a wedge between the two parts of Beresford's army. Soult hoped that as a result he could defeat his opponents in detail, overcoming Beresford's force and then turning south to deal with Blake's divisions.|$|E

5|$|Modeste {{was clearly}} {{visible in the}} harbour, {{anchored}} at the mole near two tartanes (small Mediterranean sailing craft here armed with four guns and carrying crews of around 70 men). The senior officers of the squadron held a council to determine the <b>best</b> <b>course</b> of action, and decided that since diplomatic options had failed and the Genoese appeared to support the French, the British would resort to a military solution. On the afternoon of 5 October Bedford was slowly warped into the harbour and alongside Modeste, as Reeve launched the ship's boats from Captain and brought them close {{to the other side}} of the French frigate.|$|E
5|$|Baćović joined Đurišić's {{forces in}} their trek towards Slovenia, {{alongside}} Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić, detachments commanded by Ostojić, {{and a large}} number of refugees, totaling around 10,000. This force was formed into the Chetnik 8th Montenegrin Army, consisting of the 1st, 5th, 8th and 9th (Herzegovina) divisions. Earlier, Đurišić and Mihailović had argued over the <b>best</b> <b>course</b> of action. Đurišić had wanted to withdraw through Albania to Greece, but Mihailović had told him to prepare for an Allied landing, the return of the king and the establishment of a national government. From the time Đurišić joined Mihailović in northeastern Bosnia, he was very critical of Mihailović's leadership and argued strongly for all remaining Chetnik troops to move to Slovenia. When Mihailović remained unconvinced, Đurišić decided to move to Slovenia independently of him, and arranged for Dimitrije Ljotić's Serbian Volunteer Corps already in Slovenia to meet him near Bihać in western Bosnia to assist his movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{task force}} then sailed around Euboea {{to the first}} major target, Eretria. According to Herodotus, the Eretrians were divided amongst {{themselves}} as to the <b>best</b> <b>course</b> of action; whether to flee to the highlands, or undergo a siege, or {{to submit to the}} Persians. In the event, the majority decision was to remain in the city. The Eretrians made no attempt to stop the Persians landing, or advancing, and thus allowed themselves to be besieged. For six days the Persians attacked the walls, with losses on both sides; however, on the seventh day two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed the city to the Persians. The city was razed, and temples and shrines were looted and burned. Furthermore, according to Darius's commands, the Persians enslaved all the remaining townspeople.|$|E

5|$|On 22 August, at 2:40 pm, Pym led {{an attack}} on Duperré's {{squadron}} without waiting for Iphigenia and Magicienne, entering the channel {{that led to the}} anchorage at Grand Port. He was followed by Nereide, but Willoughby had refused to allow Pym to embark the harbour pilot: {{the only person in the}} British squadron who knew the passage through the reefs. Without guidance by an experienced pilot, Sirius was aground within minutes and could not be brought off until 8:30 am on 23 August. Nereide anchored nearby during the night to protect the flagship. At 10:00 am, Iphigenia and Magicienne arrived and at 2:40 pm, after a conference between the captains as to the <b>best</b> <b>course</b> of action, the force again attempted to negotiate the channel. Although the squadron was now guided by Nereides pilot, Sirius again grounded at 3:00 pm and Magicienne 15 minutes later after over-correcting to avoid the reef that Sirius had struck. Nereide and Iphigenia continued the attack, Iphigenia engaging Minerve and Ceylon at close range and Nereide attacking Bellone. Long-range fire from Magicienne was also directed at Victor, which was firing on Nereide.|$|E
5|$|On 27 April Model {{met with}} Hitler {{to review and}} express his concern for {{reconnaissance}} information which showed the Red Army constructing very strong positions at {{the shoulders of the}} salient and having withdrawn their mobile forces from the area west of Kursk. He argued that the longer the preparation phase continued, the less the operation could be justified. He recommended completely abandoning Citadel, allowing the army to await and defeat the coming Soviet offensive, or radically revising the plan for Citadel. Though in mid-April Manstein had considered the Citadel offensive profitable, by May he shared Model's misgivings. He asserted that the <b>best</b> <b>course</b> of action would be for the German forces to take the strategic defensive, ceding ground to allow the anticipated Soviet forces to extend themselves and allow the German panzer forces to counterattack in the type of fluid mobile battle at which they excelled. Convinced that the Red Army would deliver its main effort against Army Group South, he proposed to keep the left wing of the army group strong while moving the right wing back in stages to the Dnieper River, followed by a counterattack against the flank of the Red Army advance. The counteroffensive would continue until the Sea of Azov was reached and the Soviet forces were cut off. Hitler rejected this idea; {{he did not want to}} give up so much terrain, even temporarily.|$|E

5|$|On April 4, 1968, African-American {{civil rights}} leader Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated by a sniper in Memphis, Tennessee. United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy was {{traveling}} to Indianapolis to promote his presidential campaign {{when he heard the}} news. He delivered a brief, improvised speech on the matter before suspending all of his campaign activities and withdrawing to his room at the Marott Hotel. After several phone conversations with black community leaders, he decided to speak out against the violent backlash to the assassination and carry on with a scheduled appearance before the City Club of Cleveland. His aides concurred that this was the <b>best</b> <b>course</b> of action, and agreed that he should shortly thereafter go to Washington D.C. and remain there until King could be buried. Kennedy also spoke over the phone with Coretta Scott King, King's widow, in Atlanta. At her request, Kennedy directed aide Frank Mankiewicz to arrange for a plane to retrieve King's body. Since most air carriers were wary of taking up such a task, a plane was chartered from one of Kennedy's friends. John Lewis and Earl Graves, among others, were dispatched to assist Coretta Scott King. Kennedy also had three additional phone lines installed at the King residence to handle the influx of incoming calls while his staff established a phone bank at West Hunter Baptist Church in Atlanta for the King family's use.|$|E
5|$|Once his {{squadron}} {{arrived in}} Tripoli, Silvori sent the Tritone {{into the harbor}} under a flag of truce in order to begin negotiations with Karamanli's government. With assurances from the resident British consul {{that they would be}} safe, Silvori went ashore on the 26th and met the Tripolitanian envoy, General Haggi Mohammed. Although negotiations at first seemed to be going well, the next day Karamanli sent a note with suggested terms that essentially abrogated the peace treaty that British Admiral Edward Pellew had negotiated on Sardinia's behalf after the Bombardment of Algiers in 1816. Seeing that Karamanli had no intention of offering acceptable terms, Sivori decided his <b>best</b> <b>course</b> of action would be to attack Tripoli. Before returning to his squadron Sivori managed to get the British consul to take under his protection what Sardinians remained in Tripoli. Salvori's force had a significant advantage over the Tripolitanian fleet, which only had a 12-gun brig and a pair of 6-gun schooners defending the harbor. Despite the disadvantage in naval power, Karamanli had significant forces ashore and several forts and shore batteries defending the harbor. Upon returning to his vessel, Salvori gave Karamanli a four-hour ultimatum that he would bombard the city unless better peace terms were offered by the Tripolitanians.|$|E
5|$|England {{maintained}} their newly confident approach, being on top {{for most of}} the fourth Test. Yardley's men scored 496 and achieved a first innings lead of 38, Yardley contributing two wickets. England increased their lead by 365 before Yardley declared. He kept the team batting for five minutes on the last day, allowing him to use the heavy roller to quicken the break-up of the pitch. Australia had to score 404 in 345 minutes, a target considered unlikely as such a large total had never been made to win a Test match. In addition, the pitch was difficult to bat on by now and the spinners could turn the ball sharply. However, England made several errors: Godfrey Evans, the England wicket-keeper had a bad day and missed some stumping chances; three catches were dropped by fielders, and England's only specialist spinner, Jim Laker, bowled poorly. Consequently, Yardley was forced to use Denis Compton's bowling. Compton was not a specialist bowler and although he caused problems for the batsmen, Bill Bowes believed the selectors were mistaken in expecting him to be as effective as a front line spinner. Yardley seemed unsure of the <b>best</b> <b>course</b> of action as Bradman and Arthur Morris added 301 runs for the second wicket; he resorted to using the very occasional leg spin of Hutton, who was hit for 30 runs in four overs, although Yardley himself dropped a catch from Hutton's bowling. The pitch conditions were unfavourable for the faster bowlers, but the ineffectiveness of the spinners forced Yardley to take the new ball. Australia won by seven wickets; the spectators were unhappy with the inadequate English bowling and the absence of a suitable bowler to exploit the pitch on the last day. Bowes later criticised Yardley for allowing Australia to score quickly enough to win; he believed that Yardley used Hutton's bowling to encourage the tourists to take risks against lesser bowling to keep up with required rate of scoring, but he miscalculated in using such bowling for too long. Wisden also stated that England should have won the match.|$|E

5|$|On 10 May, Germany invaded Belgium and the Netherlands. Army Group B, under Generaloberst Fedor von Bock, {{attacked}} into Belgium, {{while the}} three Panzer corps of Army Group A under Rundstedt swung {{around to the}} south and drove for the Channel. The BEF advanced from the Belgian border to positions along the River Dyle within Belgium, where they fought elements of Army Group B starting on 10 May. They were ordered to begin a fighting withdrawal to the Scheldt River on 14 May when the Belgian and French positions on their flanks failed to hold. During a visit to Paris on 17 May, Prime Minister Winston Churchill was astonished to learn from Gamelin that the French had committed all their troops to the ongoing engagements and had no strategic reserves. On 19 May, Gort met with French General Gaston Billotte, commander of the French First Army and overall coordinator of the Allied forces. Billotte revealed that the French had no troops between the Germans and the sea. Gort immediately saw that evacuation across the Channel was the <b>best</b> <b>course</b> of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest location with good port facilities. Surrounded by marshes, Dunkirk boasted old fortifications and the longest sand beach in Europe, where large groups could assemble. After continued engagements and a failed Allied attempt on 21 May at Arras to cut through the German spearhead, the BEF was trapped, along with the remains of the Belgian forces and the three French armies, in an area along the coast of northern France and Belgium.|$|E
