5|$|The zoo {{provides}} sanctuary to {{many animals}} that {{need a place}} to live for various reasons. Some (like the Arabian oryx, <b>Bali</b> <b>mynah,</b> rhinoceros hornbill, Mexican gray wolf, and white rhinoceros) participate in captive breeding programs, some (such as the African spotted dogs) have retired from such programs and need a home, some have behavioral problems, and some are being rehabilitated to return to the wild. Animals that are in sanctuary are treated somewhat differently from other animals by the zoo. While normal exhibits balance the needs of the animals with those of visitors (for example, incorporating large viewing areas), the sanctuary exhibits are almost completely focused on the comfort and well-being of the animals.|$|E
25|$|The zoo {{is highly}} {{proactive}} in species preservation and conservation efforts and participates in over 40 Species Survival Plans (SSP) with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.

25|$|The Owens Rain Forest Aviary {{contains}} about 200 tropical birds representing 45 species. Lories, kingfishers, <b>Bali</b> <b>mynahs,</b> jacanas, woodpeckers, and argus pheasants {{can all be}} seen here.|$|R
5000|$|McNeil Avian Center: An aviary {{finished}} in 2009 featuring {{many species of}} birds, mainly from Africa, the Pacific Islands, and South America. Some species include the extinct-in-the-wild Guam kingfisher and Guam rail and critically endangered <b>Bali</b> <b>mynahs.</b> Other birds include rhinoceros hornbills, Mariana fruit doves, Victoria crowned pigeons, and many others. There is also a 4-D Migration Theater {{telling the story of}} an Baltimore oriole named Otis and his migration.|$|R
50|$|The aviary {{contains}} over 60 {{species in}} a walk-through building. One section is a cage-less room where birds fly free. Species {{in the exhibit}} include the Caribbean flamingo, scarlet ibis, rhinoceros hornbill, <b>Bali</b> <b>mynah,</b> king vulture, rockhopper penguin, Gentoo penguin, the whooping crane and sunbittern, as well as various pigeons and herons.|$|E

Birds, such as scarlet macaw, <b>Bali</b> <b>mynah,</b> roseate spoonbill, and scarlet ibis, are free roaming, as well as Hoffman's two-toed sloth, and Indian Flying Fox. Individual exhibits house three-banded Armadillo, tortoises, and a small, deer-like species called greater mouse-deer.|$|E

50|$|The National Aviary {{also takes}} part in {{breeding}} {{programs designed to}} increase the numbers of endangered birds in captivity including the <b>Bali</b> <b>mynah</b> (nearly extinct in the wild), the Guam kingfisher, and the African penguin. Its first two African penguin chicks hatched in February 2012. On March 13, 2013, the aviary celebrated another success of its breeding program, when a female Eurasian owlet hatched, and within five days, doubled in size.|$|E
50|$|In {{its natural}} habitat it is inconspicuous, using tree tops for cover and-unlike other starlings-usually {{coming to the}} ground only to drink or to find nesting materials; {{this would seem to}} be an {{adaptation}} to its noticeability to predators when out in the open. The <b>Bali</b> <b>mynah</b> often gathers in groups when it is young to better locate food and watch out for predators. The vocalizations are a variety of sharp chattering calls and an emphatic twat.|$|E
50|$|The Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi), {{also known}} as Rothschild's mynah, Bali starling, or <b>Bali</b> <b>mynah,</b> locally known as jalak Bali, is a {{medium-sized}} (up to 25 cm long), stocky myna, almost wholly white with a long, drooping crest, and black tips on the wings and tail. The bird has blue bare skin around the eyes, greyish legs and a yellow bill. Both sexes are similar. It is critically endangered and fewer than 100 adults are assumed to currently exist in the wild.|$|E

50|$|One of the zoo's most {{historic}} buildings, the McCormick Bird House {{was first}} designed in 1904 under Cyrus DeVry, the zoo's original director. It has been re-designed multiple times, {{most recently in}} 1991, and is currently home to multiple habitats recreating the tropics, savanna, sea shore, desert, wetlands, and other biomes, with a tropical free-flight aviary allowing guests to become immersed with perching and aquatic birds without fences or glass. Some of the zoo's most notable birds include the famous laughing kookaburra in the scrub display, multiple scarlet ibis specimens in its swamp display, Guam rail, a rare bird which is extinct in the wild in its native Guam, and the <b>Bali</b> <b>mynah,</b> a critically endangeered bird that Lincoln Park Zoo breeds, while also maintaining the species' studbook. Thirty-one mynahs have been born at the zoo since 1972, with the most recent set of chicks being born in mid-2012.|$|E
50|$|The Tiger Trail {{has been}} home to many types of animals over the years; and recently, the area was renovated to center around the return of tigers to the Kansas City Zoo, and its native Asia. The entire trek is filled with oriental plants, lanterns, statues, and various {{pictures}} of Asian animals. The Francois langur is featured in the first enclosure. The path leads to a tunnel with <b>Bali</b> <b>mynah</b> and red panda. The langurs and the pandas swap exhibits according to outdoor conditions (pandas are outside in fall and winter, while in tunnel during spring and summer). The {{focal point of the}} Tiger Trail is the critically endangered Sumatran tiger exhibit, which is home to two male tigers. Other animals on exhibit are the, wreathed hornbill, demoiselle crane, and the tufted deer. Near the former ape house, Asian waterfowl, such as red-crowned crane, Mandarin duck, and common shelduck can be viewed in a wetlands exhibit.|$|E
