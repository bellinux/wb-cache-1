All four band members also felt weary of dealing with record companies and other associates. Despite this, the release wound up being a huge commercial success, particularly in the United States (sitting at the #1 slot on Billboards chart in just its second week on the chart).|$|E

500|$|Differing from Survivor in that {{previously}} Beyoncé {{had taken an}} active role in writing and producing, Destiny Fulfilled saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'. In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in Destiny Fulfilled, their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists. Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyoncé, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads—which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyoncé elaborated [...] "We {{wanted to make sure that}} the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance." [...] As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: [...] "All of us have been in three different places... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> separately into the new record." ...|$|E

Directed by debutant Sandeep Sawant, it was shot in 30 days at Sindhudurg, Konkan, Pune and at KEM Hospital in Mumbai. The post-production took one and half years to complete.

2500|$|Meanwhile, Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, {{headquartered}} in modern Changzhi, Shanxi) had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> much turmoil — as the officer Cheng Lin (成麟) {{had killed the}} military governor Gao Xun (高潯) in a mutiny in 881 and was in turn killed by another officer, Meng Fangli. [...] The people of Zhaoyi then asked the eunuch monitor Wu Quanxu (吳全勗) to act as military governor, but Meng rejected this (claiming that a eunuch {{should not be a}} governor) and put Wu under house arrest, instead claiming that he wanted the imperial government to send a replacement. [...] The imperial government commissioned Wang Hui to serve as Zhaoyi's military governor. [...] Wang, however, knowing that Meng had full control of three of Zhaoyi's five prefectures (i.e., the ones east of the Taihang Mountains), believed {{that he would not be}} actually able to exercise control, and so declined the commission. [...] The circuit was then instead given to Zheng Changtu, although Zheng left his post just three months later, leaving Meng in control.|$|E

2500|$|As commandant, Gardner took up {{residence}} with his family outside of {{the walls of the}} fort in a large house directly opposite the Western Postern-Gate. Living in the nearby community he could not take a very active or visible role giving aid to the fort fearing reprisal to his family and himself. On one occasion, when a secession meeting was taking place nearby, accompanied with threats and demonstrations, Gardner sent word to Doubleday to assume command of the fort at once in his place. [...] Although he was a Union officer, Gardner still held various southern sympathies and felt that the South had been treated unfairly in the question of territories and had been defrauded by the interests in the North. However, he acquiesced when it came to defending the forts in Charleston Harbor. During {{the months leading up to}} the Civil War Gardner, realizing that secessionist tensions were mounting, made several requests to President James Buchanan's Secretary of War, John B. Floyd, for troops to reinforce the garrison at Fort Moultrie on Sullivan's Island, but his requests were ignored. A southern sympathizer who was later indicted for conspiracy, Floyd had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> great lengths to put the forts at Charleston Harbor in the hands of the South Carolinians. Instead Floyd, aware that armed conflict was imminent, only sent a company of about 70 men, most of whom were southern sympathizers, [...] "for purposes of repairing, strengthening and making additions to the fort", the activity of which only rendered the fort much less defensible. The workers he sent to Moultrie were to be fed from existing provisions at the fort, which depended on Charleston for its supplies on a weekly basis. In the event of a siege the garrison could be starved out in a matter of days, as Floyd was planning for. Gardner had become suspicious of Floyd's planning and to avert any attempts to starve out the troops he wrote to an old friend, Colonel Joseph P. Taylor, in the commissary department, requesting provisions for one hundred men for six months and hinted that he could carry out the requisition in the normal line of duty without having to inform Floyd.|$|E
2500|$|Karan (Zain Khan) is a thirteen-year-old boy {{who lives}} in a {{dilapidated}} orphanage owned by a stern, uncouth warden, John [...] "Hitler" [...] Kakkad (Rajesh Khera). Karan has two dreams: one is to have parents and the other is to be a big Cricketer. His inspiration is Kapil Dev, since he has been brought up on the motivating stories of India's 1983 World Cup win by the orphanage caretaker, Bholu Dada (Sushil Parashar), a loving and a gentle old man. Karan's best friend in the orphanage is Daboo (Dieptiman Chowdhury) who often lends his gentle ears to the aspirations which Karan lives on. His dreams take a turn when one day, he lays his hands on an old cricket bat which Karan is convinced is the bat that Kapil Dev used to win the 1983 World Cup; for him, the bat becomes a magic bat. One day by a stroke of luck, the coach of the Indian cricket team spots Karan playing cricket and is highly impressed by his batting skill. At that point in town, the Indian cricket team has <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> a [...] "rough patch". Karan and his magical bat are inducted into the Indian cricket team as the opening batsman along with the captain, Varun (Rahul Bose). When Karan marches onto the pitch and wins the match for India, he soon becomes the nation's heartthrob. Although he was formerly rejected by adopting couples, he is now the most sought after kid in the country. However, Raghav (Raj Bhansali), the orphanage bully, hates him and feels that if Karan did not have the magic bat he would have never made it to the cricket team. Raghav now wants the magic bat at any cost. Karan and Varun develop a strong emotional bond deeper than fellow cricketers. Karan has no parents and Varun has parents, but is estranged with his father and does not want to accept him. Karan strongly believes that parents are the best gift endowed by God and succeeds in uniting Varun with his father. At the final 5th one day match between India and Pakistan, events spiral out of control and Karan's magic bat is destroyed by Raghav. Karan is a nervous wreck, but Varun makes him realise that the bat actually never had any magic but it was in the players viz. Kapil during 1983 World Cup and now Karan himself. With Karan's help, India wins the match. After the match, Karan decides to stop playing and re-join the team when he is older. Varun and his girlfriend, Malini (Meera Vasudevan) decide to adopt Karan.|$|E
