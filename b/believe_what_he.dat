5|$|The {{original}} ending {{was to have}} John killed, and {{his image}} kept alive by the resistance by grafting his skin onto Marcus' cybernetic body. Marcus would have then murdered Kate, Barnes, Kyle, and Star. However, after the ending was leaked on the Internet, Warner Bros. decided to completely change the entire third act of the film. McG and Nolan did continue the Christ element of John's character though, {{in which he has}} some followers who <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> knows about Skynet and others who do not.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the Syfy channel series Eureka, Boston Globe critic Matthew Gilbert {{compared}} the series to Psych, describing both as having [...] "light-hearted dramedic tones". A few days after the episode aired, Virginia Rohan of The Record called the show a [...] "promising series". Several critics compared the episode and show to the then-new Lifetime network series Angela's Eyes; in his article for the Los Angeles Daily News, journalist David Kronke stated that [...] "Lifetime's new crime drama 'Angela's Eyes' is essentially the USA Network's new series 'Psych' inside out and played without laughs". In an article for the Akron Beacon Journal, Angela's Eyes main character Abigail Spencer was compared to Shawn Spencer, who was described as being [...] "so good that people don't <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> can figure out". Psych was also described as having [...] "a much simpler premise", but being more entertaining than Angela's Eyes".|$|E
500|$|Earlier, Håkan {{stops and}} kills a passerby {{on a busy}} {{footpath}} near a main road to harvest fresh blood for Eli, but he fails to return with any when he is interrupted by an approaching dog walker. Eli is prompted to waylay and kill a local man, Jocke, making {{his way home from}} a bar after having said goodnight to his best friend, Lacke. A local cat-loving recluse, Gösta, witnesses the attack from his flat. He does not <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has seen and decides not to report the incident. Håkan hides Jocke's body in an ice-hole in the local lake. Håkan later makes another well-prepared but incompetently executed effort to obtain blood for Eli by trapping a teenage boy in a changing room after school. The boy's friends are waiting for him to emerge, and go to see what is holding him up. Before he is discovered, Håkan pours concentrated hydrochloric acid onto his own face, disfiguring it to prevent the authorities from identifying him and tracing Eli. Eli learns that Håkan has been taken to the hospital and scales the building to access his restricted room. Håkan opens the window for Eli and offers his neck to her for feeding; after she has fed, Håkan falls out of the window onto the snow and dies. Now alone, Eli goes to Oskar's apartment and spends the night with him, during which time they agree to [...] "go steady". While Eli states, [...] "I'm not a girl", Oskar (ambiguously) either ignores this or accepts the unclear nature of the relationship.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the sons}} of Israel (Jacob) {{returned}} to Hebron from their second trip, they came back with twenty additional donkeys carrying all kinds of goods and supplies as well as Egyptian transport wagons. When their father came out to meet them, his sons told him that Joseph was still alive, {{that he was the}} governor over all of Egypt and that he wanted the house of Israel to move to Egypt. Israel’s heart “stood still” and just couldn’t <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was hearing. Looking upon the wagons he declared “Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.” (...) ...|$|E
2500|$|Moyer {{cut short}} {{his visit to}} the strike zone to confer with Governor Woodbridge Nathan Ferris on September 3. Joining him was Clarence Darrow, who had {{previously}} defended Moyer, Haywood, and Pettibone in the Steunenberg murder case. Moyer and Darrow asked the governor to again try to arbitrate the strike. The strikers would not insist on mentioning the WFM in any settlement, but would insist on the right to organize and select representatives. Ferris was skeptical, saying it resembled his earlier rejected proposals: [...] "When James MacNaughton says that he will let grass grow in the streets before he will ever treat with the Western Federation of Miners or its representatives, I <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> says." [...] Moyer countered: [...] "I'm not willing to admit yet that James MacNaughton will not recognize organized labor before he dies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviews {{following}} {{months after}} publication contained limited positive {{appraisal of the}} poem. William Roberts's review, for the August 1816 British Review, was more positive than previous analysis but with no detail about the work: [...] "passing over the two other poems which are bound together with 'Christabel', called 'The Fragment of Kubla Khan', and 'The Pains of Sleep'; in which, however, there are some playful thoughts and fanciful imagery, which we would gladly have extracted if our room would have allowed it." [...] The next review came in the January 1817 Monthly Review, with the anonymous reviewer questioning: [...] "Allowing every possible accuracy to the statement of Mr. Coleridge, we would yet ask him whether this extraordinary fragment was not rather the effect of rapid and instant composition after he was awake, than of memory immediately recording that which he dreamt when asleep? By what process of consciousness could he distinguish between such composition and such reminiscence? Impressed as his mind was with his interesting dream, and habituated as he is ... to the momentary production of verse, will he venture to assert {{that he did not}} compose, and that he did remember, the lines before us?" [...] The review then concluded, [...] "His 'psychological curiosity', as he terms it, depends in no slight degree on the establishment of the previous fact which we have mentioned: but the poem itself is below criticism. We would dismiss it with some portentous words of Sir Kenelm Digby, in his observations on Browne's religio Medici: 'I have much ado to <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> speaketh confidently; that he is more beholding to Morpheus for learned and rational as well as pleasing dreams, than to Mercury for smart and facetious conceptions'." ...|$|E
