40|$|In {{semiconductor}} manufacturing {{there is a}} great demand for innovations towards higher cost-effectiveness. The increasing employment of advanced control systems for process and equipment control is one means to improve manufacturing processes effectively and, hence, to lower costs. A precondition for an accurate and fast control is the availability of process models. In this paper neural networks are applied to non-linear system identification as an alternative or addition to physical models. Neural empirical models are developed with the help of measured input and output data of a system or process. After a brief summary of the theory of neural networks their application to system identification is described in detail. The capabilities of the neural network models are demonstrated by several examples. The temperature dynamics of a vertical furnace for the oxidation of 300 mm wafers as well as the zone temperatures of a 150 mm LPCVD furnace are simulated and the results are verified by measurements. Moreover, in order to control wafer temperatures in <b>batch</b> <b>furnaces,</b> an appropriate model was developed and implemented in a model-based controller...|$|R

To reduce the environmental impacts, lightweight aggregate (LWA) was manufactured utilizing high-carbon fly ash (HCFA) (loss on ignition, LOI = ∼ 16. 3 %). Trial tests were conducted on high-carbon fly ash lightweight aggregate (HCFA-LWA) in a laboratory electric furnace and in a manufacturer's <b>batch</b> <b>furnace.</b> A new temperature profile was proposed for the HCFA-LWA sintering process in which carbon served as a partial fuel substitute during the burning period, which can decrease the sintering period in the sintering stage of the LWA and save energy...|$|E

The data collected from 15 semi-direct and 3 indirect bakeries consisted of: the dimensions of the oven, the temperature profiles of the combustion chamber and the baking oven, the baking time and the bread quality. It was found that as much as 60 tons/day of green wood are consumed in the bread baking process in the area investigated. Two types of bakery ovens are used most commonly: indirect and semi-direct. The specific consumption was found to be 0. 55 and 0. 90 kg of wood per kg of wheat flour baked for the indirect and the semi-direct respectively.

40|$|Operating {{conditions}} of the furnaces has the major effect {{on the quality of}} steel during steel production process. Furnaces also are the biggest energy consumer in the whole production process  which make them a center of concern, {{in order to get to}} the most optimized condition through both energy and quality aspects. Soaking pit furnaces are for heating steel ingots before rolling, in order to provide convenient conditions for ingots for further procedures. These <b>batch</b> <b>furnaces</b> are characterized by heat and temperature conditions that vary in time. The structure permits rapid heating of the metal inside the furnace, since heat is supplied over the entire surface of the ingot. One serious problem that these furnaces might contain is the existence of non-uniform temperature gradient inside the chamber that causes different temperature distribution on the ingots surface which leads to a bad surface quality of them, considering further rolling process. As the first step through obtaining the best temperature gradient inside the chamber, is to ensure the exact temperature condition in the current running procedure. In here as the first step through the problem solving of these furnaces, temperature profile, radiation profile and other effective parameters are investigated with the aid of CFD software. The simulation is done by ICEM and FLUENT programs for geometry and mesh designing, and modeling in respect. Modeling is based on four main steps:         I.             Modeling of the furnace chamber geometry and applying appropriate mesh style with ICEM       II.             Modeling the chamber with fluent, and taking the results (case 0)     III.             Modeling of six cases with different excess air, in order to investigate the best λ magnitude     IV.             Modeling of six cases with different burner capacities in order to investigate its affection on combustion parameter...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{recrystallization}} of hot-rolled aluminum strips was monitored inline after inline annealing at Commonwealth Aluminum Corporation (CAC) using laser-ultrasonics. The noncontact measurement {{is based}} on sensing {{the ratio of the}} compressional to the shear sound velocity in the strip thickness direction. This ratio is insensitive to strip thickness variations and varies with crystallographic texture and temperature. Therefore, recrystallization is sensed as a change of texture, from a rolling to an annealing texture. A pyrometer is used to decouple temperature and texture effects on the velocity ratio. The measurements were made on two alloys: AA 5754 and AA 5052. The capabilities and limitations of the sensor are discussed.
