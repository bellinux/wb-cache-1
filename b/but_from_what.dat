500|$|Despite many {{requests}} from Rail, WCRC chairman David Smith {{refused to comment}} on the incident. In an interview with Steam Railway, [...] he stated that the company was working to satisfy the seven demands made by Network Rail, and was only cancelling trains about a week in advance, in the hope that WCRC would be able to run trains again in the future. Responding to a comment by Smith that [...] "We are co-operating with the ORR in its enquiries, <b>but</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> we can see, all it is doing is keeping a watchful eye on what is going on", Rail editor Nigel Harris expressed astonishment at the [...] "jaw-dropping" [...] comments as criminal charges could lead to imprisonment following a guilty verdict. The reputational damage to WCRC was described as [...] "possibly commercially fatal". Rail contributor Pip Dunn said that WCRC refused to talk to journalists when negative stories concerning the company were being reported, yet was happy to when publicising a charter it was running. On 28 May, WCRC issued a press release apologising for the distress, disappointment and inconvenience caused by the incident and events arising from it. It also thanked the ORR and others for assistance and support given. It stated that it was giving full assistance to the RAIB in respect of its investigation into the SPAD.|$|E

500|$|He {{started the}} 2003–04 season at Rochdale, making 16 {{appearances}} and scoring five goals in League Two. Rochdale's new manager Steve Parkin criticised McEvilly's fitness level {{to play and}} had described him as [...] "too heavy", and that he needed [...] "to get his physique down to an acceptable weight where he can get around the pitch". Conference National club Accrington Stanley signed McEvilly on a one-month loan in January 2004, making his debut in their 3–0 home win against Tamworth on 20 January. Despite playing out of position in wide right, McEvilly commented; [...] "I was playing out of position but it was okay". He went on to describe the drop in level he said; [...] "I have never played in the Conference <b>but,</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> I have seen, it is no different to Division Three." [...] After a month at Accrington and making three appearances scoring one goal, his loan was extended in February for a further month, with manager John Coleman praising him as [...] "a great acquisition to the squad". McEvilly went on to make a further three appearances, scoring once more before returning to Rochdale. On his return to Rochdale, he scored a further one goal in 14 appearances. At {{the end of the}} season, McEvilly was released by Rochdale on 10 May, signing a dater for Accrington Stanley on a permanent basis after a previous loan spell. On 13 November 2004, McEvilly scored a hat-trick in Accrington's 5–0 home victory over Northwich Victoria. During the 2004–05 season he made 39 appearances in the Conference National, scoring 15 goals.|$|E
500|$|He led {{guerrilla warfare}} against Swedish troops of Charles X, {{a type of}} a {{campaign}} he authored, despite the objections of the hetmans, who by that time returned to serve under John Casmimir Vasa. The mobile Swedish forces, even with their significant firepower, proved to be rather vulnerable to Czarniecki's guerrilla-style warfare. Czarniecki was defeated {{at the battle of}} Gołąb in mid-February 1656, but later inflicted serious defeats upon the Swedes, notably at the Battle of Warka in April that year. The tide of the war turned several times that year, and he was again defeated at the battle of Kłecko and battle of Kscynia. His defeats, however, were limited, and in most cases he was able to retreat with most of his army in good order. Under his direction the popular rising against the Swedish troops in Greater Poland proved highly successful. It was against his advice that the battle of Warsaw was fought, and his subsequent strategy neutralized the ill effects of this defeat. Despite support from the king, Czarniecki was seen by many older, established noble family as an arrogant newcomer, and they prevented him from getting the hetman office that year; instead early next year he received the office of the voivode of Ruthenia, and an extraordinary title of the [...] "general and vice commander of the royal forces", which put him in a position of an unofficial hetman-like authority. The Field Crown Hetmanship went to Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski, also an accomplished commander, if not so much as Czarniecki – but from a magnate Lubomirski family; Czarniecki commented famously that [...] "Not of salt, or fields, I am, <b>but</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> hurts me", alluding to the fact that Lubormirski family built its fortune on salt trade and agriculture, whereas his smaller one was built through military service – yet it was money and politics, not military experience, that decided who was to get the hetman's office.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of Joseph, Nazareth was an obscure village in Galilee, about [...] from the Holy City of Jerusalem, which is barely {{mentioned}} in surviving non-Christian texts and documents. Archaeology {{over most of the}} site is made impossible by subsequent building, <b>but</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> has been excavated and tombs in the area around the village, it is estimated that the population was at most about 400. It was, however, only about 6 kilometres from the city of Tzippori (ancient [...] "Sepphoris"), which was destroyed by the Romans in 4 BC, and thereafter was expensively rebuilt. Analysis of the landscape and other evidence suggest that in Joseph's lifetime Nazareth was [...] "oriented towards" [...] the nearby city, which had an overwhelmingly Jewish population although with many signs of Hellenization, and historians have speculated that Joseph and later Jesus too might have traveled daily to work on the rebuilding. Specifically the large theatre in the city has been suggested, although this has aroused much controversy over dating and other issues. Other scholars see Joseph and Jesus as the general village craftsmen, working in wood, stone and metal {{on a wide variety of}} jobs.|$|E
