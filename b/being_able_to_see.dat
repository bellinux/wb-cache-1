5|$|As {{time went}} on, their props and stage {{equipment}} became increasingly sophisticated. When {{they started to}} fill stadium sized venues and bigger, they ran into {{the problem of the}} audience no longer <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them due to the increased seating capacity – this problem was especially clear in their free 2006 concert in Rio de Janeiro on the A Bigger Bang tour, which used over 500 lights, hundreds of speakers, and a video screen almost 13 metres in length. Due to the vast size of the beach which the Stones performed on (2.5km), sound systems had to be set up in a relay pattern {{down the length of the}} beach, in order to keep the sound in sync with music from the stage; for every 340 metres of beach, the sound had to be delayed an additional second.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DS's two screens {{act as one}} tall screen; however, in practice, this {{essentially}} {{just gives}} the player {{a better view of}} the surroundings and, save for one boss battle, (Hector the Reflector, where the bottom screen acts as a mirror through which to see Hector during the battle) only provides the benefit of <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> more (above) and, when the player is on the top screen, below. The game does not make use of the bottom screen's touch sensitivity for basic gameplay, though it is an option for selecting levels and in some mini-games. Each of DSs five worlds has two bosses, each with a weakness that must be identified and exploited. Most of the time, these are simply giant-sized versions of normal enemies, though some are more inventive.|$|E
5|$|Zerg {{buildings}} and units are entirely organic in-game, and all Zerg can regenerate slowly without assistance (though not {{as quickly as}} Protoss shields). Zerg production is far more centralized than with the Terrans and Protoss; a central hatchery must be utilized to create new Zerg, with other structures providing the necessary technology tree assets, whereas the other two races can produce units from several structures. Zerg units tend to be weaker {{than those of the}} other two races, but are also cheaper, allowing for rush tactics to be used. Some Zerg units are capable of infesting enemies with various parasites that range from <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what an enemy unit sees to spawning Zerg inside an enemy unit. In addition, Zerg can infest some Terran buildings, allowing for the production of special infested Terran units.|$|E

He believes that you should do work that you enjoy, otherwise it is not worth the effort. He derives satisfaction from the accomplishment of goals he has set for himself. It is important to stay focused.|$|R
50|$|Rahul (Ramankanth) sees {{a concert}} of pop singer Monisha (Mumtaj) and falls in love. He woos {{her over the}} phone but she, hating all men and love itself, resists his advances.

50|$|The {{church of}} Saint Atanasje Veliki: this {{magnificent}} white church is built semi-underground built in 1886 during the Ottoman empire. The reason being built half underground {{was due to}} the reigning Turks telling the villagers of Loznani that if a church was to be built, it was to be built without it <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> clearly by the Turks. The church also hold magnificent medieval Byzantine art full of beautiful icons of Mary, the burial of the Virgin Mary, the crucifixion, and many saints and martyrs. Alongside the church there is the church bell tower built at a height of 12 metres with tan and white bricks.|$|R
5|$|At 10:20, Wickson, the F-15C flight lead, {{reported}} entering northern Iraq to the AWACS controller {{responsible for}} air traffic inside the TAOR, USAF Lieutenant Ricky Wilson. The TAOR frequency that the F-15s were using {{was different from}} the en-route frequency being used by the two Black Hawks. Wilson, however, was monitoring both frequencies and <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> both Black Hawks on his radar scope before they disappeared at 10:12. Wilson and the other AWACS crew members, many of whom were monitoring the F-15s' radio frequency, did not inform the F-15s that Black Hawks were currently operating in the TAOR. At 10:21, Wilson, believing that the Black Hawks had landed again, asked Wang if he could drop the friendly helicopter symbols from the AWACS's scopes and Wang approved the request. An AWACS crew instructor, Captain Mark Cathy, who was on the mission to assist the AWACS crew and supervise Wilson on this, his first mission into the TAOR, had retired {{to the back of the}} airplane at 10:00 to take a nap.|$|E
25|$|Visual acuity {{measurement}} {{involves more}} than <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the optotypes. The patient should be cooperative, understand the optotypes, {{be able to communicate}} with the physician, and many more factors. If any of these factors is missing, then the measurement will not represent the patient's real visual acuity.|$|E
25|$|In Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle {{the use of}} {{a mirror}} to view people and places the viewer knew in the present was {{possible}} with the drawback of not <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> anything to which they had no knowledge.

5000|$|A leprechaun who {{has gone}} on {{vacation}} to the United States is captured by three boys who take him to their clubhouse. The leprechaun, annoyed to have his vacation disturbed, tells them {{that they may have}} one wish each. They flip a coin <b>to</b> <b>see</b> who goes first. Buddy wins the coin toss and makes a wish for X-ray vision. The next morning, Buddy tries his new power, begins <b>to</b> <b>see</b> beneath the local girls' clothing but then finds out that he is unable to control the intensity of his powers. He sees internal organs and skulls instead of <b>being</b> merely <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> under clothing. Seeing that Buddy has learned his lesson, the leprechaun reverses the wish.|$|R
60|$|When {{the meat}} was cooked Nessus {{satisfied}} his hunger and then sallied {{out from the}} cave and took his post as sentry with his spear close to {{the angle of the}} rock, as by this time the natives on the opposite side, <b>being</b> no longer <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in the gathering darkness, had ceased to shoot. Malchus ate his food at his leisure, and then joined his companion.|$|R
50|$|Public nudity {{refers to}} nudity {{not in an}} entirely private context, that is, a person {{appearing}} nude {{in a public place}} or <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> nude from a public place. Nudity on private property but where the general public is commonly free to enter, such as a shopping mall, public transport or swimming pool, is also considered public nudity. Nudity in the privacy of a person's home or grounds is not considered public nudity, nor is nudity at privately owned facilities where nudity commonly takes place, such as gymnasia, locker rooms, saunas, or specific nudist clubs or resorts. Naturism is a movement that promotes social nudity in nature, most but not all of which takes place on private property.|$|R
25|$|At around 17:00 Norwegian time on 14 April, 15 Junkers Ju 52 {{transport}} aircraft {{took off from}} Fornebu Airport near Oslo in hail and sleet with low cloud cover.

25|$|Children who {{are blind}} not only have the {{education}} disadvantage of not <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> — they also miss out on fundamental parts of early and advanced education if not provided with the necessary tools. Children {{who are blind}} or visually impaired can begin learning pre-braille skills from a very young age to become fluent braille readers as they get older.|$|E
25|$|Transformative {{products}} are exciting, but robo-pets {{are even more}} exciting. We were interested in making the technology very visible, but also playing with translucency and transparency, soft boundaries. The irony of the digital age is that, as technology gets more invisible, people {{are more interested in}} <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it again, as in Apple Computer's iMac, with its translucent blues and milky plastics that simultaneously tease and reveal.|$|E
50|$|Three great vistas are Nesfield's {{signature}} on today's Kew Gardens, London. In a 'goose foot' pattern radiating from the Palm House, Pagoda Vista was a grassed walk some 850 m (2,800 ft) long; Syon Vista was a wide gravel-laid walk stretching 1,200 m (3,937 ft) towards the Thames; while the third, short, vista fanned {{from the northwest}} corner of the Palm House and focused on a single 18th-century cedar of Lebanon towards Kew Palace. Pagoda Vista is lined with paired broadleaved trees with, flanking them and to their exterior, paired plantings of evergreens. Nesfield's idea of <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> both <b>see</b> and walk <b>to</b> the Pagoda along the centre line of Kew Gardens was, in fact, a return to the turn-of-the-century landscape.|$|R
40|$|The goal of <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> better <b>see</b> the {{vasculature}} of {{the organ}} that the surgeon wants {{to operate on}} has been always a crucial factor behind the development of better radiological imaging technologies. In urology nowadays, partial nephrectomy for re-nal cancer is expanding with more cases done with tumors that, in the past, were unthinkable to be qualified for Nephron Sparing Surgery (NSS). It is because we have better pictures of our radiological studies showing localization of tumors in relation to vessels and calyceal system much clearer [1, 2, 3]. The paper by Drewniak et al. [4] describes the meth-odology of the elaboration of CD images that can very precisely assess the arterial tree within the kidney, which is sure to make the planning of the surger...|$|R
40|$|Although {{scholars}} {{in the first two}} generations of humanism wrote the histories drawing heavily on ancient Roman sources, Petrarca was the first humanist historian to focuses on the history of ancient Roma. Because he was also the earliest to approach ancient Romans as historically conditioned human <b>beings,</b> he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the achievements of the Romans in historical perspective. At the same time he was unable to separate mythology from history and acknowledged the effect of divine and diabolical forces on the course of human events...|$|R

25|$|In 1992, Peacocks Shopping Centre, Library, Town Gate, Cinema and New Victoria Theatre and the Leisure Lagoon at Pool in the Park opened. Centre Halls, Centre Pool and Woking Centre Library {{had been}} {{demolished}} {{to make room}} for them. Then in 1996, The Planets Entertainment complex was completed. In 2010 the front of the Peacocks had a glass extension added onto it. Some locals criticised it for not <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the clock that was there previously.|$|E
25|$|For women's dress, {{the day to}} day outfit of {{the skirt}} and jacket style were {{practical}} and tactful, recalling the working class woman. Women's fashions followed classical ideals, and tightly laced corsets were temporarily abandoned {{in favor of a}} high-waisted, natural figure. This natural figure was emphasized by <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the body beneath the clothing. Visible breasts were part of this classical look, and some characterized the breasts in fashion as solely aesthetic and sexual.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept for}} this school is {{intended}} to evoke an archetypal African village, creating an organic urban complex of streets, buildings and open spaces. The studios, oval in plan, are the basic cell of the complex. Each one was conceived as a small arena theater with a central skylight to serve students working from a live model. The studios are organized along two arcs, {{both of which are}} curving colonnaded paths. Lecture rooms and offices are accommodated in a contrasting blocklike plan that is partially wrapped by and engaged with the colonnaded path. Ideas of gender and ethnicity converge in the curvilinear forms and spaces of Plastic Arts. Most notable is how the organic spatial experience of the curvilinear paseo archetectonico delightfully disorients the user not <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fully <b>see</b> the extent of the magic realist journey being taken.|$|R

In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and user interface of ImaNote focusing on issues arising from the web-based nature of the software {{as well as from}} its intended use as a tool for visualization and interaction with digital surrogates, facsimiles and replicas of cultural heritage objects...|$|R
25|$|J. B. Rhine's {{experiments}} with Zener cards were discredited {{due to the}} discovery that sensory leakage or cheating could account for all his results such as the subject being {{able to read the}} symbols {{from the back of the}} cards and <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> and hear the experimenter to note subtle clues. Once Rhine took precautions in response to criticisms of his methods, he was unable to find any high-scoring subjects.

25|$|Singapore Airlines also {{issued a}} {{statement}} {{after the release of}} the ASC report. In their statement, Singapore Airlines reiterated the points brought up by the Singapore investigators and added that air traffic control (ATC) did not follow their own procedure when they gave clearance for SQ006 to take off despite ATC's not <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the aircraft. Singapore Airlines also clarified that the paravisual display (PVD) was meant to help the flight crew maintain the runway centreline in poor visibility, rather than to identify the runway in use.|$|E
25|$|Paul Kroegel, a German immigrant, {{moved to}} Florida in 1881 and {{lived on the}} west bank of Indian River Lagoon.

5000|$|Being three-dimensional, we {{are only}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the world with our eyes in two dimensions.

5000|$|The Videoplace used projectors, video cameras, {{special purpose}} hardware, and onscreen silhouettes of the users {{to place the}} users within an {{interactive}} environment. Users in separate rooms in the lab were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{interact with one another}} through this technology. The movements of the users recorded on video were analyzed and transferred to the silhouette representations of the users in the Artificial Reality environment. By the users <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> visually <b>see</b> the results of their actions on screen, through the use of the crude but effective colored silhouettes, the users had a sense of presence while interacting with onscreen objects and other users even though there was no direct tactile feedback available. The sense of presence was enough that users pulled away when their silhouettes intersected with those of other users. (Kalawsky 1993; Rheingold 1992). The Videoplace is now on permanent display at the State Museum of Natural History located at the University of Connecticut. (Sturman and Zeltzer 1994).|$|R
50|$|Solarix is a first-person {{video game}} with a strong {{emphasis}} on stealth. Enemies patrol each level and will react to the sound of footsteps as well as <b>being</b> more easily <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the player when they are in lighted areas, encouraging players to move while crouched and remain in dark areas. Lights can be destroyed with weapons fire to create areas of darkness to sneak through. Enemies will also react to fresh bodies, which will trigger them into searching the area for the player, encouraging players to hide the bodies of killed enemies away from enemy patrol routes.|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} of laser heating began only 8 years after Charles Weir, of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), {{made the first}} diamond anvil cell and Alvin Van Valkenburg, NBS, realized the potential of <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the sample while under pressure. William Bassett and his colleague Taro Takahashi focused a laser beam on the sample while under pressure. The first laser heating system used a single 7 joule pulsed ruby laser that heated the sample to 3000°C while at 260 kilobars. This was sufficient to convert graphite to diamond. The major flaw of in the first system was control and temperature measurement.|$|E
25|$|After {{fending off}} another coordinated assault, the Marines were low on ammunition, {{and all of}} them had been wounded by that point. While the {{frustrated}} pilots circled the area without <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> clear targets, a C-47 deployed flares for illumination at around 01:00. Early into the morning, as Marines traded taunts with the enemy, the pilots began dangerously close attack missions, including one Air Force F105, Marine F8U Crusaders, and helicopter gunships. Armed UH-1Es stayed with the Marines through the morning {{until the end of the}} battle, often serving as airborne forward air controllers with the aid of Howard and his red-filtered flashlight.|$|E
25|$|Early in her {{scientific}} career, Doudna {{worked to}} uncover the structure and biological function of RNA enzymes or ribozymes. While in the Szostak lab, Doudna reengineered the self-splicing Group I catalytic intron into a true catalytic ribozyme that would copy RNA templates. Her focus was on engineering ribozymes and understanding their underlaying mechanisms. However, she {{came to realize that}} not <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the molecular mechanisms of ribozymes was a major problem. She went to the lab of Thomas Cech at the University of Colorado Boulder to crystallize and determine the three-dimensional structure of ribozymes. She started this project in the Cech lab in 1991 and finished it at Yale University in 1996. She joined Yale's Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry as an assistant professor in 1994.|$|E

60|$|And so {{the fight}} was ended. On {{returning}} from the shocking scene it suddenly struck me that I had seen nothing of Alphonse since the moment, some twenty minutes before -- for though this fight has taken a long while to describe, {{it did not take}} long in reality -- when I had been forced to hit him in the wind with the result of nearly getting myself shot. Fearing that the poor little man had perished in the battle, I began to hunt among the dead for his body, but, not <b>being</b> <b>able</b> either <b>to</b> <b>see</b> or hear anything of it, I concluded that he must have survived, and walked {{down the side of the}} kraal where we had first taken our stand, calling him by name.

So ancient was it that all the inside had in the course of ages decayed away, leaving nothing but a shell of bark.|$|R
