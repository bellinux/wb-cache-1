40|$|In today’s society {{companies}} facing increasingly challenges, {{competition and}} customer demands are constantly increasing. This {{has led to}} the traditional production approach no longer being sustainable. A philosophy that has been developed to meet these new types of manufacturing requirements is Toyotas Lean Manufacturing. Lean manufacturing was only meant for the car industry at first but has now been adopted by all types of manufacturing even in the public sector such as hospitals.   The purpose with this report is to increase the profitability in manufacturing of compressor bladethrough Lean philosophy and methods. Using Lean methods to identify unnecessary cost in the process means no big investment is required to increase profitability.   The goal of the report is to first identify problem areas in today’s manufacturing process and then come up with improvement suggestions enabling the company to lower their cost.   The work was done with an empirical data collection of qualitative and quantitative data through Interviews, observations, measurements and data analysis. The largest amount of data comes from primary data collected during the project. Secondary data such as inventory values ​​and manufacturing data were taken from the company database. Mapping of the current state shows that {{only a small part of}} the actual lead time is value-increasing time for the product and the time the customer is willing to pay for. Several problems and Muda were identified in the manufacturing process that causes non-value-increasing time. Based on the analyses, the most serious problem was defined as overproduction. The solution to overproduction was a Kanban system with Supermarket inventory. With the introduction of this new production and inventory planning system, the return on <b>bonded</b> <b>capital</b> in the internal stock would increase by approximate 127 %. By releasing the bound capital, an investment for purchase of machine parts that reduces the set-time can be made...|$|E

Russia became a net lender to the {{international}} banking system, as a complement to the prolonged period of large current account surpluses. The nonbank corporate sector in Russia began to have better access to both bank and nonbank sources of external finance, with improving investor perceptions and a favorable external environment.

50|$|Putnam makes a {{distinction}} between two kinds of social capital: <b>bonding</b> <b>capital</b> and bridging <b>capital.</b> <b>Bonding</b> occurs when you are socializing {{with people who are}} like you: same age, same race, same religion, and so on. But in order to create peaceful societies in a diverse multi-ethnic country, one needs to have a second kind of social capital: bridging. Bridging is what you do when you make friends with people who are not like you, like supporters of another football team. Putnam argues that those two kinds of social <b>capital,</b> <b>bonding</b> and bridging, do strengthen each other. Consequently, with the decline of the <b>bonding</b> <b>capital</b> mentioned above inevitably comes the decline of the bridging capital leading to greater ethnic tensions.|$|R

This study {{distinguished}} between bonding and bridging social capital, and examined relationships {{between these two}} types of social capital and economic well-being at the individual level. Bridging capital was measured as engagement in activities of various voluntary organizations, and <b>bonding</b> <b>capital</b> was measured by networks of kin and friends. The study first examined the impact of individual <b>bonding</b> and bridging <b>capital</b> on future economic well-being, and then the impact of individual economic well-being on future <b>bonding</b> and bridging <b>capital</b> development. The sample for the analysis included 3, 198 non-student adults from the National Survey of Families and Households. Multivariate analyses indicated that: (a) individual bridging capital was positively associated with future economic well-being, but individual <b>bonding</b> <b>capital</b> was not; and (b) individual economic well-being was positively associated with future bridging capital development, but not with future <b>bonding</b> <b>capital</b> development. The study has useful policy and practice implications. The findings suggest that poverty alleviation programs that integrate social capital as an essential element should focus on strategies to enhance bridging capital. On the other hand, policy makers and social service agents need to carefully consider potential financial barriers faced by low-income people when helping them to develop bridging capital...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{integrated}} and risk-based {{approach to the}} sequencing and coordination of reforms to develop domestic financial markets. The paper argues {{that there is a}} hierarchy of financial markets that reflects the complexity of risks in each market and the interlinkages among markets. On the basis of this hierarchy, a sequencing of market development and risk-mitigation measures is proposed to minimize both macroeconomic and financial risks. Capital account opening can complement (but not substitute for) domestic institutional and market reforms to support the growth of local financial markets. The paper also argues that domestic institutional investors are critical to market development and risk mitigation.

40|$|A {{social network}} confers {{benefits}} and advantages on individuals (and on groups), the literature refers to these advantages as social capital. This paper presents a micro-founded mathematical {{model of the}} evolution of a social network and of the social capital of individuals within the network. The evolution of the network is influenced by the extent to which individuals are homophilic, structurally opportunistic, socially gregarious and by the distribution of types in the society. In the analysis, we identify different kinds of social capital: <b>bonding</b> <b>capital,</b> popularity capital, and bridging <b>capital.</b> <b>Bonding</b> <b>capital</b> is created by forming a circle of connections, homophily increases <b>bonding</b> <b>capital</b> because it makes this circle of connections more homogeneous. Popularity capital leads to preferential attachment: individuals who become popular tend to become more popular because others are more likely to link to them. Homophily creates asymmetries in the levels of popularity attained by different social groups, more gregarious types of agents are more likely to become popular. However, in homophilic societies, individuals who belong to less gregarious, less opportunistic, or major types {{are likely to be more}} central in the network and thus acquire a bridging capital.

30|$|<b>Bonding</b> <b>capital</b> {{refers to}} {{personal}} relations {{that are based}} on a sense of collective identity such as family, close friendship and the sharing of the same culture or ethnicity. Siegler (2014) considers it to be concerned with whom people know and what they do to establish and maintain their personal relationships. Therefore, it concerns the quality, structure and nature of people’s relationships (Scrivens and Smith 2013). These relations influence physical and mental health, economic well-being and life satisfaction. Such factors are what Lin (1999 a) argued to be the outcomes or in other words the returns of social capital due to expressive actions. Furthermore, the urban poor in the developing world relies heavily on <b>bonding</b> <b>capital</b> to help them ‘get ahead’ (Woolcock 1998, 2005). It is not self-evident to the outsider that such reliance would remain the same in the situation of extreme vulnerability arising due to human-made or natural hazards. The next three sections present the attributes of <b>bonding</b> <b>capital.</b> These attributes are the quantity of relationships (structure and nature), the quality of relationships (norms of trust and reciprocity) and the degree of social influence in vulnerable urban settings.|$|R

40|$|Kīorahi is a Māori {{ball game}} that {{as part of}} a renaissance of Māori culture has been {{utilised}} by contemporary Māori and adopted as a popular pastime. The game is based on a traditional narrative emphasising perseverance and forgiveness. The sport utilises skills that players would be familiar with from participating in other popular Western sports and is accessible to players with no Te Reo Māori or prior knowledge of tikanga. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate why Māori players participate in kīorahi, whether this participation supported their self-identity as Māori and generated <b>bonding</b> <b>capital</b> for the players. The researcher was interested to find out whether participation in kīorahi supported the creation and maintenance of a Māori self-identity and created <b>bonding</b> <b>capital</b> that players could operationalise. To achieve this objective seven questions were formulated; what is the prime reason for Māori participation in kīorahi, is the primary reason Māori choose to play kīorahi because it is a Māori sport, what is the level of self-identity as Māori of kīorahi players in Waitaha, is kīorahi an activity chosen by Māori with low levels of self-identity as a Māori activity to participate in, does participating in kīorahi assist Māori players in strengthening their Māori identity, does participating in kīorahi allow Māori players to create <b>bonding</b> <b>capital,</b> and how do Māori kīorahi players in Waitaha operationalise <b>bonding</b> social <b>capital</b> created through participation in the sport. This study utilised a kaupapa Māori paradigm alongside a grounded theory approach. The primary collection instruments were a survey and an interview. Survey data was collected from 36 Māori kīorahi players via a convenience sampling method and then a judgement sample of ten players were selected for an interview. The interviewees were selected because they fell across spectrum of the researcher’s Māori self-identity and <b>bonding</b> <b>capital</b> models. The survey contained questions designed to; assess what characteristics of kīorahi players valued, determine where Māori players fell on Māori self-identity and <b>bonding</b> <b>capital</b> models designed by the researcher. The survey data from an open question about what the players enjoyed about kīorahi resulted in the following four kaupapa; the characteristics of the game’, ‘Whanaungatanga’, ‘Health benefits derived from playing’ and ‘Participation is enjoyable’. Five ranking questions asking players to; identify the importance of kīorahi being a traditional game, providing opportunities to socialise with other Māori, providing opportunities to socialise with people in general, utilise Te Reo Māori and keep fit, were all ranked positively by respondents. The survey data also indicated that the majority of Māori players had created <b>bonding</b> <b>capital</b> and were able operationalise it. When reviewing where the Māori players fell on the researcher’s Māori identity model surprisingly only four male respondents had a weak Māori selfidentity. The interview results showed that players also valued the same things about kīorahi as the survey respondents. The way in which interviewees operationalised their <b>bonding</b> <b>capital</b> differed slightly from survey respondents however. Kīorahi as a game attracts Māori participation because it is an accessible sport due to its use of actions similar to other sports and the fact that it is seen as fun, healthy and a traditional Māori sport that facilitates Te Reo Māori acquisition and learning about tikanga. The sport also facilitates the generation of <b>bonding</b> <b>capital,</b> though the way in which it is operationalised may need to be further explored. Kīorahi is a game that assists Māori in constructing and maintaining their self-identity as Māori, including those Māori whose self-identity as Māori is weak, through providing opportunities for Te Reo Māori acquisition, incorporation of other Māori into player’s social network and connections to a perceived authentic Māori narrative...|$|R

These developments have important ramifications.

The paper finds that despite relatively low financial integration, the impact of the crisis on LIC banks, particularly the largest ones, were not insignificant.

40|$|Social capital {{refers to}} trust, norms, and social networks. One {{of the most}} {{important}} features of social capital is its claimed capacity of promoting economic well-being. Theorists have assumed that any such effects vary according to the nature of different types of social capital. Using longitudinal data from a nationally representative dataset, this study investigates the differentiated effects of individual bonding and bridging social capital on subsequent personal income and income-to-needs ratios. The analyses demonstrate that bridging capital, indicated by involvement in various voluntary organizations, has small but significant effects on future economic wellbeing. However, <b>bonding</b> <b>capital,</b> indicated by connections with kin and friends as reflected through social activities, various help interactions, and perceived emergency supports, does not show such an impact. These findings lend support to the theoretical assumption that bridging capital is more effective than <b>bonding</b> <b>capital</b> in helping people advance economically. The findings have useful implications for community practice and the design of social programs...|$|R
40|$|Decentralized {{governance}} activities outside formal {{government institutions}} are expanding throughout the Western democracies, and informal relationships in these policy arenas become critical to government performance. We analyze relationships among stakeholders that provide political, technical, financial, and regulatory resources to water projects {{in one such}} governance arena. The risk hypothesis argues that bridging network capital increases productivity for low-risk coordination problems whereas <b>bonding</b> <b>capital</b> increases productivity for higher-risk cooperation dilemmas. We find that stakeholders who establish more relationships in networks of political support and financial assistance improve the performance of projects they support. In addition, greater bridging capital leads to greater productivity among participants in the financial assistance network, but productivity in the political support network is facilitated by <b>bonding</b> <b>capital.</b> Furthermore, self-interested organizations appear to seek the more productive type of relationship in each network, since bridging relationships are more prevalent among financial providers and bonding relationships among political providers. 2 To the extent that policymaking decisions migrate from formal institutions to informa...|$|R
40|$|Research {{indicates}} that migrants 2 ̆ 7 social media usage in Ireland enables a background awareness {{of friends and}} acquaintances that supports <b>bonding</b> <b>capital</b> and transnational communities in ways not previously reported. Interview data from 65 Polish and Filipino non-nationals in Ireland provide evidence that their social media practices enable a shared experience with friends and relations living outside Ireland that is not simply an elaboration of the social relations enabled by earlier Internet applications. Social media usage enables a passive monitoring of others, through the circulation of voice, video, text, and pictures, that maintains a low level mutual awareness and supports a dispersed community of affinity. This ambient, or background, awareness of others enhances and supports dispersed communities by contributing to <b>bonding</b> <b>capital.</b> This may lead to {{significant changes in the}} process of migration by slowing down the process of integration and participation in host societies while also encouraging continual movement of migrants from one society to another...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{contagion}} from Russia to Brazil in late 1998 under two dimensions— players involved {{and the timing}} of events. The data {{does not seem to}} reflect a compensatory liquidation of assets story by international institutional investors. It does contribute, however, to the suspicion that the contagion was triggered by foreign investors panicking from the Russian crisis, and joining local residents on their speculation against the Brazilian real. Adjusted correlations in the Brady market increase significantly during the crisis, which lends support to the view that if there was a contagion from Russia to Brazil, the most likely place of the transmission was the off-shore Brady market. Finally, the paper does not support the hypothesis that it was the liquidity crisis in mature markets, and not the Russian crisis, that timed the crisis in Brazil.
