5|$|In the Late Archaic {{the climate}} became {{more similar to}} modern {{with the end of}} the Hypsithermal. The number of Late Archaic Sites {{increased}} in Iowa, perhaps reflective of increased populations allowed by climate change and new subsistence strategies. The Late Archaic sees the first indication of mound building in Iowa, as well as direct evidence of domesticated plants, and large, long-term settlements. The Red Ocher Culture appeared in northeast Iowa, associated with copper artifacts and mound building. Numerous Late Archaic sites have been excavated in eastern Iowa, some showing the gradual adaptation of cultigens, including squash, little barley, marsh elder, and <b>barnyard</b> grass. Sites with evidence for early cultigens in Iowa include the Edgewater Park Site in Coralville, the Gast Spring Site, and the Sand Run Slough West Site. In western Iowa, Late Archaic sites are common, however large bison killing or processing sites are less common than before, and there is little evidence for the use of domesticated plants.|$|E
5|$|Ailanthus {{produces}} an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits {{the growth of}} other plants. The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), yellow bristlegrass (Setaria pumila), <b>barnyard</b> grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv. Sugar Snap) and maize (Zea mays cv. Silver Queen). It proved able to kill nearly 100% of seedlings {{with the exception of}} velvetleaf, which showed some resistance. Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the white ash (Fraxinus americana) being the only plant not adversely affected. The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity. Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure. Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. Seeds produced from exposed plants have also been shown to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts.|$|E

25|$|Soras eat a {{wide range}} of foods. Animals that are {{commonly}} reported as sora food items include snails (Gastropoda), crustaceans (Crustacea), spiders (Araneae), and insects (Insecta), mainly beetles (Coleoptera), grasshoppers (Orthoptera), flies (Diptera), and dragonflies (Odonata). Soras often eat the seeds of plants, such as smartweeds, bulrushes, sedges, and <b>barnyard</b> grasses. Seeds of annual wildrice (Zizania aquatica) and rice cutgrass are eaten by soras in the eastern United States. A literature review lists crowngrass (Paspalum spp.) and rice (Oryza sativa) as relatively important food sources for soras in the Southeast. Plants comprising <5% of the sora's diet are also listed and include spikerushes (Eleocharis spp.), duckweeds (Lemnaceae), pondweeds (Potamogeton spp.), panicgrasses (Panicum spp.), cordgrasses (Spartina spp.), and saltgrass (Distichlis spicata).|$|E

30|$|Because high nitrate {{concentrations}} in water can cause different health problems, {{it is necessary}} to protect drinking water in the study area. High nitrate concentrations are associated with improperly located wells. It is necessary to locate new wells uphill and least 20  m from feedlots, septic systems, <b>barnyards</b> and chemical storage facilities. Monitoring of nitrate in the tested wells should be continued, and specific rehabilitation measures of wells to end users should be proposed. Wherever possible, {{it is necessary to}} build a public water supply system to ensure safe drinking water.|$|R
50|$|Depending on climate, <b>barnyards</b> {{may contain}} trees for shade. A water source is also common; the {{watering}} trough in past times was supplied by {{water from a}} hand driven well, with the water kept in wooden or metal containers. The water trough was filled daily, perhaps by a pitcher pump, or by windmill power. Pumping the trough full, by hand, was often the chore of farm children. In modern times, a trough may be hand-filled with a hose, or an automatic water fountain designed for livestock may be installed {{in one or more}} locations.|$|R
500|$|Fellini scholar Thomas Van Order {{has pointed}} out that Fellini is equally free in the {{treatment}} of ambient sound in his films, preferring to cultivate what Chion has called, [...] "a subjective sense of point of audition", in which what is heard on screen mirrors a particular character's perceptions, as opposed to the visible reality of the scene. [...] As an example, ducks and chickens appear on the screen throughout Gelsomina's conversation with the nun, but, reflecting the girl's growing sense of enlightenment concerning her place in the world, the quacking and clucking of <b>barnyard</b> fowl dissolves into the chirping of songbirds.|$|E
500|$|As {{with many}} blues songs, Dixon's lyrics are {{ambiguous}} {{and may be}} seen on several levels.

Although Dixon described it in the latter terms, he added, [...] "I wrote it as a <b>barnyard</b> song really, and some people even take it that way!" [...] The lyrics are delivered in Howlin' Wolf's distinctive vocal style; music writer Bill Janovitz describes it as displaying a [...] "master singer's attention to phrasing and note choice, milking out maximum emotion and nuance from the melody".|$|E

[...] However, she was also an advocate for the involvement of women in business and politics. By 1966, she was telling audiences around the state, [...] "Why should women have any less say than men about the great decisions facing our nation?"
