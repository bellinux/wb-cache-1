50|$|The {{next step}} in McDaniel's basic {{training}} program was to teach the student's subconscious mind to solve the various guidance and control problems involved in hitting the aerial target by computing the varying parallax between his direct line-of-sight and the trajectory of the BB fired from the gun held alongside his head {{as a function of}} time, and also to identify and extrapolate the trajectory of the lofted flat-washer and its ever-decreasing rate of climb, and then to compute the time-to-target of the fired <b>BB,</b> <b>so</b> as to direct the arms and hands to point and shoot the gun so the fired BB will hit the washer at the washer's location in space {{at the end of that}} time-to-target period. McDaniel would swiftly teach the student's subconscious mind to solve those guidance problems and then use those solutions to direct the muscles to aim and shoot the BB gun simply by having the student shoot the BB gun at the target and observe the results, and then compensate for his miss on the next shot. Several critically important factors were involved in that process. The key factor here was that the student was not expected to hit the target and was instead told to bracket it: to stare at the target, note how far and in which direction his BB missed it, and to believe that with his next shot he was going to miss the target by the same distance but in the opposite direction. If he did that faithfully, he would soon end up hitting the target regularly. There were two reasons for that; first, this procedure was one of the basic means for training the subconscious very swiftly to solve the guidance-and-control problems; second, it removed the fear of failure from the equation, making the student no longer feel pressured to hit the target each time.|$|E

40|$|The {{support of}} quality of service (QoS) in the Internet {{has become one of}} the most {{important}} topics within the Internet community. The introduction of the Integrated Services (IntServ) and the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architectures was a major breakthrough in this direction. Enhanced by the Bandwidth Broker concept, DiffServ aims to provide QoS in the Internet through the prioritization of some IP flows over others. However, up to now the DiffServ architecture lacks a standard mechanism for the interaction between users/applications and the Bandwidth Brokers (<b>BB),</b> <b>so</b> that end-to-end QoS can be achieved. In this paper we present a distributed middleware architecture for the transparent support of QoS in the Internet. The paper focuses on bridging the gap that currently exists between applications and the network and presents the end-user application toolkit (EAT). The EAT middleware provides a framework for the presentation of network services to users, the description and selection of QoS parameters, the forwarding of reservation requests and the verification of the accredited QoS level. Through the concept of application profiles, it aims to support QoS for legacy applications, that is, commercial applications that cannot be modified to support QoS.

40|$|For some time, {{the use of}} {{rootstocks}} in viticulture is {{no longer}} considered only {{as a means of}} agronomic method to avoid the phylloxera damages (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae, Fitch, 1856), but as a tool to be able to influence the physiology of the cultivars and to adapt the vine’s behavior to the different soil conditions, the climatic characteristics and the cul- tivation techniques. In particular, it is increased the need to use the rootstock as a means to control the physiological processes of the plant, being the root activity closely related to that of the canopy, by exchanging signals and metabolites. The selection of the vine rootstocks started at the end of 1800, originated {{the main part of the}} rootstocks currently used in viticulture, using V. riparia and V. berlandieri. Subsequently, through the use of other genotypes were obtained new hybrids even more complex. Currently, in Italy there are 39 varieties of vine rootstock recognized on the National Register of Grapevine Varieties. but are essentially five, those used on large surfaces: Kober 5 <b>BB,</b> <b>SO</b> 4, 140 Ru, 1103 P, 110 R. In the past, for the diffusion has had an important role the need for nurserymen, who tended to favor rootstocks with excellent performance in propagation. While today there is a greater interest to satisfy the needs of viticulture’s tech- niques also as a consequence of the changed cultivations’ conditions. In fact, we need of new rootstocks able to adapt to environmental stresses caused by climate change in progress (mainly droughts and changes in the distribution of rainfall) and/or linked to new growing environments which have restricting factors for the vines. Moreover, the need to obtain specific qualitative characteristics (polyphenols content, grapes’ acidity, etc [...] ), suggest to deepen even more the aspects that can influence the wine quality. At the same time, it is necessary to reduce the period of selection (a new rootstock from crossing takes between 20 to 25 years), which through the use of molecular markers could also be reduced by half. In this paper we provided an overview about the behavior of some rootstocks tested in Tuscany during the last years. In particular, the survey covered the vigor, the productivity, and the characteristics of grapes at maturity, including the phenolic content.

To perform this study, two month-old plants produced from cuttings were inoculated with 5, 000 eggs per 3 -L pots, filled with steamed substrate and kept in a glasshouse covered with a black mesh to intercept 30 % of sun light and avoid heating of the substrates.

Results showed that the five rootstocks were resistant to the parasitism of the three Meloidogyne species, since their reproduction was limited and differed from two of the cultivars. Chardonnay was the most susceptible cultivar, mainly to the high level of parasitism by M. ethiopica, while Pinot Noir was moderately susceptible and Thompson Seedless showed the lowest susceptibility...|$|E

"Thesis supervisor: Dr. Michele Warmund. Norton is an {{important}} commercial grape cultivar commonly grown in Missouri and the surrounding region because of its wine quality and disease resistance. However, own-rooted Norton vines typically produce fruit with high pH, malic acid, and potassium, which are known to reduce quality, aging potential, and stability of wine. Additionally, own-rooted Norton vines often produce excessive vegetative growth. Thus, effects of selected rootstocks on Norton fruit composition, yield, and vegetative growth were studied in Phelps County, MO within a commercial vineyard during 2010 and 2011. Rootstocks included 3309 C, 101 - 14, Schwarzmann, 5 <b>BB,</b> <b>SO</b> 4, 1103 P, 110 R, 140 Ru, 1616 C, and 44 - 53 M. Own-rooted Norton vines were also included as a control. Rootstocks did not affect vegetative growth or fruit characteristics (organic acids, glucose, or fructose). However, Norton petiole contents of Ca and P were deficient on some rootstocks in 2010 and 2011. Vines on 101 - 14, 110 R, and 1616 C rootstocks produced greater fruit yield than own-rooted vines. Nitrogen, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, and Mn contents in juice were also affected by rootstock, but all were within acceptable ranges. While fruit yields were enhanced by the rootstocks, {{it may be necessary}} to alter fertilization and pruning practices to sustain high cropping.
