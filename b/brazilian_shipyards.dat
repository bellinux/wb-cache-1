25|$|Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, {{the former}} {{president}} of Brazil, also publicly criticized Vale's former CEO Roger Agnelli for the decision of ordering ships from Asian shipyards instead of building them in Brazil, where Lula da Silva has been trying to revitalize the shipbuilding industry to create more jobs and increase local demand for steel and other products. Agnelli, who later left his position following continued criticism, replied that the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>shipyards</b> did not have the capacity to build such ships and stated that {{during the past few years}} Vale had commissioned 51 vessels from <b>Brazilian</b> <b>shipyards.</b>|$|E
50|$|As with Portugal, the RN had {{a number}} of trawler-type {{warships}} on order from <b>Brazilian</b> <b>shipyards.</b> With the declaration of war by Brazil against Germany in 1942 these vessels were transferred to the Brazilian Navy for anti-submarine and escort duties.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} ships {{were built in}} <b>Brazilian</b> <b>shipyards.</b> Only the lack of {{capacity}} and urgent need for delivery meant that some vessels had {{to be built in}} foreign shipyards, particularly in Spain, France and Germany. In the ten years in which Quintanilha e Mendonça Dias occupied the Navy portfolio, France and Germany, replaced Portugal's traditional ally - England—as political allies and arms suppliers. Of all the new ships, the Class John Coutinho, designed by naval engineer and Rear Admiral Roger d'Oliveira, gained international recognition thanks {{to the quality of the}} project.|$|E
50|$|In yachting, Carabelli is {{well known}} for his Multimar 32' yacht project as the sailboats he {{designed}} have obtained important prizes in national and international IMS class competitions. Some of the Multimar 32 sailboats are: Gosto D'Água, Scirocco, Resgate, Mano a Mano, ESPN Brasil and Vmax. At the moment a Carabelli 30' sailing class is being made from his design by a <b>Brazilian</b> <b>shipyard.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a part of}} new developments included inside a holistic optimisation strategy during the design cycle of ships. The {{first part of the}} paper describes an algorithm to maximize the number of ship blocks and ship sections to produce in workshops during a certain time window. A tool was developed in order to support planners to improve the space utilization and workshop productivity. Thanks to this software, the scheduling is now done more efficiently and above all it takes less time. The second part of the paper describes a recent development of an algorithm able to generate a feasible blocks erection sequence starting from the blocks splitting definition. The idea is to integrate this module as a new functionality inside simulation software in order to take into account blocks sequence during the elaboration of the optimised production strategy. The two developments were validated on the lower hull of a semi-submersible platform coming from a new <b>Brazilian</b> <b>shipyard.</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Development of Namibia's navy {{has been}} slow, {{and the force}} was only {{formally}} established in 2004, fourteen years after independence. Extensive Brazilian aid has assisted {{in the development of}} the Namibian Navy. The original core group of personnel was only sent to Brazil in 1995 after Walvis Bay was integrated into Namibia in 1994. This group consisted of command and staff officers. They completed their studies in 1998 from the Admiral Wandenkolk Instruction Center in Rio de Janeiro. The Maritime wing headquarters was established in 1998, while in 2000 the Navy base construction at Walvis Bay started. Consisting of approximately 900 personnel the Navy deploys a small number of lightly armed patrol vessels. The first maritime wing commander was Captain Phestus Sacharia. The first ship to be commissioned into service was the donated patrol boat Oryx in 2002. Brazil and Namibia signed an agreement in 2004 for the delivery of a patrol boat and two smaller patrol craft. The newly built 200 ton patrol boat Brendan Simbwaye, built at the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>shipyard</b> INACE, was commissioned on January 19, 2009. An ongoing co-operation program allows Namibian sailors and naval officers to be trained by the Brazilian Navy; by 2009, 466 seamen had been trained. Brazil also provided assistance in preparing a nautical chart of the approach to Walvis Bay and consulting in charting the outer limits of the continental shelf. [...] The Brazilian Navy has also trained the Namibian Marine Corps.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to report}} the {{production}} management of domestic shipyards, with {{the inclusion of the}} national fleet renewal program. The study addresses how domestic production may or may not leverage its business and promote sustainable growth of the national shipbuilding industry. The largest national power generation company, Petrobras, began a program in 2008 to renew the fleet of marine support. This program included the construction of 146 offshore support vessels in <b>Brazilian</b> <b>shipyards.</b> With this, the Brazilian government promoted the revitalization of the national shipbuilding industry by introducing this segment in its Growth Acceleration Program (PAC) and decided that shipbuilding should have local content in its production...|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, Brazil {{purchased}} four enlarged Scorpènes for US$9.9 billion with {{a technology}} transfer agreement {{and a second}} agreement to develop a French/Brazilian nuclear-powered submarine. The hull of the first S-BR (S35) was laid down at Cherbourg on 27 May 2010 and is to be jumboized at the <b>Brazilian</b> Navy <b>Shipyard</b> in Sepetiba in late 2012. The latter three submarines will be built there entirely, and are planned to be commissioned in 2018, 2020, and 2021. The nuclear-powered submarine could be {{a variant of the}} Scorpène class (which would make it similar in concept to the [...] ) or one of the more powerful Barracuda class.|$|R
