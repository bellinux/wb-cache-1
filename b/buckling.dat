5|$|Interestingly, {{although}} the centrum of Hatzegopteryx {{is much more}} robust than Arambourgiania, their ratios of bone radius to bone thickness (R/t) are roughly the same (9.45 for Hatzegopteryx and 9.9 for Arambourgiania). This may represent a compromise between increasing bending strength and <b>buckling</b> strength; higher R/t ratios lead to improved bending strength, but weaker <b>buckling</b> strength. To compensate for this, Hatzegopteryx shows {{a number of other}} adaptations to improve <b>buckling</b> strength, namely the distinctive internal structures of the bones and the large articular joints of the vertebrae, the latter of which helps to distribute stress.|$|E
5|$|An MR venogram is also {{performed}} {{in most cases}} to exclude the possibility of venous sinus stenosis/obstruction or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. A contrast-enhanced MRV (ATECO) scan has a high detection rate for abnormal transverse sinus stenoses. These stenoses can be more adequately identified and assessed with catheter cerebral venography and manometry. <b>Buckling</b> of the bilateral optic nerves with increased perineural fluid is also often noted on MRI imaging.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>buckles</b> found in tie down straps. The two most common are {{threaded}} <b>buckles</b> and snap <b>buckles.</b> Threaded <b>buckles</b> work like those found on backpacks and duffel bags {{for the purpose of}} adjusting the length of the tie down strap. Snap <b>buckles</b> are also commonly found on backpacks and duffel bags to allow fastening of the strap. These two components are often used in conjunction with the threading <b>buckle</b> providing tension and the snap <b>buckle</b> providing fastening. While threading <b>buckles</b> come in metal varieties for use with tensioning fasteners like over-center and ratchet fasteners, snap <b>buckles</b> are often plastic and are not designed to withstand a great deal of tension.|$|R

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the setbacks at the Defile, Marj Ardabil and other similar disasters, the need to reinforce the <b>buckling</b> frontiers stretched the military and financial resources of the Caliphate. This was especially the case with the powerful Syrian army, the main pillar of the Umayyad regime, which was parcelled out to reinforce distant provinces. Eventually, this weakening of the Syrian army would be the major factor in the fall of the Umayyad dynasty during the civil wars of the 740s and the Abbasid Revolution that followed them.|$|E
5|$|People with OCD report activity-related {{pain that}} {{develops}} gradually. Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain, swelling, catching, locking, popping noises, and <b>buckling</b> / giving way; the primary presenting symptom {{may be a}} restriction {{in the range of}} movement. Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stageI; however, the onset of stageII occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis. The disease progresses rapidly beyond stageII, as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments. Non-specific symptoms, caused by similar injuries such as sprains and strains, can delay a definitive diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|Bronze Roman <b>buckles</b> came {{in various}} types. Not only used for {{practical}} purposes, these <b>buckles</b> were also decorated. A Type I Roman <b>buckle</b> was a “buckle-plate” either decorated or plain {{and consisted of}} geometric ornaments. Type IA Roman <b>buckles</b> were similar to Type I <b>buckles</b> but differed by being long and narrow, made of double sheet metal, and attached to small D-shaped <b>buckles</b> (primarily had dolphin-heads as decorations). Type IB “buckle-loops” were even more similar to Type IA <b>buckles,</b> only difference being that instead of dolphin-heads, they were adorned with horse-heads. There were also Type II <b>buckles</b> (Type IIA and Type IIB) used by Romans, but all types of Roman <b>buckles</b> could have served purposes for simple clothing as well, and predominantly, as a military purpose.|$|R

The female is larger than the male, although species size overall varies geographically, with larger animals associated with regions of higher rainfall. The male has distinctive genitalia and a loud and complex call generated by the frequent <b>buckling</b> of ribbed tymbals and amplified by abdominal air sacs.|$|E

25|$|Solutions of Donnell's eight order {{differential}} equation gives the various <b>buckling</b> modes of a thin cylinder under compression. But this analysis, {{which is in}} accordance with the small deflection theory gives much higher values than shown from experiments. So it is customary to find the critical <b>buckling</b> load for various structures which are cylindrical in shape from empirically based design curves wherein the critical <b>buckling</b> load Fcr is plotted against the ratio R/t, where R is the radius and t is the thickness of the cylinder for various values of L/R, L the length of the cylinder. If cut-outs are present in the cylinder, critical <b>buckling</b> loads as well as pre-buckling modes will be affected.

25|$|The <b>buckling</b> {{strength}} of a member {{is less than the}} elastic <b>buckling</b> {{strength of}} a structure if the material of the member is stressed beyond the elastic material range and into the non-linear (plastic) material behavior range. When the compression load is near the <b>buckling</b> load, the structure will bend significantly and the material of the column will diverge from a linear stress-strain behavior. The stress-strain behavior of materials is not strictly linear even below the yield point, hence the modulus of elasticity decreases as stress increases, and significantly so as the stresses approach the material's yield strength. This reduced material rigidity reduces the <b>buckling</b> strength of the structure and results in a bucking load less than that predicted by the assumption of linear elastic behavior.|$|E
