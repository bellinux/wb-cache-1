5|$|The colours {{used by the}} {{original}} Panthers were <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white. Home shirts were black with a <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white striped lining on the shoulders. When the club reformed in 1980, the <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white colours were also revived, with a gold lining also being added to the jerseys.

50|$|According to the 2007 Brazilian {{national}} resource, {{the white}} workers {{had an average}} monthly income almost twice that of <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> pardos (browns).

While the whites earned on average R$15.90 per hour, the <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> browns received R$11.40, when they worked the same period. Among the 1% richest population of Brazil, only 12% were <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> browns, while whites constituted 86.3% of the group.

5|$|An origin myth {{from the}} Murri people of Queensland, cited by Andrew Lang, {{describes}} how the Australian pelican acquired its <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white plumage. The pelican, formerly a black bird, made a canoe during a flood {{in order to save}} drowning people. He {{fell in love with a}} woman he thus saved, but she and her friends tricked him and escaped. The pelican consequently prepared to go to war against them by daubing himself with white clay as war paint. However, before he had finished, another pelican, on seeing such a strange piebald creature, killed him with its beak, and all such pelicans have been <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white ever since.|$|E

40|$|Several reports {{indicate}} that erythrocytes (RBCs) from <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> men have higher sodium concentrations than those from whites and women. One possible mechanism to explain this finding is {{a difference in the}} activity of Na+-K+-ATPase. To explore this possibility, we have studied the Na+ and K+ kinetics of RBC Na+-K+-ATPase and RBC Na+ and K+ concentrations in 37 normotensive <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites, both males and females. The maximal initial reaction velocity (Vmax) values for RBC Na+-K+-ATPase were lower in <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> men as compared with whites and women. Higher RBC Na+ levels were observed in <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> males vs. whites and females. Significant inverse correlations were noted between the Na+-K+-ATPase activity and RBC Na+ concentrations. These findings indicate that cellular Na+ homeostasis is different in <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> men as compared with whites and women. Since higher RBC Na+ concentrations have also been observed in patients with essential hypertension as compared with normotensive subjects, the higher intracellular Na+ concentrations in <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> men may contribute to the greater predisposition of these groups to essential hypertension...|$|R

5|$|Like other snake species, {{the forest}} cobra has skin covered in scales. Snakes are entirely covered with scales or scutes of various shapes and sizes, known as snakeskin as a whole. Scales protect {{the body of}} the snake, aid it in locomotion, allow {{moisture}} to be retained within, and alter the surface characteristics such as roughness to aid in camouflage. The dorsal scales of the forest cobra are smooth, glossy and strongly oblique. The colour of this species is variable, with three main colour morphs. Those from the forest or forest fringe, from Sierra Leone east to western Kenya and south to Angola are glossy black, the chin, throat and anterior region of the belly are cream or white, with broad black cross-bars and blotches. The sides of the head are strikingly marked with <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white, giving the impression of vertical <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white bars on the lips. The second colour morph, from the west African savanna, is banded <b>black</b> <b>and</b> yellow, with a black tail, the head is brownish-yellow on top, the lips, chin and throat are yellow. The third colour morph, from the coastal plain of east Africa, south to KwaZulu-Natal, inland to Zambia and southern Democratic Republic of Congo, is brownish or blackish-brown above, paler below, the belly is yellow or cream, heavily speckled with brown or <b>black,</b> <b>and</b> specimens from the southern part of its range have black tails. Melanistic (all black) specimens have been documented from west Africa.|$|E
