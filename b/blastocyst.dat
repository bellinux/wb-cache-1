5|$|The female tammar can {{conceive}} {{shortly after}} giving birth. Tammars undergo embryonic diapause and the <b>blastocyst</b> remains dormant {{for nearly a}} year. For {{the first half of}} the year, the presence of the joey in the pouch prevents the <b>blastocyst</b> from developing and experiments have shown that removing the joey within this first half will stimulate the blastocyst's development. However, after this the <b>blastocyst</b> remains dormant even after the joey has left. It begins to develop by the summer solstice in the end of December and the female gives birth around one month later. After birth the newborn young climbs unaided by its mother from the birth canal to the pouch.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{systematically}} examine blastocoelic fl uid reduction prior to vitrifi cation and its potential benefi ts. In addition, we compared artifi cial collapse (AC) by laser pulse to a mechanical method. Mouse and dicarded human <b>blastocysts</b> were used in this study. <b>Blastocysts</b> were collapsed using either a 10 ms pulse with a laser (LAC) or else mechanical puncture with a microneedle (MAC). <b>Blastocysts</b> were vitri-fi ed on cryoloops using a two-step ethylene glycol/dimethyl sulfoxide protocol. We examined the effects of AC on specifi c outcome parameters such as overall survival, reexpansion, cell proliferation, and DNA dam-age. Unlike others, we report overall high survival rates with expanded <b>blastocysts</b> even without fl uid reduc-tion. We did detect a signifi cant increase in blastomeres showing signs of DNA damage in the control group (13 %) in comparison to <b>blastocysts</b> AC prior to vitrifi cation (LAC 3 %, MAC 5 %; p < 0. 001). Control <b>blastocysts</b> exhibited a lower rate of reexpansion. Within 3 h of warming, 73 % and 81 %, respectively of mechanically or laser collapsed <b>blastocysts</b> were fully reexpanded as compared to only 53 % of control <b>blastocysts</b> (p < 0. 001). Overall blastomere count was also signifi cantly lower in control <b>blastocysts</b> (CT 103 + 32, MAC 121 + 37, LAC 134 + 35; p < 0. 0001). Early <b>blastocysts</b> with smaller blastocoelic volumes did not benefi t from any further reduction of fl uid volume.

5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the fisher lasts almost a year. Female fishers {{give birth to a}} litter of three or four kits in the spring. They nurse and care for their kits until late summer, when they are old enough to set out on their own. Females enter estrus shortly after giving birth and leave the den to find a mate.

5|$|The {{secretory}} {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the uterine cycle and it corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. During the secretory phase, the corpus luteum produces progesterone, which plays a vital role in making the endometrium receptive to implantation of the <b>blastocyst</b> and supportive of the early pregnancy, by increasing blood flow and uterine secretions and reducing the contractility of the smooth muscle in the uterus; it also has the side effect of raising the woman's basal body temperature.|$|E
25|$|A Cochrane {{systematic}} review updated in 2012 showed that <b>blastocyst</b> stage transfer {{is more effective}} than cleavage (day 2 or 3) stage transfer in assisted reproductive technologies.

40|$|Earlier studies {{reported}} that neural stem (NS) cells injected into <b>blastocysts</b> {{appeared to be}} pluripotent, differentiating into cells of all three germ layers. In this study, we followed in vitro green fluorescent protein (GFP) -labeled NS and embryonic stem (ES) cells injected into <b>blastocysts.</b> Forty-eight hours after injection, significantly fewer <b>blastocysts</b> contained GFP-NS cells than GFP-ES cells. By 96 hours, very few GFP-NS cells remained in <b>blastocysts</b> compared with ES cells. Moreover, 48 hours after injection, GFP-NS cells in <b>blastocysts</b> extended long cellular processes, ceased expressing the NS cell marker nestin, and instead expressed the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. GFP-ES cells in <b>blastocysts</b> remained morphologically undifferentiated, continuing to express the pluripotent marker stage-specific embryonic antigen- 1. Selecting cells from the NS cell population that preferentially formed neurospheres for injection into <b>blastocysts</b> resulted in identical results. Consistent with this in vitro behavior, none of almost 80 mice resulting from NS cell-injected <b>blastocysts</b> replaced into recipient mothers were chimeric. These results strongly {{support the idea that}} NS cells cannot participate in chimera formation because of their rapid differentiation into glia-like cells.

40|$|Bovine in vivo and {{in vitro}} {{produced}} embryos {{at different stages}} of development were exposed to a vitrification procedure which has already resulted in a high in vitro survival rate for bovine in vivo compact morulae-early <b>blastocysts.</b> The vitrification solution consisted of 7. 15 M ethylene glycol, 2. 5 mM ficoll and 0. 3 M sucrose (EFS solution). Compact morulae-early <b>blastocysts,</b> <b>blastocysts</b> and expanded <b>blastocysts</b> were transferred into straws and immersed into liquid nitrogen after 3 minutes exposure to EFS solution. The average post-thaw survival rate for the different stages of in vivo and in vitro embryos was 66. 7 %, 15 %, 10 %, and 0 %, 4. 8 % and 10. 5 %, respectively. The overall survival rate of the in vivo and in vitro embryos was 38. 6 % and 5 %, respectively. It is concluded that in vivo derived embryos are more resistant to vitrification and their average survival rate is significantly higher than of in vitro embryos (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficiency of vitrified <b>blastocysts</b> derived from frozenthawed cleavage stage embryos in terms of morphological survival and re-expansion status of the blastocoelic cavity. Results: After warming 162 <b>blastocysts</b> derived from fresh embryos (= control group) and 90 <b>blastocysts</b> from frozenthawed cleavage stage embryos (= study group) and after 2 – 3 h of in vitro culture the percentage of <b>blastocysts</b> with morphological survival was not different between the two groups. After 24 h of in vitro culture, the percentage of fully expanded, hatching or hatched <b>blastocysts</b> was not different between both groups. Conclusion(s) : The results show that <b>blastocysts</b> derived from frozen-thawed cleavage stage embryos can be cryopreserved successfully a second time by vitrification method.

Suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) was used to construct a cDNA library enriched for transcripts preferentially expressed in in vivo-derived equine <b>blastocysts</b> compared with IVP <b>blastocysts.</b> Of the 62 different genes identified in this way, six genes involved in embryonic development (BEX 2, FABP 3, HSP 90 AA 1, MOBKL 3, MCM 7 and ODC) were selected to confirm this differential expression by reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Using RT-qPCR, five genes were confirmed to be significantly upregulated in in vivo-derived <b>blastocysts</b> (i. e. FABP 3, HSP 90 AA 1 (both P< 0. 05), ODC, MOBKL 3 and BEX 2 (P< 0. 005 for all three)), confirming the results of the SSH.

Initially, Day 6 peri-hatching <b>blastocysts</b> were collected, cultured for 40 min in 7. 5 microg/ml cytochalasin B and vitrified in 6. 5 M glycerol and 6 % BSA (VS 1) in either heat-sealed (HS) or open straws (OS). The post-thaw survival of those stored in HS was 15. 4 % after 24 and 48 h in vitro; storage in OS significantly improved survival (58. 8 % for both 24 and 48 h). When similar stage <b>blastocysts</b> were cultured in cytochalasin B and vitrified with 8 M ethylene glycol and 7 % polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; VS 2) in OS, survival was 44. 4 and 33. 3 % for 24 and 48 h, respectively. Day 5 late morulae and early <b>blastocysts</b> were collected, cultured with cytochalasin B, and centrifuged or left intact (control), then vitrified with VS 1 in HS or OS, or vitrified in VS 2 in OS only. None of the intact control embryos survived thawing and 48 h culture in vitro. Centrifuged early <b>blastocysts</b> vitrified with VS 1 showed good post-thaw survival in culture when stored in HS (62. 8 and 60. 5 % for 24 and 48 h, respectively), or OS (75 and 63. 6 %). When vitrified with VS 2 in OS, survival improved (80 and 76. 7 %). Peri-hatching <b>blastocysts</b> were vitrified in VS 1, and early <b>blastocysts</b> were vitrified with VS 1 and VS 2.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of rabbit <b>blastocysts</b> {{and their}} uterine environment after ovariectomy was studied; the experimental period after ovariectomy varied from 17 to 26 hr. Most {{of the experiments}} were concerned with <b>blastocysts</b> recovered from rabbits spayed at 6 days; a few relate to embryos from animals spayed on day 5 or 7 of gestation. Ovariectomy resulted in variable, often considerable, embryonic loss. Following bilateral ovariectomy at 6 - 6 = 1 / 2, implantation on day 7 was completely prevented; those <b>blastocysts</b> which survived showed evidence of expansion and differentiation during the interval after ovariectomy. This provided an opportunity (1) to assess the stage of development, and mitotic activity, as well as certain biochemical characteristics, in embryos surviving ovariectomy, and (2) to use the free-lying 7 -day-old <b>blastocysts</b> for culture experiments. It was found that mitotic activity went on in <b>blastocysts</b> after ovari-ectomy. Upon transfer to suitable culture media the unimplanted 7 -day-old <b>blastocysts</b> continued to grow and differentiate, the most advanced stage observed {{at the end of}} a 24 hr. period of incubation in vitro being the development of blood islands, primitive groove, and head process.

Then, the differentially expressed miRNAs were assessed using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. Overall, 760 known mouse miRNAs were detected in the vitrified and fresh mouse <b>blastocysts.</b> Of these, the expression levels of five miRNAs differed significantly: in the vitrified <b>blastocysts,</b> four miRNAs (mmu-miR- 199 a- 5 p, mmu-miR- 329 - 3 p, mmu-miR- 136 - 5 p and mmu-miR- 16 - 1 - 3 p) were upregulated, and one (mmu-miR- 212 - 3 p) was downregulated. The expression levels of all miRNAs measured by the miRNA Taqman assay based method and qRT-PCR were consistent. The four upregulated miRNAs were predicted to regulate 877 candidate target genes, and the downregulated miRNA was predicted to regulate 231 genes.

Put another way, the chimera is formed from the merging of two nonidentical twins (although a similar merging presumably occurs with identical twins, but as their DNA is almost identical, the presence would not be immediately detectable in a very early (zygote or <b>blastocyst)</b> phase).
