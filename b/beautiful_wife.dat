500|$|Shia Muslims, however, do not esteem {{him because}} they believe that he helped Abu Bakr in suppressing the {{supporters}} of Imam Ali who, according to them, was appointed by Muhammad as his political and religious successor. He killed Malik ibn Nuwayrah, and [...] "married" [...] his <b>beautiful</b> <b>wife</b> on the same day, Layla bint al-Minhal, which violated the sharia law. Shias also criticize him for fiercely opposing the message of Islam and fighting the Prophet Muhammad and Ali, for example, at the Battle of Uhud. As mentioned in Sahih al-Bukhari, he was sent by Muhammad to deal with the Arab tribe Jadhima. There, he fought them and ordered killing of all the captives, which was met with opposition and protests from other Muslims. Upon hearing about his actions, Muhammad raised both his hands and said twice, “O Allah! I am free from what Khalid has done.” ...|$|E

500|$|Nothing {{is known}} of his early life before 1259, when he is {{mentioned}} for his participation in the events {{that led up to}} the Battle of Pelagonia, where he led a contingent of Vlachs. By that time, he was already married to a daughter of the Thessalian Vlach chieftain Taronas. She is only known by the monastic name she assumed after his death, Hypomone ("Patience"). This association with Thessaly has led to suggestions by modern scholars that he ruled Thessaly in his father's name, but there is no concrete evidence to back this up. It is equally unclear whether the Vlach troops he commanded were part of the official Epirote army, or a privately raised force. John {{played a crucial role in}} the Battle of Pelagonia, where his desertion from the coalition composed by his father, Prince William II Villehardouin of Achaea, and King Manfred of Sicily, contributed to the defeat of the allies by the forces of the Nicaean Empire under John Palaiologos, Michael VIII's brother. The reason for the defection is unclear, as the various sources offer conflicting accounts. Both George Pachymeres and Marino Sanudo Torcello however report that during the march, John became incensed at some Achaean knights, who openly coveted his <b>beautiful</b> <b>wife.</b> Matters were made worse when William of Villehardouin not only did not punish his men, but also insulted John Doukas for his illegitimate birth, prompting the latter to defect before the battle, after receiving assurances that he would not have to fight his own father; thereupon the Epirotes too left, and the Latin troops were overwhelmed by the Byzantines.|$|E

2500|$|William Worth Belknap (September 22, 1829 [...] October 12, 1890) was a lawyer, {{soldier in}} the Union Army, {{government}} administrator in Iowa, and the 30th United States Secretary of War. [...] Belknap served with distinction in the Civil War and as an appointed Internal Revenue collector. However, his tenure in Washington D.C. as President Grant's appointed Secretary of War was controversial, with Belknap accused of indirectly selling weapons to France while the United States was ostensibly neutral during the Franco-Prussian War, and accepting illegal payments, known as kickbacks, in exchange for making a tradership appointment. The holders of traderships received exclusive rights to sell goods at U.S. military posts (and often did so at exorbitant prices), making them lucrative and highly sought after. His lavish Washington parties hosted by his <b>beautiful</b> <b>wife</b> Amanda brought on the envy of Democrats, who had regained control of the House in 1875, and worked to spotlight corruption in the Grant administration. In 1876, the trader post scandal led to Belknap's resignation, impeachment by the House, and trial by the Senate. [...] A majority of senators voted to convict; because the prosecution did not obtain the required two-thirds majority, Belknap was acquitted.|$|E
