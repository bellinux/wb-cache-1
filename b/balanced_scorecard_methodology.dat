40|$|The Joint Technology Exchange Group (JTEG), {{a part of}} the Joint Depot Maintenance Activity Group (JDMAG), {{exists to}} {{disseminate}} information on new technologies throughout the DoD depot cornmunity. Its objectives are to reduce redundancy and enhance the capabilities of depots, potentially lowering sustainment costs for the equipment they work on. However, because JTEG operates in a technology environment where financial benefits are vague and uncertain, JDMA() has identified a need to assess the effectiveness of the JTEG. To judge which attributes are most beneficial, this thesis performed a review of technology transfer, value of information, cornmunication, and current performance measurements in organizations. Four depots were visited to understand their use of new technology. An analysis of the roles and abilities of JTEG and needs of the depots is done, and metrics are developed to properly capture the effectiveness of JTEG. Performance metrics are based on <b>balanced</b> <b>scorecard</b> <b>methodologies</b> to emphasize effort that is linked to goals. The study finds the service JTEG supplies is not in line with what depots demand. The performance metrics highlight two major areas of activity for JTEO, processes and projects.

40|$|There is a {{wide body}} of {{evidence}} showing {{a significant increase in}} the adoption of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) worldwide. Moreover, research confirms that the integration and implementation stage (post-M&A) has a major impact on the success or failure of a merger or acquisition. Therefore it has become increasingly important to explore the post-M&A phase further in order to support the management teams of organizations pursuing a merger or acquisition in meeting all their desired objectives. This paper proposes a framework to help in the successful execution of M&A. The framework contains three main elements: the motives, success factors and key success indicators (KSI). A qualitative research approach using the multiple case study methodology was conducted to test the framework. Ten case studies were selected from the industrial sector in Egypt and used to validate the research. The final version of the M&A framework was provided after applying the research results. Considering the practical implications of the M&A framework, a tool was proposed for its application in light of the <b>balanced</b> <b>scorecard</b> (BSC) <b>methodology.</b> The proposed M&A scorecard tool should be used in the strategic planning and execution of M&A.

40|$|The <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecard</b> (BSC) <b>methodology</b> {{focuses on}} major {{critical}} issues of modern business organisations: the effective measurement of corporate {{performance and the}} evaluation of the successful implementation of corporate strategy. Despite the increased adoption of the BSC methodology by numerous business organisations during the last decade, limited case studies concern non-profit organisations (e. g. public sector, educational institutions, healthcare organisations, etc.). The main aim {{of this study is to}} present the development of a performance measurement system for public health care organisations, in the context of BSC methodology. The proposed approach considers the distinguished characteristics of the aforementioned sector (e. g. lack of competition, social character of organisations, etc.). The proposed measurement system contains the most important financial performance indicators, as well as non-financial performance indicators that are able to examine the quality of the provided services, the satisfaction of internal and external customers, the self-improvement system of the organisation and the ability of the organisation to adapt and change. These indicators play the role of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), in the context of BSC methodology. The presented analysis is based on a MCDA approach, where the UTASTAR method is used in order to aggregate the marginal performance of KPIs. This approach is able to take into account the preferences of the management of the organisation regarding the achievement of the defined strategic objectives. The main results of the proposed approach refer to {{the evaluation of the}} overall scores for each one of the main dimensions of the BSC methodology (i. e. financial, customer, internal business process, and innovation-learning). These results are able to help the organisation to evaluate and revise its strategy, and generally to adopt modern management approaches in every day practise.

40|$|Several {{organizations}} have implemented performance evaluation systems that use a balanced and structured set of financial and non-financial indicators, {{in order to}} evaluate both {{tangible and intangible assets}} of a firm in medium and long-term perspectives. In a previous work, we proposed a <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecard</b> (BSC) <b>methodology</b> for the definition the strategy of a firm and the performance indicators, in terms of the expectations of the customers and firm owners, the internal and external processes and the available and necessary resources. However, a relevant question is how to combine these measures to obtain, in a balanced way, a global evaluation of the firm and to compare it with other firms faced to the same economic and competitive environment. It is also necessary to evaluate the relative importance of these measures, to avoid giving an excessive weight to certain aspects {{at the expense of the}} others. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a tool that can be used to complement this methodology and calculate the global performance of a firm by means of a weighted sum of the set of performance indicators. Moreover, one can construct the performance frontier for a set of firms and the relative global performance that characterizes each firm. However, an important question is the determination of these weights. In this work, we propose an approach that relates the set of strategic objectives and the strategic map obtained b...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the past}} few years the Balanced Scorecard has become a key tool for {{managing}} and implementing strategy in organizations. Responding to this business demand, many analytical application, ERP, and database vendors are developing and releasing software to support executive decision-making using the <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecard</b> <b>methodology.</b> This development of software-enabled Balanced Scorecards will inevitably lead to the implementation of Balanced Scorecards at an increasing number of organizations throughout the world. Central to the <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecard</b> <b>methodology</b> is holistic vision of a measurement system tied to the strategic direction of the firm. The Balanced Scorecard is based on strategic implementation through focus on four perspectives, with financial objectives and measures supported by customer, internal, and learning and growth objectives and metrics. By measuring and managing the business using this balanced set of measures, an organization can ensure rapid and effective implementation of strategy and facilitate organizational alignment and communication.
