40|$|What {{are we to}} make {{of works}} of art whose {{apparent}} point is to convince us of the meaninglessness and absurdity of human existence? I examine, in this paper, the attempt of Albert Camus to provide <b>philosophical</b> <b>justification</b> of art in the face of the supposed fact of absurdity and note its failure as such with specific reference to Sartre’s criticism. Despite other superficial similarities, I contrast Camus’s concept of the absurd with that of his ‘existentialist’ colleagues, including Sartre, and suggest that the latter concept is more philosophically viable. I conclude that existential phenomenology consequently provides a more promising <b>philosophical</b> <b>justification</b> for artistic creation in the light of the more viable conception of absurdity...|$|R

50|$|The <b>philosophical</b> <b>justification</b> {{stems from}} God's aseity: the non-contingent, {{independent}} and self-sustained mode of existence that theologians ascribe to God. For {{if he was}} not morally perfect, that is, if God was merely a great being but nevertheless of finite benevolence, then his existence would involve an element of contingency, because one could always conceive of a being of greater benevolence. Hence, omnibenevolence is a requisite of perfect being theology.|$|R

40|$|This Article {{examines}} the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{treatment of the}} Eighth Amendment with respect to claims of excessive prison sentences. Specifically, it addresses {{the issue of whether}} and to what degree the Eighth Amendment requires that a punishment not be disproportionate to the crime. In analyzing all of the modern holdings of the Court in this area, this Article finds significant fault with each. The result of this series of flawed opinions from the Supreme Court is that the state of the law with respect to proportionality in sentencing is confused, and what law can be discerned rests on weak foundations. This Article begins with an analysis of the modern proportionality decisions of the Supreme Court in non-capital cases. It discusses the various approaches taken by members of the Court and tracks these approaches through each of the cases. The second portion discusses the <b>philosophical</b> <b>justifications</b> of punishment and the impact these justifications have on attempts to frame a proportionality standard. This Article concludes by recommending a constitutional standard consistent with accepted <b>philosophical</b> <b>justifications</b> of punishment and embodying principles determined by the Supreme Court to be of critical importance...|$|R
