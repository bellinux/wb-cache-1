40|$|The {{policy of}} Euro-area officialdom {{in the period}} 2010 - 2011 was to avoid, at all costs, a default and {{restructuring}} of the sovereign debt {{of a member of}} the monetary union. This policy was motivated principally, but not exclusively, by a fear that the international capital markets, if forcibly reminded of the precarious position of overindebted, growth-challenged members of a monetary union, might recoil generally from lending to European sovereigns. In short, they feared contagion. The only alternative to permitting a debt restructuring, of course, was an official sector bailout. The afflicted countries [...] Greece (until 2012), Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus [...] received loans from official sector sources sufficient to allow them to repay in full their maturing <b>bond</b> <b>indebtedness.</b> Whenever and wherever the crisis erupted, contagion was thus held in check by the blunt technique of smothering the outbreak [...] in money. The proponents of this policy argued at the time, and argue now, that many European sovereigns in 2010 were far too fragile to endure a bout of market contagion. They argued that an acute crisis needed to be averted in order to buy time for the implementation of a gradual but more durable remedy. Had the intervening eight years been used to reduce the debt vulnerabilities of the peripheral (and even some core) states, this argument would now be powerful, indeed invincible. Unfortunately, the opposite happened. Average state indebtedness in Europe today is about one-third larger than it was in 2008. Both the member states and the market saw the reprieve as spreading a reliable official sector safety net under their exposure. So they kept on borrowing and lending. Only the zero interest rate policies of the world’s major central banks during this period have kept debt servicing costs at tolerable levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{external}} debt of emerging market sovereign borrowers is now {{mainly in the}} form of bonds held by numerous institutional and individual bondholders. Many of these bonds are governed by the law of the state of New York. As a matter of drafting convention, bonds for sovereign issuers governed by New York law prohibit amendments to the payment terms of the instruments (the amount and the due dates of payments) without the consent of each affected bondholder. If a sovereign issuer finds it necessary to seek a restructuring of its <b>bond</b> <b>indebtedness,</b> it must therefore implement the restructuring by offering to exchange its old bonds for new debt instruments that reflect the new financial terms; a technique that inevitably risks leaving behind 2 ̆ 2 holdout 2 ̆ 2 creditors who may refuse to accept the proposed restructuring. Holdouts pose a litigation threat to the sovereign and may even jeopardize the sovereign 2 ̆ 7 s ability to service the new bonds it has issued to the other creditors participating in the exchange. A number of ideas - ranging from international bankruptcy codes and stays of creditor legal remedies administered by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to reforming the explicit terms of sovereign bond contracts - have been suggested as a means of dealing with the holdout creditor threat. This article suggests a less radical, and more immediately applicable, alternative; allowing the majority creditors to use the amendment clauses in their existing bonds to change certain nonpayment terms contained in those bonds (such as financial covenants or waivers of sovereign immunity) as a means of encouraging prospective holdouts to participate in the exchange. Because the sovereign issuer solicits the consent of its creditors to amend the old bonds just as those lenders exchange their bonds for the sovereign 2 ̆ 7 s new debt instruments, this techinque is referred to as an 2 ̆ 2 exit 2 ̆ 2 consent...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} three decades, economic, business, and social historians have been striving to {{understand}} whether America was economically independent from Britain, particularly whether {{it was able to}} revolt by 1776 because it was no longer inextricably tied to the mother country, by <b>bonds</b> of <b>indebtedness,</b> for the satisfaction of its agricultural, commercial, and manufactured needs [McCusker and Menard, 1986] 1.

Capital accumulation was critical to this colonial evolution, and specific information on the sources and destinations of colonial capital helps us form tentative conclusions abouthe financial independence of eighteenth-century America. For no plantation economy is there a detailed historical study of the role that the flow of capital and credit played in its development. There is no examination of the geographical sources and destinations of capital and credit, the linkages between capital and countryside, and the complicated, interwoven, financial relationships that held a colony together and to its mother country.

50|$|Based on the {{cultivation}} of cash crops, labour is the dominant sector in the country's economy. It is a major earner of foreign exchange and the largest employer. Cheap labour {{is one of the}} essential ingredients of its success. Hence these immigrants were bonded and underpaid. In 1921 workers were empowered to break these <b>bonds</b> of <b>indebtedness</b> tying them to the estates. The minimum wages ordinance was extended to plantation labour in 1927 marginally raising the wages that had not changed since the 19th century. This daily wages was 41 Cts. in 1933. Owing to trade union activities it was raised to Rs 17/83 in 1983, Rs 72/24 in 1993 and became Rs 101 in 1998. The wages of female workers was less than males but has been equalized since 1984. Even though there was an increase in wages, the living wages are not sufficient to meet their day-to-day needs. The plantations were nationalized under the 1972 land reform law and its 1975 amendment. The state owned plantations are managed by the Sri Lanka Plantation Corporation and the Janatha Estate Development Board. The nationalization did not result in any basic change on the plantation sector. The state has been forced to take a greater interest in the health, housing and general well-being of the labourers. Hence estate schools were nationalized and brought into the general educational system. With the grant of the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), many schools were built. This helped the slight growth of literacy rates. With the increased unemployment, plantation sector youths looked for other avenues. A considerable number of Indian Tamil girls are employed in garment factories. Some work in the Middle East as housemaids. There is net migration towards urban areas as well as foreign countries. Prior to the commencement of the Sri Lankan civil war many had migrated to the Northern Province. Now the plantation communities have the Plantation Human Development Trust, developed to protect their rights and ensure adequate facilities are provided such as crèches and toilets. Other NGOs work towards the development of the plantation communities such as Shining Life Children's Trust and Hanguranketha Women's Foundation.|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} new public {{domestic}} debt (DD) database covering 93 low-income countries and emerging markets over the 1975 - 2004 period to estimate the growth impact of DD. Moderate levels of non-inflationary DD, {{as a share of}} GDP and bank deposits, are found to exert a positive overall impact on economic growth. Granger-causality regressions suggest support for a variety of channels: improved monetary policy; broader financial market development; strengthened domestic institutions/accountability; and enhanced private savings and financial intermediation. There is some evidence that, above a ratio of 35 % percent of bank deposits, DD begins to undermine growth, lending credence to traditional crowding out and bank efficiency concerns. Importantly, the growth contribution of DD is higher if it is marketable, bears positive real interest rates and is held outside the banking system.

5000|$|Colonel Conn had heavily {{invested}} {{money in}} other businesses. One of his disappointments was {{his involvement with}} early electrical generating systems. In 1904 he constructed a powerhouse and provided electrical service as a competitor to the Indiana and Michigan Electric Company. They later bought out Conn's service at a great sacrifice to himself. The turning point to Conn's financial affairs and public life took place in April 1911 {{when he and his}} wife executed a trust deed for $200,000 covering all their possessions for the purposes of <b>bonding</b> the Conn <b>indebtedness</b> and securing working capital, the longest bond to mature in ten years. Conn's money problems stemmed partly from failed ventures like his entry into the utilities business, the building of his third factory, and its loss to fire, and his loss of a costly lawsuit filed against him by a former company manager. The deed included in addition to the horn factory and what was then known as the Angledile Scale Company, and The Elkhart Truth, some sixty descriptions of real estate in Elkhart and vicinity, various real estate mortgages, 125 shares of stock in the Simplex Motor Car Company of Mishawaka, Indiana, a seagoing yacht, a lake motor launch, and much valuable personal property. Conn also lost considerable face when he was ordered by a judge to publicly apologize for publishing inflammatory comments about J. W. Pepper. The Musical Courier picked up on the legal problems and reported about how Conn was knowingly making false statements about Pepper. In his published apology, Conn attributed his aberrant behavior on an addiction to tobacco.|$|R
