25|$|Despite {{the peace}} process {{launched}} in 2003, sexual assault by soldiers from armed groups and the national army continues in the eastern provinces of the country. Evidence of war rape emerged when United Nations troops move into areas previously ravaged by war after {{the peace process}} started. Gang rape and rape with objects has been reported. The victims of war rape may suffer from incontinence and vaginal fistula {{as a result of}} particularly violent rape. Witness accounts include an instance of a woman who had the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> inserted into her vagina, after which the soldier opened fire. Incontinence and vaginal fistula leads to the isolation of war rape victims from her community and access to reconstructive surgery is limited in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E

25|$|The {{investigation}} into the illegal agents' payments was concluded in the summer, and the club was handed a ten-point deduction for the 2008–09 season on 3 June 2008, along with a £50,000 fine. The club's recent history of administrations meant that the Football League only offered to return the Football League Share to Luton {{on the condition that}} they play with a further twenty-point deduction. Staring down the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun,</b> Luton were forced to start the season with a 30-point penalty, the biggest points deduction ever handed to a club in the top four tiers of English football. Luton beat Scunthorpe United 3–2 in the Football League Trophy final in front of 40,000 of their own supporters at Wembley Stadium, but lost their League status eight days later. On 13 April 2009, Luton Town were finally relegated from the Football League after a spell of 89 years, as Chesterfield held Luton to a draw. Coupled with a victory for Mike Newell's Grimsby Town, this meant Luton's survival in the league became mathematically impossible to achieve.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the First Liberian Civil War, 80,000 {{refugees}} fled neighboring Liberia for the Sierra Leone – Liberian border. This displaced population, composed almost entirely of children, would prove to be an invaluable asset to the invading rebel armies because the refugee and detention centers, populated first by displaced Liberians and later by Sierra Leoneans, helped provide the manpower for the RUF’s insurgency. The RUF took advantage of the refugees, who were abandoned, starving, and in dire need of medical attention, by promising food, shelter, medical care, and looting and mining profits in return for their support. When this method of recruitment failed, as it often did for the RUF, youths were often coerced at the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> to join the ranks of the RUF. After being forced to join, many child soldiers learned that the complete lack of law – as {{a result of}} the civil war – provided a unique opportunity for self-empowerment through violence and thus continued to support the rebel cause.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} wave of raids across Northern Ireland, 342 people were arrested. Many of those arrested {{reported}} that they and their families were assaulted, verbally abused and threatened by the soldiers. There were claims of soldiers smashing their way into houses without warning and firing baton rounds through doors and windows. Many of those arrested also reported being ill-treated during their three-day detention at the holding centres. They complained of being beaten, verbally abused, threatened, harassed by dogs, denied sleep, and starved. Some reported being forced to run a gauntlet of baton-wielding soldiers, being forced to run an 'obstacle course', having their heads forcefully shaved, being kept naked, being burnt with cigarettes, having a sack placed over their heads for long periods, having a rope kept around their necks, having the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> pressed against their heads, being dragged by the hair, being trailed behind armoured vehicles while barefoot, and being tied to armoured trucks as a human shield. Some were hooded, beaten and then thrown from a helicopter. They were told they were hundreds of feet in the air, but were actually only {{a few feet from the}} ground.|$|E

50|$|Almost all long-arms have front grips (forearms) and {{shoulder}} stocks, which provides the user {{the ability to}} hold the firearm more steadily than a handgun. In addition, the long <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> long <b>gun</b> usually provides <b>a</b> longer distance between {{the front and rear}} sights, providing the user with more precision when aiming. The presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stock makes the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> telescopic sight or red dot sight easier than with <b>a</b> hand <b>gun.</b>|$|R
25|$|Sub-caliber {{training}} {{in this context}} refers to attaching a smaller weapon into a bigger one to reduce wear on the actual weapon. In case of 57 55 J the gun, stripped of mounting and most other equipment, was attached into <b>a</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> heavy <b>gun.</b> 57 55 J was located outside the actual gun and fired normal ammo; thus this does not refer to modern sabot ammunition or inner tube mounts.|$|R
500|$|All of the Eon Bond films {{feature the}} unique gun barrel sequence, created by graphic artist Maurice Binder, {{which has been}} called by British media {{historian}} James Chapman [...] "the trademark motif of the series". As Bond walks across the screen, he is viewed by the audience through the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> trained on him by an unknown assailant. Bond wheels around and shoots directly at the gun/viewer, followed by the assassin's blood spilling down the barrel/screen. It was originally filmed in sepia by putting a pinhole camera inside an actual [...]38 calibre gun barrel, with stunt man Bob Simmons playing the part of Bond. The remake of the sequence for the wide-screen Thunderball featured Connery as Bond. This is accompanied by the opening bars of the [...] "James Bond Theme", composed by Monty Norman, orchestrated by trumpeter and composer John Barry and Burt Rhodes.|$|E

Ukraine's then-acting President, Oleksander Turchinov, stated that [...] "The authorities in Crimea are totally illegitimate, both the parliament and the government.

60|$|Ol' Mistah Buzzard, sailing {{round and}} round, {{way up in}} the blue, blue sky, could see {{everything}} going on down below.

60|$|Once upon a time, {{before he}} had grown to think himself so very, very smart, Reddy Fox would never, never have thought of running without {{watching}} out in every direction.

It's my belief that if I took aim at a haystack at thirty yards I'd miss it. No, Vic, I must give up the idea of shooting altogether." ...|$|E
50|$|On 9 March 1997, a 155mm {{artillery}} round {{exploded in}} the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> FH-2000 <b>gun</b> howitzer during <b>a</b> live firing exercise conducted by the 23rd Battalion of Singapore Artillery at the artillery range of Waiouru Army Camp, near Waiouru in New Zealand.

50|$|The {{actual length}} <b>of</b> the <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> long <b>gun</b> are subject various laws in many jurisdictions, for example by the National Firearms Act in the United States, which sets <b>a</b> minimum length <b>of</b> 16 inches (40 cm) for rifle barrels and 18 inches (45 cm) for shotgun barrels. Canada has <b>a</b> limit <b>of</b> 18.5 inches (47 cm) for either. In addition, Canada puts a minimum fireable length for long guns with {{detachable}} or folding stocks of 26 inches (66 cm). In the United States, the minimum length for long guns with detachable or folding stocks is 26 {{in with the}} stock in the extended position.|$|R
60|$|Then my turn came. When {{they were}} not more than fifty yards away from the first wall, I shouted an order to my riflemen to fire, aiming low, and set the example by loosing both <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{elephant}} <b>gun</b> at the thickest of the mob. At that distance even the most inexperienced shots could not miss such a mark, especially as those bullets that went high struck among the oncoming troops behind, or caught the horsemen lifted above their fellows. Indeed, of the first few rounds I {{do not think that}} one was wasted, while often single balls killed or injured several men.|$|R
6000|$|The shop {{seemed to}} him by his Bun Hill {{standards}} extremely roomy, well lit, and unencumbered. There was a long counter to the left of him, with drawers and miscellaneous commodities ranged behind it, a number of chairs, several tables, and two spittoons to the right, various barrels, cheeses, and bacon up the vista, and beyond, a large archway leading to more space. A little group of men was assembled round one of the tables, and a woman of perhaps five-and-thirty leant with her elbows on the counter. All the men were armed with rifles, and the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> peeped above the counter. They were all listening idly, inattentively, to a cheap, metallic-toned gramophone that occupied a table near at hand. From its brazen throat came words that gave Bert a qualm of homesickness, that brought back in his memory a sunlit beach, a group of children, red-painted bicycles, Grubb, and an approaching balloon:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|And as I said [...] "four," [...] a gate clacked-to {{not many}} yards distant and a slow {{footfall}} sounded. Fortunately for me, the path I {{had been following}} skirted {{the other side of}} my haystack. Gathering myself close under the hay, I peeped out. A tall, spare man, in a low, peaked cap and leather leggings, came cautiously swinging along. His face was long, lean, severe. His eyes were fixed in a steady gaze {{as if he were a}} human automaton stalking on. And the black <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> sloped down from under his arm. I drew in closer. His footsteps passed; died away; the evening breeze blew chill. A few moments afterwards a shattering report came echoing on from wood to wood, seeming to knock on my very breastbone. This was no place for me. With one scared glance at the huddling wood, I took to my heels, nor paused until the path through the spinney became so rutted that I was compelled to pick my way.|$|E

5000|$|Binder {{created the}} {{signature}} gun barrel sequence {{for the opening}} titles of the first Bond film, Dr. No (1962).

Unable to stop down the lens <b>of</b> <b>a</b> standard camera enough to bring the entire gun barrel into focus, Binder created a pinhole camera {{to solve the problem}} and the barrel became crystal clear.|$|R
50|$|Break-open {{actions are}} also not as {{inherently}} strong as other action types, rendering them capable of withstanding only relatively low pressures. The action is usually held closed {{by a single}} locking lug, usually below the barrel in a single shot or between the <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> double <b>barreled</b> <b>gun.</b> The single lug must carry all of the force of firing the cartridge. For shotguns, which operate at very low pressures, {{this is not an}} issue.|$|R
6000|$|This {{we looked}} upon with great curiosity {{and not a}} little fear, partly as a man may look in a mirror, partly as he might look into the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> enemy's <b>gun</b> to judge if it be truly aimed.

60|$|The elastic bamboo {{floor of}} the hut bent under the heavy weight of the old seaman, who, {{standing}} within the threshold, tried {{to look into the}} smoky gloom of the low dwelling. Under the torch, thrust into the cleft of a stick, fastened at a right angle to the middle stay of the ridge pole, lay a red patch of light, showing a few shabby mats and a corner of a big wooden chest the rest of which was lost in shadow. In the obscurity of the more remote parts of the house a lance-head, a brass tray hung on the wall, the long <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> leaning against the chest, caught the stray rays of the smoky illumination in trembling gleams that wavered, disappeared, reappeared, went out, came back--as if engaged in a doubtful struggle with the darkness that, lying in wait in distant corners, seemed to dart out viciously towards its feeble enemy. The vast space under the high pitch of the roof was filled with a thick cloud of smoke, whose under-side--level like a ceiling--reflected the light of the swaying dull flame, while at the top it oozed out through the imperfect thatch of dried palm leaves. An indescribable and complicated smell, made up of the exhalation of damp earth below, of the taint of dried fish and of the effluvia of rotting vegetable matter, pervaded the place and caused Lingard to sniff strongly as he strode over, sat on the chest, and, leaning his elbows on his knees, took his head between his hands and stared at the doorway thoughtfully.|$|E
60|$|His {{physical}} vitality--his faculties of free energy, endurance, elasticity--was {{a superb}} endowment to begin with. We may often ask {{for ourselves and}} others: How many of a man's days does he really live? However men may judge the fruit it bore, Mr. Gladstone lived in vigorous activity every day through all his years. Time showed that {{he was born with}} a frame of steel. Though, unlike some men of heroic strength--Napoleon for example--he often knew fatigue and weariness, yet his organs never failed to answer the call of an intense and persistent Will. As we have already seen, in early manhood his eyes gave him much trouble, and he both learned by heart and composed a good deal of verse by way of sparing them. He was a great walker, and at this time he was a sportsman, as his diary has shown. 'My object in shooting, ill as I do it, is the invigorating and cheering exercise, which does so much for health (1842).' One day this year (Sept. 13, '42) while out shooting, the second <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> went off while he was reloading, shattering the forefinger of his left hand. The remains of the finger the surgeons removed. 'I have hardly ever in my life,' he says, 'had to endure serious bodily pain, and this was short.' In 1845, he notes, 'a hard day. What a mercy that my strength, in appearance not remarkable, so little fails me.' In the autumn of 1853 he was able to record, 'Eight or nine days of bed illness, the longest since I had the scarlet fever at nine or ten years old.' It was the same all through. His bodily strength was in fact to prove extraordinary, and was no secondary element in the long and strenuous course now opening before him.|$|E

During filming, some Cuban-Americans objected to the film's Cuban-American characters being portrayed as criminals by non-Cuban-American actors. To counter this, the film features a disclaimer during its credits stating that the film characters were not representative of the Cuban-American community. The entertainment industry initially hated the film, with actress Liza Minnelli asking Pacino what he had done to leave the insiders subdued at a post-screening meal. (Minnelli had not seen the film at the time.) However, during the meal, actor Eddie Murphy told Pacino that he loved the film.|$|R
25|$|The {{inefficiency}} {{was caused}} by the speed with which the uncompressed fissioning uranium expanded and became sub-critical by virtue of decreased density. Despite its inefficiency, this design, because of its shape, was adapted for use in small-diameter, cylindrical artillery shells (a gun-type warhead fired from the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> much larger <b>gun).</b> Such warheads were deployed by the United States until 1992, accounting for <b>a</b> significant fraction <b>of</b> the U-235 in the arsenal, and were some of the first weapons dismantled to comply with treaties limiting warhead numbers.
