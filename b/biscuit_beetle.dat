50|$|The {{drugstore}} beetle (Stegobium paniceum), {{also known as}} the bread beetle or <b>biscuit</b> <b>beetle,</b> is a tiny, brown beetle that can be found infesting a wide variety of dried plant products, where it is among the most common non-weevils to be found. It is {{the only member of the}} monotypic genus Stegobium.|$|E
40|$|<b>Biscuit</b> <b>beetle</b> (Stegobium paniceum) and {{webbing clothes moth}} (Tineola bisselliella) cause {{much damage}} to museum objects. Some objects and {{materials}} are very attractive to these two pest species and objects are often re-infested after treatment. For some years parasitoid wasps {{have been used in}} biological pest control to treat and reduce infestations of stored product pests in food processing facilities. Their application in museums is still new and in a research stage. Results from five different museums in Germany and Austria and their application are presented. Lariophagus distinguendus wasps were released against Stegobium paniceum in the municipal library Augsburger Stadtarchiv (Germany), the Ethnological Museum in Berlin (Germany) and the Picture Gallery in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna (Austria). Trichogramma evanescens were released against Tineola bisselliella in the Technisches Museum in Vienna (Austria) and in the Deutsches Museum Verkehrszentrum in Munich (Germany). Results show that for active <b>biscuit</b> <b>beetle</b> infestations good results can be expected using the Lariophagus distinguendus in museums. Active clothes moth infestations are harder to treat but with a very regular and long-term exposure to the wasps, the clothes moth population can be reduced over the years. We see the application of parasitoid wasps as part of an Integrated Pest Management concept that should be used besides regular insect monitoring and other preventive measures. Difficulties, limitations and research needs in the application of parasitoid wasps in museums are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien {{is one of}} {{the largest}} fine arts {{collections}} worldwide, comprising the Kunsthistorisches Museum, the Austrian Theater Museum, the Museum of Ethnology, all placed in Vienna, and Schlo√ü Ambras in Tirol. We present results from up to 10 years of insect pest monitoring in different collections and the implementation of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) concept. The Kunsthistorisches Museum was the first museum in Vienna to introduce such a concept. We also present specific insect pest problems such as a <b>biscuit</b> <b>beetle</b> (Stegobium paniceum) infestation of paintings lined with starch paste backings (linings) or the webbing clothes moth (Tineola bisselliella) infestation at the Museum of Carriages, both repeatedly occurring problems in the museum. With the help of the insect pest monitoring programs, these and other problems were found and the infested objects treated, usually with anoxia (nitrogen) ...|$|E
50|$|As {{its name}} suggests, the {{drugstore}} beetle {{has a tendency}} to feed on pharmacological products, this is from its preference of dried herbs and plant material sometimes used as drugs, e.g. drugstore beetles have been known to feed on strychnine, a highly toxic herbal extract. It can also feed on a diverse range of dried foods and spices, as well as hair, leather, books, and museum specimens. It can bore into furniture and in some cases tin foil or sheets of lead. The drugstore beetle is also known as the <b>biscuit</b> or bread <b>beetle</b> since it can happily live on biscuit or bread crumbs.|$|R
40|$|Insect pests are {{responsible}} for substantial damage to museum objects, historic books and in buildings like palaces or historic houses. Different wood boring beetles (Anobium punctatum, Hylotrupes bajulus, Lyctus sp. or introduced species), the <b>biscuit</b> <b>beetle</b> (Stegobium paniceum), the cigarette beetle (Lasioderma serricorne), different Dermestides (Attagenus sp., Anthrenus sp., Dermestes sp., Trogoderma sp.), moths like the webbing clothes moth (Tineola bisselliella), Silverfish (Lepisma saccharina) and booklice (Psocoptera) can damage materials, objects or building parts. They {{are the most common}} pests found in collections in central Europe, but most of them are distributed all over the world. In tropical countries, termites, cockroaches and other insect pests are also found and result in even higher damage of wood and paper or are a commune annoyance in buildings. In this short review, an introduction to Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in museums is given, the most valuable collections, preventive measures, monitoring in museums, staff responsible for the IPM and chemical free treatment methods are described. In {{the second part of the}} paper, the most important insect pests occurring in museums, archives, libraries and historic buildings in central Europe are discussed with a description of the materials and object types that are mostly infested and damaged. Some information on their phenology and biology are highlighted as they can be used in the IPM concept against them...|$|E
