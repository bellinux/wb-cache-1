The comparative analysis indicated that the complete genomes of BYDV-GAV showed a low level of genetic diversity with nucleotide sequence identities ranging between 97. 0 % and 99. 7 %, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (ORF 1 + ORF 2) was the most variable within the complete genome. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the BYDV-GAV isolates in Northwestern China could be divided into two groups. In addition, two potential recombination events were detected among the 14 BYDV-GAV isolates.

All of these viruses are obligately aphid transmitted and phloem-limited. The first described YDVs (initially all called BYDV) were classified by their most efficient vector. One of these viruses, BYDV-RMV, is transmitted most efficiently by the corn leaf aphid, Rhopalosiphum maidis. Here we report the complete 5612 nucleotide sequence of the genomic RNA of a Montana isolate of BYDV-RMV (isolate RMV MTFE 87, Genbank accession no. KC 921392). The sequence revealed that BYDV-RMV is a polerovirus, but it is quite distantly related to the CYDVs or WYDV, which are very closely related to each other. Nor is BYDV-RMV closely related to any other particular polerovirus. Depending on the gene that is compared, different poleroviruses (none of them a YDV) share the most sequence similarity to BYDV-RMV. Because of its distant relationship to other YDVs, and because it commonly infects maize via its vector, R. maidis, we propose that BYDV-RMV be renamed Maize <b>yellow</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus-RMV (MYDV-RMV) ...|$|R

We found that perennial grasses contained more tissue carbon than annuals, regardless of fertilization, and fertilized annual grasses increased more in tissue nitrogen than did the perennial grass species.

BYDV isolates from China were generally transmitted {{by more than one}} aphid species except for BYDV-RMV and a few BYDV-PAV. Seven vector trans-mission phenotypes (VTPs) were identified involving five serotypes; BYDV-GAV, BYDV-GPV and BYDV-PAV were predominant in China. Aphid clones differing in virus transmission abilities were occasionally observed for three laboratory-maintained species although they gener-ally showed similar virus transmission profiles. Degener-ate primers similar to Lu 1 and Lu 4 were designed to am-plify coat protein gene fragments from all in the virus col-lection. Serotypes could be distinguished after cleavage of the resulting PCR products with HinfI. Sequence varia-tions among Chinese BYDVs were also deduced from dif-ferences among their restriction patterns. To clarify this, intact coat protein genes of a few isolates were amplified with serotype-specific primers, cloned and sequenced.

40|$|The lack of {{suitable}} {{genes in}} existing wheat germplasm collections makes breeding for specific traits a difficult task. Although tolerance to <b>barley</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>viruses</b> (BYDV) {{has been reported}} in wheat accessions, there are no suitable levels of resistance to BYDV, so genes are sought from wild relatives. The ability for Thinopyrum species to inhibit replication of BYDV makes them attractive sources of resistance for germplasm development. Breeding programs are exploiting Thinopyrum species to develop wheat germplasm resistant to BYDV. The transfer of genes from Thinopyrum into wheat by wide crossing and selecting progeny using molecular markers identified suitable material to some strains of BYDV. The implementation of molecular marker technology has been useful for rapid selection of wheat lines with resistance to some strains of BYDV in a breeding program. However, {{it is now clear that}} Thinopyrum species contain a number of resistance genes on different genomes and homoeologous chromosomes. In order to achieve broad-spectrum resistance to the various serotypes of the BYDV complex it will be best to combine a number of these genes.

5000|$|One {{promising}} {{factor that}} could lead to and be responsible for increased granivore in Agropyron cristatum is a certain genetic difference found on chromosome 6 of plants with a higher granivore content. Plants with a translocation on chromosome 6P yield wheat of greater weight and longer spike length than those without the mutation. Agropyron cristatum possesses higher tiller number, higher floret numbers, and greater resistance to various pathogens such as wheat rusts, powdery mildew, and <b>barley</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>virus</b> than many of its close wheat relatives. It has been used to cross-breed with other species of grass and wheat to transfer a greater disease resistance to them, as well as enhance their properties as a food source. This cross-breeding involves the transferring of the chromosome 6P translocation to the species it is cross-breeding with. Chromosome 6P of A. cristatum has also been proven {{to play an important role}} in regulating fertile tiller number and it possesses positive and negative regulators of tiller number. These regulators were specifically found to be on the 6PS and 6PL chromosome arms. High floret numbers and number of kernals per spike is controlled by genes located on chromosome 6P of Agropyron cristatum. Agropyron cristatum’s genes can be used to instill leaf resistance in other species of wheat. Three backcrosses between Agropyron cristatum and Aegilops tauschii produces a number stable, fertile lines of Aegilops tauschii that then has resistance to leaf rust.

40|$|Community {{assembly}} processes {{may provide}} a predictive framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying disease dilution (reduced disease prevalence with increasing biodiversity). The effect of biodiversity on disease prevalence may depend both on a heterogeneity in host traits related to disease spread and {{on the order of}} species loss in community disassembly. If host communities decay to a predictable subset of hosts, disease prevalence may reflect the competence of the remaining hosts. To test this hypothesis, we measured local host species abundance and prevalence of four generalist aphid-vectored pathogens (<b>barley</b> and cereal <b>yellow</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>viruses,</b> Luteoviridae) in a sentinel ubiquitous annual grass host (Bromus hordeaceus, Poaceae) at 10 sites spanning 2000 km along the North American West Coast. We measured in laboratory and field trials virus infection, as well as aphid vector fecundity and feeding preferences on several host species. Virus prevalence increased as local host richness declined. Grass community disassembly in this system was non-random: hosts from our ubiquitous sentinel species dominating species-poor assemblages were among the most competent for vector production and virus transmission.

Although theory has demonstrated {{a variety of}} mechanisms by which predation and competition in food webs can indirectly control infection risk in hosts, there have until now been no experimental tests of this theory.

We found that pathogen prevalence was ≈ 4 -fold higher in the presence of consumers than in areas where they were excluded. Vertebrate consumers did not directly alter infection rates by this aphid-vectored pathogen group, but rather increased infection risk by increasing the relative abundance of highly-competent hosts in the grassland community. This large-scale experiment, measuring changes in host abundance and infection risk in response to altered consumption rates, confirms theoretical predictions that consumers can indirectly increase infection risk by altering the composition of whole communities. Most importantly, these results demonstrate that, even in complex natural communities, alterations to food web composition such as consumer invasion or extinction can lead to significant impacts that cascade throughout entire communities, including changes in infection risk...|$|R
