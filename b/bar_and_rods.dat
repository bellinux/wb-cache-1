5000|$|Busbars are {{produced}} {{in a variety}} of shapes such as flat strips, solid <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> <b>rods</b> typically copper, brass or aluminium in solid or hollow tubes. Some of these shapes allow heat to dissipate more efficiently due to their high surface area to cross-sectional area ratio. The skin effect makes 50-60 Hz AC busbars more than about 8 mm thickness inefficient, so hollow or flat shapes are prevalent in higher current applications. A hollow section also has higher stiffness than a solid rod of equivalent current-carrying capacity, which allows a greater span between busbar supports in outdoor electrical switchyards.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} common types of cold chisels. These are the flat chisel, {{the most widely}} known type, {{which is used to}} cut <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> <b>rods</b> to reduce {{surfaces}} and to cut sheet metal that is too thick or difficult to cut with tin snips. The cross cut chisel is used for cutting grooves and slots. The blade narrows behind the cutting edge to provide clearance. The round nose chisel is used for cutting semi-circular grooves for oil ways in bearings. The diamond point chisel is used for cleaning out corners or difficult places and pulling over centre punch marks wrongly placed for drilling.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{reorganization}} of the US {{iron and steel industry}} provides a useful setting for an analysis of the relationship between industrial location and institutional forms. Regression analysis shows that institutional shifts in the organization of production dominated geographical shifts in employment and product value as integrated maxi-mills sought to raise productivity. The {{reorganization of}} production includes mill abandonment, increased subcontracting by maxi-mills in the initial stages of production, horizontal penetration by mini-mills in the sheet-steel market, and the growing integration of steel finishing and automobile assembly as firms that belong to Japanese corporate groups expand their operations in the USA. Maxi-mills are concentrating investment and production in the Midwest states as their joint ventures with Japanese steel firms specialize in the mass production of galvanized sheets for the automobile industry. Locational shifts also include the national spread of scrap-processing mini-mills and the rapid decline of raw-steel production in Pittsburgh as maxi-mills close furnaces and mills producing construction-grade <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> <b>rods.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Stress-intensity {{factors and}} load-line {{displacements}} {{were calculated for}} chevron-notched <b>bar</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> fracture specimens using a three-dimensional finite-element analysis. Both specimens were subjected to simulated wedge loading (either uniform applied displacement or uniform applied load). The chevron-notch sides and crack front were assumed to be straight. Crack-length-to-specimen width ratios (a/w) ranged from 0. 4 to 0. 7. The width-to-thickness ratio (w/B) was 1. 45 or 2. The bar specimens had a height-to-width ratio of 0. 435 or 0. 5. Finite-element models were composed of singularity elements around the crack front and 8 -noded isoparametric elements elsewhere. The models had about 11, 000 degrees of freedom. Stress-intensity factors were calculated by using a nodal-force method for distribution along the crack front and by using a compliance method for average values. The stress intensity factors and load-line displacements are presented and compared with experimental solutions from the literature. The stress intensity factors and load-line displacements were about 2. 5 and 5 percent lower than the reported experimental values, respectively...|$|R

50|$|SCOB was amalgamated with IISCO on 1 January 1953. In {{the early}} fifties Tata Iron & Steel Company and IISCO {{were the only}} {{companies}} having integrated steel plants in India. It was estimated by a Technical Mission of the World Bank that steel demand in India would touch 6 million tonnes by 1960. Eugene Black, president of the World Bank, visited India {{in connection with the}} study of the Technical Mission. He also visited Burnpur. The rising demand for steel paved the way for expansion of IISCO. The foreign exchange component of the expansion programme was met with a loan from the World Bank. The expansion programmes were completed in 1956. Two coke oven batteries, two new blast furnaces, each with a capacity of 1,200 tonnes per day, additional open hearth furnaces (taking the total to seven), Morgan continuous billet mill <b>and</b> a continuous <b>bar</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> mill were added along with many auxiliary facilities.

40|$|In $SF_ 6 $-filled {{electrical}} equipment, {{the electric}} field distribution is kept rather uniform. However in practice, the electric {{field in the}} gas gap is distorted by nonuniformities. For this reason, the inhomogeneous field breakdown in $SF_ 6 $ has been extensively studied by various researchers and the breakdown characteristics of compressed $SF_ 6 $ have been reported. Obtaining experimental data under all conditions is not possible. Therefore, an attempt {{has been made in}} the present work to apply an artificial neural network (ANN) to obtain such data. The projection pursuit learning network (PPLN) has been used as the ANN model. Breakdown data for four different voltage waveforms were used to train the network for $SF_ 6 $ pressures of 1 - 5 <b>bar</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> diameters of 1 - 12 mm in a rod-plane geometry.

40|$|Over {{the past}} years {{increased}} numbers of studies about {{the implementation of}} adhesive bonding in timber engineering were published. Current practice is to use two-component (2 K) epoxies and polyurethanes in conjunction with threaded steel bars, reinforced concrete <b>bars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rods</b> made of fibre reinforces polymer. All these material might be considered questionable in terms of sustainable ecology. The current paper investigates the possible substitution of afore mentioned metallic bars by hardwood dowels, and the polymer based adhesives by glutine and casein based ones. It summarises experimental investigations carried out with different geometric parameters, in which beech (a hardwood) rods were glued into spruce (a softwood) blocks. Joint capacities achieved using glutine and casein based adhesives were compared with results using 2 K epoxies and 2 K polyurethane adhesives under dry conditions, and {{under the influence of}} moisture. Results indicate that current glutine and casein adhesives, if used under dry conditions, achieve similar strength; however, that the influence of moisture is still a limiting factor that severely restricts their usage under adverse conditions. The presentation of the results is completed by a numerical modelling of the considered joints, including a methodology to predict their capacity with a reasonable degree of accuracy...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{collaborative}} project {{was to develop a}} standard practice for obtaining and archiving quantitative steel transformation kinetic data and thermal strain data. Two families of dilatometric equipment were employed to develop this standard practice for testing bar product steels. These include high-speed quenching and deformation dilatometers and Gleeble{reg_sign} thermomechanical simulation instruments. Standard measurement, data interpretation and data reporting methods were developed and defined by the cross-industry QMST Consortium members consisting of steel-manufacturers, forgers, heat-treaters, modelers, automotive and heavy vehicle OEMs along with team expert technologists from the National Labs and academia. The team designed phase transformation experiments on two selected steel grades to validate the standard practices [...] a medium carbon grade SAE 1050 and an alloy steel SAE 8620. A final standard practice document was developed based on the two dilatometry methods, and was submitted to and approved by ASTM (available as A 1033 - 04). The standard practice specifies a method for measuring austenite transformation under no elastic stress or plastic deformation. These methods will be an enabler for the development and electronic archiving of a quantitative database for process modeling using computer simulation software, and will greatly assist endusers in developing accurate process and product simulations during the thermo-mechanical processing of <b>bar</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> product steels...|$|R
