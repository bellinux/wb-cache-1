Parts are first manually tacked together in an assembly jig, They are then removed from the jig, rotated horizontally and craned into an automated <b>fastening</b> <b>machine.</b> Finally they are removed from the <b>fastening</b> <b>machines</b> and craned to a third station where the manual tacks are removed and the parts are prepped for final wing box assembly. With the advent of electromagnetic riveting (EMR) and the traveling yoke assembly machine this traditional approach has been replaced with single station processing.

50|$|Most modern <b>belts</b> <b>fasten</b> with a padlock. Some high-security designs nest {{the lock}} within a shroud {{to make it}} more {{difficult}} to attack with bolt cutters. A handful of manufacturers, however, do offer higher-priced models with integral locks for a sleeker profile. These firms include My-Steel, Neosteel, and Latowski in Germany, and Carrara Designs in Belgium. The highly regarded British manufacturer Tollyboy is currently inactive. Metal belts intended for long term wear are made out of medical grade stainless steel or titanium, to reduce the risks of metal allergies and metal toxicity.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, United Airlines {{released}} a bulletin entitled Turbulence Encounter and Passenger Fatality which went into detail the events of Flight 826 and emphasized the importance of effective communication. The airline also took measures to enforce its policy of encouraging passengers to keep their seat <b>belts</b> <b>fastened</b> even if the seat belt sign is off. United Airlines had previously intended to sell the aging aircraft to a salvage company in early 1998. After this incident, the airline opted to retire the aircraft soon afterwards with Flight 826 being the last revenue flight.|$|R

5000|$|Since the 1980s {{and more}} {{commonly}} in the mid-1990s, {{the practice of}} sagging the pants, in which the waistbands (usually secured by a cinched belt) of trousers or (typically long) shorts are worn at or below the hips, thereby exposing the top part of any underwear not obscured by an upper-body garment, has been seen among young men and boys, especially {{among those who are}} consanguine with hip-hop culture and fashion. This practice is sometimes (incorrectly) believed to have originated with prison gangs and the prohibition of belts in prison (due to their use as weapons and as devices for suicide) -- historically, including {{in the latter part of}} the 20th century, gang-affiliated young men and boys were expected to wear their <b>belts</b> <b>fastened</b> tightly.|$|R
25|$|The most {{immediately}} noticeable {{feature is}} a white cassock and zucchetto (skull cap). Only the Pope is permitted to wear a cassock made out of watered silk. The cassock {{used to have a}} train on it, but Pope Pius XII discontinued this custom. For convenience, the train could be folded up and fastened {{to the back of the}} cassock. He used to wear a tufted fascia (white sash-like <b>belt</b> <b>fastened</b> about the waist, the ends of which fall down past the knees and are often embroidered with the Pope's coat of arms), until Paul VI replaced it with a simpler fringed sash. Previously, the tufted fascia (terminating in gold tassels) was worn with choir dress, and the fringed fascia (terminating in a simpler gold fringe) was worn with ordinary dress.|$|R
40|$|New {{turbulence}} prediction {{technology offers}} the potential for advance warning of impending turbulence encounters, thereby allowing necessary cabin preparation time prior to the encounter. The amount of time required for passengers and flight attendants to be securely seated (that is, seated with seat <b>belts</b> <b>fastened)</b> currently is not known. To determine secured seating-based warning times, a consortium of aircraft safety organizations have conducted an experiment involving a series of timed secured seating trials. This demonstrative experiment, conducted on October 1, 2, and 3, 2002, used a full-scale B- 747 wide-body aircraft simulator, human passenger subjects, and supporting staff from six airlines. Active line-qualified flight attendants from three airlines participated in the trials.

Numerous anthropometric and structural measures were taken to highlight and investigate various issues of subjects while simulating operation of the coxswain 2 ̆ 019 s station The experiment was designed to establish the impact of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) on habitability and ergonomics in the coxswain station by examining the anthropometric measures of subjects in various clothing ensembles (i. e. levels of PPE) and how they may impact the performance of tasks associated with normal TEMPSC operation (i. e. fastening seatbelts, interacting with the coxswain 2 ̆ 019 s station, etc.). Select subjects were also examined in the passenger area {{to determine the effect}} of varying levels of PPE on available space (e. g. leg room) and task performance (e. g. seat <b>belt</b> <b>fastening)</b> The {{results of this study suggest}} that PPE, general increase in the size of individuals (due to changing anthropometrics and the requirement of marine abandonment suits), and interior lifeboat design can have a direct impact on the operation and habitability of lifeboats, especially over the long periods of occupancy that are typical of operations in remote northern regions.

40|$|In machine {{assembly}} it {{is often}} required that bolts used to <b>fasten</b> <b>machine</b> parts be installed with specific design preloads. Because it is inconvenient to measure preload directly, preload specifications are usually based on some more easily measured quantity with which the level of preload may be correlated. Most often this quantity is the torque {{to be applied to}} the bolt at installation. Studies by Blake and Kurtz [1] and Heyman [2] have shown that when bolts are torqued into place, the fraction of applied torque which translates into useful preload is small and widely variable. This is so because the large majority of applied torque is absorbed in overcoming friction in the bolt’s threads and at the underside of the bolt’s head. Consequently, even though the torque to install different bolts may be identical, small variations in frictional conditions from one installation to the next can result in large variations in preload. The unreliability of torque as an indicator of preload has been the motivating factor behind the development of a number of alternate methods of measurement [2 – 5]...|$|R
