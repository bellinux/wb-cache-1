50|$|The {{most common}} {{asynchronous}} signalling, asynchronous start-stop signalling, uses a near-constant 'bit' timing (+/- 5% local oscillator required at <b>both</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the connection). Using this, the receiver detects the 'first' edge transition... (the START BIT), then waits 'half a bit duration' then reads A further delay of one 'whole bit duration' is executed {{before the next}} data bit is 'read' - repeating for length of the whole serial word (typically 7/8-data bits).Finally an optional STOP bit is appended to identify the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the data word.|$|R

5|$|Built {{as a local}} station, {{the station}} was {{constructed}} with bellmouth provisions to allow conversion into an express station. A close observation of <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> this station reveals that the tunnel wall extends outward to allow space for the two side platforms to be replaced with island platforms, with the local tracks taking the side platforms' place. The station would have accommodated a major system expansion, with additional service coming from the Roosevelt Avenue Terminal station and the former LIRR Rockaway Line. Requests to convert the station were also put forward by the local community shortly after the station opened, due to heavy bus traffic feeding into the station and overcrowding at the Roosevelt Avenue express stop.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{subsequent}} vowel loss many Mayan languages now show complex consonant clusters at <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> syllables. Following {{the reconstruction}} of Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman, the Proto-Mayan language had the following sounds. It {{has been suggested that}} proto-Mayan was a tonal language, {{based on the fact that}} four different contemporary Mayan languages have tone (Yucatec, Uspantek, San Bartolo Tzotzil and Mocho'), but since these languages each can be shown to have innovated tone in different ways, Campbell considers this unlikely.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, landowners {{along the}} slough had formed three {{drainage}} districts to control floods. They dug ditches, deepened existing water channels, and built levees {{to keep the}} rivers and the slough from flooding agricultural, industrial, and commercial property. Hoping to flush the slough with clean water from the river, city engineers created the crosscutting Peninsula Canal. The project largely failed because daily tides reversed the slough's flow and because <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the canal were at nearly the same elevation.|$|E

It {{is one of}} two through routes for Interstate 35 through the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, the other being Interstate 35W through Minneapolis. Thus, <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> I-35E are shared with I-35W and I-35.

5|$|Limestone traffic {{continued}} on the Tiverton section. Only two boats were working the canal by 1904, {{and the last}} commercial traffic was roadstone from Whipcott quarry to Tiverton, {{where there was a}} crushing plant. Around 7,000tons per year were transported up to 1925. After this the only income was from the washing of sheep, for which a charge was made for every 20 sheep, and the sale of water lilies which grew in the canal. In the 1930s, dams were built at <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> a section near Halberton, where persistent leakage could not be cured.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of present-day}} MD 331 was {{designated}} {{as part of}} US 213 in 1926 when the U.S. Highway System was established. By 1940, US 213 was {{moved to a new}} alignment that crossed the Choptank River at Cambridge on a bridge built in 1935 and MD 331 was designated to run from Vienna to Easton. <b>Both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> MD 331 have been shortened since, with the southernmost portion of MD 331 curtailed following the completion of the US 50 bypass of Vienna by the 1990s and the northern terminus of the route cut back to US 50 in 2004 when the state-maintained portion of Dover Road to Dover Street in Easton was turned over to the city.|$|E

5|$|New York State Route391 (NY391) {{is a short}} {{state highway}} in Erie County, New York, in the United States. The route is signed as north–south; however, it follows more of a southeast–northwest {{alignment}} between NY277 in the hamlet of North Boston and U.S. Route62 (US62) {{in the village of}} Hamburg. NY391 meets the Southern Expressway (US219) just north of North Boston. <b>Both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> NY391 are located in residential areas; however, the middle section of the route passes through more rural areas of the towns of Boston and Hamburg.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Walworth, NY441 becomes Walworth–Penfield Road. Just east of the county line, NY441 shifts {{slightly}} northward by way of an S-curve that serves as a connector between the segmented West Walworth Road, which NY441 intersects at <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the curve. This is the last curve along NY441 as it follows a linear east–west routing over several small hills to a junction with NY350 west of the hamlet of Walworth, where NY441 terminates. The roadway, however, continues east to Marion as Walworth–Penfield Road, Walworth–Marion Road, and Buffalo Street, a continuous highway maintained by Wayne County as County Route205 (CR205) west of Hall Center Road and Maple Avenue and as CR207 east of those roads.|$|E
5|$|The Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} system was retained, having performed better than expected. The wheelchair space was made {{available on the}} end of two mid-train cars, nearest to the lifts in above-ground stations. LED displays that blink to warn passengers of closing doors were introduced in the upper middle section of the door. Additional loudspeakers and advertisement panels were also introduced. Hand grips were moved to the support bars of the seats on the ceiling and grabpoles were located near the doors and at <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> each carriage. The air-conditioning system was modified to match the system used in the C751B cars, with air-conditioning vents and in-flow fans installed.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1890s the Senate {{sent two}} {{engineers}} and Leonard Melán, {{who later became}} the captain of Sampo, to investigate a new icebreaker design that had been developed in the United States in the 1880s and find out its icebreaking capability. Unlike the European icebreakers, the 1888-built train ferry St Ignace had two propellers, one at <b>both</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the ship.

5|$|The final {{assault on}} Jerusalem began on 13 July; Raymond's troops {{attacked}} the south gate {{while the other}} contingents attacked the northern wall. Initially the Provençals at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the northern wall fared better, with a slow but steady attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched at <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the city, and eventually the inner rampart of the northern wall was captured. In the ensuing panic, the defenders abandoned {{the walls of the}} city at both ends, allowing the Crusaders to finally enter.|$|E
5|$|The lack of armour on <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> {{the design}} sparked controversy: after the former Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy Edward James Reed visited the ships under construction, he criticized this {{particular}} design feature, arguing that {{in case of}} damage to either end the entering water would have compromised the stability; the new Italian Minister of the Navy, Simone Pacoret di Saint-Bon, replied during a Parliament session that such an event was very unlikely, as it could happen only if all the bulkeads of the watertight compartments were destroyed.|$|E
