He was the first Eagles player to be inducted. Clarke Hinkle presented him with the honor at the induction ceremony. Van Buren's acceptance speech consisted of four sentences:Thank you Clarke Hinkle, I'm certainly glad to have broken your record. Since you people can't hear too good and I'm not too good a speaker I won't say much, but it's a great honor to be here. The two days I've spent in Canton will certainly <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> every year from now on. Thank you very much.|$|E

500|$|In 1963 Waldron {{had a major}} {{breakdown}} caused by a heroin overdose. He recounted in 1998 {{that a lot of}} musicians in the 1950s and 1960s felt that taking drugs was necessary for career progression. The police assumed they were all doing it, according to Waldron: The police would stop the musicians and search us as we came out of the clubs after work. We had to turn our pockets inside out. After a while, the musicians thought ... well, if you have the name you might as well have the game. Eventually, I overdosed. I couldn't remember my own name. My hands were trembling, I couldn't play the piano. I needed shock treatments and a spinal tap to <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>back.</b> [...] Waldron always felt that he had to return to playing, but this was a slow process. About a year after the overdose, his physical recovery was sufficient to allow him to start relearning his skills, which he did partly by listening to his own records. His recovery as a musician continued for another two years, as his speed of thought was still too slow over that period to allow genuine improvisation: [...] "I worked out my solos in advance and played what I had written out, until gradually all my faculties returned".|$|E

[...] Thinking of her fellow actors, she later urged viewers not to give up on the show: [...] "Do not stop watching All My Children," [...] McClain stated.

2500|$|Paparizou {{made the}} first {{announcement}} of the new album {{in an interview with}} Down Town Magazine in October 2009; at that time three of the tracks on the album had been completed. She stated that she and her team had gathered a lot of material and that she was [...] "very pleased" [...] with the outcome thus far, announcing two of the collaborators: singer-songwriter Giorgos Sabanis and lyricist Giannis Doxas, who is also Paparizou's A; both musicians were on the previous album. Doxas thus far has been confirmed as the lyricist of the tracks [...] "Girna Me Sto Htes" [...] (<b>Bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> to yesterday) and [...] "Thalassa" [...] (Sea), while Sabanis is thus far the composer of all four confirmed tracks. Like the previous album, it was recorded partially in Sweden, where she spent her winter holidays, and also at her professional home studio in Glyfada, Athens. As she had first done on Vrisko To Logo Na Zo, Paparizou contributed musically to the album, having reportedly written the music to one of the songs. Paparizou's fiancé and manager Toni Mavridis composed tracks for the album, as he has done for all of her solo albums, while Dimitris Kontopoulos' inclusion was described as a [...] "surprise," [...] being the first time he has worked with Paparizou since her debut album. Lyricists on the album include Niki Papatheohari who wrote the lyrics to the lead single [...] "An Isouna Agapi", Eleanna Vrahali who had written the lyrics to [...] "Porta Gia Ton Ourano" [...] on the previous album, and Valia Kalantzi. Although Paparizou previously recorded [...] "Papeles Mojados" [...] (wet papers) with Spanish flamenco-electronic group Chambao for her fourth album, that track was re-recorded with vocals from Paparizou rather than an actual collaboration between the two artists, making [...] "Thalassa" [...] her first collaboration to be featured on an album during her solo career and second collaboration overall after [...] "I Zileia Monaxia", a cover of [...] "L'envie d'aimer" [...] with TV presenter Nikos Aliagas, released on his album project Rendez-Vous (2007). In an interview with [...] "Proini Meleti" [...] on Star Channel after a promotional event by Dromos FM, Paparizou stated that the album was dedicated to her late father. She further stated that the album has a more mature feeling to it, as she has matured since her last album, while the producer's of the album are DON-K once again.|$|E
