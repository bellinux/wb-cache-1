5|$|By July 1941, Morshead {{had become}} {{convinced}} that his troops were becoming tired. Their health was deteriorating and, {{in spite of}} his efforts, their morale and discipline were slipping. He informed Generals Blamey and Auchinleck that they should <b>be</b> <b>relieved.</b> Auchinleck arranged for the 18th Infantry Brigade to <b>be</b> <b>relieved</b> by the Polish Carpathian Brigade so that it could rejoin the 7th Division in August but baulked at relieving the 9th Division. At this point, political considerations came into play. The newly installed government of Prime Minister John Curtin in Australia, on Blamey's advice, took up the matter with Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who protested that the relief would cause a postponement of Operation Crusader. As it turned out, the operation had to be postponed anyway. In October 1941, Morshead and most of the 9th Division was replaced by the British 6th Division. The 9th Division moved to Syria to serve as an occupation force, as well as resting, re-equipping and training reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failed}} landing by the Australians at Porton Plantation, the {{commander}} of the Australian II Corps, Savige, decided to focus the main effort of the Australian campaign upon driving south towards the Japanese garrison at Buin, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were holding out. In order to concentrate enough forces for the next phase of the operation, Savige decided that the 11th Brigade, which had been carrying the advance north, should <b>be</b> <b>relieved</b> so that it could be transferred to the south following a period of rest and reorganisation.|$|E

5|$|In January 1863, Burnside {{launched}} a second offensive against Lee, but it {{bogged down in}} winter rains before it accomplished anything and has been derisively called the Mud March. In its wake, he asked that several openly insubordinate officers <b>be</b> <b>relieved</b> of duty and court-martialed; he also offered to resign. Lincoln chose the latter option on January 26 and replaced him with Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, {{one of the officers}} who had conspired against Burnside.|$|E
5|$|In rare cases, beagles {{may develop}} immune {{mediated}} polygenic arthritis (where {{the immune system}} attacks the joints) even at a young age. The symptoms can sometimes <b>be</b> <b>relieved</b> by steroid treatments. Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't have a normal gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A genetic test is available.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring's main {{operational}} task {{during this}} time was {{the support of the}} Condor Legion in the Spanish Civil War. However, his tenure was marred by personal and professional conflicts with his superior, General der Flieger Erhard Milch, and Kesselring asked to <b>be</b> <b>relieved.</b> The head of the Luftwaffe, Hermann Göring, acquiesced and Kesselring became the commander of Air District III in Dresden. On 1 October 1938, he was promoted to General der Flieger (air general) and became commander of Luftflotte 1, based in Berlin.|$|E

The Americans engaged the Japanese force and reported inflicting heavy losses. The arrival of that day of the first units of Brigadier Ivan Dougherty's 21st Infantry Brigade at Nadzab at last allowed the paratroopers to <b>be</b> <b>relieved.</b>|$|E
5|$|On February 10 Matsui {{received}} a messenger from the Army General Staff who informed him, much to Matsui's chagrin and disappointment, {{that he would}} soon <b>be</b> <b>relieved</b> of command and replaced with Shunroku Hata. Ultimately, the Army General Staff did not punish Matsui but they did shake up the whole field command in China and Matsui {{was just one of}} eighty senior officers, including Asaka and Yanagawa, who were all recalled at the same time.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 1835, Texas {{declared}} {{itself an}} independent state, and a provisional government was formed with Henry Smith of Brazoria elected provisional governor. Austin requested to <b>be</b> <b>relieved</b> of his {{command of the}} army, and Sam Houston was named army chief. Edward Burleson was chosen as temporary commander of the troops in San Antonio. Bowie appeared before the council at some point and spoke for an hour, asking for a commission. The council refused Bowie's request, likely because of lingering animosity over his land dealings.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} sustainability fact about bismuth is its byproduct status, which can either improve sustainability (i.e., vanadium or manganese nodules) or, for bismuth from lead ore, constrain it; bismuth is constrained. The {{extent to which}} the constraint on bismuth can <b>be</b> <b>relieved</b> is going to be tested by the future of the lead storage battery, since 90% of the world market for lead is currently in storage batteries for gasoline or diesel-powered motor vehicles.|$|E
5|$|After Chickamauga, Rosecrans and his Army of the Cumberland {{retreated to}} {{fortified}} Chattanooga.

Many of Bragg's subordinates, including Buckner, advocated that Bragg <b>be</b> <b>relieved</b> of command. Thomas L. Connelly, historian of the Army of Tennessee, believes that Buckner {{was the author of}} the anti-Bragg letter sent by the generals to President Jefferson Davis.

5|$|As the {{university}} president, Middleton was constantly involved in personnel decisions, {{some of them}} making national news. One such ordeal occurred in February 1955 when the Board of Supervisors {{decided that it was}} time for the head football coach, Gaynell Tinsley, to <b>be</b> <b>relieved</b> following a break-even record in seven years. His successor, Paul Dietzel, was a 29-year-old assistant coach at the United States Military Academy. Dietzel had a rough beginning at LSU with three losing seasons, and calls for his removal became louder. Middleton supported Dietzel, however, and in his fourth season as coach the LSU Tigers not only had an undefeated season, but also won the Sugar Bowl and were declared the national champions.|$|E
5|$|By 05:50 the {{airborne}} troops had secured {{the area as}} well as the nearby village of Kanne, but they were then subjected to a strong counter-attack which was only repulsed with the aid of air support from Stuka divebombers. The defenders launched several more counter-attacks during the night, ensuring that {{the airborne}} troops could not <b>be</b> <b>relieved</b> until the morning of 11 May. Group Iron suffered the heaviest casualties of all three assault groups assigned to capture the bridges with twenty-two dead and twenty-six wounded. One of the airborne troops assigned to the Group was taken prisoner by the Belgians. He was later freed by German forces at a British prisoner of war camp at Dunkirk.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} Sicily, sixty-five gliders {{released}} too early by the American and British towing aircraft {{crashed into the}} sea, drowning approximately 252 men.

The Italians, having gained control of the bridge, sought to destroy the structure, but were frustrated by troopers of the 1st Airlanding Brigade who had removed the previously attached explosive charges. Other troops from the brigade, who had landed elsewhere in Sicily, aided further by destroying communications links and capturing gun batteries.|$|E

5|$|Inglis {{returned}} to 4th Brigade, now in Italy, in March 1944. For {{much of the}} Italian Campaign the brigade {{did not participate in}} large-scale operations; instead, his armoured regiments were deployed piecemeal in support of infantry operations. In the absence of Inglis while he recovered from his illness the previous three months, Kippenberger had become the preferred acting divisional commander. Kippenberger, commanding the division while Freyberg commanded the New Zealand Corps, was wounded shortly after Inglis arrived in Italy. Command of the division passed to another brigade commander, despite Inglis' seniority. Again overlooked as temporary divisional commander in September, Inglis requested to <b>be</b> <b>relieved</b> of his command and he was promptly sent home to New Zealand. For his wartime services, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E

5|$|There are no {{specific}} rules {{that apply to}} acts or omissions in homicide: an omission is criminal if the defendant fails to prevent the avoidable death of the victim {{where he or she}} has the duty to do so and that the defendant had the capacity to do so.

Like in other areas, a duty of care may now be owed, following R. v Evans, even where the dangerous situation which results in the victim's death was not caused by the defendant.
