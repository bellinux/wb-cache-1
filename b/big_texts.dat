40|$|The present {{contribution}} {{concerns the}} development of a funder repository aiming at the dissemination, reuse and preservation of mainly grey literature material of diverse types. This material which was produced under the auspices of large scale (multi-billion Euros) funding programmes of the Hellenic Ministry of Education (co-financed by the European Union). The project involved the handling {{of a wide range of}} content, like (among others) studies, reports, educational material, videos, theses, material from a range of conferences/events. The project has been successfully completed and the system is publicly available since spring 2011 at [URL] In this repository creation use case, technical enhancements were used to provide the means to organise, process and import to the repository a wide range of heterogeneous material. Special facilities for the support of these workflows were included. The metadata schema used is an application profile using elements for Qualified Dublin core, LOM and PREMIS. A major part of the work concerned mechanisms to enhance presentation of the digital material and better navigation to the corresponding metadata records. Easy browsing to the wide range of the available content was achieved using a tag cloud feature that was developed from scratch for the purposed of the project. The tag cloud was applied to the thematic category data field, which used the EuroVoc thesaurus as a controlled vocabulary for assigning thematic categories to individual items. Regarding digital material presentation, a streaming video player was incorporated into the item pages to enable easy access to the video content and including configuration capabilities that enabled differentiation of the player presentation based on values of specific metadata fields. Regarding text documents, an online reading feature was included in the repository, enabling users to open, read online and search into <b>big</b> <b>texts</b> without the need to save them in their systems - an implementation fully compatible with tablets like iPad and Android-based devices. The infrastructure that enables that is based on transforming documents to JPEG 2000 images, including OCR text for searching, and serving them to users via an extended version of the Internet Archive Book reader using open source and W 3 C standards compatible technologies.

40|$|Abstract—Lexical relations, or {{semantic}} {{relations of}} words, are useful knowledge fundamental to all applications since they help to capture inherent semantic variations of vocabulary in human languages. Discovering such knowledge in a robust way from arbitrary text data {{is a significant}} challenge in <b>big</b> <b>text</b> data mining. In this paper, we propose a novel general probabilistic approach based on random walks on word adjacency graphs to systematically mine two fundamental and complementary lexical relations, i. e., paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations between words from arbitrary text data. We show that representing text data as an adjacency graph opens up many opportunities to define interesting random walks for mining lexical relation patterns, and propose specific random walk algorithms for min-ing paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations. Evaluation results on multiple corpora show that the proposed random walk-based algorithms can discover meaningful paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations of words from text data. I...|$|R

Given the success of deep neural network (DNN) in analyzing big data, this article proposes a novel text classifier using DNN, in an effort to improve the computational performance of addressing <b>big</b> <b>text</b> data with hybrid outliers. Specifically, through the use of denoising autoencoder (DAE) and restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), our proposed method, named denoising deep neural network (DDNN), is able to achieve significant improvement with better performance of antinoise and feature extraction, compared to the traditional text classification algorithms.

30|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that in a single 120  ms fixation, participants can quickly categorize a web page {{into one of the}} ten common categories. Furthermore, it seems that participants are, at least in part, using text in the web pages to do the task. Future work should probe the role of text further, and ask whether participants mainly use text near the point of fixation, or whether they can read (or at least infer category from) <b>bigger</b> <b>text</b> that appears more peripherally. Clearly, however, the content of text is not the whole story; the bulk of the performance is driven by other cues, which most likely include text quantity and font, page layout, organization, and presence and content of images, among other factors. Our current work does not delineate the relative contribution of these cues, and thus a formal investigation of them is an important direction of future work. Furthermore, participants can discriminate pages that contain ads from those that do not, as well as localize elements of the layout, namely the menu bar. Ad detection is more difficult than menu localization, possibly resulting from designers’ different purposes for the two elements. Further research is needed to pin down which menu or ad styles are more visible than others, and why.|$|R

Semantic similarity and clustering can be utilized efficiently for generating effective summary of large text collections. Summarizing large volume of text is a challenging and time consuming problem particularly while considering the semantic similarity computation in summarization process. Summarization of text collection involves intensive text processing and computations to generate the summary. MapReduce is proven state of art technology for handling Big Data. In this paper, a novel framework based on MapReduce technology is proposed for summarizing large text collection. The proposed technique is designed using semantic similarity based clustering and topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for summarizing the large text collection over MapReduce framework. The summarization task is performed in four stages and provides a modular implementation of multiple documents summarization. The presented technique is evaluated in terms of scalability and various text summarization parameters namely, compression ratio, retention ratio, ROUGE and Pyramid score are also measured. The advantages of MapReduce framework are clearly visible from the experiments and it is also demonstrated that MapReduce provides a faster implementation of summarizing large text collections and is a powerful tool in <b>Big</b> <b>Text</b> Data analysis.|$|R

Instead of using the Web as the world's <b>biggest</b> <b>text</b> repository, our process of n-gram collection relies on the Croatian academic online spellchecker Hascheck, a language service publicly available since 1993 and popular worldwide. The service has already processed a corpus whose size exceeds the size of the Croatian web-corpus created in recent years. Contrary to the Google n-gram systems, where cutoff criteria were applied, our n-gram filtering is based on dictionary criteria. This resulted in a system comparable in size to the largest n-gram systems of today. Because of the reliance on a service in constant use, the Croatian n-gram system is a dynamic one, unique among the systems compared. The importance of having an n-gram infrastructure for rapid breakthroughs in new application areas is also exemplified in the paper...|$|R

30|$|The {{analysis}} of the manuscripts which include both traditions reveals two further pieces of evidence. Firstly, the codices’ structures (see Fig.  2) indicate {{a variety of different}} arrangements. We focus primarily on large blocks of <b>text</b> units: the <b>biggest</b> number of <b>texts</b> of the blocks of the Compositiones (Mappæ) tradition varies from 249 (127) texts in the α family to 55 (65) in the β family. Four codices out of six of the α family (S, L, C, and Ob, see Fig.  2) include <b>big</b> blocks of <b>text</b> units from the Compositiones’ tradition (116, 176, 249, 123 texts), and in three cases out of four (L, C, and Ob) the texts of the Compositiones’ blocks overlap those of Mappæ Clavicula, without the two traditions becoming mixed in any way. It seems safe to conclude that the two traditions overlap in many cases of the α tradition. Moreover, {{it must be noted that}} the two Compositiones blocks of the Sélestat codex are practically complementary (see Fig.  2). These features may be rationalised with the deliberate copying of a selection from larger blocks operated by copyists. Nevertheless, the origin of <b>big</b> blocks of <b>texts</b> may also be explained by means of a first stage of aggregation, followed by a successive segregation from a unique source in a quasi-homogeneous state from a source named Mappæ Clavicula text family. However, the latter hypothesis is not statistically plausible.|$|R

The third series of experiments makes an automatic authorship attribution of the two books in a segmental form by employing several classifiers and several types of features. The sizes of the segments are more or less in the same range (four different text segments, with approximately the same size, are extracted from every book). It concerns two different experiments. This investigation sheds light on an old enigma, which has not been solved for 14 centuries: in fact, all the results of this investigation have shown that the two books should have two different authors. ...|$|R

Famous cases of sensitive information leaks caused by insiders, including the WikiLeaks release of diplomatic cables and the Edward Snowden incident, have greatly harmed the U. S. government's relationship with other governments {{and with its}} own citizens. Data Leak Prevention (DLP) is a solution for detecting and preventing information leaks from within an organization's network. However, state-of-art DLP detection models are only able to detect very limited types of sensitive information, and {{research in the field}} has been hindered {{due to the lack of}} available sensitive texts. Many researchers have focused on document-based detection with artificially labeled "confidential documents" for which security labels are assigned to the entire document, when in reality only a portion of the document is sensitive. This type of whole-document based security labeling increases the chances of preventing authorized users from accessing non-sensitive information within sensitive documents.

40|$|Sequences set is a {{mathematical}} model used in many applications. As {{the number of the}} sequences becomes larger, single sequence set model is not appropriate for the rapidly increasing problem sizes. For example, more and more text processing applications separate a single <b>big</b> <b>text</b> file into multiple files before processing. For these applications, the underline mathematical model is multiple sequences sets (MSS). Though there is increasing use of MSS, there is little research on how to process MSS efficiently. To process multiple sequences sets, sequences are first distributed to different sets, and then sequences for each set are processed. Deriving effective algorithm for MSS processing is both interesting and challenging. In this paper, we have defined the cost functions and performance ratio for analysis of the quality of synthesis sequences. Based on these, the problem of Process of Multiple Sequences Sets (PMSS) is formulated. We have first proposed two greedy algorithms for the PMSS problem, which are based on generalization of algorithms for single sequences set. Then based on the analysis of the characteristics of multiple sequences sets, we have proposed the Distribution and Deposition (DDA) algorithm and DDA* algorithm for PMSS problem. In DDA algorithm, the sequences are first distributed to multiple sets according to their alphabet contents; then sequences in each set are deposited by the deposition algorithm. The DDA* algorithm differs from the DDA algorithm in that the DDA* algorithm distributes sequences by clustering based on sequence profiles. Experiments show that DDA and DDA* always output results with smaller costs than other algorithms, and DDA* outperforms DDA in most instances. The DDA and DDA* algorithms are also efficient both in time and space.
