50|$|Eldred's {{company was}} called <b>Breathing</b> <b>Appliances</b> Pty Ltd and located at 70 Abbotsford St., North Melbourne. His {{marketing}} {{was done by}} his friend Bob Wallace-Mitchell. It was difficult for Wallace-Mitchell to market in those early days, as compressed air was not readily available. His first task was to locate a compressor with a sales point {{in each of the}} Australian capital cities. Once this was done, dealers could stock his SCUBA and refill the cylinders. In 1954 Eldred also created the Porpoise Universal, which had a high supply rate of over 300 liters per minute. The Universal used the same demand valve and was modular in design. The reduction valve was a balanced diaphragm type, which was modified to become a piston type. It became his flagship model. Eldred also made a cheaper model, called the Sportsman. The Sportsman was a very compact regulator with innovative features now found on regulators of today. It was made of plastic and had an unbalanced first stage. Market needs made this model necessary, but Eldred did not like it.|$|E
