Carter {{was impressed with the}} story, saying, [...] "Vince had been playing around with somebody finding something in a storage locker. He played around with several different ideas and one day he came in with one idea of a genie and three wishes. The one thing I noticed right away was that the relationship between Mulder and the genie was very sweet." [...] After finalizing his script, Gilligan began to worry that he had [...] "painted himself in a corner": [...] "I did not intend to write a hard episode to direct [...] <b>But</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> realize it, I was blowing up a trailer, having a truck hit an invisible man, and all sorts of genie effects. [...] I looked at all the people on the set [...] and thought, 'Oh man, I'm going to be exposed as an impostor.'" [...] Luckily, the cast and crew helped the new director ease into his position. In addition, many of the members of production noted that the work environment under Gilligan was largely stress-free.|$|E

2500|$|In {{discussing}} the collaborations, Williams {{said it was}} [...] "no problem" [...] {{to connect with the}} featured artists on the album, saying [...] "a phone call was made and we were already cool with one another. It kinda wasn't even a business thing. It was like 'that's my girl', you know, and I personally asked them myself. So that's how that went." [...] She also revealed she was [...] "initially uncertain about boldly referencing Jesus on the project". Whilst {{discussing the}} lyrical content she stated, [...] "at first I was like, 'should I say Jesus', <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> knew it, I couldn't help but to [...] I wasn't going to let anybody stop me from doing that...not that anybody really was, you know?".|$|E

2500|$|During {{the fourth}} round, Ali coasted, keeping his distance. However, when he {{returned}} to his corner, he started complaining that there was something burning in his eyes and he could not see. [...] "I didn't know what the heck was going on", Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer, recalled on an NBC special 25 years later. [...] "He said, 'cut the gloves off. I want to prove to the world there's dirty work afoot.' And I said, 'whoa, whoa, back up baby. C'mon now, this is for the title, this is the big apple. What are you doing? Sit down!' So I get him down, I get the sponge and I pour the water into his eyes trying to cleanse whatever's there, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> did that I put my pinkie in his eye and I put it into my eye. It burned like hell. There was something caustic in both eyes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Haggard {{describes}} {{feeling the}} call of God on his life after {{his first year in}} college, {{while he was in the}} kitchen at home. He had been a telecommunications major with a minor in journalism, but after this experience he believed he had been called to pastor. [...] "I was totally surprised," [...] Haggard wrote in The Life-Giving Church. [...] "I [...] [...] [...] told the Lord I wanted to serve Him. <b>But</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> mentioned this to anyone, especially to my parents, I asked the Lord to assure me by using others to confirm His calling on my life. I felt as though He consented [...] [...] [...]" [...] Within forty-eight hours, Haggard felt that he received four unsolicited confirmations: from a Sunday school teacher, a pastor, a friend, and from his father. Haggard subsequently attended Oral Roberts University, a Christian university in Tulsa, Oklahoma, graduating in 1978.|$|E

60|$|I noted {{to myself}} at the moment, too, that in my heart, though I had seen her <b>but</b> once <b>before,</b> <b>I</b> thought of her already simply as CÃ©sarine. And I {{was pleased to see}} her: fascinated: spell-bound.|$|R
6000|$|The storm {{subsided}} soon; <b>but</b> not <b>before</b> <b>I</b> {{had heard}} the woman say, in a lower, concentrated tone, rather more carrying than her high-pitched railings: [...] "This is the last time. I tell you--the last time. Oh, you WILL understand." ...|$|R
