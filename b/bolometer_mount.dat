40|$|The number {{distribution}} of millimeter-size dust particles in cometary comae {{is difficult to}} establish by optical/IR means alone. However, millimeter wave continuum radio observations are sensitive to these large particles that may control the total dust coma mass. The dust/gas mass ratio derived by combining dust and spectral line observations provides very important and basic information about the physical nature of comets. In late February 1997, FCRAO expanded its intensive comet Hale-Bopp (C/ 1995 O 1) spectral line mapping campaign with a program of millimeter wave bolometry observations of Hale-Bopp's dust coma. The observations were taken with the SuZIE multielement <b>bolometer</b> <b>mounted</b> on the FCRAO 14 m radio telescope. This bolometer is capable of taking data simultaneously at wavelengths of 1. 1, 1. 4, and 2. 1 mm. Initial results from late February 1997 indicate that the equivalent blackbody cross section at 1. 4 mm was (6. 1 +/- 0. 2) x 10 (4) km, implying a dust mass of M = 1. 7 x 10 (12) kg in the coma {{at the time of}} observation, and a dust mass production rate dM/dt = 3. 2 x 10 (5) kg s(- 1). For log[Q(OH) ] = 30. 35, this gives a dust/gas mass ratio of approximately 3. 5. The slope of the continuum emission spectrum corresponds to an opacity index of beta = 1. 36 +/- 0. 30, intermediate between the values of beta for circumstellar dust disks and the ISM. This may be interpreted as a consequence of an evolving dust particle size distribution as the dust grains expanded outwards into the coma of comet Hale-Bopp...|$|R

Combining our results with those obtained by André & Montmerle (1994) for a sample of 21 X-ray selected T Tauri stars (3 additional detections) we improve the statistical significance of our conclusions.

At low frequency, instead, the pulse tube expansioncompression cycles originate lines at 1 Hz and harmonics in the noise spectrum.

40|$|We present 1. 1 mm {{observations}} for {{a sample}} of 16 powerful radio galaxies at 0. 5 <z< 5. 2 and a radio quiet quasar at z= 6. 3, obtained using the AzTEC <b>bolometer</b> array <b>mounted</b> on the ASTE or the JCMT. This paper more than doubles the number of high-z radio galaxies imaged at millimetre/sub-millimetre wavelengths. We detect probable millimetre-wave counterparts for 11 of the active galaxies. The 6 active galaxies which {{do not have a}} probable millimetre counterpart in our images nevertheless have one or more likely associated millimetric source. Thus, we conclude that powerful (radio-loud) active galaxies at high-z are beacons for finding luminous millimetre/sub-millimetre galaxies at high-z. The flux densities of our AzTEC counterparts imply star formation rates ranging from < 200 to ~ 1300 M. /yr. In addition, we find that for the radio galaxoes the 1. 1 mm flux density is anticorrelated with the largest angular size of the radio source. We also present new Spitzer imaging observations of several active galaxies in our sample. Combining these with archival data, we examine the mid-infrared colours of our sample. We find that radio galaxies for which we have detected a probable 1. 1 mm counterpart have mid-infrared colours consistent with dusty starbursts, and are usually bluer than high-z Spitzer-selected active galaxies. In addition, we find arcs of 24 micron sources extending across ~ 200 - 500 kpc, apparently associated with three of the radio galaxies. Comment: 18 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables.

As a continuation and extension of the successful POLARBEAR experimental program, the Simons Array will consist of three cryogenic receivers each featuring multichroic <b>bolometer</b> arrays <b>mounted</b> onto separate 3. 5 m telescopes. The first of these, also called POLARBEAR- 2 A, {{will be the first}} to deploy in late 2016 and has a large diameter focal plane consisting of dual-polarization dichroic pixels sensitive at 95 GHz and 150 GHz. The POLARBEAR- 2 A focal plane will utilize 7, 588 antenna-coupled superconducting transition edge sensor (TES) bolometers read out with SQUID amplifiers using frequency domain multiplexing techniques. The next two receivers that will make up the Simons Array will be nearly identical in overall design but will feature extended frequency capability. The combination of high sensitivity, multichroic frequency coverage and large sky area available from our mid-latitude Chilean observatory will allow Simons Array to produce high quality polarization sky maps over a wide range of angular scales and to separate out the CMB B-modes from other astrophysical sources with high fidelity. After accounting for galactic foreground separation, the Simons Array will detect the primordial gravitational wave B-mode signal to r > 0. 01 with a significance of > 5 σ and will constrain the sum of neutrino masses to 40 meV (1 σ) when cross-correlated with galaxy surveys.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{observations of}} a population of high-redshift, dusty star-forming galaxies: the submillimeter (submm) galaxies. The submm galaxies detected so far are very massive and lumi- nous systems, with huge star-formation-rates (SFR > 100 M yr − 1), large reservoirs of molecular gas (M gas ∼ 1 × 10 10 M) and large dynamical masses (M dyn > 10 10 M). The median redshift of detected submm galaxies is z ∼ 2. 2, which corresponds to a look-back time of 10 Gyr. We have used the LABOCA <b>bolometer</b> camera <b>mounted</b> on the APEX telescope in Chile to search for gravitationally lensed submm galaxies behind massive galaxy clusters (with a total mass M clust > 5 × 10 14 M). The gravitational magnification induced by the galaxy clusters boosts the observed flux densities of the background submm galaxies and allows us to probe deeper into the faint galaxy population. The number counts of submm galaxies show {{that there are many}} more faint galaxies than bright ones, and thus the properties of the bright submm galaxies mainly studied so far may not be representative of the bulk of the population. In two papers we present our results of the observations toward galaxy clusters. In paper I, we discuss a merging galaxy cluster: the Bullet Cluster at redshift z ∼ 0. 3. The huge mass concentration provides large magnification factors, and one of the background galaxies detected with LABOCA is gravitationally magnified ∼ 100 times. The number of galaxies detected toward the Bullet Cluster is consistent with previously published number counts, and we probed the number counts to some of the lowest flux density levels so far. Paper I also includes a study of the multi-wavelength-properties of the LABOCA galaxies, where we identified counterparts in infrared Spitzer maps. In paper II the study of submm galaxies lensed by clusters was extended with four additional clusters. The number of detected galaxies was more than doubled compared to paper I. A more so- phisticated method was used to determine the magnification factors for each galaxy, and to correct the number counts for the effect of magnification differences across the map. The number counts agree with previous work but may indicate a flattening towards low flux densities. A study of the faint, unresolved background population was also included, via the stacking technique. We used the positions of all sources detected in Spitzer 24 μ m maps across the observed LABOCA fields. The LABOCA flux was extracted at each 24 μ m position and when added together this yielded a 14. 5 σ detection, and a signal 5 to 10 times lower than the adopted flux limit for extraction of significant sources in the maps. In combination with gravitational magnification, stacking makes it possible to probe deeper into the submm population, although only mean properties of the faint galaxies can be derived. Having studied the observational properties of a sample of submm galaxies in paper III we focused on one particular galaxy behind the Bullet Cluster, SMMJ 0658, gravitationally magnified up to 100 times in total. The strong lensing caused by the total cluster potential and an elliptical galaxy within the cluster gives rise to three images of the same background galaxy. In our i observations with a radio/mm interferometer, the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), we detected two rotational transitions of the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule in SMMJ 0658. CO is commonly used as a tracer of the more abundant molecule H 2, which constitutes a large fraction of the molecular gas in galaxies. Because of the large magnification factor of this galaxy it is possible to probe the physical conditions in a system with ten times less molecular gas and a lower star formation rate than the bright submm galaxy population studied so far. Finally, I have participated in the APEX-SZ project. APEX-SZ is a bolometer camera oper- ating at 2 mm wavelength, designed with the aim of detecting the Sunyaev–Zeldovich decrement in clusters of galaxies. The Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect is a secondary anisotropy to the Cosmic Mi- crowave Background (CMB) radiation. It is due to inverse Compton scattering of CMB photons by hot electrons in the cluster gas. At 2 mm the SZ effect gives rise to a lower temperature when compared to the 2. 7 K radiation. I participated in six observing runs in Chile between 2008 and 2010. The scientific studies with APEX-SZ focus on the physical state of the intra-cluster gas in galaxy clusters. In two of the papers summarized in this thesis the APEX-SZ detection was used together with XMM-Newton X-ray observations to constrain non-parametric models for the distribution and temperature of the hot gas. The existence of dusty galaxies within high-redshift galaxy clusters is a possible explanation as to why several high-redshift galaxy clusters have eluded detection in Sunyaev–Zeldovich experiments...|$|R
