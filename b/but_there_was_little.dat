Overton attempted to become a naval aviator in 1945 <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> demand for additional aviators at the time, as the war was nearing its end.|$|E
5|$|The new European {{states that}} had {{formed in the}} second half of the 19th century {{typically}} had traditions of war memorials, but nothing on the scale that would later emerge from World War I. Italy built various war memorials after unification in the 1860s, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> agreement about who should be responsible for these within the new Italian state. Romania erected a number of heroically styled memorials after the Romanian War of Independence in 1877 and 1878, usually celebrating famous leaders associated with Romanian independence, but also including the occasional modest local monuments Bulgaria and Serbia constructed many war memorials after the end of the First Balkan War in 1913. The public played little role in these eastern European memorials, however, which were typically constructed by the central state authorities.|$|E
5|$|What came to {{be known}} as the Long Parliament also began to voice vague grievances against Charles, many of which were {{religious}} in nature. Parliament had many Puritans and Puritan-sympathizing members, who generally opposed the existing episcopal system, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> agreement over what shape the church should take. Later in 1640, the Root and Branch petition was presented to the House of Commons, the lower house of Parliament. It was signed by about 15,000 Londoners and called for total elimination of the episcopal system. Committees were organized in the House of Commons to enact religious reforms, leading to the imprisonment of Archbishop Laud and his supporters in the Tower of London as retaliation for their repression of Puritans. The Court of High Commission and the Star Chamber, courts which had inflicted severe punishments on Puritan dissenters, were also abolished.|$|E

50|$|Energy drinks {{have the}} effects {{caffeine}} and sugar provide, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> or {{no evidence that}} the wide variety of other ingredients have any effect. Most of the effects of energy drinks on cognitive performance, such as increased attention and reaction speed, are primarily due to the presence of caffeine. Advertising for energy drinks usually features increased muscle strength and endurance, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> evidence to support this in the scientific literature.|$|R
5|$|Drogba {{suffered}} {{a string of}} injuries {{early on in the}} 2008–09 season and struggled to regain fitness, missing games from August to November due to knee problems. He scored his first goal of the season in mid-November <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> reason to celebrate: he incurred disciplinary action and a three-match ban for throwing a coin back into the stands and Chelsea {{suffered a}} League Cup defeat against Burnley. Drogba scored his second goal of the season in a 2–1 victory against CFR Cluj in the UEFA Champions League, while his first Premier League goal of the season came in a 2–0 win against West Bromwich Albion in late December 2008. Having missed many games through injury and suspension, Drogba had lost his first team place and manager Scolari favoured playing Nicolas Anelka as a lone striker rather than pairing the two. However, he resolved to regain his position in the squad.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, 2002, Los Infernales won the Mexican National Trios Championship from Olímpico, Mr. Niebla and Safari. After {{they won}} the {{championship}} they began feuding with La Familia de Tijuana (Nicho el Millonario, Halloween and Damián 666). The trio lost the title to La Familia on September 27, 2002 but continued feuding into 2003. When Nicho stopped appearing for CMLL the trios championship was vacated but Los Infernales refused to take them without a match. This storyline led to an eight-team trios title tournament whichLos Infernales did not win. Instead Los Infernales did win a tournament to become the number one contenders for the CMLL World Trios Championship but lost to champions Black Tiger III, Dr. Wagner Jr. and Universo 2000 on August 1, 2003. At {{the end of the}} year, Averno and Mephisto turned on Satánico <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> to feuding afterwards they split from the group and ventured out on their own. On February 4, 2004 Mephisto defeated El Satánico to win the CMLL World Welterweight Championship at CMLL’s home at Arena México.|$|E

25|$|The {{earthquake}} of 4 March heavily impacted Bulgaria. The city of Svishtov was {{the most}} affected. Here, three blocks of flats collapsed, killing up to 120 people, among them 27 children. Many other buildings were damaged, including the Church of the Holy Trinity. In Ruse, the tremors were strong <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> damage; only one person perished, hit by a huge architectural ornament that fell down from a nearby building.|$|E
25|$|In 1886, Konstantin {{was furious}} when Alexander III {{restricted}} {{the title of}} Grand Duke to only children and grandchildren of Emperors, as this meant that Konstantin's grandchildren would merely be princes, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> he could do. He had been shunned from society and Alexander III only called his uncle to court for the wedding of Konstantin's eldest granddaughter, Alexandra of Greece to his nephew Grand Duke Paul.|$|E

25|$|The port of Antwerp {{was vital}} to the Allied war effort, and large numbers of AA units were {{deployed}} to defend the approaches up the Scheldt. 120th LAA Regiment remained in the North Scheldt area under 76th AA Bde {{until the end of}} the war. Antwerp itself was heavily bombarded by V-1 flying bombs <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> air activity over the estuary, although 394 Bty fired an emergency barrage on 10 December, destroying one enemy aircraft.|$|E
25|$|With {{competition}} from the railways having taken {{a large share of}} traffic {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, improvements in roads and vehicle technology in the early part of the 20th century meant that the lorry was also becoming a threat to the canals. Tolls had been reduced to compete with the railways, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> scope for further reduction. The Regent's Canal and the Grand Junction Canal agreed that amalgamation and modernisation were the only way to remain competitive.|$|E

25|$|Ava now fully {{expected}} another major invasion. Hsinbyushin had now brought {{most of the}} troops back from Siam to face the Chinese. With the Burmese fully preoccupied with the Chinese threat, the Siamese resistance retook Ayutthaya in 1768 {{and went on to}} reconquer all of their territories throughout 1768 and 1769. For the Burmese, their hard-fought gains of the prior three years (1765–1767) in Siam had gone to waste <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> they could do. The survival of their kingdom was now at stake.|$|E
25|$|As timber {{is a very}} bulky cargo, it {{required}} many ships to carry it from North America to Britain, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> demand for carrying goods on the return voyages. However, there was a market for carrying migrants, {{so many of the}} timber ships turned to the migrant trade to fill their unused capacity. Since timber exports tended to peak {{at the same time as}} conflicts in Europe, a great mass of refugees sought cheap passage across the Atlantic. This created an unprecedented influx of new immigrants in North America.|$|E
25|$|Hindlekar {{died at the}} age of 40 {{for want}} of proper treatment. It was only at a very late stage of his illness that he was moved to the Arthur Road Hospital in Bombay. He was survived by his wife and their seven children. After his death the BCCI and Bombay Cricket Association issued appeals for {{contributions}} to help his family, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> response. The Bombay Port Trust then organised a cabaret dance on 6 August 1949 which raised a little over Rs.7,000. Almost every major Indian cricketer of the time attended the dance.|$|E

25|$|David Gower {{took over}} as skipper in 1984 and led the team to a 2–1 victory over India. They {{went on to win}} the 1985 Ashes 3–1, {{although}} after this came a poor run of form. Defeat to the West Indies dented the team's confidence, and they went on to lose to India 2–0. In 1986 Mickey Stewert was appointed the first full-time England coach. England beat New Zealand, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> hope of them retaining the Ashes in 1986/87. However, despite being described as a team that 'can't bat, can't bowl and can't field', they {{went on to win the}} series 2–1.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 19th century, Boston {{became a}} haven for Irish Catholic immigrants, {{especially}} following the potato famine of 1845–49. Their arrival transformed Boston from a singular, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant city to one that has progressively become more diverse. The Yankees hired Irish as workers and servants, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> social interaction. In the 1850s, an anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant movement was directed against the Irish, called the Know Nothing Party. But in the 1860s, many Irish immigrants joined the Union ranks {{to fight in the}} American Civil War, and that display of patriotism and valor began to soften the harsh sentiments of Yankees about the Irish.|$|E
25|$|In 1868 Cox and Bloomfield applied {{under the}} {{conditions}} of the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1868 for their runs Woodlands, Miriam Vale and Polmaily to be consolidated as the Miriam Vale run and Silex, Ilex and Gochen to be consolidated as Bulburan. Miriam Vale was divided into resumed and leasehold sections in 1869/70, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> demand to open this land for selection. Some Miriam Vale land had been taken up as freehold by 1884. In January 1875 a telegraph office was opened at Miriam Vale, and a post office was established there in April 1877, reflecting a population increase in the district.|$|E
