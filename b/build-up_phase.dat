Additionally we examined how their training methods correspond with the relevant research. We collected information about the usage of interval training, continuous running, uphill running, and strength exercise during the week throughout the seasonal training phases. Ten Spanish coaches, chosen according to their athletes' performance in International Events, {{took part in the}} present investigation. Interval running at 75 - 85 % of (V) over dot O- 2 max and repeated running up to 85 % of (V) over dot O- 2 max are mostly used in the <b>build-up</b> <b>phases</b> and less in the pre-competitive and competitive phases, whereas interval running at 85 - 95 % of (V) over dot O- 2 max, repeated running above 85 % of (V) over dot O- 2 max, and interval sprinting were mainly used in the pre-competitive followed by the competitive phase. Fartlek training and low and moderate intensity continuous running proved to be the most popular methods of continuous running throughout all the training phases, while high and low-high intensity running were mainly used during the pre-competitive and competitive phases. Continuous and interval uphill running is mostly used in the special phase and in a lesser amount in the basic and pre-competitive phases. Circuit training and resistance exercise are used mainly in <b>build-up</b> <b>phases.</b> Plyometrics and resistance running are used in a very small amount in all training phases.

Birdsong {{is a prime example}} of acoustically {{sophisticated}} vocal behaviour, but its complexity has evolved mainly through sexual selection to attract mates and repel sexual rivals. In contrast, non-human primate calls often mediate complex social interactions, but are generally regarded as acoustically simple. Here, we examine arguably the most complex call in great ape vocal communication, the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) ‘pant hoot’. This signal consists of four acoustically distinct phases: introduction, build-up, climax and let-down. We applied state-of-the-art Support Vector Machines (SVM) methodology to pant hoots produced by wild male chimpanzees of Budongo Forest, Uganda. We found that caller identity was apparent in all four phases, but most strongly in the low-amplitude introduction and high-amplitude climax phases. Age was mainly correlated with the low-amplitude introduction and <b>build-up</b> <b>phases,</b> dominance rank (i. e. social status) with the high-amplitude climax phase, and context (reflecting activity of the caller) with the low-amplitude let-down phase. We conclude that the complex acoustic structure of chimpanzee pant hoots is linked to a range of socially relevant information in the different phases of the call, reflecting the complex nature of chimpanzee social lives.

50|$|One {{critique}} of the <b>Build-up</b> <b>Phase</b> data and predictions is {{that there needs to}} be better error descriptions. The global estimate of rainfall indicates that the confidence range is large relative to possible trends. The number of ground sensing stations (currently around 40) in the BSRN is rather limited for global observation this affected the measurement of aerosols which are regionally dominant. The best measurements of aerosol pollution are obtained when cloud types are identified properly by satellite observation, therefore better cloud sensing strategies and models are need to provide the clearest real time data. Certain projects like GCIP allow have focused on continental scale observations provide better prediction for project areas; however, areas outside these project areas may lag in receiving forecasting improvements. Many of the deficiencies in Phase I are improvement areas within the objectives of Phase II of the project. Currently scientist use NASA Aqua's Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) to evaluation soil moisture from space.

Indications to SLIT include allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, and isolated conjunctivitis (strength of recommendation: grade A). As to severity of the disease, SLIT is indicated in moderate/severe intermittent rhinitis, persistent rhinitis and mild to moderate asthma (grade D). SLIT may be safely prescribed also in children aged three to five years (grade B), and its use in subjects aged more than 60 years is not prevented when the indications and contraindication are ascertained (grade D). The choice of the allergen to be employed for SLIT should be made in accordance with the combination of clinical history and results of skin prick tests (grade D). Polysensitisation, i. e. the occurrence of multiple positive response does not exclude SLIT, which may be done with the clinically most important allergens (grade D).

50|$|A drama unfolds through {{episodes in}} which {{characters}} interact. The episode {{is a period}} of preplay communication between characters who, after communicating, act as players in a game that's constructed through the dialogue between them. The action that follows the episode is the playing out of this game; it sets up the next episode. Most drama-theoretic terminology is derived from a theatrical model applied to real life interactions; thus, an episode goes through phases of scene-setting, build-up, climax and decision. This is followed by denouement, which is the action that sets up the next episode. The term 'drama theory' and the use of theatrical terminology is justified {{by the fact that the}} theory applies to stage plays and fictional plots as well as to politics, war, business, personal and community relations, psychology, history and other kinds of human interaction. It was applied to help with the structuring of Prisoner's Dilemma, a West End play by David Edgar about the problems of peace-keeping. In the <b>build-up</b> <b>phase</b> of an episode, the characters exchange ideas and opinions in some form or another and try to advocate their preferred position - the game outcome that they are hoping to see realised. The position each character takes may be influenced by others' positions. Each character also presents a fallback or stated intention. This is the action (i.e., individual strategy) a character says it will implement if current positions and stated intentions do not change. Taken together, the stated intentions form what is called a threatened future if they contradict some character's position; if they do not - i.e., if they implement every position - they form what is called an agreement.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} phenomena of eutrophication in shallow coastal waters is the mass accumulation of macroalgae. These macroalgal blooms {{have a negative effect on}} the functioning of the ecosystem, fisheries activities and tourism. This thesis focuses on the regulation of seasonal and spatial dynamics of blooms of Ulva cf. scandinavica Bliding in the Veerse Meer, a eutrophic, brackish lake in the SW Netherlands. Studies have been performed on biomass dynamics, winter survival, taxonomy, auto-ecology and dynamics and regulation of macroalgal mats. The annual dynamics of Ulva biomass development in the Veerse Meer is described in conceptual model. Four phases are distinguished in the bloom: a dormant phase, a <b>build-up</b> <b>phase,</b> a stationary phase and a degradation phase. Algal fragments survive through the winter in the sediment. Probably, wind-induced currents cause the release of the algae from the sediment, thereby triggering the transition from the dormant to the <b>build-up</b> <b>phase,</b> however, further research is required. Light is the main factor regulating growth during the <b>build-up</b> <b>phase.</b> Only after a prolonged period of clear weather, nitrogen becomes growth limiting. Self-shading in the mats increases during the <b>build-up</b> <b>phase,</b> eventually causing the shift of the <b>build-up</b> <b>phase</b> to a more or less stationary phase. A high biomass can be maintained during this phase due to nutrient (mainly nitrogen) recycling in the mat. Finally, the degradation phase starts, during which biomass again decreases to winter levels. Management measures, aiming to decrease the macroalgal biomass development in the Veerse Meer, should be primarily directed to a decrease in nitrogen load. For a further recovery of the ecosystem of the lake, a more natural tidal regime is requested. Additionally, harvesting of algal mats during summer and of fragments in the sediment during winter will bring some relie...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to explore}} how {{relational}} constructs (total interdependence, trust, commitment, cooperative norms and conflict) impact the buyer's relationship satisfaction across the relationship lifecycle. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected through mail survey from a sample of 162 Australian buyers. Confirmatory factor {{analysis was used to}} purify the measurement scales and multiple regression analysis techniques using dummy variables were used to test the hypotheses. Findings – The results indicate that interdependence and trust are associated with higher relationship satisfaction in the <b>build-up</b> and maturity <b>phases</b> while commitment is associated with higher relationship satisfaction in the maturity phase. Unexpectedly, cooperative norms are found to drive relationship satisfaction in both the <b>build-up</b> and maturity <b>phases.</b> Conflict, however, is not found to affect relationship satisfaction in the decline/deterioration phase. Research limitations/implications – A limitation of this study is the unequal sample size in each of the relationship phases. It would be desirable to run a model consisting of the five relational constructs {{for each of the three}} phases. Originality/value – Literature has suggested that the effects of relational constructs on outcomes vary across relationship phases.

40|$|An {{improved}} timing scheme {{has been}} conceived for {{operation of a}} scanning satellite-borne rain-measuring radar system. The scheme allows a real-time-generated solution, which is required for auto targeting. The current timing scheme used in radar satellites involves pre-computing a solution that allows the instrument to catch all transmitted pulses without transmitting and receiving at the same time. Satellite altitude requires many pulses in flight at any time, and the timing solution to prevent transmit and receive operations from colliding is usually found iteratively. The proposed satellite has {{a large number of}} scanning beams each with a different range to target and few pulses per beam. Furthermore, the satellite will be self-targeting, so the selection of which beams are used will change from sweep to sweep. The proposed timing solution guarantees no echo collisions, can be generated using simple FPGA-based hardware in real time, and can be mathematically shown to deliver the maximum number of pulses per second, given the timing constraints. The timing solution is computed every sweep, and consists of three phases: (1) a <b>build-up</b> <b>phase,</b> (2) a feedback phase, and (3) a build-down phase. Before the <b>build-up</b> <b>phase</b> can begin, the beams to be transmitted are sorted in numerical order. The numerical order of the beams is also the order from shortest range to longest range. Sorting the list guarantees no pulse collisions. The <b>build-up</b> <b>phase</b> begins by transmitting the first pulse from the first beam on the list. Transmission of this pulse starts a delay counter, which stores the beam number and the time delay {{to the beginning of the}} receive window for that beam. The timing generator waits just long enough to complete the transmit pulse plus one receive window, then sends out the second pulse. The second pulse starts a second delay counter, which stores its beam number and time delay. This process continues until an output from the first timer indicates there is less than one transmit pulse width until the start of the next receive event. This blocks future transmit pulses in the <b>build-up</b> <b>phase.</b> The feedback phase begins with the first timer paying off and starting the first receive window. When the first receive window is complete, the timing generator transmits the next beam from the list. When the second timer pays off, the second receive event is started. Following the second receive event, the timing generator will transmit the next beam on the list and start an additional timer. The timers work in a circular buffer fashion so there only need to be enough to cover the maximum number of echoes in flight...|$|E

The Candy Wrapper velocity model introduced here accounts for a dynamic picture of the inner core (i. e., the eastward drift of material), where different iron crystal shapes can be stabilized at the two hemispheres.

40|$|Abstract Background Vasogenic edema {{dynamically}} accumulates in many brain disorders {{associated with}} brain inflammation, with the critical step of edema exacerbation feared in patient care. Water entrance through blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening {{is thought to}} have a role in edema formation. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of edema resolution remain poorly understood. Because the water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP 4) provides an important route for vasogenic edema resolution, we studied the time course of AQP 4 expression to better understand its potential effect in countering the exacerbation of vasogenic edema. Methods Focal inflammation was induced in the rat brain by a lysolecithin injection and was evaluated at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 20 days using a combination of in vivo MRI with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements used as a marker of water content, and molecular and histological approaches for the quantification of AQP 4 expression. Markers of active inflammation (macrophages, BBB permeability, and interleukin- 1 β) and markers of scarring (gliosis) were also quantified. Results This animal model of brain inflammation demonstrated two phases of edema development: an initial edema <b>build-up</b> <b>phase</b> during active inflammation that peaked after 3 days (ADC increase) was followed by an edema resolution phase that lasted from 7 to 20 days post injection (ADC decrease) and was accompanied by glial scar formation. A moderate upregulation in AQP 4 was observed during the <b>build-up</b> <b>phase,</b> but a much stronger transcriptional and translational level of AQP 4 expression was observed during the secondary edema resolution phase. Conclusions We conclude that a time lag in AQP 4 expression occurs such that the more significant upregulation was achieved only after a delay period. This change in AQP 4 expression appears to act as an important determinant in the exacerbation of edema, considering that AQP 4 expression is insufficient to counter the water influx during the <b>build-up</b> <b>phase,</b> while the second more pronounced but delayed upregulation is involved in the resolution phase. A better pathophysiological understanding of edema exacerbation, which is observed in many clinical situations, is crucial in pursuing new therapeutic strategies. </p...|$|E

To this end, we created recordings of actors once in a search situation and once committing a mock crime (theft or bomb placing) in a public crowded area. For ecological validation, we used authentic CCTV footage of real crimes in Experiment I. In this experiment, the two behavioral clusters pattern of movement in space and nonverbal communication behavior were analyzed. The results showed a deviance in pattern of movement in space for offenders' compared with the nonoffenders' condition {{as well as a}} bystanders' baseline.

40|$|Initially after catastrophic {{disturbance}} ecosystems {{undergo a}} <b>build-up</b> <b>phase</b> {{but in the}} long term absence of catastrophic disturbance ecosystems can enter a phase of decline called ecosystem retrogression. It is characterised by reduced productivity, decomposition rates and rates of nutrient cycling as a consequence of nutrient limitation. Over the course of long-term soil development, phosphorus (P) availability decreases due to leaching and chemical immobilisation, leading to increased soil N: P ratios during retrogression. In contrast, nitrogen (N) is continuously supplied to natural ecosystems through biological N 2 fixation, though late successional plant species can {{have a negative effect on}} N availability during retrogression, reinforcing N limitation. I studied variation in supply and availability of N and P throughout a 5000 year retrogressive chronosequence in which the soil N: P ratio increases, and investigated how it affected the nutrient status of soil microbes and plants. I found that total N increases considerably during retrogression as a consequence of increased N 2 fixation. Total P did not change across the chronosequence but labile mineral P declined in the retrogressive stage and this was connected to decreased soil microbial activity. Plant nutrient status showed diverging trends between trees and dwarf shrubs across the chronosequence, indicating increasing resource partitioning as retrogression proceeds. Variation in leaf traits was due to shifting species composition rather than within species changes. I also studied factors influencing the availability of N and P during the <b>build-up</b> <b>phase</b> of succession as affected by an important extrinsic driver, i. e., herbivory. Herbivory of a N 2 fixing shrub had considerable negative effects on the nutrient status of not only its own growth and nutrient status, but also that of neighbouring non-fixing plants and soil processes. These studies in combination have demonstrated how changing availability of nutrients during succession, both in the <b>build-up</b> <b>phase</b> and the retrogressive phase, can be driven by biological processes such as N 2 fixation and species effects on carbon (C) quality and, how this in turn leads to differences in the relative success of coexisting plant species in the community.

40|$|Solid phase {{reactions}} are easily automated and can therefore contribute substantially {{to the number}} of compounds required by the high throughput screening (HTS) which {{is an important part of}} modern drug discovery methods. In contrast to the synthesis of organic compounds in solution there were at the beginning of the project only a small number of generally applicable solid phase reactions. It was the task of the joint project to adapt together with all consortium members typical examples of organic reactions to solid phase synthesis. A list of organic standard reactions was created which was cooperatively processed by the partners. The results of the evaluations were regularly communicated and have led to a fast <b>build-up</b> of solid <b>phase</b> chemistry know-how as a basis for the efficient synthesis of compounds in the research departments of the consortium members.

40|$|The pick-up {{rates of}} tick species by various {{resistant}} groups of animals, dipped {{once a month}} and not dipped were investigated under ranch conditions in Nabiswera, Luwero district, Uganda. During {{the first three weeks}} of exposure of cattle to natural tick infestation, two <b>phases</b> of tick <b>build-up</b> and one <b>phase</b> of decline in tick population were demonstrated with R. appendiculatus. The other tick species were too few for comparisons to be made. Each of these phases lasted about 7 days, except on animals dipped once a month where the phase of decline in tick population lasted only 3 days. These fluctuations in pick-up rates were attributed to differences between drop-off rhythms of engorged female ticks and reinfestation pressure of unfed ticks. The peak numbers of R. appendiculatus were determined by the carrying capacity of the ears of animals. After three weeks of exposure, the population of R. appendiculatus on cattle stabilized and this could be due to the attainment of an equilibrium balance between drop-off rhythms and reinfestations. The pick-up rates were highest on the low resistance (LR) groups of animals, followed by the medium resistance (MR) and was lowest on the high resistance groups (HR). These patterns of tick infestation were identical in both treatment groups of animals. The significance of using pick-up rates of ticks for differentiating the levels of host resistance in cattle are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} solar jet {{phenomenon}} associated with successive flares on November 10 th 2014. These explosive events {{were involved with}} the satellite spots' emergence around a delta-type sunspot in the decaying active region NOAA 12205. The data of this jet was provided by Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO), X-Ray Telescope (XRT) aboard Hinode, Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and Domeless Solar Telescope (DST) at Hida Observatory, Kyoto University. These plentiful data enabled us to present this series of papers to discuss the entire processes of the observed phenomena including the energy storage, event trigger, and energy release. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} energy <b>build-up</b> and trigger <b>phases,</b> by analyzing the photospheric horizontal flow field around the active region with an optical flow method. The analysis reveals the following three. (i) The observed explosive phenomena involved three satellite spots, the magnetic fluxes of which successively reconnected with their pre-existing ambient fields. (ii) All of these satellite spots emerged in the moat region of a pivotal delta-type sunspot, especially near its convergent boundary with the neighboring supergranules or moat regions of adjacent sunspots. (iii) Around the jet ejection site, the positive polarities of satellite spot and adjacent emerging flux encountered the global magnetic field with negative polarity in the moat region of the pivotal delta-type sunspot, and thus the polarity inversion line was formed along the convergent boundary of the photospheric horizontal flow channels.
