25|$|Evan-Thomas {{continued}} {{to suffer from}} illness while in the Mediterranean, and in 1894 received sick leave to return to England. While he was indeed ill, the leave was also granted {{to allow him to}} formally propose to and marry Hilda Barnard, who he had intended to marry immediately before his unexpected posting to the Mediterranean. The wedding took place on 18 July 1894 at St. Saviours Church, Walton Place, Knightsbridge. In November the couple moved to Valletta on Malta where the fleet was based. Social life on Malta remained impressive, with royalty and other dignitaries stopping at Malta and being entertained at Admiralty House. Evan-Thomas' term in the Mediterranean ceased in December 1896. Culme-Seymour wrote that 'he has great tact and judgement - a thorough knowledge of his duties (signal and otherwise) and both with the fleet in the summer at sea and on shore in Malta has <b>been</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> I could wish'. On 1 January 1897 he was promoted to commander.|$|E
500|$|A {{third and}} final album was again helmed by David Kahne, which Allmusic writer Stewart Mason speculated was a [...] "reaction against the more {{commercial}} sound of Benefactor. By this time, Carter {{had been replaced by}} veteran session drummer Aaron Smith. Instincts was released in October 1984, debuted at No.68 on the Billboard 200, and proved to be the band's best-selling album. It also launched their most successful single, [...] "A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)," [...] which broke the Billboard Top 40 and peaked at No.35. Critical reactions were positive. Despite being the band's most successful effort to date, Columbia pulled the band's promotional support while on a nationwide tour. [...] "The very next town we got to after they made that decision, there wasn't an A person there," [...] said Iyall. [...] " [...] was no local person there, there were no interviews and in-stores arranged as they had <b>been.</b> <b>All</b> <b>that</b> just ground to a halt." [...] Iyall also revealed during that tour that she had signed with her own manager, David Rubinson, and would be leaving the band {{at the end of the}} tour. The band stayed together for a European tour at the beginning of 1985 and upon returning to San Francisco, Iyall quit the band to pursue a solo career. Constant touring has been cited by Iyall as the primary reason for the break-up. [...] "You get tired of each other, and you get intolerant of being uncomfortable and away from your family and your friends." [...] According to a VH1 reunion episode, the issue of Iyall's weight was the reason for the label dropping them. In 2003, Iyall agreed with this claim: [...] "Howie sold us from 415 to Columbia Records, and they were like 'Who's this fat chick?' They decided that was as far as it was going to get, and pulled their support." [...] Crawdaddy! writer Denise Sullivan stated that the label spoke to Iyall about losing weight, but she subsequently refused. In 2010, Iyall declined to discuss the issue, but added that she may not be taking full responsibility in the matter.|$|E

Though she readily accepts his word when he says he did not, she does not think the [...] "good life" [...] they had together has <b>been</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> it could be. Still, Nancy remains loyal to Charlie. While she threatens to have adventures on her own, she does nothing about it.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1961 season, Mantle and {{teammate}} Roger Maris, {{known as}} the M Boys, chased Babe Ruth's 1927 single-season home run record. Five years earlier, in 1956, Mantle had challenged Ruth's record {{for most of the}} season, and the New York press had been protective of Ruth on that occasion also. When Mantle finally fell short, finishing with 52, {{there seemed to be a}} collective sigh of relief from the New York traditionalists. Nor had the New York press <b>been</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> kind to Mantle in his early years with the team: he struck out frequently, was injury-prone, was a [...] "true hick" [...] from Oklahoma, and was perceived as being distinctly inferior to his predecessor in center field, Joe DiMaggio.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Gurewitz {{reunited with}} Graffin to co-write a song together, called [...] "Believe It", which would appear on their next album, The New America (2000). For it, Todd Rundgren, an early musical {{inspiration}} for Graffin, {{was brought in}} to produce. [...] "Todd was kind of an underground sensation back in 1974. Here's a guy who was making pop music but in a way that you wouldn't hear on the radio. So much of my early musical identity was wrapped up in the way he conducted himself." [...] In the summer of 2000, they set out on a 3-month U.S. arena tour opening for Blink-182. Unfortunately, the experience might not have <b>been</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> Greg {{and the rest of the}} band might have hoped. Interest in recording the record waned, due to Rundgren's poor attitude. Jay Bentley reflects on this by saying, [...] "I didn't feel we were going anywhere and so did Greg. Todd didn't like Greg and that made Greg so mad! He met his idol and he was a jerk! I don't think Todd gave a shit about anything." [...] However, Graffin later writes in his book, Anarchy Evolution, that although Todd Rundgren was difficult to work with, he and Graffin are friends to this day. Meanwhile, Bobby Schayer left the band following a serious shoulder injury and was replaced by Brooks Wackerman (Suicidal Tendencies).|$|E
