30|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the anaerobic degradation, an exactly defined amount of the substance is incubated together with sludge inoculum at 35 ± 1 °C. The sludge inoculum consists of digested sludge to which a certain amount of raw sludge (raw sludge is usually a mixture of 40 % sludge from the pre-sedimentation and 60 % sludge from the final sedimentation in WWTPs) has been added in order to “vitalize” it, i.e. to obtain a basic sludge gas development. The addition of raw sludge is part of the original DIN 38414, part 8, and when we started to evaluate the suitability of this method for determining the <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> <b>surfactants,</b> we kept this step, as a basic sludge gas development allows to observe possible inhibitory effects caused by the test substances.|$|E

The factors that limit the use of microbial surfactants in environmental technologies are discussed. Thus, at certain concentrations biosurfactant can exhibit antimicrobial properties and inhibit microorganisms destructing xenobiotics.

Development of effective technologies using microbial surfactants should include the following steps: monitoring of contaminated sites to determine the nature of pollution and analysis of the autochthonous microbiota; determining the mode of surfactant introduction (exogenous addition of stimulation of surfactant synthesis by autochthonous microbiota); establishing an optimal concentration of surfactant to prevent exhibition of antimicrobial properties and rapid biodegradation; research both in laboratory and field conditions...|$|E
30|$|A {{new test}} method {{suited for the}} {{assessment}} <b>of</b> the anaerobic <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> <b>surfactant</b> under sewage plant simulation conditions is proposed.

30|$|For the {{evaluation}} of the aerobic degradability several standardized screening tests (e.g. OECD 301 A-F for ultimate degradability, respectively OECD 302 A-C for inherent degradability) as well as some simulation tests (e.g. OECD 303 A-C and OECD 314) are available. In contrast, for {{the evaluation}} of the ultimate degradability under anaerobic conditions, the number of test methods is much lower. Two screening tests are available (OECD 311, ISO 11734), which are characterized by a low microbial density (a small inoculum) {{and the fact that the}} test substance is the only carbon source, i.e. the test conditions are stringent but not necessary realistic with regard to the fate <b>of</b> chemicals like <b>surfactants.</b> In addition, there are indications that the reproducibility of the anaerobic screening tests is poor [2]. The only simulation test, which has been standardized just recently at OECD level, is the OECD 314, part C [6]. OECD 314, part C assesses the <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> organic substances by anaerobic digester sludge. This test, however, requires 14 C] labeled test substances, which clearly limits the scope of the test.

40|$|Surfactant {{enhanced}} bioremediation (SEB) of oil is {{an approach}} adopted {{to overcome the}} bioavailability constraints encountered in biotransformation of nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) pollutants. Fuel oils contain n-alkanes and other aliphatic hydrocarbons, monoaromatics, and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Although hydrocarbon degrading cultures are abundant in nature, complete biodegradation of oil is rarely achieved even under favorable environmental conditions due to the structural complexity of oil and culture specificities. Moreover, the interaction among cultures in a consortium, substrate interaction effects during the degradation and ability of specific cultures to alter the bioavailability of oil invariably affect the process. Although SEB {{has the potential to}} increase the degradation rate of oil and its constituents, there are numerous challenges in the successful application of this technology. Success is dependent on the choice of appropriate surfactant type and dose since the surfactant-hydrocarbon-microorganism interaction may be unique to each scenario. Surfactants not only enhance the uptake of constituents through micellar solubilization and emulsification but can also alter microbial cell surface characteristics. Moreover, hydrocarbons partitioned in micelles may not be readily bioavailable depending on the microorganism-surfactant interactions. Surfactant toxicity and inherent <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> <b>surfactants</b> may pose additional challenges as discussed in this review...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of various surfactants on the biological activity {{of a mixed}} aerobic culture has been investigated by using flow microcalorimetry. The response of the culture to the addition of homologous n-alkylcarboxylates (C 2 to C 16) and n-alkylpyridinium bromides (C 11 to C 14) has been examined under endogenous and substrate saturation conditions, and inhibitory concentrations (MIC or the concentration which decreased the initial activity (heat flux) of the culture by 50 %) were determined for each state. Under both conditions, the n-alkylpyridinium bromides {{were found to be}} more toxic than the n-alkylcarboxylates of identical chain length, thus confirming that the head group of the amphiphiles {{plays an important role in}} the microbial toxicity of surfactants. The relationship observed between the concentration at which 50 % of the activity is lost and the chain length of the surfactant further confirms that cellular toxicity is also dependent on surfactant hydrophobicity. In relation to the <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> <b>surfactants</b> in mixed aerobic cultures, the low concentration effects of n-alkylcarboxylates on endogenous culture were investigated in some detail.

The gas law is then used to convert the net gas volume into the molar gas amount, taking pressure and temperature into account. The degree of degradation of the test substance is then determined by the rule of three from the measured molar gas amount and the organic carbon provided by the test substance and used in the test.|$|E

As the most promising basis the test method according to DIN 38414, part 8, was chosen. Although the AnBUSDiC test is more tolerant to high surfactant concentrations, the substance concentration has to be a compromise between the limit of detection (sufficient discrimination between the test sample and the blank sample) and toxicity inhibition (It is well known from the ECETOC test, that higher concentrations <b>of</b> <b>surfactants</b> can be toxic for the sludge microorganisms [8]). However, the higher inoculum concentration, named as dry residue, in the AnBUSDiC test seem to “buffer” to some extent the toxicity, so that compared to the conditions in the ECETOC test, generally higher surfactant concentrations are tolerated. For surfactants a test substance concentration of 200 – 800 mg active substance per liter seems to be a good choice for the 1 st addition (i.e. 150 - 500 mg TOC/per liter). For non toxic compounds, even higher test substance concentrations may be appropriate.|$|R

The experimental outcomes could be fit well with the first-order biodegradation kinetics model. It was observed that the <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> these <b>surfactants</b> decreased {{with an increase in}} the chain length of the hydrophilic moiety <b>of</b> the <b>surfactant.</b> When surfactant concentrations initially present were less than 250 mg carbon/L, <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> Tergitol 15 -S-X surfactants is around 0. 3.

30|$|Surfactants are {{chemicals}} {{with a high}} {{production volume}} and a wide dispersive use, i.e. surfactants have a high environmental impact. The question of the persistence of a particular substance {{is one of the}} most important aspects for the assessment of the risks associated with chemical substances (EU Technical Guidance Document, 2003). Therefore, strict legal requirements for the aerobic <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> <b>surfactants</b> have been established on national and international level, e.g. the EU Detergent Regulation (EC/ 648 / 2004). The most common fate for surfactants is that they are discharged via waste water. Surfactant containing domestic and industrial waste water is collected and purified in professionally operated waste water treatment plants. Taking into account the strict legal requirements assuring the use of biodegradable surfactants, the vast majority of surfactant molecules entering a waste water treatment plant (WWTP) are readily broken down to CO 2 and H 2 O. Only a very small fraction of the surfactants is not aerobically broken down during the usual hydraulic retention times of modern WWTPs. This fraction, due to the predominantly hydrophobic nature of surfactants, adheres to the sludge. The sludge is usually collected and further treated under anaerobic conditions in digester tanks. Therefore, the knowledge about anaerobic biodegradability under digester tank conditions is important to gain an understanding about the environmental fate of surfactants. Unfortunately, no standard method is available to test surfactants under these conditions.|$|E

40|$|The {{biological}} treatment of metalworking fluids (MWFs) is a cost effective alternative to conventional waste disposal processes. While research has proven {{that this process}} is capable of treating large volumes of wastes with high organic concentrations, there are uncertainties about the mechanisms by which the treatment occurs, and there are limitations that must be overcome. There {{is a need to}} understand the importance of the mechanisms by which carbon (and hence COD) is removed from the wastewater. This will allow for waste practitioners to make better decisions for optimizing the process, and for disposing of waste (i. e sludge) that is generated. The {{biological treatment}} process is also susceptible to biocides present within formulations. These compounds either need to be removed before the treatment process, or the bioreactors need to be made more resistant to them to ensure that their presence does not hinder the reactor functioning. This study aims to answer the uncertainties about the carbon removal mechanisms involved in the treatment of oil-containing MWFs. In the first experimental chapter, it is shown that the predominant mechanism of carbon removal is oil/water separation induced by emulsifier degradation, and hence the bioprocess treatment rate is significantly affected by the <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> <b>surfactants</b> and by the presence of cations found naturally in the water that used to prepare the emulsions. The study then provides insights into the potential that coagulation and coalescence has for removing inhibitory components commonly found in MWFs. Coagulation and coalescence is shown to effectively remove biocides with low aqueous solubility (iodopropynyl butylcarbamate) and those that partition themselves into the oil phase (o-phenyl phenate and its sodium salt). Finally, to improve the resistance of reactors to inhibitory compounds, factors influencing the development of fixed-film reactors are investigated. A micro-cosmic system is used to study the both physico-chemical effects and nutritional factors on the development of biofilm reactors. It is shown that biofilm yields can be controlled through pH adjustment, and that these yields are maximized with phosphate stimulation and ammonium limitation. It is then shown that fixed-film reactors are able to treat metalworking fluids even under conditions deemed to be inhibitory. In summary, this project provides insights into further understanding and enhancing the biological treatment of MWFs. </p...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Düşük köpürme özelliğine sahip, soğuk suda iyi çözünebilen ve bu özellikleri nedeniyle düşük konsantrasyonlarda bile etkili olan noniyonik yüzey aktif maddeler çok geniş bir kullanım alanına sahiptirler. Noniyonik yüzey aktif maddelerden nonil fenol etoksilatlar kısa süre öncesine kadar yüzey aktif madde pazarının % 80 ‘ini oluşturan türler olarak bu pazarda ciddi bir paya sahiptiler. Sucul ortamda yarattıkları olumsuz etkiler anlaşılana kadar nonil fenol etoksilatlar kağıt, tekstil, deri, gıda, boya gibi bir çok endüstriyi kapsayan geniş bir yelpazede yaygın olarak kullanılmaktaydılar. Ancak 1990 ‘lı yılların başlarında endokrin bozucu ve toksik etkilerinin fark edilmesinin ardından nonil fenol etoksilatların yerine kullanılabilecek başka bir noniyonik yüzey aktif madde arayışına girilmiştir. Gelinen bu aşamada birinci alternatif olarak toksik etkileri bilinmeyen, yüksek biyolojik bozunurluğa sahip ve yüzey aktif madde olarak uygulamada nonil fenol etoksilatları ikame edebilecek nonil alkol etoksilatlar görülmektedir. Bahsedilen özellikleri nedeniyle nonil alkol etoksilatların üretimleri ve kullanımları gün geçtikçe artmakta ve yaygınlaşmaktadır. Her ne kadar bilinen herhangi toksik, kanserojenik veya mutajenik etkiye sahip olmasalar da, giderek artan miktarda üretilen ve kullanılan alkol etoksilatların arıtılabilirliklerinin araştırılması ihtiyacı doğmuştur. Literatürde alkol etoksilatların biyolojik olarak arıtılabilirlikleri ile ilgili gün geçtikçe artan sayıda araştırma yer almasına karşın söz konusu yüzey aktif maddelerin fiziko-kimyasal, elektrokimyasal ve fotokimyasal arıtılabilirlikleri ile ilgili sınırlı ve yetersiz sayıda araştırma mevcuttur. Bu çalışmanın amacı alkol etoksilatlara örnek teşkil etmek üzere seçilen polioksietilen (4) loril eter (Brij 30) ‘in 20 mg/L konsantrasyonundaki sulu çözeltilerinin koagülasyon, elektrokoagülsyon ve TiO 2 /UV-A fotokatalitik oksidasyon prosesleri esas alınarak fizikokimyasal ve kimyasal yöntemler ile arıtılabilirliğinin incelenmesi ve maksimum Brij 30 ve organik madde (TOK) giderimini sağlayacak en uygun proses reaksiyon koşullarının belirlenmesidir. Yukarıda belirtilen amaç doğrultusunda yürütülen deneysel çalışmadan elde edilen sonuçlar koagülasyon-flokülasyon ve çelik elektrotların kullanıldığı elektrokoagülasyon proseslerinin gerek Brij 30 gerekse organik madde gideriminde istenilen verimi sağlamadığını göstermiştir. İki farklı TiO 2 katalizörü kullanılarak yürütülen fotokatalitik oksidasyon deneylerinde Aeroxide PF 2 heterojen katalizörü ile yine istenilen düzeyde giderme verimleri elde edilememiştir. Buna karşılık Degussa P 25 TiO 2 heterojen katalizörü kullanılarak yürütülen fotokatalitik oksidasyon denemelerinde uygun reaksiyon koşulları seçildiğinde gerek Brij 30 ‘un tamamı giderilmiş, gerekse % 90 civarında organik madde minerilizasyonu gerçekleştirilmiştir.

Nonionic {{surfactants}} {{have low}} foaming properties, are highly soluble {{in cold water}} and are effective even in very low concentrations in water. Because of these advanteges, nonionic surfactants are widely used surface active substances especially in the industries such as leather, food, pulp and paper, cosmetics etc. Nonylphenol ethoxylates which used to dominate the surfactant market with a consumption rate of 80 %, {{have been the most}} preferred nonionic surface active compound. Nonylphenol ethoxylates are functionally used as cleaning and washing agents, surface active agents and foaming agents. The industrial activities use nonylphenol ethoxylates for industrial and institutional cleaning, textile auxiliaries, leather auxiliaries, emulsion polymerization, agricultural pesticides, cosmetics, cleaning products and office products such as correction fluids and ink. In early 90 ‘s the toxic and endocrine distrupting effects of nonylphenol ethoxylates in the aquatic environment have been revealed. Nonylphenol, a breakdown product of nonylphenol ethoxylates, has been shown to mimic the action of the female hormone oestrogen. Concerns have focused on the potential for nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates to cause feminisation in wildlife, such as fish exposed to nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates contaminated effluents, as well as being a potential factor in the increasing incidence of reproductive organ disorders and decreasing sperm counts in men. Whereas nonylphenol ethoxylates is reasonably readily degradable, its breakdown product nonylphenol is more persistent. It has been determined that these compouns exhibit the estrogenetic activity by mimicing the hormones mentioned. Especially in the aquatic environment, fishes are the most affected organisms. It is known that nonylphenol ethoxylates are also very slowly biodegredable and have bioaccumulating property. After realizing the adverse effects of nonylphenol ethoxylates in the environment, espacially in aquatic environment, several countries have been taken act by regulations restricting production and consumption of nonylphenol ethoxylates. It was necessary to replace nonylphenol ethoxylates with another nonionic surface active agent. At this point alcohol ethoxylates seem to be the most appropriate alternative due to it‘s high biodegredability, low toxicity, high water solubility and surface active effectiveness. Alcohol ethoxylates are the second largest group of surfactants in terms of manufacture (after linear alkylbenzenesulphonates) and the main group of non-ionic surfactants. The main area of alcohol ethoxylate application is in the manufacture of washing powders, liquids etc. Alchol ethoxylates are classifed as easily biodegradable surfactants, in contrast to previously used oxyethylated alkylphenols or oxyethylene-oxypropylene block copolymers. xviii However, the massive stream of alcohol ethoxylates directed into sewage systems and then to sewage treatment, is required strict control in order to prevent pollution of the aquatic environment. A very important chain in this control is the examination of the <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> <b>surfactants</b> prior to their uses in washing powder formulations. After replacing nonylphenol ethoxylates, production and consumption of alcohol ethoxylates have rapidly increased. This progression brought on the requirement of knowlege on the treatability, biodegradability and toxicity properties of alcohol ethoxylates. There are several research on the biodegradability of nonyl alcohol ethoxylates, however there are very little information about the chemical treatablity of these compounds. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the treatability of alcohol ethoxylates in aqueous solutions by coagulation, electrocoagulation and TiO 2 /UV-A photocatalitic oxidation processes and to determine the optimum process conditions for the most effective treatment process. As a model nonyl alcohol ethoxylate compound poly(oxyethylene) (4) loryl ether, Brij 30 was selected to be used in the experiments. This study consists of seven chapters. In the first chapter, the purpose and scope of the study was described briefly. In the second chapter, classification of surfactants, properties of surfactants, a brief explanation about toxicity of nonylphenol ethoxyltes, properties of alcohol ethoxylates and treatability of alcohol ethoxylates were defined. In the third chapter, fundamentals of coagulation and electrocoagulation were defined. Basic chemicals‘ reactions which occur during these processes were explained. In the fourth chapter, photochemical oxidation process was described, the fundamentals and basic reactions were explained. The factors which effecting photocatalitic activity were also explained in the end of the chapter. In the fifth chapter, the materials and methods were introduced which were used during the experimental part of the thesis. Since three different processed were used, three different treatment methods were explained. These processes were: classical coagulation-floculation process, electrocoagulation process and TiO 2 catalized photocatalitic oxidation process. For every process the same analytical analysis were applied to the sampes in order to follow the treatment efficiency such as colourimetric surfactant determination and TOC analysis. In the sixth chapter all of the experimental results were evaluated and discussed. In the last chapter of the study the results were briefly evaluated and the most important results were stressed by the explanation of importance. In this experimental study, three different chemical treatment alternatives were evaluated and it was determined that only one of them was suitable to treat model pollutant, Brij 30 compound from its aqueos solution. The first alternative was classical coagulation-flocculation process derived in different coagulant (FeCl 3) concentrations varing between 100 and 1000 mg/L, in pH 6. 5 and 20 mg/L Brij 30 concentration. In this process the least Brij 30 removal was observed with 25 % Brij 30 removal in 100 mg/L FeCl 3 dosage and the highest Brij 30 removal efficiency was achieved with 39 % in 750 mg/L FeCl 3 dosage. These results showed that coagulation-floculation process was not practical for removing Brij 30 from its aqueous solution. xix The second process was electrocoagulation process using stainless steel electrodes and NaCl as electrolyte. Electrocoagulation experiments were conducted at original pH of 20 mg/L Brij 30 solution (~ 6), various NaCl concentrations (500, 1000, 1500, 2000 mg NaCl/L) and two different current densities (9, 3 and 18, 6 mA/cm 2). When experimental results were evaluated; in 500 mg/L NaCl concentration, current density of 18, 6 mA/cm 2 after 180 minutes 70 % of Brij 30 removal was achieved. In the coagulation-flocultion experiments there was no significant removal result neighter in Brij 30 nor in TOC. The last but the most effective process was photocalalytic oxidation using TiO 2 as catalyst under UV-A radiation. In this experiments firstly two different TiO 2 types (Degussa P 25 and Aeroxide P 2) were compared and it was proved that Degussa P 25 was significantly more effective than Aeroxide P 2 in removing Brij 30 and TOC. The experiments were conducted in 20 mg/L Brij 30 concentrations, in two different pH (original pH ~ 6 and pH= 3) to determine the effect of initial pH, in two different TiO 2 concentrations (1 and 1. 5 g/L) to determine the effect of TiO 2 dosages and for the selected test periods (5, 10, 15, 60, 240, 480 minutes). The aim of experiments were to determine the optimum process terms. In these experiments that in the original pH of 20 mg/L Brij 30 solution (~ 6) and 1 g/L Degussa P 25 TiO 2 dosage after 15 minutes more than 96 % Brij 30 removal was obtained. Under these experimental conditions only after 240 minutes 64 % TOC removal was achieved. After increasing the Degussa P 25 TiO 2 dosage to 1. 5 g/L, after 480 minutes of photocatalitic oxidation TOC removal increased to 86 %. In general after decreasing the pH to 3 resulted in decreases the Brij 30 removal efficiencies. The experimental results showed that coagulation-floculation and electrocoagulation processes were not suitable effective treatment methods in removing Brij 30 from aqueous solutions. Additionally very limited organic matter removal efficiencies in terms of TOC could be obtained by appliying these processes. The most effective process was photocatalitic oxidation under UV-A radiation from the three different processes. By using photocatalitic oxidation it is possible to remove practically all of the model pollutant and most of the TOC from the water under mentioned conditions. Even in short reaction periods (15 minutes) high rates of Brij 30 removals are achieved but longer experiment periods (240 - 480 minutes) are needed in order to reach significant TOC removals.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of ozonation of aqueous solutions <b>of</b> non-ionic <b>surfactants</b> {{was investigated in}} this study. The research was conducted using solutions of amine oxide based surfactants. These surfactants constitute a particular class <b>of</b> non-ionic <b>surfactants</b> that exhibit cationic behaviour in acid solution, they show good foaming properties and are skin compatible. The ozonation process was carried out at 25 °C in a stirred tank reactor for 30 min, where gaseous ozone was bubbled. The degree of mineralization achieved after the ozonation process was evaluated by measuring the total organic carbon before and after ozonation. The influence <b>of</b> ozonation on <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> the solutions was studied using the biodegradation test by Pseudomonas putida. Biodegradation efficiency of the ozonated amine oxides based surfactants was also evaluated. It {{was found that the}} effectiveness of ozonation depended on the chemical structure <b>of</b> <b>surfactant</b> molecule.

30|$|Surfactants {{are widely}} used across the globe in both {{industrial}} and consumer products, so their biodegradation characteristics are therefore of high importance. The <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> a substance is a key parameter when considering the environmental implications of its use [1]. The fate <b>of</b> most <b>surfactants</b> is to be discharged in wastewater, usually entering a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Upon entering a WWTP a fraction <b>of</b> the <b>surfactants,</b> due to their surface-active nature, is adsorbed to the primary sludge. The remainder is almost completely mineralized to CO 2 and H 2 O in the aerator. The sludge containing the non-degraded surfactants is then further treated in anaerobic digester tanks. Currently, scientifically appropriate simulation methods for the analysis <b>of</b> <b>surfactants</b> in anaerobic conditions within a WWTP (OECD 314 [2]) require radiolabeled test substances, which limit the scope of such a method.|$|R

40|$|The {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>biodegradability</b> or non-biodegradability {{are highly}} {{important for the}} design and application of sustainable materials. The objective of this work is to introduce a novel type of nanocomposite comprising a natural fibre reinforcing agent impregnated with copper nanoparticles, and to control the <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> this sustainable material using {{the function of the}} impregnated copper nanoparticles. At room temperature, copper nanoparticles were synthesized and impregnated into palm oil fibre to improve the strength and durability of the fibre and the material properties of the composite. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic techniques were used to characterize the prepared composites. The biodegradability (minimum to maximum boundary) of the composite was studied (using the soil burial test) {{as a function of the}} quantity of copper nanoparticles, where the tensile strength was fixed at the maximum. The property <b>of</b> <b>biodegradability</b> was also optimized with the help of response surface methodology. The <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> the developed composites ranged from 26. 72 to 6. 51 % when the concentration of impregnated copper nanoparticles was varied from 0 to 2590 μg g− 1 respectively. The results indicate that copper nanoparticles can be considered as a potential biocide in composite materials and in this work for controlling the <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> the material by varying the quantity of impregnated copper. The relationship between the responses and variables selected in this study has been justified by the predicted models. Moreover, the model terms have been explained and the prediction has also been performed successfully. Thus, copper nanoparticles have been successfully applied for controlling the <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> the nanocomposite materials.

The {{results showed that}} the <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> the Egyptian-villages sewage (73 %) was higher than that of the cities (66 %). The higher <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> the soluble COD of village sewage (69 %) as compared to that of the cities (46 %) was the reason for the higher <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> the total COD of the villages sewage. The <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> suspended COD was similar for the sewage of both villages and cities (73 - 74 %). The results of a mathematical-model, developed based on anaerobic digestion model number 1, indicate that at applying a UASB reactor for the treatment of Egyptian villages and cities sewage, an optimum HRT of, respectively, 16 and 8 h is required. At these HRTs, a total COD removal and a conversion to methane of, respectively, 62 - 70 % and 59 - 64 % can be achieved for the sewage of cities and, respectively, 71 - 77 % and 67 - 69 % for the villages sewage. The model results also show that in the treatment of villages sewage in a two-step (anaerobic filter + UASB reactor) system a higher total COD removal can be obtained (77 - 81 %) at a short HRT of 10 h (4 + 6 h).
