500|$|... "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone noted [...] "the album de-emphasizes the (very) guilty pop pleasures of her 2004 debut {{in favor of}} leaden I-hate-you-Daddy laments such as [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart" [...] and [...] "My Innocence". Entertainment Weekly writer Leah Greenblatt commented that [...] "it's {{hard to imagine a}} more explicit snapshot of the highly publicized family problems that have plagued the star than [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)"". PopMatters's Whitney Strub said [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] "immediately commences with a line about 'wait for the postman to <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> letter', which suggests songwriters dipping into the well of cliché without worrying about freshness," [...] while commenting that [...] "the world might not need another version of Britney Spears' 'E-Mail My Heart', but good lord, that song came out in 1999. Perhaps a text-message might arrive faster than snail-mail in late 2005, should Lohan's song-persona deign to enter the 21st century".|$|E

2500|$|Fourteen {{songs were}} recorded, but only ten songs were included. The songs [...] "My New School," [...] "Unicorn Blood," [...] "Touch the Brains," [...] and [...] "Maybe Kreacher Will <b>Bring</b> <b>Me</b> <b>a</b> Sandwich" [...] were later {{released}} on the compilation album Priori Incantatem.

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, Fitzhugh Lee was sending {{his old friend}} and classmate taunting {{messages}} across the river. One of the more challenging messages said [...] "I wish you would put up your sword, leave my state, and go home. You ride a good horse, I ride a better. If you won't go home, return my visit, and <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> sack of coffee.".|$|E

2500|$|Diane Sawyer interviewed O'Donnell in a March 14, 2002, {{episode of}} PrimeTime Thursday. O'Donnell told USA Today that {{she chose to}} talk to Sawyer because she wanted an investigative piece on Florida's ban on gay adoption. She told Sawyer if that was done, [...] "I {{would like to talk}} about my life and how (the case) {{pertains}} to me." [...] She spoke about the two gay men in Florida who faced having a foster child they raised removed from their home. State law wouldn't let them adopt because Florida banned gay or bisexual people from adopting. O'Donnell's coming out drew criticism from some LGBT activists who cited her repeated references to being enamored of Tom Cruise on The Rosie O'Donnell Show as deceptive. She responded in her act stating, [...] "I said I wanted him to mow my lawn and <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lemonade. I never said I wanted to blow him." [...] After leaving her show and coming out, O'Donnell returned to stand-up comedy, and cut her hair. O'Donnell told the press that her haircut was meant to mimic the haircut of former Culture Club backup singer Helen Terry.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I see {{the dining-room}} of my club, and myself {{seated at a}} little table by the window looking out on Piccadilly. And there's a spotless table-cloth, and all the {{accessories}} are spick and span.
