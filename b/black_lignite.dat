6000|$|The {{numerous}} {{islands of}} this group, {{with the exception}} of Lemus, Ypun, consist of metamorphic schists; these two islands are formed of softish grey and brown, fusible, often laminated sandstones, containing a few pebbles, fragments of <b>black</b> <b>lignite,</b> and numerous mammillated concretions of hard calcareous sandstone. Out of these concretions at Ypun (latitude 40 degrees 30 minutes S.), I extracted the four following extinct species of shells:-- ...|$|E

The amounts of a metal leached by the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) in dependence on pH of the extraction reagent differ for the studied metals and fly ashes types...|$|R
50|$|Amur Oblast has {{considerable}} {{reserves of}} {{many types of}} mineral resources; proven reserves {{are estimated to be}} worth US$400 billion. Among the most important are gold (the largest reserves in Russia), silver, titanium, molybdenum, tungsten, copper, and tin. <b>Black</b> coal and <b>lignite</b> reserves are estimated to be seventy billion tons. Probable iron deposits are estimated to be 3.8 billion tons. The Garin deposit is fully explored and known to contain 389 million tons of iron ore. Estimated reserves of the deposit are 1,293 million tons. The deposit's ore contains a low concentration of detrimental impurities; the ore contains 69.9% iron. Amur Oblast is also a promising source of titanium, with the Bolshoy Seyim deposit being the most important.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBio-liquefaction of coal is a {{potential}} technology of converting solid coal to liquid fuel/chemicals at ambient condition. Our previous research has successfully isolated one fungus called AH from Chinese mine environment to liquefy Chinese lignite. To help understand bio-liquefaction of Chinese lignite, this paper focused on characterization of fungus AH and bio-liquefaction products. Results showed that during bio-liquefaction of Chinese lignite, Fungus AH changed its growth rate and pH levels of culture media, compared with its normal growth. UV-VIS analysis showed that main components of bio-liquefied <b>lignite</b> (<b>black</b> liquid) were phenol derivatives, ketones and aldehydes. For IR analysis, bio-liquefaction products and pretreated lignite had similar IR spectra. For GC-MS analysis, 16 high-concentration compounds in black liquid were identified, of which, 11 belonged to aromatic acids or ethers. The average aromatic ring number of these 16 compounds was 0. 875 less than 1. 56 of pretreated lignite...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{petrographic}} analysis results of Ptolemais and Servia Neogene lignites, Northern Greece, are presented. The geological position, lithotype, and maceral content of these lignites, {{as well as}} some chemical parameters and changes in the reflection of different macerals, are described. The interdependence between maceral content and environmental conditions in the process of peat formation is traced. Petrographic analysis shows that coals are represented by different kinds of lignites from dark brown to <b>black,</b> sem ibright <b>lignites,</b> consisting mainly of the coal lithotype humoclarain, rare strips and bands of bright humovitrain, and dull humodurain. The sample from the Lava deposit in the Serv ia Basin is composed of grayish to black, dark humoclarain. The predom inance of humodetrinite macerals () densinite and attrinite and the low contents of inertinite show that the lignites in the Ptolemais and Serv ia Basins are formed in limno-telmatic conditions and in different m ire types, being sim ilar to herbaceous swamp, fen, or marsh...|$|R
40|$|As is known,the {{presence}} of chemical additives is very effective for producing high coal loading CWM(Coal Water Mixture). To reduce process cost, natural additive of CWM such as Humic-Acid extracted from low rank coal and lignin obtained by concentrating the pulp waste liquor(black liquor) are noted well now. At the same time,the extraction {{process and the}} concentration process deplete a lot of chemical reagent and energy. Further more,the problem of pulp waste liquor disposal or utilization has been attacked from many standpoints, People are still seeking an-economical solution. It was once studied to produce CWM using pulp waste liquor directly, but the dispersing effect only by the lignin contained in the black liquor. Corrosion of black liquor due to its high pH is also a difficult problem for the storage transportation and combustion of CWM. This study attempted to extract low rank coal such as <b>lignite</b> using <b>black</b> liquor,and then,prepare CWM using the extraction liquor directly. It {{was found that the}} viscosity of CWM prepared by <b>lignite</b> <b>black</b> liquor extraction was lower than that of CWM prepared using black liquor directly. High coal loading CWM(69 wt%) can be prepared by the new method and the pH of CWM was under 9,which is lower than black liquor whose pH is 13. 特集 : 「資源、新エネルギー、環境、防災研究国際セミナー...|$|R
