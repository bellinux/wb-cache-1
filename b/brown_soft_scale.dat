50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> is polyphagous, {{meaning it}} feeds on {{many species of}} plants. It attacks {{a wide variety of}} crops, {{ornamental}} and greenhouse plants. In Hawaii, host plants include citrus, loquat, papaya, rubber trees and orchids.|$|E
50|$|Coccus hesperidum is a {{soft scale}} insect {{in the family}} Coccidae with a wide host range. It is {{commonly}} known as <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale.</b> It has a cosmopolitan distribution and feeds on many different host plants. It is an agricultural pest, particularly of citrus and commercial greenhouse crops.|$|E
50|$|The adult female {{scale insect}} is oval and dome-shaped, about 3 to 5 mm long. It retains its legs and {{antennae}} throughout its life. Its cuticle {{is made of}} chitin {{but it does not}} produce the copious quantities of wax that armoured scales do. It is a pale yellowish-brown or greenish-brown colour with brown irregular speckles, and darkens with age. Male <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> insects are rarely found.|$|E
50|$|In South Africa, {{the most}} {{troublesome}} diseases are powdery mildew and <b>soft</b> <b>brown</b> <b>scale.</b> The plants {{are prone to}} root rots and viruses if on poorly drained soil or if carried over to a second year. Therefore, farmers favor biennial plantings. Bacterial leaf spot (Xanthomonas spp.) occurs in Queensland. A strain of tobacco mosaic virus may affect plants in India. In New Zealand, plants can be infected by Candidatus liberibacter subsp. solanacearum.|$|R
40|$|The {{commercial}} {{planting of}} boronia (Boroniu inegastigma Nees), which {{is native to}} Western Australia, was established as an essential oil crop in Tasmania in 1985. In general, intensive cultural or monocultural practices are vulnerable to pest problems {{due to lack of}} species diversity. While psyllid pests have now been controlled, scale insects have become a serious pest in some boronia growers fields. Two <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> insects (Hemiptera: Coccidae) attack boronia and have been identified as the black scale, Saissetiu oleae Oliver, and <b>soft</b> <b>brown</b> <b>scale</b> Coccus hesperidum L. At this time, black scale is considered the most serious pest in commercial plantations despite the occurrence of many natural enemies. Similarly, black scale on citrus in California USA, has remained a problem despite a complex of parasitoids and the repeated importation of new natural enemies (Daane and Caltagirone, 1990; Lampson and Morse, 1992). Saissetia oleue is an occasional pest insect and its distribution is mainly in temperate and sub-tropical regions. Daane and Caltagirone (1990) noted that it is common for orchards to have repeated outbreaks while neighbouring orchards do not. Black scale occurs throughout Australia with South Australia, New South Wales, and Victoria more affected due to their large citrus growing areas (Wilson, 1960). <b>Soft</b> <b>brown</b> <b>scale</b> is of European origin (McLeod and Coppel, 1966). It is now common in all tropical and subtropical regions of the world and in greenhouses in cooler regions (Ebeling, 1959; McLeod et al, 1966). Again, South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales are more affected because of their large citrus growing areas (Wilson, 1960). Both scale species, S. oleue and C. hesperidum, are known to have a wide range of host plants. When heavily infested parts of the plant, such as foliage, shoots and fruit, are covered with sooty mould that develops on honeydew excreted by scale insects. Damage to the plant can be either direct, i. e. by sucking sap from the plant or indirect, i. e. by covering parts of the plant with sooty mould that interferes with the efficiency of photosynthesis. Heavy infestation can result in defoliation, fruit drop, twig dieback and in extreme cases, death of the plants (Ebeling, 1959). The application of insecticides to control scale insects without accurate knowledge of pest population control mechanisms could disrupt any potential regulation by natural enemies (Denach and Rosen, 1991; Paraskakis et al 1980). Hely et al. (1982) and Beattie (1991) suggested that application of insecticides against scale insects must be applied at an appropriate time and place in order to get effective results. Boronia growers in Tasmania have relied on materials such as petroleum spray oils and a mixture of these petroleum spray oils with maldison to control black <b>scale</b> and <b>soft</b> <b>brown</b> <b>scale</b> without any sound knowledge of their biology and ecology. This has led to unsuccessful results even though multiple applications have been employed annually. The aim {{of this study was to}} gain an understanding of the population dynamics and the life-cycle of both scale species, to understand their biology and to assess a range of insecticides for possible incorporation into an integrated program to control these species...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} obtain all the {{nutrients}} they need, the scale insects ingest large quantities of sap. They then secrete the excess sugary fluid as honeydew. This is attractive to ants which often tend the scale insects, driving away predators. The <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> does not normally kill the host plant, but the loss of sap probably causes it to grow more slowly and crop less heavily. The main disadvantage to the host is the sooty mould which grows on the honeydew. This reduces the area of leaf available for photosynthesis, and spoils {{the appearance of the}} plant, its flowers and fruits.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> is {{ovoviviparous}} {{and produces}} young by parthenogenesis. Over {{the course of}} her life, the female may produce up to 250 eggs, a few being laid each day. The eggs are retained inside the insect until they hatch, at which time small nymphs emerge and are brooded for a few hours before dispersing. These first-stage nymphs are known as crawlers and move a short distance from the mother before settling and starting to feed. They have piercing and sucking mouthparts and feed on the host plant's sap. They are largely sedentary {{for the rest of their}} lives and pass through two more nymphal stages before becoming adults. A generation takes about two months, and there may be three to seven generations in a year, depending on temperature. Males are occasionally produced and these pass through four nymphal stages before becoming winged adults.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> {{has been}} {{controlled}} {{by the use of}} pesticides, but these have the disadvantage that other insects, friends and foes alike, are also killed. Another approach in citrus is to eliminate ants from the trees, either by preventing the ants from climbing the trunks or by destroying their nests. This allows natural predators to flourish and keep the scale insects under control, although this may lead to an increase in the production of sooty mould. Fungicides can be used to prevent the sooty mould from taking hold. Alternatively, the use of such entomopathogenic fungi, such as Verticillium lecanii, has been successfully used under glass. An alternative approach is integrated pest management in which the natural enemies of the scale insects are encouraged. A further possibility is the use of growth regulators such as the hormone hydroprene which disrupts the moulting of juvenile scale insects.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{summarize}} the economic importance, biology, {{and management of}} <b>soft</b> <b>scales,</b> focusing on pests of agricultural, horti-cultural, and silvicultural crops in outdoor production systems and urban landscapes. We also provide summaries on voltinism, crawler emergence timing, and predictive models for crawler emergence to assist in developing <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> management programs. Phloem-feeding <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> pests cause direct (e. g., injuries to plant tissues and removal of nutrients) and indirect damage (e. g., reduction in photosynthesis and aesthetic value by honeydew and sooty mold). Variations in life cycle, reproduction, fecundity, and behavior exist among congenerics due to host, environmental, climatic, and geographical variations. Sampling of <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> pests involves sighting the insects or their damage, and assessing their abundance. Crawlers of most univoltine species emerge {{in the spring and}} the summer. Degree-day models and plant phenological indicators help determine the initiation of sampling and treatment against crawlers (the life stage most vulnerable to contact insecticides). The efficacy of cultural management tactics, such as fertilization, pruning, and irrigation, in reducing <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> abundance is poorly documented. A large number of parasitoids and predators attack <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> populations in the field; therefore, natural enemy conservation by using selective insecticides is important. Systemic insecticides provide greater flexi-bility in application method and timing, and have longer residual longevity than contact insecticides. Application timing of contact in-secticides that coincides with crawler emergence is most effective in reducing <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> abundance...|$|R

40|$|Metaphycus sp. nr. flavus (Encyrtidae: Hymenoptera) is a {{parasitoid}} species {{collected from}} the Mediterranean region which lays its eggs in the immature stages of several economically important soft scale insects (Hemiptera: Coccidae), including <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale,</b> Coccus hesperidum L. (= host insect). Preliminary tests suggested that the parasitoid is most successful in producing offspring when it oviposits in the younger stages of <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale.</b> In Y-olfactometer bioassays measuring wasp choices and residence times, naïve parasitoids were significantly more attracted to yucca leaves infested with 26, 27, or 28 d-old scale than to uninfested leaves, whereas leaves with older (29 - 30 d-old) scale were no more attractive than uninfested leaves. Parasitoids also spent significantly {{more time in the}} arm with yucca leaves infested with 26 d-old scale than in the arm with uninfested leaves. These results are consistent with observations of the parasitoid's reproductive success on scale of different ages, whereby older scale are more likely to encapsulate the developing eggs of M. sp. nr. flavus females than are younger scale. Further bioassays determined that yucca leaves that had been infested with 26 d-old scale but from which the scale had been removed were as attractive as infested leaves. In contrast, infested yucca leaves from which scale had been removed and the leaves subsequently washed with distilled water were less attractive than infested leaves. Furthermore, the wash water containing scale residues was attractive to female wasps. In total, these results suggest that Metaphycus sp. nr. flavus females utilize volatile, water soluble compounds produced by <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> as cues to locate suitable hosts...|$|E

Soft scale insects appear to account for one quarter to one third of all significant pest problems associated with interior plantscape environments. <b>Brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale,</b> Coccus hesperidum L., is arguably the most common soft scale pest in these locations. The objective of this research project was to assess the potential for reducing C. hesperidum to non-pest status in interior plantscapes using the techniques of classical biological control. Improved methods for rearing C. hesperidum in the laboratory were developed using All Season" squash and Basalla alba, the Malabar spinach. More than a dozen species of encyrfid and aphelinid parasite species were reared from samples taken from naturally occurring California and Texas populations of C. hesperidum. Emerging parasites were screened for successful reproduction on Texas populations of C. hesperidum, and cultures of the most promising species were initiated. Metaphycus alberti (Howard) was chosen for further experimentation because it was found in low density populations in California, its eggs were not encapsulated by the Texas populations of C. hesperidum, it developed reliably, it was gregarious, it had a simple lifecycle, it had a short developmental time, and it was not present in Texas.

40|$|Several ant {{species may}} be {{associated}} with the same honeydew producing insect in citrus orchards. Recently antagonism and competition between two such ants were reported from Letaba. This report stimulated the present study, the purpose of which is to ascertain which ant species are most numerous in citrus orchards ln the Eastern Cape Province; the reasons for these ants being able to occupy orchards; and, finally, their relationships. A survey of the Sundays River Valley and the Fish River Valley revealed that three species - Anoplolepis custodiens Smith, Anoplolepis steingroeveri Forel, and Pheidole megacephala Fabricius - were commonly found in citrus orchards in association with <b>Soft</b> <b>Brown</b> <b>Scale</b> insects. The territorial relationships of these ants were determined by plotting their distribution at intervals for over a year. It was found that this distribution could be correlated with seasonal climatic conditions, the effects of farming practices, brood rearing requirements and behavioural differences between the three species. The ant, A. steingroeveri, had not been previously studied, and since foraging {{is an integral part of}} territorial behaviour, some aspects of its biology, and more especially its foraging activity, were investigated to compare it with the known biology of the other two species. Observations on the foraging activity of A. steingroeveri were made at monthly lntervals for almost a year, and correlated with climatic conditions prevailing at the time. Some seasonal and dally variations in foraging behaviour could not be readily explained in terms of the effects of temperature and humidity on the ants. Other factors, includ 1 ng trophallactic stimulation and overcast skies, were found to influence ant activity. Owing to the apparent lack of information in the literature and possibility of periodic honeydew production by <b>Soft</b> <b>Brown</b> <b>Scale</b> insects controlling ant activity was investigated in the laboratory. The results of this study showed that it was not likely that honeydew excretion restricted the activity of the ants. Several investigators have also found that many interrelated climatic factors correlated with ant foraging behaviour, but have expressed dissatisfaction at not being able to reach the crux of the matter. To clarify the issue a constant temperature chamber was constructed in which a colony of Crematogaster ants was housed and the ants were subjected to a series of temperatures at different humidities, all other factors were eliminated or kept constant. The effects of these two factors on the thermokinetics and foraging activity of the ants were registered. This thesis contains several sections and at the end of each the results are discussed in the light of the available literature and comparisons are drawn between the species under investigation. The main results are given in the summary. After the summary two appendices are included.

To identify further <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> vectors of GLRaV- 3, the ability of three species, Coccus longulus, Parasaissetia nigra and a Saissetia sp., to transmit the virus to grapevine was determined under laboratory conditions. Using cultured <b>soft</b> <b>scales,</b> first-instar nymphs of C. longulus and P. nigra were given acquisition access to GLRaV- 3 -infected rootstock hybrid LN 33. Saissetia sp. was reared on LN 33 infected with GLRaV- 3 and Grapevine virus A (GVA). Nymphs were transferred from virus source to virus-free grapevine plants (cv. Cabernet franc). Recipient plants were tested for GLRaV- 3 and GVA with nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (nested RT-PCR) and RT-PCR, respectively. The study shows {{for the first time that}} C. longulus, P. nigra and a Saissetia sp. are vectors of GLRaV- 3. Saissetia sp. did not transmit GVA. The biology of C. longulus and P. nigra on grapevine was examined at different constant temperatures ranging between 18 and 35 °C, and at 25 and 30 °C, respectively. None of the nymphs survived past the second-instar stage except for one C. longulus female at 30 °C, which produced 117 offspring.
