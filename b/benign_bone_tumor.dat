These foci consist of collagen rich connective tissue, fibroblasts, histiocytes and osteoclasts. They originate from the growth plate, and are located in adjacent parts of the metaphysis and diaphysis of long bones, most often of the legs.

40|$|Background: Synthetic bio-inert {{materials}} are currently {{used as an}} alternative to autogenous bone graft. Calcium hydroxyapatite (HA) and Beta tri-calcium phosphate (&# 946;-TCP), which belong to the calcium phosphate ceramics group, are biocompatible and osteo-conductive. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyse the use of HA and &# 946;-TCP in their ceramic forms as a bone graft substitute in filling bone voids after curettage of <b>benign</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tumors.</b> Materials and Methods: Twenty-four patients in the age range of 3. 5 - 55 years (mean 14. 3 years) having <b>benign</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tumors</b> with <b>bone</b> defects were filled with bone graft substitute following curettage. In 20 patients bone defects were filled with block/granules of HA ceramic and in four with &# 946;-TCP. Fibular strut graft was packed with HA in four patients. The patients were followed up for an average of 18 months (range 12 - 36 months). Results: The functional status of the patients at follow-up was evaluated and compared with preoperative functional status. Early incorporation of graft substitutes became evident radiologically between 6 and 10 weeks (Stage I). Complete incorporation (Stage III) was observed in an average of nine months (6 - 18 months). Clinical healing was observed before radiological healing. The average time taken to return to preoperative function was 14 weeks. There was no recurrence of lesion or growth retardation.

Patients and methodsThis study included 100 patients (66 males and 34 females). Their ages ranged between 4 and 65 years and the mean age was 31. 3 years. The patients were referred to MRI unit from orthopedic surgery and radiotherapy departments and oncology center in Mansoura University hospital. These patients were selected on clinical bases indicating or suggesting presence of bony tumors or tumor-like lesions as a primary diagnosis (e. g. swelling or signs of inflammation). The commonest clinical presentations were pain (n= 71) and swelling (n= 61). Other presentations included limitation of movement (n= 20), back pain (n= 21) and fever (n= 20). More than one symptom may be present in one patient. Patients included in our study were classified according to the pathological and radiological criteria into three groups: <b>Benign</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tumors</b> (14 patients); malignant <b>bone</b> <b>tumors</b> (51 patients); tumor-like lesions (35 patients). ResultsDWI with measurement of ADC values helped in the differentiation of <b>benign</b> and malignant <b>bone</b> <b>tumors,</b> as malignant <b>bone</b> <b>tumors</b> have mean ADC values less than (1. 31 × 10 − 3) mm 2 /s; while <b>benign</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tumors</b> have mean ADC values 1. 43 × 10 − 3 mm 2 /s.
