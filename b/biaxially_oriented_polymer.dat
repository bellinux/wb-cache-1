The samples were tested by {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM), profile method and surface energy measurements to obtain information {{about the influence of}} the treatments on the surface topography and surface energy of the samples and by differential scanning calorimetry and by tensile testing concerning material properties. As key figures arithmetic surface roughness (by AFM at Pulsed Force Mode and profile method), surface energy by surface energy measurement and adhesion between tip and surface by AFM were extracted. Results indicate an influence of both high-pressure processing and thermal-processing on the surface roughness of biaxial oriented polymer films as single layer films.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Compared with metals, polymer materials have Iow strength and stiffness. However, molecular orientation can enhance many mechanical properties of polymer materials {{in the direction of}} orientation. Studies on solid state polymer extrusion (Le. extrusion carried out at temperatures below the melting point of the polymer) through convergent dies show {{that it is possible to}} produce extrudates exhibiting a high degree of monoaxial orientation in the extrusion direction. Although the strength of these extrudates has been greatly enhanced in the orientation direction, the strength decreases in the transverse direction to the axial orientation. <b>Biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> <b>polymer</b> materials, on the other hand, show increased mechanical properties in more than one direction. But so far, extrusion processes that confer orientation in more than one direction have not received much attention. The present work is concerned with the development of biaxial orientation in thick thermoplastics extrudates by extrusion through dies exhibiting simultaneously converging and diverging walls perpendicular to each other and with a cross-section area at the die entry being the same as at the exit. Four die designs are examined, known respectively as the dual-taper die, the expansion fish-tail die, the constant fish-tail die and the cross die, using polytetrafluoroethylene and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. Measurements of birefringence and tensile strength on sections of the extrudates have shown that a preferential orientation along the transverse direction is normally achieved with the fish-tail dies and the dual-taper die, while the extrudates obtained with the cross die were found to exhibit a cross-ply orientation pattern with a bias in the extrusion direction for outerlayers and a preferential orientation in the transverse direction for the middle layers. The mechanics of the processes has been analysed by a plasticity approach for solid state extrusion, and by using variable wall boundaries for the melt extrusion analysis. The extrusion pressure predicted by the analysis compares very well with the values measured experimentally...|$|E
40|$|Tubes {{made from}} <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> liquid-crystal <b>polymers</b> (LCPs) have been {{developed}} for use as penetrations on cryogenic tanks. (Penetrations in this context denotes feed lines, vent lines, and sensor tubes, all of which contribute to the undesired conduction of heat into the tanks.) In comparison with corresponding prior cryogenic-tank penetrations made from stainless steels and nickel alloys, the LCP penetrations offer advantages of less weight and less thermal conduction. An additional major advantage of LCP components is that one can tailor their coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs). The estimated cost of continuous production of LCP tubes of typical sizes is about $ 1. 27 /ft ($ 4. 17 /m) [based on 1998 prices]. LCP tubes that are compatible with liquid oxygen and that feature tailored biaxial molecular orientation and quasi-isotropic properties (including quasi-isotropic CTE) have been fabricated by a combination of proprietary and patented techniques that involve the use of counterrotating dies (CRDs). Tailoring of the angle of molecular orientation is what makes it possible to tailor the CTE over a wide range to match the CTEs of adjacent penetrations of other tank components; this, in turn, makes it possible to minimize differential-thermal expansion stresses that arise during thermal cycling. The fabrication of <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> LCP tubes by use of CRDs is not new in itself. The novelty of the present development lies in tailoring the orientations and thus the CTEs and other mechanical properties of the LCPs for the intended cryogenic applications and in modifications of the CRDs for this purpose.

40|$|Abstract−In {{order to}} {{understand}} the bowing phenomenon in the tentering process of <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> polypropy-lene film, a simple mathematical model has been developed by considering the overall continuity equation and relevant momentum equations. The model has been solved analytically by employing a lubrication approximation for an iso-thermal, Newtonian fluid with variant densities depending upon the external deformation. Both velocity and stress pro-files in the tenter process and also birefringence and extinction angle profiles can be calculated accordingly. Geometrical bowing is strongly dependent upon the degree of volume change during extensional deformation. Theoretical pre-diction is compared with experimental birefringence data with two types of PP resins and two different operation conditions to give us excellent agreement. It can be said that this model is applicable to other <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> film processes such as PET...|$|R
5000|$|Once {{the drawing}} is completed, {{the film is}} [...] "heat set" [...] or {{crystallized}} under tension in the oven at temperatures typically above 200 C.

40|$|A {{reduction}} in thickness of barrier laminated film systems generally {{leads to a}} quality decrease of the resulting packaging materials' functional properties. Especially for food packaging applications, adequate oxygen and water barrier properties are indispensable.

40|$|<b>Biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> films {{produced}} from semi-crystalline, semi-aromatic polyesters are utilised extensively as components within various applications, including the specialist packaging, flexible electronic and photovoltaic markets. However, the thermal performance of such polyesters, specifically poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(ethylene- 2, 6 -naphthalate) (PEN), is inadequate for several applications that require greater dimensional stability at higher operating temperatures. The work {{described in this}} project is therefore primarily focussed upon the copolymerisation of rigid comonomers with PET and PEN, {{in order to produce}} novel polyester-based materials that exhibit superior thermomechanical performance, with retention of crystallinity, to achieve biaxial orientation. Rigid biphenyldiimide comonomers were readily incorporated into PEN and poly(butylene- 2, 6 -naphthalate) (PBN) via a melt-polycondensation route. For each copoly(ester-imide) series, retention of semi-crystalline behaviour is observed throughout entire copolymer composition ratios. This phenomenon may be rationalised by cocrystallisation between isomorphic biphenyldiimide and naphthalenedicarboxylate residues, which enables statistically random copolymers to melt-crystallise despite high proportions of imide sub-units being present. In terms of thermal performance, the glass transition temperature, Tg, linearly increases with imide comonomer content for both series. This facilitated the production of several high performance PEN-based <b>biaxially</b> <b>oriented</b> films, which displayed analogous drawing, barrier and optical properties to PEN. Selected PBN copoly(ester-imide) s also possess the ability to either melt-crystallise, or form a mesophase from the isotropic state depending on the applied cooling rate. An equivalent synthetic approach based upon isomorphic comonomer crystallisation was subsequently applied to PET by copolymerisation with rigid diimide and Kevlar®-type amide comonomers, to afford several novel high performance PET-based copoly(ester-imide) s and copoly(ester-amide) s that all exhibited increased Tgs. Retention of crystallinity was achieved in these copolymers by either melt-crystallisation or thermal annealing.

To meet the demands, research on stretchability has been conducted with the goal of finding the optimum polypropylene molecular structure for developing a new product by analyzing stretching force-strain data using a table tenter, which was thought to be the parameter of stretchability. It was found that low crystallinity and wide molecular weight distribution were effective in improving the stretchability from the table tenter test.
