5|$|Cayce {{flies to}} Moscow to meet Stella {{in person and}} watch Nora work. Nora is <b>brain</b> <b>damaged</b> from an {{assassination}} attempt and can only express herself through film. At her hotel, Cayce is intercepted and drugged by Dorotea and wakes up in a mysterious prison facility. Cayce escapes; exhausted, disoriented and lost, she nearly collapses as Parkaboy, who upon Cayce's request was flown to Moscow, retrieves her and brings her to the prison where the film is processed. There Hubertus, Stella and Nora's uncle Andrei, and the latter's security employees are waiting for her. Over dinner with Cayce, the Russians reveal {{that they have been}} spying on her since she posted to a discussion forum speculating that the clips may be controlled by the Russian Mafia. They had let her track the clips to expose any security breaches in their distribution network. The Russians surrender all the information they had collected on her father's disappearance and the book ends with Cayce coming to terms with his absence while in Paris with Parkaboy, whose real name is Peter Gilbert.|$|E

40|$|This diploma work {{deals with}} the {{situation}} of married couples, people who suffered a <b>brain</b> <b>damage.</b> After a <b>brain</b> <b>damage</b> many various mental changes of grave importance may appear apart from the physical consequences. These consequences affect not only the person that suffered the <b>brain</b> <b>damage</b> but also his closest mainly his partner and affect also {{the quality of their}} marriage. The theoretical part of the diploma work deals primarily with the importance of the marriage from the sociological and the psychological point of view as well. Further the work focuses on the <b>brain</b> <b>damage</b> itself and its consequences. The attention is further drawn to the impact of such situation on the husband or wife of a person after <b>brain</b> <b>damage.</b> Following part {{deals with the}} motivations for marriage. The empirical part of the work focuses on qualitative research based on eight individual in-depth interviews with husbands/wives of a person after a <b>brain</b> <b>damage.</b> The main goal of the work is to map the motivation of a husband/wife of the individual after a <b>brain</b> <b>damage</b> for remaining in marriage and identify other factors connected with this motivation...|$|R

40|$|A {{critical}} role of oxidative stress has {{been implicated in}} ischemic <b>brain</b> <b>damage.</b> Mild ischemic pretreatment and/or synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs) has been suggested to protect against oxidative <b>brain</b> <b>damage.</b> However, experimental support of this suggestion {{have proven to be}} difficult partly because sensitive indices to assess oxidative consequences of ischemic <b>brain</b> <b>damage</b> were few. In this study, we have attempted to establish biochemical assay systems to quantitate oxidative <b>brain</b> <b>damage</b> following ischemia. We produced experimental brain ischemia in the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) and examined the hippocampus for ischemic <b>brain</b> <b>damage.</b> The results obtained from ischemic gerbil hippocampus demonstrated that oxidative <b>brain</b> <b>damage</b> can be quantitated by determining glutathione oxidation ratio together with the accumulation of the oxidative DNA damage product, 8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (8 ohdG). Our results also demonstrated a role for mild ischemic pretreatment and synthesis of HSPs against oxidative <b>brain</b> <b>damage.</b> We showed that mild 2 -min ischemic pretreatment reduced the degree of both glutathione oxidation ratio and 8 ohdG accumulation in gerbil hippocampus subsequent to 10 min ischemic challenge. We also showed that the accumulation of HSP 70 was closely associated with the reduction of oxidative <b>brain</b> <b>damage.</b> To our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate glutathione redox states and oxidative DNA damage levels to evaluate a protective role of mild ischemic pretreatment and HSP synthesis following brain ischemia. Our data validate the previous suggestions and provide new additional data that argue for the protective role of mild ischemic pretreatment and HSP 70 synthesis against oxidative <b>brain</b> <b>damage.</b> ope...|$|R
