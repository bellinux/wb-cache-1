5000|$|In Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Birmingham CC the Court of Appeal was {{required}} to consider whether a defence of [...] "passing on" [...] existed under English law. Such a defence had been suggested by academics, and the counsel for the respondent local authority argued that because the bank had entered into <b>back-to-back</b> <b>swaps,</b> any loss arising under the swaps with the local authority had been passed on under other contractual arrangements. The Court of Appeal rejected that such a defence existed.|$|E
5000|$|Kleinwort Benson v South Tyneside MBC {{was a first}} {{instance}} decision of Mr Justice Hobhouse (who would hear {{a number of the}} swaps cases). The court made a number of important holdings, mostly relating to the effect of limitation periods under English law. The court held that (1) for the purposes of limitation each contract had to be looked at separately, rather than simply looking at the bank's net claim; (2) payments by the local authority under the swaps did not amount to an [...] "acknowledgement of indebtedness" [...] {{for the purposes of the}} Limitation Act 1980; (3) the fact that banks had entered into <b>back-to-back</b> <b>swaps</b> was irrelevant in relation to liability under these swaps (the decision in Kleinwort Benson v South Tyneside MBC was handed down prior to the Court of Appeal decision in Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Birmingham CC); and (4) as the claim was at common law only simple interest could be recovered. An appeal against the decision was stayed pending the outcome of the decision in Westdeutsche.|$|E
50|$|Welwyn Hatfield DC {{had also}} {{entered into a}} <b>back-to-back</b> <b>swap</b> with Islington London Borough Council, and Islington LBC was joined to the {{proceedings}} as an interested third party. Accordingly, in commercial terms Hatfield Welwyn DC was just acting as an intermediary (for which it effectively received the sum of Â£210,000) and the net payments would flow through to either Morgan Grenfell or Islington LBC depending upon the movement of interest rates.|$|R
40|$|We {{show how}} {{to restructure the}} {{counterparty}} risk faced by the originator of a securitization or covered bond arising from an interest rate hedging swap assisted by a "one-way" collateral agreement. This risk emerges when the swap is negotiated between the special purpose vehicle and a third party that covers itself through a <b>back-to-back</b> <b>swap</b> with the originator. We show that the counterparty risk of the originator may be removed by adding a chain of back-to-back credit derivatives between the three parties (originator, counterparty and vehicle).
