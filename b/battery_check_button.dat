40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} design of a miniature acoustic data storage tag intended for the tracking of small fish. The essential components of the system have been integrated in standard 0. 5 um CMOS technology. Geopositioning of the tag is achieved by measuring the transit time of a sonar signal emitted from a fixed source location. The received sonar signal is pre-amplified, filtered by three switched-capacitor filters, digitized, and then correlated with the expected pattern stored in internal memory. The monolithic temperature sensor is embedded in a band-gap reference circuit. The analog output of the temperature sensor is converted to digital by means of a 10 bit switched-capacitor ADC. The external memory stores all physical data such as sound arrival time, water temperature, and pressure. A power-on-reset and a <b>battery</b> <b>check</b> circuit are utilized for power management. ^ Each analog CMOS circuit block has been successfully designed, fabricated, and tested. Testing has proven that every analog unit meets the required specification. ...|$|R
40|$|MANETs are multi-hop ad-hoc {{wireless}} networks where nodes {{can move}} arbitrary in the topology with variation {{of speed and}} trajectory. As MANET network has no infrastructure or dependency, it can be implemented easily in any environment. But the main problem in such networks is to calculate the behavior of different routing protocols in different environments due to limited computing power, low bandwidth, high mobility and absence of central coordinating entity. The need for quality of service in mobile Adhoc infrastructure is increasing day by day due to more attacks, faults and congestion. Two major parts which provide such kind of service in mobile Adhoc devices are fault tolerance and energy saving. This proposed work is suitable for fault tolerance of the node in MANET by applying a novel cluster approach and time constraints. This work also aimed at implementing <b>battery</b> <b>checking</b> scheme to avoid faulty conditions in network and to provide an auxiliary path finding scheme in case of node failure.

50|$|The EF used {{a unique}} shutter among Canon's 35mm SLRs: a Copal Square vertical-travel metal blade focal plane shutter. Unusually, long {{exposures}} (from 1 second to 30 seconds) were electronically controlled, while shorter ones (1/1000 second to 1/2 second) were mechanically controlled. This was very useful in conserving battery power, and allowed one {{to use the}} camera even with dead batteries. The light metering system's power switch turned on the meter, removed the lock from the shutter trigger button and let the film advance lever pop out 15 degrees from the camera body, all in one flick of the thumb.In the axis of the main switch, a multiple exposure button is located. Pressing this while cocking the shutter prevents advancing the film. The frame counter is also blocked, thus preserving the correct frame count.At the time, most cameras did not support longer exposure times than about one second, without having to use the bulb setting. Maybe this was why Canon placed a red LED {{to the left of}} the pentaprism, and had the LED flashing as long as the electronic shutter timer was running. The LED was also used for <b>battery</b> <b>check.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop teaching media for mathematics specifically for materials on trigonometry using GUI Matlab. This media can be used as teaching and learning aid for students at senior high school, grade XI in the fir st semester. This intructional media consists of instructions on how to use the media, learning materials, exe rcises and profile. The trigonometry materials which are discussed in this intructional media consist of the sum and difference of two angles. The limitation on the angles that can be used are special angles in the intervval - 360 o ???,??? 360 o. The special angles are 0 o, ? 30 o, ? 45 o, ? 60 o, ? 90 o, ? 120 o, ? 135 o, ? 150 o, ? 180 o, ? 210 o, ? 225 o, ? 240 o, ? 270 o, ? 300 o, ? 315 o, ? 330 o, and ? 360 o.
