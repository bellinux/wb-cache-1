40|$|Meligethes viridescens (Fabricius), bronzed or rape <b>blossom</b> <b>beetle,</b> is a {{widespread}} and common pest of oilseed rape [Brassica napus L. and Brassica rapa L. (Brassicaceae) ] in the western Palaearctic subregion. The establishment of M. viridescens in eastern North America has raised concern that its presence is a potential risk to the Canadian canola industry, especially to the prairie ecozone of western Canada where up to 4 million ha of summer canola (B. napus and B. rapa) are grown annually. Study of museum specimens indicated that M. viridescens was first recorded in Nova Scotia in 1947. Field surveys indicated that, as of 2001, M. viridescens was established as far west as Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec. A CLIMEXTM model for M. viridescens in Europe was developed and validated with actual distribution records. In Canada the model predicted that once introduced, M. viridescens would readily survive in the canola-growing areas. The actual distribution of M. viridescens in eastern Canada matched the predicted distribution well. The westward dispersal to and establishment of M. viridescens in canola-growing areas of Ontario and western Canada, particularly southern Manitoba, appear to be inevitable. Establishment in these areas presents the risk of substantial production losses to canola producer...|$|E
40|$|In organic {{systems in}} France, the yields of WOSR {{are known to}} be low and {{variable}} {{due to the lack of}} references on suitable crop management. The aim of our study was to assess four different crop management strategies for organic WOSR in geo-graphically broad network of farmer’s fields. Theses strategies were built in order to limit the impacts of the main limiting factors, i. e nitrogen / weeds and insects. Experiments comparing the four strategies were performed on a network of farm fields in four contrasted regions over 2 years. This study investi-gated also the potential use of turnip rape trap crop to control insect pests on organic winter oilseed rape during the third year. The cropping strategies differed in sowing date, crop density and row spacing, in order to use mechanical weeding. Decision rules concerning the utilisation of mechanical harrow were tested. Hypothesis on the effects of each crop management strategy on crop growth, on pests and environmental conditions were formalized and tested. An early sow-ing date decreased the attack of autumn insects and slugs and blackleg incidence. The smothering effect of oilseed rape on weeds depended on the interaction between the sowing date, the amount of available soil nitrogen at crop emergence, the crop density and the soil management. Attack of <b>blossom</b> pollen <b>beetle</b> were more important on turnip rape than on WOSR but in some cases the trap effect was not sufficient enough to limit pollen beetle damage in WOS...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{organically}} cultivated {{oil seed rape}} in Germany is very high. But the risk of cultivation due to the high demand of N-supply, preceding crop, weed manage¬ment and plant protection is very high as well. In a two-year experiment, the effects of (I) preceding crop (ryegrass-clover-mixture: (a) cut mowing vs. (b) mulching, (c) peas and (d) barley-pea-mixture), (II) row distance of oil seed rape (12. 5 cm, 25 cm, 37. 5 and 50 cm) and (III) underseed in autumn together with the oil seed rape (with and without white clover) were tested in a split-plot-design with four replicates at the ex-perimental farm of the Institute of Organic Farming (FAL) in Trenthorst. The results showed a very different yield level with 0. 85 t ha- 1 in 2004, and 1. 68 t ha- 1 in 2005, which {{is a result of}} a high pressure due to <b>blossom</b> rape <b>beetles</b> (Meligethes aeneus) in 2004. The highest yield of oil seed rape was realized after the mulched ryegrass-clover-mixture with 1. 29 t ha- 1 in 2004 and 2. 48 t ha- 1 in 2005, but only in 2005 it was significantly different to the cut mowing system. In both years yield was significantly higher after ryegrass-clover compared to pea or barley-pea-mixture. In comparison of the different row distances, yield was significantly lower at the row distance of 12. 5 cm. The undersown white clover decreased the yield {{with the exception of the}} 12. 5 cm plots. This effect is caused by the weed control done with a mechanical hoe in the plots without the undersown clover combined with the wider row distances. So in these plots the heavy clay soil were aerated, which stimulated the N-mineralisation during the time of high N-demand by the oil seed rape in early springtime...|$|R
40|$|Pollination {{ecology of}} 10 Asclepiads viz. Calotropis procrea (Ait.) Ait. f. ssp. hamiltonii, Glossonema varians (Stocks) Hook. f. oxystelma esoulentum (Linn. f.) R. Brown, Pentatlropis nivalis (Gmel.), Field and Wood, Pergularia daemia (Forssk.) Chiov.,Pergularia tomentosa L. of tribe Asclepiadeae and Caralluma edulis (Edgew.) Benth., Carralluma tuberoulata N. E. Brown, Ceropegia bulbosa Roxb. and Leptadenia pyrotechnica (Forssk.) Decne. Of tribe Ceropegieae {{has been carried}} out from Pakistan. In this {{connection}} floral phenology and morphology, location of germination locus, in-vitro pollinium germination, floral visitors and their pollnium load, level of pollinator activity in natural populations, mechanism of pollinarium removal and pollinium insertion, pollen ovule ratio and ratio of pollen grains per pollinium to ovules per carpel have been studied. Andromonoecy is being reported {{for the first time in}} Glossonema varians (Stocks) Hook f. and in the family. Flower life of the studied taxa is usually short ranges only from 1 - 3 days. A variety of structural adaptations have been revealed in response to the mode of pollination, particularly in pollinium morphology and orientation, stigmatic chamber, coronal elements, nectaries and nectar location and presentation. It has been demonstrated that pollinarium removal and pollinum insertion are specialized processes rather than a chance and exhibit definite relationship with the specialized floral. modifications. Apart from presence of residual corpusculum and narrowness of stigmatic chambers. other three factors like closing of stigmatic chamber. presence of glandular papillae in the stigmatic chamber, and anther wings are reported to be responsible for the proper and successful insertion of the pollinium into the stigmatic chamber. A correlation between pollinarium removal and pollinium insertion exist and thus revealed that pollinium insertion rates are the positive function of removal rates. Pollinators (insects) are species as well as tribe specific. Calotropis procera (Ait.) Ait. f. ssp. hamiltonii (Wight) Ali is regarded as Xylocopa blossom (Meljttophilous), Glosscsonema varians (Stocks) Hook. f. and Oxystelma esculentum (Linn. f.) R Brown as bee and wasp blossom (Melittophilous),PentatropiS nivalis (Gmel.) Field and wood, Pergularia daemia (Forssk.) Chiov.,and Pergularia tomentosa L. as bee and moth blossom (Melittophilous and Phalaenophilous). Ceropegia bulbosa Roxb. As fly blossom (Myophilous) and Leptadenia pyrotechnica (Forssk.) Decne. as fly and <b>beetle</b> <b>blossom</b> (Myophilous and Cantharophilous). The germination locus of the pollinium seems to be correlated with the flower structure and pollination mechanism of the species. Pollinium of each species required a specific sugar concentration for optimal germination (in vitro pollinium germination) which is more or less similar to its floral nectar sugar concentration. A relationship has also been observed between pollinium vigor (in - vitro), pollinarium removal and pollinium insertion with respect to flower age. However. pollinium vigor and pistil receptivity did not change significantly with the flower age. Low pollen ovule ratios seems to be the characteristic feature of Asclepiads. Pollen ovule ratios have been correlated with a number of floral characters, pollinator type and pollinator activity. Number of floral and particularly reproductive characters such as pollinium orientation and morphology, germination locus, pollinator type, pollinator activity and pollen ovule ratios provide additional evidence in support of the tribal classification. It has been concluded that Asclepiads possess a high degree of synorganization of variety of structural elaborations and functional process of pollination...|$|R
