500|$|The {{growth of}} the rivalry during the 1990s {{attracted}} the attention of broadcasters and has led to fixtures being rescheduled from the 3pm <b>blackout</b> <b>period</b> to primetime viewing in the United Kingdom. League matches are often broadcast on Sky Sports – once as early as 11:15am, while cup games have aired on mainstream channels, BBC One and ITV. At the height of the rivalry, the games on Sky had been billed as title deciders, and play was summarised by Martin Tyler and Andy Gray. The April 2003 match at Highbury, advertised as [...] "Face Off", was seen by a British audience of 3.4million, while the 2005 Cup final was watched by more than 480million viewers worldwide.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of the general debate {{concerning}} corporate governance. It focuses on a mechanism of self-regulation geared at avoiding market abuses: the use of <b>blackout</b> <b>periods</b> during which insiders are temporarily prohibited from trading on the market. Data concerning corporate characteristics, <b>blackout</b> <b>periods,</b> and internal dealing, seem to indicate that companies with a large number of independent directors and a consistent ability to monitor are more likely to adopt <b>blackout</b> <b>periods.</b> However, the research shows that during 2003 insiders did not comply with Italy's Code of Best Practice; they did not totally refrain from trading during the assigned <b>blackout</b> <b>periods.</b> All three variables measuring frequency trading â the numbers of transactions carried out, of active insiders, and of shares traded â were statistically significant during the specified <b>blackout</b> <b>periods.</b> Therefore, this paper could have practical implications for policy makers. If they decide to adopt self-regulation to fight market abuses, they must be aware that a law is only as effective as its enforcement.

30|$|Since no {{link layer}} packet retransmissions are deployed, {{the system is}} not able to recover from the packet drops {{observed}} due to the following reason. Due to postural mobility, there are transient <b>blackout</b> <b>periods</b> during which a neighbor may appear to be connected in a node's neighbor table, when in fact it is no longer connected. These <b>blackout</b> <b>periods</b> are created during a node's neighbor time-out period, which was chosen to be two polling frames or 2.8 [*]sec, as reported in Section 3.2. Packet transmissions during such <b>blackout</b> <b>periods</b> end up in packet drops since no link layer reliability is used. All five evaluated protocols suffer from such packet losses, which are captured in the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) as reported below.|$|R

40|$|Signal {{degradation}} {{suffered by}} the vehicle is a combination brownout and blackout during Mars atmospheric entry. The communications brownout means that signal fades and blackout means that the signal is lost completely. The communications brownout and <b>blackout</b> <b>periods</b> are analyzed and predicted with an altitude and velocity profiles. In the brownout period, the range measurements between the vehicle and the orbiters are modeled as intermittent measurements with the radio signal arrival probabilities, which are distributed as a Rayleigh distribution of the electron number density around the entry vehicle. A new integrated navigation strategy during the Mars atmospheric entry phase is proposed to consider the probabilities of the radio measurements in the communications brownout and <b>blackout</b> <b>periods</b> under the IMU/beacon scenario {{based on the information}} filter with intermittent measurements.

5000|$|Finally, the Court {{believed}} that the Bar's means of advancing its interest was acceptable. [...] "The Bar's rule is reasonably well tailored to its stated objective of eliminating targeted mailings whose type and timing {{are a source of}} distress to Floridians, distress that has caused many of them to lose respect for the legal profession." [...] Although Went For It had suggested that the Bar could have banned only solicitations to seriously injured citizens, the Court noted that the commercial speech test did not mandate that a state use the least restrictive means to implement its objective. Furthermore, the <b>blackout</b> <b>period</b> was brief, and there remained other ways for injured Floridians to learn about available legal services during that time. Lawyers may still advertise on television, on billboards, and in the yellow pages during the <b>blackout</b> <b>period.</b> [...] "These ample alternative channels for receipt of information about the availability of legal representation during the 30-day period following accidents may explain why, despite the ample evidence, testimony, and commentary submitted by those favoring (as well as opposing) unrestricted direct-mail solicitation, respondents have not pointed to - and we have not independently found - a single example of an individual case in which immediate solicitation helped to avoid, or failure to solicit within 30 days brought about," [...] a lack of access to legal services on the part of lesser educated or less sophisticated citizens. For all these reasons, the Court ruled that the First Amendment allowed Florida to impose this <b>blackout</b> <b>period</b> on direct-mail solicitation of accident victims by lawyers.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT – Cavitation {{is one of}} {{the serious}} {{problems}} in hydraulic turbines negatively affects their efficiency and may cause damages. Cavitation is a phenomenon which occurs as a pitting of metallic surfaces of turbine parts because of the formation of cavities. In this paper, cavitation in Kaplan turbine unit 2 in Rosieres power plant was studied and analyzed during flood, water restriction and <b>blackout</b> <b>periods.</b> The general features of cavitation were described and cavitation variables were determined in the plant. Cavitation indexes and critical cavitation factors were calculated and compared during these three periods. The results showed that: the turbines were operated within cavitation limit during these periods.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} and trading performance of outside directors’ equity deferrals, which represent {{the choice to}} convert part or all of their annual cash compensation into deferred company stock. Using a large sample of S 2 ̆ 6 P 1500 firms that allowed directors to defer their cash fees into equity between 1999 and 2009, we find significant associations between equity deferral choices and specific features of the director compensation plans, proxies for directors’ outside wealth diversification, and future firm stock market performance. Trading performance analyses indicate that outside directors earn substantial abnormal returns from their deferrals, with {{a significant proportion of}} the deferral transactions occurring during <b>blackout</b> <b>periods.</b> These results are consistent with companies structuring director equity deferral plans to circumvent U.
