5|$|The {{bodywork}} for {{the concept}} car displayed in 1988 was hand built from aluminium by Park Sheet Metal, a specialist automotive engineering company that manufactures concept cars and low-volume, niche models for various manufacturers, including Bentley. QCR Coatings undertook final {{painting of the}} <b>bodyshell</b> in silver. The concept also featured electrically operated scissor doors and a transparent engine cover {{to show off the}} V12 engine.|$|E
25|$|The {{units were}} also {{the last of a}} long line of BR {{multiple}} units {{to be based on the}} Mark 3 <b>bodyshell</b> design.|$|E
25|$|The <b>bodyshell</b> of {{the second}} {{generation}} Rex was also lengthened and widened to become the original Subaru Justy, with a larger 1-litre engine. The Justy remained in production until 1994, outliving the next generation Rex and even the Rex label itself.|$|E
5000|$|Gliders, kit cars, microcars, karts, <b>bodyshells,</b> kayaks, flat roofs, lorries ...|$|R
5000|$|Sport 1.3 S (Tipo 818.650/651): 1970-72. Same engine as Series 1 1.3 S, but {{five-speed}} transmission. Very early {{versions of}} these Series 2 cars were fitted with Series I <b>bodyshells</b> {{with a separate}} spare wheel-hatch and smaller rear lights and aluminium bonnet and doors. Later versions have all-steel <b>bodyshells,</b> no spare wheel hatch, and larger rear lights.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike NASCAR, which {{mandates}} {{the use of}} steel-bodied shells, CASCAR-approved cars {{consisted of}} fiberglass <b>bodyshells</b> covering custom-made tube-frame racing chassis.|$|R
25|$|Most {{models were}} of GL {{specification}} and all had metric instrumentation. A lower trim Chevanne commercial fleet model was also offered, however, unlike the European models, it used the estate <b>bodyshell</b> - complete with side windows - and was badged as a Vauxhall.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} base E model {{was introduced to}} the range in 1980, aimed at fleets and budget-minded buyers, using the four-door <b>bodyshell.</b> This car was incredibly spartan – fitted with plain wheels and vinyl seats – and lacked reversing lamps, hazard flashers, radio and many gauges.|$|E
25|$|Only minor styling changes {{highlighted}} the 1976 Buick LeSabre, {{which was the}} final year for the 1971-vintage <b>bodyshell,</b> the unpopular and rarely-ordered driver- and passenger-side airbag option, the 455 V8 and hardtop bodystyles. Changes amounted to rectangular quad headlights, eggcrate grille and turn signals located just below the headlights.|$|E
5000|$|... 3D printed <b>bodyshells</b> are {{available}} through Shapeways. The 2mm and 3mm versions are by Valve Design, the 4mm one by Rail 3D Prints.|$|R
50|$|The Panther Lima <b>bodyshells</b> were {{manufactured}} in Fibreglass, by Industrial Marine Fibreglass (IMF), who {{were based on}} the Milber Industrial Estate, Newton Abbot, Devon.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bodyshells</b> of the {{locomotive}} were constructed at Bombardier's Wrocław site, bogies at Siegen, alternators from its Hennigsdorf factory; {{the locomotive}}s were assembled at Kassel.|$|R
25|$|Grand Prix sales {{increased}} to {{an all-time high}} of over 270,000units for 1977, {{the last year for}} this bodystyle, despite competition from a newly downsized and lower-priced Ford Thunderbird introduced this year and a restyled Mercury Cougar XR-7 whose <b>bodyshell</b> switched to the T-Bird this year from the discontinued Ford Torino/Mercury Montego.|$|E
25|$|By 1975, Peugeot {{had taken}} over Citroën (forming the PSA Group), and the 104 coupé <b>bodyshell</b> then {{formed the basis of}} the 602cc {{two-cylinder}} engined Citroën LN. In 1982 this car was fitted with the more modern 652cc engine of the Visa in 1983 to become the LNA, before production finally ceased in 1985.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Mark 1, few {{multiple}} unit classes {{were based on}} the Mark 2 <b>bodyshell.</b> Most were electric {{multiple unit}}s with British Railways, and which operated under AC using overhead wires. The first of these were Class AM10 in 1966 operating commuter services from London Euston and in the West Midlands. The introduction of TOPS saw these units reclassified Class 310. The other type was Class 312, a derivative of, and almost identical to, the Class 310, introduced in 1975, primarily used on commuter services from London King's Cross and London Liverpool Street, the last slam-door multiple units built for British Railways. Northern Ireland Railways used the Mark 2 <b>bodyshell</b> {{as the basis for the}} 80 Class DEMU, which entered service in 1974. Thirteen 5 car electric multiple units were built in 1976 for Taiwan (and withdrawn in 2009): the Taiwan Railway EMU100 series.|$|E
50|$|Oaris <b>bodyshells</b> will be {{manufactured}} from aluminium. The driving end cars will be 26,780 mm long, middle cars 24,780 mm long, an 8-car set will be 202.24 m long.|$|R
5000|$|... 1995 and 1996 stock {{have similar}} <b>bodyshells,</b> but they use {{different}} AC traction control systems, more modern on 1995 stock since the 1996 stock design spec was 'frozen' in 1991.|$|R
50|$|Originally trading as Microplas, {{the company}} has its origins in the 1950s {{producing}} <b>bodyshells</b> for {{a small number of}} fibreglass sports cars. However, by 1958 the company had started producing Microplas boats.|$|R
25|$|After the {{alliance}} of Monteverdi and Frua split off in Summer 1969, that <b>bodyshell</b> {{remained in the}} Frua works in Turin. A year or so later Frua changed some details on front and rear, including some semi-hidden headlamps which had been seen on the Iso Lele and the Iso Grifo, second series, before. The car was called AC 429; it remained a one-off.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the standard Class 150 units, a single two car DMU was constructed using the same <b>bodyshell</b> {{for use as a}} track assessment unit on stretches of line where heavier stock cannot be safely used. This unit was initially classified as Class 180, but was reclassified in the departmental series as Class 950 upon the entry into service of the Class 180 Adelante units.|$|E
25|$|The Chevette's 1.3 litre {{engine and}} {{relatively}} small <b>bodyshell</b> allowed for good performance. The Chevette had a light steering, clutch and gearchange, {{as well as}} good visibility and was spacious inside. The Chevette's success was probably due to its versatility, which compared well with larger cars like the Ford Escort. It was available in three-door hatchback for the single driver, and saloon models which suited families, estate car for the service fleets and the 'Chevanne', van version for all other utility purposes.|$|E
5000|$|Sport 1.3 (Tipo 818.332/333): 1966-69. In 1966 Sport was {{upgraded}} to an 818.302 1,298 cc engine from the Rallye 1.3, producing [...] at 6,000 rpm. Early versions still had all aluminium <b>bodyshells</b> (700 were produced with both 1,216 cc & 1,298 cc engines), but later ones were fitted with steel <b>bodyshells</b> with aluminium bonnet, doors, and spare wheel hatch. Whereas the first Sport was homologated as a two-seater, {{the car was}} now classified as a three-seater—or 2+1. The 1.3 can be distinguished from the 1.2 for its silver- instead of ivory-painted steel wheels, and the side mirror on the driver's side front wing.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bodyshells</b> of the DEB {{sets were}} {{very similar to the}} two-car 600/700 class railcars that had entered service in 1949. However as they were {{intended}} for long distance services they were air-conditioned.|$|R
50|$|The {{cars were}} based on {{standard}} <b>bodyshells,</b> but were allowed significant modifications to turn the car into a racecar and differentiate it from the Super Production class that would run alongside BTC Touring in the 2001 BTCC.|$|R
25|$|The 1968 {{models were}} fully {{redesigned}} with an extensive restyle on a longer 111-inch wheelbase that gave Chevy's compacts a chassis {{that was just}} one inch shorter {{than that of the}} midsize Chevelle coupe. The station wagon and hardtop sport coupe were discontinued, the former in line with an industry trend which left AMC the only American maker of compact station wagons until Chrysler rejoined the market in 1976 (the 1966–70 Ford Falcon wagon was actually a midsize, using a <b>bodyshell</b> identical to the Fairlane wagon's).|$|E
25|$|They {{were the}} first member of the Electrostar family, which also {{includes}} Classes 375, 376, 377, 378, 379 and 387, and are the most numerous type of EMU built in the post-privatisation period of Britain's railways. They have the same basic design, <b>bodyshell</b> and core structure as the Turbostar diesel multiple unit (DMU), which is in turn the most common post-privatisation diesel multiple unit family, and both evolved from the Class 168 Clubman design by Adtranz. The 357s are operated by c2c on the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway.|$|E
25|$|The WM Statesman {{features}} the same <b>bodyshell</b> as the WM Caprice, but the Caprice possesses a sportier character {{than the more}} conservative Statesman. Less chrome is incorporated outside compared to the Statesman. Visually the boot may look smaller from the outside but it is considerably larger inside compared to the VE. The front windscreen and the front doors are the only parts of the Caprice that are visually {{the same as the}} VE. Unlike previous models, the rear doors were not taken from the Commodore wagon; the WM's elongated rear doors enable easier entry and egress.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} [...] "Type 1" [...] {{cars for}} Portland, Oregon's MAX Light Rail system, ordered in 1981, were built by BN {{in association with}} Bombardier Inc.. They were assembled in North America using <b>bodyshells</b> sourced in La Pocatiere, Canada.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bodyshells</b> {{are also}} to be {{supplied}} from Bombardier's Wroclaw plant (Poland). In 2015 Bombardier contracted Panattoni Europe to construct an additional 18357 m2 manufacturing hall for the Wroclaw plant, initially {{to be used for}} the construction of the ICx trains.|$|R
50|$|BMH {{started using}} legacy jigs and tools to produce {{complete}} <b>bodyshells</b> for historic models in 1988. It began production with its MG MGB replacement body, after {{the car had}} been out of production for 8 years. In 1991 it restarted production of MG Midget bodies.|$|R
25|$|On 2 May 2016 an open day {{was held}} at Bristol St Philip's Marsh depot with a line up of Class 43s from each {{operator}} (except Cross Country) to celebrate the HST's fortieth anniversary. Several locomotives and passenger trains also appeared, such as 150247 and 166214 both in their new GWR liveries, 158798 in its Springfield livery and the prototype Class 41 HST. At the event, powercar 43002 was unveiled in original Intercity 125 livery. and named Sir Kenneth Grange after the Class 43's <b>bodyshell</b> designer. On 2 October 2016, powercar 43185 had been unveiled in InterCity Swallow livery. Both are operated by Great Western Railway.|$|E
25|$|The {{downside}} {{of the new}} units was the more restricted view through the windows. The Mark 3 <b>bodyshell</b> has a much higher window sill level than the first generation DMUs and moreover the alignment of the windows with the seating positions is poor, a problem common to much Mk 3 derived stock. The view is especially poor for passengers seated nearest to the doors, whose view is obscured by the pockets into which the doors slide when opened, or {{at the ends of}} the vehicle. Also unlike the first generation DMUs, the rear of the driver's cab was not glazed, so passengers in the front seats no longer had a view of the track ahead, which was regretted both by railfans and children.|$|E
25|$|Based on the Mark 1 <b>bodyshell</b> design, the Class 303 units {{utilised}} electrical gear made by Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick). The Class 303s {{were originally}} dual voltage - {{parts of the}} North Clyde Line and Cathcart Circle electrification was limited to 6.25 kV (rather than the standard 25 kV arrangement) due to limitations in insulation technology, although this feature was rendered redundant as 25 kV was eventually standardised across the entire line. Following a series of transformer explosions, caused by damage to the transformer windings from backfires in the mercury arc rectifiers, the entire stock of Class 303s had to be hastily withdrawn from service {{after only a few}} weeks' service. The old steam-operated service was temporarily reinstated whilst urgent modifications were made. This also delayed the handing over of the Cathcart Circle service to electric operation.|$|E
50|$|The SX {{carriage}} {{stainless steel}} <b>bodyshells</b> were constructed by Commonwealth Engineering, Granville with the fitout undertaken at Rocklea in 1961/62. They were built to operate suburban services on the Brisbane rail network. They shared many components with the New South Wales U set carriages.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to freight rolling stock, the plant produced <b>bodyshells</b> for the British Rail Class 60 during the Procor period, and British Rail Class 92 during Bombardier's ownership. During the Second World War the factory {{was involved in}} the production of the Churchill Tank.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bodyshells</b> of the 195s will be {{constructed}} in Zaragoza and the wheelsets will {{be constructed}} in Beasain. Final {{assembly of the}} units {{will take place in}} Irun, with the first completed Class 195 scheduled for testing at Velim in March 2018. Construction started in July 2017.|$|R
