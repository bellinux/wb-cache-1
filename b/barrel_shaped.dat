5|$|The Walronds was {{probably}} built in 1605 {{which is the}} date over the hall fireplace. John Peter, a lawyer, acquired the property by marriage into the Paris family and his initials are over the fireplace. The plan is a traditional one with the ground floor hall divided from the entrance passage by a screen. The main range has three storeys {{and there are two}} wings which are both two storeys high. In the upper south-east room is a <b>barrel</b> <b>shaped</b> ceiling and a second fireplace with the date 1605. The association with the prominent local gentry family of Walrond of Bradfield House only dates from the eighteenth century.|$|E

25|$|The oldest {{roof trusses}} are four arch-braced roof trusses forming the four bays in {{the centre of}} the Church. At the west end, above the gallery, further trusses were altered in the 17th or 18th centuries and are divided by a collar-beam truss. At the chancel end the roof is {{panelled}} over with a <b>barrel</b> <b>shaped</b> ceiling to provide a 'canopy of honour' of 15th century design, although most of the fabric of this is now of later date.|$|E

25|$|Willis {{considered}} that The Tweeds bow shape {{was responsible for}} its notable performance, and this form {{seems to have been}} adopted for Cutty Sark. Linton, however, felt that the stern was too <b>barrel</b> <b>shaped</b> and so gave Cutty Sark a squarer stern with less tumblehome. The broader stern increased the buoyancy of the ship's stern, making it lift more in heavy seas so it was less likely that waves would break over the stern, and over the helmsman at the wheel. The square bilge was carried forward through the centre of the ship. In the matter of masts Cutty Sark also followed the design of The Tweed, with similar good rake and with the foremast on both ships being placed further aft than was usual.|$|E
500|$|The English Water Spaniel was {{described}} as having a long and narrow head, with small eyes and ears that were long and covered in thick curls of fur. The body was moderately stout and <b>barrel</b> <b>shaped,</b> {{but not as much}} as that of the Field Spaniel. Its legs were long and straight with large feet.

500|$|The cap is {{hemispherical}} to convex, reaching [...] in diameter, although {{specimens of}} [...] {{have been found}} in some cases. Slightly velvety and lobed or dented, it is dark brown, greyish-brown, violet brown, or purple brown, often with copper, golden, or olivaceous patches. The stipe is [...] high by [...] wide, usually shorter than the cap diameter, initially <b>barrel</b> <b>shaped</b> but gradually becoming club shaped and tapering at the base. The stipe is pale brown, chestnut, or reddish brown in colour, covered in a brown or concolorous reticulation. Like in other boletes, there are tubes rather than gills {{on the underside of the}} cap. The tube openings—known as pores—are small and rounded. Whitish or greyish-white when young, they slowly become yellowish or greenish yellow at maturity, and can turn wine coloured with bruising. The tubes themselves are initially white, later becoming yellowish or olivaceous. The thick flesh is white, exudes a robust and pleasant smell reminiscent of hazelnuts, and has a mild sweet taste.|$|E
40|$|The {{shape of}} a small liquid drop on a small {{diameter}} fiber may be either an axisymmetric <b>barrel</b> <b>shape</b> {{or it may be}} a non-axisymmetric clam-shell shape. Experiments show that when the reduced volume, given by the volume of droplet divided by the fiber radius, is large the <b>barrel</b> <b>shape</b> is the preferred conformation, but that as the volume reduces a transition to a clam-shell (pearl) shape occurs. The volume at which this stability transition occurs depends upon the equilibrium contact angle. In this work we review the known solution to Laplace's equation for the <b>barrel</b> <b>shape</b> and consider the link between the profile, the inflexion in the profile and the stability of the droplet. No known solution of Laplace's equation exists for the clam-shell shape droplet. We therefore consider a finite element approach to determining the possible shapes of a droplet on a fiber and give numerical results for the clam-shell profile. The surface free energies for the two types of droplet conformation on a fiber are computed for several droplet volumes and equilibrium contact angles and the implications of this for droplet stability are discussed...|$|R

500|$|Opisthocoelicaudia [...] is a genus of sauropod dinosaur of the Late Cretaceous Period {{discovered}} in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. The only species is Opisthocoelicaudia skarzynskii. A well-preserved skeleton lacking only {{the head and neck}} was unearthed in 1965 by Polish and Mongolian scientists, making Opisthocoelicaudia one of the best known sauropods from the Late Cretaceous. Tooth marks on this skeleton indicate that large carnivorous dinosaurs had fed on the [...] and possibly had carried away the now-missing parts. To date, only two additional, much less complete specimens are known, including a part of a shoulder and a fragmentary tail. A relatively small sauropod, Opisthocoelicaudia measured about [...] in length. Like other sauropods, it would have been characterised by a small head sitting on a very long neck and a <b>barrel</b> <b>shaped</b> trunk carried by four column-like legs. The name Opisthocoelicaudia means [...] "posterior cavity tail", alluding to the unusual, opisthocoel condition of the anterior tail vertebrae that were [...] on their posterior sides. This and other skeletal features lead researchers to propose that Opisthocoelicaudia was able to rear on its hindlegs.|$|E

This was the troublesome engine that was {{installed on the}} 1977 to 1980 Cessna 172N Skyhawk. [...] It was notable from all other Lycoming models by incorporating hydraulic lifters that were <b>barrel</b> <b>shaped</b> instead of mushroom type, {{in an attempt to}} make the lifters possible to be serviced without having to disassemble the entire engine case, but the higher load on the cam lobes resulted in severe spalling. Multiple service bulletins and airworthiness directives have been issued regarding this specific model, and multiple modifications exist to attempt to mitigate its design defects.|$|E
2500|$|The Australian {{painted lady}} is {{remarkably similar to}} the painted lady (Vanessa cardui). It is {{differentiated}} by its smaller size, rarely exceeding 2 inches (5 cm) across its wings, and the blue colouration at {{the centre of the}} four eyespots on its hindwings. Its body is dark brown, almost black, all over, except the tips of the antenna which are white. The base of the wings are brown, which turns into a brick red colouration, broken by bands of black. The tips of the forewing are black with four white dots running from the apex of the wing, and a white bar extending from {{the leading edge of the}} forewing. The hindwings have four round eyespots at their base, with a blue centre for at least three. The underwings are almost identical to the upperwings, except the base of the underwings is brick red rather than brown. The Australian painted lady's colouration allows it to blend in effectively with the ground. Males and females look almost identical. The ovum is translucent green in colour and <b>barrel</b> <b>shaped</b> with 13 to 15 vertical ribs. Right before hatching, the black head and grey-tinted body appear through the shell.|$|E

40|$|Extensive {{experimental}} {{investigations have}} shown {{some of the}} differences between the behaviours of the barrel and the clamshell shapes of droplets on ?lter ?bres in ?ow ?elds. Realistic ?ow velocities (such as those used in many industrial ?lter systems) were utilised. The forces acting are air drag, interfacial tension and gravity. The properties of the interfacial restoring force are modelled, and show agreement with the experimental results, at least in the linear extension region before the onset of oscillatory behaviour of the droplets(induced by instability of the ?ow?eld). The model for the oscillatory behaviour is explored, and the natural frequencies of oscillation in the radial and transverse directions are shown to be the same, for the <b>barrel</b> <b>shape.</b> The clamshell shape also has the same natural frequencies, but they are different to those of the <b>barrel</b> <b>shape.</b> The coupling of the radial and transverse oscillation models is explored for both the <b>barrel</b> and clamshell <b>shape.</b> Some contact angle results are given, both without air?ow acting on the droplet and with increasing air?ow.

He did {{an immense}} amount of {{research}} {{as to why the}} Dhol was <b>shaped</b> in the <b>Barrel</b> <b>shape.</b> He discovered that the only reason was {{because of the fact that}} there was Goat Skin on both sides of the Drum. The Treble skin had to be pulled very tight with the rope and the tension had to remain in the stretching process. The shape of the wooden barrel kept the tension in the rope therefor the skin would remain tight.As Johnny had mounted [...] "Dholak" [...] hooks he realized that the <b>barrel</b> <b>shape</b> was no longer needed as the hooks took up the tension.Johnny then went to Pakistan to get a straight barrel Dhol Drum made from a village outside Lahore, Punjab.From learning that tree's had to be planted in order to make 3 Drums 4 Dholaks & 6 Tablas from 1 Talli Tree (equivalent to an Oak or Mahogany) this was not going to be the easiest of tasks, however it was achieved with some backhanders at the airport and the DHol Barrel was carried back to UK.|$|R
