The role of acetylation in synaptic plasticity and memory is now well established. However, {{the role of}} this important protein modification in synaptic plasticity induced <b>by</b> <b>massed</b> pattern of stimulation or memory induced <b>by</b> <b>massed</b> {{training is}} not well understood. Here we show that increasing the level of acetylation enhances long-term potentiation induced <b>by</b> <b>massed</b> pattern of high frequency stimulation.
