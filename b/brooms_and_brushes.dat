'I wish thou couldst remember, man, that I {{desire to}} know nothing of your roars and splores, your <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes.</b> I dwell here among my own people; and I sell my {{commodity}} to him who comes {{in the way of}} business; and so wash my hands of all consequences, as becomes a quiet subject and an honest man. I never take payment, save in ready money.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} the captives were {{deprived}} of their clothes, and in their place were given dirty linen jackets and loose trousers. Their shoes were also taken away. They then fell in {{with the rest of}} the captives. On leaving the prison they were formed into companies, each of which, under a strong guard, marched off in different directions. The three friends kept close together, and were assigned to a company which was told off to clean the streets of a certain quarter of the town. They were furnished with <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes,</b> and were soon hard at work. As the morning went on, the heat became tremendous. Several men fell, but the overseers lashed them until they got upon their feet again.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} had not been seen by Linda's eyes for nearly a month, when Peter Steinmarc and Madam Staubach settled between them that the ice should be broken. On the {{following}} morning aunt Charlotte prepared herself for the communication to be made, and, {{when she came in}} from her market purchases, went at once to her task. Linda was found by her aunt in their lodger's sitting-room, busy with <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes,</b> while Tetchen on her knees was dry-rubbing the polished board round the broad margin of the room. [...] "Linda," [...] said Madame Staubach, [...] "I have that which I wish to say to you; would you come with me for a while?" [...] Then Linda followed her aunt to Madame Staubach's own chamber, and as she went there came over her a guilty fear. Could it be that her aunt had heard of the words which the {{young man had}} spoken to her? ...|$|E

60|$|I {{will not}} pretend that this thought finally drove {{me from the}} scene, for I am of a very hardy make {{when it comes to}} the most frightful sort of suppositions. But the {{afternoon}} was wearing away, and we must go sometime. It seemed better also to leave the gayety at its height: the river covered with soft colors, and the barges and house-boats by the brink, with their companies responsive in harmonies of muslin and gauze and lace to those afloat; the crowds on the opposite shore in constant movement, and in vivid agitation when the bell and the pistol announced a racing event. We parted with our friends on the barge, and found our way through the gypsy crones squatted on the grass, weaving the web of fate and selling <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes</b> in the intervals of their mystical employ, or cosily gossiping together; and then we took for the station the harmless fly which we had forever renounced as predatory in the morning.|$|E
60|$|He shed an {{official}} glance upon the situation, {{and then began}} to give orders. Two women-servants came out with pails and <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes,</b> and gave the sidewalk a thorough scrubbing; meanwhile two others scrubbed the four marble steps which led up to the door; beyond these we could see some men-servants taking up the carpet of the grand staircase. This carpet was carried away and the last grain of dust beaten and banged and swept out of it; then brought back and put down again. The brass stair-rods received an exhaustive polishing and were returned to their places. Now a troop of servants brought pots and tubs of blooming plants and formed them into a beautiful jungle about the door and the base of the staircase. Other servants adorned all the balconies of the various stories with flowers and banners; others ascended to the roof and hoisted a great flag on a staff there. Now came some more chamber-maids and retouched the sidewalk, and afterward wiped the marble steps with damp cloths and finished by dusting them off with feather brushes. Now a broad black carpet was brought out and laid down the marble steps and out across the sidewalk to the curbstone. The PORTIER cast his eye along it, and found it was not absolutely straight; he commanded it to be straightened; the servants made the effort--made several efforts, in fact--but the PORTIER was not satisfied. He finally had it taken up, and then he put it down himself and got it right.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from her}} own funds, the money for these various {{projects}} came {{from the sale of}} handicrafts made through projects initiated by the princess mother, such as pressed-flower greeting cards and <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes</b> made from the sisal hemp.|$|E
50|$|Most of the Shaker villages were {{involved}} in making these flat <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> flat <b>brushes.</b> The flat brooms were produced {{by the tens of}} thousands. Only a few of the original Shaker flat brooms made in the nineteenth century have survived into the twenty-first century. These were made under the auspices of a Mount Lebanon Shaker Trustee named Robert Valentine (1822-1910).|$|R
50|$|By 16 May 1943, the SS Ostindustrie GmbH {{controlled}} several {{factories and}} workshops across Poland, grouped into five active Werke. These included a glassworks in Wołomin (Werk I), a turf factory in Dorohucza (Werk II), a <b>broom</b> <b>and</b> <b>brush</b> factory in Lublin (Werk III), workshops in Bliżyn, Radom, and Tomaszów (Werk IV), and Splitwerk - a grouping which comprised a shoe factory, tailoring factory, carpentry and joinery at the Budzyn Arbeitslager, a turf factory in Radom and an iron foundry in Lublin (Werk V). Several additional Werke were under construction at that time, including vehicle spare parts factories, the Trawniki Arbeitslager (Werk VI), earth and stone works in Lublin (Werk VII), a medical sanitary ware factory (Werk VIII), various slave-labor workshops in Lemberg, and the Poniatowa Arbeitslager (later transferred to Többens). By mid-1943, Globocnik projected {{the labor force}} of Osti to include some 45,000 Jews from a network of parallel camps with the main branch at Majdanek; however, the physical infrastructure in the region was insufficient for such numbers.|$|R
500|$|Hurricane Easy was {{described}} as the worst hurricane in the Cedar Key area in 70years. The hurricane left half of the houses destroyed or unfit for rehabilitation, while 90% of the others were damaged. The strong winds destroyed the roofs of 150homes and buildings. The rainfall caused severe flooding that resulted in crop damage. Easy was indirectly responsible for two deaths due to electrocutions. In addition, 27people were injured from the hurricane. The strong waves destroyed the fishing community's entire fishing fleet of 100boats, which was the town's entire livelihood. The town's main employment center, a <b>broom</b> <b>and</b> <b>brush</b> plant, was severely damaged, and would close {{two years after the}} hurricane. The hurricane also produced severe damage in Pinellas and Hillsborough Counties in the Tampa area. Throughout Florida, damages totaled $3.3million (1950USD), a lower than expected total due to the sparse population {{in the area of the}} worst damage. After the storm's passage throughout central and northern Florida, [...] "blisters" [...] developed on hundreds of cars; the locations affected reported that the blisters formed on the surface of vehicles shortly after Easy retreated. The following day, the blisters disappeared. Researchers later created several theories as to the unusual occurrence, though they concluded that air pockets under the layer of paint expanded as a result of the decreased barometric pressure.|$|R
50|$|The village {{arose in}} the late 12th century. In {{historical}} records the village was first mentioned in 1349. In 1823 {{had been in the}} village 23 houses. Locals were engaged in agriulture and a hand made production of <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the {{beginning}} August Strauss {{and his two}} sons, including Engelbert (*1908) traded in <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes</b> that were manufactured in Kassel, a district of Biebergemünd. Due to its focus on manufacturing brooms (German Besen) this district is still commonly called Besenkassel.|$|E
50|$|The 2500 sq ft gallery {{is located}} in a former factory, which was built during the mid 20th century, to dress fibers and {{bristles}} for <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes.</b> The creation of the gallery involved renovation of the interior, leaving the exterior as it was.|$|E

60|$|It did {{not take}} the eager youths long to reach the hallway of the building, and once there, all three hurried to the spot where they thought the opening might be located. Soon they came to the little closet which the janitor had once {{mentioned}} to them-- a small place in which was located a sink, and also a number of <b>brooms,</b> <b>brushes,</b> <b>and</b> cleaning cloths.|$|R
60|$|One {{might leave}} Southwark rather {{glad to be}} out of it, for in spite of its {{patriotic}} and poetic associations it is a quarter where the scrupulous house-keeping of London seems for once to fail. In such streets as we passed through, and I dare say they were not the best, the <b>broom</b> <b>and</b> the <b>brush</b> <b>and</b> the dust-pan strive in vain against the dirt that seems to rise out of the ground and fall from the clouds. But many people live there, and London Bridge, by which we crossed, was full of clerks and shop-girls going home to Southwark; for it was one o'clock on a Saturday, and they were profiting by the early closing which shuts the stores of London so inexorably at that hour on that day. We made our way through them to the parapet for a final look at that stretch of the Thames where Cromwell as unwillingly as unwittingly perhaps stepped ashore to come into a kingdom.|$|R
50|$|The town of Ghassanieh was {{originally}} an industrial town, manufacturing <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes</b> for the Lebanese market.

5000|$|The trunk fibres {{produced}} by the leaf sheaths of Trachycarpus fortunei are harvested in China and elsewhere to make coarse but very strong rope, <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes.</b> This use {{gives rise to the}} old alternative name [...] "hemp-palm". The fibrous leaf sheaths are also frequently used to clothe the stems of artificial palms.|$|E
5000|$|Theodore Bates (1762-1846) of the Watervliet Shaker {{community}} {{is credited with}} the innovation of the [...] "flat broom" [...] in 1798, as all <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes</b> prior were round. He invented a unique wooden vise that pressed the round bristles flat. This allowed heavy twine to be sewed through the flattened broom to permanently hold that shape.|$|E
50|$|The Marcegaglia Group {{also has}} various {{subsidiary}} companies {{in a wide}} range of other industrial and non-industrial sectors, such as engineering, with the design and construction of metallurgical installations and establishments; metal structural work and electronic monitoring systems; the energy industry, with the design and construction of electrical power plants using biomass and photovolaic panels; the environmental sector, supplying services for safety and environmental protection to businesses and individuals; metal products, with the manufacture of <b>brooms,</b> <b>brushes</b> <b>and</b> shovels for household cleaning; agriculture and livestock farming, with the management of agricultural estates and rearing facilities; and tourism and property (Forte Village, Pugnochiuso, Albarella and Stintino).|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had seen}} nothing of Armand. I {{wondered}} where he was, and I {{knew that he}} would be eating out his heart with anxiety for me. But God was watching over me. At first I was transferred to the Temple prison, and there a kind creature--a sort of man-of-all work in the prison took compassion on me. I do not know how he contrived it, but one morning very early he brought me some filthy old rags which he told me to put on quickly, and when I had done that he bade me follow him. Oh! he was a very dirty, wretched man himself, but he must have had a kind heart. He took me by the hand and made me carry his <b>broom</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes.</b> Nobody took much notice of us, the dawn was only just breaking, and the passages were very dark and deserted; only once some soldiers began to chaff him about me: 'C'est ma fille--quoi?' he said roughly. I very nearly laughed then, only I {{had the good sense to}} restrain myself, for I knew that my freedom, and perhaps my life, depended on my not betraying myself. My grimy, tattered guide took me with him right through the interminable corridors of that awful building, whilst I prayed fervently to God for him and for myself. We got out by one of the service stairs and exit, and then he dragged me through some narrow streets until we came to a corner where a covered cart stood waiting. My kind friend told me to get into the cart, and then he bade the driver on the box take me straight to a house in the Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois. Oh! I was infinitely grateful to the poor creature who had helped me to get out of that awful prison, and I would gladly have given him some money, for I am sure he was very poor; but I had none by me. He told me that I should be quite safe in the house in the Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois, and begged me to wait there patiently for a few days until I heard from one who had my welfare at heart, and who would further arrange for my safety." ...|$|R
50|$|Each doll (with the {{exception}} of the Core (Basic Line) dolls) has glass eyes with an articulated, posable body. The dolls come with a <b>broom</b> hair <b>brush,</b> <b>and</b> some come with a spell scroll and a doll stand. Some have a unique pet, sold separately, and most have a personal witch mark symbol. Character cards come with the first edition dolls. They reveal augmented reality content when held up to a webcam: virtual doll animation and character video. The Core (Basic Line) dolls are part of an inexpensive budget line and have a non-articulated body and painted eyes as opposed to the usual glass eyes.|$|R
50|$|Bates' vise idea {{to make flat}} <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes</b> was a leap in {{technology}} since it produced products that worked much more efficiently. An industry developed to sell these to the outside world. Soon the New Lebanon community ramped up to make these flat brooms. This flattening technology worked well with their woodworking technology of lathe-turned wood handles. The vise was used {{as part of the}} Shaker broom making process.|$|E

Handcrafts include {{textiles}} such as blankets, sashes, rugs, cushions, tablecloths, carrying bags and quezquémetls made of wool. In San Felipe del Progreso and Villa Victoria, there are workshops which made <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes.</b> In Temascalcingo, red clay pottery is dominant especially cooking pots, flowerpots and crucibles. The making of gloves, scarves and sweaters is dominant in Ixtlahuaca. Straw hats {{are made in}} Atlacomulco. Silversmithing is done in San Felipe del Progreso.|$|E
60|$|On a chair rested Mr. Rover's suitcase, locked but unstrapped. On {{the bureau}} were his comb <b>and</b> <b>brush,</b> a whisk <b>broom,</b> <b>and</b> some other toilet articles.

50|$|Synthetic {{materials}} such as nylon are also used to make bristles in items such as <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> sweepers. Bristles are often used to make brushes for cleaning purposes, as they are strongly abrasive; common examples include the toothbrush <b>and</b> toilet <b>brush.</b> The bristle <b>brush</b> <b>and</b> the scrub <b>brush</b> are common household cleaning tools, often used to remove dirt or grease from pots and pans. Bristles are also used on brushes other than for cleaning, notably paintbrushes.|$|R
60|$|A {{long time}} ago, [Endnote: 1] {{in a town}} with which I used to be familiarly acquainted, there dwelt an elderly person of grim aspect, known by the name and title of Doctor Grimshawe,[Endnote: 2] whose {{household}} consisted of a remarkably pretty and vivacious boy, and a perfect rosebud of a girl, {{two or three years}} younger than he, and an old maid-of-all-work, of strangely mixed breed, crusty in temper and wonderfully sluttish in attire. [Endnote: 3] It might be partly owing to this handmaiden's characteristic lack of neatness (though primarily, no doubt, to the grim Doctor's antipathy to <b>broom,</b> <b>brush,</b> <b>and</b> dusting- cloths) that the house--at least in such portions of it as any casual visitor caught a glimpse of--was so overlaid with dust, that, in lack of a visiting card, you might write your name with your forefinger upon the tables; and so hung with cobwebs that they assumed the appearance of dusky upholstery.|$|R
5000|$|Nikola Šećeroski (Никола Шећероски; 1934-2008) was a {{candidate}} for the Serbian Presidency, running in December 1990, without party affiliation. He was born in 1934 in Radožda, a village on the shore of Lake Ohrid in the south-west of Yugoslavia, now the Republic of Macedonia. He was a social activist in the 1970s, and protested against some corrupted officials, and became a politician in the 1980s. A 1-hour long TV interview for TV Beograd ahead of the elections, representing himself, made him famous in Yugoslavia, as he eccentrically spoke about various matters, most famously of the accusations against him by the municipality of Čukarica that he made [...] "brooms and brushes", that had haunted him for three years, stating that he had [...] "nothing to do with <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes,</b> I am a plastic worker", and that they needed to be punished. He made several more TV appearances, such as guesting popular Minimaks. After losing his last job, he turned to make plastic animals, which he received permission of to sell by the municipality, however, according to him, as soon as he neared the main station, he was arrested, written an offense ticket, imprisoned with a straitjacket, then released, accused of selling <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes.</b> He stated that this was due to his past outspoken criticism. He finished 26th with 3,168 votes.|$|E
50|$|The museum offers {{insights}} into the occupations of the brushmakers and brush merchants. With the aid of diverse exhibits it portrays the industrial and social development in Ramberg from about 1800 to the time around 1970. Guided tours by experts inform the visitor about the history, manufacture and marketing of <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes.</b> On view are, for example, technical implements used in brush production, a range of still working machines and the live-size figure of a Ramberg brush merchant in his original dress and equipment. In addition there is an overview of family life in Ramberg from 1780 to 1960.|$|E
50|$|The Ox Fibre Brush Company {{was founded}} in Sanford in 1884 by John K. Robinson. Brushes were made from the fibers of the native cabbage (sabal) palms, which are both strong and flexible. The palms were {{harvested}} from a 500-600 acre plot of land owned by the company {{in what is now}} the Orlandia Heights subdivision. A few years later, the plant was moved to Jacksonville, Florida. In May 3, 1901, a fire in the plant destroyed the plant as well as a significant portion of Jacksonville. The plant was rebuilt in Sanford, Florida, and in 1925, it was moved to a 40 acre site at Benson Junction, where <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>brushes</b> were produced until the plant closed in the 1970s.|$|E

Chameleons, oysters, and jellyfish (of the genus Rhopilema) are among the species that can be found in the region and its coastal waters, while Carob trees, gum rockrose, <b>brooms</b> <b>and</b> almond trees mingle within the forests <b>and</b> <b>brush</b> within the interior.|$|R
50|$|Since the 18th century, the {{municipality}} of Ramberg {{has been known}} {{beyond the boundaries of}} the Palatinate region for its brushmakers <b>and</b> <b>brush</b> merchants; for a long time these were almost the only occupations that were undertaken in this remote corner of the Palatinate Forest. Initially brushmaking was a cottage industry with <b>brushes</b> <b>and</b> <b>brooms,</b> scrubbers <b>and</b> similar everyday articles made painstakingly by hand in the home, it later became a factory-based activity. For example, in 1907 there were eight <b>brush</b> <b>and</b> brushwood factories in Ramberg. The raw materials, especially wood <b>and</b> Common <b>Broom,</b> were obtained inter alia from the Holpertal valley, which begins just northeast of Ramberg. The Ramberg brush merchants sold their wares not just across the whole of Germany, but also in other European countries.|$|R
