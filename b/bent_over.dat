5|$|Hip attack, to a <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> opponent.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
5|$|I said, 'Mr. Malcolm, {{could you}} tell me {{something}} about your mother?' And I will never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E
60|$|She <b>bent</b> down <b>over</b> Anne, and gayly {{patted her}} on the shoulder.|$|R
60|$|The Emperor {{sprang from}} {{his horse and}} <b>bent</b> down <b>over</b> the dead man.|$|R
60|$|But {{he still}} <b>bent</b> unknowing <b>over</b> his plate and gobbled his Irish stew.|$|R
5|$|The {{spore print}} is white, and the oval to oblong spores are 7.5–9.5μm long by 5.0–7.0μm wide. Spores are smooth, hyaline (translucent), nonamyloid, {{and have a}} {{prominent}} hilum. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to club shaped, four spored, and measure 39–50 by 8.0–9.6μm. The cystidia present on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are thin walled, hyaline, have a short stalk and a spherical apical portion, and measure 29–41 by 12–21μm; cystidia are absent from the gill face. The cap cuticle ranges in cellular form from a cutis (in which the hyphae are <b>bent</b> <b>over,</b> running parallel to the cap surface) to a trichoderm (with hyphae emerging roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface); the hyphae comprising the cuticle are cylindrical, and measure 2.0–9.0μm wide with a club-shaped tip up to 11μm wide.|$|E
5|$|Kata is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the posture and movement associated with taiko performance. The term is used in martial arts in a similar way: for example, both traditions include the idea that the hara is the center of being. Author Sean Bender argues that kata is the primary feature that distinguishes different taiko groups from one another, and is a key factor in judging the quality of performance. For this reason, many practice rooms intended for taiko contain mirrors to provide visual feedback to players. An important part of kata in taiko is keeping the body stabilized while performing, and can be accomplished by keeping a wide, low stance with the legs, with the left knee <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the toes and keeping the right leg straight. It is important that the hips face the drum and the shoulders are relaxed. Some teachers note a tendency to rely on the upper body while playing, and emphasize the importance of the holistic use of the body during performance.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{continued}} northeast, becoming {{large and}} wedge-shaped. It then passed {{just north of}} Fairview, completely destroying multiple homes and debarking numerous hardwood trees. Pieces of debris were found speared through vehicles in this area. The tornado then briefly passed through a section of Morgan County {{near the town of}} Hulaco, destroying several older block-foundation homes and snapping numerous large trees off at the base. The tornado then crossed into Marshall County and impacted the rural community of Ruth, just north of Arab. A large but poorly-anchored brick home was swept completely away in this area, with the debris scattered 100 yards from the foundation. Several large trees on the property were ripped out of the ground and missing, along with a trailer that was unable to be located {{at the time of the}} survey. Multiple other homes and structures were impacted in the Ruth area, and a gas station was completely destroyed. A shed was destroyed with pieces of large farm machinery stored inside thrown up to 20 yards away, a storage trailer was tossed 100 yards and found impaled by multiple planks of wood, and concrete power poles in the area were <b>bent</b> <b>over.</b> Arab's power grid was completely crippled by the tornado's effects, and many roads in the area were obstructed by downed trees and power lines. The tornado damaged and destroyed several other homes, garages, and sheds north of Union Grove before it crossed the Tennessee River, snapping numerous trees in a forested area before dissipating.|$|E
60|$|As {{he faced}} Her Majesty, the Outlaw of Torn <b>bent</b> low <b>over</b> his pommel.|$|R
60|$|Mr. d'Alcacer, {{without taking}} his eyes off them, <b>bent</b> low <b>over</b> the deck chair.|$|R
60|$|He looked {{round as}} he spoke. Midwinter {{turned his face}} aside on the instant, and <b>bent</b> it <b>over</b> a book.|$|R
25|$|Herborg's foster-daughter, and Guðrún's sister, Gollrönd had Sigurð's corpse {{unveiled}} {{and she put}} Sigurð's head on Guðrún's knees. Gullrönd asked Guðrún to kiss Sigurd as if he {{were still}} alive. Guðrún <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> Sigurð's head with his clotted hair and her tears began to run like raindrops.|$|E
25|$|On June 22, 2007, Zimmerman fielded {{a routine}} ground ball {{that ended up}} in his jersey. As he <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> to underhand the ball at his stomach level, his jersey top opened and hung {{down in front of}} his glove, causing the ball to go into his jersey instead of his {{positioned}} glove.|$|E
25|$|During a ninety-day {{furlough}} to Phoenix, he {{was notified}} {{that he was}} to receive the Medal of Honor and traveled to Washington with an uncle who was given time off from his job to help him make the trip. In time, Silvestre Herrera would be fitted with new prosthetic feet, but on August 23, 1945, at the White House, President Harry Truman <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> his wheelchair to present him with the Medal of Honor.|$|E
60|$|The lean, gray Brackton <b>bent</b> earnestly <b>over</b> his soiled ledger, {{while the}} riders and {{horsemen}} round him grew silent to listen.|$|R
60|$|Dan <b>bent</b> low <b>over</b> the gunwale {{to hide a}} smile, twitched once {{or twice}} on the roding, and, behold, the anchor drew at once.|$|R
60|$|He <b>bent</b> low <b>over</b> the girl's {{hand and}} placed a seat for her. The party was now arranged. Their host beamed upon them all.|$|R
25|$|Later that month, on January 20, in Horn Hill, Limestone County, Texas, Hardin {{claimed he}} {{killed a man}} in a gunfight after an {{argument}} at the circus. Less than a week after this incident, in nearby Kosse, Texas, Hardin was accompanying a saloon girl home when they were accosted by her pimp, who demanded money. Hardin threw money on the ground and shot the would-be thief when he <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> to pick it up.|$|E
25|$|Another {{result of}} this was that the first {{constitution}} of an independent Anglican Church in the country <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> backwards to distance itself from Rome by calling itself the Protestant Episcopal Church, incorporating in its name the term, Protestant, that Anglicans elsewhere had shown some care in using too prominently due to their own reservations {{about the nature of}} the Church of England, and other Anglican bodies, vis-à-vis later radical reformers who were happier to use the term Protestant.|$|E
25|$|Bottle caps, or closures, {{are used}} to seal the {{openings}} of bottles of many types. They can be small circular pieces of metal, usually steel, with plastic backings, and for plastic bottles a plastic cap is used instead. Caps can also be plastic, sometimes with a pour spout. Flip-Top caps like Flapper closures provide controlled dispensing of dry products. The crown cork, the first form of a bottle cap, possessed flanges <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> a sealed bottle to compress the liquid inside. It was invented and patented in 1892 by William Painter of Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
60|$|Looking {{back over}} his shoulder, Pawnee saw them coming. To lessen the chances of being shot, he <b>bent</b> low <b>over</b> his {{faithful}} mare's neck.|$|R
60|$|He <b>bent</b> hastily <b>over</b> {{the little}} wallet, which never left him. Suddenly a little exclamation broke from his lips. The Professor peered over his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Wingrave laughed shortly, and Aynesworth <b>bent</b> closer <b>over</b> his work, with a {{gathering}} frown upon his forehead. A mirthless laugh {{is never a}} pleasant sound.|$|R
25|$|Saddles also {{vary with}} rider preference, from the {{cushioned}} ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow {{more room for}} leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is <b>bent</b> <b>over,</b> weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist {{for male and female}} cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men. Suspension seat posts and seat springs provide comfort by absorbing shock but can add to the overall weight of the bicycle.|$|E
25|$|During the Battle of Stalingrad, some units {{within the}} {{division}} were seen to construct caves which {{would later be}} transformed into a field hospital and an equipment storage room. The division fought in the ruined city until Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus' surrender in January 1943, with the 297th division's and IV Army Corps mutual commander, General Pfeffer, following suit into Soviet captivity on the 16th. With the airfield lost to the Red Army, the division was so badly-beaten it could hardly be considered a proper fighting force. Pfeffer's successor as division commander, Major General Moritz von Drebber, finally surrendered to the Red Army a mere nine days later. A photograph of Drebber and several other Axis commanders was taken; one of the men photographed was Dr. Otto Renoldi, the chief surgeon for the 6th Army. A chaplain for the division was executed by a Soviet officer when he <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> to treat a wounded man.|$|E
25|$|Graeme Le Saux, an England {{international}} left-back, endured homophobic taunts {{despite being}} married with children. The rumours allegedly began {{because of his}} “unladdish hobbies” which included antique collecting, and his university background. He later admitted he had considered quitting the game because of the abuse and the humiliation he felt. One example of the public abuse he suffered came in a Premier League match between Chelsea and Liverpool on 27 February 1999, Le Saux became involved in a running series of taunts with Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler. With Le Saux preparing to take a free kick, Fowler repeatedly <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> and pointed his backside in the Chelsea player's direction. Despite the obvious taunts, Le Saux, who refused to take the free kick, was booked for delay of play. Unseen by the match officials, Le Saux later struck Fowler {{on the edge of}} the Chelsea penalty area. Both were later charged with misconduct by the FA.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hook {{it into a}} joint," [...] {{advised the}} crow, who was now perched upon a branch that stuck far out and <b>bent</b> down <b>over</b> the water.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Nonsense! thy {{heart is}} dead with fear, thou seest double;' and I <b>bent</b> forward <b>over</b> {{the edge of}} the {{surrounding}} fence, and stared at the heap.|$|R
60|$|The {{rest was}} lost in inarticulate mutterings. The old man sank upon his knees, his knife in his hand, and <b>bent</b> himself <b>over</b> the moaning boy.|$|R
25|$|Shipbuilders, {{probably}} Phoenician, a seafaring {{people who}} lived on the southern and eastern coasts of the Mediterranean, were the first to create the two-level galley that would be widely known under its Greek name, diērēs, or bireme. Even though the Phoenicians were among the most important naval civilizations in early Antiquity, little detailed evidence have been found concerning the types of ships they used. The best depictions found so far have been small, highly stylized images on seals which depict crescent-shape vessels equipped with one mast and banks of oars. Colorful frescoes on the Minoan settlement on Santorini (c. 1600 BC) show more detailed pictures of vessels with ceremonial tents on deck in a procession. Some of these are rowed, but others are paddled with men laboriously <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the railings. This has been interpreted as a possible ritual reenactment of more ancient types of vessels, alluding to a time before rowing was invented, but little is otherwise known about the use and design of Minoan ships.|$|E

60|$|He {{dropped down}} on one knee, and <b>bent</b> close <b>over</b> the dead man, feeling his heart and pulse. In that {{position}} his face was hidden from her.|$|R
60|$|Isobel's {{lips were}} quivering, and I dared make {{no effort to}} console her. The Archduchess came {{suddenly}} {{across the room to}} us, and <b>bent</b> affectionately <b>over</b> Isobel.|$|R
60|$|They assented and I {{crossed the}} room to where Milly was sitting. Pretending to examine the fancy-work upon which she was engaged, I <b>bent</b> close <b>over</b> her.|$|R
