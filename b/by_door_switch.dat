2500|$|When any {{of these}} {{assumptions}} is varied, it can change the probability of winning <b>by</b> <b>switching</b> <b>doors</b> as detailed in the section below. It is also typically presumed that the car is initially hidden behind a random door and that, if the player initially picks the car, then the host's choice of which goat-hiding door to open is random. (...) Some authors, independently or inclusively, assume that the player's initial choice is random as well.|$|R
50|$|The stages contain {{platforms}} such as slopes, half-pipes, moving platforms, etc. The game introduces new gimmicks such as teleportation <b>doors,</b> <b>switches</b> which {{control the}} speed of a stage, massive obstacles, and more.|$|R
5000|$|Automotive tests {{itself to}} enhance safety and reliability. For example, most {{vehicles}} with antilock brakes test them once per safety interval. If the antilock brake system has a broken wire or other fault, the brake system reverts to operating {{as a normal}} brake system. Most automotive engine controllers incorporate a [...] "limp mode" [...] for each sensor, so that the engine will continue to operate if the sensor or its wiring fails. Another, more trivial example of a limp mode is that some cars test <b>door</b> <b>switches,</b> and automatically turn lights on using seat-belt occupancy sensors if the <b>door</b> <b>switches</b> fail.|$|R

50|$|The first {{experiments}} with an RFID implant {{were carried out}} in 1998 by the British scientist Kevin Warwick. His implant was used to open <b>doors,</b> <b>switch</b> on lights, and cause verbal output within a building. After nine days the implant was removed and has since been held in the Science Museum (London).|$|R
50|$|An {{air curtain}} may {{pay for itself}} {{in a few years}} by {{reducing}} the load on the building's heating or air conditioning system. Usually, there is a mechanism, such as a <b>door</b> <b>switch,</b> to turn the unit on and off as the door opens and closes, so the air curtain only operates while the door is open.|$|R
5000|$|TiltElectromechanical slot {{machines}} usually include an electromechanical [...] "tilt switch", which makes or breaks a circuit if {{the machine is}} tilted or otherwise tampered with, and so triggers an alarm. While modern machines no longer have tilt switches, any kind of technical fault (<b>door</b> <b>switch</b> in the wrong state, reel motor failure, out of paper, etc.) is still called a [...] "tilt".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Door</b> <b>switches</b> {{are simple}} on/off {{mechanisms}} {{connected to the}} interior light (dome light), and may also be connected to a warning light, speaker or other device, to inform the driver when the door is not closed. The door light is standard equipment on all cars. In American cars from the 1950s-1990s, they had buzzers or [...] "door dingers" [...] that sounded, along with the check light, whenever any door is open.|$|R
30|$|Open/closing service {{consists}} of two services, which are opening and closing. These two services applies to opening/closing of <b>doors</b> and <b>switching</b> on/off switches.|$|R
50|$|The {{first person}} shooter levels are {{extremely}} simple compared to most {{games in the}} genre: there are no <b>doors,</b> <b>switches,</b> or health or ammunition pickups, and the player has only one weapon (a pistol) with unlimited ammunition. In lieu of health pickups, John Spartan slowly recovers health over time. The level designs are on a two dimensional square grid and are maze-like, with {{a great number of}} branching paths. The player's objective is to reach a specific location within the level.|$|R

The driver's <b>door</b> <b>switch</b> panel featured a restyled power door lock button; it was now designed to feel less like the adjacent power window controls, for ease of differentiation by touch.|$|R
30|$|Apart from integer and boolean datatype, {{five new}} data types are {{introduced}} to support the mentioned objects, namely, NOType, MOType, Location, NOStateType, MOStateType, NOID and MOID. NOType defines the type (ex: cabinet, <b>door,</b> <b>switch)</b> of non-movable object with ID defined in data type NOID. Likewise, MOType defines the type (towel, paper, cup) of movable object with ID defined in data type MOID. Location is the datatype of location.MOStateType and NOStateType are the datatype that defines the state of a movable and non-movable object respectively.|$|R
50|$|Both manufacturers' units look {{exceptionally}} {{similar in}} design; the major noticeable differences for passengers are {{the lack of}} aircraft-style overhead air vents on those produced by GEC Alsthom (465/2), and the BREL (465/0) and ABB (465/1) units also feature slightly different dot matrix displays {{on the front and}} rear of the train to show the route number and destination, compared to the GEC Alsthom units. There are other visible but minor differences in <b>door</b> <b>switches</b> and audible chimes, window shapes and exterior panelling amongst the fleet.|$|R

50|$|The Door Control Unit is {{responsible}} for controlling and monitoring various electronic accessories in a vehicle's door. Since most of the vehicles {{have more than one}} door, generally DCUs are present in each door separately. A DCU associated with the driver's door has some additional functionalities. This additional features are the result of complex functions like locking, driver <b>door</b> <b>switch</b> pad, child lock switches, etc., which are associated with the driver's door. In most of the cases driver door module acts as a master and others act as slaves in communication protocols.|$|R

The player, as Conway, can run and climb on walls, use stairwells and elevators, and using the abilities of Conway's [...] "Bullfrog" [...] hypertrousers, can launch the character great heights or distances, potentially tackling guards or breaking through glass walls. Conway can survive long falls, but can be killed by a single gunshot, thus requiring the player {{to stay out of}} the guards' line of sight.|$|R

The tribe, who call themselves 'The Survivors', gathers {{in a circle and}} Hadin thrusts the female mute into the centre. There, the high priest benevolently examines her—then proclaims, 'Mutant!' The pitiful wretch is dragged to a cubicle recessed in the wall and sealed in <b>by</b> a transparent <b>door.</b> A <b>switch</b> is ritualistically thrown and the chamber floods with blinding light; to the Alphans' horror, the mute's body evaporates.|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} games {{each had}} 15 levels, and Return to Dark Castle contains all the levels from these first two games, plus over 50 new levels. The new areas are {{a mixture of}} single-screen levels {{in the style of}} the first two games, and larger horizontally and vertically scrolling levels. The levels contain 25 orbs, 10 of which are required in order to complete the game. Many of the new levels contain secret areas which can be accessed <b>by</b> activating hidden <b>doors</b> and <b>switches.</b>|$|R
50|$|Almost all OEM alarms are {{typically}} armed and disarmed with the vehicle's keyless entry remote. On many vehicles the key cylinders {{in the driver}} or front passenger <b>door</b> activate <b>switches,</b> so that when a key {{is used in the}} door the alarm will arm or disarm.Some vehicles will arm when the power <b>door</b> lock <b>switch</b> is pressed with the driver's door open, and the door is subsequently closed.Some vehicles will disarm if the ignition is turned on; often when the vehicle is equipped with a key-based immobilizer and an alarm, the combination of the valid key code and the ignition disarms the system.|$|R
50|$|On {{coaching}} stock trains fitted with central door locking (slam door), {{there is no}} ‘local door’ except on the train's Guard's van. Local instructions allow the Guard to operate train doors from any location {{it is safe to}} do so, or where regulations require them to do so. Once it is required, the Guard can lock all doors without requiring closing their door, as the locking bolt does not activate until the door is closed. Coaching stock trains with power doors, like the Mark 4 used on the East Coast Main Line, have local <b>door</b> <b>switches</b> at all <b>door</b> control panel locations.|$|R
5000|$|This {{style of}} tamper {{resistance}} is most {{commonly found in}} burglar alarms. Most trip devices (e.g. pressure pads, passive infrared sensors (motion detectors), <b>door</b> <b>switches)</b> use two signal wires that, depending on configuration, are normally open or normally closed. The sensors sometimes need power, so to simplify cable runs, multi-core cable is used. While 4 cores is normally enough for devices that require power (leaving two spare for those that don't), cable with additional cores can be used. These additional cores can be wired into a special so-called [...] "tamper circuit" [...] in the alarm system.|$|R

The {{other end of the}} hose is inserted into a wall-mounted vacuum inlet, after opening the spring-loaded cover door. [...] In some designs, opening the <b>door</b> <b>switches</b> on the vacuum motor; in other designs, insertion of the metallic hose-end fitting bridges two electrical contacts, signaling the motor to turn on. Other alternative designs feature a remote on/off switch located at the tool end of the vacuum hose, which communicates either via a pair of wires embedded in the hose, or via wireless signaling.|$|R

50|$|It is used {{to allow}} train crew to access the train {{without the use of}} the general {{passenger}} doors or for use in the Guards dispatch duties leaving a station. The public are not permitted to use this device and it should be impossible for a member of the public to access it. Brake Van doors and control panel covers for instance require keys to open, {{and in the case of}} door control panels require another key to prime them for use. Local <b>door</b> <b>switches</b> in the open position while disarmed usually activate the train’s emergency breaking systems; this prevents a <b>door</b> from opening <b>by</b> accident when a crew member arms the control while in motion.|$|R
5000|$|An unusual {{interior}} change {{placed the}} power window switches {{flat against the}} door panel, whereas the window switches for the first generation and third generation extended from the door panels and were oriented in a horizontal position and were located underneath the drivers or occupants hands for easy location and use, and integrated into the door pull and armrest. The express up feature for the driver's window was also removed, leaving express down only. The power <b>door</b> lock <b>switch</b> design was upgraded to a more conventional <b>door</b> lock <b>switch,</b> installed next to the power window switches, with a secondary power lock switch installed for the front passenger. This approach was also used on the 1990-1993 Honda Integra ...|$|R
