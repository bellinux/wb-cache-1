5|$|After the Marianas {{began to}} come under attack, the United States {{military}} stepped up its raids on the Japanese-held islands {{which could be used}} to launch raids on the B-29 bases. Particular attention was given to Iwo Jima, as it was correctly assumed that the Japanese aircraft which attacked the Marianas were flying from Japan and staging through the island en route to their targets. Following the first raid against Saipan in November, XXI Bomber Command B-29s were dispatched against Iwo Jima's airfields on November5 and 8. These attacks were primarily training missions and caused little damage. The first raid was unopposed by the Japanese, but the second was met by eight fighters which inflicted light damage on a B-29; this was the first combat damage suffered <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> XXI Bomber Command's aircraft. The Seventh Air Force also increased the number of B-24 Liberator attacks on Iwo Jima, and these attacked the island 30 times during November.|$|E

5|$|Because of its asymmetry, the {{reaction}} between 249Cf and 50Ti was predicted {{to be the}} most favorable practical reaction for synthesizing unbinilium, although it is also somewhat cold, and is further away from the neutron shell closure at N = 184 {{than any of the other}} three reactions attempted. No unbinilium atoms were identified, implying a limiting cross-section of 200fb. Jens Volker Kratz predicted the actual maximum cross-section for producing unbinilium <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> these reactions to be around 0.1fb; in comparison, the world record for the smallest cross section of a successful reaction was 30fb for {{the reaction}} 209Bi(70Zn,n)278Nh, and Kratz predicted a maximum cross-section of 20fb for producing the neighbouring ununennium. If these predictions are accurate, then synthesizing ununennium would be at the limits of current technology, and synthesizing unbinilium would require new methods.|$|E

5|$|Four county matches {{remained}} {{before the}} Tests, giving the players more chances to press their claims for selection. Johnston was recalled for Australia'a first non-victory of the tour, which was against Lancashire. After {{the first day}} was washed out, Johnston made 24 in a 25-run ninth-wicket partnership with wicket-keeper Ron Saggers, which took Australia from 8/170 to 9/195. The tourists were eventually bowled out for 204. During his innings, Johnston swung lustily and hit three sixes. In reply, Lancashire reached 4/144 before Johnston took five {{of the last six}} wickets to help dismiss the home side for 182, securing a slender lead for the tourists. Johnston ended with 5/49 from 29 overs, the most <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the Australians, and was not required to bat in the second innings.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Abbe {{moved to}} Kyoto {{with his mother}} and his sister Toyoka so that he could attend Busen, {{training}} in both the judo and kendo programmes. Abbe learned kendo under the direction of Busen's head sword instructor, Kinnosuke Ogawa, a master who held the rank of 10th dan. He recalled that his instructor, at the age of 75 years, was so skilled that he could not be touched <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the students or younger instructors. Every Saturday afternoon at Busen, following tradition, judo tournaments were held. Abbe fought five opponents in succession with each contest lasting five minutes, and he won all or almost all of these matches. In his first year at Busen, he was promoted to 4th dan in judo. In the autumn of his second year there, he was promoted to 5th dan, by which time he was reported to have been fighting 20 opponents in succession.|$|E

5|$|Kyousuke's {{younger sister}} is Rin Natsume, the main heroine of Little Busters!, and is {{initially}} {{the only female}} member of the Little Busters. She does not communicate well with others due to her poor social skills and {{can be seen as}} inarticulate. Due to this, she is shy, and is usually seen alone. Rin loves cats and at school takes care of several strays. Riki's roommate and fellow member of the Little Busters is Masato Inohara who loves to work out and improve his muscle mass. He has a particular fondness for Riki, which he is more than willing to express out aloud. Masato's rival and fellow member of the Little Busters is Kengo Miyazawa who is skilled in the art of kendo and seemingly has a cynical personality, but his passion for the Little Busters is unmatched <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the other members.|$|E
5|$|Meetings {{could take}} place either inside or outside of the formal {{boundary}} of the city (the pomerium), though the official meeting place, or curia was at {{the centre of the}} Roman forum. The president of the Senate was normally one of the consuls, but it could be called to meet <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the praetors or tribunes, both of whom had the authority to call the Senate, though praetors rarely did so unless the consuls were away and the tribunes almost never did so. Meetings were suffused in religious ritual. Temples were a preferred meeting site and auspices would be taken before the meeting could commence.|$|E
5|$|One {{specimen}} {{discovered at}} the Cifelli #2 quarry, a right dentary catalogued as CEUM 34447, is unusual {{compared to other}} Eolambia specimens, including both adults and juveniles. While the ratio between the mid-point depth and overall length of the dentaries in other individuals generally ranges from 0.19 to 0.24, the same value in CEUM 34447 is 0.31, making it unusually deep. The dentary also does not deepen substantially at the front end, and thus lacks one of the distinguishing traits of Eolambia dentaries. However, the other distinguishing trait, which is {{the expansion of the}} front end of the coronoid process, is present in the specimen. Although it is possible that this individual represents an unusual Eolambia specimen, McDonald and colleagues cautioned that it may represent a distinct hadrosauroid that differs in the morphology of the dentary from Eolambia (albeit one that is not suggested <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the other materials at the quarry). Thus, they regarded it as an indeterminate basal hadrosauroid.|$|E

5|$|Romney raised $56million during 2011, {{more than}} double the amount raised <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> his Republican opponents, and refrained from {{spending}} his own money on the campaign. He initially pursued a low-key, low-profile strategy. Michele Bachmann staged a brief surge in polls, which preceded a poll surge in September 2011 by Rick Perry who had entered the race the month before. Perry and Romney exchanged sharp criticisms of each other during a series of debates among the Republican candidates. The October 2011 decisions of Chris Christie and Sarah Palin not to run effectively settled the field of candidates. Perry faded after poor performances in those debates, while Herman Cain's 'long-shot' bid gained popularity until allegations of sexual misconduct derailed it.|$|E
