40|$|Wood is {{a highly}} {{intractable}} food source, yet many insects successfully colonize and thrive in this challenging niche. Overcoming the lignin barrier of wood is a key challenge in nutrient acquisition, but full depolymerization of intact lignin polymers has only been conclusively demonstrated in fungi and is not known to occur by enzymes produced by insects or bacteria. Previous research validated that lignocellulose and hemicellulose degradation occur within the gut of the wood <b>boring</b> <b>insect,</b> Anoplophora glabripennis (Asian longhorned beetle), and that a fungal species, Fusarium solani (ATCC MYA 4552), is consistently associated with the larval stage. While {{the nature of this}} relationship is unresolved, we sought to assess this fungal isolate’s ability to degrade lignocellulose and cell wall polysaccharides and to extract nutrients from woody tissue. This gut-derived fungal isolate was inoculated onto a wood-based substrate and shotgun proteomics using Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) was employed to identify 400 expressed proteins. Through this approach, we detected proteins responsible for plant cell wall polysaccharide degradation, including proteins belonging to 28 glycosyl hydrolase families and several cutinases, esterases, lipases, pectate lyases, and polysaccharide deacetylases.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 New species {{introductions}} {{have been}} associated with the movement of people for thousands of years. For instance, horses were introduced into North America by Spanish explorers, while pigs were introduced by the Polynesians into many Pacific islands long before the establishment of permanent European settlements. Both of these species introductions resulted in significant changes in both the biological and cultural composition of these places. However, during the past century, the amount of material transported by people has greatly increased due to the globalization of the economy and breakthroughs in material handling technology. These breakthroughs, such as the steel shipping container and the wooden pallet, allow goods to be moved rapidly in a protected environment. This protected environment prevents goods from being damaged while in transit, but it has also improved the ability of pests to survive transit and resulted in invasive species introductions. The volume of goods being transported has steadily increased during the past 50 years and, thus, the number of species introductions has increased as well, resulting in a number of high profile pest introductions. For instance, the introduction of the Asian long horned beetle into Chicago and New York cost millions of dollars to eradicate and resulted in the loss of hardwood trees that previously lined the streets of these cities. In response to the Asian long-horned beetle and the introduction of the pine wood nematode into Europe, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations drafted and approved International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures Number 15. This measure recognizes solid wood packaging materials as an invasive species pathway and recommends sanitization through heat treatment or fumigation with methyl bromide. However, heat treatment or fumigation are imperfect mitigation tools. Thus, researchers continue to search for alternative methods. Wood preservatives have long been formulated to prevent insect and fungal attack of wood products exposed to warm humid climates, but the ability of these chemicals to eliminate existing insect and fungal colonies has not been investigated. In this study, a number wood preservative systems were investigated to determine if these chemical formulations can be used for this application and to determine if wood preservatives, in general, are suited for use in phytosanitary applications. A method for detecting the presence of wood boring insects through acoustic emissions was investigated. It was thought that a system of microphones and accelerometers could be used to detect wood <b>boring</b> <b>insect</b> presence and activity within a particular wood sample. These assumptions were based on earlier work conducted with termites. This system was to be used to determine if a sample contained wood boring insects prior to using it in the main study. However, acoustic emissions were not useful for this application, since feeding of the wood boring insects was sporadic, unlike termites which feed constantly. Determining the feasibility of using wood preservatives in phytosanitary applications was addressed in three trials: the ability of preservatives to penetrate insect galleries, the ability of the insect larvae and pupae to penetrate a treated barrier and the ability of established wood <b>boring</b> <b>insect</b> populations to complete their life cycle under field conditions in wood pressure treated with preservatives Preservatives completely penetrated between 80 - 100...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Two-hundred shoots {{contained}} within randomly selected locations {{from each of}} thirty-six coast live oak, Quercus agrifolia, trees were sampled to determine the abundance and spatial distribution of acorns infested by the filbert weevil, Curculio occidentis in northern California during 1989. The seasonal abundance of infested acorns was highest at 30 percent during mid-September. Overall, 25 percent of all acorns ob-served on sample trees revealed signs of <b>boring</b> <b>insect</b> activity. Slightly higher infestation rate of 38 percent was obtained from laboratory dissections of field collected acorns (n = 501). Of those acorns dissected in the laboratory found to contain insect larvae, 70 percent contained C. occidentis and 30 percent con-tained the filbertworm, Melissopus latiferreanus. Although acorns were numerous on the sunny side of the tree, infested acorns were more abundant on the shady side. The differential distribution of acorns spatially within trees, acorn survivorship, {{and the impact of}} insect and other animal acorn predators on acorn production are discussed. The sweeping branches of a large regal oak is a vision common to all of us. As a single tree or forest stand, our native oaks {{play an important role in}} wildlife and human ecologies. In California there are 18 species of oaks, 10 of which reach tree size (Tucker 1980; Griffin and Muick 1990). The total acreage for California's oak species has been estimated at 15 - 20 million acres (Plumb and McDonald 1981). For thousands of years, native oaks have been a prominent and persistent floral feature in California.

40|$|Denna rapport är en jämförande studie av utvalda konsolidanter som används till att stabilisera nedbrutet insektsangripet trä. Av de trägnagande skadeinsekter vi har i Sverige är det främst den strimmiga trägnagaren som är intressant i möbelsammanhang. I rapporten beskrivs den strimmiga trägnagaren, en liten skadeinsekt som kan åstadkomma stor skada om den får verka ostörd. Insekten finns utspridd i hela Europa och är ett stort problem då den angriper alla typer av träslag. Nedbrutet insektsangripet trä förlorar sin styrka och kan behöva konsolideras genom att injicera konsolidanter in i träet. Studien är tänkt att jämföra styrkan på de vanligast förkommande och använda konsolidanterna. Urval av dessa har dels gjorts genom att intervjua konservatorer i Sverige, Norge och Danmark, dels utifrån tillgänglig litteratur och forskning. I studien injiceras de utvalda konsolidanterna in i provbitar av artificiellt konstruerat insektsangripet trä som sedan utsätts för hållfasthetsprover. Provbitarna är utformade i kuber av björk, 45 x 45 x 45 mm och är borrade med 2 mm stora hål för att efterlikna angripet trä. Två olika typer av hållfasthetsprov har använts för att mäta styrkan hos de olika konsolidanterna, tryckhållfasthet tvärsfiber och skjuvhållfasthet. Resultaten av hållfasthetsproverna visar inga tydliga tecken på att de injicerade konsolidanterna gett någon direkt styrka till provbitarna. I tryckhållfasthets tvärsfiber finns en dock en tendens tillförhöjda värden. För att kunna dra någon slutsats bör ytterligare studier genomföras. This {{report is}} a {{comparative}} study of a chosen set of consolidating agents used to stabilize wood suffering from the infestation of wood boring insects. When considering furniture, the most common wood <b>boring</b> <b>insect</b> in Sweden is the Furniture Beetle. This report discusses the Furniture Beetle, a small insect which if left alone, achieves {{a great amount of}} damage. This particular beetle can be found in all of Europe and is a sizable problem, since it can attack all species of wood. Infested wood is destabilized by the beetles boring a web of internal tunnels throughout, which results in a loss of strength. This wood is then commonly injected with a consolidation agent to compensate for its internal weakness. The study is made to compare the strength of the most commonly used consolidating agents. These lection of agents was determined by interviewing conservators in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, as well as from accessible literature and research. In the study the selected consolidating agents are injected into trial pieces of artificially compromised wood which are in turn exposed to strength testing in a laboratory setting. The trial pieces are squares of birch wood measuring 45 x 45 x 45 mm which have several 2 mm holes drilled into them lengthwise, to simulate the beetle's pathways. Two types of strength testing were carried out to test the consolidation agents and their effect. One testmeasures the strength by compression across the grain, while the other puts pressure on either side, forcing the piece to fail along the grain. The results of the testing do not distinctively show that the consolidating agents impose any significant strength to the trial pieces. There is however a tendency of increased strength shown in the cross grain compression tests. To draw any firm conclusions, additional research is required...|$|E

However, heritage conservation studies have not established the relative vulnerability of {{the different types of}} wood. Most of the wooden structural elements are coated with urushi varnishes, increasingly taken from Japanese sources, and sometimes paint. These layers tend to hide the damage until it becomes severe [26]. In 2008 restoration work at Sambutsu-do in Nikkō led to the discovery of extensive structural damage to wooden pieces. Severe damage to wood is common after termite infestation, but in this case larvae of Priobium cylindricum (a death-watch beetle, in earlier literature called Trypopitys), collected from infested wooden parts were thought to have caused the damage [24]. The beetle is about 5  mm, but its ecology and sensitivity to temperature and relative humidity is not known [29]. The survey at Nikkō considered P. cylindricum to enter the adult phase between May and July, for a period likely to be less than 1  month.

Between 2003 and 2007 134 mature beech stands on a broad range of geological substrates were surveyed, and collar rot and aerial bleeding cankers were found in 116 (86. 6 %) stands. In most stands the majority of beech trees were declining and scattered or clustered mortality occurred. Bark and soil samples were taken from 314 trees in 112 stands, and 11 Phytophthora species were recovered from 253 trees (80. 6 %) in 104 stands (92. 9 %). The most frequent species were P. citricola, P. cambivora and P. cactorum. Primary Phytophthora lesions were soon infected by a series of secondary bark pathogens, including Nectria coccinea, and wood decay fungi. In addition, infected trees were often attacked by several bark and wood <b>boring</b> <b>insects</b> leading to rapid mortality. Bark necroses were examined for their probable age in order to determine whether the onset of the current Phytophthora epidemic was correlated to rainfall rates recorded at 22 Bavarian forest ecosystem monitoring stations. A small-scale survey in nine Bavarian nurseries demonstrated regular infestations of all beech fields with the same range of Phytophthora species. The results indicate that (1) Phytophthora species are regularly associated with beech decline and may also be involved in the complex of ‘Beech Bark Disease’, (2) excessive rainfalls and droughts are triggering the disease, and (3) widespread Phytophthora infestations of nursery stock might endanger current and future silvicultural projects aiming on the replacement of non-natural conifer stands by beech dominated mixed stands...|$|R
40|$|Data from 753 sample trees, {{representative}} of conditions commonly encountered in forests of southeastern Iowa indicate that: 1. Volume loss from {{all types of}} defects averaged 8. 5 {{percent of the total}} volume of trees in the merchantable size class, 5. 2 percent of the total volume of large poles and 6. 2 percent of the total volume of saplings. 2. In white oak, the most important species represented, the percentage of defective volume decreased with increasing diameter. 3. Slightly over 60 percent of the trees were partially defective from one or more causes. 4. In three out of every four defective trees the defects were evident only after felling and splitting. 5. Over 90 percent of all trees had branch stubs larger than 0. 5 inch in diameter, but only 11 percent of these were defective, probably {{due to the fact that}} the majority of the sample trees were of the younger age classes. 6. Eight percent of all trees bore fire scars, and 50 percent of the scarred trees were defective. Most of the scars were found in trees of merchantable size. 7. The oldest fire scar found in one of the larger trees dissected, originated in 1847 - 48. Fires have occurred at irregular intervals from that date until the present time. 8. Butt rot, transmitted from the parent stump, was found to be present in the young sprout growth and less prevalent in the older sprout stands. 9. Stereum gausapatum was isolated more than five times as often as any other fungus. It was responsible for almost all of the basal rots of which the causal agent was identified. 10. Sixty percent of all trees <b>bore</b> <b>insect</b> injuries, although the defects caused by insects averaged less than 2 percent of the total volume for all diameter classes...|$|R
