40|$|A {{consequence}} of the recent house price falls is that some households will {{find themselves in the}} situation where they owe more than their houses are worth. In other words they are in negative equity. Having peaked in early 2007 house prices in Ireland have fallen steadily. By July 2009 house prices were down 24 per cent from their peak in early 2007.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of Familias en Acción, a {{conditional}} cash transfer program in Colombia, on participant credit behavior. The motivation of the research is derived from previous studies which indicate that conditional cash transfer programs have effects on households aside from those directly intentioned by the programs. While the direct impacts of Familias en Acción have been measured by the research team responsible for evaluating the program, potential indirect effects remain uninvestigated. My research specifically focuses on the impacts of the program on credit behavior. I compute estimates on the percent change in loan <b>balance</b> <b>outstanding</b> and credit participation over the four-year evaluation period by comparing households that are benefiting from the program (treatment) {{and those that are}} not (control). Because Familias en Acción was not a randomly assigned program, I use quasi-experimental data collected in three rounds over four years. I control for dissimilarities between the treatment and control group by utilizing a difference-in-differences approach and by controlling across a wide-range of observable household characteristics. I find that the program does affect credit behavior in treated households. In both urban and rural areas, the outstanding loan balance and the number of households involved in the credit market increases after {{the first year of the}} program. After four years of the program, the effect is still significant and positive in rural areas though not in urban areas. This indicates that the program affects credit behavior in all treated households in the short run and rural households in the long run. These findings provide new considerations for policy makers who are implementing these programs in developing countries...|$|E

40|$|MBA - WBSIn South Africa, {{there is}} {{currently}} little research available on mortgage default and the determinants of default. The purpose {{of this research was}} to evaluate and distinguish between mortgage specific factors (including borrower and loan characteristics), driving mortgage default patterns in South Africa. This study intended to provide guidance to the South African banking industry (i. e. banking institutions), the South African Reserve Bank (policy maker and regulator), and the broader South African population in general. In addition, {{the results of the study}} can be utilised by banking institutions as inputs into their origination scorecard, policy rules and risk-based pricing models. Due to the sensitivities around financial institution’s data in South Africa, the sample used for this study was all current (on book) mortgage loans from an anonymous (single) financial institution in South Africa. Also, due to the practical availability of data, the sample period covered all current loans from said financial institution from August 2006 to December 2008, with information covering each loans default or non-default status during that time period. Based on the review of the literature surrounding mortgage defaults, five hypotheses were formulated. Only 1 of the 5 variables was found to be a good differentiator of mortgage default in South Africa. Current Loan-To-Value (LTV) was found to be the most critical and by far the largest contributor to the model’s ability to differentiate defaults. It was found that the higher the Current LTV, the more likely those borrowers would default. This finding is in line with conventional wisdom in the mortgage industry, in that loan-to-value ratios are positively correlated with mortgage default. The Age of the mortgage (i. e. account age in months since loan origination), Instalment to Income (ITI), Borrower age (years), Borrower Income and <b>Balance</b> <b>Outstanding</b> were found to be irrelevant in contributing to the model’s ability to differentiate mortgage defaults. Also, Balance (Loan) Outstanding was found to be the variable having the least impact on the model’s ability to differentiate iii mortgage defaults. In summary, given that Current LTV (loan characteristic), was found to be the only suitable variable in differentiating mortgage defaults, the conclusion is that only “Loan” characteristics (i. e. Loan to value) impact on mortgage defaults in South Africa. Furthermore, it is the “equity” theory that describes mortgage defaults, and not the “ability to pay” theory of defaul...|$|E
40|$|The Great Recession renewed {{focus on}} {{various stages of}} a mortgage's life [...] -how they are originated, why borrowers default on them, and how default is {{ultimately}} resolved. More specifically, the chapters of this dissertation {{shed light on the}} factors determining the success of mortgage renegotiation, and on the rise in the origination of complex mortgage instruments. Features of the securitized mortgage market are either explicitly studied, or provide the foundation for the empirical methodologies I develop. During the housing crisis regulators faced impediments in their unprecedented intervention to promote large-scale mortgage renegotiation. What hampered renegotiation {{in the wake of the}} crisis? To answer this question, in Chapter 1, The Limited Benefits of Mortgage Renegotiation, I study the expected gains from renegotiation for both sides of a mortgage contract: investors and borrowers. To overcome selection bias, I use plausibly exogenous variation in the propensity of intermediaries to renegotiate mortgages. I find that loan modification helped investors recover 3. 5 % more of the principal <b>balance</b> <b>outstanding</b> at the time of delinquency relative to foreclosing upon the borrower. However, there was substantial variation around this mean [...] -a 12. 5 % (3. 6 times the mean) standard deviation [...] -which highlights the high degree of uncertainty about the realization of these gains. Thus, despite expected gains to borrowers [...] -higher credit scores and a $ 115 increase in monthly consumption [...] -regulators' attempts to promote mortgage renegotiation have proven to be ineffective, exacerbating debt overhang and its consequences. The setting of Residential Mortgage Backed Securitization (RMBS) provides an ideal testing ground for theories of debt-structure, agency problems and their effect on debt renegotiation. Via the tranching of cash flows from underlying mortgages, an RMBS transaction creates multiple securities with claims to the underlying collateral. Moreover, tax law mandates the hiring of an agent, the Servicer, to manage the underlying collateral. In Chapter 2, Multiple Tranches, Information Asymettry and the Impediments to Mortgage Renegotiation, I first develop a simple conceptual framework to outline the channels via which multiple claim-holders induce fewer than optimal loan modification by worsening the agency problem between mortgage Servicers and RMBS Sponsors. Then, using within deal variation in the number and structure of tranches, I find that loans in pools collateralizing fewer tranches are more likely to be modified conditional upon being seriously delinquent. I also find that modified loans in such loan pools were likely to receive more aggressive loan modifications. The results provide evidence for one channel via which the securitization of mortgages inhibited the renegotiation of delinquent mortgages in the wake of the housing crisis, and complement the results of Chapter 1. In Chapter 3, Partial Deregulation and Competition: Evidence from Risky Mortgage Origination, co-authored with Amir Kermani (University of California, Berkeley) and Marco Di Maggio (Harvard University), we exploit the OCC's preemption of national banks from state laws against predatory lending as a quasi-experiment to study the effect of deregulation and its interaction with competition on the supply of complex mortgages. Following the preemption ruling, national banks significantly increased their origination of loans with prepayment penalties by comparison with national banks in states without predatory-lending laws. We highlight a competition channel: in counties where OCC-regulated lenders had larger market shares, non-OCC lenders responded by increasing their use of riskier contract features, such as deferred amortization, adjustable rates and interest-only payments, which were not restricted by the state predatory-lending laws...|$|E
