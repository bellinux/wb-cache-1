50|$|The {{book has}} served as a ‘vaseela’, medium of spiritual {{elevation}} towards divinity for many Sufi saints <b>both</b> many <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> are quite famous all over the world.

40|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} on eight sets of monozygous and nine sets of dizygous female Negro twins, <b>both</b> members <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> were heterozygous for G- 6 -PD deficiency. Twins were studied <b>both</b> by assay <b>of</b> erythrocytic G- 6 -PD activity and by the methemoglobin elution test (MET). The MET is a procedure which identifies histochemically cells with appreciable G- 6 -PD activity and permits accurate determination {{of the percentage of}} such cells in heterozygotes. Monozygous twins showed significantly less “within-pair” variation than dizygous twins with both the MET and G- 6 -PD assay...|$|R

5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} Australia's finest ever wicket-keepers, Tallon was {{lean and}} {{relatively}} tall for a wicket-keeper, standing 180cm. Tallon's high acclaim among cricket pundits derived from his style, rather than raw statistics. In 21 Tests, Tallon kept wicket in 41 innings, making 58 dismissals {{at an average of}} 1.41 per innings. Modern Australian glovemen such as Rod Marsh and Ian Healy, <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> held the Test world record for dismissals, averaged closer to two. Tallon's Test batting average of 17.13 pales in comparison to that of contemporary wicket-keepers such as Australia's Adam Gilchrist and Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara, <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> have made a double century and more than ten centuries. English wicket-keepers from two decades after World War II such as Godfrey Evans and Jim Parks scored two Test centuries apiece and averaged substantially more than Tallon.|$|E

5000|$|During {{times of}} great upheavals, nature {{finds a way}} to expel the magic rock to restore the balance between good and evil and seeks out a host to wield its great power and {{champion}} its cause. (There seems to be a possibility that this power source may be the same as Darna's and Lastikman's, <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom's</b> origins also involved magic [...] "falling stars"). The champions it chooses are usually those who have been victims of society's evils, the disenfranchised, and the meek ones. This is why the power found four social outcast individuals to wield its abilities. But there is a condition: the wielder must only use the power for unselfish purposes and the good of humanity. The abuse of this power holds dire consequences. Unfortunately, when the rock first hit the Earth and got absorbed into the ground, fragments of the rock broke off and in the wrong hands could be very destructive. This is exactly what happened when (in addition to Enteng) extra fragments homed in on the beings that eventually became [...] "Lagablab", [...] "Freezy", and [...] "Dagampatay".|$|R

50|$|Laurie Daley {{would have}} his own share of injury headaches, as twins and right side wing-centre pairing Brett Morris and Josh Morris were {{ultimately}} ruled out with injuries sustained from game one. Daley would choose Will Hopoate and Josh Dugan as the respective replacements, <b>both</b> players <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> debuted in 2011 as centre and fullback but were instead selected to play in unfamiliar positions. Unavailable for the first game due to suspension, Greg Bird returns to the side as lock, shifting Paul Gallen to the front row whilst James Tamou replaced Tony Williams on the interchange.|$|R

5|$|Although the xx {{had been}} {{strongly}} influenced by R acts, the album also drew comparisons from critics to alternative rock, electronica, and post-punk sounds. The melancholic songs on xx featured minimalist arrangements and were built around Smith's beats, Oliver Sim's basslines, and sparse guitar figures played by Baria Qureshi and Romy Madley Croft, who employed reverb in her lead guitar parts. Most of them were sung as low-key duets by Croft and Sim, <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> wrote emotional lyrics about love, intimacy, loss, and desire.|$|E
