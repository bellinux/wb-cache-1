40|$|Introduction: The first <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> were {{developed}} 30 years ago. <b>Biopharmaceuticals</b> {{differ significantly from}} small molecule therapeutics (SMTs). Because of such differences, {{it was expected that}} classical preclinical safety evaluation procedures applied to SMTs would not predict the adverse effects of <b>biopharmaceuticals.</b> Therefore, until sufficient experience was gained, the preclinical safety evaluation of <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> was carried out on a case-by-case basis. 30 years of experience has since expanded the knowledge base in this area, in the hope to design a preclinical safety evaluation procedure suited to <b>biopharmaceuticals.</b> Areas covered: This review describes how the preclinical safety evaluation of <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> has evolved. It shows that, as result of the risk-averse behavior of regulators and industry, classical procedures were taken as starting point although state-of-the-art knowledge on <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> was directed towards creating a new procedure, driven by the specific properties of <b>biopharmaceuticals.</b> Expert opinion: Current preclinical safety evaluation guidance of <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> is criticized because it employs a checkbox approach. The adverse effects induced by <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> are on-target or immune system [...] induced, therefore, the preclinical safety evaluation should not be standardized, but rather driven by product specific safety concerns...|$|R
40|$|Compared with {{chemically}} synthesized small-molecule drugs, {{the manufacturing}} process of <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> is more complex. Unexpected changes to product characteristics following manufacturing changes {{have given rise to}} calls for robust systems to monitor the postauthorization safety of <b>biopharmaceuticals.</b> We compared quality-related product recalls in the USA of <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> and of small wmolecules. Although the reasons for recalls for <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> differed from those for small molecules, adverse events were rarely reported. The relative contribution of recalls that could cause serious adverse health consequences was not greater for <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> than for small molecules. Therefore, these data do not give rise to concerns that <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> are more frequently associated with unexpected safety concerns...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{importance of}} <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> {{for the management}} of life threatening diseases is increasing but costs have become a major obstacle to the administration of these medicines, especially in resource limited healthcare systems. Introduction of biosimilars as a cost-effective alternative to innovator <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> has attracted the attention of both industry and policymakers. However, due to the complex structures of <b>biopharmaceuticals,</b> the regulation of biosimilars has become challenging for national regulatory authorities. In past decade national pharmaceutical companies in Iran have manufactured copies of several brand-name <b>biopharmaceuticals.</b> Although copied <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> produced by Iranian companies have received marketing authorization for the local market, none has been evaluated using internationally recognized guidelines for the approval of ‘biosimilars’. Therefore, effective pharmacovigilance programmes are essential to evaluate whether the safety and efficacy profiles of these locally produced <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> are different from those of either the original brand <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> or their biosimilar versions...|$|R

40|$|<b>Biopharmaceuticals</b> {{differ from}} small {{molecules}} {{in terms of}} structure and pharmacology. Furthermore, they are also prescribed for different patient populations. The protein nature of <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> makes them especially prone for immunological reactions and their safety profile may be affected by seemingly minor changes in the production process. This unpredictability of safety concerns of <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> has triggered increased regulatory interest {{in the safety of}} <b>biopharmaceuticals,</b> which has increased {{as a result of the}} arrival of competing version of biopahrmaceuticals, so-called ‘biosimilars’. In thesis <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> are studied as challenges to the regulatory system, through the analysis of safety concerns of <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> and the ability of existing regulatory instruments to deal with these issues. This thesis is divided in three chapters covering different themes: (1) mechanisms of adverse events of <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> and the consequences for risk management strategies, (2) challenges posed by the arrival of biosimilars and (3) strategies to study regulatory processes. Novel regulatory and pharmacovigilance tools have provided regulators with new tools to optimize risk management of <b>biopharmaceuticals.</b> We have found that, despite clear differences in the nature of post authoroziation safety events between <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> and small molecules, these differences were not reflected by differences in the source of these regulatory actions. The knowledge that has been gained with <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> is being translated into tools to facilitate their safety management. Based on the knowledge of a product, how it interacts with its target, and likely immunological ADRs, a carefully designed pharmacovigilance strategy taking a case-by-case approach should determine the optimal toolkit to establish the benefit risk profile of <b>biopharmaceuticals.</b> European regulations outlining the approval criteria for biosimilars have been in place since 2005 and since then 14 biosimilar products have received marketing authorization. Several questions remain about their safety profile and they are subject to extensive post authorization requirements. We argue that the scope of post authorization risk management should be limited to immunogenicity associated adverse events. We reviewed several data sources and did not identify safety events associated with switching between <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> within the same class. We identify that challenges remain to develop biosimilars in oncology, in order to allow the development of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies it may be necessary to identify novel endpoints of the comparability exercise. We evaluated the role of periodic safety update reports (PSURs) as regulatory instruments to monitor the safety of <b>biopharmaceuticals.</b> We found that it remains a challenge to determine their contribution to the safe use of medicines as ancillary to existing pharmacovigilance requirements. Furthermore we performed a cost effectiveness analysis of PSUR reporting for <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> in Europe. Our data suggest that it is unlikely that the costs of PSUR reporting for <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> outweighed its health gains. We conclude that regulations should be standard accompanied with a plan to assess their effects. We present a model that may be instrumental in gaining insight in the efficiency of regulatory instruments in achieving predefined objectives and to monitor the performance of new and/or existing regulatory requirements...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to select the most {{interesting}} Brazilian <b>biopharmaceuticals,</b> with the best market opportunity for production. The <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> filgrastim, infliximab, somatropin, imiglucerase, betainterferon and factor VIII were selected because they are not produced in Brazil and thus could increase the technological capacity of domestic production. The use of a data mining tool facilitated the results achieved here, using the patents deposited in several banks worldwide as the source information. The prospects and trends of producing <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> in Brazil are of great interest to the country to establish a competitive industry and reduce the vulnerability of the National Health System, such as display windows of opportunity, showing the possibility of moving towards the production of <b>biopharmaceuticals...</b>|$|R
