A marinier stood {{on the front of}} the barge {{steering}} it with a wooden pole. Lock-keepers operated the locks and helped manoeuver the barges using a <b>boat</b> <b>hook.</b> Porters loaded and unloaded the barges. They were called crocheteurs after the iron hooks that they used to move bales of goods.|$|E
5|$|Bean was not {{the first}} actor to be chosen to play Sharpe. As Paul McGann was injured while playing {{football}} two days into filming, the producers initially tried to work around his injury, but it proved impossible and Bean replaced him. The series ran continuously from 1993 to 1997, with three episodes produced each year. It was filmed under challenging conditions, first in Ukraine and later in Portugal. After several years of rumours, more episodes were produced: Sharpe's Challenge, which aired in April 2006, and Sharpe's Peril, which aired in autumn 2008 and was later released on DVD. Both of these were released as two cinema-length 90 minute episodes per series. With a role as enigmatic Lord Richard Fenton in the TV miniseries Scarlett, Bean made the transition to Hollywood feature films. His first notable Hollywood appearance was that of an Irish republican terrorist in the 1992 film adaptation of Patriot Games. While filming his death scene, Harrison Ford hit him with a <b>boat</b> <b>hook,</b> giving him a permanent scar. Bean's rough-cut looks made him a patent choice for a villain, and his role in Patriot Games was the first of several villains that he would portray, all of whom die in gruesome ways.|$|E
500|$|Manhattan {{had closed}} to about [...] {{distance}} when Nicholson spotted a white flag of surrender {{hanging from a}} <b>boat</b> <b>hook</b> {{on top of the}} Tennessees casemate and ordered his gunners to cease fire. Nicholson confirmed the Confederate ship's surrender verbally and ran the monitor alongside so that one of his officers could seize the ironclad's colors, which was lying in her scuppers.|$|E

5000|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} is {{from modern}} times; they were granted in 1987. The arms are red with three gold-colored <b>boat</b> <b>hooks.</b> This design {{was chosen to}} symbolise the importance of sailing and shipping along the Hardangerfjord.

50|$|Like many towns on {{the marsh}} {{it has an}} {{impressive}} Norman church in the centre of town.

2500|$|... "At {{this moment}} I believe neither Captain Bligh of the Bounty, nor Christian, had entered {{any of our}} thoughts, and in waiting the {{approach}} of the strangers, we prepared to ask them some questions in the language of those people we had so recently left. They came —and for me to picture the wonder which was conspicuous in every countenance, at being hailed in perfect English, what {{was the name of the}} ship, and who commanded her, would be impossible—our surprize can alone be conceived. The Captain answered, and now a regular conversation commenced. He requested them to come alongside, and the reply was, [...] " [...] We have no <b>boat</b> <b>hook</b> to hold on by." [...] "I will throw you a rope" [...] said the Captain. [...] "If you do we have nothing to make it fast to" [...] was the answer. However, they at length came on board, exemplifying not the least fear, but their astonishment was unbounded." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the Roger B. Taney sank, LoPresti and {{the other}} Naval Armed Guards {{abandoned}} the ship on rafts, which were picked {{up the next morning}} by the lifeboats. [...] He was one of 26 men who took refuge in the number 4 lifeboat with minimal water or food supplies\ name="PodnieksPlayers" [...] /> The lifeboat was sailed to the South American coast in a voyage of 42 days, traveling nearly [...] southwest, before they were found and rescued off the coast of Brazil. They had collected rain water when they could, at times drinking only [...] per day and had only a small amount of biscuits and bakers chocolate for food. LoPresti was credited with saving the men's lives by catching the only real food they had during their entire ordeal after noticing dolphins swimming around their boat on one occasion. [...] According to another sailor, LoPresti improvised a weapon by lashing a sheath knife to a <b>boat</b> <b>hook.</b> [...] He plunged into the ocean, catching a [...] dolphin. [...] They hauled it into the boat, drank its blood, and cooked the meat in a metal bucket with rags and kerosene.|$|E

50|$|A {{volunteer}} fire department {{was established in}} Jabłonna in April 1912. The first unit of firefighters was equipped with a manual pump, hoses, ladders, <b>boat</b> <b>hooks,</b> buckets, axes and hatchets.

60|$|Two {{of their}} number {{had gone down}} before the captain's revolver. They lay where they had fallen between the combatants. But then the first mate lunged forward upon his face, and at a cry of command from Black Michael the mutineers charged the {{remaining}} four. The crew {{had been able to}} muster but six firearms, so most of them were armed with <b>boat</b> <b>hooks,</b> axes, hatchets and crowbars.|$|R

50|$|Women and {{children}} of all ages were bound and thrown from a high bank into the Volkhov river where they were trapped under the ice. Soldiers patrolled the water in boats, armed with <b>boat</b> <b>hooks,</b> spears, lances and axes, pushing down anyone who managed to surface alive. Those condemned by the court, after enduring questions under torture, were often tied to sleds and dragged through town until they too were forced off the bridge into the river.|$|R
6000|$|The {{fishermen}} in that other <b>boat</b> <b>hooked</b> a fish and broke it off. We saw from the excitement on board {{that they had}} realized the enormous size of these tuna. We hurried to get ready again. It was only needful to drag a bait anywhere near that school. And we alternated with the other boat. I saw those fishermen get four more strikes and lose the four fish immediately. I had even worse luck. In fact, disaster grew and grew. But {{there is no need}} for me to multiply these instances. The last three tunas I hooked broke the double line on the first run. This when I had on only a slight drag! ...|$|R
50|$|There is {{no public}} access to this lake.

60|$|In {{another moment}} Macallister {{contrived}} {{to get his}} <b>boat</b> <b>hook</b> into the slack of Austin's garments, and when two seamen seized the haft they hove him out, wrong side uppermost, and incoherent with wrath. When they dropped him, a tattered, dripping heap, on the deck, Miss Gascoyne leaned her face upon her hands, and laughed almost hysterically, until Jacinta touched her shoulder.|$|E
60|$|I gave a wild shout; Walkirk dashed {{out of his}} bunk; {{there was}} a call from above; then I felt a shock, and our boat keeled over on her {{starboard}} side. In a moment, however, she receded from the other vessel, and righted herself. I {{do not know that}} Walkirk had ever read in a book what he ought to do in such an emergency, but he seized a <b>boat</b> <b>hook</b> and pushed our boat away from the larger vessel.|$|E

60|$|During this talk, Israel's curiosity had {{prompted}} him to dart up the ladder from the main-deck, and stand right in the gangway above, looking out on the strange craft. Meantime the order {{had been given to}} drop a boat. Thinking this a favorable chance, he stationed himself so that he should be the foremost to spring into the boat; though crowds of English sailors, eager as himself for the same opportunity to escape from foreign service, clung to the chains of the as yet imperfectly disciplined man-of-war. As the two men who had been lowered in the <b>boat</b> <b>hooked</b> her, when afloat, along to the gangway, Israel dropped like a comet into the stern-sheets, stumbled forward, and seized an oar. In a moment more, all the oarsmen were in their places, and with a few strokes the boat lay alongside the cutter.|$|R
60|$|Austin set his lips, {{and swam}} for the gangway as the Estremedura rolled down. His flung up hand came within {{a foot of}} the opening, and then he sank back a fathom or more below it as the Estremedura hove that side of {{her out of the}} water. When he swung up again Macallister was {{standing}} above him with a portentiously sharp <b>boat</b> <b>hook,</b> while two or three grinning seamen clustered round. The girls were also leaning out from the saloon-deck rails.|$|E

I will creep into the gig before that and hide myself as well as I can under your thwart, and all you have got to do is to take no notice of me. When the boat is lowered I think they will hardly make me out from the deck, {{especially}} as you will be standing up in the bow holding on with the <b>boat</b> <b>hook</b> till the rest get on board." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Polly, {{freed from}} the sense of urgent pursuit, had halted beyond the {{raspberry}} canes and rallied his courage. The sense of Uncle Jim victorious in the house restored his manhood. He went round by the outhouses to the riverside, seeking a weapon, and found an old paddle <b>boat</b> <b>hook.</b> With this he smote Uncle Jim as he emerged by {{the door of the}} tap. Uncle Jim, blaspheming dreadfully and with dire stabbing intimations in either hand, came through the splintering paddle like a circus rider through a paper hoop, and once more Mr. Polly dropped his weapon and fled.|$|E

60|$|As, at last, the <b>boat</b> was <b>hooked</b> {{from the}} bow along toward the gangway amidship, its keel, while yet some inches {{separated}} from the hull, harshly grated as on a sunken coral reef. It proved a huge bunch of conglobated barnacles adhering below the water to the side like a wen--a token of baffling airs and long calms passed somewhere in those seas.|$|R
5|$|In March 2006, Mills and McCartney {{travelled}} to Canada {{to bring}} attention to the country's annual seal hunt. Sponsored by the Humane Society of the United States, they complained that the hunt was inhumane, and called on the Canadian government {{to put an end}} to it. Their arrival on the floes sparked much attention in Newfoundland and Labrador, where 90 per cent of the sealers live. Mills and McCartney protested against seals being clubbed to death, pierced with <b>boat</b> <b>hooks</b> and sometimes skinned alive. Newfoundland and Labrador's Premier, Danny Williams, debated the issue with them on Larry King Live, the issue being that seals are no longer hunted that way, and have not been for a while. Mills joined a Viva! film team at a pig farm in Somerset, in February 2007, to publicise the use of restrictive farrowing crates, which are used for sows who are suckling piglets. A video of the investigation was made available on the Internet.|$|R
60|$|The {{excitement}} of this scene was very great, and Rollo's first {{impulse was to}} scream for help; but observing how cool and collected Gerald appeared, he felt somewhat reassured, and at once obeyed Gerald's orders. He took in his oar, and holding it in his hands, {{as if it had}} been a <b>boat</b> <b>hook</b> or a setting pole, he prepared to fend off from the piers when the boat went through. In the mean time Gerald had succeeded in getting the boat round, so as to point the bows down stream, just as she reached the bridge; and in this position she shot under it like an arrow. Several boys who were standing on the bridge at this time, after watching at the upper side till the boat went under, ran across to the lower side, to see her come out.|$|E
60|$|When {{the moon}} rose slowly {{out of the}} sea he stopped the clanking engine and the launch reeled up and down, some fifty yards off the steamer. The Rio Negro carried no lights, but the {{phosphorescence}} shone upon her wet plates as she rolled them out of the water. Her side rose high and black, and then sank until her rail was nearly level with the spangled foam. Indistinct figures scrambled about her deck, and when Kit sheered the launch in, her ladder went down with a rattle. A half-breed on board the launch caught it with his <b>boat</b> <b>hook,</b> and Adam stood at the bow, waiting for a chance to jump upon the narrow platform that lurched up above him and then plunged into the sea. Kit felt anxious. He did not think Adam was equal to the effort and dreaded the consequences of the shock if he missed and fell.|$|E
60|$|Wolfert and {{his companions}} shrunk back is dismay. Still their curiosity would not allow them entirely to withdraw. A long sheet of {{lightning}} now flickered across the waves, and discovered a boat, filled with men, just under a rocky point, rising and sinking with the heavy surges, and swashing the water at every heave. It was with difficulty held to the rocks by a <b>boat</b> <b>hook,</b> for the current rushed furiously round the point. The veteran hoisted {{one end of the}} lumbering sea-chest on the gunwale of the boat; he seized the handle at the other end to lift it in, when the motion propelled the boat from the shore; the chest slipped off from the gunwale, sunk into the waves, and pulled the veteran headlong after it. A loud shriek was uttered by all on shore, and a volley of execrations by those on board; but boat and man were hurried away by the rushing swiftness of the tide. A pitchy darkness succeeded; Wolfert Webber indeed fancied that He distinguished a cry for help, and that he beheld the drowning man beckoning for assistance; but when the lightning again gleamed along the water all was drear and void. Neither man nor boat was to be seen; nothing but the dashing and weltering of the waves as they hurried past.|$|E
