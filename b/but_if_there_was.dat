Cliff Williams' trademark instrument is the StingRay and other basses by Music Man, strung with D'Addario (.045, [...]065, [...]085, [...]105) flatwounds {{in the studio and}} roundwound XLs in concert. Williams states that despite trying other basses over the years, he always went back to Music Man's instruments, which he described as [...] "a tremendous work horse of a bass". Other basses used include the Fender Precision Bass, a Gibson Thunderbird non-reverse, Fender Jazz Bass, the Steinberger L-series, a Gibson EB-3 and at least two LAG Custom basses. Williams used 3 Ampeg SVT-810E cabinets with 2 SVT-4PRO Heads, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any interference with the wireless systems, he used cables in his live performances.|$|E

There is also a [...] "How To Draw Manga" [...] page. In addition, there are games, including quizzes, the New Prophecy Adventure, and the Warriors Adventure Game. On the Frequently Asked Questions section of the site, Erin Hunter said that they are working on an online game that would be released in late 2010. It finished the first round of testing in summer 2010, but has not been released. Whether it will be a role-playing game is unknown. Erin Hunter has stated on the official Warriors website that there is still no plan for an official video game, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was,</b> it would probably be based on a movie version of the Warriors series, which is currently not under consideration. Many fans have also created their own forum-based role-playing games.|$|E

[...] Wray moved to the story department at Fox Studios in 1936.

2500|$|No more {{has been}} {{heard of the}} rest of the {{triptych}} since the mentions below in the Provenance. [...] It would presumably have been an altarpiece, for a side-altar or small chapel. [...] The subjects of the other missing panels remain uncertain; a Nativity or Adoration of the Magi are considered most likely for the central panel, at least twice as wide as this one, with a Visitation of Mary or Presentation of Jesus on the right-hand wing matching this one. [...] The outer sides of the wings would probably have been painted in some fashion, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a full scene, or even a figure in grisaille on the back of this, it is unlikely it would have been discarded when the painting was transferred to canvas in the 19th century.

2500|$|Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave The Flash episode an 8.4 out of 10. He said, [...] "As expected, {{there was}} a ton of appeal in seeing so many heroes joining forces on the small screen. But without a {{well-defined}} enemy to unify these heroes, it was often the Flashpoint-related character drama that propelled this first act." [...] Schedeen added, [...] "Everyone had their moment to shine, even more minor players like Felicity and Thea. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> one subplot that felt unnecessary and out of place, it was Wally's," [...] calling it [...] "forced". He also appreciated the focus on fall out from Flashpoint, calling it [...] "one of the biggest flaws of Season 3 so far" [...] on The Flash, and hoped more of the Dominators' comic backstory would come into play {{in the other two}} episodes of the crossover. The A.V. Clubs Scott Von Doviak awarded the episode a [...] "B+", saying [...] "Even by the usual standards of a CW superhero crossover, [...] "Invasion!" [...] is an absurdly overstuffed kickoff to a three-night event. Not only does the episode bring the casts of four different shows together, with all the tangled relationships that entails, it also continues to advance the story arcs of this season of The Flash and finds a way to weave those ongoing conflicts into the multi-series story of an alien invasion." [...] However, Von Doviak questioned some of the events of the episodes, such as Barry being knowledgable of the Legends adventures and not caring about secret identities, and felt viewers [...] "who don't necessarily follow the other three shows religiously are at a disadvantage".|$|E
