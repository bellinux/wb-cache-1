25|$|Most of the Zoroastrian, Greek, Hellenistic, Buddhist, Hindu {{and other}} {{indigenous}} cultures {{were replaced by}} the coming of Islam and little influence remains in Afghanistan today. Along ancient trade routes, however, stone monuments of the once flourishing Buddhist culture did exist as reminders of the past. The two massive sandstone Buddhas of Bamyan, thirty-five and fifty-three meters high overlooked the ancient route through Bamyan to Balkh and dated from the 3rd and 5th centuries. They survived until 2001, when they were destroyed by the Taliban. In this and other key places in Afghanistan, archaeologists have located frescoes, stucco decorations, statuary, and rare objects {{from as far away}} as China, Phoenicia, and Rome, which were crafted as early as the 2nd century and <b>bear</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> influence of these ancient civilizations upon Afghanistan.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} Compline {{has given rise}} to {{considerable}} discussion among liturgists. In the past, general opinion ascribed the origin of this Hour to St. Benedict, {{in the beginning of the}} 6th century. But Jules Pargoire and A. Vandepitte trace its source to St. Basil. Vandepitte states that it was not in Cæsarea in 375, but in his retreat in Pontus (358-362), that Basil established Compline, which Hour did not exist prior to his time, that is, until shortly after the middle of the 4th century. Dom Plaine also traced the source of Compline back to the 4th century, finding mention of it in a passage in Eusebius and in another in St. Ambrose, and also in John Cassian.These texts <b>bear</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> private custom of saying a prayer before retiring to rest. If this was not the canonical Hour of Compline, it was certainly a preliminary step towards it. The same writers reject the opinion of Paulin Ladeuze and Dom Besse who believe that Compline had a place in the Rule of St. Pachomius, which would mean that it originated still earlier in the 4th century.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of these}} centers {{developed}} to their apogees in the Preclassic period before declining or disappearing. In {{addition to these}} large sites, many Early Preclassic communities, found mostly along the Pacific Coast, <b>bear</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> seminal character of the Southern area; notably these include La Victoria, a site studied by Michael Coe that yielded the first secure ceramic sequence from early on in Preclassic times. Since Coe’s work, John E. Clark and other scholars from the New World Archaeological Foundation have found, at Paso de la Amada and other sites, ceramics that refine and deepen in time Coe’s sequence, pushing back to ca. 2000 BC the earliest nuclear centers, fine pottery, figurines, and other manifestations of the beginnings of complex society and culture in Mesoamerica. The earliest pristine ballcourt and evidence of a ranked society (a rich child's burial), indicative of emerging social hierarchization, were found at Paso de la Amada and nearby. At La Blanca, archaeologists discovered a quatrefoil made of baked clay buried near Mound 1, {{one of the largest}} and earliest temple mounds in Mesoamerica, indicating an early fount of what later became core Maya ideology.|$|E
25|$|The 11th-century eastern Qur'anic {{manuscript}} {{contains the}} 20th juz’ (section) of a Qurʼan that originally consisted of 30 parts. The arrangement into 30 parts {{corresponds to the}} number of days in the month of Ramadan, during which the Muslim is obliged to fast and to read through the whole of the Qurʼan. Other sections or fragments of this magnificent manuscript lie scattered in various collections all over the world. A Turkish note ascribes the Qurʼan to the hand of the Caliph Ali, Muhammad’s cousin and son-in-law, and thus demonstrates the high significance of this manuscript. The text is written in Eastern Kufic, a monumental script that was developed in Iran in the late 10th century. The writing and the illumination of the manuscript <b>bear</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> great artistic skills of the calligrapher and the illustrator. The manuscript is at the Bavarian State Library in Munich, Germany. Out of seven complete or nearly complete semi-Kufic Qur'ans from {{before the end of the}} eleventh century, four contain a verse count. Although admittedly a small sample,it does suggest that the use of a verse count was a prevalent and quite deeply rooted practice in semi-Kufic Qur'ans between ca. 950 and ca. 1100.|$|E
