5|$|In a DNA double helix, {{each type}} of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called {{complementary}} <b>base</b> <b>pairing.</b> Here, purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of <b>base</b> <b>pairing</b> is Hoogsteen <b>base</b> <b>pairing</b> where two hydrogen bonds form between guanine and cytosine. As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As {{a result of this}} base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|Two {{chains of}} DNA twist {{around each other}} to form a DNA double helix with the phosphate-sugar {{backbone}} spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine <b>base</b> <b>pairing</b> to thymine and guanine to cytosine. The specificity of <b>base</b> <b>pairing</b> occurs because adenine and thymine align to form two hydrogen bonds, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{double-stranded}} DNA, RNA is a single-stranded molecule {{in many of}} its biological {{roles and}} has a much shorter chain of nucleotides. However, RNA can, by complementary <b>base</b> <b>pairing,</b> form intrastrand (i.e., single-strand) double helixes, as in tRNA.|$|E
30|$|Current {{algorithms}} {{prefer to}} consider the canonical <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> (A–U, C–G, and G–U <b>base</b> <b>pairs)</b> in RNA secondary structure predictions. However, there are nearly 10 % of the 2028 native <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> that are non-canonical <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> (A–G, A–C, A–A, U–U, C–U, C–C, and G–G <b>base</b> <b>pairs).</b> This implies that the prediction accuracy of <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> cannot be higher than 90 % by using current secondary structure prediction methods.|$|R
40|$|Most of the hairpin, {{internal}} and junction loops that appear single-stranded in standard RNA secondary structures form recurrent 3 D motifs, where non-Watson–Crick <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> {{play a central}} role. Non-Watson–Crick <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> also play crucial roles in tertiary contacts in structured RNA molecules. We previously classified RNA <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> geometrically so as to group together those <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> that are structurally similar (isosteric) and therefore able to substitute for each other by mutation without disrupting the 3 D structure. Here, we introduce a quantitative measure of <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> isostericity, the IsoDiscrepancy Index (IDI), to more accurately determine which <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> substitutions can potentially occur in conserved motifs. We extract and classify <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> from a reduced-redundancy set of RNA 3 D structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and calculate centroids (exemplars) for each base combination and geometric <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> type (family). We use the exemplars and IDI values to update our online Basepair Catalog and the Isostericity Matrices (IM) for each <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> family. From the database of <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> observed in 3 D structures we derive <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> occurrence frequencies {{for each of the}} 12 geometric <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> families. In order to improve the statistics from the 3 D structures, we also derive <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> occurrence frequencies from rRNA sequence alignments...|$|R
40|$|Mutations that {{increase}} {{the activity of the}} promoter for the antirepressor gene of phage P 22 were isolated by pseudoreversion of four severe promoter-down mutations. The sequence changes in these pseudorevertants include single <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> substitutions, single <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> deletions, tandem double <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> deletions and multisite mutations. The single <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> substitutions change nonconsensus <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> to consensus <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> at positions - 14 and - 8. The other mutations provide support for the idea that the length of the spacer region between the conserved - 35 and - 10 hexamers is an important determinant of promoter strength. Deletions of one or two <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> in the spacer region apparently activate an alternate - 10 hexamer by shifting it from a spacing of 19 <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> to a spacing of 18 or 17 <b>base</b> <b>pairs,</b> respectively...|$|R
5|$|In biology, Holliday {{junctions}} {{are a key}} intermediate in {{many types}} of genetic recombination, {{as well as in}} double-strand break repair. These junctions usually have a symmetrical sequence and are thus mobile, meaning that the four individual arms may slide through the junction in a specific pattern that largely preserves <b>base</b> <b>pairing.</b> Additionally, four-arm junctions similar to Holliday junctions appear in some functional RNA molecules.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins. At {{the very end of}} the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and <b>base</b> <b>pairing</b> to one of the two strands. This triple-stranded structure is called a displacement loop or D-loop.|$|E
5|$|Dirks' work in {{computational}} chemistry involved creating algorithms and computational {{tools for}} the analysis of nucleic acid thermodynamics and nucleic acid structure prediction. Dirks wrote the initial code for the NUPACK suite of nucleic acid design and analysis tools, which generates <b>base</b> <b>pairing</b> probabilities through calculation of the statistical partition function. Unlike other structure prediction tools, NUPACK is capable of handling an arbitrary number of interacting strands rather than being limited to one or two. Dirks also developed an algorithm capable of efficiently handling certain types of pseudoknots, a class of structure that is more computationally intensive to analyze, although NUPACK only implements this ability for single RNA strands.|$|E

Putative <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> that exhibited two 'compensatory <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> changes' (a requisite as dictated by the approach of 'comparative sequence data analysis') were picked up. Potential <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> were selected by assessing the frequency and taxonomy specificity of the occurrence of compensatory <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> changes against those of other types of <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> changes. The selected <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> were classified as universal, non-mitochondrial, and prokaryote-specific.

5|$|In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases {{make copies}} of DNA polynucleotide chains. To {{preserve}} biological information, {{it is essential that}} the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of <b>base</b> <b>pairing</b> between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.|$|E
5|$|Nucleic acid {{design has}} similar goals to protein design. In both, the {{sequence}} of monomers is designed to favor the desired target structure and to disfavor other structures. Nucleic acid design {{has the advantage of}} being much computationally easier than protein design, because the simple <b>base</b> <b>pairing</b> rules are sufficient to predict a structure's energetic favorability, and detailed information about the overall three-dimensional folding of the structure is not required. This allows the use of simple heuristic methods that yield experimentally robust designs. Nucleic acid structures are less versatile than proteins in their function because of proteins' increased ability to fold into complex structures, and the limited chemical diversity of the four nucleotides as compared to the twenty proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Translesion {{synthesis}} (TLS) is a DNA {{damage tolerance}} process {{that allows the}} DNA replication machinery to replicate past DNA lesions such as thymine dimers or AP sites. It involves switching out regular DNA polymerases for specialized translesion polymerases (i.e. DNA polymerase IV or V, from the Y Polymerase family), often with larger active sites that can facilitate the insertion of bases opposite damaged nucleotides. The polymerase switching {{is thought to be}} mediated by, among other factors, the post-translational modification of the replication processivity factor PCNA. Translesion synthesis polymerases often have low fidelity (high propensity to insert wrong bases) on undamaged templates relative to regular polymerases. However, many are extremely efficient at inserting correct bases opposite specific types of damage. For example, Pol η mediates error-free bypass of lesions induced by UV irradiation, whereas Pol ι introduces mutations at these sites. Pol η is known to add the first adenine across the T^T photodimer using Watson-Crick <b>base</b> <b>pairing</b> and the second adenine will be added in its syn conformation using Hoogsteen <b>base</b> <b>pairing.</b> From a cellular perspective, risking the introduction of point mutations during translesion synthesis may be preferable to resorting to more drastic mechanisms of DNA repair, which may cause gross chromosomal aberrations or cell death. In short, the process involves specialized polymerases either bypassing or repairing lesions at locations of stalled DNA replication. For example, Human DNA polymerase eta can bypass complex DNA lesions like guanine-thymine intra-strand crosslink, GT, although can cause targeted and semi-targeted mutations. Paromita Raychaudhury and Ashis Basu studied the toxicity and mutagenesis of the same lesion in Escherichia coli by replicating a GT-modified plasmid in E. coli with specific DNA polymerase knockouts. Viability was very low in a strain lacking pol II, pol IV, and pol V, the three SOS-inducible DNA polymerases, indicating that translesion synthesis is conducted primarily by these specialized DNA polymerases.|$|E
40|$|The 2 -aminopurine-induced transition, A·T → G·C, was {{studied at}} {{particular}} sites in bacteriophage T 4 {{as a function}} of the nearby base-pair composition of the DNA.

Destabilization was achieved by replacing an A·T <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> by a G·C <b>base</b> <b>pair...</b>|$|R
40|$|In our {{previous}} communication we reported the enzymatic recognition of unnatural imidazopyridopyrimidine:naphthyridine (Im:Na) <b>base</b> <b>pairs,</b> i. e. ImON:NaNO and ImNO:NaON, using the Klenow fragment exo− [KF (exo−) ]. We describe herein the successful results of (i) improved enzymatic recognition for ImNO:NaON <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> and (ii) further primer extension reactions after the Im:Na <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> by Deep Vent DNA polymerase exo− [Deep Vent (exo−) ]. Since KF (exo−) did not catalyze primer extension reactions after the Im:Na <b>base</b> <b>pair,</b> we {{carried out a}} screening of DNA polymerases to promote the primer extension reaction {{as well as to}} improve the selectivity of <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> recognition. As a result, a family B DNA polymerase, especially Deep Vent (exo−), seemed most promising for this purpose. In the ImON:NaNO <b>base</b> <b>pair,</b> incorporation of NaNOTP against ImON in the template was preferable to that of the natural dNTPs, while incorporation of dATP as well as dGTP competed with that of ImONTP when NaNO was placed in the template. Thus, the selectivity of <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> recognition by Deep Vent (exo−) was less than that by KF (exo−) {{in the case of the}} ImON:NaNO <b>base</b> <b>pair.</b> On the other hand, incorporation of NaONTP against ImNO in the template and that of ImNOTP against NaON were both quite selective. Thus, the selectivity of <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> recognition was improved by Deep Vent (exo−) in the ImNO:NaON <b>base</b> <b>pair.</b> Moreover, this enzyme catalyzed further primer extension reactions after the ImNO:NaON <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> to afford a faithful replicate, which was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as well as the kinetics data for extension fidelity next to the ImNO:NaON <b>base</b> <b>pair.</b> The results presented in this paper revealed that the ImNO:NaON <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> might be a third <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> beyond the Watson–Crick <b>base</b> <b>pairs...</b>|$|R

5|$|Cell {{division}} {{is essential for}} an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary <b>base</b> <b>pairing</b> and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.|$|E
5|$|DNA usually {{occurs as}} linear {{chromosomes}} in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. The set of chromosomes {{in a cell}} makes up its genome; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes. The information carried by DNA is held in the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes. Transmission of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary <b>base</b> <b>pairing.</b> For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then {{used to make a}} matching protein sequence in a process called translation, which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here {{the focus is on the}} interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.|$|E
5|$|The two DNA strands {{are called}} polynucleotides {{since they are}} {{composed}} of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases — cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A) or thymine (T) — a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined {{to one another in}} a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to <b>base</b> <b>pairing</b> rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 trillion tons of carbon (TtC).|$|E
