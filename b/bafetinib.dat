50|$|<b>Bafetinib</b> (NS-187) is an {{experimental}} cancer drug developed by Nippon Shinyaku and licensed to CytRx. It is an inhibitor of Lyn and Bcr-Abl. It {{is currently in}} phase II clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|With the {{emerging}} resistance to imatinib treatment after its launch alternative treatment was highly sought after. <b>Bafetinib</b> was {{the offspring of}} an attempt to create a more potent drug than imatinib, with efficacy against various point mutations in the Bcr-Abl kinase, with fewer adverse effects and with narrower kinase spectra, namely just Lyn and Bcr-Abl.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{structural}} similarities of imatinib and <b>bafetinib,</b> their binding to Bcr-Abl is also quite similar. The only notable difference {{comes from the}} hydrophobic interaction between the trifluoromethyl group and the hydrophobic pocket created by Ile-293, Leu-298, Leu-354, and Val-379. This group can also be linked to bafetinib's specificity for Lyn, as the binding site there is almost identical to that on Bcr-Abl.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{tyrosine}} kinase inhibitors that target c-Src tyrosine kinase (as well as related tyrosine kinases) {{have been developed}} for therapeutic use. One notable example is dasatinib which has been approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive (PH+) acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Dasatinib is also in clinical trials for the use in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, metastatic breast cancer and prostate cancer. Other tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs that are in clinical trials include bosutinib, <b>bafetinib,</b> AZD-530, XLl-999, KX01 and XL228.|$|E
50|$|Imatinib was {{the first}} Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase {{inhibitor}} and was highly successful in treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, which had previous had no effective treatment.With the emerging resistance to imatinib treatment, alternative treatment was highly sought after. <b>Bafetinib</b> was created as an attempt for a more potent drug than imatinib, with efficacy against various point mutations in the Bcr-Abl kinase, with fewer adverse effects and with narrower kinase spectra, namely just Lyn and Bcr-Abl.In {{the search for a}} substance that fit the criteria mentioned, the crystal structure of imatinib bound to Abl was examined. This revealed a hydrophobic pocket around the phenyl ring adjacent to the piperazinylmethyl group of imatinib. Attempts to utilize this pocket to increase efficacy led to the addition of various hydrophobic groups including single fluoro, bromo and chloro substituents. Finally a trifluoromethyl group at position 3 was found to give the best results, with approximately 36-fold improvement over imatinib. The addition of a hydrophobic group now needed to be countered to sustain the solubility of the substance. Closer examination of the crystal structure of imatinib-kinase complex revealed Tyr-236 was in close proximity to the pyridine ring of imatinib, suggesting there was little or no room for a larger group there. With that in mind a more hydrophilic pyrimidine ring was substituted for the pyridine, which was found to increase solubility while leaving efficacy the same or even slightly greater. Finally to improve the hydrogen bonding of the piperazine ring of imatinib with Ile-360 and His-361, pyrrolidine and azetidine derivatives were introduced. The most promising substance from these final modifications was labeled NS-187.|$|E
40|$|Eosinophils play a {{prominent}} role in the process of allergic inflammation. Non-receptor associated Lyn tyrosine kinases generate key initial signals in eosinophils. <b>Bafetinib,</b> a specific Abl/Lyn tyrosine kinase inhibitor has shown a potent antiproliferative activity in leukemic cells, but its effects on eosinophils have not been reported. Therefore, we studied the effects of <b>bafetinib</b> on functional and mechanistic responses of isolated human eosinophils. <b>Bafetinib</b> was more potent than non-specific tyrosin kinase comparators genistein and tyrphostin inhibiting superoxide anion triggered by N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF; 100 nM) (−log IC 50 = 7. 25 ± 0. 04 M; 6. 1 ± 0. 04 M; and 6. 55 ± 0. 03 M, respectively). <b>Bafetinib,</b> genistein and tyrphostin did not modify the [Ca 2 +]i responses to fMLF. <b>Bafetinib</b> inhibited the release of EPO induced by fMLF with higher potency than genistein and tyrphostin (−log IC 50 = 7. 24 ± 0. 09 M; 5. 36 ± 0. 28 M; and 5. 37 ± 0. 19 M, respectively), and nearly suppressed LTC 4, ECP and chemotaxis. <b>Bafetinib,</b> genistein and tyrphostin did not change constitutive apoptosis. However <b>bafetinib</b> inhibited the ability of granulocyte–monocyte colony-stimulating factor to prevent apoptosis. The activation of Lyn tyrosine kinase, p-ERK 1 / 2 and p- 38 induced by fMLF was suppressed by <b>bafetinib</b> and attenuated by genistein and tyrphostin. In conclusion, <b>bafetinib</b> inhibits oxidative burst and generation of inflammatory mediators, and reverses the eosinophil survival. Therefore, future anti-allergic therapies based on <b>bafetinib,</b> could help to suppress excessive inflammatory response of eosinophils at inflammatory sites.

40|$|Background and Purpose Protease-activated {{receptor}} 2 (PAR 2) {{is expressed}} on nociceptive neurons, and can sensitize transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels to amplify neurogenic inflammation and pain. The {{mechanisms by which}} this occurs are not fully understood. PAR 2 causes receptor-operated activation of TRPV 4 channels and TRPV 4 null mice have attenuated PAR 2 -stimulated neurogenic inflammation and mechanical hyperalgesia. Here we investigate the intracellular signalling mechanisms underlying PAR 2 -induced TRPV 4 channel activation and pain. Experimental Approach Responses of non-transfected and TRPV 4 -transfected HEK 293 cells to agonists of PAR 2 (trypsin and SLIGRL) and TRPV 4 channels (GSK 1016790 A) were determined using calcium imaging. Inhibitors of TRPV 4 channels (HC 067047), sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium transport ATPase (thapsigargin), Gaq (UBO-QIC), tyrosine kinases (<b>bafetinib</b> and dasatinib) or PI 3 kinases (wortmannin and LY 294002) were used to investigate signalling mechanisms. In vivo effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on PAR 2 -induced mechanical hyperalgesia were assessed in mice. Key Results In non-transfected HEK 293 cells, PAR 2 activation transiently increased intracellular calcium ([Ca 2 +]i). Functional expression of TRPV 4 channels caused a sustained increase of [Ca 2 +]i, inhibited by HC 067047, <b>bafetinib</b> and wortmannin; but not by thapsigargin, UBO-QIC, dasatinib or LY 294002. <b>Bafetinib</b> but not dasatinib inhibited PAR 2 -induced mechanical hyperalgesia in vivo. Conclusions and Implications This study supports a role for tyrosine kinases in PAR 2 -mediated receptor-operated gating of TRPV 4 channels, independent of Gaq stimulation. The ability of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor to diminish PAR 2 -induced activation of TRPV 4 channels and consequent mechanical hyperalgesia identifies <b>bafetinib</b> (which is in development in oncology) as a potential novel analgesic therapy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We propose new {{developments}} of global network scoring methods previously introduced {{to estimate the}} importance of genes in diseases. We apply these methods to drug proteomics profiles, which consist of drug targets, to determine {{the part of the}} human interactome perturbed by a drug. Drug and disease network scores can be combined to obtain novel side-effect and pathway association prediction strategies. We illustrate our methods comparing four kinase inhibitor profiles (dasatinib, bosutinib, imatinib, <b>bafetinib)</b> ranging from very promiscuous to highly specific. We predict and identify the cause of plausible side-effects of bosutinib...|$|E
40|$|Prediction of drug {{action in}} human cells {{is a major}} {{challenge}} in biomedical research. Additionally, there is strong interest in finding new applications for approved drugs and identifying potential side effects. We present a computational strategy to predict mechanisms, risks and potential new domains of drug treatment {{on the basis of}} target profiles acquired through chemical proteomics. Functional protein-protein interaction networks that share one biological function are constructed and their crosstalk with the drug is scored regarding function disruption. We apply this procedure to the target profile of the second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitor <b>bafetinib</b> which is in development for the treatment of imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia. Beside the well known effect on apoptosis, we propose potential treatment of lung cancer and IGF 1 R expressing blast crisis...|$|E
40|$|Leukemic {{cells from}} Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) {{patients}} interact with stromal {{cells of the}} surrounding microenvironment. Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) represent the main population in CLL marrow stroma, which may {{play a key role}} for disease support and progression. In this study we evaluated whether MSCs influence in vitro CLL cell survival. MSCs were isolated from the bone marrow of 46 CLL patients and were characterized by flow cytometry analysis. Following co-culture of MSCs and leukemic B cells, we demonstrated that MSCs were able to improve leukemic B cell viability, this latter being differently dependent from the signals coming from MSCs. In addition, we found that the co-culture of MSCs with leukemic B cells induced an increased production of IL- 8, CCL 4, CCL 11, and CXCL 10 chemokines. As far as drug resistance is concerned, MSCs counteract the cytotoxic effect of Fludarabine/Cyclophosphamide administration in vivo, whereas they do not protect CLL cells from the apoptosis induced by the kinase inhibitors <b>Bafetinib</b> and Ibrutinib. The evidence that leukemic clones are conditioned by environmental stimuli suggest new putative targets for therapy in CLL patients...|$|E
40|$|Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) {{is in part}} {{driven by}} the {{tyrosine}} kinase bcr-abl, but imatinib does not produce long-term remission. Therefore, second-generation ABL inhibitors are currently in clinical investigation. Considering different target specificities and the pronounced genetic heterogeneity of Ph+ ALL, which contributes to the aggressiveness of the disease, drug candidates should be evaluated {{with regard to their}} effects on the entire Ph+ ALL-specific signaling network. Here, we applied an integrated experimental and computational approach that allowed us to estimate the differential impact of the bcr-abl inhibitors nilotinib, dasatinib, Bosutinib and <b>Bafetinib.</b> First, we determined drug-protein interactions in Ph+ ALL cell lines by chemical proteomics. We then mapped those interactions along with known genetic lesions onto public protein-protein interactions. Computation of global scores through correlation of target affinity, network topology, and distance to disease-relevant nodes assigned the highest impact to dasatinib, which was subsequently confirmed by proliferation assays. In future, combination of patient-specific genomic information with detailed drug target knowledge and network-based computational analysis should allow for an accurate and individualized prediction of therapy.
