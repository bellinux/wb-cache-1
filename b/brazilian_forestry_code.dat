The reform of the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Forestry</b> <b>Code</b> in 2011 occupied large spaces both in Congress and the media. Brazilian Deputies approved the proposal on the expansion of deforestation without hearing scientists. This measure impacts the Brazilian goal of emissions of gases that enhance the greenhouse effect. The "Folha de S.

O objetivo geral do estudo foi ampliar o debate em torno da Reserva Florestal Legal e da sua compensação, por meio da análise de alguns conceitos considerados importantes para a gestão integrada floresta-água na propriedade rural. Tendo ainda como objetivos específicos: analisar as modificações ocorridas no Código Florestal Brasileiro no que diz respeito à Reserva Florestal Legal; identificar as vantagens técnicas ambientais da compensação; caracterizar os proprietários rurais de uma microbacia sobre a disposição em compensar a Reserva Florestal Legal; averiguar a necessidade de implantação de práticas educacionais e de fornecimento de informações legais voltadas ao proprietário rural, de forma a contribuir com a conservação da floresta e da água e colaborar para a regulamentação da compensação da Reserva Florestal Legal entre propriedades. Foi aplicado um questionário aos responsáveis por doze propriedades rurais localizadas no Município de Analândia, sendo 6 das propriedades localizadas na microbacia área de estudo, e seis delas localizadas em áreas adjacentes a esta microbacia, ambas pertencentes à subbacia Alto do Corumbataí. A microbacia de estudo foi escolhida por estar inserida na Bacia do Rio Corumbataí e ser uma área prioritária para a recuperação e a conservação florestal, além de ser uma das áreas próximas às cabeceiras de drenagem. Deve-se ressaltar sua importância na produção de água em quantidade e qualidade. As informações levantadas permitem concluir que o Código Florestal sofreu 67 alterações por meio de Medida Provisória, e, no entanto, ainda não existe regulamentação quanto à recomposição da Reserva Florestal Legal através da compensação. A possibilidade de se recompor a Reserva Florestal Legal por meio da compensação, é um instrumento muito importante para a gestão floresta-água. O desconhecimento da legislação e o desinteresse por parte dos proprietários rurais demonstram a necessidade de implantação de práticas educacionais, bem como a necessidade de se criar incentivos para a manutenção da cobertura florestal nas propriedades rurais. The propose of {{this study}} was to analyze how The Code of Forestry is to be applied, in light of the {{compulsory}} requirement to restructure the Legal Forestry Reserve, one restructuring option being the payment of compensation by the Legal Forestry Reserve in the form of another property located in the same water basin, or at most in the same Hydro Resources Unit. The study had as its general objective the widening of discussion around the topic of the Legal Forestry Reserve and compensation by way of analysis of those ideas deemed essential for successful integrated Forestry/Water management of properties in rural areas. The study has the following specific objectives: analyzing the changes made to the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Forestry</b> <b>Code</b> with regard to what it says about the Legal Forestry Reserve; identifying the technical and environmental advantages of the compensation program; making the owners of rural properties in the water basins aware of the Legal Forestry Reserves willingness to provide compensation; ascertaining the need to institute educational guidelines and a source of legal information that relate to owners of rural property so as to help promote the conservation of forest and water resources and collaboration with regard to regulating compensation paid by the Legal Forestry Reserve amongst the various properties. A questionnaire was submitted to twelve individuals responsible for rural properties located in the Municipality of Analândia. Six of these properties were located in the water basin under study, and six of them located out of this water basin. All the twelve properties belong to the sub-basin of Alto do Corumbataí, sandwiched in the River Corumbataí basin and being deemed a priority area regarding restoration and preservation of forest vegetation; as well as being one of the areas nearest to the drainage headwaters, an area whose importance is destined to revive through the production of good quality water in quantity. The information obtained led us to conclude that despite 67 (sixty-seven) changes made to the Forestry Code by way of a Provisional Ordinance, there is still, nevertheless, no regulatory framework in place governing the restructuring of the Legal Forestry Reserve through a program of compensation. The potential for restructuring the Legal Forestry Reserve through a compensation program is a way in the field of Forestry/Water management. Ignorance of the legislation in force or lack of interest on the part of owners of rural properties testify to the need to introduce a set of educational guidelines and foster incentives that will encourage the preservation of the current level of forest vegetation in properties located in rural areas...|$|E

Although {{the effects of}} forest conversion have been studied {{in a wide range}} of taxonomic groups, the effects on macrofungal communities remain poorly understood. We sampled macrofungal fruiting bodies in the National Forest of São Francisco de Paula in Southern Brazil over 12 months in four different forest habitats: native Araucaria angustifolia forest, A. angustifolia plantation, Pinus taeda or P. elliottii plantation, and Eucalyptus saligna plantation. The distribution of macrofungal species in different functional groups varied among habitats: the macrofungal species composition of the A. angustifolia plantation was more similar to that of the native forest, while the exotic Pinus or Eucalyptus plantations were less similar to the native forest. The conversion of native forest to exotic tree plantations reduced the number of macrofungal decomposer species, probably due to changes in substrate availability and quality.

We investigated the effects of corridor width and degradation status of 37 riparian forest sites (including 24 corridors connected to large source-forest patches, 8 unconnected forest corridors, and 5 control riparian zones embedded within continuous forest patches) on bird and mammal species richness in a hyper-fragmented forest landscape surrounding Alta Floresta, Mato Grosso, Brazil. We used point-count and track-sampling methodology, coupled with an intensive forest-quality assessment that combined satellite imagery and ground truthed data. Vertebrate use of corridors was highly species-specific, but broad trends emerged depending on species life histories and their sensitivity to disturbance. Narrow and/or highly disturbed riparian corridors retained only a depauperate vertebrate assemblage that was typical of deforested habitats, whereas wide, well-preserved corridors retained a nearly complete species assemblage. Restriction of livestock movement along riparian buffers and their exclusion from key areas alongside deforested streams would permit corridor regeneration and facilitate restoration of connectivity...|$|R
