5|$|After the {{nationalisation}} of British Rail in 1948, Marylebone {{was initially}} kept open as a long-distance station. New services were introduced, including the Master Cutler service to Sheffield and the South Yorkshireman to Bradford, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> well-used. From 1949, all local services towards High Wycombe and Princes Risborough were routed into Marylebone, although {{the frequency of}} trains was reduced two years later.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{reliable}} geostationary satellite coverage in 1966, the number of eastern Pacific tropical cyclones was significantly underestimated. It is therefore very possible that there are additional Category5 hurricanes other than those listed, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> reported and therefore not recognized. However, the lack of Pacific Category5 hurricanes during the late 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, is certain.|$|E

5|$|Clark {{wrote his}} memoirs around 1791, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> {{published}} during his lifetime.

5|$|He issued gold, {{silver and}} copper coins, {{although}} his predecessors' coins {{were also used}} to pay government officials and in commerce. Copper coins from Aurangzeb's reign were re-minted with his name.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 September, with only the {{shattered}} remnants its E Company at hand, the U.S. 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, had virtually no troops to defend Yongsan.

Other large reserves were in the Hugoton in Kansas, United States, and nearby gas fields of Kansas and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. New helium plants were scheduled to open in 2012 in Qatar, Russia, and the US state of Wyoming, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> expected to ease the shortage.|$|E
5|$|Commanding {{his forces}} from Pleiku, Major General Phạm Văn Phú, the III Corps commander, was given {{adequate}} warnings {{of the impending}} North Vietnamese attacks, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> given serious consideration. Phú was deceived by an elaborate North Vietnamese communications charade and his belief that PAVN movements toward Buôn Ma Thuột were diversionary operations designed to distract him from the true objective, Pleiku. The defense of Buôn Ma Thuột, therefore, was entrusted to a single Ranger group and provincial Popular and Regional Force units (approximately 4,000 men). They were augmented {{at the beginning of}} March by 53rd Regiment of the 23rd ARVN Division.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} damage, Henderson {{personnel}} {{were able to}} restore one of the runways to operational condition within a few hours.

She started a solo career under the name Doro, in order to avoid legal battles between her record label PolyGram and her former manager.
