25|$|The series {{focuses on}} several social themes such as faith, organ {{donation}} {{and the treatment}} of middle-aged men.

This causes his former allies to feel betrayed, and they ally themselves with Samantha (who now resides in Richtofen's body). Maxis is revealed to have become a sentient artificial intelligence living within the systems of Griffin Station, and he guides his daughter and the three soldiers to launch three missiles at the Earth.

500|$|White Dog is a [...] "blunt, highly {{cinematic}} parable {{about race}} relations" [...] that questions whether racism is a curable mental illness or learned behavior, {{or if it}} is an untreatable disease. The unnamed white German Shepherd is the metaphor of racism, with his radically contrasting moments of innocent, typical dog behavior when not around black persons, and his snarling viciousness when he sees a target. Paul Winfield's character Keys, who <b>believes</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> help the dog unlearn this behavior, represents the view that racism can be unlearned. Keys's attempts to reprogram the dog become a [...] "bold literalization of the race war," [...] and as the film progresses Keys becomes obsessed with the idea that he can cure the dog. Much like Captain Ahab, he declares that if he fails with this dog, he will find another and another until he succeeds. Keys's counterpart, Carruthers, a white trainer, believes the dog is irredeemable and should be killed, representing the view that racism cannot be cured.|$|E
