50|$|Two {{accessories}} {{are commonly}} associated with Canadian milk bags: pitchers and bag openers. The key-shaped <b>bag</b> <b>opener</b> with a clip and a magnet was invented in Toronto in 1979. These bag openers are a common type of refrigerator magnet, although the bags can be opened with scissors or knives.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the expansion, the plant makes two important technical improvements. On the one hand, after a feasibility study, is launching a pilot mobile facility for {{the best use of}} the [...] "fraction rejection." [...] On the other hand, the plant incorporates a new <b>bag</b> <b>opener</b> which increases the capacity and performance {{at the beginning of the}} treatment process.|$|E
50|$|Moving {{floor is}} a hydraulically-driven moving-floor {{conveyance}} system for moving bulk material or palletized product, {{which can be}} used in a warehouse, loading dock or semi-trailer. It automates and facilitates loading and unloading of palletized goods by eliminating the need for a forklift to enter the trailer. In a truck-based application, the system can quickly unload loose material without having to tip the trailer or tilt the floor as with other dumping systems. In a bulk material application such as a waste facility, these systems can reduce double handling by allowing any vehicle to deliver material to the conveying floor and move heavy bulk materials to subsequent stages of a process. For bagged waste, the system can also be combined with <b>bag</b> <b>openers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hebel joined Oberliga Nordrhein side SCB Preußen Köln in {{the summer}} of 2000. He made his debut in a 3-2 defeat to SSVg Velbert on 12 August, coming on as a half time {{substitute}} for Mario Schwarz. Hebel notched his first goal for the club on 10 September, scoring the opener in a 3-2 win over Wegberg-Beeck. He followed up with another goal three games later, <b>bagging</b> the <b>opener</b> in a 2-2 draw with Borussia Mönchengladbach II. Hebel was in good form in late March and early April 2001, scoring three goals in four games. Hebel made 26 appearances and scored five goals during the 2000-01 season, helping the club to a second-place finish behind Bayer Leverkusen II.|$|R
50|$|On 15 August 2014, Jota {{moved to}} England {{and signed a}} three-year deal with Brentford, newly {{promoted}} to Championship, for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut as a 64th-minute substitute for Moses Odubajo in a 2-1 victory over Blackpool at Bloomfield Road on 19 August. He made his first start for the Bees in the following game against Birmingham City, lasting only 17 minutes before being sacrificed for Harlee Dean after Tony Craig received a straight red card. On his seventh appearance, Jota scored his first goal for the club - firing {{the ball into the}} top corner during first half stoppage time - in a 2-0 win over Leeds United at Griffin Park on 27 September. He scored again the following Saturday, converting Alan McCormack's cross to <b>bag</b> the <b>opener</b> in a 3-1 victory over Reading.|$|R
5000|$|Much of {{the land}} that became Diamondhead had been {{purchased}} by Walter Gex, Sr., in 1937 from the Gulf State Paper Company and the Easy <b>Opener</b> <b>Bag</b> Company. Additional land was purchased by Gex, bringing his acquisition to nearly 5000 acre. In the late 1960s, D.E.A.R., Inc., later known as the Diamondhead Corporation, a large corporation interested in resort developments, began operations on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, with Diamondhead as its first project. Coastal Mississippi had been a popular vacation destination for years, particularly with Midwesterners. Its location was ideal as a second home development given the convenient access via Interstate 55. The land on which Diamondhead is located is the highest point of elevation (100 ft above sea level) on the Gulf Coast in Mississippi. Therefore, the project was named [...] "Diamondhead" [...] after Diamond Head, an iconic volcanic cone on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.|$|R
50|$|Glenn {{takes them}} to the next challenge. He asks for 4 of the best swimmers, which are Paul, Chris, Natalie, and Mel. He then {{explains}} that this challenge might decide the entire game, as their survival equipment is in waterproof bags in the raging rapids. The contestants must get the bags out of the rapids to keep the things in them (the list of items in each bag and their release is on a chart at the rapids.) They have 1 minute to memorize the chart to decide the bags they will keep. The first pack has bear mare, a six pack of beer, 2 sleeping bags, and wipes. They missed the wipes and sleeping bags, but got the beer and the bear mare. The second pack has 2 sleeping <b>bags,</b> a tin <b>opener,</b> a bottle of whiskey, and a loo roll. They get everything but the loo roll this time. After two misses, Mel is replaced with Dafydd. The third pack contains the pen knife, keys to the log cabin, dried rations, and 2 more sleeping bags. This bag is critical, as the keys are in it. The pen knife, rations, and the sleeping bags are saved. The keys are lost. In the fourth pack, there is 5 blankets, luxury food, bars of chocolate, and 2 more sleeping bags. The chocolate, blankets, and sleeping bags are saved. The fifth bag has repellant, a tent, a cuddly toy, and 5 more blankets. If they don't get the tent, they sleep outside. For this run, Natalie and Paul switch. Only the blankets are saved. In the final pack is a torch, the prize money, 2 sleeping bags, {{and a bottle of}} whiskey. Only the money is saved. After the challenge, Glenn offers them the keys to the cabin for half of the prize money, telling them they cannot expect to survive if they sleep outside due to bear attacks. Of course, they say yes.|$|R
