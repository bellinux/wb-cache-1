500|$|Åkerman {{attended}} {{many different}} schools, including Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School in St. Catharines, Ontario. She once attended a Catholic school, {{though she was}} raised as a Buddhist. She has recalled some portions of her childhood as [...] "painful", explaining that [...] "I loved my father very much and I only got to see him during the school holidays. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an advantage that they split up when I was very young, so I could get used to it." [...] She visited her father in Falsterbo, Sweden, during school breaks and talked to him regularly over the phone. She cites her parents as [...] "supportive, positive influences" [...] in her life.|$|E
500|$|The {{overtaking}} manoeuvres made by Coulthard on Michael Schumacher {{received much}} media attention after the race. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: [...] "I had a clean run at Michael {{on the outside}} and equally I felt he drove me wide. You could say he had the right to do that because he had the track position, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a deliberate gesture in trying to run someone wide like that and I was very angry." [...] Michael Schumacher later denied any wrongdoing and citied a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix where Coulthard pushed him wide although no objections were made. He also admitted that he did not see Coulthard's hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes with a source from Formula One's governing body noting: [...] "It was hard racing -- they are racing drivers aren't they?" [...] GrandPrix.com said that Coulthard's overtake meant that [...] "He is ready to stand up to Michael and he is not afraid of what will happen if Michael does not lift." ...|$|E

2500|$|Being {{a period}} of that era of the 1950's I think being gay must have been pretty harsh for Graham. I can imagine...everybody knew, nobody cared, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> such {{a time when you}} didn't talk about issues that were personal, and I think that made him much more secretive and reclusive, and I think that was {{probably}} quite a tough thing for him... — Susan Gaye Anderson ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} show ended, Minka Kelly made a post of her {{thoughts}} on Twitter about the cancellation of the show with her fans. [...] "I've {{had a wonderful time}} working with this incredible crew and amazing cast. I've made friends 4 life! A beautiful experience. #CharliesAngels." [...] ABC president Paul Lee stated also after the cancellation of the show, “I don’t think we breathed life into that franchise <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a strong attempt.” ...|$|E
2500|$|This rivality [...] {{was really}} {{building}} {{from the people}} of the newspapers and the fans. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> very good for both of us, because the publicity was so big and it created a very big interest about me and Maria and was very good in the end. But I don't know why they put this kind of rivality , because the voice was very different. She was really something unusual. And I remember that I was very young artist too, and I stayed near the radio every time that I know that there was something on radio by Maria.|$|E

2500|$|D'Antoni {{was named}} Western Conference Coach of the Month after the Lakers went 7–1 in April. They {{finished}} the season 28–12 after dropping to 17–25 in January {{the day of}} their team meeting in Memphis. Their defense also improved to 13th during that span, finishing the season 18th at 103.6 points per 100 possessions. The Lakers expected starting five of Bryant, Nash, Howard, Gasol and World Peace started together just seven times all season and without registering a win. [...] "The Lakers didn't help things by making the coaching change and putting (D'Antoni) in that situation, which {{he was glad to}} take. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a little bit tougher than he thought it would be", Kupchak said.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2015 {{interview}} Leno reiterated {{his stance}} that O'Brien's own performance {{led to his}} ouster from 11:35 and remained mystified by the suggestion {{that he should have}} refused the time slot when it was offered back to him. [...] "Why? Because Conan and I were good friends? No. At that point ... it’s a business decision. I’m sure it could have been handled differently. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a matter of letting things take its course. If Conan’s ratings would have been fine, it wouldn’t have been an issue. It wouldn’t have come up." [...] In 2017, Leno again absolved himself, instead emphasizing that he kept The Tonight Show number one after his return. [...] He addressed the longstanding claim that his contract was the more expensive one to break with equivocation: [...] "I mean, if I'm that smart, how did I lose the show in the first place?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 11 June 2009 ex-communities {{secretary}} Hazel Blears, {{who chose}} to resign from the government just before the English county council and European elections, said that she regretted the timing of her decision. She also stated that her decision to wear a brooch with the words 'rocking the boat' {{on the same day}} as the resignation was a [...] "stupid thing to do". Speaking to the Manchester Evening News she said of the brooch [...] "It was a brooch my husband had given me. I'd had four weeks of intense media pressure, the like of which I have never known, not just on me but on my husband, my dad, my family. At that point I'd had enough. It was a stupid thing to do <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just trying to put a brave face on—not going out cowed on the basis of expenses claims that genuinely are not true." ...|$|E

2500|$|Daley later {{recalled}} {{the significance of}} the Little Brown Jug in the years he played: [...] "We were always told to never lose this game. Winning the Little Brown Jug was very important to us. Fortunately I was able to go 4-0 in Little Brown Jug games while playing for both teams." [...] Daley recalled that it was strange playing against his former Gopher teammates in the 1943 Jug game: [...] "It was strange as I was playing against my teammates and friends, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the idea of winning the Little Brown Jug that motivated me. We beat Minnesota 49-6 and the Jug came to Michigan. It was a wild story." [...] The Michigan victory snapped a nine-game losing streak to the Gophers. [...] In addition to Daley, the 1943 Michigan team also benefited from the arrival of another wartime transfer, Pro Football Hall of Famer Elroy [...] "Crazy Legs" [...] Hirsch from Wisconsin. [...] The press referred to Daley and Hirsch as [...] "a pair of 'lend-lease' satellites." ...|$|E
2500|$|Quicker than thought I {{brought my}} saber down {{with all my}} {{strength}} upon [...] head. He was moving as the blow fell, and I suppose I did not strike him where I intended, for he received a deep saber cut {{in the back of}} the neck. He fell senseless on his side, then rolled over on his back. He had in his hand a short Sharpe's cavalry carbine. I think he had just fired as I reached Colonel Washington, for the Marine who followed me into the aperture made by the ladder received a bullet in the abdomen, from which he died in a few minutes. The shot might have been fired by someone else in the insurgent party, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> from Brown. Instinctively as Brown fell I gave him a saber thrust in the left breast. The sword I carried was a light uniform weapon, and, either not having a point or striking something hard in Brown's accouterments, did not penetrate. The blade bent double.|$|E

6000|$|I {{reflected}} {{a while and}} then offered him two, which he accepted greedily, and insisted on having in his hands at once--"for luck," [...] as he said, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> rather for my misfortune.|$|E
6000|$|... "Her father!" [...] {{cried the}} lady, smiling. [...] "Nay; Maude {{is a good}} daughter, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> this young golden-haired squire of whom I have heard who has made her turn her back upon the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} old man. [...] "She was a dear creetur.--I {{recollect}} you come here one Christmas morning with a young lady--I ask your pardon, Mr. Redlaw, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a sister you was very much attached to?" ...|$|E
