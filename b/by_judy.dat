5|$|Crystal Dynamics is an American {{video game}} {{developer}} that {{was founded in}} 1992 <b>by</b> <b>Judy</b> Lang, Madaline Canepa and Dave Morris. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, Crystal Dynamics was the first licensed developer for Panasonic's original 3DO console, a gaming hardware platform founded by Kleiner Perkins. Their first release, Crash N Burn, was a launch game for the system and was included as a pack-in game with the console. The 3DO's launch during the 1993 Christmas season was a commercial failure, severely damaging Crystal Dynamics' software strategy. In 1994, the company became a publisher for two new gaming platforms, the PlayStation and the Sega Saturn. The studio was acquired by Eidos Interactive, a British video game publisher, in 1998. After Square Enix acquired Eidos in 2009, Crystal Dynamics became a subsidiary of Square Enix.|$|E
