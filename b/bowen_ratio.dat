Evaporation rates were smaller than those found for other wetlands, ranging between 0. 06 - 0. 16 mm h− 1 during the daytime, and the average latent heat flux accounted for only 23 % of net radiation. Daily average evaporation was only 34 % of the Penman potential open water rate, yet the soil was permanently close to saturation. <b>Bowen</b> <b>ratios</b> in the range 3 - 5 indicate that available energy is primarily partitioned into sensible heat by the dense plant canopy. <b>Bowen</b> <b>ratios</b> in this range are normally associated with semi-arid zone climates rather than with a permanently moist raised peat bog. According to the Penman-Monteith model, the conservative evaporation regime at this site {{is due to a}} very large canopy resistance, with daily averages in the range 150 - 608 s m− 1 when the canopy is dry. This large canopy resistance is probably the result of plant responses to a nutrient-poor environment, combined with the effect of an extremely dense canopy preventing the diffusion of water vapour from the moist peat substrate. Variations in canopy resistance behaviour are caused by variable degrees of canopy wetness for several days following rain. This behaviour poses difficulties for modelling evaporation in water balance studies, hence a simple scheme utilising the Penman potential open water evaporation is favoured...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{characterize}} the sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat exchange for different land covers in the heterogeneous steppe landscape of the Xilin River Catchment, Inner Mongolia, China. Eddy-covariance flux measurements at 50 – 100 m above ground were conducted in July 2009 using a weight-shift microlight aircraft. Wavelet decomposition of the turbulence data enables a spatial discretization of 90 m of the flux measurements. For a total of 8446 flux observations during 12 flights, MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in each flux footprint are determined. Boosted regression trees are then used to infer an environmental response function (ERF) between all flux observations (H, LE) and biophysical- (LST, EVI) and meteorological drivers. Numerical tests show that ERF predictions covering the entire Xilin River Catchment (&approx; 3670 km 2 ) are accurate to ≤ 18 %. The predictions are then summarized for each land cover type, providing individual estimates of source strength (36 W m− 2 H − 2 , 46 W m− 2 − 2 ) and spatial variability (11 W m− 2 H − 2 , 14 W m− 2 LE − 2 ) to a precision of ≤ 5 %.

The average differences in net radiation, <b>Bowen</b> <b>ratio,</b> and latent heat flux from different types of instruments can be up to 10, 30, and 20 percent, respectively. The Didcot net radiometer gave higher net radiation while the Swissteco type showed lower values, as compared to the corrected radiation energy balance system (REBS) model. The four-way components method and the Thornthwaite type give similar values to the REBS. The surface energy radiation balance systems type <b>Bowen</b> <b>ratio</b> systems exhibit slightly lower Bowen ratios and thus higher latent heat fluxes, compared to the arid zone evapotranspiration systems. Eddy correlation systems showed slightly lower latent heat flux in comparison to the <b>Bowen</b> <b>ratio</b> systems. It is recommended that users of the flux data take these differences into account...|$|E
40|$|The use of scintillometers to {{determine}} sensible heat fluxes is now common {{in studies of}} land-atmosphere interactions. The main interest in these instruments is due {{to their ability to}} quantify energy distributions at the landscape scale, as they can calculate sensible heat flux values over long distances, in contrast to Eddy Correlation systems. However, scintillometer data do not provide a direct measure of sensible heat flux, but require additional data, such as the <b>Bowen</b> <b>ratio</b> (&beta;), to provide flux values. The <b>Bowen</b> <b>ratio</b> can either be measured using Eddy Correlation systems or derived from the energy balance closure. In this work, specific requirements for estimating energy fluxes using a scintillometer were analyzed, as well as the accuracy of two flux calculation methods. We first focused on the classical method (used in standard software). We analysed the impact of the <b>Bowen</b> <b>ratio</b> according to both time averaging and ratio values; for instance, an averaged <b>Bowen</b> <b>ratio</b> (&beta;) of less than 1 proved to be a significant source of measurement uncertainty. An alternative method, called the "&beta;-closure method", for which the <b>Bowen</b> <b>ratio</b> measurement is not necessary, was also tested. In this case, it was observed that even for low &beta; values, flux uncertainties were reduced and scintillometer data were well correlated with the Eddy Correlation results...|$|E
40|$|The budget {{methods and}} the mixed layer model {{employed}} {{to analyze the}} aircraft data from the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE) are described. Vector budgets for the mixed layer are discussed on conserved variable diagrams. Theoretical solutions are presented for the critical surface <b>Bowen</b> <b>ratio</b> that produces no boundary layer moistening or equivalent potential temperature rise {{as a function of}} the <b>Bowen</b> <b>ratio</b> at the inversion...|$|E
40|$|The {{adjustment}} {{of the trade}} wind atmospheric boundary layer to an abrupt sea surface warming is investigated using a large-eddy simulation (LES) and two simple bulk models: a mixed-layer model (MLM), and a model based on the mixing-line hypothesis (XLM). The near-surface temperature adjusts in a few hours, faster than can be expected from the characteristic time scales associated with the physical processes at play. The near-surface humidity adjusts more slowly, with a time scale of about a day, and it exhibits an initial decrease before increasing to its equilibrium value. An analysis of the MLM suggests that the initial tendency of humidity and temperature results from the difference in <b>Bowen</b> <b>ratios</b> between the equilibrium and the perturbation. An analysis of the three linear modes of the XLM shows that the fastest-decaying mode adjusts the subcloud-layer buoyancy, with a constructive interaction {{of all of the}} physical processes. The second-fastest-decaying mode is an {{adjustment of}} the boundary layer thermodynamical structure and the slowest mode adjusts the boundary layer depth. Approximate analytical expressions of the time scales characterizing these linear modes are derived both for the MLM and the XLM. The MLM exhibits no scale separation between the fastest and second-fastest time scales and a scale separation between these and the slowest time scale only {{in the case of a}} shallow well-mixed boundary layer. The XLM exhibits a scale separation between the buoyancy adjustment of the subcloud layer and the overall thermodynamic adjustment, while conserving the scale separation with the slower adjustment of the boundary layer depth...|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} net atmospheric {{exchanges of}} energy and water vapor using eddy covariance along a chronosequence of Pinus elliottii plantations in north Florida: a recent clear-cut, a mid-rotation stand, and a 24 -year-old, rotation-aged stand. Reflected energy averaged 0. 26 of incoming solar radiation at the clear-cut and 0. 18 at the closed-canopy stands. The sum of sensible (S), latent (LE) and soil heat fluxes accounted for 89 and 85 % of net radiation (Rnet) at the clear-cut and mid-rotation age sites. Both S and LE were linearly related to Rnet at all sites. Seasonal differences occurred {{in the proportion of}} Rnet attributable to S and LE. S was a much smaller proportion of Rnet when the clear-cut and the mid-rotation age stands were flooded in the summer. LE was a greater proportion of Rnet during the summer/fall at all sites when LAI was greatest. <b>Bowen</b> <b>ratios</b> (S/LE) were 0. 34, 0. 50 and 0. 59 in the summer/fall and 0. 71, 0. 77 and 1. 00 in the winter/spring at the clear-cut, mid-rotation and rotation-aged stands, respectively. Maximum rates of evapotranspiration (ET) in the summer were 0. 6 mm h− 1 at all sites. Mean daily rates averaged 3. 3 mm per day in the summer/fall and 2. 0 mm per day in the winter/spring. Although, changes in LAI and canopy structure were large, annual ET estimates were similar and averaged 959, 951 and 1110 mm per year along the chronosequence. Results suggest that energy partitioning and annual ET in these pine forests are more sensitive to environmental fluctuations than to management activities...|$|R
40|$|Energy and {{latent heat}} fluxes lambdaE were {{measured}} over ombrotrophic bogs in European Russia (Fyodorovskoye) and in central Siberia (Zotino) using the eddy covariance technique, {{as part of}} the EuroSiberian Carbonflux Project. The study covered most of the snowfree periods in 1998, 1999 and 2000; in addition some data were also collected under snow in early spring and late autumn 1999 and 2000. The snowfree period in Europian Russia exceeds the snowfree period in central Siberia by nearly 10 weeks. Marked seasonal and interannual differences in temperatures and precipitation, and hence energy partitioning, were observed at both sites. At both bogs latent heat fluxes (lambdaE) exceeded sensible heat fluxes (H) during most of the snowfree period: maximum lambdaE were between 10 and 12 MJ m(- 2) d(- 1) while maximum H were between 3 and 5 MJ m(- 2) d(- 1). There was a tendency towards higher <b>Bowen</b> <b>ratios</b> at Fyodorovskoye. Net radiation was the most influential variable that regulated daily evaporation rates, with no obvious effects due to surface dryness during years with exceptionally dry summers. Total snowfree evaporation at Fyodorovskoye (320 mm) exceeded totals at Zotino (280 mm) by 15 %. At the former site, evaporation was equal to or less than precipitation, contrasting the Zotino observations, where summer evaporation was distinctly higher than precipitation. During the entire observation period evaporation rates were less than 50 % of their potential rate. These data suggest a strong 'mulching' effect of a rapidly drying peat surface on total evaporation, despite the substantial area of free water surfaces during parts of the year. This effect of surface dryness was also observed as close atmospheric coupling...|$|R
