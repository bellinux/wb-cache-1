Cox was fired after the 1981 season and replaced with Joe Torre, under whose leadership the Braves attained their first divisional title since 1969. Strong performances from Bob Horner, Chris Chambliss, pitcher Phil Niekro, and short relief pitcher Gene Garber helped the Braves, but no Brave was more acclaimed than Murphy, who won both a Most Valuable Player and a Gold Glove award. Murphy also won an MVP award the following season, but the Braves began a period of decline that defined the team throughout the 1980s. Murphy, excelling in defense, hitting, and running, was consistently {{recognized as one of the}} league's best players, but the Braves averaged only 65 wins per season between 1985 and 1990. Their lowest point came in 1988, when they lost 106 games. The 1986 season saw the return of <b>Bobby</b> <b>Cox</b> as general manager.

25|$|After {{nineteen}} {{seasons with}} the Atlanta Braves, third baseman Chipper Jones announced on March 22, 2012 that he would retire {{following the end of}} the season. Jones held a news conference the same day at Champion Stadium, the Spring training home of the team. The entire Braves team and former manager <b>Bobby</b> <b>Cox</b> were in attendance for the official announcement. Having spent the first eighteen seasons of his career with the Braves, Chipper leads all active players in years of service with one club. His first year with the team, the 1995 season, was the year the Braves won their first World Championship in Atlanta. Chipper remains as the last active player from that Championship team. After sitting out the first four games of the season due to a knee injury, Jones hit a home run in his season debut against the Houston Astros on April 10. Five days later, Jones hit a home run in his first game of the season at Turner Field.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 Atlanta Braves Season {{features}} the Braves' attempt to reclaim a postseason berth {{for the first}} time since 2005. The Braves were once again skippered by <b>Bobby</b> <b>Cox,</b> now in his 25th and final season managing the team. The Braves started the 2010 season slowly and had a nine-game losing streak in April. Then they had a nine-game winning streak from May 26 through June 3, the Braves longest since 2000 when they won 16 in a row. On May 31, the Atlanta Braves defeated the then-first place Philadelphia Phillies at Turner Field to take sole possession of first place in the National League East standings, a position they had maintained through the middle of August. The last time the Atlanta Braves led the NL East on August 1 was in 2005. On July 13, 2010 at the 2010 MLB All-Star Game in Anaheim, Braves catcher Brian McCann was awarded the All-Star Game MVP Award for his clutch two-out, three-run double in the seventh inning to give the National League its first win in the All-Star Game since 1996. He became the first Brave to win the All-Star Game MVP Award since Fred McGriff did so in 1994. The Braves made two deals before the trade deadline to acquire Álex González, Rick Ankiel and Kyle Farnsworth from the Toronto Blue Jays and Kansas City Royals, giving up shortstop Yunel Escobar, pitchers Jo-Jo Reyes and Jesse Chavez, outfielder Gregor Blanco and three minor leaguers. On August 18, 2010 they traded three pitching prospects for first baseman Derrek Lee from the Chicago Cubs. On August 22, 2010 against the Chicago Cubs, Mike Minor struck out 12 batters across 6 innings; an Atlanta Braves single game rookie strikeout record. The Braves dropped to second in the NL East in early September, but won the NL Wild Card. They lost to the San Francisco Giants in the National League Division Series in four games. Every game of the series was determined by one run. After the series-clinching victory for the Giants in Game 4, <b>Bobby</b> <b>Cox</b> was given a standing ovation by the fans, also by players and coaches of both the Braves and Giants.|$|E
