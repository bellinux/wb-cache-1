5|$|Measure 91 was {{approved}} in 2014, legalizing non-medical cultivation and uses of marijuana. It followed perennial, unsuccessful efforts to legalize marijuana by <b>ballot</b> <b>initiative,</b> including in 1986 and in 2012 {{which made it}} to the ballot, but voters rejected.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Gravel {{authored}} {{and secured}} the passage into {{law of the}} General Stock Ownership Corporation, that became Subchapter U of the Tax Code under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

5|$|In 2009 voters {{approved}} a <b>ballot</b> <b>initiative</b> allowing {{the construction of}} four new casinos in the state. Thirty months later Horseshoe Casino Cleveland, developed by Rock Gaming LLC and Caesars Entertainment Corporation, became Ohio’s first casino, when it opened on May 14, 2012. Hollywood Toledo, developed and operated by Penn National Gaming, opened 2 weeks later on May 29 followed by Hollywood Columbus, which opened on October 8, 2012. Horseshoe Cincinnati {{is expected to be}} the state’s fourth and final full-service casino when it opens on March 4, 2013.|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} <b>ballot</b> <b>initiatives</b> {{at the state level}} to determine whether the presence of certain types of <b>ballot</b> <b>initiatives</b> cause an increase in voter turnout at the state level. This study is unique in that rather than focusing on individual level voting behavior to explain why an individual {{may or may not be}} more likely to vote with the inclusion of <b>ballot</b> <b>initiatives,</b> I focus on aggregate level data to answer the following questions: do certain types of <b>ballot</b> <b>initiatives</b> have an effect on voter turnout? If so, how large is the effect? Collecting data from all <b>ballot</b> <b>initiatives</b> that appeared in the United States from 1998 - 2014, my research disputes the conventional wisdom that <b>ballot</b> <b>initiatives</b> have any effect on voter turnout during a presidential election. However, my research shows a four percent increase in turnout when any initiative appears on the ballot and a nearly five percent increase in voter turnout when an initiative concerning same-sex marriage appeared on the ballot during a non-presidential year election...|$|R

5|$|On 9 February 2014, Swiss voters {{narrowly}} {{approved by}} 50.3% a <b>ballot</b> <b>initiative</b> {{launched by the}} national conservative Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC) to restrict immigration, and thus reintroducing a quota system on the influx of foreigners. This initiative was mostly backed by rural (57.6% approvals) and suburban agglomerations (51.2% approvals), and isolated towns (51.3% approvals) of Switzerland {{as well as by}} a strong majority (69.2% approval) in the canton of Ticino, while metropolitan centres (58.5% rejection) and the French-speaking part (58.5% rejection) of Switzerland rather rejected it. Some news commentators claim that this proposal de facto contradicts the bilateral agreements on the free movement of persons from these respective countries.|$|E
5|$|Progressive {{politics}} {{have been particularly}} strong in municipal government since the 1960s. Voters approved charter amendments that have lessened the penalties for possession of marijuana (1974), and that aim to protect access to abortion in the city should it ever become illegal in the State of Michigan (1990). In 1974, Kathy Kozachenko's victory in an Ann Arbor city-council race made her the country's first openly homosexual candidate to win public office. In 1975, Ann Arbor became the first U.S. city to use instant-runoff voting for a mayoral race. Adopted through a <b>ballot</b> <b>initiative</b> sponsored by the local Human Rights Party, which feared a splintering of the liberal vote, the process was repealed in 1976 after use in only one election. As of May 2016, Democrats hold the mayorship and nine out of the ten council seats. Nationally, Ann Arbor is located in Michigan's 12th congressional district, represented by Democrat Debbie Dingell.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of his governorship, Romney opposed same-sex marriage and civil unions, but advocated tolerance and supported some domestic partnership benefits. A November 2003 Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision required the state to recognize same-sex marriages (Goodridge v. Department of Public Health). Romney reluctantly backed a state constitutional amendment in February 2004 that would have banned those marriages but still allowed civil unions, viewing it as the only feasible way to accomplish the former. In May 2004, in compliance with the court decision, the governor instructed town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. However, citing a 1913 law that barred out-of-state residents from getting married in Massachusetts if their union would be illegal in their home state, he said no marriage licenses were to be issued to those people not planning to move to Massachusetts. In June 2005, Romney abandoned his support for the compromise amendment, stating that it confused voters who opposed both same-sex marriage and civil unions. Instead, he endorsed a <b>ballot</b> <b>initiative</b> led by the Coalition for Marriage and Family (an alliance of socially conservative organizations) that would have banned same-sex marriage and made no provisions for civil unions. In 2004 and 2006, he urged the U.S. Senate to vote in favor of the Federal Marriage Amendment.|$|E
