6000|$|The Ork sat {{upon its}} {{haunches}} {{much as a}} cat does, but used the finger-like claws of its front legs almost as cleverly {{as if they were}} hands. Perhaps the most curious thing about the creature was its tail, or what ought to have been its tail. This queer arrangement of skin, bones and muscle was shaped like the propellers used on boats and airships, having fan-like surfaces and <b>being</b> <b>pivoted</b> <b>to</b> its body. Cap'n Bill knew something of mechanics, and observing the propeller-like tail of the Ork he said: ...|$|E
5000|$|Designed by Brian Jones and Bernard Hooper Engineering, the Bonneville T140AV, {{initially}} {{for police}} use featured an anti-vibration system, the swing arm <b>being</b> <b>pivoted</b> and attached <b>to</b> the engine, which was itself isolated on rubber mounts from the chassis [...] Engine balance was also revised. Also produced in 'Executive', TSS {{as well as}} TR7V Tiger forms, the T140AV was built between 1981 and 1983.|$|R
50|$|Horizontal rows of multipaned {{windows are}} {{subsidiary}} in overall effect to the vertical lines of quoined piers which separate the window columns. These piers are decoratively composed of cream coloured bricks alternating at every fourth row {{with a band}} of darker hue. Contrasting bricks are also patterned throughout the window columns. The twelve-paned sash windows have shallow arched heads, the top row featuring a brick keystone. They are unusual in <b>being</b> designed <b>to</b> <b>pivot</b> for maximum light and ventilation. An elaborate moulded cornice is surmounted by a simple but dominant rendered-brick parapet displaying the company name in bold lettering and hiding the sawtooth roof behind. A straight corrugated iron awning suspended by iron rods over the railway siding and loading bays emphasises {{the base of the}} Vernon Terrace facade.|$|R

The parallel pivoting technique uses the compatibility relation between <b>pivots</b> <b>to</b> identify parallel <b>pivot</b> candidates and uses the Markowitz number of <b>pivots</b> <b>to</b> minimize fill-in.

40|$|The United States’ <b>pivot</b> <b>to</b> Asia is spurring a {{new round}} of {{military}} competition in the Asia‑Pacific region. This paper argues that this is doing more harm than good to the long‑term relationship between the United States and Asian nations, particularly between the United States and China. Money could be saved from the military efforts to focus on a civic <b>pivot</b> <b>to</b> build stronger intercultural bonds between the United States and Asia. Proposed measures include the creation of more rigorous educational programs on Asian languages and civilizations for Americans to cultivate a deeper understanding of and identification with Asian civilizations. 美国将轴心定位于亚洲，刺激了亚太地区展开新一轮的军事竞赛。本文认为，这种做法对于美国和亚洲国家的长期关系，尤其是美中之间的长期关系弊大于利。从减少军事行动节约出的资金可以投入民事方面，用以建立美国与亚洲之间更加牢固的跨文化纽带。推荐的措施包括，推出更为严格的亚洲语言和文化教育项目，来帮助美国人更好的了解亚洲文明、认同亚洲文明...|$|R
