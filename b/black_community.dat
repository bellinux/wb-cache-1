5|$|Despite Governor Catts' {{change of}} attitude, white mob action {{frequently}} occurred in towns throughout north and central Florida and went unchecked by local law enforcement. Extrajudicial violence against black residents was so common that it seldom {{was covered by}} newspapers. In 1920, whites removed four black men from jail, who were suspects accused of raping a white woman in Macclenny, and lynched them. In Ocoee the same year, two black citizens armed themselves {{to go to the}} polls during an election. A confrontation ensued and two white election officials were shot, after which a white mob destroyed Ocoee's <b>black</b> <b>community,</b> causing as many as 30 deaths, and destroying 25 homes, two churches, and a Masonic Lodge. Just weeks before the Rosewood massacre, the Perry Race Riot occurred on 14 and 15 December 1922, in which whites burned Charles Wright at the stake and attacked the <b>black</b> <b>community</b> of Perry, Florida after a white schoolteacher was murdered. On the day following Wright's lynching, whites shot and hanged two more black men in Perry; next they burned the town's black school, Masonic lodge, church, amusement hall, and several families' homes.|$|E

5|$|One night, {{a pair of}} LAPD {{officers}} come in {{to speak}} to Sweetback's boss, Beetle (Simon Chuckster). A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the <b>black</b> <b>community</b> {{to bring in a}} suspect. The police ask permission to arrest Sweetback, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence, in order to appease the <b>black</b> <b>community.</b> Beetle agrees, and the officers arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers arrest a young Black Panther named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, and beat him. In response, Sweetback uses the handcuffs, still hanging from his wrist, to beat the officers into unconsciousness.|$|E

The results show that, in spite of the supposed advantages of the northern 2 ̆ 2 Black Metropolis, 2 ̆ 2 <b>Black</b> <b>communities</b> in the urban North were relatively limited in their potential to offer opportunities for Black women to enter pursuits that were, at the time, mainstays of a nascent class of Black professional women...|$|R
5000|$|World War I saw further {{growth in}} the size of London's <b>Black</b> <b>communities</b> with the arrival of {{merchant}} seamen and soldiers. At that time, there were also small groups of students from Africa and the Caribbean migrating into London. These communities are now among the oldest <b>black</b> <b>communities</b> of London [...] At that time, the largest <b>Black</b> <b>communities</b> were {{to be found in the}} United Kingdom's great port cities: London's East End, Liverpool, Bristol and Cardiff's Tiger Bay, with other communities in South Shields in Tyne & Wear and Glasgow. It is estimated in 1914 the black population was around 10,000 and centered largely in London, about 70% being men.|$|R
5|$|Race {{relations}} were tense during the Reconstruction era, as whites resisted freedmen {{being allowed to}} choose their labor, vote, and have freedom of movement.

50|$|In other regions, such as San Andrés y Providencia, or the Magdalena valley, <b>black</b> <b>communities</b> had {{considerable}} white and/or Amerindian admixture.

Religion in the <b>black</b> <b>communities</b> remains the most durable link with the African past. Wholly <b>black</b> <b>communities</b> have been disappearing, not only because their residents have been moving to the cities {{but also because the}} surrounding mestizo and white populations have been moving into <b>black</b> <b>communities.</b> Eventual absorption into the mixed milieu appears inevitable. Moreover, as blacks have moved into the mainstream of society from its peripheries, they have perceived the advantages of better education and jobs. Rather than forming organizations to promote their advancement as a group, blacks have for the most part concentrated on achieving mobility through individual effort and adaptation to the prevailing system.|$|R

40|$|The current study, {{conducted}} by CHAD {{and funded by}} the National Park Service through the URCD, initially began with two straight-forward research objectives: 1) to uncover the role of free <b>black</b> <b>communities</b> in the Underground Railroad in Delaware, and 2) to identify the use of water routes to escape from or through the state. As the project evolved, several more goals were added, reflecting {{some of the issues}} and complications encountered during the research. These objectives focused primarily on the research methodologies developed in conjunction with the initial goals: 3) to create a methodology for the study of free <b>black</b> <b>communities</b> in Delaware; 4) to develop a strategy for mapping the known data about free <b>black</b> <b>communities</b> and UGRR routes through Delaware; and 5) to identify a list of further research needs. This report is broken into several sections that reflect these objectives. First, the introduction includes a detailed explanation of the methodology developed to study free <b>black</b> <b>communities,</b> as well as identification of some of the common problems with the process and the biasesof the records available. Second, the section on free <b>black</b> <b>communities</b> provides both an overview for the patterns seen across the state and a series of case studies that explore the particular circumstances of five different communities. Each of the case studies addresses the particular issues related to the methodology and sources for that location. The results of the mapping research are incorporated into the overview discussion of free <b>black</b> <b>communities</b> and into a separate section discussing potential routes for freedom-seekers. A final section addresses areas of future research needs...|$|R
5|$|The {{end of the}} war brought {{national}} attention to Oak Ridge, and there was bad publicity about the conditions that the Black residents were living in.
