On November 27, 1978, Milk and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated by Dan White, another city supervisor, who had recently resigned to pursue a private business enterprise <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> sought to get his position back after that endeavor failed. White was sentenced to seven {{years in prison for}} manslaughter, later reduced to five years, and after his release in 1983, committed suicide two years later by carbon monoxide inhalation.|$|E
5|$|Carrie Prejean started {{volunteering}} {{with the}} San Diego chapter of JC's Girls in 2008 and became Miss California USA the following year. At the Miss USA 2009 competition, Prejean became {{the subject of}} a controversy because of her response to a question about same-sex marriage. Scher said that the controversy would not affect Prejean's involvement with the organization and that the issue of same-sex marriage was not relevant to the group's activities. Prejean said that in volunteering with JC's Girls, she encountered pornographic models who, through exploitation and abuse, had developed very low self-esteem <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> regained a sense of their own dignity because of their interaction with JC's Girls volunteers.|$|E
5|$|During the quarterfinal {{match against}} England on September 22, the U.S. won 3–0. All three goals were scored within 12 minutes. The U.S. faced Brazil in the {{semifinal}} {{in what would}} become a controversial and game-changing match for the team. Coach Greg Ryan decided to bench starting goalkeeper, Hope Solo, and instead started Brianna Scurry, a veteran goalkeeper who had started in three World Cups and two Olympics, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> started very few matches since the 2004 Olympics. The U.S. was defeated 4–0 by Brazil. The loss relegated them to a final match against Norway, which they won 4–1, to secure third place standing at the tournament.

5|$|The U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment {{gives an}} {{individual}} suspected of crime a {{right not to}} be forced, by police or other government officials, into giving up evidence that would show {{he or she was}} guilty of a crime. Based on this constitutional prohibition against self-incrimination and to prevent coerced testimony by police or other government officials, the Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona that an individual who was being held by police and was not free to leave had to be told of his/her right to remain silent. After Berghuis, a subsequent case, Salinas v. Texas, considered a suspect who was not being held against his will by police officers, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> instead agreed to accompany officers and discuss a case upon their request. It extended Berghuis by ruling that in such a situation and prior to any arrest, the individual was not required to be explicitly told about his/her right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|On February 3, 2014, Harris {{was named}} to the Futures All-Star roster for the 2014 NBA D-League All-Star Game. At the time of the announcement, Harris was one of at five players on an NBA roster that were selected, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> played over half of their D-League team's games through January 26. On February 4, the eve of the end of Harris' second 10-day contract, the Lakers {{appeared}} to be returning to good health, with the return of Nash, Blake and Farmar to the lineup imminent. That night, although Nash and Blake returned to the starting lineup against Minnesota, Jodie Meeks and Jordan Hill were injured in the first quarter and Harris contributed 19 points and 8 rebounds even though he had been told before the game he would not be re-signed. On February 7, 2014, he was re-acquired by the D-Fenders. On February 8, 2014, Harris again set a new D-Fenders franchise scoring record, this time with 56 points, while adding 15 rebounds against the Santa Cruz Warriors. It was two points shy of the league record set by Jackson four days earlier. He was a nominee for D-League Player of the Week, but Jackson won. Harris played 12 minutes in the February 15 D-League All-Star game. Afterwards, he missed some games due to an ankle injury. He was a finalist for player of the week on March 3 and 10. After playing a total of 22 games in the NBA D-League for the D-Fenders and averaging 31.6 points, 7.9 rebounds and 3.7 assists, Harris signed with Türk Telekom B.K. of the Turkish Basketball League on March 13.|$|E

25|$|One {{absentee}} {{from the}} tapestries is King Charles IX of France, {{who was on}} the throne {{at the time of the}} events depicted, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> died (1574) by the time the hangings were woven. Yates speculates that the Protestant creators of the tapestries deliberately cut him out because of his involvement in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572, in which thousands of French Protestants, or Huguenots, were slaughtered on his orders. Antoine Caron's original drawings for the tapestries, of which six survive, show Charles taking part in the festivities. It is the later artist who removes Charles from the designs and adds the figures in the foreground who relate to the court of Charles's successor Henry III.|$|E
25|$|Makart {{was the son}} of a chamberlain at the Mirabell Palace, born in {{the former}} {{residence}} of the prince-archbishops of Salzburg. Initially, he received his training in painting at the Vienna Academy between 1850 and 1851 from Johann Fischbach. While in the Academy, German art was under the rule of a classicism, which was entirely intellectual and academic—clear and precise drawing, sculpturesque modelling, and pictorial erudition were esteemed above all. Makart, who was a poor draughtsman, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> a passionate and sensual love of color, was impatient to escape the routine of art school drawing. For his fortune, he was found by his instructors to be devoid of all talent and forced to leave the Vienna Academy.|$|E

It stopped at the Jimenez Station in Aguadilla for a routine engineer and boilerman exchange with Train No. 4 which was heading towards San Juan. The engineer assigned to Train No. 3's ride from Jimenez Station to Ponce was Jose Antonio Roman, an experienced freight train engineer, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> never worked in passenger travel.
