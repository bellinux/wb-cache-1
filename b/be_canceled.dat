The retirement of the Hawker Hunters in 1994ended its ground support capability, and a cut of one-third from the defence budget meant that plans for a second purchase of F/A-18s and supporting air-to-ground weapons (the reason the multi-capable Hornet was selected) had to <b>be</b> <b>canceled,</b> leaving both it and the F-5s in a strictly air-to-air role.|$|E
