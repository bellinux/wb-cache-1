25|$|The {{most heavily}} studied betalain is <b>betanin,</b> also called {{beetroot}} red {{after the fact}} that it may be extracted from red beet roots. <b>Betanin</b> is a glucoside, and hydrolyzes into the sugar glucose and betanidin. It is used as a food coloring agent, and the color is sensitive to pH. Other betalains known to occur in beets are isobetanin, probetanin, and neobetanin. The color and antioxidant capacity of <b>betanin</b> and indicaxanthin (betaxanthin derived of L-proline) are affected by dielectric microwave heating. Addition of TFE (2,2,2-trifluoroethanol) is reported to improve the hydrolytic stability of some betalains in aqueous solution. Furthermore, a betanin-europium(III) complex has been used to detect calcium dipicolinate in bacterial spores, including Bacillus anthracis and B. cereus.|$|E

25|$|When {{beet juice}} is used, {{it is most}} stable in foods with a low water content, such as frozen {{novelties}} and fruit fillings. <b>Betanins,</b> obtained from the roots, are used industrially as red food colourants, e.g. to intensify the colour of tomato paste, sauces, desserts, jams and jellies, ice cream, sweets, and breakfast cereals.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} thermal {{processing}} and the pH {{of the cooking}} media were investigated on pigments of beet roots, carrots, fenugreek and tomatoes. The pH had a substantial effect on <b>betanins</b> and chlorophyll and marginal effects on beta carotene and lycopene. Heat treatments affected some of the pigments, bur between methods of heat treatment, i. e., pressure cooking or steam cooking, variations were not generally encountered. Batch-to-batch variations were observed in certain pigments, which {{may be due to}} the level of maturity of the vegetable varieties and production variables. Sensory analysis of samples revealed a large variation in responses of panelists. There was a close correlation between instrumentally measured and visually analyzed color parameters, the largest effect was due to the cooking media treatment...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine if}} the oral consumption of red beetroot food color would result in an inhibition of N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA) -induced tumors in the rat esophagus. Rats were treated with NMBA and given either regular water ad libitum or water containing 78 [*]μg/mL commercial red beetroot dye, E 162. The number of NMBA-induced esophageal papillomas was reduced by 45 % (P[*]<[*]. 001) in animals that received the food color compared to controls. The treatment also resulted in reduced rates of cell proliferation in both precancerous esophageal lesions and in papillomas of NMBA-treated rats, as measured by immunohistochemical staining of Ki- 67 in esophageal tissue specimens. The effects of beetroot food color on angiogenesis (microvessel density by CD 34 immunostaining), inflammation (by CD 45 immunostaining), and apoptosis (by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling staining) in esophageal tissue specimens were also determined. Compared to rats treated with NMBA only, the levels of angiogenesis and inflammation in the beetroot color-consuming animals were reduced, and the apoptotic rate was increased. Thus, the mechanism(s) of chemoprevention by the active constituents of red beetroot color include reducing cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and inflammation and stimulating apoptosis. Importantly, consumption of the dye in the drinking water for a period of 35 weeks did not appear to induce any overt toxicity. Based on the fact that red beetroot color contains <b>betanins,</b> which have strong antioxidant activity, it is postulated that these effects are mediated through inhibition of oxygen radical-induced signal transduction. However, the sum of constituents of E 162 has not been determined, and other components with other mechanisms may also be involved in antagonizing cancer development...|$|R

50|$|The {{color of}} <b>betanin</b> depends on pH; between {{four and five}} it is bright bluish-red, {{becoming}} blue-violet as the pH increases. Once the pH reaches alkaline levels <b>betanin</b> degrades by hydrolysis, resulting in a yellow-brown color.|$|E
50|$|<b>Betanin,</b> or Beetroot Red, {{is a red}} glycosidic food dye {{obtained}} from beets; its aglycone, obtained by hydrolyzing away the glucose molecule, is betanidin. As a food additive, its E number is E162. <b>Betanin</b> degrades when subjected to light, heat, and oxygen; therefore, it is used in frozen products, products with short shelf life, or products sold in dry state. <b>Betanin</b> can survive pasteurization when in products with high sugar content. Its sensitivity to oxygen is highest in products with a high water content and/or containing metal cations (e.g. iron and copper); antioxidants like ascorbic acid and sequestrants can slow this process down, together with suitable packaging. In dry form <b>betanin</b> is stable {{in the presence of}} oxygen.|$|E

50|$|Beeturia {{is passing}} of red or pink urine after eating {{beetroots}} or foods colored with beetroot extract or beetroot pigments. The color {{is caused by}} the excretion of betalain (betacyanin) pigments such as <b>betanin.</b> The coloring is highly variable between individuals and between different occasions and can vary in intensity from invisible to strong. The pigment is sensitive to oxidative degradation under strongly acidic conditions. Therefore, the urine coloring depends on stomach acidity and dwell time as well as the presence of protecting substances such as oxalic acid. Beeturia is often associated with red or pink feces.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010-11 season, Sorrento were top of the table Serie C1 by November, and faced a strong {{possibility}} of promotion to Serie B. This was largely due to the goals scored by Paulinho <b>Betanin</b> who had weighed in with 24 league goals (in 29 games) {{by the end of the}} season. Promotion was not forthcoming, however, and by finishing the season in second place Sorrento qualified for the Play-offs. <b>Betanin</b> was injured for the final games of the season and did not feature in the play-offs. For the Semi-final they drew Hellas Verona and were unlucky to lose the first leg 2-0 away at the Bentegodi. [...] The second leg saw a 1-1 draw at Stadio Italia and by losing 3-1 on aggregate Sorrento did not qualify for the Play-off final. While Sorrento had not played well enough over the two legs to reach the final, the second leg was marred by controversy. According to a local newspaper the visiting fans of Hellas Verona (a team strongly associated with hooliganism in Italy) disrespected the minute's silence for fallen Italian soldiers in Afghanistan and proceeded to shout racist chants at Sorrento's Senegalese Player Niang. [...] Then following the game, as recounted in the local newspaper Positano news, many local shops were apparently the scene of violence as the Verona fans rampaged the streets. [...] Sorrento failed in their bid for promotion to serie B.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to transform sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L. var. altissima) cells using Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a wild octopine strain B 6 S 3, and to study metabolic changes associated with the transformation. From the primary tumours on leaf fragments, two tumour lines were established: one pale green and the other red-violet in colour. The red-violet pigment was identified by means of high-performance liquid chromatography as <b>betanin.</b> <b>Betanin</b> production is strongly light-dependent. To enhance the <b>betanin</b> yield, nutrient media with different carbohydrates like sucrose, a combination of glucose and fructose, or only glucose or only fructose were tested. The selection of carbohydrate affected <b>betanin</b> production and yield. It was observed that the production of <b>betanin</b> per g of dry mass was 20 – 40 % higher on simple carbohydrates, especially fructose, than on sucrose or the combination of glucose and fructose. However, due to higher biomass production on the medium with sucrose, the highest total yield of <b>betanin</b> was obtained {{in the presence of}} sucrose. The most suitable time for possible <b>betanin</b> extraction was between days 7 and 14 for tissue grown on sucrose. The tumour line seems to be promising as an alternative source of <b>betanin</b> as well as a model to study sugar-regulated genes involved in tissue morphology control...|$|E
