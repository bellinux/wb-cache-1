40|$|This paper models {{commodity}} futures in {{a rational}} expectations equilibrium specifically (i) incorporating {{the conflict of}} interests between Hedgers (Producers-Consumers) and Speculators and (ii) superimposing constraints to immunize the real {{sector of the economy}} from shocks of excessive futures contracting. We extend the framework of Newbery and Stiglitz (1981), Anderson and Danthine (1983) and Britto (1984) to attribute the conflicting and puzzling results in the empirical literature to the presence of multiple equilibria ranked in a pecking order of decreasing pareto-efficiency. Thus, we caution empirical researchers on making inferences on data embedded with moving equilibria, as it can render their analysis of asset pricing mechanism incomprehensible. Finally, we rationalize the imposition of position limits by policy makers to help steer the equilibria to pareto-inferior ones, which make the real sector of the economy more resilient to shocks from the financial sectorContango, Expectations, Normal <b>Backwardations...</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{is argued}} that <b>backwardation</b> is abnormal, and {{suggests}} supply insufficiencies in the corresponding (physical) spot market. However, many commodities markets are frequently in <b>backwardation,</b> especially when the seasonal aspect is taken into consideration, e.g., perishable and/or soft commodities.|$|E
50|$|This {{makes it}} {{possible}} for <b>backwardation</b> to be observable.|$|E
5000|$|The term <b>backwardation,</b> {{when used}} without the {{qualifier}} [...] "normal", can be somewhat ambiguous. Although sometimes {{used as a}} synonym for normal <b>backwardation</b> (where a futures contract price {{is lower than the}} expected spot price at contract maturity), it may also refer to the situation where a futures contract price is merely lower than the current spot price.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the measurement of}} hedging efficiency. It is argued that conventional measures of the efficiency of risk management operations my be unreliable in commodities where the available hedge represents {{the value of the}} commodity for forward, rather than prompt, delivery. Considerable biases can arise when the time structure of prices is not considered, which tend to lead to overstatement of the efficiency of the hedging vehicle. As an alternative we propose the use of simulations of hedges. The use of simulations not only produces very different results to standard financial formulae, but also demonstrates the sensitivity of the effectiveness of hedging to the time structure of prices. This produces some direct inferences for optimal hedging behaviour. Our simulations consider how effective crude oil futures are for the hedging of various streams of tradeable crude oil. The futures contracts, used alone in a hedging strategy, are shown to perform unpredictably in the hedging of dated Brent, which is the direct price index for some 16 million barrels per day of crude oil trade, and whose influence, particularly in the Far East, is still expanding. We contend that the reason for this poor hedging performance is the non-randomness of the basis risk between futures and prompt crude oil. This basis tends to trend, and we consider hedging effectiveness in three regimes, contangos and both narrowing and widening <b>backwardations.</b> We find that the hedging effectiveness is highly dependent on the time structure regime. Because of the potential size and volatility of the basis, under some conditions using futures as a hedging instrument can produce more risk than unhedged positions. This also has implications for market structure, with the development of informal markets to help hedge the risk that can not be hedged by the use of the futures. The implication of our analysis is that the potential gains are considerable for futures market users who are unable, or unwilling, to access the subsidiary informal markets, should a futures contract whose value more closely proxies that of dated Brent be available...|$|R

50|$|This market situation, where , is {{referred}} to as normal <b>backwardation.</b> Forward/futures prices converge with the spot price at maturity, as {{can be seen from the}} previous relationships by letting T go to 0 (see also basis); then normal <b>backwardation</b> implies that futures prices for a certain maturity are increasing over time. The opposite situation, where , {{is referred}} to as contango. Likewise, contango implies that futures prices for a certain maturity are falling over time.|$|E

This makes actual price on expiry to be lower than futures {{contract price}}. <b>Backwardation</b> very seldom arises in money commodities like gold or silver. In the early 1980s, there was a one-day <b>backwardation</b> in silver while some metal was physically moved from COMEX to CBOT warehouses. Gold has historically been positive with exception for momentary backwardations (hours) since gold futures started trading on the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange in 1972.|$|E
5000|$|The Commission of the European Communities [...] {{described}} <b>backwardation</b> and contango {{in relation}} to futures prices: [...] "The futures price may be either higher or lower than the spot price. When the spot price {{is higher than the}} futures price, the market is said to be in <b>backwardation.</b> It is often called 'normal backwardation' as the futures buyer is rewarded for risk he takes off the producer. If the spot price is lower than the futures price, the market is in contango." ...|$|E
5000|$|If the PFC is descending, it is a {{so-called}} <b>backwardation</b> and investors will {{make money by}} exchanging (rolling) their old futures contracts to new ones.|$|E
5000|$|Normal <b>backwardation,</b> also {{sometimes}} called <b>backwardation,</b> is the market condition wherein {{the price of}} a commodities' forward or futures contract is trading below the expected spot price at contract maturity. The resulting futures or forward curve would typically be downward sloping (i.e. [...] "inverted"), since contracts for further dates would typically trade at even lower prices. In practice, the expected future spot price is unknown, and the term [...] "backwardation" [...] may be used to refer to [...] "positive basis", which occurs when the current spot price exceeds the price of the future.|$|E
50|$|Soft {{commodities}} {{have been}} known to adopt a <b>backwardation</b> trend until the late 1990s when futures were actively traded. Speculation and investment requirements later shaped the common contango trend.|$|E

50|$|In {{that era}} on the London Stock Exchange, <b>backwardation</b> was a fee paid by a seller wishing to defer {{delivering}} stock they had sold. This fee was paid {{either to the}} buyer, or to a third party who lent stock to the seller.|$|E
50|$|A <b>backwardation</b> starts {{when the}} {{difference}} between the forward price and the spot price is less than the cost of carry (when the forward price is less than the spot plus carry), or when there can be no delivery arbitrage because the asset is not currently available for purchase.|$|E
5000|$|The {{opposite}} {{market condition}} to contango {{is known as}} <b>backwardation.</b> [...] "A market is 'in backwardation' when the futures price is below the spot price for a particular commodity.

5000|$|In Treatise on Money (1930, chapter 29), {{economist}} John Maynard Keynes {{argued that}} in commodity markets, <b>backwardation</b> is not an abnormal market situation, but rather arises naturally as [...] "normal backwardation" [...] {{from the fact that}} producers of commodities are more prone to hedge their price risk than consumers.

July tomatoes are effectively a different commodity from January tomatoes (contrast contango and <b>backwardation).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Bouchouev {{argued that}} {{traditionally}} {{there was always}} more producer hedging than consumer hedging in oil markets.

Since c. 2008-9, investors are hedging against [...] "inflation, US dollar weakness and possible geopolitical events," [...] instead of investing in {{the front end of the}} oil market.
