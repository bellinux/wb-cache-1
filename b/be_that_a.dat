Episodes last around half an hour, with the self-contained story reaching a conclusion. The stories are linked only {{by the fact that}} each takes place in number 9, <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> mansion, a dressing room or a flat. Every episode stars at least one of Shearsmith or Pemberton, and normally both. Each episode is effectively a short play, and could easily be performed on stage.

40|$|Abstract I aim to {{show that}} {{standard}} theories of counterfactuals are mistaken, not in detail, but in principle, and I aim to say what form a tenable theory must take. Standard theories entail a categorical interpretation of counterfactuals, on which to state <b>that,</b> if it <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>A,</b> it would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> C <b>is</b> to state something, not relative to any supposition or hypothesis, but categorically. On the rival suppositional interpretation, to state <b>that,</b> if it <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>A,</b> it would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> C <b>is</b> to state <b>that</b> it would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> C relative to the supposition <b>that</b> it <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>A.</b> The two interpretations make incompatible predictions concerning the correct evaluation of counterfactuals. I argue that the suppositional interpretation makes the correct prediction...|$|R

25|$|It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{player has}} an {{infinite}} number of possible actions to choose from at a particular decision node. The device used to represent this is an arc joining two edges protruding from the decision node in question. If the action space is a continuum between two numbers, the lower and upper delimiting numbers are placed at the bottom and top of the arc respectively, usually with a variable that is used to express the payoffs. The infinite number of decision nodes that could result are represented by a single node placed in the centre of the arc. A similar device is used to represent action spaces that, whilst not infinite, are large enough to prove impractical to represent with an edge for each action.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to state frustration over the workload in preparing these reports, the HRC in July 2010 proposed a new optional reporting procedure called the ‘List of Issues Prior to Reporting’ (LOIPR). The LOIPR system implements a new procedure whereby the committee sends the state {{a list of}} issues to address and the resulting report satisfies the requirements of Article 40 of the ICCPR. This system remains in the pilot stage until 2015 where the procedure will be reviewed “in terms of its practicality, effectiveness and capacity to improve {{the examination of the}} human rights situation in the State parties”. It is intended LOIPR will allow for time to be used more efficiently and provide focus to the report. A further advantage of the procedure will <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> state will not have to submit both a periodic report and LOIPR report (though initial reports will be required). LOIPR remains an optional report and states may elect to continue with the periodic reports system or may be required by the committee to prepare a full report.|$|E

25|$|The debate {{regarding}} {{the relationship between}} the two plays began in 1725, when Alexander Pope incorporated extracts from A Shrew into The Shrew in his edition of Shakespeare's works. In The Shrew, the Christopher Sly framework is only featured twice; at the opening of the play, and at the end of Act 1, Scene 1. However, in A Shrew, the Sly framework reappears a further five times, including a scene which comes after the final scene of the Petruchio/Katherina story. Pope added most of the Sly framework to The Shrew, even though he acknowledged in his preface that he did not believe Shakespeare had written A Shrew. Subsequent editors followed suit, adding some or all of the Sly framework to their versions of The Shrew; Lewis Theobald (1733), Thomas Hanmer (1744), William Warburton (1747), Samuel Johnson and George Steevens (1765) and Edward Capell (1768). In his 1790 edition of The Plays and Poems of William Shakespeare, however, Edmond Malone removed all A Shrew extracts and returned the text to the 1623 First Folio version. By the end of the eighteenth century, the predominant theory had come to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>A</b> Shrew was a non-Shakespearean source for The Shrew, and hence to include extracts from it was to graft non-authorial material onto the play.|$|E
25|$|Haig {{inspected}} the Loos area (24 June) and expressed {{dissatisfaction with the}} ground; slag heaps and pit head towers which made good observation points for the Germans. French later did the same and agreed. French and Haig {{would have preferred to}} renew the attack at Aubers Ridge. Joffre was not pleased and called another conference (11 July) to urge a British attack on Loos. Haig pushed for Aubers Ridge again (22 July) – French at first agreed until dissuaded by Foch (29 July), who felt that only a British attack at Loos would pull in enough German reserves to allow the French to take Vimy Ridge. French wrote to Joffre saying he was willing to go along with these plans for the sake of Anglo-French cooperation, but then wrote to Joffre again (10 August) suggesting an artillery bombardment with only limited British infantry attacks. This was not what Joffre wanted. Kitchener, who had been invited to tour the French Army (16–19 August) listened sympathetically to Joffre's suggestion that in future Joffre should set the size, dates and objectives of British offensives, although he only agreed for the Loos attack for the moment. Kitchener met with Haig first and then with French. It is unclear exactly why Kitchener and then Haig agreed to go along with Joffre's wishes – possibly the disastrous plight of the Russians, but it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> promise that poison gas could be used may have persuaded Haig. Having got their own way, the French then postponed the attack as they picked new attacking ground in Champagne and arranged for extra shelling at Vimy, in both cases because of the very reasons – German-held villages and other obstructions – to which the British generals had objected.|$|E

500|$|While solitary females each make {{individual}} nests, some species. {{such as the}} European {{mason bee}} Hoplitis anthocopoides, and the Dawson's Burrowing bee, Amegilla dawsoni, are gregarious, preferring to make nests near others of the same species, and giving the appearance of being social. Large groups of solitary bee nests are called aggregations, to distinguish them from colonies. In some species, multiple females share a common nest, but each makes and provisions her own cells independently. This type of group is called [...] "communal" [...] and is not uncommon. The primary advantage appears to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> nest entrance is easier to defend from predators and parasites when there are multiple females using that same entrance on a regular basis.|$|E

500|$|The {{nature of}} Mercian kingship {{is not clear}} from the limited {{surviving}} sources. There are two main theories regarding the ancestry of Mercian kings of this period. One is that descendants of different lines {{of the royal family}} competed for the throne. In the mid-7th century, for example, Penda had placed royal kinsmen in control of conquered provinces. Alternatively, it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> number of kin-groups with local power-bases may have competed for the succession. The sub-kingdoms of the Hwicce, the Tomsæte and the unidentified Gaini are examples of such power-bases. Marriage alliances could also have played a part. Competing magnates, those called in charters [...] "dux" [...] or [...] "princeps" [...] (that is, leaders), may have brought the kings to power. In this model, the Mercian kings are little more than leading noblemen. Offa seems to have attempted to increase the stability of Mercian kingship, both by the elimination of dynastic rivals to his son Ecgfrith, and the reduction in status of his subject kings, sometimes to the rank of ealdorman. He was ultimately unsuccessful, however; Ecgfrith only survived in power for a few months, and 9th century Mercia continued to draw its kings from multiple dynastic lines.|$|E
500|$|One {{contender}} is in {{the civil}} parish of Blacko, {{on the site of}} present-day Malkin Tower Farm; since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building. In The Lancashire Witch-Craze, Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and Gisburn. Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn public house; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign. The primary evidence supporting this location seems to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole. It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the manor of Colne as Mawkin Yarde, described as being [...] "in the north of Colne", but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.|$|E
500|$|The Act is {{relatively}} short, divided into 5 sections, the fifth covering {{the extent of}} the Act and its commencement date. Section 1 covers the test to determine if something is obscene; an article is taken to be obscene if the entire article [...] "is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it". The test is based on [...] "persons"; DPP v Whyte [...] AC 849 established that it was not sufficient for an individual to be depraved or corrupted, it must <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> significant number of people likely to read it would become corrupt. [...] "article" [...] is defined within Section 1 as anything containing material that is read or looked at, any sound recordings and any film or other picture record. A publisher, as used in the Act, is also defined in Section 1; [...] "publisher" [...] is taken to mean anyone who [...] "distributes, circulates, sells, lets on hire, gives, or lends it, or who offers it for sale or for letting on hire", or [...] "in the case of an article containing or embodying matter to be looked at or a record, shows, plays or projects it".

500|$|Loss {{of control}} {{is defined in}} {{sections}} 54 and 55 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. Section 56 abolishes the common law defence of provocation, which also dealt only with murder. There is no mandatory life sentence for voluntary manslaughter. The defence operates whether the defendant is a principal or an accomplice. Broadly speaking, the defendant must have actually lost self-control; the trigger for {{this must be a}} qualifying trigger; and it must <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> [...] "normal" [...] person might also have lost control in the circumstances. The loss of control need not be sudden, but cannot be in a [...] "considered desired for revenge". The loss of control is a subjective test which asks whether this defendant actually lost control, and if so, whether that loss of control led to their killing. The qualifying trigger may take one of two forms, or be a combination of both: that the killing was attributable to the defendant's fear of serious violence from the victim against the defendant or another identified person; or where the defendant's loss of self-control was attributable to a thing or things done or said (or both) which constituted circumstances of an extremely grave character, and caused the defendant to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged. The meaning of the terms [...] "extremely grave character" [...] and [...] "justifiable sense of being seriously wronged" [...] used in the second form is currently unclear. Section 51(1)(c) requires that [...] "a person of 's sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint and in the circumstances of , might have reacted in the same or in a similar way to [...]" [...] These issues are complicated and directing a jury on issues of loss of control is likely to be difficult.|$|E
