5|$|David {{has been}} {{featured}} {{in a number of}} promotional materials for the Alien prequel films. For Prometheus, rather than focusing on the film's connection with the Alien canon, the marketing team emphasized central characters, most prominently David. On March 17, 2012, director Ridley Scott hosted a panel for Prometheus at WonderCon, where attendees were provided with Weyland Corporation <b>business</b> <b>cards</b> that provided a website and telephone number. Upon calling the number, callers were played an automated message that stated that Weyland Corporation's lines were busy, at which point a text message was sent that linked to a video narrated by Fassbender that showed David being unboxed, prior to his awakening. A month later, on April 17, an extended version of the unboxing video was released, with David providing additional insight into his function aboard the Prometheus as the ship's butler and maintenance man, as well as advertising his ability to seamlessly replicate human emotions without the restrictions of ethics or distress. Released with the video was also a poster featuring David, which was printed as a full-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal.|$|E

With the four corner points of the quadrangle, we then estimate the physical aspect ratio of the <b>business</b> <b>card</b> and obtain a homography to rectify the quadrangle back to rectangular shape. We finally enhance the contrast of the rectified <b>business</b> <b>card</b> image using a S-shaped curve. Extensive experiments demonstrated the efficacy and robustness of our system. 1...|$|R
