25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E
500|$|Mark Edward Nero of About.com {{said that}} the song was [...] "sappy" [...] and [...] "cliche", trying to {{replicate}} the success of [...] "Can't Help But Wait", but [...] "doesn't come close." [...] Nero also commented that the song sounded insincere compared with the rawly sexual songs on the album. Ajitpaul Mangat of Tiny Mix Tapes noted the song {{as some of the}} album's generic work, stating, [...] "with its run-of-the-mill lyrics about longing hearts, it sounds like the work of any middling R singer." [...] Tyler Lewis of PopMatters said [...] "I Need A Girl" [...] was among the album's best songs, that it and [...] "Neighbors Know My Name", [...] "thump as they should." [...] David Jeffries of Allmusic noted the song as a standout track from Ready. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday said that on the track, Songz [...] "displays a more flexible delivery than usual." [...] DJBooth said, [...] "Traditional R depends on three things: vocals, writing, and production. [...] In a nutshell, I Need A Girl has the whole trifecta, and should <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> Trey needs to get Ready a solid release date." [...] Reviewing the remix of the song featuring Teyana Taylor and Fabolous, DJBooth said, [...] "Expect the combo of Taylor’s cooed vocals and Trey and Loso’s time-tested musical chemistry to leave listeners more amped than ever before for the release of Songz’ [...] latest LP—after waiting this long, I think it’s safe to say they’re more than Ready." ...|$|E

2500|$|In sum, Magnin's plan of {{the city}} [...] "such {{as it is to}} be" [...] was a synthesizing of {{patterns}} already establishing themselves at the suburban fringes of the city and, in the city proper, an orderly filling in east and west with linear streets out to continuous roads along the waterfronts. The city government hadn't asked for it, but it seemed to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> it wanted.|$|E
2500|$|Equally, if you're {{going to}} ask Andrew Lloyd Webber and Diane Warren to write a song for your X Factor-style talent contest, you're {{probably}} {{going to end up}} with something that sounds like an X Factor winner's song crossed with a show tune. [...] "I've got the will, I've earned the right," [...] croons Ewen before the bombast begins, [...] "to show you it's my time tonight". Overblown, old-fashioned and shamelessly sentimental, this could <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> Eurovision ordered.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, the {{procedure}} {{came to the}} attention of the [...] U. S. public after the publication of Into the Strange Unknown by Ron Ormond and Ormond McGill. The authors called the practice [...] "fourth dimensional surgery," [...] and wrote [...] " [...] still don’t know what to think; but we have motion pictures to show it wasn’t the work of any normal magician, and could very well <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> the Filipinos said it was — a miracle of God performed by a fourth dimensional surgeon." ...|$|E

2500|$|Corsi {{claimed that}} [...] "President Bush is {{pursuing}} a globalist agenda to create a North American Union", a theoretical continental union of Canada, Mexico and the United States, that will supplant the United States. In 2007 he predicted a new unit of currency, called the Amero, which would replace the Dollar for this union within 10 years. The [...] "Union" [...] is a theme in two of his books The Late Great U.S.A.: The Coming Merger With Mexico and Canada (2007) and Minutemen: The Battle to Secure America's Borders (2006) as he explained on The Conservative Caucus's TV show. On December 15, 2006 Corsi reported {{for the first time}} he [...] "had found a major intellectual leader behind the push to integrate North America suggesting that a crisis of 9-11 proportions might <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> was needed to advance the process toward establishing a North American Union and the Amero." ...|$|E
