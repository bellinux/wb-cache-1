50|$|Rimfire is {{a method}} of {{ignition}} for metallic firearm cartridges {{as well as the}} cartridges themselves. It is called rimfire because the firing pin of a gun strikes and crushes the <b>base's</b> <b>rim</b> to ignite the primer. The rim of the rimfire cartridge is essentially an extended and widened percussion cap which contains the priming compound, while the cartridge case itself contains the propellant powder and the projectile (bullet). Once the rim of the cartridge has been struck and the bullet discharged, the cartridge cannot be reloaded, because the head has been deformed by the firing pin impact. While many other different cartridge priming methods have been tried since the 19th century, only rimfire technology and centerfire technology survive today in significant use.|$|R

40|$|The {{versatility}} of cationic cyclopentadienyliron complexes {{is demonstrated}} for {{the generation of}} calix[4]arene-based dendrimers and polymers. Dendrimers were prepared from a branched organoiron calix[4]arene through subsequent reactions of azo dyes and organoiron complexes. The resulting azo dye-containing metallocalix[4]arenes were soluble in polar organic solvents and displayed λ(max) ranging between 430 and 456 [*]nm. Upon addition of various acids, the λ(max) shifted to higher wavelengths (513 - 535 [*]nm). In the solid state and in solution, the azo dye-containing metallocalix[4]arenes reversibly changed colour {{in the presence of}} acid and base, indicating their potential use as acid sensors. Cyclic voltammetric studies showed that the iron centres of the metallocalix[4]arenes were reversibly reduced at E(1 / 2) [*]=[*]- 1. 49 [*]V. When non-branching organoiron-based calix[4]arene were reacted with dithiols, polymers containing calix[4]arenes either in their side chains or main chains were obtained. The polymers possessed weight average molecular weights between 35 000 and 53 000. The polymers were determined to be thermally stable with backbone decomposition occurring above 500 [*]°C.

40|$|The {{collapse}} of the world markets hinted at the significant overestimation of assets on the market. Assets have been mismanaged and severe losses have been incurred. There has since been renewed interest in fundamental valuation models as they are believed to capture a more complete view of firm value. In this paper, we follow up on this renewed interest by empirically analysing the performance and explanatory power of two major present value models, the Discounted Cash Flow model (DCF) and the Residual Income Model (RIM), and in the process, concluding which model works best in the valuation of equity. This paper examines the reliability and accuracy of the DCF and RIM under finite valuation horizons. Empirical tests are performed on 21 large-cap firms from the NASDAQ- 100 index for the period 2000 - 2009. Specified ex-post financial data inputs are extracted from individual firm financials and used in each model accordingly. Prediction errors are calculated using ex-post share prices of the 21 firms on the valuation date as performance benchmarks. Regression analyses are performed to explain cross sectional variation between the models and observed share prices. It is concluded that the accounting <b>based</b> <b>RIM</b> serves as a more reliable and accurate valuation model under most assumptions. The use of accrual accounting data as earnings benchmarks is found to capture value relevant information the DCF inherently ignores, thus producing superior results. Moreover, the RIM enjoys a slight advantage in explanatory power over the DCF...|$|R

50|$|The {{first true}} Lightship Baskets {{were made in}} the mid- to late 1800s aboard the Lightship {{stationed}} on the Nantucket Shoals. The first Lightship Station on the Nantucket Island Shoal was established in June 1854 and crewed by six men. Deployments aboard the Lightship often lasted for 30 days and the crewmembers generally had little to do. The earliest Lightship Baskets begin appearing in the 1860s and are generally of more utilitarian form. The first purse style basket with a lid was made by Lightship Captain Charles Ray (1798-1884), and is relatively similar to the type sold today. Lightship basket <b>bases,</b> <b>rims,</b> and staves tended to be made on-island, with lightship crewmembers bringing these items on board the ship to do the actual weaving, and help pass the time. The moulds were originally made from old cut-up ships' masts. According to the Nantucket Lightship Basket Museum, some of these early Lightship Basket makers included: “Captain Davis Hall, Captain Andrew Sandsbury, Roland Folger, Thomas W. Barrallay, William D. Appleton, George W. Ray, Charles F. Ray, Joe Fisher, Charlie Sylvia, SB Raymond and Isaac Hamblin.” Lightship Baskets stopped being made on board the Nantucket lightships in 1900, when the government stopped allowing crewmembers to spend time doing so. The process continued on Nantucket Island. José Formoso Reyes began making the first true lightship basket purses in the 1940s, calling them “Friendship Baskets” after learning the craft from Captain Charles Ray’s grandson Mitchel Ray. Charlie Sayles, Sr. is credited with creating the original Ivory Whale adornment for a basket top in the 1940s, a practice that is ubiquitous today.|$|R

40|$|In this research, {{experimental}} and numerical methods {{were used to}} analyse the performance of multi-piece wheel structures and two proposed innovative designs to enhance safety were validated by computer simulations. Fatality report analyses revealed that the majority (90 %) of the multi-piece wheel failures were caused by use of lock rings. Experimental tire and <b>rim</b> <b>base</b> tests were conducted to understand the deflection characteristics of off-the-road tires and to validate the finite element model of a five-piece wheel/tire (sized 29. 5 - 29) assembly. A linear relationship {{was found between the}} vertical displacement of the wheel and the maximum lateral deflection of the tire for both static and quasi static loading tests. A robust tire model was validated with an average accumulative error of 9. 7 % and an average validation metric of 0. 96 for tire deflections, compared to the experimental tests. The <b>rim</b> <b>base</b> model was validated with an average error of 7. 6 % and an average validation metric of 0. 93 for wheel deformations, and an average accumulative error of 12. 7 % and an average validation metric of 0. 88 for strains, compared to experimental tests. Based on validated FE model of the five-piece wheel/tire assembly, geometry degradation (material wear out at critical regions) and material degradation (fatigue and corrosion) were studied to estimate their effects on fatigue lives. Two design innovations were proposed to enhance safety and fatigue life of the five-piece wheel. The threaded-connection design reduced the possibility of failure due to the mismatched wheel components. The BS band pull-out simulation revealed that the threaded-connection design was twice as strong as the conventional five-piece design in holding wheel components and the tire together, and the wheel may fail in a safer mode. The fatigue lives of the <b>rim</b> <b>base</b> were two orders of magnitude higher than those of the conventional five-piece wheel. The two-piece wheel design completely removed the possibility of wheel failure due to mismatched wheel components; the fatigue lives were increased by over two orders of magnitude, compared to the conventional five-piece wheel...|$|R

Unlike Winchester Short Magnum cartridges, the Ruger Compact Magnums share the same diameter from case head to body. This allowed Ruger to chamber the cartridge without extensively redesigning their M77 rifle to adopt them to the new Ruger cartridge.|$|R
