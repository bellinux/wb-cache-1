In 2007, {{approximately}} 4.1million Swedes—almost 44% of the country's population—watched the final, and between 2.9million and 3.2million viewers watched {{each of the}} semifinals. The viewing figures for the 2007 festival are nearly two million short of the highest recorded viewing figures from 1990. Melodifestivalen is given heavy coverage in the Swedish press. A study by the Economic Science and Communication Department at Karlstad University concluded that coverage from the press may have influenced {{the results of the}} 2007 festival.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} segment {{most likely}} to develop lung cancer is people aged over 50 who {{have a history of}} smoking. In contrast to the mortality rate in men, which began declining more than 20 years ago, women's lung cancer mortality rates have <b>been</b> <b>rising</b> over the last decades, and are just recently beginning to stabilize. In the USA, the lifetime risk of developing lung cancer is 8% in men and 6% in women.|$|E
5|$|Blackcaps {{and other}} small birds are {{illegally}} trapped and hunted in large numbers in Mediterranean countries, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Malta, Libya, Egypt and Cyprus, where they are considered as a delicacy. Despite hunting and natural hazards, the European population of the blackcap has <b>been</b> <b>rising</b> for several decades as the range extends northwards, for example to Scotland and Denmark. There are occasional nesting records from outside the main range, such as in northern Israel and the Faroes, and wandering birds may appear further afield in Iceland or on the islands of Arctic Russia. In the Baltic, {{the spread of the}} blackcap appears to have been helped by the availability of territories formerly occupied by the declining barred warbler.|$|E

He does not mean, [...] "I am not sure whether you <b>are</b> <b>risen</b> or not; but perhaps you are not; but if you are, you ought to do such and such things." [...] He does not mean that. He was quite sure that these Colossians <b>were</b> <b>risen</b> with Christ. He had no doubt of it whatsoever. If you look at the chapter before, he says so. He tells them that they were buried with Christ in baptism, in which also they <b>were</b> <b>risen</b> with Christ, through faith of the {{operation}} of God, who has raised Him from the dead.|$|R

5|$|In 2000, {{about six}} million people lived within the Columbia's {{drainage}} basin. Of this total about 2.4million {{people lived in}} Oregon, 1.7million in Washington, 1million in Idaho, half a million in British Columbia, and 0.4million in Montana. Population in the watershed has <b>been</b> <b>rising</b> for many decades and is projected to rise to about 10million by 2030. The highest population densities are found west of the Cascade Mountains along the I-5 corridor, especially in the Portland-Vancouver urban area. High densities are also found around Spokane, Washington, and Boise, Idaho. Although much of the watershed is rural and sparsely populated, areas with recreational and scenic values are growing rapidly. The central Oregon county of Deschutes is the fastest-growing in the state. Populations have also been growing {{just east of the}} Cascades in central Washington around the city of Yakima and the Tri-Cities area. Projections for the coming decades assume growth throughout the watershed, including the interior. The Canadian part of the Okanagan subbasin is also growing rapidly.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of the Bastille {{at the time was}} Bernard-René de Launay, a conscientious but minor military officer. Tensions surrounding the Bastille had <b>been</b> <b>rising</b> for several weeks. Only eight prisoners remained in the fortress, but one of these, the Marquis de Sade, had stoked the link between the revolution and the Bastille, addressing the public from his walks on top of the towers and, once this was forbidden, shouting from the window of his cell. Sade began to claim that the authorities planned to massacre the prisoners in the castle, which resulted in the governor removing him to an alternative site in early July.|$|E
5|$|Tokyo Tower's {{two main}} revenue sources are antenna leasing and tourism. It {{functions}} as a radio and television broadcasting antenna support structure and is a tourist destination that houses several different attractions. Over 150million people have visited the tower in total since its opening in late 1958. Tower attendance had been steadily declining until it bottomed out at 2.3million in 2000. Since then, attendance has <b>been</b> <b>rising,</b> and it has recently been attracting approximately 3million visitors per year. The first area tourists must visit upon reaching the tower is FootTown, a four-story building stationed directly under the tower. Here, visitors can eat, shop and visit several museums and galleries. Elevators that depart from {{the first floor of}} FootTown can be used to reach the first of two observation decks, the two-story Main Observatory. For the price of another ticket, visitors can board another set of elevators from {{the second floor of the}} Main Observatory to reach the final observation deckthe Special Observatory.|$|E

5|$|Worldwide, more {{chickens}} {{are kept}} {{than any other}} type of poultry, with over 50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs. Traditionally, such birds would have been kept extensively in small flocks, foraging during the day and housed at night. This is still the case in developing countries, where the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry. However, rising world populations and urbanization have led to the bulk of production being in larger, more intensive specialist units. These are often situated close to where the feed is grown or near to where the meat is needed, and result in cheap, safe food being made available for urban communities. Profitability of production depends very much on the price of feed, which has <b>been</b> <b>rising.</b> High feed costs could limit further development of poultry production.|$|E
5|$|Leftist {{influence}} in Syria grew {{further in the}} immediate wake of the crisis; on 15 August, a high-ranking officer from Sidon, Lebanon with Marxist leanings, Afif Bizri, was appointed army chief of staff, and several mid-level officers were replaced with communist officers. Quwatli flew to Egypt amid apparent plans to resign from the presidency {{in favor of the}} Soviet-leaning Azm. However, he returned to Syria on 26 August. Tensions had <b>been</b> <b>rising</b> as rumors swept the region regarding a US-backed Turkish or joint Iraqi-Jordanian invasion of Syria to prevent a potential communist takeover. Quwatli's earlier success in repairing ties between Syria and Saudi Arabia proved particularly useful during this period. Saud immediately lent his full support to Quwatli, whom he viewed as a significant counterweight to the leftist movement, by rebuffing President Dwight D. Eisenhower's appeal to endorse the Eisenhower Doctrine, a policy aimed at containing communist and Arab nationalist {{influence in}} the Middle East. He also accepted an invitation to Damascus by Quwatli on 25 August, publicly stating that Saudi Arabia would support Syria in any aggression against it. Iraqi Prime Minister Ali Jawdat also proclaimed support for Syria when he visited on 26 August, in spite of support for an attack by the Iraqi monarchy. Both Saud and Jawdat privately criticized Syria's leadership for increasing dependence on the Eastern bloc.|$|E
