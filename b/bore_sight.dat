50|$|The <b>Bore</b> <b>Sight</b> Range and Compass Swinging Platform remain {{substantially}} {{intact and}} {{are important in}} demonstrating the principal characteristics of their types. The <b>bore</b> <b>sight</b> range retains its concrete hardstand, cleared range and earth butt. The circular concrete slab of the compass swinging platform remains adjacent to the wartime runway, and retains its compass rose inscription.|$|E

50|$|Very little {{evidence}} of the Army remains. Tucked away in a remote part of the airport can be found a taxiway with the base's former <b>bore</b> <b>sighting</b> range and revetment. Still in evidence is a small pit on the range's taxiway for a P-39's nose gear. The pit has a sloped entry that lowered the P-39's nose to allow the <b>bore</b> <b>sighting</b> of the guns. Taildraggers such as the P-40 and P-51 {{had to have the}} tail jacked up to bring the guns to bear. The original Army light beacon was also in evidence in 2004.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{normally}} desirable {{to keep the}} sights of a firearm {{as close to the}} bore as possible, since a firearm with a large <b>bore</b> to <b>sight</b> distance will require more sight adjustment when shifting between shooting at different targets at close ranges. On the other hand, a firearm with a short <b>bore</b> to <b>sight</b> distance will need less sight adjustment when changing between targets at close ranges. At longer ranges the <b>bore</b> to <b>sight</b> distance will be of less importance, since gravity has affected the projectile so much that the height difference between the <b>bore</b> and the <b>sight</b> has less to say in total, compared to the bullet drop.|$|R
50|$|Charters Towers Airport has a {{heritage}} listing for the <b>Bore</b> <b>Sight</b> Range and Compass Swinging Platform established during World War II.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bore</b> <b>Sight</b> Range and Compass Swinging Platform at Charters Towers Airfield {{were listed}} on the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 May 2010 having {{satisfied}} the following criteria.|$|E
50|$|Saegmuller invented or {{contributed to}} the {{development}} of a multitude of devices. He held more than 35 patents. His inventions include the solar attachment for engineering transits, a new type of naval <b>bore</b> <b>sight,</b> and numerous telescopes and telescope mounts.|$|E
5000|$|Today, {{there is}} very little left to show that the area was once an airfield. Other than the {{overgrown}} runways, taxiways, revetments, munitions bunkers and the <b>bore</b> <b>sighting</b> range, the only structure that still exists on the former military airfield is a water fountain which must have belonged to Livingston House. The area is very overgrown, access is limited by [...] "keep out" [...] signs.|$|R
50|$|No {{matter which}} method of <b>bore</b> <b>sighting</b> is used, {{the result is}} to align the cross-hairs of the scope {{to the spot where}} the barrel is {{pointing}} at a particular distance. Because of variations in the trajectory of ammunition and other factors the bore-sighted rifle will probably not shoot to the exact spot that the cross-hairs indicate, and live ammunition will need to be fired to fine-tune the sighting process.|$|R
40|$|The Voyager {{infrared}} investigation uses a Michelson interferometer (IRIS) {{covering the}} spectral range from 200 to 3000 cm/ 1 (3. 3 to 50 micrometers) and a <b>bore</b> <b>sighted</b> radiometer covering the range from 5000 to 25000 cm/ 1 (0. 4 to 2 micrometers). The spectral {{resolution of the}} interferometer is 4. 3 cm/ 1 and {{the field of view}} is 0. 25 deg. Scientific results anticipated from the investigation of the Saturnian system are discussed...|$|R
50|$|During mid-February 1943 the Department of Public Works {{received}} a requisition from the US Army {{for construction of}} a gun firing range, or <b>bore</b> <b>sight</b> range, platform at Charters Towers airfield to test the accuracy of aircraft fixed armament. The work order was lodged with the superintending engineer, Department of Interior, Townsville. The concrete gun firing platform was designed with an adjustable metal plate set {{in front of the}} concrete block to take the nose wheel of aircraft with tricycle undercarriages, such as the B-25. A steel gantry frame with a sling was positioned on the platform to lift the tail of fighter aircraft with tail wheels such as the P-40. The <b>bore</b> <b>sight</b> range extended about 360 metres to an earth mound, or butt, in front of which a target was set.|$|E
50|$|The Compass Swinging Platform {{is located}} about 850m {{south-east}} of the <b>Bore</b> <b>Sight</b> Range's hardstand (in the suburb of Columbia), {{on the northern}} side of the wartime NE- SW runway, near its central point. It comprises a circular concrete slab 120 feet 6 inches (36.7 metres) in diameter with a compass rose inscribed on the surface.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bore</b> <b>Sight</b> Range and Compass Swinging Platform are a heritage-listed pair of {{aircraft}} testing facilities at Charters Towers Airport, Charters Towers, Charters Towers Region, Queensland, Australia. They were built from 1942 to 1943. They are {{also known as}} Charters Towers WWII Airfield Gun Firing Range and Compass Swinging Station. They {{were added to the}} Queensland Heritage Register on 14 May 2010.|$|E
40|$|The {{status of}} the OCO {{instrument}} optical design is presented in this paper. The optical bench assembly comprises three cooled grating spectrometers coupled to an all-reflective telescope/relay system. Dichroic beam splitters are used to separate the light from a common telescope into the three spectral bands. The three <b>bore</b> <b>sighted</b> spectrometers allow the total column CO 2 absorption path to be corrected for optical path and surface pressure uncertainties, aerosols, and water vapor. The design of the instrument is based on classic flight proven technologies...|$|R
40|$|The {{data to be}} {{acquired}} from Geosynchronous Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer (GIFTS) instrument, under development for the NASA New Millennium Program, presents a shift from the scanning approach to global coverage used almost exclusively by current and recent instruments. The focal plane array detector and the <b>bore</b> <b>sighted</b> CCD camera will cover the earth in 512 x 512 km sized “frames”. The GIFTS sensor itself is equipped with servo-controlled pointing mirrors {{to help in the}} data acquisition process. We describe below the approach for the post-fact geolocation of the acquired data. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 1...|$|R
40|$|Six {{receivers}} for the MicroWave Radiometer (MWR) {{are currently}} under development at JPL. These receivers cover a frequency range of 0. 6 to 22 GHz in approximately octave steps, with 4 % bandwidth. For calibration and diagnosis three noise diodes and a Dicke switch are integrated into each receiver. Each receiver {{is connected to}} its own antenna which is mounted with its <b>bore</b> <b>sights</b> perpendicular to the spin axis of the spacecraft. As the spacecraft spins at 2 RPM, the antenna field of view scans Jupiter's atmosphere from limb to nadir to limb, measuring microwave emission down to 1000 -bar...|$|R
50|$|As laser {{technology}} {{has become less}} expensive, laser bore sighters have become popular for sighting in rifles. One type of laser <b>bore</b> <b>sight</b> is inserted into the chamber and projects a beam through the barrel onto the target. The user then adjusts the rifle scope until the crosshairs are on the laser dot. Another type of laser bore sighter is more universal and {{is attached to the}} end of the barrel. It is held in alignment with the barrel and projects a laser beam onto the target. Again, the user aligns the crosshairs to the laser dot on the target.|$|E
50|$|Aligned {{approximately}} east-west off {{the northern}} end of the wartime north-south runway (in the adjacent suburb of Toll), the <b>Bore</b> <b>Sight</b> Range includes an aircraft hardstand {{in the form of a}} raised concrete platform approximately 15 metres square. A steel tie down shackle is set into the concrete surface. An adjustable metal plate, which can be raised or lowered, is set at the front of the raised hardstand to carry the nose wheel of aircraft fitted with tricycle undercarriages. A cleared range extends east about 360 metres from the hardstand to the original earth butt, in front of which a recent display target is set.|$|E
50|$|Charters Towers Airfield was {{constructed}} for the United States Army in early 1942 to provide dispersal facilities {{for the main}} Townsville air base at Garbutt, {{in the event of}} Japanese air raids during World War II. During 1942 the US 3rd Bombardment Group was based at Charters Towers while undertaking strikes against Japanese bases in the south-west Pacific. From 1943 the airfield served as a US aircraft replacement and training centre. Facilities constructed during this period which remain include a <b>bore</b> <b>sight</b> range (a gun firing range used to check the alignment of the fixed guns of an aircraft) and a compass swinging station (used to check for magnetic deviation in an aircraft compass).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} chosen {{activities of}} the ships propulsion system shafting alignment procedure. The main focus in this paper was put on <b>sighting</b> through (<b>bore</b> <b>sighting)</b> which {{can be done with}} three different types of measurement equipment: piano were, optical instruments and laser instruments. The analysis of measurement equipment allows selection of most optimal measurement solution for company. The matter of this selection is to avoid hazard to the shaft line due to shafts misalignment. Presented in paper measuring techniques and measurement equipment which is being used for sighting trough the elements of ships propulsion system meet technological requirements requested by the client and by the ship classification society...|$|R
500|$|Rheinmetall {{introduced}} a larger 130mm tank gun at Eurosatory 2016 in June 2016. [...] Development commenced in 2015, financed entirely using internal funding, {{as a response}} to the Russian introduction of new generation armored vehicles like the T-14 Armata tank, and the first technical demonstrator (TD) was completed in May 2016. [...] The new 130mm gun has an L/51 chrome-lined smoothbore barrel with a vertical sliding breech mechanism, increased chamber volume, no muzzle brake, a thermal sleeve, and a muzzle reference system (MRS) enabling it to be <b>bore</b> <b>sighted</b> on a more regular basis without the crew needing to leave the platform. [...] Compared to the 2700kg 120mm gun, the 130mm has a [...] barrel and an all-up weight of 3000kg including the recoil system.|$|R
60|$|Moments passed. I {{was just}} {{on the point of}} {{deciding}} to go down to hurry up my comrades, when I heard the other hounds coming. Yelp on yelp, bay on bay, made welcome music to my ears. Then a black and yellow, swiftly flying string of hounds <b>bore</b> into <b>sight</b> down the slope, streaked up and circled the piñon.|$|R
5000|$|The Section chief {{operates}} the hydraulic load and ram, verification with [...] "Gunner's Quadrant", {{as well as}} operating the rear spade and left spade unlock. The driver {{operates the}} positions spade and the barrel travel lock. The gunner controls deflection (the horizontal direction in which the gun is pointing). The Assistant gunner controls elevation. The Number one cannoneer opens and closes the breech, verifies ramming of the round with ram rod and powder load red on the rag (which means {{he can see the}} red igniter patch to verify that the powder is not put in backwards), loads the primer, hooks up the lanyard (pig tail), pulls lanyard on command, and unlocks the right spade lock. Cannoneers two through nine set up the collimator (US Army Tm 9-2300-216-10), aiming stakes, <b>bore</b> <b>sight</b> (For Direct Fire missions only), communications, prepare additional ammunition (including fuzing) and powder zones, provide security, drive the M548, operate the ring-mounted M2 [...]50 caliber machine gun, set up camouflage nets, dig a burn pit, and conduct the resupply of ammunition.|$|E

60|$|In the drawing-room {{they found}} the Squire puzzling over a sheet of paper, on which were scrawled some of George's accounts, in figures which at first <b>sight</b> <b>bore</b> about as much {{resemblance}} to Egyptian hieroglyphics as they did to those in use to-day.|$|R
40|$|The Arthur Holly Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO) was {{launched}} by the shuttle Atlantis in April 1991. This paper {{presents the results of}} the attitude sensor calibration that was performed during the early mission. The GSFC Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF) performed an alignment calibration of the two fixed-head star trackers (FHST's) and two fine Sun sensors (FSS's) on board Compton GRO. The results show a 27 -arcsecond shift between the <b>bore</b> <b>sights</b> of the FHST's with respect to prelaunch measurements. The alignments of the two FSS's shifted by 0. 20 and 0. 05 degree. During the same time period, the Compton GRO science teams performed an alignment calibration of the science instruments with respect to the attitude reported by the on board computer (OBC). In order to preserve these science alignments, FDF adjusted the overall alignments of the FHST's and FSS's, obtained by the FDF calibration, such that when up linked to the OBC, the shift in the OBC-determined attitude is minimized. FDF also calibrated the inertial reference unit (IRU), which consists of three dual-axis gyroscopes. The observed gyro bias matched the bias that was solved for by the OBC. This bias drifted during the first 6 days after release. The results of the FDF calibration of scale factor and alignment shifts showed changes that were of the same order as their uncertainties...|$|R

It assumes sights 1.5 inches (38 mm) above the <b>bore</b> line, and <b>sights</b> adjusted to result in point of aim and point of impact matching 200&thinsp;yards (183&thinsp;m) and 300&thinsp;yards (274&thinsp;m) respectively.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{calculation}} method for <b>bore</b> <b>sight</b> error voltage is presented for aperture antennas enclosed in radomes of arbitrary shapes. The method adopts a ray tracing technique frequently used in computer graphics field in constructing two dimensional computer graphics images {{to obtain a}} projected image of source distribution, thereby <b>bore</b> <b>sight</b> error voltages and far field radiation patterns are calculated fast and accurately. Besides, the method enables us to use various acceleration schemes used in computer graphics readily. Numerical calculations show that projected source images with a resolution higher than 0. 1 λ and multiple reflections taken into account produce reliable results. The validity of the method is verified by comparison with results of an analytic solution. 1...|$|E

The existing flow pattern maps of Taitel-Dukler and Hashizume poorly represented the data while the VDI map identified the flow pattern rather successfully, {{with the exception of}} mist flows. Methods used in horizontal flow boiling correlations to determine the threshold between all wet wall and partially wet wall flow were shown to be very unreliable...|$|E

60|$|It {{happened}} that a heavy wooden peg {{had been driven}} into the ridge-pole just above Jim Cardegee's head. Jacob Kent, working softly, ran a piece of half-inch manila over it, bringing both ends to the ground. One end he tied about his waist, {{and in the other}} he rove a running noose. Then he cocked his shotgun and laid it within reach, by the side of numerous moose-hide thongs. By an effort of will he <b>bore</b> the <b>sight</b> of the scar, slipped the noose over the sleeper's head, and drew it taut by throwing back on his weight, at the same time seizing the gun and bringing it to bear.|$|R
60|$|He was gone. From {{down the}} street to their left rose shouts and the sound of many running feet, but there in front of them loomed the Tower against the black and rainy sky. They dashed across the little {{drawbridge}} that spanned the moat, and, seizing the cranks, wound furiously. Slowly, ah! how slowly it rose, for it was heavy, and they were but two tired men; also the chains and cogs were rusty with disuse. Yet it did rise, and as it came home at last, the fierce mob, thirsting for their blood and guessing where they would refuge, appeared in front of it and by the light of some torches which they <b>bore,</b> caught <b>sight</b> of them.|$|R
40|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory {{developed}} a space-qualified High Resolution (HiRes) imaging LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) system {{for use on}} the DoD Clementine mission. The Clementine mission provided more than 1. 7 million images of the moon, earth, and stars, including the first ever complete systematic surface mapping of the moon from the ultra-violet to near-infrared spectral regions. This article describes the Clementine HiRes/LIDAR system, discusses design goals and preliminary estimates of on-orbit performance, and summarizes lessons learned in building and using the sensor. The LIDAR receiver system consists of a High Resolution (HiRes) imaging channel which incorporates an intensified multi-spectral visible camera combined with a Laser ranging channel which uses an avalanche photo-diode for laser pulse detection and timing. The receiver was <b>bore</b> <b>sighted</b> to a light-weight McDonnell-Douglas diode-pumped ND:YAG laser transmitter that emmitted 1. 06 {micro}m wavelength pulses of 200 mJ/pulse and 10 ns pulse-width, The LIDAR receiver uses a common F/ 9. 5 Cassegrain telescope assembly. The optical path of the telescope is split using a color-separating beamsplitter. The imaging channel incorporates a filter wheel assembly which spectrally selects the light which is imaged onto a custom 12 mm gated image intensifier fiber-optically-coupled into a 384 x 276 pixel frame transfer CCD FPA. The image intensifier was spectrally sensitive over the 0. 4 to 0. 8 {micro}m wavelength region. The six-position filter wheel contained 4 narrow spectral filters, one broadband and one blocking filter. At periselene (400 km) the HiRes/LIDAR imaged a 2. 8 km swath width at 20 -meter resolution. The LIDAR function detected differential signal return with a 40 -meter range accuracy, with a maximum range capability of 640 km, limited by the bit counter in the range return counting clock...|$|R
