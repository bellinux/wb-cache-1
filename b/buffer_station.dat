40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of station buffer {{capacity}} {{on the performance of}} token ring networks. The network is modelled as a multi-queue system with a single cyclic server, one finite buffer queue and an arbitrary number of infinite buffer queues. Approximate average message delays for both the finite and infinite buffer stations and the probability of message blocking at the finite <b>buffer</b> <b>station</b> are derived, and numerical results are presented. Interesting conclusions are obtained when we compare network performance when the network traffic load is completely balanced with the case when the finite <b>buffer</b> <b>station</b> is much more heavily loaded than the individual infinite buffer stations. The latter situation would arise, for example, in the interconnected networks employing gateways or bridges...|$|E
30|$|In the mailbox-based {{approach}} [16], every MH {{is associated}} with a mailbox, which is a data structure residing at a mobility agent. If a sender wants to send a packet to an MH, it simply sends the packet to the receiver's mailbox no matter how the current location of the MH is. The mailbox acts as a relay and <b>buffer</b> <b>station</b> of MH. The mailbox forwards the buffered traffic to the MH based on the binding information maintained in it. Although HH-MIP and mailbox share a similar idea to some extent, there are some significant differences between them and will be discussed in Section 3.3.|$|E
40|$|The “chicken-egg ” dilemma between VLSI {{interconnect}} timing optimization {{and delay}} calculation suggests an iterative approach. We separate interconnect timing transformation as Hanan grafting and non-Hanan sliding, and reveal generally negligible contribution of non-Hanan sliding. We propose a greedy iterative interconnect timing optimization algorithm called Q-Tree. Our experimental {{results show that}} Q-Tree starting with Steiner minimum tree topologies achieves better timing performance than C-Tree [1], PER-Steiner [5] and BA-Tree [14] algorithms. Also, executing Q-Tree starting with BA-Tree or P-Tree [13] topologies can achieve better timing performance, especially, with shorter wires and fewer buffers. In general, Q-Tree {{can be applied to}} any interconnect tree for further timing performance improvement, with practical instance sizes and easily-extended functionality- e. g., with <b>buffer</b> <b>station</b> and routing obstacle avoidance consideration. ...|$|E

40|$|Research into {{production}} scheduling environments has been {{primarily concerned with}} developing local priority rules for selecting jobs from a queue to be processed {{on a set of}} individual machines. Most of the research deals with the scheduling problems in terms of the evaluation of priority rules with respect to given criteria. These criteria have a direct effect on the production cost, such as mean make-span, flow-time, job lateness, m-process inventory and machine idle time. The project under study consists of the following two phases. The first is to deal with the development of computer models for the flow-shop problem, which obtain the optimum make-span and near-optimum solutions for the well-used criteria in the production scheduling priority rules. The second is to develop experimental analysis using a simulation technique, for the two main manufacturing systems, 1. Job-shop 2. Flexible Manufacturing System The two manufacturing types were investigated under the following conditions i. Dynamic problem conditions ii. Different operation time distributions iii. Different shop loads iv. Seven replications per experiment with different streams of random number v. The approximately steady state point for each replication was obtained. In the FMS, the material handling system used was the automated guided Vehicles (AGVs), <b>buffer</b> <b>station</b> and load/ unload area were also used.

In assembly shops, after finishing the assembly operations in the main line and signing off the automobile, it enters the retouch line in order to be adjusted and repaired if required. There are several stations to fix the probable defects that the product may have. Since the defects and the time required to fix them are stochastic parameters and there are recursive flows between the stations, it is crucial to study and optimize the number of the work <b>stations</b> and the <b>buffer</b> <b>stations.</b> In this study, the retouch line for production of Logan in ParsKhodro Company is simulated by Arena software.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the first in-depth study on dual-Vdd buffer insertion for power minimization under delay constraint. Compared with delay-optimal single Vdd buffer insertion, the dual-Vdd buffer insertion reduces power by 16 %. Such power reduction increases when the delay specification is relaxed. Whereas the van Ginneken algorithm {{can be extended}} to handle the new problem formulation optimally, its time complexity increases from quadratic time (O(|B|n 2)) to pseudopolynomial time (O(|B|n 3 c 2 max log(ncmax)), where |B | {{is the size of}} buffer library, n is the number of <b>buffer</b> <b>stations,</b> and cmax is proportional to the number of all possible subtrees of the net. To improve the time complexity, we propose an approximation technique by sampling subsolutions (i. e., options) and apply predictive min-delay and prebuffer slack pruning rules from a related work. Experiments show that sampling is most effective to reduce run time, whereas the two pruning rules further improve efficiency and accuracy loss due to sampling. We show that our proposed algorithm has linear time complexity with respect to the tree size. It runs over 1000 times faster at a cost of less than 2 % delay and power increase over the extended van Ginneken algorithm. Index Terms—Buffer insertion, delay, dual-Vdd, low power. I...|$|R

The simulation model incorporates a common insertion <b>buffer</b> for <b>station</b> and ring packets. Bandwidth allocation is achieved by imposing a queue limit at each node. A simple priority scheme is introduced by allowing the queue limit to vary from node to node. This enables voice traffic to be given priority over data. The effect on {{performance of}} various operational and design parameters such as ratio of voice to data traffic, queue limit and voice packet size is investigated. Comparisons are made where possible with related work on other protocols proposed for voice-data integration. The main conclusions are: (a) {{there is a general}} degradation of performance as the ratio of voice traffic to data traffic increases, (b) substantial improvement in performance can be achieved by restricting the queue length at data nodes and (c) for a given ring utilisation, smaller voice packets result in lower delays for both voice and data traffic...|$|R
