25|$|Bread and Alley was {{my first}} {{experience}} in cinema and I must say a very difficult one. I {{had to work with}} a very young child, a dog, and an unprofessional crew except for the cinematographer, who was nagging and complaining all the time. Well, the cinematographer, in a sense, was right <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not follow the conventions of film making that he had become accustomed to.|$|E
500|$|Benny Friedman held {{a grudge}} against Little {{for refusing to}} start him at quarterback during the 1924 season. [...] He later recalled: [...] "I could not play quarterback for Coach Little, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not personify what he wanted. [...] Now, under Yost, I was the quarterback, and this game meant much to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Morgan {{attended}} Diamond Bar High School, {{where she}} was a three-time all-league pick and was named All-American by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA). At the school, she was known for her speed and sprinting ability. Morgan played for Olympic Development Program (ODP) regional and state teams as well. She later credited the program {{as an integral part}} of her development as a soccer player: [...] "... programs like ODP helped me especially <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> come into the club scene late and it was important for me to play as much as possible, play with the best players and learn from the best coaches. That, for me, was crucial to my development." ...|$|E

500|$|In the season-ending RAC Rally in Great Britain, Mouton {{continued}} her good performances by running third at half distance, despite having been uncomfortable about competing in a rally where pacenotes and practice are not allowed. However, her Quattro later incurred gearbox problems and she retired from fifth place after sliding {{off the road}} into a snow-filled ditch. Mouton would later state: [...] "For me, rallying is England. No pacenotes – just you in the car having to do the fastest time. This, to me, is rallying. OK, {{it was not easy}} for me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not have experience there of the British championship, but it is really rallying. I like it very much." [...] Mouton finished the season in eighth place in the drivers' championship, while Audi was fifth in the manufacturers' standings.|$|E
500|$|During {{the last}} years of his life, Hughes began working on a fuller {{publication}} of Plath's journals. In 1998, shortly before his death, he unsealed the two journals, and passed the project onto his children by Plath, Frieda and Nicholas, who passed it on to Karen V. Kukil. Kukil finished her editing in December 1999, and in 2000 Anchor Books published The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath (Plath 2000). More than half of the new volume contained newly released material; The American author Joyce Carol Oates hailed the publication as a [...] "genuine literary event". Hughes faced criticism for his role in handling the journals: he claims to have destroyed Plath's last journal, which contained entries from the winter of 1962 up to her death. In the foreword of the 1982 version, he writes, [...] "I destroyed [...] <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not want her children to have to read it (in those days I regarded forgetfulness as an essential part of survival)." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2013, Jared Leto told MTV News {{that he was}} {{preparing}} to shoot a short film for [...] "City of Angels". While he did not reveal much about the music video concept, he added: [...] "It's going to be powerful and emotional and definitely something special." [...] The shooting took place from August 16–17 in Los Angeles, filming multiple monoliths and murals. Leto interviewed celebrities who joined the three members of Thirty Seconds to Mars in sharing their visions about Los Angeles. He also recruited Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe impersonators as well as homeless people {{in the production of}} the video. After filming, Leto talked about the inspiration behind the video, stating, [...] "Telling stories {{is a big part of}} what I do, so it was a really natural and comfortable thing. I think <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> all the interviews myself—I talked to fellow artists and they felt really comfortable. They shared a side of themselves that we don't share very often." [...] Footage from the song's lyric video, which was shot atop the Hollywood Hills, was used for a part of the short film that featured Leto singing the song against the backdrop of a Los Angeles sunset.|$|E

2500|$|As {{early as}} , Thomas was advocating drug testing for {{professional}} baseball players. After hitting his 500th home run, Thomas stated, [...] "It {{means a lot}} to me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it the right way", alluding to Barry Bonds's then-ongoing pursuit of Hank Aaron's career home run record. Thomas was, then, the only active baseball player to be interviewed during the preparation of the Mitchell Report. He did so voluntarily.|$|E
2500|$|Burton said, [...] "I've never studied acting or {{anything}} because I've been so lucky with MTV. I'm convinced I {{got the chance}} to be on One Tree Hill <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a guest thing on Dawson's Creek as myself, when the cast appeared at the MTV Beach House." [...] She added, [...] "And my only scene was with Chad Michael Murray (Lucas Scott). So, now The Chad and I are reunited. How bizarre is that?" [...] With regard to what her life is like as an actress, Burton said, [...] "Actors like to think their lives are very difficult, but they're not. Yeah, you're running around a lot. But I used to work in a supermarket and in a bar. That was hard. This is fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|The main thesis was Mrs. Von Harbou's, but I am {{at least}} 50 percent {{responsible}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it. I {{was not so}} politically minded in those days as I am now. You cannot make a social-conscious picture in which {{you say that the}} intermediary between the hand and the brain is the heart. I mean, that's a fairy tale– definitely. But I was very interested in machines. Anyway, I didn't like the picture– thought it was silly and stupid– then, when I saw the astronauts: what else are they but part of a machine? It's very hard to talk about pictures—should I say now that I like Metropolis because something I have seen in my imagination comes true, when I detested it after it was finished? ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the video}} Voris {{admitted}} {{it may have}} been a mistake on his part not to have brought this information to the public earlier, but that he did not feel it necessary to provide all the details in order to proclaim the Gospel. [...] "I did not do it to deceive, but <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand the necessity. Now, I do," [...] he said. At the end of the video, he says, [...] "We will never cease to declare these truths, the glories of the Catholic faith, regardless of what happens. If this is all threatened because of revelations of my past sins, then please pray that the will of God be done. Thank you for your prayers, your support and your understanding, as well as the measure of forgiveness you are ready to extend." ...|$|E
2500|$|I must enjoy {{myself and}} tell you about Madame C. Royer who {{translated}} the Origin into French and for which 2d edition I took infinite trouble. She has now just brought out a 3d edition without informing me {{so that all the}} corrections to the 4th and 5th editions are lost. Besides her enormously long and blasphemous preface to the 1st edition she has added a 2nd preface abusing me like a pick-pocket for pangenesis which of course has no relation to Origin. Her motive being, I believe, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not employ her to translate [...] "Domestic animals". So I wrote to Paris; & Reinwald agrees to bring out at once a new translation for the 5th English Edition in Competition with her 3e edition [...] So shall I not serve her well?

2500|$|Walter Pincus, a Washington Post columnist, has {{reported}} that he was told in confidence by an unnamed Bush administration official on July 12, 2003, two days before Novak's column appeared, that [...] "the White House had not paid attention to former Ambassador Joseph Wilson's CIA-sponsored February 2002 trip to Niger because it was set up as a boondoggle by his wife, {{an analyst with the}} agency working on weapons of mass destruction." [...] Because he did not believe it to be true, Pincus claims, he did not report the story in The Washington Post until October 12, 2003: [...] "I wrote my October story <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not think the person who spoke to me was committing a criminal act, but only practicing damage control by {{trying to get me to}} stop writing about Wilson. Because of that article, The Washington Post and I received subpoenas last summer from Patrick J. Fitzgerald." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rather than {{accepting}} {{responsibility for}} a transgression through {{the form of an}} apology, a transgressor who explains why they engaged in a behavior is engaging in excuses or justifications. [...] While excuses and justifications aim to minimize blame on the transgressor, the two address blame minimization from completely opposite perspectives. Excuses attempt to minimize blame by focusing on a transgressor’s inability to control their actions (e.g., “How would I have known my exgirlfriend was {{going to be at the}} party.”) or displace blame on a third party (e.g., “I went to lunch with my exgirlfriend <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not want to hurt her feelings.”). [...] Conversely, a justification minimizes blame by suggesting that actions surrounding the transgression were justified or that the transgression was not severe. [...] For example, a transgressor may justify having lunch with a past romantic interest, suggesting to their current partner that the lunch meeting was of no major consequence (e.g., “We are just friends.”).|$|E
2500|$|In June 2014, Derby {{rejected}} {{an offer}} from Burnley for Bryson. Bryson was however given permission to speak to Burnley, later saying that [...] "it doesn't matter what team it is, when someone puts an offer in for you I think you owe them the respect {{to sit down and}} speak to them... but just <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that didn't mean I was going to sign for them." [...] Soon afterwards, he agreed a new five-year contract with Derby, saying that his bond with the fans was {{part of the reason that}} he chose to stay: [...] "I've got a good bond with the fans as well and that was a big part in my decision to stay here. The fans have been excellent ever since I walked through the door. When you come to a new club it can take time to win over the fans, but they have been fantastic with me... they helped me make the biggest decision of my career, if not my life. I took a while to think about it and I knew it would be a massive decision. I went through stages where one minute I thought I was leaving and then the next minute I think I'm staying. But in the end it turned out to be an easy decision for me because Derby are such a great club to be part of." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{legacies}} {{include the}} parents' beliefs in Freemasonry, Republicanism with elements of Anarchism and Marxism. Austere freethinkers with an intense {{hatred of the}} ruling National Fascist Party, Eva and Mario also refused to give their sons any education in the Catholic Faith or any other religion. Italo attended the English nursery school St George's College, followed by a Protestant elementary private school run by Waldensians. His secondary schooling, with a classical lyceum curriculum, was completed at the state-run Liceo Gian Domenico Cassini where, at his parents' request, he was exempted from religion classes but frequently asked to justify his anti-conformism to teachers, janitors, and fellow pupils. In his mature years, Calvino described the experience as having made him [...] "tolerant of others' opinions, particularly {{in the field of}} religion, remembering how irksome it was to hear myself mocked <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not follow the majority's beliefs". In 1938, Eugenio Scalfari, who went on to found the weekly magazine L'Espresso and La Repubblica, a major Italian newspaper, came from Civitavecchia to join the same class though a year younger, and they shared the same desk. The two teenagers formed a lasting friendship, Calvino attributing his political awakening to their university discussions. Seated together [...] "on a huge flat stone {{in the middle of a}} stream near our land", he and Scalfari founded the MUL (University Liberal Movement).|$|E
