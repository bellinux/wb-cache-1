50|$|Hackney ponies may be black, bay (which {{includes}} <b>brown),</b> <b>or</b> <b>chestnut.</b> Bay {{is by far}} {{the most}} common color, but black is also relatively common. Chestnuts, on the other hand, are extremely rare; their color is usually particularly light, and chestnut ponies often possess flaxen manes and tails. Many hackneys also have some white markings. Due to the sabino gene, common in the breed, the Hackney Pony may have white markings on its body as well as on its legs and head. The sabino gene (possibly a gene complex), is generally unpredictable, so breeding solely for body white marks can be difficult.|$|E

40|$|The horse {{evolution}} {{started with}} Hyracotherium, {{which was a}} small animal inhabiting forests of the Eocene. Since then, it evolved into more or less successful forms in which {{the conditions of the}} surroundings of its occurrence were reflected. When it comes to the initial usage of horses, they were used as a source of meat. Later, in the period before 4, 600 years ago, evidence of the domestication of these animals emerged. Due to the improved system of breeding, horse as a draught animal and a mean of transport gradually became riding horse, which contributed not only in spreading human population, but also in influencing history of many civilizations. 	Nowadays, horse is represented through a number of breeds, which are used in equestrian sport, work with cattle, horse races, in forestry labours, or as a good companion. 	In addition, horse gained its irreplaceable role {{in the service of the}} Mounted Police of Czech Republic where it is daily deployed in diverse actions; for example in city and peripheral guarding, in searching for missing persons or in restoration of disturbed public peace. The most useful breed for these purposes is Czech Warmblood, where the most preferred geldings are in <b>brown</b> <b>or</b> <b>chestnut</b> color. High demands are placed on physiological characteristics; however, the most important criterion is the excellent character of this breed. Quality of these characteristics consists in the length of duty and in the reasons for their release from duty. Some of the most frequent reasons for the release from duty health problems and age. The release due to age is associated with strong and resistant horses. 	Regarding the lineage of the police horses on duty, the best evaluated were the descendants of stallions 1154 Quick Lauro Z, Mykonos and 1028 Manillon Rouge. However, there is a correlation between these descendants and their number on active duty. After categorization of all traced stallions into relevant lineages, the lineage 1100 Przedswit became the most numerous lineages (7 stallions). Nevertheless, this lineage is not positively evaluated because of its descendants, which did not perform well on duty. Another numerous lineages were 5500 Pythagoras, 4700 Amour du Bois, Orange Peel xx-Almé Z, 67 Dark Ronald or 4800 Ladykiller XX. 	The central purchase system of duty horses should help to unify these horses as well as to prolong the length of duty, via universally established criteria. Results demonstrate the unification of typological characteristics of these horses. However, the average withers height of measured horses fails to meet the requirements. Regarding the length of duty, the results were not conclusive; therefore, the hypothesis was confirmed just partially...|$|E
5000|$|The Maremmano breed {{generally}} {{stands between}} [...] {{and is usually}} bay, <b>brown,</b> dark <b>chestnut</b> <b>or</b> black, although gray and roan are occasionally seen. It has a long, slightly heavy head, a muscular neck that is broad at the base, high, well-muscled withers, a full chest and sloping shoulders. The back is short, the croup sloping, and the legs solid and sturdy with good joints and strong hooves. The breed {{is known for its}} solidity and their ability to adapt to bad weather and rough terrain.|$|R
50|$|Overcooking will {{render the}} buds gray and soft, and they then develop a strong flavor and odor that some dislike. The odor is {{associated}} with the glucosinolate sinigrin, an organic compound that contains sulfur: hence the strong smell. For taste, roasting Brussels sprouts is a common way to cook them to bring out flavor. Common toppings or additions for Brussels sprouts include Parmesan cheese and butter, balsamic vinegar, apple cider vinegar, bacon, pistachios, pine nuts, mustard, <b>brown</b> sugar, <b>chestnuts</b> <b>or</b> pepper. Another popular way of cooking Brussels sprouts is to sauté them.|$|R
5000|$|Each Paint Horse has a {{particular}} combination of white and another color of the equine spectrum. Most common are horses with white spots combined with black, bay, <b>brown,</b> and <b>chestnut</b> <b>or</b> sorrel. Less common are horses with spot colors influenced by dilution genes such as palomino, buckskin, cremello, perlino, pearl or [...] "Barlink factor", and champagne, various shades of roan, or various shades of dun, including grullo. Paints may also carry the gray gene and have spots that eventually fade to white hair, though retaining pigmented skin underneath the areas that were once dark.|$|R
500|$|The typical Banker is {{relatively}} small, standing between [...] high at the withers and weighing [...] The forehead is broad and the facial profile {{tends to be}} straight or slightly convex. The chest is deep and narrow and the back is short with a sloped croup and low-set tail. Legs have an oval-shaped cannon bone, a trait considered indicative of [...] "strong bone" [...] or soundness. [...] The callousities known as chestnuts are small, on some so tiny that they are barely detectable. [...] Most Bankers have no chestnuts on the hind legs. The coat can be any color but is most often <b>brown,</b> bay, dun, <b>or</b> <b>chestnut.</b> Bankers have long-strided gaits and many are able to pace [...] and amble. They are easy keepers and are hardy, friendly, and docile.|$|R
500|$|The cap is {{hemispherical}} to convex, reaching [...] in diameter, although {{specimens of}} [...] {{have been found}} in some cases. Slightly velvety and lobed or dented, it is dark brown, greyish-brown, violet <b>brown,</b> <b>or</b> purple <b>brown,</b> often with copper, golden, or olivaceous patches. The stipe is [...] high by [...] wide, usually shorter than the cap diameter, initially barrel shaped but gradually becoming club shaped and tapering at the base. The stipe is pale <b>brown,</b> <b>chestnut,</b> <b>or</b> reddish <b>brown</b> in colour, covered in a <b>brown</b> <b>or</b> concolorous reticulation. Like in other boletes, there are tubes rather than gills {{on the underside of the}} cap. The tube openings—known as pores—are small and rounded. Whitish or greyish-white when young, they slowly become yellowish or greenish yellow at maturity, and can turn wine coloured with bruising. The tubes themselves are initially white, later becoming yellowish or olivaceous. The thick flesh is white, exudes a robust and pleasant smell reminiscent of hazelnuts, and has a mild sweet taste.|$|R
500|$|The typical Thoroughbred {{ranges from}} [...] high, {{averaging}} [...] They {{are most often}} bay, dark bay <b>or</b> <b>brown,</b> <b>chestnut,</b> black, <b>or</b> gray. [...] Less common colors recognized in the United States include roan and palomino. White is very rare, but is a recognized color separate from gray. [...] The face and lower legs may be marked with white, but white will generally not appear on the body. Coat patterns that {{have more than one}} color on the body, such as Pinto or Appaloosa, are not recognized by mainstream breed registries. [...] Good-quality Thoroughbreds have a well-chiseled head on a long neck, high withers, a deep chest, a short back, good depth of hindquarters, a lean body, and long legs. Thoroughbreds are classified among the [...] "hot-blooded" [...] breeds, which are animals bred for agility and speed and are generally considered spirited and bold.|$|R
50|$|Breeding occurs {{throughout}} {{the range of}} the buff-sided robin, with most breeding and nesting activity occurring across the warmer months and wet season between October and March with occasional dry season nesting records. Clutch size is generally two and eggs range in size from abbr=on 17.8 to 20.3 mm in length. The eggs vary considerably in terms of colouration, with a ground colour of light green to dark olive-green and with reddish <b>brown,</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>or</b> purplish-buff markings. Time between hatching and fledging of young is unknown. Buff-sided robin nests are occasionally targeted by interspecific avian brood parasites (cuckoos). J.P. Rogers observed buff-sided robin adults feeding an immature cuckoo, presumed to be a black-eared cuckoo (Chalcites osculans), on the Fitzroy River.|$|R
50|$|A pumapard is {{a hybrid}} animal {{resulting}} from a mating between a leopard and a puma (a member of the genus Puma, not the genus Panthera). Three sets of these hybrids were bred in the late 1890s and early 1900s by Carl Hagenbeck at his animal park in Hamburg, Germany. While most of these animals did not reach adulthood, one of these was purchased in 1898 by the Berlin Zoo. A similar hybrid in the Berlin Zoo purchased from Hagenbeck was {{a cross between a}} male leopard and a female puma. A specimen in the Hamburg Zoo (in the photo at right) was the reverse pairing, fathered by a puma bred to an Indian leopardess. The pumapard is characterised by a long body like the puma's, but with shorter legs. The hybrid is in general a dwarf, smaller than either parent. The coat is variously described as sandy, tawny <b>or</b> greyish with <b>brown,</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>or</b> faded rosettes.|$|R
