25|$|Discarding {{affects the}} {{environment}} in two ways; firstly, through increased mortality to target and non-target species, particularly at juvenile life-history stages, and secondly, through alteration of food webs by supplying increased levels of food to scavenging organisms on the sea floor, and to sea birds. The survival of discarded fish and invertebrates is variable and depends on species and fishing gear used. For example, species such as the Pacific halibut caught in long-line fisheries in the Bering Sea, or lesser spotted dogfish in <b>beam</b> <b>trawls</b> in the English Channel have survival rates of between 88-98%. Survival rates of roundfish discards are significantly lower, and this mortality is included in most International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) stock assessments.

40|$|The project WAKO {{wants to}} give a first attempt to map the current {{knowledge}} and the knowledge gaps {{on the effects of}} trammel net and <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries for the Belgian part of the North Sea. The project focuses on three ecosystem components, i. e. benthic invertebrates, sea birds and marine mammals. The aim of this project consists of three phases: (1) compilation and analysis of existing, experimental data for the Belgian part of the North Sea on the effects of trammel net and <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries; (2) current knowledge on the impact of <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> and trammel/gill net fisheries, based on literature review and (3) evaluation of the direct effects of <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> and trammel/gill net fisheries on three ecosystem components, knowledge gaps and investigation of an appropriate methodology to evaluate the environmental impact of fishing gears. WAKO indicates that direct, short-term effects of trammel net and <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries are clearly directed to different ecosystem components. Similarities between analogous, scientific studies allow a first evaluation of the effects, but quantitative data (on both biological impact data and data related to fishing effort and distribution) are so far insufficient to allow the development of a decision support tool for environmental and fisheries management...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{concern about}} the ecosystem effects of fishing on the marine environment and particularly, the impact of trawling on benthic communities is reflected in numerous publications. The weight of this concern will very likely only increase in management decisions in the near future. <b>Beam</b> <b>trawling</b> has a negative reputation with regard to discarding and seafloor impact and may be confronted with further constraints imposed by the fisheries management. The fishing industry has, however, the opportunity to anticipate management decisions and to adopt improved fishing gears, i. e. with reduced discarding and reduced environmental impact. A pro-active attitude and a voluntary uptake of improved gears allows the industry to shape the alterations to the specific conditions of the fishery and the fishing grounds. For the chain matrix <b>beam</b> <b>trawl,</b> many studies {{have been carried out}} {{on a wide variety of}} technical alterations to the <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> to improve the length and species selectivity, to reduce ecosystem effects and to reduce fuel consumption. The ILVO-Fishery institute has carried out many of these experiments and has recently been testing and promoting a combination of successful alterations. The improved trawl has been called the “alternative beam trawl” and has already been commercially tested for two years on a beam trawler. It consists of a number of simple and cheap alterations to the <b>beam</b> <b>trawl.</b> This report is a compilation of the most successful technical alterations for the <b>beam</b> <b>trawl.</b> The alternative <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> is not strictly defined and can consist of any combination of selective devices presented in this report or even new devices that prove to be successful.

40|$|Since the 1980 s, shrimp beam {{trawling}} has flourished in inshore {{waters of the}} East China Sea (ECS) off Zhejiang Province. By 2000, {{there were more than}} 10 000 beam trawlers operating in the area. The fishery targets several species of shrimp, including Parapenaeopsis hardwickii, Solenocera crassicornis, Parapenaeus fissuroides, and Trachypenaeus curvirostris. In the early 1990 s, electrical <b>beam</b> <b>trawls</b> using pulse generators, powered either from the vessel or from underwater battery packs, became popular in the fishery. As a result of this new technology, the catch rates of shrimp, especially the burrowing shrimp species, increased. At its peak usage, there were more than 3000 vessels using electrical <b>beam</b> <b>trawls</b> in Zhejiang Province and another 500 or more in the adjacent pro-vinces of Jiangsu and Fujian. This technology was also widespread along the Chinese coast, but a lack of regulation resulted in the misuse of electrical pulse parameters that caused damage to juvenile shrimps and other benthic species. In 2001, this fishing method was banned from the waters off Zhejiang Province, and subsequently {{in other parts of the}} ECS.

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the changes in}} the Dutch demersal fishing fleet since the 1950 s revealed that competitive interactions among vessels and gear types within the constraints imposed by biological, economic and fisheries management factors are the dominant processes governing the dynamics of fishing fleets. Double <b>beam</b> <b>trawling,</b> introduced in the early 1960 s, proved a successful fishing method to catch deep burying flatfish, in particular sole. In less than 10 years, the otter trawl fleet was replaced by a highly specialised <b>beam</b> <b>trawling</b> fleet, despite an initial doubling of the loss rate of vessels due to stability problems. Engine power, size of the <b>beam</b> <b>trawl,</b> number of tickler chains and fishing speed rapidly increased and fishing activities expanded into previously lightly fished grounds and seasons. Following the ban on flatfish trawling within the 12 nautical mile zone for vessels of more than 300 hp in 1975 and with the restriction of engine power to 2000 hp in 1987, the <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> fleet bifurcated. Changes in the fleet capacity were related to the economic results and showed a cyclic pattern with a period of 6 ¿ 7 years. The arms race between fishers was fuelled by competitive interactions among fishers: while the catchability of the fleet more than doubled in the ten years following the introduction of the <b>beam</b> <b>trawl,</b> a decline in catchability was observed in reference beam trawlers that remained the same. Vessel performance was not only affected by the technological characteristics but also by the number and characteristics of competing vessels...|$|R

The efficiency of the <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> fleet in 2004 was estimated, with parametric methods. To obtain the frontier form of production possibilities, we used the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) Technique. The evolution of efficiency was based in non-parametric methods namely the Malmquist Index, {{which is based on}} Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) techniques. The results indicated that the technical efficiency of the Portuguese <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> fleet was relatively low. It was observed that the output depends positively and significantly of the engine power and the number of days at sea. The results showed a slightly decrease in the total factors productivity. This is a symptom of some inefficiency of the artisanal fishing sector, which has a greater role in social terms than in the economic ones. Technical efficiency grew slightly between 1995 and 2004, whereas technological change decreased, indicating that the <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> fleet had technological losses during the studied period. The conjugated effect of these two measures lead to a small decrease of the total factors productivity.

40|$|Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole and Norway lobster are 7 main {{target species}} of the {{demersal}} mixed fisheries in the North Sea, Skagerrak and Eastern Channel. Gadoids and Norway lobsters are mainly taken in the nor-thern North Sea by towed gears except <b>beam</b> <b>trawls</b> while the flatfish fisheries are conducted in the southern North Sea mainly using <b>beam</b> <b>trawls.</b> Recently, the central North Sea appears less fished by demersal gears. Towed nets including seines and <b>beam</b> <b>trawls</b> equipped with meshes of more than 100 mm resp. more than 80 mm were identified as the main gears effecting the depleted cod and reduced plaice stocks. The saithe sector, using towed nets with meshes of more than 110 mm, longlines, gill nets and others, appears to affect the 7 species to a lesser extend. These results support the interim effort limitations by gear types, vessel and month as enforced by the European Commission since 2003. TAC regulations alone are considered inefficient to sustainably harvest stocks by mixed fisheries. A fleet-effort management method is developed estimating the fleets’ effects based on the sum of partial exploitation rates of the species in mixed fisheries weighted by {{the ratio of the}} precautionary reference Bpa and the actual SSB size as ecological quality objective. Applying such fleet effort management could result in increased catch possibilities of some stocks by fleets selecting mainly few and non-overexploited stocks while respecting precautionary management constraints in minimum SSB or maximum exploitation rates at the same time...|$|E
40|$|Pulse {{trawling}} {{is used to}} {{a growing}} extent in the Dutch flatfish beam trawl fleet, and deemed as a promising alternative to tickler chain beam trawling. A comparative fishing experiment was carried out with one vessel using conventional <b>beam</b> <b>trawls,</b> {{and the other two}} using flatfish pulse trawls supplied by two different companies. Pulse trawl landings were lower both expressed in kg h- 1 (67 % based on auction data) or baskets per hectare (81 %). The pulse trawls had fewer fish discards (57 %, p < 0. 0001), including 62 % undersized plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L.) (p < 0. 0001), and 80 % discarded weight of benthic invertebrates (p = 0. 0198) per hectare. The pulse fishing technique resulted in a lower fuel consumption (37 – 49 %), and consequently in spite of lower landings net revenues were higher.

Rainfall is consistently high throughout the year (> 100 mm in each month) and the annual rainfall ranges from about 1, 800 to 2, 600 mm. Water temperatures ranged from 27 °C to 36 °C and salinity from 14 ‰ to 32 ‰ during this study. Fortnightly catches by <b>beam</b> <b>trawls</b> and bag nets were highly variable but showed a single broad period of postlarval and juvenile recruitment extending from December to May and an extended broad period of juvenile emigration from February to July.

Higher catches of postlarvae and juveniles were recorded at two sites in close proximity to small adjoining creeks than one with no adjacent creek. Catches of juveniles in bag nets were higher during the day than the night and were correlated with the strength of the water flow. Environmental variables generally accounted for only a small proportion of the variation in catches, even for rainfall. The small proportion of variation explained by environmental variables is probably because of their relatively small seasonal variation in the Matang region.
