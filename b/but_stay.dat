5|$|If the ionic {{compound}} is soluble in a solvent, it can {{be obtained}} as a solid compound by evaporating the solvent from this electrolyte solution. As the solvent is evaporated, the ions do not go into the vapour, <b>but</b> <b>stay</b> in the remaining solution, and when they become sufficiently concentrated, nucleation occurs, and they crystallize into an ionic compound. This process occurs widely in nature, and is the means of formation of the evaporite minerals. Another method of recovering the compound from solution involves saturating a solution at high temperature and then reducing the solubility by reducing the temperature until the solution is supersaturated and the solid compound nucleates.|$|E

25|$|In 1967, the Tanzanian {{government}} {{declared the}} Ujamaa policy, that set Tanzania into a socialist path. The move slowed down the potential {{growth of the}} city as the government encouraged people not to move in cities <b>but</b> <b>stay</b> in Ujamaa socialist villages. But by 1980's the Ujamaa policy proved to be a failure into combating increasing poverty, hunger, and delayed development that Tanzania faced. This led to the 1980s liberalization policy that virtually ended socialism and its spirit within the Tanzania's government. The move led to increasing migration of rural dwellers from rural areas into cities with Dar es Salaam becoming the leading city in receiving migrants from rural areas.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} the mobilization in his {{area of responsibility}} and stopping the German advances into Troms, Colonel Løken was in overall command of the early counter-attacks carried out in late April 1940 by the 6th Brigade against the German forces in the Gratangen area. During this time, Løken first had his headquarters at Kroken in Salangsdalen in Troms, before it moved forward to Fossbakken in Lavangen. Løken personally commanded the central axis of the failed first Norwegian advance at Gratangen. During the attack the 6th Brigade greatly outnumbered the German defenders, with two infantry battalions with artillery support mounting a direct attack against the German positions on Lapphaugen, while another two battalions made a flank march {{to cut off the}} defenders. The frontal attack failed after Løken had hesitated in attacking and sent his units against strong German positions in a disorganized and uncoordinated manner. While the main attack failed, the flank march of the 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment was counter-attacked by the Germans, the Norwegians suffering heavy losses and being routed. After the failed initial offensive, Løken severely criticized the commander of the 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, Major Nils Christoffer Bøckman, for having bypassed Løken's brigade command in order to receive permission to advance directly from the 6th Division, exposing his unit to counter-attack. Løken's orders to the battalion had been to under no circumstance move down into the Gratangen valley, <b>but</b> <b>stay</b> on defensible ground.|$|E

In her comments in the Letters, Bosse described with loyalty and affection Strindberg's protectiveness and his efforts to bring his young wife with him along his own spiritual paths; nevertheless, she chafed under these efforts, pointing out that she herself, at 22, was not even remotely finished with this world. Increasingly agoraphobic, Strindberg attempted to overcome his anxieties and allow his young wife the summer excursions she longed for. He planned sunny drives in hired victorias, but often the mystical [...] "Powers" [...] which governed him intervened.

500|$|Edmonton's {{championship}} run {{came to an}} end in 1983 {{when they}} failed to reach the final; the Argonauts defeated the BC Lions to win the championship. Despite Toronto's win, the CFL felt that the overall quality of play in the East Division had deteriorated compared to that of the West. [...] In 1986, it altered the playoff format to allow the first non-playoff team in one division to take the last playoff spot, <b>but</b> <b>stay</b> in their division if they had a better record. [...] The consequences of the new rules were felt immediately, as the league gave a playoff spot to the Stampeders having a better record than the Alouettes, and decided the East Division Final would be a 2-game-total-point Final between the Toronto Argonauts and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, who finished first and second, respectively. [...] The crossover, if necessary, would begin in 1987. [...] In financial difficulty, the loss of the playoff spot was disastrous for Montreal, which ceased operations one year later. [...] Reduced to eight teams, the CFL shifted Winnipeg to the East Division, making the 1988 Grey Cup between the Blue Bombers and Lions the first championship game between two western Canadian teams.|$|E
500|$|The phrase [...] "baptized in the Holy Spirit" [...] occurs {{two times}} in Acts of the Apostles, first in Acts 1:4–5 and second in Acts 11:16.

[...] "Baptized in the Spirit" [...] indicates an outward immersion into {{the reality of the}} Holy Spirit, while [...] "filled with the Spirit" [...] suggests an internal diffusion. Both terms speak to the totality of receiving the Spirit. [...] The baptism with the Holy Spirit is described in various places as the Spirit [...] "poured out upon", [...] "falling upon", [...] "coming upon" [...] people. To [...] "pour out" [...] suggests abundance and reflects John 3:34, [...] "God gives the Spirit without limit". Another expression, [...] "come upon" [...] is related to a statement by Jesus in Luke 24:49, [...] "I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. <b>But</b> <b>stay</b> in the city until you are clothed with power from on high".

500|$|In another Rolling Stone interview, {{the band}} {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} the title track, saying that is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged.

[...] In another interview discussion about [...] "Lights and Sounds", Key noted that it is [...] "about a band like us coming into a career that we didn't think we'd have. You find yourself surrounded by a lot of false people, {{a lot of people who}} are not doing it for the same reasons you are. That song is about the struggle of not giving in to that." [...] The band explained that the lyrics, [...] "Make it new <b>but</b> <b>stay</b> in the lines / Just let go but keep it inside / Smile big for everyone / Even when you know what they've done / They gave you the end but not where to start / Not how to build, how to tear it apart", were written because of that particular reason. Key also revealed that the lyrics, [...] "They gave you the end / But not where to start / Not how to build / But how to tear it apart", were references to bands Nofx and Bad Religion. Key also explained that when he was preoccupied by distractions, in which he referred to them as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album and track title just that. Key also revealed that it was because that is how it surrounded the band, when working on the album.|$|E

[...] Scott Sexton of About.com lauded the duet version of the song, writing [...] "As of now anything Reba touches turns to gold, but with this hit alone she has a great shot at platinum." [...] Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe praised McEntire's beautiful singing although he said that she did not bring [...] "anything new" [...] to the song. He also added that the song [...] "had the potential to be reworked into an interesting mother/daughter confrontation" [...] but he was disappointed because McEntire did not change the viewpoints of the song. He graded the production of the song as [...] "C-", writing [...] "The end result is the song doesn’t make any sense, and is just confusing to listen to." [...] Thom Jurek of Allmusic criticized the instrumentation of the song, saying [...] "This could have been a Meat Loaf reject from [...]" [...] Gayle Thompson of The Boot ranked [...] "Because of You" [...] at number ten in her list of [...] "Top 20 Reba McEntire songs."

500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could make our own version <b>but</b> <b>stay</b> very true to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day?

2500|$|Here, the {{required}} default method of handling exceptions according to IEEE 754 is discussed (the IEEE-754 optional trapping and other [...] "alternate exception handling" [...] modes are not discussed).

That they are [...] "sticky" [...] means {{that they are not}} reset by the next (arithmetic) operation, <b>but</b> <b>stay</b> set until explicitly reset. The use of [...] "sticky" [...] flags thus allows for testing of exceptional conditions to be delayed until after a full floating-point expression or subroutine: without them exceptional conditions that could not be otherwise ignored would require explicit testing immediately after every floating-point operation.

For instance, 1/0 returns +∞, while also setting the divide-by-zero flag bit (this default of ∞ is designed so as to often return a finite result when used in subsequent operations and so be safely ignored).|$|E

2500|$|As {{discussed}} above, {{this is a}} much-disputed area. Much {{has been}} made—particularly by Calvin Hoffman—of so-called [...] "parallelisms" [...] between the two authors.
