A L-lysine {{modified}} semi-crosslinked chitosan (LMCCT) beads was synthesized {{and demonstrated}} {{to be an}} excellent <b>enzyme</b> <b>support</b> by studying the enzymatic properties of glucose oxidases (GODs) immobilized on it.

The insertion of the flexible L-lysine spacers between chitosan backbone and the active amino groups increases the activity of immobilized GODs (I-GODs) and improves the affinity of I-GODs towards the substrate, which was testified by the smaller Michaealis constant, Km and larger reactive rate, Vm of I-GODs on LMCCT than that on crosslinked chitosan.

Characterization revealed a typical homotetrameric catalase with one pentacoordinated heme b per subunit (Tyr 340 being the axial ligand), albeit in two orientations, and a very fast catalatic turnover rate (kcat[*]=[*] 339, 000 s− 1).
