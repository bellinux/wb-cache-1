50|$|Hacker {{meets the}} Chief Scientific Advisor, who {{questions}} the PM’s {{belief in the}} nuclear deterrent. By using several scenarios, he convinces Hacker that the chances of him actually deciding to launch a nuclear strike are remote, as Britain’s proximity to other European countries would render such an attack suicidal. However, the Advisor does {{make the case for}} the United States and Russia, and recommends that the UK keeps its Polaris missile system just in case. In the meantime, he suggests cancelling the Trident missiles and spending £15 billion on conventional forces instead. Hacker goes further: he decides not to <b>buy</b> <b>Cruise</b> missiles from the US either and to re-introduce conscription. He therefore hopes to solve Britain’s defence, educational, and unemployment problems at a stroke.|$|R

60|$|Mid-June came; {{the stream}} of cars was almost a solid parade; the Portygee maid brought the news that there were summer {{boarders}} at the Nickerson farm-house; and the Applebys, {{when they were in}} Grimsby Center <b>buying</b> <b>butter</b> and bread, saw the rocking-chair brigade mobilizing on the long white porches of the Old Harbor Inn.|$|R
50|$|Witney Market {{began in}} the Middle Ages. Thursday is the {{traditional}} market day {{but there is also}} a market on Saturday. The buttercross in the market square is so called because people from neighbouring towns would gather there to <b>buy</b> <b>butter</b> and eggs. It was built in about 1600 and its clock was added in 1683.|$|R
30|$|Firstly, spatial {{transmission}} effects between World and EU butter {{prices are}} analysed, given the recent greater market {{orientation of the}} CAP. The underlying economic justification for this analysis is spatial arbitrage (Listori and Esposti 2012). For the case of butter markets, this means that when World prices rises, arbitrageurs will start to <b>buy</b> <b>butter</b> in the EU and sell on the World market. 11 This will, in turn, increase EU prices.|$|R

[...] "You {{know that at}} present these shares are {{scarcely}} saleable except at a ruinous discount, {{and it would be}} a pity to part with them just now, seeing that there is some hope of improvement at this time. There is nothing for it but to sell my estate, and I don't think there will be enough left to <b>buy</b> <b>butter</b> to my bread after this unhappy affair is settled, for it amounts to some thousands of pounds." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{administering}} this {{educational structure}} that includes on-water and written testing, ASA certifications are now recognized at charter companies and maritime employers {{all around the}} world. They have published textbooks for beginners, coastal cruising sailors, bareboat charterers and those looking to <b>buy</b> or charter <b>cruising</b> catamarans. In addition to textbooks, ASA has produced educational videos, smart-phone apps and most recently an interactive digital game that aims to teach and drill rudimentary sailing skills while off the water.|$|R
40|$|A survey among 246 people {{belonging}} to 14 {{ethnic groups and}} living in 5 different parklands in Benin revealed different practices to process shea kernels (namely boiling followed sun drying and smoking) and extract shea butter. A relation between parklands, gathering period, and sun-drying conditions was established. Moisture content and appearance of kernels were the selection criteria for users of shea kernels; color was the main characteristic to <b>buy</b> <b>butter.</b> Constraints to be solved are long processing times, lack of milling equipment and high water requirements. Best practices for smoking, sun drying, and roasting operations need to be established for further improvement...|$|R
50|$|Denmark {{instituted a}} soft drink tax in the 1930s (it {{amounted}} to 1.64 Danish krone per liter), but announced in 2013 {{that they were}} going to abolish it along with an equally unpopular fat tax, with the goal of creating jobs and helping the local economy. Critics claimed that the taxes were notably ineffective; to avoid the fat and sugar taxes, local retailers had complained that Danes simply went to Sweden and Germany, where prices were lower to <b>buy</b> <b>butter,</b> ice cream and soda. Denmark repealed the fat tax in January 2013 and repealed the tax on soft drinks in 2014.|$|R

Recently my {{profitability}} has positively {{been influenced by the}} information I gained from a fellow member who lives in a house next to mine. She frequently travels to north Shoa to <b>buy</b> <b>butter.</b> Looking at how she was benefiting I asked her if she was willing to search for me any feasible market in north Shoa that I could make profits better than here. Afterward she searched and recommended me to buy garlic from there and sell it in Merkato. I never used to go out of Addis for trading purpose. Thanks to that lady; I am making profits”.|$|R
5000|$|The butter lamb, {{also known}} as a buttered lamb, is a {{traditional}} butter sculpture accompanying the Easter meal for many Russian, Slovenian and Polish Catholics. Butter is shaped into a lamb either by hand or in a lamb-shaped mold. [...] It is also sold at delis, Polish specialty markets, and some general grocery stores at Easter time. The butter lamb is a particular tradition in Buffalo, New York's Broadway Market thanks to Malczewski's Butter Lambs who has kept the Polish tradition alive for decades. Many people flock to the famous Broadway market to <b>buy</b> <b>butter</b> lambs as an annual event signifying the start of Easter and spring.|$|R
5000|$|As Fula in Yaya Diallo’s family, they breed {{cattle and}} sheep. They were always moving, {{looking for some}} good place where the animals could get good grass and water; {{where there were no}} harmful insects that could give {{infectious}} diseases to the cattle. They built temporary huts near a village. Women go to the village to sell or trade dairy products like milk and <b>butter</b> and to <b>buy</b> the ingredients for food: rice, fish, and flour. They cooked and slept in the temporary huts. During the day, Yaya Diallo herded animals in order to feed them. He had to follow the rhythm of the animals; that is a good school for patience.|$|R
50|$|Before Polson dairy was started, housewives in India used to <b>buy</b> <b>butter</b> {{and milk}} from the milkmen directly. First, when Polson dairy started out, {{it had to}} employ non-Indian staff initially. During World War I it {{supplied}} Polson Butter and Polson's Pure coffee to British Indian and American forces. At its peak, it was producing up to 5 tons of butter every day and {{to meet the demands}} of the forces as a result of which a new factory office was started in Bombay. Polson was known to let its cream sour for a few days and that stale cream was then heavily salted and processed to make butter. This is the reason why a rival brand Amul's butter made of fresh cream flopped in the market because consumers were too used to Polson's taste.|$|R
60|$|I mention these lower things, because I would suit {{my writing}} to the {{understanding}} of the meanest people, and speak of frauds used in the most ordinary trades; but it is the like in almost all the goods a tradesman can deal in. If you go to Warwickshire to buy cheese, you demand the cheese 'of the first make,' because that is the best. If you go to Suffolk to <b>buy</b> <b>butter,</b> you refuse the butter of the first make, because that is not the best, but you bargain for 'the right rowing butter,' which is the butter that is made when the cows are turned into the grounds where the grass has been mowed, and the hay carried off, and grown again: and so in many other cases. These things demonstrate the advantages there are to a tradesman, in his being thoroughly informed of the terms of art, and the peculiarities belonging to every particular business, which, therefore, I call the language of trade.|$|R
40|$|Data mining is the {{discovery}} of previously unknown, potentially useful and hidden knowledge in databases. In this paper, we concentrate on {{the discovery}} of association rules. Many algorithms have been proposed to #nd association rules in databases with binary attributes. Weintroduce the fuzzy association rules of the form, 'If X is A then Y is B', to deal with quantitative attributes. X, Y are set of attributes and A, B are fuzzy sets which describe X and Y respectively. Using the fuzzy set concept, the discovered rules are more understandable to human. Moreover, fuzzy sets handle numerical values better than existing methods because fuzzy sets soften the e#ect of sharp boundaries. 1 Introduction During the past years, boolean association rule mining has received considerable attention. Boolean association rule mining tries to #nd consumer behavior in retail data. The discovered rule can tell, for example, people <b>buy</b> <b>butter</b> and milk will also buy bread. Such rules {{can be used in}} cust [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} research analyzes {{a segment}} of the leisure and hospitality sector in Croatia and Slovenia. Specifically, we examine the perceptions of travel agents regarding vacation alternatives in general and cruising in particular. The paper presents a literature review of the cruise industry, then describes three issues: travel agents as a channel of distribution, the <b>cruise</b> <b>buying</b> process, and outbound tourism in Slovenia and Croatia. The two markets we examine represent two levels of economic development and tourism market maturity in Central Europe. Data have been collected using MBA student teams from the United States and Italy posing as mystery shoppers, looking for travel destinations and cruises as an option. A total of 57 Croatian agencies and 29 Slovenian agencies were examined. Final results are tied to the literature review and conclusions are drawn about the potential opportunities and threats in the market...|$|R
40|$|About the book: Cyberspace {{opens up}} {{infinitely}} new possibilities to the deviant imagination. With {{access to the}} Internet and sufficient know-how you can, if you are so inclined, <b>buy</b> a bride, <b>cruise</b> gay bars, go on a global shopping spree with someone else's credit card, break into a bank's security system, plan a demonstration in another country and hack into the Pentagon [...] {{all on the same}} day. In more than any other medium, time and place are transcended, undermining the traditional relationship between physical context and social situation. This book crosses the boundaries of sociological, criminological and cultural discourse in order to explore the implications of these massive transformations in information and communication technologies for the growth of criminal and deviant identities and behaviour on the Internet. This is a book not about computers, nor about legal controversies over the regulation of cyberspace, but about people and the new patterns of human identity, behaviour and association that are emerging {{as a result of the}} communications revolution...|$|R

[...] "Ye see, David, he that was all his life so great a man, and come of the blood and bearing the name of kings, is now brought down to live in a French town like a poor and private person. He that had four hundred swords at his whistle, I have seen, with these eyes of mine, <b>buying</b> <b>butter</b> in the market-place, and taking it home in a kale-leaf. This is not only a pain but a disgrace to us of his family and clan. There are the bairns forby, the children and the hope of Appin, that must be learned their letters and how to hold a sword, in that far country. Now, the tenants of Appin have to pay a rent to King George; but their hearts are staunch, they are true to their chief; and what with love and a bit of pressure, and maybe a threat or two, the poor folk scrape up a second rent for Ardshiel. Well, David, I'm the hand that carries it." [...] And he struck the belt about his body, so that the guineas rang.|$|R
40|$|Speaking to Welsh farmers, Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler {{claimed that}} dairy-sector reforms {{would provide a}} stable {{perspective}} by prolonging the quota system until the 2014 / 15 campaign. He pointed out that price cuts would be greatest for butter and skimmed milk powder where surpluses are greatest and the market is declining, and that this would bring the sector {{more in tune with}} market realities. The current round of reforms are designed to bring the dairy regime under the single farm payment scheme by 2008, although member states may introduce reforms earlier if they so wish. Speaking later in the month to Irish farmers, Commissioner Fischler explicitly justified the price cuts introduced for butter and milk powder by arguing that 'too much money is spent on <b>buying</b> <b>butter</b> into intervention each year, and if there isn't the market for it then we shouldn't produce it'. He pointed out that Ireland as the lowest cost producer in Europe was well placed to 'diversify into fresh and value-added dairy products for which the market is growing' He argued that the compensation offered along with the price cuts will give Irish farmers 'the chance to adapt to current market realities'. Comment: It {{should be noted that the}} objective of the price cuts is not to reduce production (since milk production is controlled by the quota regime) rather the aim is to allow markets to be cleared more easily by expanding domestic demand for butter and milk powder and allowing exports to be increased without breaching WTO limits on export refunds. This is likely to increase EU dairy exports and reverse the recent declines in the EU's share of the global dairy market. Speaking to Welsh farmers, Agriculture Commissioner Franz [...] ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the year}} 1709, Susanna Johnson, {{daughter}} to one Captain Johnson, {{who lived at}} a place adjacent to Rumford, in Essex, going one morning to that town to <b>buy</b> <b>butter</b> at the market, was met there by an old miserable looking woman, {{just as she had}} taken some of her change of the marketwoman, in copper, and this old woman rather demanded than begged the gentlewoman to give her a penny. Miss Johnson reputing her {{to be one of those}} hateful people that are called sturdy beggars, refused it her, as thinking it to be no act of charity, and that it would be rather gratifying and indulging her impudence, than supplying or satisfying her indigence. Upon the refusal, the old hag, with a face more wrinkled still, if possible, by anger, than it was by age, took upon her to storm at young Miss Johnson very loudly, and to threaten and menace her; but when she found her common threats and menaces were of no avail, she swore she would be revenged of the young creature in so signal a manner, that she should repent the denial of that penny from her heart before she got home, and that it should cost her many pounds to get rid of the consequences of that denial and her anger. The poor innocent girl despised these last words likewise, and, getting up on horseback, returned homewards; but just as she got about half way, her horse stopped, and no means that she could use would make him advance one single step; but she stayed awhile, to see if that would humour him to go on. At last the beast began to grow unruly, and snorted and trembled as if he had seen or smelt something that frightened him, and so fell a kicking desperately, till he threw the girl from the saddle, not being able to cling to it any longer, though a pretty good horsewoman of her years; so much were the horse's motions and plungings more than ordinarily violent.|$|R
60|$|He {{rose from}} the chair where he had sat looking up into her pictured face, and went to open the safe near the window. But he stopped in stooping over to work the combination, and glanced out across his {{shoulder}} into the night. The familiar beauty of the scene tempted him to the window for what, all at once, he felt might be his last look, though the next instant {{he was able to}} argue the feeling down, and make his meditated act work into his schemes of early retrieval and honorable return. He must have been thinking there before the fire a long time, for now the moon had risen, and shone upon the black bulk of firs to the southward, and on the group of outbuildings. These were in a sort the mechanism that transacted the life of his house, ministering to all its necessities and pleasures. Under the conservatories, with their long stretches of glass, catching the moon's rays like levels of water, was the steam furnace that imparted their summer climate, through heavy mains carried below the basement, to every chamber of the mansion; a ragged plume of vapor escaped from the tall chimney above them, and dishevelled itself in diaphanous silver on the night-breeze. Beyond the hot-houses lay the cold graperies; and off to the left rose the stables; in a cosy nook of this low mass Northwick saw the lights of the coachman's family-rooms; beyond the stables were the cow-barn and the dairy, with the farmer's cottage; it was a sort of joke with Northwick's business friends that you could <b>buy</b> <b>butter</b> of him sometimes at less than half it cost him, and the joke flattered Northwick's sense of baronial consequence with regard to his place. It was really a farm in extent, and it was mostly a grazing farm; his cattle were in the herd-books, and he raised horses, which he would sell now and then to a friend; they were so distinctly varied from the original stock as to form almost a breed of themselves; they numbered scores in his stalls and pastures. The whole group of the buildings was so great that it was like a sort of communal village. In the silent moonlight Northwick looked at {{it as if it were}} an expansion or extension of himself, so personally did it seem to represent his tastes, and so historical was it of the ambitions of his whole life; he realized that it would be like literally tearing himself from it, when he should leave it. That would be the real pang; his children could come to him, but not his home. But he reminded himself that he was going only for a time, until he could rehabilitate himself, and come back upon the terms he could easily make when once he was on his feet again. He thought how fortunate it was that in the meanwhile this property could not be alienated; how fortunate it was that he had originally deeded it to his wife in the days when he had the full right to do so, and she had willed it to their children by a perfect entail. The horses and the cattle might go, and probably must go; and he winced to think of it, but the land, and the house,--all but the furniture and pictures,--were the children's and could not be touched. The pictures were his, and would have to go with the horses and cattle; but ten or twelve thousand dollars would replace them, and he must add that sum to his other losses, and bear it as well as he could.|$|R
