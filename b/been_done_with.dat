5|$|Progress M1-5, {{which had}} {{originally}} been built to resupply and refuel either Mir or the International Space Station, was selected to perform the deorbit manoeuvre. Its mission earned it the nickname Hearse. It was a Progress-M1 11F615A55 spacecraft, with the serial number 254. An uninhabited area of the southern Pacific Ocean was selected for the station to be deorbited into, as had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> five earlier Salyut spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|After {{their work}} with Black Uhuru and that group's line-up change, Sly and Robbie pursued more {{international}} music endeavors. They branched out into cross-genre experiments with a conceptual, ensemble-oriented approach, while developing a mentorship with record producer Bill Laswell, whom they met through Blackwell and by working on Mick Jagger's 1985 album She's the Boss. In 1985, they collaborated with Laswell on their album Language Barrier, which had guest contributions from Herbie Hancock, Bob Dylan, Afrika Bambaataa, and Manu DiBango. Its recording developed from a track the duo had revisited from their work on the soundtrack to the 1983 film Never Say Never Again. The track had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> electronic drums at Compass Point Studios, but scrapped as a rhythm track for later use.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} released in Japan on April 27, 1990. It {{had not been}} released outside Japan until a remake was developed by Matrix Software for the Nintendo DS on August 24, 2006. At that time, {{it was the only}} Final Fantasy game not previously released in North America or Europe. There had been earlier plans to remake the game for Bandai's WonderSwan Color handheld, as had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the first, second, and fourth installments of the series, but the game faced several delays and was eventually canceled after the premature cancellation of the platform. The Nintendo DS version of the game was positively received, selling over one million copies in Japan.|$|E
40|$|This is {{a report}} on {{personal}} experiences with 549 cases of popliteal and tibial artery revascularization. There were 204 cases of femoral-popliteal artery by-pass procedures utilizing vein grafts. In 193 cases, this procedure <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> autogenous greater saphenous vein grafts. The remainder of the cases consisted of arm veins, bank veins and superficial femoral veins. There were 149 femoral-tibial or popliteal-tibial artery bypasses utilizing vein grafts or composite grafts. In 83 cases, tibial artery bypasses <b>were</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> autogenous greater saphenous vein grafts. In 30 cases, popliteal-tibial artery bypasses <b>were</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> autoge-nous greater saphenous vein grafts.

5|$|The other {{possibility}} for Black {{is to keep}} his Bb4 as long as possible, exchanging it against the white knight only in favourable circumstances. A couple of attempts have <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> this in mind, with subtle variations along the moves a7–a5, b7–b6 and d7–d6. Against the mundane 10...d6 White can continue with 11.Nb3 (see diagram at right) {{to play on the}} queenside against the exposed Bb4, or 11.Nb1 to recycle the knight on the ideal d5-square. Another idea is the immediate 10...a5, to have the d6-square for the bishop, inhibit the b2–b4 push and have the possible a5–a4 pawn advance if the white knight moves to b3. In the game Mikhalevski–Chabanon (Bad Endbach 1995) Black kept the bishop with 11.Nb3 a4 12.a3Bd6 13.Nd4 Bc5 14.Nb5 d6 15.Nc3 Ng6 16.Bg3 f5 and had dynamic play.|$|E
5|$|Babakotia radofilai and {{all other}} sloth lemurs share many traits with living sloths, demonstrating {{convergent}} evolution. It had long forearms, curved digits, and highly mobile hip and ankle joints. Its skull was more heavily built than that of indriids, {{but not as much}} as in the larger sloth lemurs. Its dentition is similar to that of all other indriids and sloth lemurs. It lived in the northern part of Madagascar and shared its range with at least two other sloth lemur species, Palaeopropithecus ingens and Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion. Babakotia radofilai was primarily a leaf-eater (folivore), though it also ate fruit and hard seeds. It is known only from subfossil remains and may have died out shortly after the arrival of humans on the island, but not enough radiocarbon dating has <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> this species to know for certain.|$|E
5|$|It was objected yesterday, {{that there}} was no {{provision}} for a jury from the vicinage. If it could have <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> safety, {{it would not have been}} opposed. It might so happen that a trial would be impracticable in the county. Suppose a rebellion in a whole district, would it not be impossible to get a jury? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America. There are deviations of it in England: yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence, than have taken place there for a long time, though it be left to the legislative discretion. It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from, yet in some cases it is necessary. It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances. This is a complete and satisfactory answer.|$|E
40|$|Aim:-The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of instrument design on inducing root fracture. Methodology:- 60 single rooted premolars extracted for orthodontic reasons were collected. Periapical radiographs were taken from the proximal view to eliminate any teeth with double canal morphology. Each specimen was decoronated 2 mm coronal to cementoenamel junction with the help of diamond disc Specimens were divided into 6 groups of 10 teeth each and instrumentation <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> files of different designs by Crown-down technique. Group 1 -Instrumentation <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> stainless steel K hand files Group 2 -Instrumentation <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> stainless steel H hand files.

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} birth, John was passed from Eleanor into {{the care of}} a wet nurse, a {{traditional}} practice for medieval noble families. Eleanor then left for Poitiers, the capital of Aquitaine, and sent John and his sister Joan north to Fontevrault Abbey. This may have <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the aim of steering her youngest son, with no obvious inheritance, towards a future ecclesiastical career. Eleanor spent the next few years conspiring against her husband Henry and neither parent played a part in John's very early life. John was probably, like his brothers, assigned a magister whilst he was at Fontevrault, a teacher charged with his early education and with managing the servants of his immediate household; John was later taught by Ranulf de Glanvill, a leading English administrator. John spent some time {{as a member of the}} household of his eldest living brother Henry the Young King, where he probably received instruction in hunting and military skills.|$|E

25|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939 put an early {{end to the}} beginnings of self-government in Gibraltar. Gibraltar's strategic geographical position {{and the threat of}} bombing raids by the Axis powers led to the evacuation of the civilian population. Many were evacuated first to Morocco and later to the United Kingdom, others were taken to the Portuguese island of Madeira or the British colony of Jamaica. The evacuation led to conflicting emotions; on the one hand the experience of the Blitz strengthened British ties, whilst prejudice and racism encountered in the United Kingdom reinforced the sense of Gibraltarian identity. Spanish neutrality ensured Gibraltar was never the subject of a serious military threat but it led to the suspicion among evacuees that a deal had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the Fascist Dictator General Franco to return Gibraltar to Spain after the conflict.|$|E
