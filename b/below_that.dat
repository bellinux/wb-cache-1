5|$|In {{fish and}} other wildlife, {{selenium}} is necessary for life, but toxic in high doses. For salmon, the optimal concentration of selenium is about 1 microgram selenium per gram of whole body weight. Much <b>below</b> <b>that</b> level, young salmon die from deficiency; much above, they die from toxic excess.|$|E

This was slightly above {{the average for}} Great Britain but <b>below</b> <b>that</b> of the South West region which was at 10.7% for that period. The sector is the county's fourth largest employer, but a predicted decline suggests there will be 10,200 fewer jobs in manufacturing by 2026.|$|E

The border of the window contains portrait busts of notable American Revolution-era Philadelphians: John Bartram, George Clymer, Robert Morris, David Rittenhouse, Benjamin Rush, and James Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} actinide metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide curium, to the left of the actinide californium and below the lanthanide terbium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 14.78g/cm3 lies between those of curium (13.52g/cm3) and californium (15.1g/cm3), as does its melting point of 986°C, <b>below</b> <b>that</b> of curium (1340°C) but higher than that of californium (900°C). Berkelium is relatively soft and has one of the lowest bulk moduli among the actinides, at about 20 GPa (2Pa).|$|E

5|$|Clare {{maintained}} {{roughly the}} same intensity as its track became more southerly. At 1600 UTC on 9 January the storm made landfall at Pilbara {{to the west of}} Dampier. Heading ashore, the storm began to quickly deteriorate, and both the JTWC and the BoM declared it dissipated on 10 January as it continued southward. Throughout the storm's course, the JTWC's intensity estimates were <b>below</b> <b>that</b> of the BoM. Also, it is reported that the cyclone's presentation on satellite was not representative of its actual intensity.|$|E
5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced <b>below</b> <b>that</b> {{of any of the}} tissues, there is a tendency for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas. This is known as out-gassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure reduces the partial pressure of the inert gas in the lungs. This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles, and the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E
5|$|Like many Australian languages, Wagiman {{does not}} categorially {{distinguish}} nouns from adjectives. These form one word class {{that is called}} nominals. Wagiman nominals take case suffixes (see <b>below)</b> <b>that</b> denote their grammatical or semantic role in the sentence. The grammatical cases are ergative and absolutive, and the semantic cases include instrumental (using), allative (towards), ablative (from), locative (at), comitative (with, having), privative (without, lacking), temporal (at the time of) and semblative (resembling). The dative case can be either grammatical or semantic, depending on the syntactic requirements of the verb.|$|E

At July2014, Eagle Boys was the third largest pizza chain in Australia, with 12% share of Australia's pizza market.

5|$|Racial {{and ethnic}} {{minorities}} lag behind white counterparts in education, with 15.0% {{of blacks and}} 13.0% of Hispanics holding bachelor's degrees compared to 42.0% of the white population. The standard of living is on the rise, with incomes {{among the highest in}} the Midwest, but median household income among minorities is <b>below</b> <b>that</b> of whites by over $17,000. Regionally, home ownership among minority residents is half that of whites though Asian home ownership has doubled. In 2000, the poverty rate for whites was 4.2%; for blacks it was 26.2%; for Asians, 19.1%; Native Americans, 23.2%; and Hispanics, 18.1%.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the Soviet {{and native}} Stalinists was {{widespread}} among {{not only the}} general population but also the PZPR ranks, which limited the oppressive system's damage in Poland to well <b>below</b> <b>that</b> of other European communist-ruled countries. Political violence after 1947 was not widespread. The Church, subjected to partial property confiscations, remained largely intact, the marginalized to a considerable degree intelligentsia retained its potential to affect future reforms, the peasantry avoided wholesale collectivization and remnants of private enterprise survived. Gradual liberalizing changes took place between Stalin's death in 1953 and the Polish October of 1956.|$|E

The number of pupils eligible for free school meals is well above the national average. In the most recent OFSTED inspection, the nursery provision was praised for enabling children who enter the school with skills <b>below</b> <b>that</b> expected of similarly–aged children nationwide to achieve well through a stimulating and engaging curriculum and the nursery provision was good overall. The primary provision was praised for providing a safe and engaging learning environment in which children are able to progress to a level broadly comparable with children nationally and where pupils are extremely well behaved. In all inspection categories, the primary provision was judged good.|$|E

It is also found in some adult eutherian mammals, such as treeshrews, colugos, and rodents. The sublingua of treeshrews, close relatives of primates, is less developed than in lemuriforms and tarsiers, but suggests a phylogenetic relationship.|$|E
5|$|These games {{raised the}} profile of {{paraplegic}} (spinal cord and polio) athletes in Australia, particularly Western Australia. The spectator attendance amazed leading officials such as Dr Ludwig Guttmann, {{the founder of the}} Stoke Mandeville Games. He commented that the attendance was the best he had seen at any paraplegic sports event in the world. The Games highlighted the versatility of the athletes with many winning medals in different sports. It was noted that generally the standard of performance was <b>below</b> <b>that</b> of the Stoke Mandeville Games; however there were several outstanding performers including Vic Renalson, Bill Mather-Brown, Lorraine Dodd, M. Bazeley, Lynne Gilchrist and R. Scott who broke records in their events. A film of the Games was made.|$|E

In plants, growth is often in pulses, as in Spirogyra, peaks at a specific temperature, and <b>below</b> <b>that</b> value roughly doubles every 10 degrees Celsius. Tree growth varies cyclically with season (less strongly in evergreens), preserving a record of historic climates. Tadpole tails regenerate rapidly at first, slowing exponentially.|$|E
5|$|While Russia {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{consumers}} of alcohol per capita in the world, the use of non-traditional surrogate alcohols rapidly rose in the 2010s due to ongoing economic difficulties in Russia. With a price far <b>below</b> <b>that</b> of government-regulated vodka, surrogates reached an estimated height of twenty percent of the country's alcohol consumption by 2016. These products were often nearly pure alcohol that could be diluted to a rough approximation of vodka, and were frequently available at all hours via strategically placed vending machines. In the Irkutsk incident, the victims drank scented bath lotion that was mislabeled as containing drinkable ethanol.|$|E
