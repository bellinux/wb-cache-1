5|$|The {{interior}} sets of {{the boats}} were not built specifically for the programme, but were pulled together from stock items from various prop warehouses. Cumming had originally hoped to simulate the rocking of the ships by mounting the sets on rollers but the idea was dropped due to costs, with the effect achieved by moving the cameras instead. The photo of Tegan's Aunt Vanessa, one of the items created by Marriner from the contents of her mind, was shot specifically for the filming, requiring Dolore Whiteman (who had played the character in Logopolis) to be contracted for a one-day photoshoot. The models {{of the boats}}, used in the racing sequences, were props sourced by visual effects designer Mike Kelt following extensive research at the National Maritime Museum. The ships were mounted on rods for filming, while the oars were <b>battery</b> <b>operated.</b> The model of Davey's ship remained intact, with explosion being a filmed effect that was edited into the sequence.

25|$|The {{history of}} {{cortical}} stimulation mapping {{dates back to}} the late 19th century. Neurologists David Ferrier and Victor Horsley were some of the first to utilize this technique. Ferrier and Horsley employed CSM to further grasp the structure and function of the pre-Rolandic and post-Rolandic areas, also known as the pre central gyrus and post central gyrus. Prior to the development of more advanced methods, in 1888 C.B. Nancrede utilized a <b>battery</b> <b>operated</b> bipolar probe in order to map the motor cortex. In 1937, Wilder Penfield and Boldrey were able to show that stimulating the precentral gyrus elicited a response contralaterally; a significant finding given that it correlated to the anatomy based on which part of the brain was stimulated. In the early 1900s Charles Sherrington began to use monopolar stimulation in order to elicit a motor response. This technique allowed Sherrington to determine that the precentral gyrus (pre-Rolandic area) is a motor cortex and the postcentral gyrus (post-Rolandic area) is a sensory cortex. These findings, which were repeated by Harvey Cushing through the early 1900s, show that the Rolandic fissure is the point of separation between the motor and sensory cortices. Cushing's work with CSM moved it from an experimental technique to one that became a staple neurosurgery technique used to map the brain and treat epilepsy. Cushing took work that had previously been done on animals, specifically chimpanzees and orangutans, and was able to utilize cortical stimulation mapping to account for the differences between these species and humans. Cushing's work dramatically increased the effectiveness of the treatment utilizing cortical stimulation mapping, as neurosurgeons were now utilizing a more updated picture of the brain.|$|E
500|$|While Albert Gilbey was {{the main}} tenant {{of the house in}} the 1890s, the All England Croquet Championships were held in the grounds. Gilbey later became High Sheriff of Middlesex in 1912. The estate became {{significantly}} smaller following the disposal of [...] of the estate for development at an auction on 5 July 1922. Warren Road, Swakeleys Drive, Court Road, Milton Road, Ivy House Road, The Avenue and Thornhill Road (originally named Park Road) were constructed while other land bordering the River Pinn was designated as public open land. Humphrey John Talbot bought the house to avoid it being demolished and eventually sold it to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Sports Association in 1927, upon the condition he could remain as a tenant on the first floor. Swakeleys was requisitioned by the military during the Second World War when a searchlight <b>battery</b> <b>operated</b> within the grounds.

2500|$|Superheterodyne {{receivers}} {{require a}} local oscillator and mixer, combined in {{the function of}} a single pentagrid converter tube. Various alternatives such as {{using a combination of}} a triode with a hexode and even an octode have been used for this purpose. The additional grids include both control grids (at a low potential) and screen grids (at a high voltage). Many designs used such a screen grid as an additional anode to provide feedback for the oscillator function, whose current was added to that of the incoming radio frequency signal. The pentagrid converter thus became widely used in AM receivers including the miniature tube version of the [...] "All American Five".

Many just did not look quite right. Others, like the no. 1453 Citroën DS Présidentielle saloon were still impressive – flying French flags, with driver, and <b>battery</b> <b>operated</b> lights (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p.23). Some of the truck and construction models remained very clever as well, with many moving features, like the Bedford refuse truck or the Taylor Excavator.

[...] On the other hand, French Dinky Toys, which had to compete with Solido since 1957, were much more accurate with better paint and sharper details than their English counterparts. The no. 825 DUKW military truck is a good example of the quality of French Dinky Toys (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia).|$|E

2500|$|On December 4, 1970, {{the twisted}} nematic field effect in liquid {{crystals}} was filed for patent by Hoffmann-LaRoche in Switzerland, (...) with Wolfgang Helfrich and Martin Schadt (then {{working for the}} Central Research Laboratories) listed as inventors. Hoffmann-La Roche then licensed the invention to the Swiss manufacturer Brown, Boveri & Cie who produced displays for wristwatches during the 1970s and also to Japanese electronics industry, which soon produced the first digital quartz wrist watches with TN-LCDs and numerous other products. James Fergason, while working with Sardari Arora and Alfred Saupe at Kent State University Liquid Crystal Institute, filed an identical patent in the United States on April 22, 1971. In 1971 the company of Fergason ILIXCO (now LXD Incorporated) produced the first LCDs based on the TN-effect, which soon superseded the poor-quality DSM types due to improvements of lower operating voltages and lower power consumption. In 1972, the first active-matrix liquid-crystal display panel was produced in the United States by T. Peter Brody's team at Westinghouse, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1983, researchers at Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC), Switzerland, invented the super-twisted nematic (STN) structure for passive matrix addressed LCDs. H. Amstutz et al. were listed as inventors in the corresponding patent applications filed in Switzerland on July 7, 1983, and October 28, 1983. Patents were granted in Switzerland CH 665491, Europe EP 0131216, [...] and many more countries. In 1980 Brown Boveri started a 50/50 joint venture, Videlec AG, with the Dutch Philips company. Philips had all the required know how to design and build chips for the control of large LCD elements. In addition. Philips had better access to markets for electronic components and intended to use LCDs in new product generations of hi-fi, video equipment and telephones. In 1984 Philips researchers Theodorus Welzen and Adrianus de Vaan invented video speed [...] drive schemes that solved the slow response time of STN-LCDs, enabling high resolution, high quality, and smooth moving video images on STN-LCDs. In 1985 Philips inventors Theodorus Welzen and Adrianus de Vaan solved the problem to drive high-resolution STN-LCDs using low-voltage (CMOS-based) drive electronics; opening the application of high-quality (high resolution and video speed) LCD panels {{to be used in}} <b>battery</b> <b>operated</b> portable products like notebook computers and mobile phones. In 1985 Philips acquired 100% of the in Switzerland located Videlec AG company, after Philips moved the Videlec production lines to the Netherlands.
