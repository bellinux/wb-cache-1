5|$|Dynamic <b>braking</b> wastes <b>braking</b> {{energy by}} {{transforming}} it to heat. By contrast, regenerative drives recover <b>braking</b> energy by injecting this {{energy into the}} AC line. The capital cost of regenerative drives is, however, relatively high.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of a front suspension, {{especially}} telescoping fork tubes, the increase in downward force on the front wheel during <b>braking</b> may cause the suspension to compress and the front end to lower. This is known as brake diving. A riding technique that takes advantage of how <b>braking</b> increases the downward force on the front wheel is known as trail <b>braking.</b>|$|E
5|$|With a VFD, the {{stopping}} {{sequence is}} just the opposite as the starting sequence. The frequency and voltage applied to the motor are ramped down at a controlled rate. When the frequency approaches zero, the motor is shut off. A small amount of <b>braking</b> torque is available to help decelerate the load a little faster than it would stop if the motor were simply switched off and allowed to coast. Additional <b>braking</b> torque {{can be obtained by}} adding a <b>braking</b> circuit (resistor controlled by a transistor) to dissipate the <b>braking</b> energy. With a four-quadrant rectifier (active front-end), the VFD is able to brake the load by applying a reverse torque and injecting the energy back to the AC line.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brake</b> system {{consists}} of electro-pneumatic systems and regenerative <b>brakes,</b> providing multiple uses including high integrity emergency <b>brakes,</b> service <b>brakes,</b> security <b>brakes</b> and parking <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: In {{this view}} of an {{automobile}} disc <b>brake,</b> the <b>brake</b> pad is the black material held by the red <b>brake</b> caliper. The <b>brake</b> lining {{is that part of}} the <b>brake</b> pad which actually contacts the metal <b>brake</b> disc (rotor) when the <b>brake</b> is engaged.|$|R
50|$|Transmission <b>brakes</b> use drum <b>brakes,</b> {{rather than}} disc <b>brakes,</b> {{as they are}} {{intended}} as a static parking <b>brake,</b> rather than a high performance dynamic <b>brake.</b> Drum <b>brakes</b> allow simpler adjustment with cable-actuated hand lever mechanisms. The <b>brake</b> is mounted to the rear output shaft of the transfer box.|$|R
5|$|A crane, {{where the}} hoist motor stops and reverses frequently, and <b>braking</b> is {{required}} to slow the load during lowering.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the <b>braking</b> effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the <b>braking</b> energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative <b>braking.</b>|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, Bolliger & Mabillard uses {{three types}} of <b>braking</b> system; friction, magnetic, and water.|$|E
50|$|The {{three types}} of {{foundation}} <b>brake</b> systems are “S” cam <b>brakes,</b> disc <b>brakes</b> and wedge <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Brakes</b> were {{air over}} {{hydraulic}} with drum <b>brakes</b> on all wheels. Air <b>brake</b> connections at the rear were used for trailer <b>brakes.</b> The M815, M818, and M819 had separate controls to apply the trailer <b>brakes</b> separately from the service <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|BMW Motorrad uses {{a system}} called Integral ABS, {{in which the}} front <b>brake</b> lever {{operates}} both {{the front and rear}} <b>brakes,</b> while the <b>brake</b> pedal operates only the rear <b>brake.</b> In the inverse, Honda's system that features both combined <b>brakes</b> and anti-lock <b>brakes</b> is dubbed Combined ABS. In this system, the rear <b>brake</b> pedal operates both front and rear <b>brake,</b> and the front <b>brake</b> lever operates the front calipers, which in turn activates a secondary master cylinder to engage the rear <b>brake.</b> ABS modulators are installed on both the front and rear wheel.|$|R
5|$|Quadrant IV - Generating or <b>braking,</b> reverse braking-decelerating {{quadrant}} {{with negative}} speed and positive torque.|$|E
5|$|The <b>braking</b> {{system is}} {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock <b>Braking</b> System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the <b>braking</b> system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
5|$|The {{vehicles}} {{have three}} <b>braking</b> systems: a primary regenerative dynamic brake, a secondary disc brake and an emergency rail brake. When <b>braking</b> with the regenerative brake, the energy can be fed {{back to the}} overhead wires. The trams are dimensioned to operate an entire day with the dynamic brakes disconnected from one bogie, and for one hour if disconnected from two bogies, in which case only disc brakes will be used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brakes</b> with <b>Brake</b> Hold Control {{holding the}} car at a stop {{without the use of}} a <b>brake</b> pedal, Electronic <b>Brake</b> Distribution, <b>Brake</b> Assist, an Agile Handling Assist that applies the <b>brakes</b> on the wheels inside a curve, and Vehicle Stability Assist are standard.|$|R
40|$|Eliminating <b>brake</b> noises {{generated}} during <b>brake</b> {{application is}} an important issue in the improvement of comfort in vehicles. <b>Brake</b> noises Cfrequency 1 - 15 kHz) are ofen called <b>brake</b> squeal. On the other hand, <b>brake</b> noises Cfrequency 200 - 500 Hz) are ojten called <b>brake</b> groan noise. The studies on drum <b>brake</b> squeal, disc <b>brake</b> squeal and disc <b>brake</b> groan noise have already been presented in references (2), (3) and (4), where theoretical analyses on these <b>brake</b> noises were described. This paper shows that the equations of motion are represented by the same type of equations. Based on these analyses. I t i s clear that drum <b>brake</b> squeal, disc squeal and disc <b>brake</b> groan noise are generated by the same cause-dynamic instability of the <b>brake</b> system with friction force variations...|$|R
5000|$|Power off <b>brakes</b> stop or hold a load when {{electrical}} power is either accidentally lost or intentionally disconnected. In the past, {{some companies have}} referred to these as [...] "fail safe" [...] <b>brakes.</b> These <b>brakes</b> are typically used on or near an electric motor. Typical applications include robotics, holding <b>brakes</b> for Z axis ball screws and servo motor <b>brakes.</b> <b>Brakes</b> are available in multiple voltages and can have either standard backlash or zero backlash hubs. Multiple disks {{can also be used}} to increase <b>brake</b> torque, without increasing <b>brake</b> diameter. There are 2 main types of holding <b>brakes.</b> The first is spring applied <b>brakes.</b> The second is permanent magnet <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
5|$|As the {{collapse}} continues, the rotation rate can increase {{to the point}} where the accreting protostar can break up due to centrifugal force at the equator. Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000years to avoid this scenario. One possible explanation for the <b>braking</b> is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind in magnetic <b>braking.</b> The expanding wind carries away the angular momentum and slows down the rotation rate of the collapsing protostar.|$|E
5|$|Cement {{was placed}} at the hairpin around Kubica's accident. Räikkönen ran wide after he misjudged the <b>braking</b> on the dust. The Super Aguri of Takuma Sato went past him as a result and moved into 10th place.|$|E
5|$|Data Recorders – These {{are often}} placed in {{ambulances}} to record such information as speed, <b>braking</b> power and time, activation of active emergency warnings such as lights and sirens, {{as well as}} seat belt usage. These are often used in coordination with GPS units.|$|E
50|$|ICF bogie uses {{two types}} of <b>brake</b> beams. 13 ton and 16 ton. Both of the <b>brake</b> beams are {{fabricated}} structures. The <b>brake</b> beam is made from steel pipes and welded at the ends. The <b>brake</b> beam has a typical isosceles triangle shape. The two ends of the <b>brake</b> beam have a provision for fixing a <b>brake</b> head. The <b>brake</b> head in turn receives the <b>brake</b> block. The material of the <b>brake</b> block is non-asbestos and non-metallic in nature.it is a safety item.|$|R
5000|$|Cyclocross Cantilever <b>brake</b> bosses {{are more}} often {{equipped}} with traditional center-pull cantilever <b>brakes</b> than the more contemporary and powerful linear-pull <b>brakes</b> ("V-brakes") due to two reasons: native compatibility (insufficient <b>brake</b> cable pull) {{with the majority of}} drop-bar <b>brake</b> levers; and the cantilever <b>brake's</b> greater <b>brake</b> pad-to-rim clearance, which minimizes drag in muddy conditions. [...] "Mini-V's" [...] are gaining in popularity as they have both the native cable pull, and some of the increased power of traditional linear-pull <b>brakes</b> over cantilever <b>brakes.</b>|$|R

5|$|During the Blizzard of 1996, on January 6, a Metro {{operator}} {{was killed}} when a train failed {{to stop at the}} Shady Grove station. The four-car train overran the station platform and struck an unoccupied train that was awaiting assignment. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found that the crash was a result of a failure in the train's computer-controlled <b>braking</b> system. The NTSB recommended that Metro grant train operators the ability to manually control the <b>braking</b> system, even in inclement weather, and recommended that Metro prohibit parked rail cars on tracks used by incoming outbound trains.|$|E
5|$|For other {{problems}} {{so long as}} power is available for the <b>braking</b> and steering system, the vehicle can be conventionally towed subject to instructions in the owner's manual. Using the car to tow trailers is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Front flat tire. <b>Braking</b> a {{wheel with}} a flat tire can cause the tire {{to come off the}} rim which greatly reduces {{friction}} and, {{in the case of a}} front wheel, result in a loss of balance.|$|E
50|$|Westinghouse air <b>brakes</b> and vacuum <b>brakes</b> (or no {{continuous}} <b>brakes</b> at all) {{are usually}} fitted. Dual <b>brakes</b> or piped only can overcome incompatibilities. Vacuum <b>brakes</b> {{are considered to}} be obsolete. Electronically controlled pneumatic <b>brakes</b> (ECP) are starting to be fitted on faster, heavy-duty trains for higher performance, and the two ECP systems are compatible. Air <b>brakes</b> are to be preferred to vacuum <b>brakes</b> because of their greater power.|$|R
50|$|Another type {{of power}} <b>brake</b> {{installed}} in automobiles {{is called the}} drum <b>brake.</b> This type of <b>brake,</b> in general, will create some friction that will slow down the wheel. How this works {{is there is a}} <b>brake</b> cylinder that connects master cylinder to the drum <b>brake</b> via <b>brake</b> lines that transfer pressure from the master cylinder. When the driver pushes the <b>brake</b> pedal with his/her foot, the pistons inside the cylinder will activate. The activation of this piston will allow two <b>brake</b> shoes located within the drum of the <b>brake</b> to expand, thus generating friction to slow down and stop the wheel. Usually, this <b>brake</b> is located in the rear wheels of the vehicle, while the disk <b>brake</b> is located {{at the front of the}} vehicle. A car may also have only drum <b>brakes</b> or disc <b>brakes</b> both front and rear.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brake</b> linings are the {{consumable}} {{surfaces in}} <b>brake</b> systems, such as drum <b>brakes</b> and disc <b>brakes</b> used in transport vehicles.|$|R
5|$|How much <b>braking</b> {{force to}} apply to each wheel depends both on ground {{conditions}} and on the balance of weight on the wheels at each instant in time. The total <b>braking</b> force cannot exceed the gravity force on the rider and bike times the coefficient of friction µ of the tire on the ground. mgµ >= Ff + Fr. A skid occurs if the ratio of either Ff over Nf or Fr over Nr is greater than µ, with a rear wheel skid having less of {{a negative impact on}} lateral stability.|$|E
5|$|In September 2017, {{a report}} with photos {{surfaced}} that the <b>braking</b> {{system on the}} launch side of the track may have been damaged, causing the ride to close indefinitely. Cedar Point did not acknowledge the incident and stated the closure was for maintenance reasons.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are relatively inefficient at converting on-board fuel energy to propulsion {{as most of}} the energy is wasted as heat, and the rest while the engine is idling. Electric motors, on the other hand, are more efficient at converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric drive vehicles do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during <b>braking</b> through regenerative <b>braking.</b> Typically, conventional gasoline engines effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and diesel engines can reach on-board efficiencies of 20%, while electric drive vehicles typically have on-board efficiencies of around 80%.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had a {{compressed air}} through <b>brake,</b> an auxiliary <b>brake</b> and a hand <b>brake</b> that <b>braked</b> the third axle.|$|R
50|$|Haldex {{focuses on}} <b>brake</b> products, air {{suspension}} systems and products to enhance safety for heavy vehicles. The Foundation <b>Brake</b> product line includes <b>brake</b> products for wheel ends such as disc <b>brakes,</b> <b>brake</b> adjusters for drum <b>brakes</b> and actuators. Air Controls comprises products that improve {{the safety and}} driving dynamics of the <b>brake</b> system, such as compressed air dryers, valves, ABS and EBS.|$|R
50|$|Air powered drum <b>brakes</b> {{were used}} on all axles; the trailer <b>brakes</b> could be {{operated}} {{independently of the}} service <b>brakes.</b> A single disk transmission <b>brake</b> parking <b>brake</b> was also provided. This used four <b>brake</b> pads with a cable clasp mechanism onto a 16 in, mounted behind the auxiliary transmission.|$|R
