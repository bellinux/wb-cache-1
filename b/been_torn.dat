5|$|There is an {{appendix}} {{marked in}} the index, which lists the Psalms of Solomon and probably contained more apocryphal/pseudepigraphical books, {{but it has}} <b>been</b> <b>torn</b> off and the pages containing these books have also been lost.|$|E
5|$|Few {{buildings}} are {{left on the}} north side of the highway. The most notable are the wooden Southern Pacific saltbox-style section house and workers' bunkhouse, both built in 1887. A train depot and post office both stood in this area, but have <b>been</b> <b>torn</b> down. Three extant farmworkers' bungalows, built by the Del Valle family in 1916, are located west of the section house.|$|E
5|$|Vespasian {{started his}} own {{redevelopment}} of the site around AD70 to 72, possibly funding the construction with booty seized after the Roman victory in the First Jewish-Roman War in AD70. The lake was in-filled and the site designated as the location for the Flavian Amphitheatre. Reverting the private use by Nero to a more popular social purpose of a colosseum raised Vespasian's popularity. Gladiatorial schools (ludi) and other support buildings were later constructed within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea, much of which had <b>been</b> <b>torn</b> down.|$|E

5|$|When the Roman fleet reached Africa, {{a council}} was held aboard Belisarius' {{flagship}} (The Vandalic War, I.15), {{where many of}} his officers advocated an immediate attack on Carthage itself, especially since {{it was the only}} fortified city in the Vandal realm, the walls of the other cities having <b>been</b> <b>torn</b> down to prevent a rebellion. Belisarius, however, mindful of the fate of the 468 expedition and wary of an encounter with the Vandal fleet, spoke against it. Thus the army disembarked and built a fortified camp to spend the night.|$|E
5|$|Aware {{that his}} ship was {{suffering}} {{the worst of}} the casualties, L'Héritier ordered his men to attempt to board the British ship of the line, but first one and then another attempt to do so was driven back with heavy casualties. The lighting of Hercule had gone out {{at the beginning of the}} engagement, leaving her crew confused, and as a result, only around 40 men answered when L'Héritier ordered the boarding; he was himself injured twice, to the head by a sabre and to the thigh by a pike, while leading the assault. At 10:30, after an hour of continual bombardment L'Héritier surrendered: Hercules hull had <b>been</b> <b>torn</b> open, five guns were dismounted with others damaged and more than two fifths of the crew killed or wounded. Jason was approaching fast and the rest of Bridport's fleet was close enough to see the muzzle flashes from the battle.|$|E
5|$|James J. Murakami {{supervised}} the production design. Location scouting revealed {{that many of}} the older buildings in Los Angeles had <b>been</b> <b>torn</b> down, including the entire neighborhood where Collins lived. Suburban areas in San Dimas, San Bernardino and Pasadena doubled for 1920s Los Angeles instead. The Old Town district of San Dimas stood in for Collins' neighborhood and some adjacent locales. Murakami said Old Town was chosen because very little had changed since the 1920s. It was used for interiors and exteriors; the crew decorated the area with a subdued color palette to evoke feelings of comfort. For some exterior shots they renovated derelict properties in neighborhoods of Los Angeles that still possessed 1920s architecture. The crew staged {{the third floor of the}} Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles into a replica of the 1920s Los Angeles City Council chambers.|$|E

5|$|New York, Boston, and Philadelphia {{did their}} best to outdo each other in the {{celebrations}} honoring Lafayette. Needing a place to hold a reception for him, Philadelphia renovated the Old State House (today Independence Hall), which might otherwise have <b>been</b> <b>torn</b> down. Until that point, it had not been usual in the United States to build monuments, but Lafayette's visit set off a wave of construction, usually with Lafayette, in his capacity as Mason, laying the cornerstone. The arts benefited by his visits as well, as many cities commissioned portraits for their civic buildings, and the likenesses were seen on innumerable souvenirs. Lafayette had intended to visit only the original thirteen states during a four-month visit; the stay stretched to sixteen months as he visited all twenty-four.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June, Model {{was sent}} to rescue Army Group Centre, which had <b>been</b> <b>torn</b> apart by Operation Bagration, the Soviet {{offensive}} in Belorussia. The Ninth Army (Model's old command) and Fourth Army were trapped, and the Red Army was about to liberate Minsk. Despite the catastrophic situation, Model believed that he could still hold Minsk, but this would require Fourth Army {{to break out of}} its pocket, and reinforcements to counter-attack the Soviet advance. The reinforcements, in turn, could only be obtained by pulling back, thus shortening the line and freeing up troops. The consensus is that the German position was doomed, regardless of what Model could have done, but Hitler refused to sanction either Fourth Army's escape or a general withdrawal, until it was too late.|$|E
5|$|The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., {{was filmed}} {{primarily}} on the Warner Bros. soundstages. Town and street scenes were staged on the Western backlot, known as Laramie Street. It {{was one of the}} last Western shows to use the backlot. Cuse said that logistics were a problem because so many of the Hollywood Western sets and towns had <b>been</b> <b>torn</b> down by the 1990s. Outdoor scenes were shot on the Warner Bros. ranch in Valencia, California; Bronson Canyon in Los Angeles; and the Valuze Ranch in Santa Clarita, California. Some of the locomotive scenes from Brisco were filmed on location at Railtown 1897 State Historic Park in Jamestown, California. A painting used in the show as a backdrop to create illusions of greater depth perspectives is exhibited at the park.|$|E
50|$|The {{location}} of the plaza had been {{the site of the}} San Juan de Dios hospital which <b>was</b> <b>torn</b> down in 1850 and replaced by a railway station, which in turn <b>was</b> <b>torn</b> down between 1911 and 1918.|$|R

5|$|The {{police officer}} who {{discovered}} the wreck initially suspected that only the semi had gone off the road. After further investigation, he found the van and called for emergency services, whose arrival was delayed by freezing rain. The rear wall and {{a large portion of}} the right-hand side of the van, including three rows of seats, had <b>been</b> <b>torn</b> away, ejecting several occupants. Seven players and the wife of the team coach were pronounced dead at the scene. The coach, his daughter and the two other players survived the accident and were rushed to Chaleur Regional Hospital in Bathurst. Of the injured, one was listed in critical condition, and two in stable. The fourth was released shortly after the accident. The driver of the truck was not injured.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal was now {{isolated}} at {{the northern}} end of the British line, under heavy fire from Formidable as well as the Spanish shore batteries and gunboats and unable to manoeuvre or effectively respond. Ferris attempted to notify Saumarez of his ship's precarious position, but his signal halyards had <b>been</b> <b>torn</b> away by shot and it was sometime before assistance could be organised. The rest of the squadron was ordered to provide ship's boats to attempt to tow Hannibal off the shoal but the attempt failed, Caesars pinnace sinking in the process after being struck by a cannonball. Ultimately, Hannibal was left stranded as the last of the seabreeze disappeared, preventing any of the other British ships from coming to Ferris' assistance. There was however a light land breeze from the northwest that initially favoured the outnumbered and battered French squadron, Linois immediately ordering his ships to sever their anchor cables and use the breeze to manoeuvre slowly into stronger defensive positions closer inshore. His flagship Formidable successfully completed the manoeuvre, but neither Indomptable nor Desaix could be brought back under control in time, and both grounded, Desaix directly in front of Algeciras and Indomptable northeast of Isla Verda with her bow facing out to sea.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} liberation, Belgium began {{a period of}} rapid {{economic}} recovery {{and the process of}} political reconstruction began. The traditional party system had <b>been</b> <b>torn</b> apart by the war and occupation. The two major ideological blocks proceeded to create their own parties: socialists created the Belgian Socialist Party (PSB–BSP), while Catholics and conservatives created the Christian Social Party (PSC–CVP). The biggest change in early post-liberation politics was the surge of support for the Communist Party of Belgium, which become the third party in Belgian politics until 1949, temporarily displacing the Liberal Party. The Walloon Movement also re-emerged after the war, promoting the culture and economic interests of the French-speaking areas in the south. The period saw major reform of trade unions following the creation of the first large unified union, the General Federation of Belgian Labour (FGTB–ABVV), in April 1945 with 248,000 members nationwide. By 1947, however, the political structure of the Belgian state had stabilised.|$|E

5|$|The {{forensic}} {{examination of}} the lead pipes found {{at the murder scene}} and in the Corsair's boot revealed traces of blood on the pipe from 46Lower Belgrave Street. This proved to be a mixture of Lady Lucan's (blood group A) and Sandra Rivett's (B) blood. Hair belonging to Veronica Lucan was also found on that pipe, but none belonging to Sandra Rivett. The pipe found inside the car had neither blood nor hair on it. Home Office scientists were unable to prove conclusively that both pipes were cut from the same, longer, piece of piping, although they thought it likely. The tape wrapped around both was similar, but those too could not be conclusively linked. The letters written to Bill Shand-Kydd were stained with blood considered to be from both women. The letter to Michael Stoop had no blood on it, but it was later proven that the paper it was written on had <b>been</b> <b>torn</b> from a writing pad found in the Corsair's boot.|$|E
5|$|Navigation {{through the}} rocks {{of the bay}} had been difficult, and {{as she entered the}} bay Amazones rudder had <b>been</b> <b>torn</b> away, {{rendering}} the ship unmanoeuverable. With Amazone trapped, Macnamara called {{up the rest of the}} Cherbourg squadron, the frigate HMS Amelia under Captain Frederick Paul Irby and the brig-sloops HMS Goshawk under Commander James Lilburn and HMS Hawk under Commander Henry Bourchier. This force was required to remain a substantial distance offshore as the rocky coastline posed a considerable danger to the British ships. Macnamara's plan was to wait for high tide and then bring the squadron closer inshore to bombard the French frigate into surrender. As they waited, the squadron was joined by Niobe from the Le Havre under Captain John Wentworth Loring. At 16:00 the tides were optimal for the attack and Niobe, Amelia and Berwick sailed into the bay. However, Rosseau had situated Amazone in a strong position, protected from close attack by rocks and shoals and in consequence the British ships could only fire as they wore around, resulting in scattered and inaccurate fire. As they advanced, the British ships came under fire from Amazone, which killed one sailor on Berwick and killed one and wounded another on Amelia, while the British fire had no effect on the French ship. At 18:00, Macnamara withdrew his ships from the bay, all three vessels having suffered considerable damage to their rigging and sails from Amazones shot.|$|E
5|$|On 14 August 1782, Hector {{separated}} {{from the rest of}} the prize ships in heavy weather and on 22 August encountered two large French frigates, Aigle of 40 guns and Gloire of 32 guns. Together these vessels significantly outclassed the leaky ship of the line in weight of shot, but Captain John Bourchier determined to resist the French attack, preparing Hector as the French approached. The French ships surrounded Hector at 02:00 and the engagement was furiously contested, with Bourchier wounded early on and many of his officers following him below with serious injuries. Within a short period, Inman was the only officer remaining on deck, but he was able to successfully drive the French away following a failed attempt to board, although Hector was left in a severely damaged state with 75 men killed or wounded. A hurricane that followed the battle inflicted further damage and the ship was badly flooded, seawater ruining the food supplies and threatening to sink the ship completely. Some of the crew were so ill and exhausted that they collapsed and died while manning the pumps. Inman only managed to prevent the remaining sailors from fleeing below decks by carrying loaded pistols and threatening men who refused his orders. Once the storm had abated it was clear that Hector was foundering; her rudder and masts had <b>been</b> <b>torn</b> away and the pumps were unable to keep pace with the water leaking through the battered hull. For two weeks Inman made desperate efforts to keep the ship afloat, as food and water supplies ran low and the hull began to collapse in on itself. Fortunately for the men aboard Hector, the tiny snow Hawke appeared and approached the ship of the line to render assistance. Throwing his cargo overboard, Captain John Hill worked with Inman to supervise the transfer of all of Hectors remaining men, many of whom were wounded or sick, into Hawke as Hector rapidly sank. No men were lost in the operation and Inman was the last to leave, Hector disappearing ten minutes after the boat carrying him reached Hawke. The snow set sail for St John's in Newfoundland, its crew and passengers subsisting on short rations; they arrived off the port on the same day they consumed the last water supplies.|$|E
