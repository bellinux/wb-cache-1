Following the analysis of vote outcome and plenary debates in 11 euro states, {{it is found that}} the financial position of a state (creditors versus debtors) does not explain the patterns of support and opposition. Rather, two other factors account for these differences: Euroscepticism, and the government and opposition cleavage. In particular, whereas Eurosceptic MPs voted and argued against the EFSF, the parliamentary majorities supported it. Surprisingly, although the legal basis of the EFSF draws on solidarity among the European Union Member States, the supporters of the EFSF did not refer to this principle in their speeches but rather to pragmatic considerations such as national economic interests...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} the author {{describes}} how the EU perceives and manages the common European interests {{in the context of}} globalization and of agro-food political and economic affairs. On the one hand the EU has to anticipate on the coming WTO-round, which will force the EU to continue to operationalise the free market ideology, particularly in the field of agriculture and food production. This urges the EU to diminish the budget for the CAP and to enlarge the EU-market by opening its borders to CEE countries. On the other hand the EU has to cope with many obstacles mostly produced by well-organized agro-entrepreneurs that don’t want to accept savings in the CAP subsidiary system. Then the total <b>budgetary</b> <b>capacity</b> will not be enough to incorporate the CEE economies. The risk of this political process is that the EU will loose power in the coming WTO negotiations. Furthermore, the CEE countries will continue to be in a marginal position within Europe.

It may be symptomatic of male privilege, a theory that outlines pervasive, ubiquitous discrimination that favors men from birth until death. However, egalitarian wage laws passed by Congress rigidly enforce equal pay for equal work at the highest echelons of public service, including Congress, the Cabinet, and the presidency. Is male privilege likely to manifest despite such legislation?

The concept of PPP in India has been widely recognized as a natural response to meet the colossal demand for housing, government’s dwindling <b>budgetary</b> <b>capacity,</b> massive demand coming from a section of the society for better quality of services and a need for a catalyst to boost macro-economic conditions. The city has been in the forefront of housing market revival and prime government agencies have, under the PPP framework, assumed a unique facilitating role without undermining the pervasive influence of the regulatory ideology. As the influential partner in implementation, the government is able to revise regulations related to land supply, building materials, target groups, affordability, building bye laws and regulatory framework as and when necessary.

40|$|AbstractMunicipalities {{aiming at}} {{mitigating}} climate change by implementing new energy efficiency technologies face <b>budgetary</b> and <b>capacity</b> constraints. Outsourcing through energy service contracting {{could provide a}} solution. This paper reports results from a survey of 1298 municipalities concerning barriers to retrofitting public street lighting and the possible role of energy service contracting to overcome these barriers. Using a logistic regression analysis, the authors investigate determinants of opting for energy service contracts {{in the specific context}} of LED retrofits. Results point to an advantage of outsourcing in a financially and capacity-constrained environment, which corresponds with the main reasons for engaging in contracting: minimising investments and financial risks. However, municipalities often do not fully grasp the risks associated with retrofitting especially using a novel technology such as LED. In relation to that they underestimate the risk reduction potential of energy performance contracts (EPC). Previous experience with outsourcing increases the probability to engage in servitization although certain existing partnerships, particularly with utilities, prevent municipalities from considering energy performance contracts. Interestingly, engaging an energy consultant has a negative propensity to use energy service contracts, while pre-negotiated standardised contracts for energy performance contracts have a positive influence...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide an {{overview}} of documented attempts to implement needs-based health human resource planning in Canada and discuss an innovative needs-based approach to family physician planning in one Canadian province that facilitates the evaluation of policy options to address the gap between the supply of and requirements for family physicians. Background/Recent Research in Area Recently, there have been two exhaustive reviews of documented attempts at needs-based health human resource (HHR) planning worldwide (Tomblin Murphy et al., 2004, Tomblin Murphy et al., 2007 a). One of the overall conclusions of both reviews was that HHR planning in Canada has tended to be based on utilization patterns, the supply of health care professionals, and/or <b>budgetary</b> <b>capacity,</b> rather than on the actual health care needs of the population or the health policies governing it. There are several limitations to this approach, two of which are that it does not account for trends in population health need or trends in provider productivity. Improvements in health status would reduce the total service requirements in the population and improvements in productivity would increase the supply of services from the stock of providers. If such trends were to unfold, the forecasts would overestimate the requirements for HHR, and i...|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of the future viability of small farms {{is the subject of}} academic and political debates that have gained particular attention in recent years. Such debates are driven, in part, by renewed commitment by many countries and donors to explore the role of agricultural development for growth and poverty reduction. At the same time, increasingly integrated, globalized, and consumer-driven agricultural and food markets require smallholders to adapt to a new environment. Small farmers face the challenge of integration and competitiveness in new markets, {{but at the same time}} they are constrained by drastic reductions in the provision of basic public services as a result of recent policy reform, market liberalization, as well as <b>budgetary</b> and <b>capacity</b> limitations. Definition of Small Farms The concept of small farms can be approached from a variety of angles. Small-scale agriculture is often, albeit not always appropriately, used interchangeably with smallholder, family, subsistence, resourcepoor, low-income, low-input, or low-technology farming (Heidhues and Brüntrup 2003). The following examples of definitions illustrate the diversity of conceptual approaches to the term: Lipton defines family farms as “operated units in which most labor and enterprise come from the farm family, which puts much of its working time into the farm ” (2005) ...|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I look at {{two problems}} of resource planning at two major healthcare organizations. The Greater Los Angeles Station of the Veterans Health Administration and the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. The first chapter of this thesis is a brief introduction to the research presented in subsequent chapters. The second chapter of this thesis considers the problem of minimizing daily expected resource usage and overtime costs across multiple parallel resources such as anesthesiologists and operating rooms, which are used to conduct a variety of surgical procedures at large multi-specialty hospitals. To address this problem, a two-stage mixed-integer stochastic dynamic programming model with recourse is developed. The first stage allocates these resources across multiple surgeries with uncertain durations and prescribes the sequence of surgeries to these resources. The second stage determines actual start times to surgeries based on realized durations of preceding surgeries and assigns overtime to resources to ensure all surgeries are completed using the allocation and sequence determined in the first stage. A data driven robust optimization method that solves large-scale real-sized versions of this model close to optimality is developed. This model is validated and implemented as a decision support system at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. This {{has led to an}} average daily cost savings of around 7 % or estimated to be 2. 2 million on an annual basis. In addition, the insights based on this model have significantly influenced decision making at the operating services department at this hospital. In the third chapter of this thesis the planning problem for HIV screening, testing, and care is analyzed. This problem consists of determining the optimal fraction of patients to be screened in every period as well as the optimum staffing level at each part of the healthcare system to maximize the total health benefits to the patients measured by quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. This problem is modeled as a nonlinear mixed integer programming program comprising disease progression (the transition of the patients across health states), system dynamics (the flow of patients in different health states across various parts of the healthcare delivery system), and <b>budgetary</b> and <b>capacity</b> constraints. On applying the model to the Greater Los Angeles (GLA) station in the Veterans Health Administration system, it was found that a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended routine screening policy in which all patients visiting the system are screened for HIV irrespective of risk factors may not be feasible because of budgetary constraints. Consequently, the model was used to develop and evaluate managerially relevant policies within existent <b>capacity</b> and <b>budgetary</b> constraints to improve upon the current risk based screening policy of screening only high risk patients.

40|$|As {{unemployment}} in this recession holds near 10 percent {{and a growing}} number of Americans becomes impoverished, much work remains to reduce and respond to poverty and economic distress. In part, this work can build on the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), better known as the stimulus package, which has moderated the effects of the recession but will soon phase out. This brief provides a framework and recommendations for next steps, directly related to the stimulus package and driven by other lessons learned from the recession and its aftermath. Next steps to reduce poverty and economic distress are crucial for two reasons. First, despite the fact that employer payrolls have begun to grow again, high unemployment and related damage from the worst economic slowdown of a generation will likely continue for three to five more years. Elevated unemployment for this length of time will substantially harm many individuals and families, damage the long-term prospects of the children who grow up in these families, erode state <b>budgetary</b> <b>capacity</b> to provide education and social services, and hamper the longer-term performance of the American economy. Second, persistent poverty and unemployment were problems for many Americans even before the economic slowdown. Therefore, the United States needs to reinvigorate its ongoing strategies for improving the income and labor market prospects of low-wage and less-educated workers in the short term and the long term. This brief ranges across policy domains often treated separately, including poverty and safety net, child and family, and youth and adult employment and workforce development policies. Brief 15, July 2010 However, we did not address two important policy topics that would each require a book in itself: health reform (especially given the recent passage of reform legislation) and K– 12 education (where a robust federal effort is already under way). ...|$|E

The new Law on Civil Servants and Employees in Local and Regional Self-Government came in {{to force}} on 31 st July 2008. After {{a decade and a}} half of provisory solutions, on that day, local civil service was, for the first time, {{regulated}} by the law whose »life« was not extended for the needs of local civil service years after it had ceased to be implemented on the state civil service. The Law is a so lid piece of regulation that has improved the circumstances in the field it regulates. Further more, many suggestions of local units’ associations were taken in to account during its drafting. This paper is devoted to possible further advances in regulating the matter. At the conceptual, legal-political level, the main disadvantages of the new Law are a missed chance to pass a uniform piece of civil servants regulation, substandard regulation of the institutes regulating state service, and, finally, delaying the regulation of the classification and remuneration system for later period. A uniform regulation of the rights, obligations, and responsibilities of state and local civil servants need not interfere with the natural and prescribes differences between state administration and local self-government, including local autonomy. If one begins with the claim that there are no more or less important civil servants corpuses, one can not but wonder what the purpose of partially substandard regulation of civil servants relations at local level is. The paper lists such substandard solutions, among which the most important refer to the second-instance body deciding on the appeals against first-instance acts in the matters of rights and responsibilities of local civil servants and employees. The standards of local autonomy, the particularities of local units significantly different in size, and the insufficient administrative capacities of some local units are not in favour of too strict regulation of the classification system. It might be purposeful to bind the salaries to the <b>budgetary</b> <b>capacity</b> of a local unit. The legislator may perhaps determine the relations within the remuneration system, but more than that would be questionable both autonomy and purpose-wise. The paper also contains an analysis of the more important legal voids (acting heads of administrative bodies, internal auditor on a separate place of work, competence of issuing the rule book on systematisation of work places, the protection of procedural rights of the candidates whose job applications are not taken in to consideration, etc.), certain normative in consistencies, the protection of whistle blowers, and the possible nomotechnical improvement...|$|E

It is envisaged that this will enable health practitioners both in the public and private health sub- sectors to understand the various activities required to be carried out. Health and safety concerns and guidance have been addressed as part of this policy and guidelines to ensure that managements of institutions put in place measures to limit exposure of their staff and the general public to the hazardous components of health care waste. It is hoped that provision will be made for the supply of all necessary personal protective equipment and their use enforced during the performance of all activities that potentially generate infectious waste as well as those that go into the handling of such waste. The need for training and the monitoring of the healthcare waste management system have been outlined in order for the management at the facilities to enhance common knowledge of safe healthcare waste management and in order to evaluate their management practices during the implementation of the waste management system. The importance of ensuring the availability of financial resources to make the system function cannot be overemphasized.
