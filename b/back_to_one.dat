5|$|Production on {{the first}} series of Cold Feet began in January 1998.

Throughout 1998, he retained his job at the BBC, working on three radio shows per week at the same time as writing Cold Feet. During the second series he cut <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> show per week. By the time of the third series in 2000, he felt confident enough that he would have a future in television that he was able to give up radio presenting completely. He moved from his home in London to Cambridge, where he was able to write for two full days a week and at evenings and weekends.|$|E
5|$|The Sun-grazing comets {{observed}} in 1843 (Great Comet of 1843) and 1963 (Comet Pereyra) {{seem to be}} closely related and belong to the subgroup I, although when their orbits are traced <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> previous perihelion, {{the differences between the}} orbital elements are still rather large, probably implying that they broke apart from each other one revolution before that. They may not be related to the comet of 1106, but rather a comet that returned about 50 years before that. Subgroup I also includes comets seen in 1695, 1880 (Great Southern Comet of 1880) and in 1887 (Great Southern Comet of 1887), as well as the vast majority of comets detected by the SOHO mission (see below).|$|E

5|$|The game {{keeps track}} of the player's {{completed}} percentage of the storyline, increased by viewing the scenarios comprising each Episode. If 100% {{of the game is}} completed, an additional ending will be unlocked. The game features a fork in its plot, allowing the player to make a choice that changes what scenes they see and the number of percentage points they acquire afterward. It is impossible to see all of the game's content on a single playthrough, due to this fork in the storyline, although it is possible to achieve 100% storyline completion in a single playthrough. However, a 100% storyline completion can only be achieved through one of the two possible storylines. When the game is completed for the first time, it unlocks a New Game Plus option that allows the player to restart the game with all of the items, Garment Grids, dresspheres and storyline completion percentage achieved previously. However, all character levels are set <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E

Alonso's return to the style of an old-fashioned helmet was because he re-joined the team Renault at that time. The design he used in the 2009 season was replacing the blue to a bright red helmet at the top and the bottom. The design was based on Michael Schumacher's helmet.|$|E

25|$|Reading from NOR flash {{is similar}} to reading from random-access memory, {{provided}} the address and data bus are mapped correctly. Because of this, most microprocessors can use NORflash memory as execute in place (XIP) memory, meaning that programs stored in NORflash can be executed directly from the NORflash without needing to be copied into RAM first. NORflash may be programmed in a random-access manner similar to reading. Programming changes bits from a logical one to a zero. Bits that are already zero are left unchanged. Erasure must happen a block at a time, and resets all the bits in the erased block <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>one.</b> Typical block sizes are 64, 128, or 256KiB.|$|E

A number of storylines were submitted, with six eventually being commissioned between September 1984 and February 1985. However, in February 1985, the BBC announced that, as a cost-cutting measure owing to the costs of several large projects (not least of which was the launch of EastEnders), Season 23 was being put back from its planned transmission in January 1986 to the following September, which would be a different financial year.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding the {{introduction}} of electric services, the Rickmansworth branch suffered {{in the face of}} the more direct services to London provided by the Metropolitan.
