50|$|Elkay {{currently}} {{has four main}} product categories - Coolers; Sinks, Faucets and Accessories; Cabinetry; Foodservice and Millwork. Their breadth of plumbing products includes 4,000 SKUs of kitchen sinks made {{of a variety of}} different materials. Elkay manufactures residential kitchen and commercial products, such as sinks, bars, faucets, cabinets and commercial kitchen appliances. The company has the largest water cooler offering in the market, and recently shipped its five millionth water cooler. Most recently, Elkay elaborated on water cooler units by creating <b>bottle</b> <b>filler</b> units that can both retrofit to existing water cooler units, or stand alone. These units decreased plastic waste through promotion of using reusable plastic bottles. Their most popular <b>bottle</b> <b>filler</b> unit model is the ezH2O. Elkay products are sold through distributors, designers, home center establishments and various internet retailers.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, Elkay {{launched}} the EZH2O Water <b>Bottle</b> <b>Filler,</b> which is recognized for contributing to keeping plastic bottles out of landfills. The unique counter {{on the unit}} allowed for users {{to see how many}} bottles had been saved from landfills at a particular location, which had the effect of “making the thing go viral”. The EZH2O first came about when Elkay business travelers started noticing their fellow travelers doing [...] "the airport dance." [...] More people were toting plastic water bottles. Rather than drinking from the fountain, they wanted to refill those jugs. It wasn't working. The dance was a sort of shuffle done by travelers trying to tilt bottles at the proper angle for refilling without splashing water on their shoes.|$|E
50|$|Elkay Manufacturing Company, a {{manufacturer}} of stainless steel sinks, faucets and kitchen cabinets, was started in 1920 by Leopold & Louis Katz and Eleth Robarth, a tinsmith {{who came up with}} an idea to hand fabricate German silver sinks and deliver them in Chicago. Today, still privately owned by the founding family, Elkay has 3,500 employees worldwide and is America's largest stainless steel sink company. Over the years the products Elkay manufactures have expanded to include sinks, faucets, water coolers, drinking fountains, water <b>bottle</b> <b>fillers,</b> and residential and commercial kitchen and bath products.|$|R
40|$|Two carrier/shipping cask {{options are}} being {{developed}} to transport bottles of EBR-II fuel elements stored at INTEC. Some fuel bottles are intact, but some have developed leaks. Reactivity control requirements to maintain subcriticality during the hypothetical transport accident have been examined for both transport options for intact and leaking bottles. Poison rods, poison sleeves, and dummy <b>filler</b> <b>bottles</b> were considered; several possible poison materials and several possible dummy filler materials were studied. The minimum number of poison rods or dummy <b>filler</b> <b>bottles</b> has been determined for each carrier for transport of intact and leaking bottles...|$|R
50|$|Krones AG is a German {{packaging}} and bottling machine manufacturer. It is the world's leading manufacturer of lines for filling beverages in plastic and glass bottles or beverage cans. The company manufactures stretch blow-moulding machines for producing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) <b>bottles,</b> plus <b>fillers,</b> labellers, <b>bottle</b> washers, pasteurisers, inspectors, packers and palletisers. This product portfolio is complemented by material flow systems and process technology for producing beverages, plus syrup kitchens, for clients like breweries, dairies and soft-drink companies.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we are {{presenting}} a process loop {{that can be}} used in bottle washer machine. It is a holistic approach. Because wherever a control of liquid is required, it can be used. It can be used in chemical and oil industries also. Water is used for washing purpose in bottle washer machine. Total three parameters are controlled 1. level, 2. flow and 3. pressure etc. There is a very strong interaction in between these parameters. Pressure and flow are required to control for better washing. The aim is to maintain above listed variable by using Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). It increases efficiency and response time both. By modifying hardware this loop can use for <b>bottle</b> <b>filler</b> also. For that a valve is required at output side. Almost industry requirement is an output with safety. So, safety aspects are also considered in it. Different sensors and valves are used with PLC. They are controlled by a program. According to the program PLC generates different signals and valve is controlled. This way pressure, level and flow can control. As an extra feature a Human Machine Interface (HMI) is also connected. So, that user can change the set values directly...|$|E
40|$|Pasteurized {{bottled milk}} {{supplied}} {{by a single}} dairy was frequently found to be contaminated with Yersinia spp. Investigations were carried out at the dairy {{in an effort to}} pinpoint the source of these organisms. Viable counts obtained from milk bottle rinses indicated that bottle washing was often unsatisfactory, and on one occasion Y. frederiksenii was isolated from the pooled rinse water of six bottles. Samples of milk were taken on arrival at the dairy and at various stages following pasteurization. Heat resistance tests carried out on strains of yersinia isolated from pasteurized milk indicated that they would not survive the pasteurization process. However two strains of yersinia were isolated from a sample of milk taken immediately after pasteurization but before bottling. The thermograph indicated that the time/temperature conditions applied during pasteurization were adequate. The presence of yersinia strains in the milk at this stage therefore suggests that undetectable levels of raw milk were being allowed to contaminate the pasteurized milk. The absence of yersinia in cartoned samples produced on the same day as contaminated bottled samples indicated that environmental contamination of the <b>bottle</b> <b>filler</b> valve also may have occurred at times. Results of this investigation indicate that increased vigilance is required to ensure proper operation of pasteurizers and bottle washers...|$|E
40|$|We {{present in}} this paper a {{methodology}} for the industrial Automation Engineer to help him design, build and run computer-based systems containing, physical and software parts. This methodology enables him to define a system through its requirements and its specifications, and it allows him to validate and then to run it (for instance on a PLC, a Programmable Logical Controller). This methodology {{is based on the}} description of the computer based systems in terms of hierarchical temporal-components, which are described as synchronous subsystems validated through the use of temporal logic. The concept of temporal-component is an extension of the concept of objects, it is made of four parts: (i) a declarative part giving the links with other components, the signals and the variables, (ii) a set of local operations (hard/soft), (iii) a requirements part (named ‘Goals') and (iv) a working specification part (named 'Behavior ’ or ‘Controller’), these two last parts are written using an "engineering dialect " of the Temporal logic. The validation process consists in proving that the Behavior specification of the whole embedded-system satisfies its main goal using all the subcomponents ' Goals (for this, one can use an automatic prover such as the Stanford's STEP prover). These Temporal logic requirements and specifications can easily be translated in Ladder Diagrams and run on a PLC (Programmable Logical Controller) using for instance the international standard IEC 1131 - 3. Our "engineering dialect " of the Temporal logic is built so that the translation rules from the TCOM notation to provable Temporal Logic and also to executable Ladder Diagrams (PLC) are simple. A <b>bottle</b> <b>filler</b> system example is presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation on {{the capability of}} using commercially available plastic bottles as energy absorbing devices for safety crash barrier applications. The compression tests are conducted in vertical and horizontal orientations with bottles of various sizes and {{with a variety of}} filler materials such as air, water, foam, sand and paper pulp and also with mixture of such fillers. Results are compared in terms of varying plastic bottle size, <b>bottle</b> orientation and <b>filler</b> types. Results show that commercially available plastic bottles, with proper orientation and appropriate filler materials, are capable of absorbing significant amounts of crash energy...|$|R
