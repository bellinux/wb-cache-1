50|$|The cocoa woodcreeper was {{formerly}} {{included in the}} larger <b>buff-throated</b> <b>woodcreeper,</b> X. guttatus but has been recognized as specifically distinct. Eight subspecies are normally recognized, falling into two groups. It is not quite clear how these are {{related to each other}} and to the <b>buff-throated</b> <b>woodcreeper.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>buff-throated</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> (Xiphorhynchus guttatus) is a {{resident}} passerine bird found in tropical South America in the Guiana Shield and disjunctly {{in the northern}} Atlantic Forest. It formerly included the cocoa woodcreeper and the Lafresnayes woodcreeper as subspecies. Some authorities retain Lafresnayes position as a subspecies of the <b>buff-throated</b> <b>woodcreeper,</b> but the resulting group is polyphyletic (see Systematics and evolution).|$|E
50|$|Biogeography and {{molecular}} {{data suggest that}} the relationship between these taxa and the <b>buff-throated</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> deserves further study.|$|E
50|$|<b>Buff-throated</b> <b>woodcreepers</b> are {{restricted}} to humid forest and woodland. The taxa in north-eastern South America (polystictus and connectens) are generally the commonest large woodcreeper within their range, but the nominate taxon (X. g. guttatus), which is restricted to humid tropical Atlantic forest, has a fragmented population and is generally uncommon. They are insectivores which feed on ants and other insects and spiders. It feeds low in trees, usually alone, but groups will follow columns of army ants. The species builds a bark-lined nest in a tree hole or hollow stump and lays two white eggs.|$|R
50|$|The {{most likely}} {{evolutionary}} scenario {{is that from}} lower Amazonia, the ancestors of Lafresnaye's woodcreeper spread west- and southwestwards to the Andes, {{and those of the}} <b>buff-throated</b> and cocoa <b>woodcreeper</b> downriver and then along the coast of northern South America, where X. susurrans then branched off as the northern lineage. Indeed, {{it may be that the}} trans-Andean forms of the latter may constitute yet another good species, Lawrence's woodcreeper.|$|R
50|$|The cocoa woodcreeper (Xiphorhynchus susurrans) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} woodcreeper subfamily of the ovenbird family. It {{was formerly}} considered a subspecies of the <b>buff-throated</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> (X. guttatus).|$|E
5000|$|The Lafresnayes woodcreeper (Xiphorhynchus guttatoides) is a {{resident}} passerine bird found in tropical South America {{in the western}} and southern Amazon and adjacent sections of the Cerrado. It is often considered a subspecies of the <b>buff-throated</b> <b>woodcreeper,</b> but this combined [...] "species" [...] would be polyphyletic. It includes the dusky-billed woodcreeper (Xiphorhynchus guttatoides eytoni), which sometimes is considered a separate species (see Taxonomy).|$|E
50|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{is highly}} complex. It {{has often been}} considered a subspecies of the <b>buff-throated</b> <b>woodcreeper,</b> but molecular data indicates that this species is closer the cocoa woodcreeper {{than it is to}} Lafresnaye's woodcreeper. Alternatively, the eytoni group (incl. vicinalis and gracilirostris) has been considered a separate species, the dusky-billed woodcreeper (Xiphorhynchus (guttatoides) eytoni), but, despite its different looks, it is better considered a subspecies of the Lafresnaye's woodcreeper.|$|E
50|$|With a {{total length}} of 25-28 cm (10-11 in), this woodcreeper is, {{together}} with <b>buff-throated</b> <b>woodcreeper,</b> the largest {{member of the}} genus Xiphorhynchus. The wings and tail are rufous. The head, mantle and underparts are olive-brown streaked buff (subspecies X. g. guttatoides and X. g. dorbignyanus) or whitish (X. g. eytoni, X. g. gracilirostris and X. g. vicinalis). The bill is long, slightly decurved, and hooked at the tip. The bill is mainly pale horn (X. g. guttatoides and X. g. dorbignyanus) or blackish (X. g. eytoni, X. g. gracilirostris and X. g. vicinalis).|$|E
5000|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{is highly}} complex. The smaller cocoa woodcreeper (X. susurrans) from Central America and northwestern South America was formerly {{included in this}} species, but is now normally considered to be distinct. Of the remaining taxa, the pale-billed and buff-streaked guttatoides group (incl. dorbignyanus) and the dark-billed and whitish-streaked eytoni group (incl. vicinalis and gracilirostris) have often been considered separate species, as the Lafresnaye's woodcreeper (X. guttatoides) and the dusky-billed woodcreeper (X. eytoni). While visually very different, these two groups are now known to form a single clade (combined under a [...] "broad" [...] Lafresnaye's woodcreeper, X. guttatoides) separate from the nominate group (guttatus, polystictus and connectens) of X. guttatus, which instead is closer to X. susurrans. Biogeography and molecular {{data suggest that the}} relationship between these subspecies and the taxa now included in X. guttatoides and X. susurrans deserves further study. Depending of the outcome of these studies, the <b>buff-throated</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> could be restricted to the southern coastal population, which is endangered by habitat fragmentation, making a change in conservation status necessary.|$|E
5000|$|Several taxa {{formerly}} {{included as}} subspecies of the speckled chachalaca {{have been considered}} valid species: the scaled chachalaca (O. squamata Lesson, 1829) in south-eastern Brazil, and the East Brazilian chachalaca (O. araucuan Spix, 1825) in eastern Brazil. The last of these has also {{been referred to as}} the Brazilian chachalaca or the white-bellied chachalaca, although the former arguably is problematic as numerous other chachalacas are found in Brazil, while the latter leads to easy confusion with the Central American Ortalis leucogastra. Alternatively, [...] "araucuan" [...] and [...] "squamata" [...] have been included as subspecies of the little chachalaca (the connection between the Guiana Shield and Atlantic forest is known from several other birds, e.g. the <b>buff-throated</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> and the yellow-green grosbeak). Both O. araucuan and O. squamata were originally described as valid species, but - without reason - changed to subspecies of O. guttata. Nevertheless, they all have white scaling/spotting on the lower neck and chest, thus resembling the Amazonian nominate group (incl. [...] "subaffinis"), and most recent authorities continue to treat all as subspecies of O. guttata.|$|E
40|$|I studied song {{variation}} {{throughout the}} range of a Neotropical lowland bird species, the <b>Buff-throated</b> <b>Woodcreeper</b> (Xiphorhynchus guttatus; Aves, Dendrocolaptidae), to examine support {{for the use of}} vocal characters in defining species-limits in suboscines. This species is common across most of the lowlands of Amazonia and the Atlantic forest, its populations are separated by geographic barriers well-known in regional biogeography, and vocalizations likely used in reproductive isolation presumably are innate. I present a detailed overview of woodcreeper behavior in general and of the systematics, distribution, identification, voice, behavior, and conservation of the Xiphorhynchus guttatus superspecies in particular. Analyses of my field data revealed that this species 2 Ì† 7 song varies more than songs of most suboscines and that song variation within individuals is best quantified using the relative length of three song parts: the introduction, middle, and conclusion. Within each song part, the structure of component notes and the rate at which these notes are repeated vary little. I could best distinguish subspecies groups by differences in note structure and repetition rate. Using multivariate analysis of spectrogram parameters and the location of breakpoints separating song parts, I could place a song within a subspecies group {{with a high degree of}} certainty. Thus, song types correspond well with both subspecies groups and known centers of endemism in the region. Not only do subspecies groups have strikingly different songs, but songs differ among and within subspecies. Even different individuals within populations can be diagnosed on the basis of their songs. Early researchers reported that suboscine song does not vary geographically, but more recent quantitative studies have revealed geographic variation in the songs of at least four suboscine species. Even so, vocal differences among suboscine populations are more subtle than those in oscines, so rigorous sampling of large numbers of songs and of individuals is necessary to detect these differences. Unlike a recent study of antshrike vocalizations, geographic variation in voice is not correlated with geographic variation in genetics in the Xiphorhynchus guttatus complex. ...|$|E
