50|$|The {{centrifugal}} clutch disengages the chain {{from the engine}} when the engine is only <b>at</b> <b>idling</b> speed, engaging the drive automatically when the throttle is squeezed and the engine is at full speed. The purpose of this clutch is to avoid having a moving chain when the saw is idling and temporarily not cutting. <b>At</b> <b>idle</b> the chain should not move.|$|R

50|$|While {{a higher}} {{compression}} ratio is helpful in raising efficiency, diesel engines {{are much more}} efficient than gasoline (petrol) engines when at low power and <b>at</b> engine <b>idle.</b> Unlike the petrol engine, diesels lack a butterfly valve (throttle) in the inlet system, which closes <b>at</b> <b>idle.</b> This creates parasitic loss and destruction of availability of the incoming air, reducing the efficiency of petrol engines <b>at</b> <b>idle.</b> In many applications, such as marine, agriculture, and railways, diesels are left idling and unattended for many hours, sometimes even days. These advantages are especially attractive in locomotives (see dieselisation).|$|R

2500|$|The pilots {{retracted}} {{the landing}} gear and set flaps for go-around. The aircraft pitch changed from 2 degrees to 12 degrees as the aircraft climbed, its engines still <b>at</b> <b>idle.</b> Airspeed fell and the aircraft climbed to a maximum altitude of [...] ATL before beginning to descend. For 13 seconds the engines remained <b>at</b> <b>idle.</b> The aircraft pitch angle decreased to near 0 and then the throttle was manually increased two seconds before impact with an embankment along the runway at 15:40. The aircraft was severely damaged by a post crash fire.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{deals with}} the problem of car random burst shaking while its engine is running <b>at</b> <b>idle.</b> The {{disturbing}} vibration is excited by non-uniform engine rotational frequency that is transferred to the car body vibration and finally to passengers. Having in mind that the car structure is linear, it is possible to estimate the regression linear model for transferring vibration at individual frequencies. The paper presents how to use newly developed measurement methods and data processing tools. Key words: engine running <b>at</b> <b>idle,</b> random burst shaking, transfer path for vibration. ...|$|R

5|$|On 7 October 1964, Vulcan B.2 XM601 crashed during {{overshoot}} from an asymmetric power practice approach at Coningsby. The copilot had executed the asymmetric {{power approach}} with two engines producing thrust and two <b>at</b> <b>idle.</b> He was being checked by the Squadron Commander, who was {{unfamiliar with the}} aircraft. When he commenced the overshoot the copilot moved all the throttles to full power. The engines that had been producing power reached full power more quickly than the engines <b>at</b> <b>idle</b> and the resultant asymmetric thrust exceeded the available rudder authority, causing the aircraft to spin and crash. All the crew perished.|$|R
