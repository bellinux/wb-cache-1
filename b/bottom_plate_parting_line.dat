Note to Practitioners — Molding {{is the process of}} manufacturing a part by shaping a pliable raw material, such as molten plastic or metal, using a rigid mold. The material hardens and sets inside the mold, adopting its shape. To remove the part from the mold without destroying the mold, the mold must be made of multiple pieces. In the simplest case, a two-part mold is used, and these parts are separated in opposite directions. The curves {{on the surface of the}} part where the pieces of the mold meet are called ‘parting lines’. For a manufacturing perspective, a smooth <b>parting</b> <b>line</b> is more applicable than a theoretically correct <b>parting</b> <b>line.</b> We give a novel method to compute such a <b>parting</b> <b>line</b> in this paper.

These collectors consists of a wavelike absorbing plate and a wavelike <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> which are crosswise positioned to form the air flow channel.

For the Type 1 collector, the wavelike shape of the absorbing plate is along the flow direction and that of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> is perpendicular to the flow direction, while for the Type 2 collector it is the wavelike shape of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> that is along the flow direction and that of the absorbing plate is perpendicular to the flow direction.

For cross-corrugated collectors, the air flow channel is formed by the wavelike absorbing plate and the wavelike <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> which are transversely positioned, whereas for v-groove collectors it is formed by the v-groove absorbing plate and the flat <b>bottom</b> <b>plate.</b> The use of the transversely positioned wavelike <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> in cross-corrugated collectors is to achieve better thermal performance by enhancing the heat transfer rate inside the air flow channel via augmented turbulence. It is found that cross-corrugated collectors are superior to v-groove ones for all the configurations and operating conditions considered, confirming that the use of the transversely positioned wavelike <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> in cross-corrugated collectors improves the thermal performance. The results also show that a slender configuration along the air flow direction, a small gap between the absorbing <b>plate</b> and the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> a selected coating on the absorbing plate and the glass cover that has a very high absorptivity of solar radiation but quite a small emissivity of thermal radiation, an air mass flow rate per unit area of collector above 0. 1 kg/m 2 ·s, and maintaining the inlet fluid temperature close to that of the ambient fluid, will lead to improved thermal performance for both collectors. However, it is found that the mean gap between the cover and the absorbing plates, thexemissivity of thermal radiation of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> the solar insolation, and the inclination of the collectors have negligible effects on the efficiencies of both collectors...|$|R
