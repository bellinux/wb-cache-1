40|$|To support {{pervasive}} applications {{mobile computing}} devices often perform <b>background</b> <b>tasks,</b> such as prefetching RSS newsfeeds, that improve the userâ€™s experience but require no interactiv-ity. In {{an effort to}} conserve energy, <b>background</b> <b>tasks</b> are typically scheduled infrequently and only when a device is already in-use. The underlying assumption is that the user will need every last joule in the battery. However, {{the results of our}} four-month user study suggest that mobile devices often begin to recharge with 30 % or more of their energy remaining. The goal of this work is to utilize that excess energy to increase the frequency of <b>background</b> <b>tasks.</b> We present an online algorithm that adaptively predicts how much energy a device will have remaining at recharge and schedules self-initiated wake-up to utilize the energy for <b>background</b> <b>tasks.</b> We use the data collected by our user study to evaluate our algorithm. Our results indicate that that we can perform tasks as frequently as every 12 minutes while remaining 95 % confident that the user will recharge her device before the battery dies. ...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a novel and practical scheme, called WorkOut (I/O Workload Outsourcing), to significantly boost the performance of those low-priority <b>background</b> <b>tasks.</b> WorkOut effectively outsources all write requests and popular read requests originally targeted at the degraded RAID set that is performing the low-priority <b>background</b> <b>tasks</b> to a surrogate RAID set. The lightweight prototype implementation of WorkOut and extensive trace-driven and benchmark-driven experiments on two case studies demonstrate that, compared with existing approaches, WorkOut effectively improves {{the performance of the}} low-priority <b>background</b> <b>tasks,</b> such as RAID reconstruction and RAID resynchronization.

40|$|Poster (1 page); [URL] audienceChewing gum is a {{particular}} product, consumed during {{long periods of time}} and usually while doing something else. Therefore, traditional hedonic tests might not be giving enough information. Liking scores for three commercial mint chewing gums were collected in four groups of 50 consumers, each using a different method: A) Hedonic test after 5 minutes while performing a background task: liking scores were asked after 5 minutes of chewing while performing a <b>background</b> <b>task</b> consisting in reading a series of curious facts ("Did you know [...] . ?") on the computer screen. B) Dynamic liking with a background task: liking scores were asked every 40 seconds along a period of 10 minutes while consumers were chewing and performing the same <b>background</b> <b>task</b> as in A. Once prompted for a liking score, subjects had 5 seconds to answer. Methods A and B were innovatively done at consumers' homes using an Internet application specifically designed for the experiment. C) Interval test: liking scores were given after 1, 5 and 10 minutes of chewing. D) Traditional test: liking scores were given after the first minute of tasting. These were conducted in classical sensory lab conditions. Preference among samples was different (p< 0. 05) after the first minute (methods B, C and D). However, when at home, reading and asked only once {{in the middle of a}} standard consuming period (A), no differences were found and the highest hedonic values were obtained. Method C seemed to be discriminant, but an interesting product ranking inversion along time was only detected with dynamic at home evaluation with a <b>background</b> <b>task</b> (B). Nonetheless, method B gave the lowest scores; asking repeatedly could be forcing consumers to be over critical with the products. Results showed that techniques could be giving different and complementary information about product preference and consumer behaviour towards chewing gums...|$|E
