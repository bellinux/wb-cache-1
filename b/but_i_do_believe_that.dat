He elaborated, [...] "I don't know full details any {{more than anyone else}} does. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> in such circumstances when we are faced with someone who was manifestly a war criminal, in terms of the atrocities inflicted, it is important that justice is seen to be observed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sanders is a {{self-described}} democratic socialist, and progressive who admires the Nordic model of social democracy {{and is a}} proponent of workplace democracy. In November 2015, Sanders gave a speech at Georgetown University about his view of democratic socialism, including {{its place in the}} policies of presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson. In defining what democratic socialism means to him, Sanders said: [...] "I don't believe government should take over the grocery store down the street or own the means of production, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a decent standard of living and that their incomes should go up, not down. I do believe in private companies that thrive and invest and grow in America, companies that create jobs here, rather than companies that are shutting down in America and increasing their profits by exploiting low-wage labor abroad." [...] Based on Sanders's positions and votes throughout his political career, Noam Chomsky and Thomas Frank have described Sanders as [...] "a New Dealer".|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{know you}} would not; but never mind, and let me go on. The three of us are concerned, at any rate; you, and he, and I. I am {{thinking}} of him now. We have all suffered, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> hitherto he has had the worst of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In a way, you're right, Kendricks," [...] he agreed. [...] "You go too far, of course, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> women hold {{too big a}} {{place in}} our lives.

60|$|I do {{not believe}} that the above formal theory is untrue, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it is inadequate. It does not, for example, throw any light upon our {{preference}} for true beliefs rather than false ones. This preference is only explicable by taking account of the causal efficacy of beliefs, and of the greater appropriateness of the responses resulting from true beliefs. But appropriateness depends upon purpose, and purpose thus becomes a vital part of theory of knowledge.|$|E
60|$|But the {{enormous}} influence which has thus been exerted by the Jewish and Christian Scriptures {{has had no}} necessary connection with cosmogonies, demonologies, and miraculous interferences. Their strength lies in their appeals, not to the reason, but to the ethical sense. I do not say that even the highest biblical ideal is exclusive of others or needs no supplement. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the human race is not yet, possibly may never be, {{in a position to}} dispense with it.|$|E

Good luck to you!" ...|$|E

[...] Lady Penwether thought that her friend was hardly {{sufficiently}} thankful, and strove to tell her so in her own gentle, friendly way. But Miss Penge held her head up and was very stout, and would not acknowledge any cause for gratitude. Lady Penwether, when she saw how {{it was to be}} gave way a little. Close friendship with her future sister-in-law would be very necessary to her comfort, and Miss Penge, since the law-suit was settled, had never been given to yielding.|$|E
6000|$|... "I accept you upon trust," [...] the Duke said, [...] "for {{the sake}} of my friend Andrew. I know that he lives out of the world, and has not much {{experience}} in judging others, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> when he has {{made up his mind}} about anybody, he is generally right. Frankly, from what I have heard, and a little that I know, I am afraid that I should have been suspicious about even a child like you, because of your associates. But because I believe in you, I am all the more sure that very soon you are going to find yourself in trouble. It is agreed, remember, that when that time comes you will remember that I am your friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And so,' the M.F.H. {{was saying}} to Midmore, 'when he got to your brute Sidney's land, we had to whip 'em off. It's a regular Alsatia for 'em. They know it.
