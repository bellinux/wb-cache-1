40|$|I {{argue that}} <b>believing</b> <b>at</b> will – i. e. believing for {{practical}} reasons – {{is in some}} sense possible and in some sense impossible. It is impossible insofar as we think of belief formation as a re-sult of our exercise of certain capacities (perception, memory, agency). But insofar as we think of belief formation as an action {{that might lead to}} such a result (i. e. a deliberation or an in-quiry), <b>believing</b> <b>at</b> will is possible. First I present and clarify the problem and its philosophical relevance (section 1). I then argue that a belief formation as an immediate reaction to practical reasons is not necessarily equivalent to <b>believing</b> <b>at</b> will because the causal mechanism that leads to the formation might be deviant (section 2). Finally, I explain {{the difference between the two}} above mentioned meanings of “belief formation” in order to clarify the possibility and impossibility of <b>believing</b> <b>at</b> will (section 3) ...|$|R
25|$|Secretary of the Navy Welles {{was dismayed}} by the failure. The small {{casualty}} list, coupled with Du Pont's evident reluctance beforehand, led him to <b>believe</b> <b>at</b> first that the attack was not pressed with vigor. His criticism softened only when John Rodgers, who {{was known to be}} a thoroughly competent and aggressive officer, sided with Du Pont. As Rodgers saw it, and as Welles had to agree, Charleston could not be taken by a purely naval assault. It would require a combined operation, with full cooperation of both services, to achieve that.|$|E

25|$|Some authors {{suggest that}} an angakkuq could be honest in his tricks, {{believing in the}} {{phenomena}} he himself mimicked, moreover, he could consciously cheat and honestly <b>believe</b> <b>at</b> the same time. Knud Rasmussen mentioned Arnaqaoq, a young Netsilik Inuit living in King William Island. He smeared himself {{with the blood of}} a seal or reindeer, telling people that he had a battle with spirits. Rasmussen conjectured that he could honestly believe in this spirit battle experience which he mimicked with smearing blood. The personal impression of Rasmussen about this man was that he believed in the forces and spirits. As Rasmussen asked him to draw some pictures about his experiences, even his visions about spirits, Arnaqaoq was first unwilling to do so (having fear of the spirits). Later he accepted the task, and he spent hours to re-experience his visions, sometimes so lucidly that he had to stop drawing when his whole body began to quiver.|$|E

500|$|Vermont Representative Frederick G. Fleetwood {{addressed}} the committee. O'Reilly had indicated that coins were being requested for local celebrations, and Fleetwood {{stressed the importance}} in American history {{of the events that}} were being commemorated. Vestal and others supported a ban on the committee passing further commemorative coin bills, but wanted the Vermont bill to pass. [...] For one thing, as Massachusetts' Robert M. Leach noted, President Calvin Coolidge was a Vermonter by birth. The Treasury officials were willing to support striking a medal rather than a coin, but as Illinois' Morton D. Hull pointed out, the sellers preferred a coin that could be spent if there was an unsold surplus, over a medal that could not. Leach's attitude toward approving more commemorative coins was typical: [...] "I believe we have been going too fast, and I <b>believe</b> <b>at</b> some time we ought to quit it, but I dislike quitting on these gentlemen representing the State of Vermont this morning." [...] Vestal issued a report the same day, stating that the committee was against more commemorative coin issues, but that the Bennington issue should pass because of the national importance of the events of 1777, and because the issue of 40,000 was relatively small.|$|E
50|$|During December 2014 and January 2015, the CAA {{commissioned}} polling by YouGov {{concerning the}} attitude of the British public toward British Jews. Their polling found that 45% of British adults <b>believed</b> <b>at</b> least one of the antisemitic statements pollsters had shown them to be true, 26% <b>believed</b> <b>at</b> least two of them to be true, and 17% <b>believed</b> <b>at</b> least three of them to be true. Additionally, the polling revealed widespread fear amongst British Jews, with 45% of British Jews saying they feared they had no future in the UK and 25% saying that they had considered emigrating {{in the last two years}} due to antisemitism. The report gave various indications as to the cause of the fears, with 77% of British Jews saying that they had witnessed antisemitism disguised as a political comment about Israel.|$|R

500|$|Another major {{breakthrough}} was developing the plot twist that Prince Hans would be revealed as the film's true villain only near the end. Hans {{was not even}} in the earliest drafts, then at first was not a villain, and after becoming one, was revealed to be evil much earlier in the plot. Del Vecho said, [...] "We realized [...] was most important [...] {{if we were going to}} make the ending so surprising you had to <b>believe</b> <b>at</b> one point that Hans was the answer... he's not the answer, it's Kristoff... f you can get the audience to leap ahead and think they have figured it out you can surprise them by turning it the other way." [...] Lee acknowledged that Hans was written as [...] "sociopathic" [...] and [...] "twisted" [...] throughout the final version. For example, Hans mirrors the behavior of the other characters: [...] "He mirrors [...] and he's goofy with her... he Duke [...] is a jerk, so he's a jerk back. And with Elsa he's a hero." [...] It was difficult to lay the foundation for Anna's belated turn to Kristoff without also making Hans' betrayal of Anna too predictable, in that the audience had to [...] "feel... her feeling something but not quite understanding it... Because the minute it is [...] it deflated." [...] At one point, Anna openly flirted with Kristoff upon first meeting him, but that was changed after Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn pointed out that it would confuse and annoy viewers since Anna was already engaged to Hans.|$|E
500|$|Writer Maurice Hurley {{requested}} that {{his contributions to}} this episode appear {{under the name of}} C.J. Holland {{because of the number of}} extensive re-writes by the show's creator Gene Roddenberry. Hurley later described the situation as a [...] "misunderstanding" [...] as the situation was subsequently resolved and proved to be a turning point for the series in how scripts were produced. Subsequently Roddenberry spent less time conducting detailed re-writes. Some of the elements of Hurley's original story expanded on the back story of Q's species, explaining that there were only three Qs but another hundred thousand residents on their planet who required relocation as the planet was dying. These elements didn't subsequently make it into any future episodes. The episode marked the return of John De Lancie as Q. Cliff Bole was returning as a director for the series, and knowing that de Lancie would appear as Q, Bole watched [...] "Encounter at Farpoint" [...] in order to maintain Q's tone. He found after shooting began that his research wasn't required as de Lancie slotted back into his previous role naturally. Bole later described the episode as [...] "a lot of fun" [...] and de Lancie as [...] "a joy and a creative guy to work with". De Lancie would next return in the [...] episode [...] "Q Who". Meanwhile, the removal of the character of Deanna Troi from this episode alongside three other episodes made actress Marina Sirtis <b>believe</b> <b>at</b> the time that she was about to be cut from the show. Elaine Nalee guest starred as a female survivor, while William A. Wallace appeared as the adult Wesley Crusher.|$|E

However, until 1975 she exclusively used at in the phrase at school, leading Curtiss to <b>believe</b> <b>at</b> school was one word in her vocabulary, and Genie inconsistently understood other prepositions such as behind, over, and in front of. Curtiss wrote that on tests Genie frequently mistook both behind and in back of for in front of, though by 1977 her understanding of behind on tests had substantially improved. By contrast, on non-test settings Genie's responses to in front of, behind, in back of, and under generally indicated comprehension; unlike most children, who learn under well before the other three, she had somewhat more difficulty with under.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1831, a local horse-dealer, Antoine (Jean-Antoine) Enjolras (or Anjolras), went missing; {{a justice}} de paix (local magistrate), Étienne Filiat-Duclaux, {{determined}} that Enjolas {{had visited the}} inn on October 12, 1831, whilst looking for a lost heifer and had not been seen since. On October 25, the magistrate arrived at the Martins' to investigate the disappearance of Enjolas, whose body was found next day {{on the banks of}} the Allier River a few kilometres from the inn, his skull smashed and his knee crushed.

The Martins' servant, Jean Rochette (nicknamed [...] "Fetiche") - incorrectly described in romantic literature as a South American mulatto, but actually a (well-tanned) native of the Ardèche) - was arrested the next day.
