5|$|<b>Be</b> <b>Reasonable</b> is {{a monthly}} {{interview}} show that engages guests with ideas {{outside the mainstream}} scientific consensus, such {{as a member of}} the Flat Earth Society. In the first episode, on 28 January 2013, hosts Hayley Stevens (until June 2014) and Michael Marshall described the show as an examination of their guests' beliefs and their structure, and the evidence they believe supports these beliefs. Guests have discussed past life therapy, aura photography and the presence of aliens on Earth.|$|E
5|$|According to French Senate's Comité des Prix de Revient des {{fabrications}} d'Armement (CPRA) {{cited by}} the daily La Tribune, {{the total cost of}} the AASM program including development costs and the delivery of 2348 kits is €846m. On that basis the per-weapon cost is $300,000 or twelve times the cost of the comparable American JDAM, although the latter has been manufactured in much larger quantities (~250,000 kits) and would <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> to expect a drastic reduction of the price of the French munition if larger contracts are signed and economies of scale are achieved.|$|E
5|$|For some time, {{there had}} been concern {{about the power of}} the railroads and the way they charged {{different}} rates for different customers. In 1885, a bill to regulate the practice, authored by John Henninger Reagan, of Texas passed the House. The Reagan bill forbade discrimination in railroad or pipeline freight rates, required that rates <b>be</b> <b>reasonable,</b> and fixed maximum charges allowed. Sherman agreed with the general idea of the law, but objected to certain portions, especially a provision that gave state courts jurisdiction over enforcement disputes. Sherman believed the law should allow for more nuance as well, insisting that competition against other forms of transit be considered. These changes were adopted in the conference committee and the result, the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, owed much to Sherman's influence. Cleveland signed it into law on February 4, 1887, and appointed members to the new Interstate Commerce Commission. The act displeased the railroad industry, but was a boon to farmers and the oil industry.|$|E

50|$|The {{second stage}} is to {{establish}} whether the dismissal <b>was</b> <b>reasonable,</b> and that means whether the fair reason was sufficient to be also judged as reasonable.

25|$|The {{incident}} {{can result}} from {{a situation in which}} the perpetrator thinks they are making themselves clear, but is not understood the way they intended.

25|$|Provide {{evidence}} that the Holocaust happened, with a specific focus on the evidence for: the existence and use of gas chambers; and a co-ordinated Nazi plan, directed by Hitler, for the extermination of Jews.

25|$|HRT may <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> for the {{treatment}} of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes. It is the most effective treatment option, especially when delivered as a skin patch. Its use, however, appears to increase the risk of strokes and blood clots. When used for menopausal symptoms some recommend it be used for the shortest time possible and at the lowest dose possible. Evidence to support long term use however is poor.|$|E
25|$|WPW {{syndrome}} is treated with either medications or radiofrequency catheter ablation. It affects between 0.1 and 0.3% in the population.

In those without symptoms ongoing observation may <b>be</b> <b>reasonable.</b> In those with WPW complicated by atrial fibrillation, cardioversion or the medication procainamide may be used. The condition is named after Louis Wolff, John Parkinson, and Paul Dudley White who described the ECG findings in 1930.|$|E

The skills necessary for identifying the target and guiding weapons to it, however, may not be something HN personnel have the experience to do.|$|E
