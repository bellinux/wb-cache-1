50|$|A Small Article Monitor or SAM is a {{monitoring}} device {{designed to}} screen small items {{of up to}} 50 pounds weight for radioactive contamination. It uses six plastic scintillation detectors, one each on the top, bottom, back, left and right sides of the chamber, plus one in the door. Operation of the instrument is controlled from an integral terminal. The instrument performs a self-test and acquires a new <b>Background</b> <b>count</b> each time it is powered up. It also monitors its own operation during normal use and indicates any failures. It runs continuously, updating backgrounds whenever no weight is detected inside the chamber. A new count is initiated every time a door open/door close sequence is detected.|$|E

The samples used for measuring the <b>background</b> <b>count</b> rate were polyethylene, Teflon, quartz glass and low-potassium glass vials contained the liquid scintillator only. The <b>background</b> <b>count</b> rate of the polyethylene vial {{was found to be}} lowest among the four vials. Variation in <b>background</b> <b>count</b> rate was correlated with the concentration of 222 Rn which was strongly affected by ventilation in the laboratory. 222 Rn and its daughter nuclides giving rise to the variation in <b>background</b> <b>count</b> rate were apparently carried into the detector section not only by adsorption on the vial but also by the solution in the vial material. To reduce the effects of 222 Rn and its daughter nuclides, each vial kept in the changer section of the {{liquid scintillation counter}} was covered with a “cap”.

For Na analyses, the counting time was 4 s without a peak search but with 2 s of <b>background</b> <b>counting</b> to avoid Na loss during <b>counting.</b> The <b>background</b> corrected raw <b>counts</b> were processed using the ZAF program to obtain the oxide weight percents.|$|R

The model for the <b>background</b> <b>count</b> rate (Table  1, model 2) treated the sensitivity factor as a fixed effect and the calibration source as a random effect.

40|$|The 3 H channel <b>background</b> <b>count</b> rate of {{a liquid}} {{scintillation}} counter in Tritium Research Center, Toyama Univ. showed a daily fluctuation due to adsorption of radon and/or its daughter elements on a vial surface. To reduce and stabilize the <b>background</b> <b>count</b> rate, the following experiment was performed. Three background samples which were emulsion scintillators in 20 ml Teflon Vials, two being covered with polystyene cups, were measured for the 3 H channel count rate. The count rate of the non-insulated sample increased from 2 to 5 cpm {{and those of the}} two insulated samples were each about 1. 5 cpm less. This suggests that the vial coverage considerably reduce the <b>background</b> <b>count</b> rate. Background samples (D, E, F) having the same count rate were measured under different conditions (D: non-insulated, E: insulated by polystyrene cup, F: insulated by polystyrene cup and sponge rubber). The averaged count rate and standard deviation (± 2 s) of samples D, E, and F were 2. 71 ± 0. 88, 1. 98 ± 0. 49, 1. 96 ± 0. 33, respectively.

40|$|To {{establish}} the expected sensitivity {{of a new}} hard X-ray telescope design, an experiment was conducted to measure the <b>background</b> <b>counting</b> rate at balloon altitudes (40 km) of mercuric iodide, a room temperature solid state X-ray detector. The prototype detector consisted of two thin mercuric iodide (HgI 2) detectors surrounded by a large bismuth germanate (Bi 4 Ge 3 O 12) scintillator operated in anticoincidence. The bismuth germanate shield vetoed most of the <b>background</b> <b>counting</b> rate induced by atmospheric gamma-rays, neutrons and cosmic rays. A balloon-borne gondola containing a prototype detector assembly was designed, constructed and flown twice {{in the spring of}} 1982 from Palestine, Texas. The second flight of this instrument established a differential <b>background</b> <b>counting</b> rate of 4. 2 O. 7 x 10 - 5 counts/sec cm keV over the energy range of 40 to 80 keV. This measurement was within 50 % of the predicted value. The measured rate is approx 5 times lower than previously achieved in shielded NaI/CsI or Ge systems operating in the same energy range.

The detector parameters of working voltage, <b>background</b> <b>counting</b> rate and stability of the detector were tested, and the detection efficiency was calibrated using a standard solution of potassium chloride. Through experiment, the <b>background</b> <b>counting</b> rate of the detector is 38. 31 cps and the detection efficiency for β particles is 0. 37 cps per Bq per liter; the detector can reach its detection limit of 1. 0 Bq per liter for β particles within 100 minutes without pre-concentration...|$|R
40|$|Low-potassium glass vials {{can obtain}} reduced <b>background</b> <b>count</b> rates for beta {{particles}} in {{liquid scintillation counting}} {{with the aid of}} pulse amplitude comparisons and pulse shape analysis; they also retain relatively high counting efficiencies. Adding secondary fluor to the solvent, to shorten the pulses from sample decay events, helps the effectively separate these from the slow glass fluorescences. The power of this method in improving counting performance was examined for: 14 C in benzene in normal and low background environments using the Wallac low-level liquid scintillation counter, 1220 QuantulusTM, with an active anticoincidence guard detector. The primary fluor was 15 mg/mL butyl-PBD, and the secondary fluor was 1 mg/mL bis-MSB, 3 H in aqueous solution with commercial cocktails. In a normal environment, using Wheaton 20 mL low- 40 K vials filled with 5 mL of benzene, the best 14 C figures of merit were achieved in a window of 65 % counting efficiency. It gave a 0. 78 cpm <b>background</b> <b>count</b> rate using low bias with the pulse shape analyzer (PSA) alone and a 0. 51 cpm <b>background</b> <b>count</b> rate using the pulse amplitude comparator (PAC) in conjunction with PSA.

40|$|The INEL Lead Management Project (LMP) {{performed}} {{an investigation of}} the origin of lead used as shielding at the INEL and developed radiological profile information that was then used to establish a baseline for the DOE ``no-rad-added`` standard. Primary findings of the investigation include the following: (a) Much of the lead at the INEL was obtained from a DOE lead bank; (b) Lead inventory at the DOE lead bank was derived primarily from recycled sources and was most likely in the form of pure lead; (c) Secondary lead (lead from recycled sources), available in today`s market, is expected to have radiological characteristics {{similar to those of the}} DOE lead bank; (d) Highly sensitive radiological testing of 20 samples of lead from secondary sources revealed the lead to be radiologically pristine. Beta-, gamma-, and alpha-emitting radionuclide concentrations were all found to be less than detectable, except for a very small quantity of lead- 210 (an alpha emitter), which is a naturally occurring isotope of lead. Based on the pristine nature of lead, a proposed free release criterion for lead was developed based on a statistical null hypothesis approach. The free release criterion compares the natural <b>background</b> <b>count</b> of a clean lead standard with the natural <b>background</b> <b>count</b> of a sample.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{statistical}} analysis {{was to investigate the}} magnitudes of the components of variance of the calibration factor and to assess their impact on calibration factor variability. To do this, we used a statistical methodology that models the relationship between explanatory variables (such as SEF, radionuclide activity meter constancy, and <b>background</b> <b>count</b> rate) and dependent variables (such as CFrA and CFdA). Similarly, we studied the influence of SEF and <b>background</b> <b>count</b> rate on the measured calibration source count rate, as well as the impact of SEF on the <b>background</b> <b>count</b> rate. We used a mixed-effects model [14] where some explanatory variables were modeled as fixed effects and some as random effects. A fixed effect is one where there is a functional relationship between the explanatory variable and quantity of interest; in this work, we assumed the relationship to be linear. For example, we assumed that there was a linear relationship between the camera sensitivity factor and the calibration factor for reasons described below. A random effect is one where the contribution from that variable for a particular measurement is a sample of a random variable; in this work, all the random variables were assumed to have zero-mean normal distributions with unknown variances.|$|E
