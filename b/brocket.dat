5|$|Fauna is {{similarly}} distributed, with distinct altitudinal zonation present. The highest altitudes support the endangered mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque), cougar (Puma concolor), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), and Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus). Lower down, the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), <b>brocket</b> deers (Mazama sp.), vulnerable northern pudú (Pudu mephistophiles), and endangered giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) {{can all be}} found. Bird species common in the area include the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), Andean cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus), giant hummingbird (Patagona gigas), torrent duck (Merganetta armata), king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), and swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus).|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{have revealed that}} the diet of the inhabitants of Motul de San José included dogs (Canis familiaris), turtles including pond sliders (Trachemys scripta) and Mesoamerican river turtles (Dermatemys mawii), freshwater snails (mostly Pomacea flagellata but also jute snails (Pachychilus spp.)), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red <b>brocket</b> (Mazama americana, a species of small deer), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), lowland pacas (Cuniculus paca), Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) and nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). Only the dog had been domesticated by the Late Classic Maya so the majority of protein in the diet of the inhabitants came from hunting and fishing within the catchment area around the city. The most common food animals were the white-tailed deer, river clam and river turtle. Some animal remains were recovered that were clearly associated with elite status occupation, {{such as those of}} the jaguar, the ocelot or other small feline and the crocodile (crocodilus spp.). These latter three appear more related to ritual and economic activity than nutritional needs. Freshwater snails were more an ingredient in the diet of lower status families while deer remains were associated with the elite residents of the city.|$|E
50|$|Gray <b>brockets</b> {{are active}} during the day, but {{generally}} only {{appear in the}} open at night. They are solitary and territorial, with the male defending a larger territory and the female a smaller core area.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the green monkeys, which roam freely {{in and out of}} the fenced enclosure, the wildlife reserve also keeps a variety of other animals, many of which roam the reserve freely without separation from visitors.

Mammals include white-tailed deer, red <b>brockets,</b> collared peccaries, agouti, kinkajous, white-faced capuchin monkeys, mantled howler monkeys, Hoffmann's two-toed sloths and brown-throated three-toed sloths. However, mammals can be difficult to see due to the dense tree cover.|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{communication}} is intensely used by deer, especially scent-marking behaviors, with territory marking mainly made by males. This work presents several video recordings {{of at least}} two gray <b>brockets</b> (male and female) chemically communicating via scent marks. Video recordings demonstrate multiple depositions of feces and urine by the animals, probably for the development of intrasexual interaction and, secondarily, territorial marks. The chemical communication observed is possibly related to reproduction or intraspecific competition for resources. These territorial marks are particularly important for avoiding intraspecific competition for resources and sexual partners...|$|R
50|$|Its body is reddish-brown in color, with {{a lighter}} grayish-brown head and neck, and {{partially}} blackish legs. The inner thighs and {{the underside of}} the tail are white. Fawns are spotted white and lack blackish to the legs. Only the adult male has antlers, and these are small and spike-like. This species is the largest of the <b>brockets.</b> The shoulder height is 67 - 80 cm and the head and body length 105 - 144 cm. These deer typically weigh 24 - 48 kg, but exceptional males may get as large as 65 kg.|$|R
25|$|At <b>Brocket</b> Hall, Lady Mount Stephen {{frequently}} {{entertained the}} Prince (the future Edward VII) and Princess of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of Connaught and the Duchess of Teck. She introduced the canoe to Scotland while living at Faskally, Perthshire and fished {{with her husband}} in Canada and the rivers of Scotland. She died in London on 10 April 1896, and was buried in Lemsford Churchyard, adjoining <b>Brocket</b> Hall.

50|$|A {{different}} fable {{appeared in}} prose in Robert Dodsley's Select Fables of Esop (1764). This, however, was {{an adaptation of}} the fable of The Gourd and the Palm-tree and appeared in the book's third section of 'modern fables'. There the pert vine refused the elm's proposal and boasted {{of being able to}} rely on its own resources. The elm replies to the 'poor infatuated shrub' that misapplication of its resources will soon bring about its downfall. The text was reissued in a 1776 edition of Dodsley's work illustrated by Thomas Bewick and again in John <b>Brocket's</b> Select Fables (Newcastle 1820), also with Bewick's woodcut.|$|R
5000|$|In the 19th {{century the}} town was called [...] "Goat Creek", after a creek {{at the base of}} nearby Goat Peak (then called Goat Mountain). When the former post office was secured in 1899, the {{settlers}} chose a name they thought was Greek for [...] "mountain goat". They later discovered that they had looked in the wrong dictionary and, according to Edmond S. Meany, the meaning of [...] "Mazama" [...] was [...] "mountain goat" [...] in Spanish, not Greek. [...] Mazama is a genus of deer (family Cervidae) comprising the <b>Brockets,</b> medium to small deer that are found in the Americas. The genus name Mazama is derived from Nahuatl mazame, the plural of mazatl [...] "deer."Locally, the name is pronounced to rhyme with [...] "Alabama": [...] This {{is not the same as}} Oregon’s Mount Mazama, pronounced with a broader central vowel: [...]|$|R
50|$|Molecular dating {{suggests}} that the family Cervidae originated and radiated in central Asia during the Late Miocene, and that the Odocoileini dispersed to North America during the Miocene/Pliocene boundary, and underwent an adaptive radiation in South America after their Pliocene dispersal across the Isthmus of Panama. According to the systematic relationships and evolutionary history of Neotropical deer, at least eight ancestral forms of deer invaded South America during the late Pliocene (2.5-3 Mya), {{and members of the}} red <b>brockets</b> had an independent early explosive diversification soon after their ancestor arrived there, giving rise to a number of morphologically cryptic species. Deer endemic to the New World fall in two biogeographic lineages: the first one groups Odocoileus and Mazama americana is distributed in North, Central, and South America, whereas the second one is composed of South American species only and includes Mazama gouazoubira. This implies that the genus Mazama is not a valid taxon. Genetic analysis revealed high levels of molecular and cytogenetic divergence between groups of morphologically similar species of <b>brockets</b> (Mazama), and suggest a polyphyletic origin. In particular, M. americana showed a striking relationship with several sequences of Odocoileus in contrast to that expected, since this M. americana (now M. temama) haplotype, from a Mexican origin, was not associated with several Bolivian Mazama sequences analyzed. This could put forward that this genera is not monophyletic. However, these Bolivian Mazama species formed a clade with Pudu puda and Ozotoceros bezoarticus. Likely, an Odocoileus virginianus sequence from the central area of Colombia showed a stronger relationship with a North American O. heminonus sequence than with the other O. virginianus sequences of Colombian origin, as well. This could be explained by various hypotheses. The first is the existence of common ancestral haplotypes between both species. Another is the reiterative hybridization among both Odocoileus species before the migration of O. virginianus from North America to South America.|$|R
25|$|The Belize Zoo {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of mammals, {{including}} Belize's national animal, the Baird's tapir, and the five wildcat species found in Belize: (jaguar, puma, ocelot, margay, and jaguarundi).

25|$|Larger {{terrestrial}} mammals {{have varied}} strategies {{of dealing with}} flooding: red <b>brocket</b> deer and collared peccaries move into islands and shift diet from fruit to browsing woody plants. White-lipped peccaries and tapirs are largely unaffected by seasonal inundation; both species {{take advantage of the}} greater abundance of fruit during these times. White-lipped peccaries migrate between flooded and dry areas and tapirs are highly capable swimmers.|$|E
25|$|Gian Mount Stephen {{was said}} to have {{preferred}} the life at <b>Brocket</b> Hall to the social life that surrounded their city residence on Carlton House Terrace.

25|$|Ultimately, it was Lady Caroline who prevailed on {{her husband}} {{to agree to a}} formal {{separation}} in 1825. Both parties had had numerous extramarital affairs by that time and Lamb had long been known to eschew duplicity. She took up permanent residence at <b>Brocket</b> Hall. Her struggle with mental instability became more pronounced in her last years, complicated by her abuse of alcohol and laudanum. By 1827, she was under the care of a full-time physician as her body, which had always been frail, began to shut down and she retained fluids (a condition then known as dropsy, and now known as oedema). William Lamb was Chief Secretary for Ireland by that time and made a perilous crossing to be by her side when Lady Caroline died on 25 January 1828.|$|E
