Although the exploration of values of <b>big</b> spectrum <b>data</b> is still in infancy, it is well believed that <b>big</b> spectrum <b>data</b> will bring a more comprehensive picture of spectrum usage and much {{deeper understanding of the}} patterns of spectrum state evolution [17]. Among many other, several representative applications of <b>big</b> spectrum <b>data</b> include (i) comprehensive and accurate modeling of spectrum usage patterns in the time, space, and frequency dimensions [46]; (ii) deep and long-term prediction or inference of spectrum evolution to enable efficient spectrum usage by looking into the future [47 – 50]; (iii) informative spectrum recommendation, just as Amazon provides successful product (e.g., books) recommendation for its consumers, <b>big</b> spectrum <b>data</b> can also be exploited to recommend preferable spectrum bands to users or operators in dynamic spectrum market according to their historical behaviors and preferences of spectrum usage; and (iv) effective and fine spectrum management by utilizing both real-time and statistical information on spectrum usage to enable dynamic spectrum assignment and smart interference management.|$|R

This paper {{defines the}} Field <b>data</b> type for <b>big</b> spatial <b>data.</b> Most <b>big</b> spatial <b>data</b> sets provide {{information}} about properties of real-ity in continuous way, which leads to their representation as fields. We develop a generic data type for fields that can represent di↵erent types of spatiotemporal data, such as trajectories, time series, remote sensing and, climate data. To assess its power of generality, we show how to rep-resent existing algebras for spatial data with the Fields data type. The paper also argues that array databases are the best support for processing <b>big</b> spatial <b>data</b> and shows {{how to use the}} Fields data type with array databases...|$|R
