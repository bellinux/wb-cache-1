5000|$|The phrase [...] "brown {{paper bag}} test", {{also known as}} a paper bag party, along with the [...] "ruler test" [...] refers to a ritual once {{practice}}d by certain African-American sororities and fraternities who would not let anyone into the group whose skin tone was darker than a paper <b>bag.</b> <b>Spike</b> Lee's film School Daze satirized this practice at historically black colleges and universities. [...] Along with the [...] "paper bag test", guidelines for acceptance among the lighter ranks included the [...] "comb test" [...] and [...] "pencil test", which tested the coarseness of one's hair, and the [...] "flashlight test", which tested a person's profile to make sure their features measured up or were close enough to those of the Caucasian race.|$|E

50|$|Even {{before their}} player-manager feud, Leonard and Cobb had a history. In 1914, Leonard hit Cobb {{in the ribs}} with a fastball. In the next at bat, Cobb dragged a bunt which the Red Sox first baseman was forced to field; as Leonard's foot landed on the <b>bag,</b> Cobb's foot, <b>spikes</b> and all, landed on Leonard's, drawing blood.|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} mode of {{inheritance}} and mapping of fertility restorer (Rf) gene(s) using {{simple sequence repeat}} (SSR) markers was conducted in a cross of male sterile line 2041 A having Triticum timopheevi cytoplasm and a restorer line PWR 4099 of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The F 1 hybrid was completely fertile indicating that fertility restoration is a dominant trait. Based on the pollen fertility and seed set of <b>bagged</b> <b>spikes</b> in F 2 generation, the individual plants were classified into fertile and sterile groups. Out of 120 F 2 plants, 97 were fertile and 23 sterile (based on pollen fertility) while 98 plants set ≥ 5 seeds/spike and 22 produced ≤ 4 or no seed. The observed frequency fits well into Mendelian ratio of 3 fertile: 1 sterile with χ 2 value of 2. 84 for pollen fertility and 2. 17 for seed setting indicating that the fertility restoration is governed by a single dominant gene in PWR 4099. The three linked SSR markers, Xwmc 503, Xgwm 296 and Xwmc 112 located on the chromosome 2 DS were {{placed at a distance}} of 3. 3, 5. 8 and 6. 7 cM, respectively, from the Rf gene. Since, no known Rf gene is located on the chromosome arm 2 DS, the Rf gene in PWR 4099 is a new gene and proposed as Rf 8. The closest SSR marker, Xwmc 503, linked to the Rf 8 was validated in a set of Rf, maintainer and cytoplasmic male sterile lines. The closely linked SSR marker Xwmc 503 may be used in marker-assisted backcross breeding facilitating the transfer of fertility restoration gene Rf 8 into elite backgrounds with ease...|$|R
30|$|The {{seeds of}} DMSW line DS 987 were {{planted in the}} {{greenhouse}} with a photoperiod of 14  h light/ 10  h darkness and a temperature regime of 25 °C day/ 15 °C night. Once {{the heads of the}} male sterile plants were just completed out of the sheaths of the flag leaves, the spikes were prepared by removing the up and down spikelets and the middle florets of each remaining spikelet, and cutting the top part of the lemmas of each floret with scissors. Then, the prepared <b>spikes</b> were <b>bagged</b> with sulfuric acid paper. Three days later, the <b>bagged</b> <b>spikes</b> were pollinated with the pollens of the two maize lines by pouring {{from the top of the}} bags with hand shaking. On the next 2  days, the pollinated spikes were treated with 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) 100  mg L- 1 containing solution for 2 times (Chen et al. 1996 a; Chen et al. 1996 b). 14 – 15  days post pollination, the immature grains were collected and sterilized with 70 % ethanol for 1  min, immersed in 20 % bleach for 15  min and rinsed with sterile distilled water for five times inside laminar flow bench. The immature embryos were isolated with inoculating needle under anatomical lens and cultured in axial side up on germination medium (pH  6.0) containing 1 / 2 Murashige and Skoog (1962) (MS) basal salts, 2.0 % sucrose, B 5 vitamins, and 2.4  g L- 1 phytagel at conditions of 25 [*]±[*] 1 °C, 16  h photoperiod, 400  μmol m- 2  s- 1 photosynthetic photon flux density and 45 % relative humidity for 4 wk to obtain healthy haploid plantlets (Chen et al. 1996 b, 2013). Finally, the plantlets were transplanted in soil in natural environment condition for further investigation. Test of percent hypothesis was used to evaluate the difference of corn inducer and normal inbred lines on inducing wheat haploid plants.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Effective {{chemical}} control of pollination {{would provide an}} alternative to the cytoplasmic male-sterile system in hybrid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine concentration, formulation, growth stage of application and genotypic effects on levels of induced pollen suppression and subsequent natural out-crossing from foliar applications of promising Chemical Hybridization Agents (CHA's). Effective concentration ranges for each CHA were determined in preliminary trials. Growth stages of application were made at 1. 5 cm to 2. 5 cm mean primordia (spike) length of most advanced tillers. Effective treatments were observed from both high and low concentrations and both growth stages of application with different CHA's. With specific concentrations and stages of application, ten of thirteen CHA's resulted in both high mean sterility (94 - 99. 8 percent) relative to <b>bagged</b> control <b>spikes</b> and high plot grain yields (44. 0 to 73. 4 percent) relative to control mean plot yield. In some cases, highest CHA concentrations resulted in higher phytotoxicity and subsequent reduced grain yield suggesting some reduced female fertility and/or receptivity. Chemical Hybridization agents were subject to only small modifications with different formulations. Formulations which resulted in higher mean sterility also resulted in higher plant phytotoxicity, lower grain yield, and were generally effective at lower concentrations. Large differences in genotype response were observed with a single concentration application of four CHA candidates. Concentrations high enough to induce high sterility (> 95...|$|R
50|$|Spike and Tyke {{walk into}} the {{backyard}} to have a barbecue. The first attempt fails because the charcoal blows up. On the second attempt, Spike puts on too much charcoal on the barbecue, the result which lets of a cloud of dark smoke when Spike blows into the charcoal to get the fire going (which results in the smoke literally making Spike's eyes red and watery). He however claims this to his son that a bit of Hickory smoke always keeps in good barbecue flavour. On the third attempt, Spike causes the steak to instantly be burnt to a crisp. Spike retrieves another steak, but this time Tom and Jerry have {{appeared on the scene}} with Tom chasing Jerry as usual. Jerry repeatedly hides in items involved in the barbecue: the <b>bag</b> of charcoal, <b>Spike's</b> hat, the salad, the shakers, and the bread. This means every time that Tom pursues Jerry when he's interfering with the barbecue. In this happens, Spike furiously chases Tom off, which Tom could end up in the swimming pool.|$|R
5000|$|Yannick Fonsat (born June 16, 1988 in Paris, France) is a French {{sprinter}} who specialises in the 400 meters. He was the 2007 European Junior Champion at 400 metres. As French junior champion, {{he had run}} at the 2006 World Junior Championships in Athletics, but didn't {{make the}} finals. During the 2007 Indoor season, he set the French Junior record and ran with the senior 4x400 metres team at the 2007 European Athletics Indoor Championships. He was selected for the 2009 World Championships in Athletics - Men's 400 metres, {{but was unable to}} run after the <b>bag</b> containing his <b>spikes</b> were stolen. Finding a replacement a few days later, he ran on the French relay team where he came out of his exchange in dead last place, his final kick passed three other teams and brought France into close contention though they finished in seventh place. Fonsat won the 400m bronze medal at the 2012 European Championships. [...] He had also competed at the 2010 and 2014 editions but was unable to reach the finals.|$|R
40|$|Marine surface sediments, {{which are}} replete with sulfate, are {{typically}} {{considered to be}} devoid of endogenous methanogenesis. Yet, methanogenic archaea are present in those sediments, suggesting a potential for methanogenesis. We used an isotope dilution method based on sediment <b>bag</b> incubation and <b>spiking</b> with 13 C-CH 4 to quantify CH 4 turnover rates in sediment from Aarhus Bay, Denmark. In two independent experiments, highest CH 4 production and oxidation rates (> 200 pmol cm- 3 d- 1) {{were found in the}} top 0 – 2 cm, below which rates dropped below 100 pmol cm- 3 d- 1 in all other segments down to 16 cm. This drop in overall methane turnover with depth was accompanied by decreasing rates of organic matter mineralization with depth. Molecular analyses based on quantitative PCR and MiSeq sequencing of archaeal 16 S rRNA genes showed that the abundance of methanogenic archaea also peaked in the top 0 – 2 cm segment. Based on the community profiling, hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogens dominated among the methanogenic archaea in general, suggesting that methanogenesis in surface sediment could be driven by both CO 2 reduction and fermentation of methylated compounds. Our results show the existence of elevated methanogenic activity and a dynamic recycling of CH 4 at low concentration in sulfate-rich marine surface sediment. Considering the common environmental conditions found in other coastal systems, we speculate that such a cryptic methane cycling can be ubiquitous...|$|R
