[...] Juju explained the title of the song as relating to the point in a relationship where [...] "you don't want a happy ending, and there is no future, where you want to stop spending time together, immediately." [...] During recording and performances of the song, Juju felt it easy to imagine the feelings of the song's protagonist. Her favorite section of the song is the bridge (the section beginning with the lyrics amai kako no kioku nante).|$|E

2500|$|Bush favors {{repealing}} the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or [...] "Obamacare") {{and replacing it}} with a [...] "market-oriented" [...] alternative. Bush has called the current law a [...] "monstrosity" [...] that is [...] "flawed to its core." [...] Bush has proposed some sort of state- or local-government funded [...] "catastrophic coverage" [...] system, in which [...] "if you have a hardship that goes way <b>beyond</b> <b>your</b> means of paying for it, ... the government is there or an entity is there to help you deal with that."

2500|$|SST {{issued the}} Minutemen's debut EP Paranoid Time as its second release in 1980. The songs were {{recorded}} and mixed {{in a single}} night for $300. Minutemen bassist Mike Watt recalled, [...] "It {{was at that point}} we realized {{all you had to do}} was pay for the pressings, that records weren't a gift from Mount Olympus [...] [...] [...] Maybe it was from Greg's experience with ham radios, but he believed if you try, you can get things <b>beyond</b> <b>your</b> little group." [...] Facing hostility towards hardcore punk, SST groups like Black Flag and the Minutemen played wherever they could, mainly at house parties and in basements early on. Black Flag began traveling up the California coast to play Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco, making seven trips in total. SST house record producer Spot went along as sound-man and tour manager, a job he would perform for several years, along with helping to record much of the label's music.|$|E
2500|$|In its Confirmation exegesis, the Minnehaha United Methodist Church of Minneapolis, Minnesota notes,Metanoia is used {{to refer}} to the change of mind which is brought about in repentance. Repentance is {{necessary}} and valuable because it brings about change of mind or metanoia. This change of mind will make the changed person hate sin and love God. The two terms (repentance and metanoia) are often used interchangeably. [...] "Meta-" [...] is additionally used to imply [...] "beyond" [...] and [...] "outside of." [...] E.g., ...metaphysics as outside the limits of physics. The word metanoia has taken on an in-vogue usage among interfaith dialogues as simply meaning [...] "a change of heart." [...] Though this is close to its Christian theological meaning, perhaps one may conclude that metanoia is [...] "taking one's mind/thoughts beyond and outside of one's habituations." [...] Yes, English translators of the Christian Scriptures fail to find a proper corresponding word for metanoia, so they fall back upon the comfort and ease of the word repent. Yet repent carries with it a negative tone, almost an inhibition caused by guilt; metanoia forces a positive, proactive life-affirming response. When Jesus calls people to [...] "repent," [...] to [...] "metanoia," [...] could it be that he means: [...] "Change your thought processes and go <b>beyond</b> <b>your</b> mind's present state of limitations"? Does this not mandate self-assessment and interpersonal acceptance? ...|$|E

2500|$|The plateau {{area has}} a subarctic climate and only {{supports}} sparse tundra. The shattered terrain {{is more like}} the high ground in high-arctic Canada or northern Norway than anywhere in the Alps or Rockies. The weather often deteriorates rapidly with altitude so that, when there are moderate conditions 150 metres below the plateau, the top can be stormy or misty and there can be icy or powdery snow. Even when no snow is falling the wind can whip up lying snow to produce white-out conditions for a few metres above the surface and snowdrifts can build up rapidly in sheltered places. Gravel can be blown {{through the air and}} walking can be impossible. Adam Watson says [...] "When a gale is accompanied by thick storms of ground drift, or worse, by heavy falling blizzards plus ground drift, or worse still by mist as well, conditions can be extremely serious on the plateau, making it suffocating and difficult to breathe, hard to open your eyes, impossible to see anything <b>beyond</b> <b>your</b> own feet, and unable to communicate with your party except one at a time by cupping an ear and shouting into it." [...] In January 1993 a wind speed of [...] was measured at Cairngorm summit weather station – the greatest speed ever recorded in the UK.|$|E
