She worked closely with Graça Machel-Mandela, the South African first lady, advocating for children suffering from HIV/AIDS, child soldiers, and the physically handicapped. She established the Makeba Centre for Girls, a home for orphans, described in an obituary as her most personal project. She also took part in the 2002 documentary , which examined the struggles of <b>black</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> against apartheid through the music of the period. Makeba's second autobiography, Makeba: The Miriam Makeba Story, was published in 2004. In 2005 she announced that she would retire and began a farewell tour, but despite having osteoarthritis, continued to perform until her death. During this period, her grandchildren Nelson Lumumba Lee and Zenzi Lee, and her great-grandchild Lindelani, occasionally joined her performances.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, President F.W. de Klerk started {{negotiations}} to end apartheid in South Africa with Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC). During negotiation, the white South African Rugby Board and the non-racial South African Rugby Union merged {{to create the}} South African Rugby Football Union. Rugby {{at the time was}} seen by <b>black</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> as a symbol of white supremacy. The ANC demanded that the new SARFU improve development of black players. This was because the Springboks team consisted solely of white players at the time, though black players were eligible for selection for the Springboks following the merger of the two governing bodies. Following the yes vote in the South African apartheid referendum in March 1992, the IRB lifted restrictions on tours of South Africa. It was announced that the return test would be against New Zealand. This was criticised in South Africa as the Springboks had not played full international rugby for 11 years and it was felt it would not be competitive however New Zealand were invited because it was felt appropriate after the events around the 1981 South Africa rugby union tour.|$|E

25|$|The {{association}} of Afrikaans with apartheid prompted <b>black</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> to prefer English. Even the Bantustan regimes chose English and an indigenous African language as official languages. In addition, English was gaining prominence as the language {{most often used}} in commerce and industry. The 1974 decree was intended to forcibly reverse the decline of Afrikaans among black Africans. The Afrikaner-dominated government used the clause of the 1909 Union of South Africa Act that recognised only English and Dutch (the latter being replaced by Afrikaans in 1925) as official languages as the pretext to do so. While all schools had to provide instruction in both Afrikaans and English as languages, white South African students learned other subjects in their home language.|$|E

As <b>black</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> organized to try to achieve civil rights and social justice, government repression increased.

In September 1990, he controversially compared Myra Hindley's continuing imprisonment to the long sentence that Nelson Mandela served for his part in the anti-Apartheid activities of <b>black</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africans,</b> claiming that Myra Hindley was being kept in prison longer than necessary to serve the interests of successive Home Secretaries and their governments.

Lloyd George misled the House of Commons in claiming that Haig's forces were stronger (1.75 million men) at the start of 1918 than they had been a year earlier (1.5 million men) - in fact the increase was caused by an increase of 335,000 in the number of labourers (many of them Chinese, Indians and <b>black</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africans),</b> and Haig had fewer combat infantry (630,000, down from 900,000 a year earlier), holding a longer stretch of front (the rest of Haig's men would have been tank, air & artillery crews and above all logistical support personnel). Although Maurice - who certainly collaborated with Robertson - visited Haig shortly before his press letter, there is no specific evidence that Haig collaborated with his actions. Haig wrote to his wife that he had opposed Maurice in taking his concerns into public, but he was privately disappointed at how Lloyd George was able to get off the hook with a “claptrap speech”. Maurice believed he had saved Haig from dismissal.|$|E

2500|$|In {{areas in}} and around Cape Town, netball was a {{favourite}} sport for coloured schools to have {{because it was the}} cheapest one to play.

40|$|Previous work showed high {{agreement}} in facial attractiveness preferences {{within and across}} cultures. The aims {{of the current study}} were twofold. First, we tested cross-cultural {{agreement in}} the attractiveness judgements of White Scottish and <b>Black</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> students for own- and other-ethnicity faces. Results showed significant agreement between White Scottish and <b>Black</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> observers' attractiveness judgements, providing further evidence of strong cross-cultural agreement in facial attractiveness preferences. Second, we tested whether cross-cultural agreement is influenced by the ethnicity and/or the gender of the target group. White Scottish and <b>Black</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> observers showed significantly higher agreement for Scottish than for African faces, presumably because both groups are familiar with White European facial features, but the Scottish group are less familiar with Black African facial features. Further work investigating this discordance in cross-cultural attractiveness preferences for African faces show that <b>Black</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> observers rely more heavily on colour cues when judging African female faces for attractiveness, while White Scottish observers rely more heavily on shape cues. Results also show higher cross-cultural agreement for female, compared to male faces, albeit not significantly higher.
