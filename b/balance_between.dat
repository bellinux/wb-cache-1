5|$|Innis {{argued that}} a <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> the spoken word and writing contributed to the flourishing of ancient Greece {{in the time of}} Plato. This <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> the time-biased medium of speech and the space-biased medium of writing was {{eventually}} upset, Innis argued, as the oral tradition gave way to the dominance of writing. The torch of empire then passed from Greece to Rome.|$|E
5|$|Western civilization {{could only}} be saved, Innis argued, by {{recovering}} the <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> space and time. For him, that meant reinvigorating the oral tradition within universities while freeing {{institutions of higher learning}} from political and commercial pressures. In his essay, A Plea for Time, he suggested that genuine dialogue within universities could produce the critical thinking necessary to restore the <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> power and knowledge. Then, universities could muster the courage to attack the monopolies that always imperil civilization.|$|E

5|$|Originating in German soil today Riesling is Germany’s leading grape variety, {{known for}} its {{characteristic}} “transparency” in flavour and presentation of terroir, and its <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> fruit and mineral flavours.

5|$|The ideal he {{expressed}} in a work of the period, Equilibru între antithesi ("A <b>Balance</b> <b>between</b> Antitheses") was moderate progressivism, with the preservation of social peace. In Tudor Vianu's view, partly based on earlier assessments by other critics, Equilibru, with its stress on making political needs coincide with social ones through the means of counterweights, evidenced strong influences from Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's thought, as well as vaguer ones from that of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Nonetheless, his system parted with Hegelianism in that, instead of seeking a <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> the Geist and existence, it considered the three states of human progress (Thesis, antithesis, synthesis) the reflection of a mystical number favored throughout history.|$|E
5|$|The new {{commissioner}} {{spent the}} second half of 1906 attending ICC hearings around the country. The Hepburn Act had given the Commission broad powers over the railroads, and the Commission worked to deal not only with past railroad abuses, but to strike a <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> the desires of railroads and those of shippers.|$|E

5|$|The {{price for}} pure bismuth metal has been {{relatively}} stable {{through most of the}} 20th century, except for a spike in the 1970s. Bismuth has always been produced mainly as a byproduct of lead refining, and thus the price usually reflected the cost of recovery and the <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> production and demand.|$|E

5|$|After the Ottoman army left Wallachia, Vlad offered Albert of Habsburg {{to set the}} burghers who {{had been}} {{captured}} at Sebeș free, but the king (who regarded them traitors) refused his offer. Vlad's attempts to maintain a <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> Hungary and the Ottomans made both the king and the sultan suspicious about his true intentions. Albert allowed a pretender to the Wallachian throne, Basarab (who was a son of Dan II) to settle in Hungary. The Ottomans strengthened the fortress of Giurgiu and sent new troops to garrison the town.|$|E
5|$|Baldur's Gate II {{is set in}} {{the year}} 1369 DR (Dale Reckoning), and thus takes place not long after the Time of Troubles (1358 DR), when the Tablets of Fate, {{powerful}} magic items which maintain a <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> good and evil, were stolen. Lord Ao, the Overdeity, forced the gods to become mortal until the Tablets were found; some gods died while in this mortal state.|$|E

Coon emphasized a <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> the shop and the classroom. Coon taught his students more modern quantification methods to solve engineering problems instead of outdated and more costly trial and error methods. He also {{played a significant role in}} developing mechanical engineering into a professional degree program, with a focus on ethics, design and testing, analysis and problem solving, and mathematics.|$|E

5|$|In an animal, {{cells are}} {{constantly}} dying. A <b>balance</b> <b>between</b> cell division and cell death keeps {{the number of}} cells relatively constant in adults. There are two different ways a cell can die: by necrosis or by apoptosis. In contrast to necrosis, which often results from disease or trauma, apoptosis—or programmed cell death—is a normal healthy function of cells. The body has to rid itself of millions of dead or dying cells every day, and phagocytes {{play a crucial role}} in this process.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, unbearably {{inadequate}} {{housing and}} overcrowded neighborhoods pushed working {{men out of}} the home and into saloons where they congregated for drink and discussion.

George Pullman and William Halliday implemented a policy of tolerance in their towns identical to that of Robert Owen. The peaceful atmosphere in Pullman and Hallidayboro can be attributed in part to the absence of alcohol.|$|E
