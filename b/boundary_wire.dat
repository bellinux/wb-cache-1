40|$|Geometric measure {{theory is}} an area of {{analysis}} concerned with solving geometric problems via measure theoretic techniques. The canonical motivating physical problem is probably that investigated experimentally by Plateau in the nineteenth century [3]: given a <b>boundary</b> <b>wire,</b> how does one find the (minimal) soap film which spans it? Slightly more mathematically, given a boundary curve, find the surface of minimal area spanning it. The many different approaches to solving this problem have found utility in most areas of modern mathematics and geometric measure theory is no exception: techniques and ideas from geometric measure theory have been found useful in the study of partial differential equations, the calculus of variations, harmonic analysis, and fractals. Successes in the field include: classifying the structure of singularities in soap films (see [18], together with the fine descriptive article [4]); showing that the standard ‘double bubble ’ is the optimal shape for enclosing two prescribed volumes in space [13], and developing powerful computer software for modelling the evolution of surfaces under the action of physical forces [7]...|$|E
30|$|Generally, {{the optical}} {{response}} of a metamaterial {{is determined by}} its geometrical properties: size, connectivity and shape of its metallic elements. In fact, for chiral metamaterials, we can list important factors that determine chirality parameters such as: (i) the helicity of metallic elements (straight or helical), (ii) the relative orientation of the metallic elements, (iii) the connectivity over the cell <b>boundary</b> (<b>wire</b> or cut-wire), and (iv) the connectivity between metallic elements inside a unit cell. From these criteria, we can estimate the optical response of chiral metamaterials, the refractive index and chirality parameters. Firstly, the helicity of the constituent metallic elements in a unit cell is directly associated with the strength of chirality of the medium since it determines how the magnetisation is induced by the electric currents flowing through the metallic elements (wires, plates) and how electric polarisation is generated by electric charges in the metallic elements. For example, the chirality parameter of a helical medium has a strong dependence on the radius of helices, radius of the wires and the pitch of the helices [37]. Some insightful guidelines {{can be found in}} [20]. Secondly, the relative orientation of the metallic elements strongly affects the resulting Coulomb interactions and electric polarisation allowing changes to the optical activity and circular dichroism. Theoretical model for chiral metallic nanoparticle assemblies can be found in [38]. Thirdly, the connectivity of wires determine the types of electrical resonances, whether its spectra is Lorentzian or Drude. For example, the connected wire mesh array shows Drude type electrical behaviour since the electrons in the wire can move freely in response to the external electric fields, while in disconnected wires, called cut-wire arrays, the electrons are stopped at the end of metallic wires resulting in Lorentzian resonances. Therefore, chiral metamaterials with helical wires [39] show a Drude type spectral response and they can be analysed using the tri-helical model [37]. Lastly, the connectivity inside a unit cell makes the chirality weaker by making current routes of different chirality. The gyroid {{is a good example of}} weakened chirality resulting from the connection between metallic elements (see Section 2.4. 2 for details) [40]. For an achiral connected wire array metamaterial, the effect of connectivity has been investigated [41], explaining a drastic change in optical parameters of metamaterials.|$|E

50|$|Several {{physical}} reasons {{predict that}} the conductivity of a nanowire will be much {{less than that of}} the corresponding bulk material.

40|$|We {{study the}} motion of {{magnetic}} skyrmions in a nanowire induced by a spin-wave current J flowing out of a driving layer {{close to the edge}} of the wire. By applying micromagnetic simulation and an analysis of the effective Thiele equation, we find that the skyrmion trajectory is governed by an interplay of both forces due to the magnon current and the <b>wire</b> <b>boundary.</b> The skyrmion is attracted to the driving layer and is accelerated by the repulsive force due to the <b>wire</b> <b>boundary.</b> We consider both cases of a driving longitudinal and transverse to the nanowire, but a steady-state motion of the skyrmion is only obtained for a transverse magnon current. For the latter case, we find in the limit of low current densities J the velocity-current relation v ∼ J/α where v is the skyrmion velocity and α is the Gilbert damping. For large J in case of strong driving, the skyrmion is pushed into the driving layer resulting in a drop of the skyrmion velocity and, eventually, the destruction of the skyrmion.

40|$|Abstract—It {{has long}} been {{acknowledged}} that TCP performance suffers in hybrid networks. A Split TCP approach has been proposed to address this problem. In this approach, a proxy is employed at the <b>boundary</b> of <b>wired</b> networks (e. g. the Internet) and wireless networks (e. g. Cellular �etworks, WLan or Mobile Ad Hoc �etworks). This strategy significantly improves TCP performance. However, it does not maintain the end-to-end semantics of TCP.

In this paper, we introduce a novel technique called Semi-Split TCP {{to address the problem}} without sacrificing the benefits of Split TCP.

40|$|As {{the clock}} {{frequencies}} {{used in industry}} increase, the timing requirements on high-speed boards become very tight. Since wire length is directly proportional to wire delay of the buses that connect each chip on high-speed boards, each wire in the bus has to be tightly bounded by the maximum and minimum lengths during routing. These rigid requirements cause challenges for automatic routing. Therefore, more aggressive routing algorithms are required for current industrial circuits. This thesis intends to improve Ozdal and Wong's previous work, which is an algorithmic study of single-layer bus routing on high-speed boards. Their routing algorithm assumes {{that there are no}} boundaries in the grid during routing, and the maximum-length bound for each net is always met. This thesis modifies their code so that it does not make those assumptions. As a result, the program can now handle <b>boundaries</b> with <b>wire</b> snaking to meet the minimum-length bound and use diagonal wires if the Manhattan distance between the two terminal pins cannot satisfy the maximum-length bound...|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{systematic}} quantitative {{description of the}} structure of edge states and magnetosubband evolution in hard wall quantum wires in the integer quantum Hall regime. Our calculations are based on the self-consistent Green's function technique where the electron- and spin interactions are included within the density functional theory in the local spin density approximation. We analyze the evolution of the magnetosubband structure as magnetic field varies and show that it exhibits different features as compared to the case of a smooth confinement. In particularly, in the hard-wall wire a deep and narrow triangular potential well (of the width of magnetic length $l_B$) is formed {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>wire</b> <b>boundary.</b> The wave functions are strongly localized in this well which leads to the increase of the electron density near the edges. Because of the presence of this well, the subbands start to depopulate from the central region of the wire and remain pinned in the well region until they are eventually pushed up by increasing magnetic field. We also demonstrate that the spin polarization of electron density as a function of magnetic field shows a pronounced double-loop pattern that can be related to the successive depopulation of the magnetosubbands. In contrast to the case of a smooth confinement, in hard-wall wires the compressible strips do not form in the vicinity of <b>wire</b> <b>boundaries</b> and spatial spin separation between spin-up and spin-down states near edges is absent.

40|$|Development of {{advanced}} models at the grain size scales {{has so far}} been mostly limited to simulated geometry structures such as for example 3 D Voronoi tessellations.
