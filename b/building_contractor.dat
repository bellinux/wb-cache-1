5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, plans {{were made by}} the Office for Monument Protection to restore the church by 1997, the 850th anniversary of Moscow's foundation. This {{proposal}} was not implemented because of the dispute over occupancy. However, in 1995, the city determined that the parish would be responsible for restoration costs. A commission was founded for the planned restoration, chaired by parish priest Josef Sanevski, Russian historian Stanislav Durnin, and Polish <b>building</b> <b>contractor</b> and politician Grzegorz Tuderek.|$|E

He served in the army again during the Second World War, {{although}} his later service was blighted by periods of ill-health. At his final retirement from the military in 1945, O'Leary was an Army major in command of a prisoner of war camp. Between the wars, O'Leary spent many years employed as a police officer in Canada and is sometimes considered to be a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross. Following the Second World War he worked as a <b>building</b> <b>contractor</b> in London, where he died in 1961.|$|E

5|$|Runyon {{was built}} {{immediately}} after the entry of Union forces into Virginia on May 24, 1861, on the land of James Roach, a Washington <b>building</b> <b>contractor.</b> Fort Runyon was the largest fort in the ring of defenses that protected Washington during the Civil War and was named after Brigadier General Theodore Runyon, commander of the Fourth Division of the Army of Northeastern Virginia during the First Battle of Bull Run. Union soldiers garrisoned the fort until its dismantling {{following the end of}} the Civil War in 1865. Today, no trace of the fort remains on the site, which is now exit 9 on Interstate 395, though a historical marker has been constructed by the Arlington Historical Society.|$|E
5|$|The {{land for}} the fort was {{appropriated}} from James Roach, a <b>building</b> <b>contractor</b> in Washington who was the second-largest landowner in the county, behind only the Lee family. Soldiers tore up land, dug trenches, and used gardens for latrines. Roach's mansion on Prospect Hill was vandalized by Union forces during the construction of Fort Runyon, but survived the war and was demolished in 1965. Other land for Fort Runyon and Fort Jackson came from the demolition of Jackson City, a collection of gambling establishments, saloons, and a racetrack that were located {{at the southern end}} of the Long Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Romeo Guest, a <b>building</b> <b>contractor,</b> {{met with}} the North Carolina state treasurer, Brandon Hodges, and the {{president}} of Wachovia, Robert Hanes, to discuss building a research park in North Carolina to attract new industries to the region. They obtained support for the concept of Research Triangle Park from state governor Luther Hodges and the three universities that form the research triangle: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke University and North Carolina State University. The Research Triangle Institute (now RTI International) was formed as the research park's first tenant in 1958 by the park's founders. The following January they announced that $1.425 million had been raised by the Research Triangle Foundation to fund the park and that $500,000 of it had been set aside for RTI.|$|E

5|$|No longer fit {{for full}} active service, O'Leary was {{transferred}} to the Pioneer Corps and took command of a prisoner of war camp in Southern England. In 1945, he was discharged from the military as unfit for duty on medical grounds as a major and found work as a <b>building</b> <b>contractor,</b> in which career he remained until his retirement in 1954. Two of O'Leary's sons had also served in the military during the war, with both receiving Distinguished Flying Crosses for their actions. As a Victoria Cross recipient, O'Leary joined the VE day parade in 1946, but at the 1956 Centenary VC review his place was taken by an imposter travelling in a bath chair. With his health again declining, O'Leary moved to Limesdale Gardens in Edgware shortly before his death in 1961 at the Whittington Hospital in Islington.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{industries}} (small-scale services, for example) tend to {{have more}} VAT avoidance, particularly where cash transactions predominate, and VAT may be criticized for encouraging this. From the perspective of government, however, VAT may be preferable because it captures {{at least some of the}} value added. For example, a <b>building</b> <b>contractor</b> may offer to provide services for cash (i.e. without a receipt, and without VAT) to a homeowner, who usually cannot claim input VAT back. The homeowner will thus bear lower costs and the <b>building</b> <b>contractor</b> may be able to avoid other taxes (profit or payroll taxes).|$|E

25|$|New Mills {{was just}} below Platt Bridge, while Milford Mill was just above Milford Bridge. Adcote Mill was by Adcote Farm, {{and most of}} the {{channels}} can still be seen. There were two mills at Yeaton, the Upper Mill and the Lower Mill, either side of Yeaton Bridge, and the final two were Fitz Mill and Mytton Mill. Fitz Mill was operational between the twelfth century and 1926, and the structure is now used by a haulage company. Mytton Mill was operational until 1966, when production ceased. The building was unused until 1971, when it became offices for a <b>building</b> <b>contractor.</b> A fire caused severe damage in 1982, but the building has since been restored, and now provides workshops for a number of small businesses, including the <b>building</b> <b>contractor.</b>|$|E
