5|$|It soars high while {{searching for}} food, holding its wings {{horizontally}} when gliding. It flaps in short bursts which {{are followed by}} short periods of gliding. Its flight is less efficient than that of other vultures, as the wings are not as long, forming a smaller wing area. In comparison with the turkey vulture, the <b>black</b> <b>vulture</b> flaps its wings more frequently during flight. It is known to regurgitate when approached or disturbed, which assists in predator deterrence and taking flight by decreasing its takeoff weight. Like all New World vultures, the <b>black</b> <b>vulture</b> often defecates on its own legs, using the evaporation {{of the water in}} the feces and/or urine to cool itself, a process known as urohidrosis. It cools the blood vessels in the unfeathered tarsi and feet, and causes white uric acid to streak the legs. Because it lacks a syrinx, the <b>black</b> <b>vulture,</b> like other New World vultures, has very few vocalization capabilities. It is generally silent, but can make hisses and grunts when agitated or while feeding. The <b>black</b> <b>vulture</b> is , and roosts in large groups. In areas where their ranges overlap, the <b>black</b> <b>vulture</b> will roost on the bare branches of dead trees alongside groups of turkey vultures. The <b>black</b> <b>vulture</b> generally forages in groups; a flock of black vultures can easily drive a rival turkey vulture, which is generally solitary while foraging, from a carcass.|$|E
5|$|In natural settings, the <b>black</b> <b>vulture</b> eats mainly carrion. In areas {{populated}} by humans, it may scavenge at garbage dumps, but also takes eggs and decomposing plant material and can kill or injure newborn or incapacitated mammals. Like other vultures, it {{plays an important}} role in the ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease. The <b>black</b> <b>vulture</b> locates food either by sight or by following New World vultures of the genus Cathartes to carcasses. These vultures—the turkey vulture, the lesser yellow-headed vulture, and the greater yellow-headed vulture—forage by detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. Their heightened ability to detect odors allows them to search for carrion below the forest canopy. The <b>black</b> <b>vulture</b> is aggressive when feeding, and may chase the slightly larger turkey vulture from carcasses.|$|E

5|$|Martin Lichtenstein {{described}} C. a. foetens, the Andean <b>black</b> <b>vulture,</b> in 1817, and Charles Lucien Bonaparte described C. a. brasiliensis, from Central and South America, in 1850 on {{the basis}} of smaller size and minor plumage differences.

5|$|Fossil (or subfossil) <b>black</b> <b>vultures</b> cannot {{necessarily}} {{be attributed to}} the Pleistocene or the recent species without further information: the same size variation found in the living bird was also present in its larger prehistoric relative. Thus, in 1968, Hildegarde Howard separated the Mexican birds as Coragyps occidentalis mexicanus as opposed to the birds from locations farther north (such as Rancho La Brea) which constituted the nominate subspecies C. o. occidentalis. The southern birds were of the same size as present-day north <b>black</b> <b>vultures</b> and can only be distinguished by their somewhat stouter tarsometatarsus and the flatter and wider bills, and even then only with any certainty if the location where the fossils were found is known. As the Pleistocene and current <b>black</b> <b>vultures</b> form an evolutionary continuum rather than splitting into two or more lineages, some include the Pleistocene taxa in C. atratus.|$|R

5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>vulture</b> is {{considered}} a threat by cattle ranchers due to its predation on newborn cattle. The droppings produced by black vultures and other vultures can harm or kill trees and other vegetation.

5|$|It {{is a large}} <b>black</b> <b>vulture</b> with a ruff {{of white}} {{feathers}} surrounding {{the base of the}} neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most birds of prey, the male is larger than the female.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>vulture</b> also {{occasionally}} {{feeds on}} livestock or deer. It {{is the only}} species of New World vulture which preys on cattle. It occasionally harasses cows which are giving birth, but primarily preys on newborn calves. In its first few weeks, a calf will allow vultures to approach it. The vultures swarm the calf in a group, then peck at the calf's eyes, or at the nose or the tongue. The calf then goes into shock and is killed by the vultures. Black vultures have sometimes been seen to pick ticks off resting capybaras.|$|E

5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>vulture</b> {{appears in}} a variety of Maya hieroglyphics in Mayan codices. It is {{normally}} connected with either death or as a bird of prey. The vulture's glyph is often shown attacking humans. This species lacks the religious connections that the king vulture has. While some of the glyphs clearly show the black vulture's open nostril and hooked beak, some are assumed to be this species because they are vulture-like but lack the king vulture's knob and are painted black. This vulture has appeared on two stamps: those of Guyana in 1990 and Nicaragua in 1994.|$|E
5|$|New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they locate carcasses. The turkey vulture has a red head. The <b>black</b> <b>vulture</b> has a grey head. Although not a water bird, a flock of black vultures at the Myakka River State Park, southeast of Sarasota, has been seen bathing {{at the edge of the}} lake and then drying out their wings in the same way as cormorants like the Florida anhinga. This habit may help free them of parasites.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>vulture</b> is a {{scavenger}} and {{feeds on}} carrion, {{but will also}} eat eggs or kill newborn animals. In areas populated by humans, it also feeds at garbage dumps. It finds its meals either by using its keen eyesight or by following other (New World) vultures, which possess {{a keen sense of}} smell. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses. It lays its eggs in caves or hollow trees or on the bare ground, and generally raises two chicks each year, which it feeds by regurgitation. In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. This vulture also appeared in Mayan codices.|$|E

5|$|While some of {{the native}} flora and fauna of the Sonoran Desert can be found within Phoenix city limits, most {{are found in the}} suburbs and the undeveloped desert areas {{surrounding}} the city. Native mammal species include coyote, javelina, bobcat, mountain lion, desert cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit, antelope ground squirrel, mule deer, ringtail, coati, and multiple species of bats, such as the Mexican free-tailed bat and western pipistrelle, that roost in and around the city. There are many species of native birds, including Costa's hummingbird, Anna's hummingbird, Gambel's quail, Gila woodpecker, mourning dove, white-winged dove, the roadrunner, the cactus wren, and many species of raptors, including falcons, hawks, owls, vultures (such as the turkey vulture and <b>black</b> <b>vulture),</b> and eagles, including the golden and the bald eagle.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>vulture</b> {{can be held}} in captivity, {{though the}} Migratory Bird Treaty Act only allows this {{in the case of}} animals which are injured or unable to return to the wild. It {{receives}} special legal protections under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in the United States, by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada, and by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds and Game Mammals in Mexico. In the United States it is illegal to take, kill, or possess black vultures and violation of the law is punishable by a fine of up to US$15,000 and imprisonment of up to six months. It is listed as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN Red List. Populations appear to remain stable, and it has not reached the threshold of inclusion as a threatened species, which requires a decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its size}} and gaudy coloration, this vulture is quite {{inconspicuous}} when it is perched in trees. While perched, it holds its head lowered and thrust forward. It is non-migratory and, unlike the turkey, lesser yellow-headed and American <b>black</b> <b>vulture,</b> it generally lives alone or in small family groups. Groups of up to 12 birds have been observed bathing and drinking in a pool above a waterfall in Belize. One or two birds generally descend to feed at a carcass, although occasionally up to ten or so may gather if there is significant amount of food. King vultures have lived up to 30 years in captivity, though their lifespan in the wild is unknown. This vulture uses urohidrosis, defecating on its legs, to lower its body temperature. Despite its bill and large size, it is relatively unaggressive at a kill. The king vulture lacks a voice box, although it can make low croaking noises and wheezing sounds in courtship, and bill-snapping noises when threatened. Its only natural predators are snakes, which will prey upon the vulture's eggs and young, and large cats such as jaguars, which may surprise and kill an adult vulture at a carcass.|$|E

25|$|Golden eagles, being {{habitual}} scavengers at carrion, {{come into}} conflict with scavenging birds as well. They may encounter corvids at carrion sites and the large passerines are often highly cautious, either feeding {{some distance from the}} eagle or waiting until the eagle is done eating, lest they be predaceously grabbed. Occasionally, however, corvids may behave more boldly around golden eagles. In one case, a group of three black-billed magpies were observed to rob a golden eagle of its prey. Golden eagles also usually dominate both New World and Old World vultures. Smaller species like <b>black</b> <b>vulture</b> (Coragyps atratus) in North America and Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) in Eurasia are known to be occasionally hunted by golden eagles. Besides the Steller's sea eagle, the larger species of Old World vulture and the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) are the only noticeably larger raptorial birds that a golden eagle may encounter. The relationship between these large vultures and golden eagles can be highly contentious, with most sources favoring victory for the eagle due to its more aggressive disposition, much stronger feet and sharp talons. In one case, a colony of griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) was exceptionally able to displace a pair golden eagles from a cliff where they were trying nest so they could nest there themselves. On the other hand, a 5-year-old griffon vulture reintroduced into the wild in Bulgaria was thought to have been killed by a golden eagle. The golden eagle is a potential predator of the lammergeier which is often attracted to much the same habitat and prey as the eagle but often feeds largely on bone marrow from carcasses. It has been observed that both golden eagles and lammergeiers will readily pirate food away from each other. In the Southwestern United States, several conflicts between huge California condors and golden eagles have been observed. At carrion, victory during conflicts can go either way apparently. Recent observation have suggested that the critically endangered condors do not seem to actively defend their nesting territories from golden eagles but have been recorded gaining incidental protection from prairie falcons and common ravens, which both aggressively displaced the eagles from their own adjacent territories. The golden eagle is considered an occasional predator of California condors (especially fledglings) but there seems to be {{little in the way of}} eyewitness accounts to confirm this. It is possible that (as in the Bulgarian griffon vultures) the California condors have lost their natural cautiousness around eagles due to having been reintroduced from captivity.|$|E
500|$|The <b>black</b> <b>vulture</b> (Coragyps atratus), {{also known}} as the American <b>black</b> <b>vulture,</b> is a bird in the New World vulture family whose range extends from the southeastern United States to Central Chile and Uruguay in South America.

[...] It is the only extant member of the genus Coragyps, which is in the family Cathartidae. Despite the similar name and appearance, this species is unrelated to the Eurasian <b>black</b> <b>vulture,</b> an Old World vulture in the family Accipitridae (which includes eagles, hawks, kites and harriers).

40|$|Understanding {{the factors}} {{underlying}} species coexistence {{is a major}} focus in community ecology. When dealing with competition between native and exotic species, the competitive exclusion of the ‘weaker’ species can have consequences for biodiversity conservation. We examined interspeciﬁc interactions during foraging between <b>black</b> <b>vultures</b> Coragyps atratus and Andean condors Vultur gryphus in Southern Argentina. Previous studies suggest facilitatory interactions between them. However, {{in most parts of}} their distribution ranges, these species did not coexist until recently, when <b>black</b> <b>vultures</b> expanded their geographic range following human development. Thus, facilitatory processes or segregation patterns could not be ﬁne-tuned enough to allow their coexistence. Our hypothesis is that <b>black</b> <b>vultures</b> and Andean condors compete for food resources, and that this competitive scenario can change depending on local species abundances and habitat humanization. We experimentally placed sheep carcasses in two habitats differing in degrees of humanization to study the foraging patterns in these species. Both species exploited carcasses with similar temporal patterns. However, the ﬁrst to arrive and the dominant species were different in both habitats, according to their abundances. Although <b>black</b> <b>vultures</b> do not completely prevent the arrival of Andean condors to carcasses, they represent serious obstacles for feeding. Thus, while dominance hierarchy at carcasses could be related to body size, carcass consumption was determined by species abundance. Our results support the hypothesis that the expansion of a ‘winning’ species may trigger interspeciﬁc competition with other ‘loser’ species, with negative responses towards human activities when they became abundant. Although the results are not conclusive, invasion and extinction processes could be occurring and they can have serious consequences for the diversity (i. e. richness and evenness) of the New World scavenger guilds.
