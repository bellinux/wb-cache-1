The slaughter of the unfortunate Allan <b>Breack</b> had given a different colour to Hamish's offence; for the deceased was much beloved, and besides belonged to a numerous and powerful clan, of whom there were many in the ranks. The unfortunate criminal, on the contrary, was little known to, and scarcely connected with, any of his regimental companions. His father had been, indeed, distinguished for his strength and manhood; but he was of a broken clan, as those names were called who had no chief to lead them to battle.|$|E

40|$|Destructive {{testing of}} {{materials}} for determination of mechanical properties and later also non-destructive testing (NDT), historically speaking, have their roots in the safety technology beginning {{in the last century}} when steam engines were developed asking for pressurised components. The foundation of the union of steam vessel users was the beginning of these activities in Germany. Whereas at this time material properties only were destructively assessed under loads NDT was visual inspection and the objectives for the tests were detection of irregularities and nonconformities in the joints of the components, which - at that in pressurised components started to become a regular procedure after the 1 st world war when techniques like magnetic particle inspection for surface <b>breacking</b> cracks in 1917 by Hoke in US [1] and later X-ray radiography by Lester in 1922 [2] for bulk volume inspection were aviable.

[...] "Give me to eat," [...] she said. [...] "I am the widow of MacTavish Mhor--I am the mother of Hamish MacTavish Bean,--give me to eat, that I may once more see my fair-haired son." [...] Her demand was never refused, though granted in many cases {{with a kind of}} struggle between compassion and aversion in some of those to whom she applied, which was in others qualified by fear. The share she had had in occasioning the death of Allan <b>Breack</b> Cameron, which must probably involve that of her own son, was not accurately known; but, from a knowledge of her violent passions and former habits of life, no one doubted that in one way or other she had been the cause of the catastrophe, and Hamish Bean was considered, in the slaughter which he had committed, rather as the instrument than as the accomplice of his mother.|$|E
60|$|Whilst {{the women}} thus discoursed together, {{as they watched}} the corpse of Allan <b>Breack</b> Cameron, the unhappy cause of his death pursued her lonely way across the mountain. While she {{remained}} {{within sight of the}} bothy, she put a strong constraint on herself, that by no alteration of pace or gesture she might afford to her enemies the triumph of calculating the excess of her mental agitation, nay, despair. She stalked, therefore, with a slow rather than a swift step, and, holding herself upright, seemed at once to endure with firmness that woe which was passed, and bid defiance to that which was about to come. But when she was beyond the sight of those who remained in the hut, she could no longer suppress the extremity of her agitation. Drawing her mantle wildly round her, she stopped at the first knoll, and climbing to its summit, extended her arms up to the bright moon, as if accusing heaven and earth for her misfortunes, and uttered scream on scream, like those of an eagle whose nest has been plundered of her brood. Awhile she vented her grief in these inarticulate cries, then rushed on her way with a hasty and unequal step, in the vain hope of overtaking the party which was conveying her son a prisoner to Dunbarton. But her strength, superhuman as it seemed, failed her in the trial; nor was it possible for her, with her utmost efforts, to accomplish her purpose.|$|E
40|$|A fast mode collisionless {{bow shock}} is a {{permanent}} feature of the solar wind interaction with the earth. The shock is approximately stationary in earth coordinates, its structure, however, changes in space due to different [MATH] values, and in time, due to different solar wind conditions (Mach number M and β, Te/T 1 [...] .). The earth's bow shock has revealed itself as an impressive tool for studying collisionless shock waves. After the large theoretical efforts in studying collisionless shock waves, in the past, it is possible, today, to verify experimentally that different dissipation mechanisms are at work in different plasma regimes. The extensive examination of bow shock morphology allow us, today, to correlate distinctions in bow shock structure, revealed {{by a variety of}} diagnostics, with M, β and Bn in the solar wind. For quasi parallel geometries and apparently for any M and β, the shock layer broadens and <b>breacks</b> up, showing limited level of plasma wave noise and marked precursor effects. For quasi perpendicular shock waves, on the contrary, electromagnetic turbulence increases with β, almost independent of M; while electrostatic noise level increase with M, almost independent of β. Comparison with the different theories valid in the different plasma regimes is the present task...|$|R

The experimental investigations revealed {{that the number of}} cycles required to <b>breack</b> the samples increased with frequency. In contrast, the corresponding time-to-failure values did not depend on frequency. Both the qualitative behavior and the quantitative life-time results agreed very well with a prediction based on a fracture mechanical model. Therefore, it could be concluded that fatigue behavior in the considered frequency range ist solely controlled by stress corrosion in the bonded interface. Furthermore, the results demonstrate an available approach for life-time prediction of wafer-bonded micro-electro-mechanical systems components stressed by cycling loading...|$|E

The sizes of contact spot and and indention of spherical body where defined by iterations repeating the procedure of finite element analysis. Zero-contact-stress condition on the contact spot contour allows to obtain the solution of contact problem. Conclusions of numerical analysis of the elastic stress state of composite at low-speed impact are compared with results of microscopic investigation. The use of the general criteria of destruction can give the sufficient information for the approximate prediction of kind of partial destructions in a material and the sizes of a zone of damage. Conclusion on effect of stresses localness has been confirmed.

40|$|At Somplago near Tolmezzo, two {{horizontal}} pendulums,reaching periods up to 20 minutes, are operanting (experimentally) in a 130 m high, excavated mountain pit; the pit {{is connected}} with the subterraneanpower plant house where, in a room, is installed an electromagneticseismic station. The sensibility of the pendulums to the variations of theapparent vertical is extreme. At present, their period is {{on the order of}} 5 minutes. In the first half of January 1969, in the region of the Ambiesta (aright-side confluent of the Tagliamento river, with which it unites nearTolmezzo) there occurred a small seismic period, characterized by two smallshocks, almost unnoticed by the local population; the first on the 7 th andthe second, stronger one, on the 14 th of January. After about 10 yearsof near immobility, at the end of November and along all of December,the clinographs functioning in the rocks, on the right of the Ambiesta atthe level of the dam barring te river, showed a perceptible, slow ondulationof the ground. This variation of the vertical can be put in relation withthe minor shock of January 7 th 1969, that was perceived by the personnel of the Ambiesta-dam and recorded by the local seismic station as well asby the seismic stations of Tolmezzo and of Somplago. This first shock isto be considered definitely superficial. The second shock occurred on January 14 th, in the region betweenthe Ambiesta-river and Somplago. Its depth has been estimated 011 theorder of 13 km. This shock was preceded by a very small displacementof pendulum " A " at Somplago on January 12 th, and then followed &mdash;several hours after the earthquake &mdash; by a perceivable deviation of thevertical, recorded by both pendulums " A " and " B ". The displacement(slightly above one second of arc) occurred more or less in direction ofthe source of the earthquake, with trend S 46 &deg; from Somplago. This isin accordance {{with the fact that the}} Somplago seisndc station recorded theearthquake as starting in the form of a compression (upward thrust). Themaximum displacement was reached in only a few hours, while it took about 20 days to bring the pendulums back to their primitive position. If &mdash;as everything seems to indicate &mdash; the displacement showed by the longperiodpendulums is to be related to the consequences provoked by the shockin his ipocentral location, it can be deduced that the propagation in directionSomplago of the recorded ondulating movement has been very slow (witha velocity inferior to 1 km/h). In other words, the displacement of mattersubsequent to the <b>breack</b> in the elastic field occurred in the liypocenter,lias taken on the form of an extremely slow ondulation, evidently associatedwith the gradual proceeding of the deformed stratification to a new systemof equilibrium. There have been other occasions, in the Tolmezzo area,permitting to detect a clear relation between slow variations of the verticaland local earthquakes. In the contemplated case at Somplago, the ondulationsfollowing the earthquake of 14. January have been definitely greaterthan the ones preceding the quake. In my opinion, it is with this course of action &mdash; geodynamic, geodetic,geomagnetic and geoelectric observations &mdash; that one can hope to gatherthe information apt to confer a more realistic character to the forecastingof seismic phenomena. To insist &mdash; as it is yet done in Italy &mdash; with thestatistical methods, is plainly illusory work. Max Planck spoke ironicallyof the pretense of some of his colleagues to resolve fundamental problemsof physics basing on the probability table. " Only the strictly dynamiclaws &mdash; the famous physicist pointed out &mdash; satisfy wholly our need ofknowledge, while no statistical law can actually satisfy, because it has noabsolute value but admits of exceptions in the single cases and thus leavesus confronting the problem to know which are the cases where such exceptionsmay occur ". " Therefore it appears convenient &mdash; it is still Planckspeaking &mdash; to claim among the postulates of physics not only the existenceof laws, but also their strictly causal character and to never consider closedthe investigation, until each and every statistic law is resolved into oneor more dynamic laws "...|$|E
