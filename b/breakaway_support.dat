5000|$|In 1857, Clark {{was elected}} to the Iowa House of Representatives, and played an {{important}} role in adapting the laws to the new Iowa Constitution. In the 1860 presidential election, he participated in the Iowa state Democratic convention (declining to follow the <b>breakaway</b> faction <b>supporting</b> the John C. Breckinridge candidacy), where he was elected as a potential presidential elector for U.S. Senator Stephen A. Douglas.

In 1983 the SLSSP dissolved itself and he joined the SLFP and contested the Matugama seat at a by-election and won. He represented Matugama until 1989 and then {{was one of the}} MPs – under proportional representation – for the Kalutara District until 2000. During the 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom, he intervened to save several people from death. During the 'White Terror' of 1988–90, he was active in saving hundreds of suspects from summary execution – at one point having to threaten an Army commandant with attack.|$|R
25|$|Breakaway was {{released}} on November 30, 2004, and became Clarkson's most commercially successful album. After debuting at number three on the Billboard 200, its longevity allowed it to become the third-best-selling album of 2005 in the US and was certified sextuple platinum by the RIAA. The album also enjoyed success throughout the world; it topped the charts in the Netherlands and Ireland and became the world's seventh-best-selling album of 2005 {{and went on to}} sell over 12 million copies worldwide.

And Russia has sought to exploit the gaps that have emerged as a result." [...] They went on to say [...] "Russia ... tacitly <b>supported</b> <b>breakaway</b> provinces ... Moscow has also granted Russian citizenship to some 90% of the Abkhazian and South Ossetian populations, giving it grounds to intervene whenever Russia deems it expedient, on the basis of ensuring the security of its citizens." ...|$|R
5000|$|By far {{the most}} {{important}} aspect of highway transportation research between 1962 and 1976 was the recognition of the importance of highway safety issues to the traveling public, the government, and the transportation community. Charles J. [...] "Jack" [...] Keese, an A&M civil engineering professor and TTI researcher since 1955, led TTI through this period. Under Keese, who had also worked as a traffic engineer for the city of Midland, Texas, TTI began assisting highway planners and engineers with a focused effort to improve safety for motorists, creating the concept of the [...] "forgiving" [...] roadside. In addition to milestone safety innovations and improvements, the Keese years marked a great expansion in the scope of TTI’s work. Researchers began analyzing and addressing more urban transportation problems, such as freeway design and operations, traffic congestion, and efficiency of emergency services. While the Institute continued to improve highway construction and maintenance methodologies, it also allocated more time and resources to studying the social, economic and environmental implications of all transportation modes. As highway construction and usage continued to increase through the 1960s, so did injury and death rates per vehicle mile, rising every year except in 1966. Some of the innovations developed at TTI in this period were <b>breakaway</b> sign <b>supports,</b> the [...] "Texas Crash Cushion", guardrail and end treatments, railroad grade-crossing inventories, median barriers and culvert grates--all becoming a more integral part of the highway landscape moving into the 1970s.|$|R
500|$|Breakaways singles [...] "Since U Been Gone", [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes", [...] "Because of You", [...] "Walk Away", and [...] "Breakaway" [...] became {{worldwide}} {{hits and}} have become some of Clarkson's signature songs. Their successes prompted Billboard to credit her for landscaping the core sound of mainstream pop music as an uptempo dance-oriented sound in the 2000s. Furthermore, Breakaway established Clarkson {{as one of the}} four highest-selling acts of Sony BMG in the 2000s, and made Davis, Dr. Luke, and Martin into prominent pop producers today. Internationally, the album topped the music charts of Ireland and the Netherlands and became the world's 7th biggest-selling release of 2005, eventually being certified platinum in over 17 countries. To <b>support</b> <b>Breakaway,</b> Clarkson embarked on three international concert tours from 2005 to 2006: the Breakaway World Tour, Hazel Eyes Tour, and the Addicted Tour. Billboard placed the album 77th in [...] the Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums.|$|R
500|$|The team {{set about}} taking time {{back in the}} high {{mountain}} stage 18, ending with an hors catégorie arrival at the Col du Galibier. Monfort and Posthuma both made the morning <b>breakaway,</b> providing <b>support</b> for Andy Schleck after he attacked out {{of the group of}} overall favorites on the ascent of the Col d'Izoard. Schleck bridged first to Posthuma and then to Monfort, the latter guiding him down the [...] long descent of the Izoard, as Schleck is a superlative climber but a poor descender. After catching and surpassing all other remaining members from the morning breakaway, Monfort then rode an extremely lengthy and strenuous pull ahead of Schleck until [...] remained in the stage, when he finally bonked and dropped back. This left Andy free to climb the Galibier solo, taking the stage win alone two minutes ahead of the next rider, which happened to be brother Fränk. He rode clear of the group of the race's top riders in the final kilometer, gaining eight seconds against Evans. While the team's tactics on the day appeared to cinch the yellow jersey for Andy, prior race leader Voeckler retained the yellow jersey by a margin of 15 seconds. The status quo among the Schlecks and Evans held on stage 19, though with Voeckler finally falling {{from the top of the}} overall classification that gave Andy Schleck the yellow jersey ahead of the stage 20 individual time trial. Stage 19, ending at Alpe d'Huez, had favored Schleck ahead of Evans, and he was characterized as missing an important opportunity to pad his lead ahead of the time trial, where Evans' skills are superior.|$|R
