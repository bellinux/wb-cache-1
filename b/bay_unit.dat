40|$|Many {{hospitals}} are expanding or adding neonatal services, resulting in new construction and experimentation with innovative facility design. One {{of the most}} significant innovations has been to provide private single family rooms (SFRs) rather than multi-bed bays. This study examined the interactions between families and staff, families and other families, and families and infants in these two settings. Two Midwestern, Level III neonatal intensive care units were studied in this project. Forty hours of behavioral observation were gathered using pocket PCs preprogrammed with observational software which allowed the observers to record verbal, visual and body behaviors. The primary hypotheses of this study were that: 1) interactions between families in single-family rooms would decrease in the single family room setting relative to the Open Bay setting; 2) interactions between families and staff would decrease in the single-family room settings relative to the Open Bay Setting; and 3) interactions between families and infants would increase in the single family room settings relative to the Open Bay setting. Overall, the data suggested the occurrence of more frequent interactions in Open <b>Bay</b> <b>units,</b> but longer interactions in SFRs. From a design perspective it might be recommended that Open <b>Bay</b> <b>units</b> provide spaces which permit longer encounters between families and other families and staff, and that SFRs provide more spaces that allow for spontaneous encounters with other families and staff, while taking into consideration unnecessarily large distances between rooms...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{reliability}} evaluation of substation automation systems {{has received a}} significant attention from the research community. With {{the advent of the}} concept of smart grid, there is a growing trend to integrate more computation and communication technology into power systems. This thesis focuses on the {{reliability evaluation}} of modern substation automation systems. Such systems include both physical devices (current carrying) such as lines, circuit breakers, and transformers, as well as cyber devices (Ethernet switches, intelligent electronic devices, and cables) and belong to a broader class of cyber-physical systems. We assume that the substation utilizes IEC 61850 standard, which is a dominant standard for substation automation. Focusing on IEC 61850 standard, we discuss the failure modes and analyze their effects on the system. We utilize reliability block diagrams for analyzing the reliability of substation components (<b>bay</b> <b>units)</b> and then use the state space approach to study the effects at the substation level. Case study is based on an actual IEC 61850 substation automation system, with different network topologies consideration concluded. Our analysis provides a starting point for evaluating the reliability of the substation and the effects of substation failures {{to the rest of the}} power system. By using the state space methods, the steady state probability of each failure effects were calculated in different <b>bay</b> <b>units.</b> These probabilities can be further used in the modeling of the composite power system to analyze the loss of load probabilities...|$|R

50|$|The Russian Viceroy and his {{military}} advisers had grasped the situation. The Stange Bay made that Russians informed very dearly for every foot of their advance. The Russian diversion to Stange <b>Bay</b> <b>unit</b> {{meant to be}} a support element to operations to capture Sarikamish and Kars. Russians needed to be strongly reinforced. At this moment, In December 1914, General Myshlaevsky ordered withdrawal from major Russian units at the Persian Campaign {{at the height of the}} Battle of Sarikamish. Persia was denuded of Russian soldiers, and large bodies of troops were hurried forward to the front by rail from Kars, Erivan, and Julfa—almost, but not quite, too late. They would have been altogether too late if the 1st Army Corps had been able to make its contemplated descent on Kars, and the first concern of the Viceroy had been to send supports to the gallant regiment which alone had so long withstood the attack of the two divisions of this Corps before and at Ardahan.|$|E
50|$|From {{the nineteenth}} century to the twentieth century the area {{has been used in}} a variety of ways, {{including}} manufacturing fertilizer from the remains of dead animals, producing fish oil from the menhaden caught in the bay, and more recently a landfill for the disposal of New York City’s garbage. Periodic clogging by carcasses from the adjacent glue factory with 200 foot chimney gave the bay its name. A millstone used to grind horse bones can still be found along the Millstone trail. In 1926, much of the salt marsh surrounding Dead Horse Bay and the rest of Barren Island were pumped with sand from Jamaica Bay. This raised the land to 16 feet above the high tide mark and connected the islands to each other, and the mainland of Brooklyn, in order to create Floyd Bennett Field as New York City's first municipal airport. The entire area, including the historic airfield, is now managed by the National Park Service as part of the Jamaica <b>Bay</b> <b>Unit</b> of the Gateway National Recreation Area.|$|E
