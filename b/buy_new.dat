5|$|Seetharamudu was a {{barrister}} {{who returned}} from London upon his father's death to manage his family businesses. He was a zamindar and {{was fond of}} cars. In one such instance, he sees a poor farmer called Ramalakshmi and decides to marry her. Asked by a mediator, she accepts the proposal, without meeting Seetharamudu, but asks him for six months' delay as she has to <b>buy</b> <b>new</b> clothes for the bridegroom, following the village's tradition. Seetharamudu learns about this and meets her as a reformed thief. With his help, Ramalakshmi could cultivate enough grain in three months and <b>buy</b> <b>new</b> clothes with that money. On the day of marriage, she is surprised to know that Seetharamudu is her chosen groom and they marry. On 14 February 1924 the couple goes out, but Chaitanya, suffering from fever then, fakes a stomach ache so that his parents return. The plan works and the couple rush home at high speed but die in an accident at 10:20 AM near the same clock tower where Radha Mohan and Krishna Veni would die. Now he aims to reunite them without letting them recollect their past as they cannot bear the pain of losing him.|$|E
5|$|The {{changes were}} met with {{critical}} reception in the province. Many students are now required to pay higher sports fees to cover higher transportation costs. Some schools {{do not have access}} to approved vehicles because the Education Act prohibits schools and school districts from owning vehicles. To get around this they use corporate entities to operate vehicles for extracurricular activities. These require money to <b>buy</b> <b>new</b> vehicles and the required insurance, which often requires schools to conduct extra fundraising.|$|E
5|$|Combat is {{staged in}} a ghostly virtual arena, and Amaterasu can fight enemies using a {{combination}} of weapons, fighting techniques and Brush methods to dispatch the foes. At the end of combat, money (as yen) is rewarded to Amaterasu, with bonuses for completing a battle quickly and without taking damage. The money can be spent on numerous items from merchants across the land, including healing goods, better weapons, tools and key items for completing quests. The money {{can also be used to}} <b>buy</b> <b>new</b> combat techniques at dojos throughout the land.|$|E

5|$|Dobroselova {{considers}} {{moving to}} another part of the city where she can work as a governess. Just as he is out of money and risks being evicted, Devushkin has a stroke of luck: his boss takes pity on him and gives him 100 rubles to <b>buy</b> <b>new</b> clothes. Devushkin pays off his debts and sends some to Dobroselova. She sends him 25 rubles back because she does not need it. The future looks bright for both of them because he can now start to save money and it may be possible for them to move in together.|$|E
5|$|Each {{district}} has fashion trends that affect gameplay. By wearing pins or clothing {{from the more}} popular brands in that district, items' effects will be improved; wearing the least fashionable items will do the opposite, and items from brands in between are not affected. However, the player can increase a brand's popularity in one district by repeatedly fighting battles in that district while wearing items of that brand. The player can enter shops to <b>buy</b> <b>new</b> pins, clothes, and food items that are gradually consumed during battles to improve the characters' basic attributes.|$|E
5|$|Each level {{contains}} items {{the player}} can collect, such as coins, {{which can be}} gathered by either smashing Buzz Cola vending machines, Buzz Cola boxes or wasp cameras, the latter of which become more elusive as the game progresses. The coins {{can be used to}} <b>buy</b> <b>new</b> cars and player outfits, some of which are required to progress through the game. The player can also collect Itchy and Scratchy cards. By collecting all 49 of them, seven in each level, the player unlocks a special The Itchy & Scratchy Show video. Several events cause the player to lose coins; because the character cannot die, injuries cause the player to lose coins. If the player is apprehended during a hit and run, they will be fined 50 coins.|$|E

5|$|Grimsby's ageing {{team made}} a bright start in 1952–53 with five {{straight}} wins but eventually slipped and finished in fifth place. In 1953–54, Shankly became disillusioned when the board {{could not give}} him money to <b>buy</b> <b>new</b> players. He was reluctant to promote some promising reserves because of loyalty to the older players (a fault that was to resurface at Liverpool years later) and he finally resigned in January 1954, citing the board's lack of ambition as his main reason. In his autobiography, {{he said that he}} and his wife were feeling homesick in Grimsby and, when an opportunity came to manage Workington, he was attracted to the challenge partly because they would be closer to Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Nine is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} primarily {{set in a}} cyberspace version of 1990s Tokyo, with players {{taking control of the}} silent main protagonist to explore various environments within Tokyo's districts, along with switching between different districts with a dedicated fast-travel menu. The player can adjust the protagonist's name, gender, hair and skin color. Navigation through environments is presented through a third-person perspective, with the player character being followed by one assigned demon. While navigating safe areas, players can enter shops to <b>buy</b> <b>new</b> equipment and items such as healing potions, and change their character's clothing and hairstyle.|$|E
5|$|Some changes {{introduced}} into Devil May Cry 4 are {{the presence of}} two playable characters, Dante and Nero, and a slight modification to the shop system. A new currency, Proud Souls, is used to <b>buy</b> <b>new</b> abilities while Red Orbs are used to buy items. Proud Souls are rewarded {{at the end of}} missions and the amount varies depending on how well the player performed. Cost of abilities also increase with the purchase of other abilities, though all abilities can be sold back for the original price.|$|E

5|$|As {{the players}} empire expands, agents and {{supervisors}} will make themselves available for employment. Agents {{are used for}} gathering intelligence on alien asteroids and can also be deployed on the players own asteroids for counter-intelligence. Other uses for agents include deploying APV's and destroying various buildings such as defense installations, life support, production, and other various installations. The chances of an agent successfully completing their mission and escaping detection are increased {{if there is a}} spy satellite orbiting the asteroid they are assigned to. Colony Supervisors are able to be employed to help manage the building and maintenance of asteroid colonies. There is no research in the game, as this popular mechanic is replaced with the Sci-Tek blueprint system which allows players to <b>buy</b> <b>new</b> technologies as needed. Multiplayer is available over an IPX network with TetraCorp being the only playable race.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} large debts, which {{at one point}} {{amounted}} to 4million euros, the club {{could not afford to}} <b>buy</b> <b>new</b> players. As a consequence, the first team at the time consisted mostly of youth players mixed with a couple of foreign players brought to the club on free transfers. In the autumn of 2006, the leadership of the club changed, with the debt still amounting to over 3million euros, and it was not until January 2011 that the club announced that the debt had been paid in full. During this period, Maribor never finished above third place in the Slovenian league, and were runners-up in the Slovenian Cup twice. They were, however, one of the 11 winners of the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup, in which they defeated Spanish side Villarreal in the final round, only a couple of months after Villareal had played in the semi-final of the UEFA Champions League.|$|E
5|$|Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade is a {{tactical}} role-playing game where players take {{the role of}} story protagonists Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector as they navigate story-driven missions across the fictional continent of Elibe. The player takes {{the role of an}} unseen tactician directing the player army. The single-player campaign is divided into chapters which generally begin with story elements presented through the use of scenes animated with still images of the main characters, then followed by a battle with an enemy; after each battle, the player is given the opportunity to save their progress. In-game currency is gained either through battles in the game's Link Arena or through other means, rather than from defeating units. Currency can be used to <b>buy</b> <b>new</b> items and weapons at merchants in between battles and at specific locations within maps. Items can also be exchanged between units during battles.|$|E

5|$|Newman {{needed to}} find {{financial}} backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from {{his experience as a}} singing teacher, agreed. As members of Wood's brass and woodwind sections were unwilling to <b>buy</b> <b>new</b> low-pitched instruments, Cathcart imported a set from Belgium and lent them to the players. After a season, the players recognised that the low pitch would be permanently adopted, and they bought the instruments from him.|$|E

5|$|The player's primary mode of {{transportation}} is a starship which serves as Shepard's base of operations. Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, <b>buy</b> <b>new</b> equipment, and travel to numerous planetary systems. Although the game features {{a large number of}} planets for the player to examine, only a few of them can actually be landed on and explored. Some of them can also be surveyed to search for valuable resources and quest-relevant items. Upon landing on a planet, the player can traverse on-foot or by using an all-terrain infantry fighting vehicle called the M35 Mako. Most of the game's main quests are geared toward on-foot combat, but some segments may feature combat requiring the use of the M35 Mako. In contrast, secondary quests usually require the player to explore free-roam uncharted worlds with the vehicle. Equipment items, which include armor, weapon, and ammunition upgrades, can be found around the environment or purchased from merchants in settlements.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the end of}} {{restriction}} of <b>buying</b> <b>new</b> buses from countries of Commonwealth of Nations, KMB introduced one German-built Mercedes-Benz O305 double-decker in 1983. It was followed by another 40 in 1985.|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm, the Philippine Air Force were mobilized to help deliver {{supplies}} and aid in {{search and rescue}} missions. On July24, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared that the National Disaster Coordinating Council would provide assistance to citizens affected by the typhoon. The president requested P134million (PHP, $2.5million USD) for farmers to <b>buy</b> <b>new</b> seeds, and P35million (PHP, $650,000 USD) to rebuild the hard-hit Cagayan Valley, where Arroyo visited days after the storm struck. The government ultimately spent about P24million (PHP, $435,000 USD) in emergency aid for relocating storm victims, search and rescue operations, and assistance. In Mindanao, officials prepared 800bags of rice and various other food supplies due to the storm. Power and water outages persisted across Luzon {{for up to three}} weeks, causing many factories otherwise undamaged to close. In Isabela province, 25Tzu Chi volunteers provided supplies to 2,873houses. The Philippine government provided rice, sardines, and coffee to many affected houses. Damaged houses were supposed to receive 1,000pesos, although few received the monetary aid. In the town of San Mariano in Isabela province, most farmers incurred more debt and continued their same general farming practice, despite sustaining heavy losses from the storm.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} mobilization, the Life Guards arrived at their {{assigned}} position near the Belgian border. Strachwitz and his platoon volunteered for a mounted, long-distance reconnaissance patrol, which would penetrate far behind Belgian lines. His orders were to gather intelligence on rail and communications connections and potentially disturb them, {{as well as}} report on the war preparations being made by their opponents. If the situation allowed, he was to destroy railway and telephone connections and to derail trains, causing as much havoc as possible. His patrol ran into many obstacles and they were constantly {{on the verge of}} being detected by either British or French forces. Their objective was the Paris–Limoges–Bordeaux train track. Strachwitz dispatched a messenger, who broke through to the German lines and delivered the intelligence they had gathered. The patrol blew up the signal box at the Fontainebleau railway station, and tried to force their way through to presumed German troops at the Marne near Châlons. However, the French forces were too strong and they were unable to get through. After six weeks behind the lines their rations were depleted and they had to resort to stealing or begging. Strachwitz then decided to head for Switzerland, hoping that the French–Swiss border was not as heavily protected. After a brief skirmish with French forces, one of Strachwitz's men was seriously wounded, which forced them to seek medical attention. During many weeks of outdoor living their uniforms had deteriorated, so Strachwitz took that opportunity to <b>buy</b> <b>new</b> clothes for his men. Their progress was slowed by the wounded man, and the group was caught in civilian clothes by French forces.|$|E
5|$|The Earp party rode {{north to}} the Percy Ranch, but were not welcomed by Hugh and Jim Percy, who feared the Cowboys; after a meal and some rest, they left around 3:00 {{in the morning of}} March 27. The Earp party slipped into the area near Tombstone and met with supporters, {{including}} Hairlip Charlie Smith and Warren Earp. On March 27, the posse arrived at the Sierra Bonita Ranch owned by Henry Hooker, a wealthy and prominent rancher. That night, Dan Tipton caught the first stage out of Tombstone and headed for Benson, carrying $1,000 from mining owner and Earp supporter E. B. Gage for the posse. Hooker congratulated Earp on the killing of Curly Bill. Hooker fed them and Wyatt told him he wanted to <b>buy</b> <b>new</b> mounts. Hooker was known for his purebred stallions and ran over 500 brood mares that produced horses that became known for their speed, beauty, and temperament. He provided Wyatt and his posse with new mounts, but refused to take Wyatt's money. When Behan's posse was observed in the distance, Hooker suggested Wyatt make his stand there, but Wyatt moved into the hills about three miles (5km) distant near Reilly Hill.|$|E
