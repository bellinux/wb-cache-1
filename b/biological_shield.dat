40|$|Life {{extensions}} {{of nuclear power}} plants (NPPs) to 60 years of operation {{and the possibility of}} subsequent license renewal to 80 years have renewed interest in long-term material degradation in NPPs. Large irreplaceable sections of most nuclear generating stations are constructed from concrete, including safety-related structures such as <b>biological</b> <b>shields</b> and containment buildings; therefore, concrete degradation is being considered with particular focus on radiation-induced effects. Based on the projected neutron fluence values (E > 0. 1 MeV) in the concrete <b>biological</b> <b>shields</b> of the US pressurized water reactor fleet and the currently available data on radiation effects on concrete, some decrease in mechanical properties of concrete cannot be ruled out during extended operation beyond 60 years.

2500|$|Below {{the bottom}} of the reactor core there is the lower <b>biological</b> <b>shield</b> (LBS), similar to the UBS, but only [...] in size. It is {{penetrated}} by the tubes for the lower ends of the pressure channels and carries the weight of the graphite stack and the coolant inlet piping. A steel structure, two heavy plates intersecting in right angle under the center of the LBS and welded to the LBS, supports the LBS and transfers the mechanical load to the building.|$|E
2500|$|The top of {{the reactor}} is covered by the upper <b>biological</b> <b>shield</b> (UBS), also called [...] "Schema E", Pyatachok, or, after the {{explosion}} (of Chernobyl Reactor 4), Elena.

The top and bottom are covered with [...] thick steel plates, welded to be helium-tight, and additionally joined by structural supports. The space between the plates and pipes is filled with serpentinite, a rock containing significant amounts of bound water.

The structure of the UBS supports the fuel and control channels, the floor above the reactor in the central hall, and the steam-water pipes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distribution}} of power density in the reactor is measured by ionization chambers located {{inside and outside the}} core. The physical power density distribution control system (PPDDCS) has sensors inside the core; the reactor control and protection system (RCPS) uses sensors in the core and in the lateral <b>biological</b> <b>shield</b> tank. The external sensors in the tank are located around the reactor middle plane, therefore do not indicate axial power distribution nor information about the power in {{the central part of the}} core. [...] There are over 100 radial and 12 axial power distribution monitors, employing self-powered detectors. Reactivity meters and removable startup chambers are used for monitoring of reactor startup. Total reactor power is recorded as the sum of the currents of the lateral ionization chambers. The moisture and temperature of the gas circulating in the channels is monitored by the pressure tube integrity monitoring system.|$|E
50|$|This {{activation}} of the coolant water requires extra <b>biological</b> <b>shielding</b> around the nuclear reactor plant. It is the high energy gamma ray in the second reaction that causes the major concern. This is why water that has recently been inside a nuclear reactor must be shielded until this radiation subsides. One to two minutes is generally sufficient.|$|R
