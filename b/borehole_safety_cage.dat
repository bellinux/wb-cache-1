50|$|Volvo's {{first modern}} convertible, the C70 was {{manufactured}} in Uddevalla, Sweden {{on a separate}} assembly line from the 70-series sedan and station wagon. The four-seater convertible featured an electrically heated glass rear window, automatic (pop-up) rollover hoops system ROPS, seat belt pre-tensioners, boron steel reinforced A-pillars, front and side airbags, and a <b>safety</b> <b>cage</b> — a horseshoe-like structure around the passenger compartment.|$|R
50|$|After {{the birth}} of the shifter kart in 2002, many people decided to build their own {{motorcycle}} powered karts. Anything from a Honda CBR to a Yamaha R1 engine is used. Motorcycle powered karts, such as the Gixxer Kart, should only be driven on a closed circuit race track by professional drivers. With no protection such as seatbelt or <b>Safety</b> <b>cage,</b> it can be extremely dangerous.|$|R

Suspension consists of twin wishbones with Proflex dampers. The body styling has been done by Keith Burden and Tom Webster. It appears that some components of the vehicle have been taken from existing production cars, the doorline in particular appears very close to that of the Ford Ka.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to perform a {{detailed}} design analysis on a conceptually designed preliminary flight trainer. The Triton 2 (1 B) must meet the current regulations in FAR Part 23. The detailed design process included the tasks of sizing load carrying members, pulleys, bolts, rivets, and fuselage skin for the <b>safety</b> <b>cage,</b> empennage, and control systems. In addition to the regulations in FAR Part 23, the detail design had to meet established minimums for environmental operating conditions and material corrosion resistance...|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} {{vehicles}} has also evolved to improve protection after collision, both for vehicle occupants {{and for those}} outside of the vehicle. Much of this work was led by automotive industry competition and technological innovation, leading to measures such as Saab's <b>safety</b> <b>cage</b> and reinforced roof pillars of 1946, Ford´s 1956 Lifeguard safety package, and Saab and Volvo's introduction of standard fit seatbelts in 1959. Other initiatives were accelerated {{as a reaction to}} consumer pressure, after publications such as Ralph Nader's 1965 book Unsafe at Any Speed accused motor manufacturers of indifference towards safety.|$|R

5000|$|Initial {{models were}} fitted {{at the rear}} with swing-down and -up doors (like utes), but later models came {{equipped}} with [...] "barn-door" [...] configurations that opened out {{to the sides of}} the vehicle, rather than down, aiding the loading of bulky freight into the vehicle without (as badly) damaging the body. Passengers could climb from the interior passenger cab into the cargo bay behind them easily. Later the installation of <b>safety</b> <b>cages</b> which segregated passengers from the cargo area became popular to prevent freight from the back sliding into the passenger cab (and potentially injuring the driver).|$|R
2500|$|In {{the side}} garden {{there is a}} raised lawn, with a minibeast {{trapdoor}} laid on the bare earth. [...] This allows small invertebrates to shelter under it, and children can expose them by lifting the trapdoor. [...] The trapdoor is light enough for a five-year-old to lift easily. Slugs, snails, earthworms, woodlouse and millipedes are likely inhabitants here. On the lawn is another animal hutch, a <b>safety</b> <b>cage</b> for beehives - disused due to colony collapse disorder - and a shed with batboxes fixed to the side.
