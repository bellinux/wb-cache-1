5|$|A 2001 {{report by}} Newell et al. at Southampton University {{undertaken}} for Studio Sound in 2001 {{found that the}} NS-10 had excellent time-domain response at low frequencies – its ability to start and stop in response to signal input {{was found to be}} superior to that of most other nearfield monitors. Part of this was related to its closed-box design. The researchers held that the extremely fast decay time of the speaker in the low frequencies ensures that the bass instruments (guitar and drums) are correctly <b>balanced</b> <b>in</b> the mix.|$|E
5|$|Reductions in {{the size}} of host populations may cause a {{long-lasting}} reduction of louse taxonomic richness, for example, birds introduced into New Zealand host fewer species of lice there than in Europe. Louse sex ratios are more <b>balanced</b> <b>in</b> more social hosts and more female-biased in less social hosts, presumably due to the stronger isolation among louse subpopulations (living on separate birds) in the latter case. The extinction of a species results in the extinction of its host-specific lice. Host-switching is a random event that would seem very rarely likely to be successful, but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time-scales so it must be successfully accomplished sometimes.|$|E

5|$|A bike is also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is more easily <b>balanced</b> <b>in</b> the hand than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to fall over) will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike which is just as tall but with a lower center of mass. This {{is an example of a}} vertical second-class lever. A small force at the end of the lever, the seat or handlebars at the top of the bike, more easily moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where the tires touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, {{along with}} the {{majority}} of the 2nd AIF, the 2/9th was withdrawn to Australia in response to the threat posed by Japan's entry into the war following the attacks on Pearl Harbor and in Malaya. Returning via Bombay and Colombo, the 2/9th arrived in Australia, landing in Port Adelaide, South Australia, in March 1942 and from there proceeded to camp in Sandy Creek, near Gawler. The battalion remained there until April when it was moved to Tenterfield, New South Wales, and then Kilcoy, Queensland, where it carried out training prior to departure overseas. At this time, the strategic situation in the Pacific was finely <b>balanced.</b> <b>In</b> July, the Japanese had landed on the northern New Guinea coast and had begun advancing along the Kokoda Track towards Port Moresby, amidst heavy fighting. On 6 August 1942, the order to deploy came and the battalion embarked from Brisbane {{along with the}} rest of the 18th Brigade, bound for Milne Bay in New Guinea where the 2/9th arrived on 21 August to help reinforce the garrison there, due concerns about a possible Japanese landing there to secure the adjacent airfields.|$|E

40|$|Impaired {{balance is}} often seen in elderly and can result in {{impaired}} mobility and finally in falling. Failure of compensation strategies or deterioration of underlying systems involved <b>in</b> standing <b>balance</b> could result <b>in</b> impaired <b>balance.</b> To apply targeted interventions to improve balance, {{it is important to}} know the underlying cause of impaired <b>balance.</b> <b>In</b> this thesis, it is shown that the underlying systems involved <b>in</b> <b>balance,</b> represented by muscle characteristics, blood pressure and cognition, are all associated with the ability to maintain standing <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> elderly outpatients. However, the quality of standing balance, determined using force plates measuring ground reaction forces, is not associated with the underlying systems involved <b>in</b> standing <b>balance.</b> Therefore, it is not possible to detect the underlying cause of impaired <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> elderly outpatients using aforementioned measures. System identification techniques are introduced to identify the contribution of the underlying systems <b>in</b> standing <b>balance.</b> <b>In</b> this thesis, the method is validated and it is shown that it is possible to identify the underlying systems involved <b>in</b> standing <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> elderly. This gives the opportunity to use this method to unravel the underlying cause of impaired <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> elderly and therefore to apply targeted interventions and reduce falling.

The Leonberger's ears rise from halfway between the eye and the top of his skull to level with the top of his skull. Though level bites and slight anomalies not affecting the robustness of the lower jaw are common, the ideal Leonberger capably possesses a strong scissor bite with full dentition.|$|E
25|$|According to the Christian Heritage Academy website, {{the school}} began in 1972 {{with a vision}} of Sunnyside Baptist Church and its pastor, Harry Boydstun. Prior to the school's founding, {{demographic}} changes in primary education were taking place in Oklahoma City and in other cities across America. In the 1971 Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education ruling, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of busing to end school segregation and dual school systems. The federal courts began mandating that enrollment be racially <b>balanced</b> <b>in</b> the public school systems and be achieved through the forced busing of elementary students. Many parents were alarmed that the public schools were being radically reorganized and their children would be transported miles across town to be taught in some other place than their neighborhood schools. The movement {{of large numbers of}} white families to suburbs of large cities, so-called white flight and a string of Supreme Court decisions, reduced the effectiveness of the busing policy.|$|E
25|$|The {{exponential}} horn has an acoustic loading property {{that allows the}} speaker driver to remain evenly <b>balanced</b> <b>in</b> output level over its frequency range. The benefits of the design were first published by C.R. Hanna and J. Slepian in 1924 for the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE). A major drawback is that the {{exponential horn}} allows for a narrowing of the radiation pattern as frequency increases, making for high frequency 'beaming' on axis and dull sound off axis. Another concern is that a throat of small diameter is needed for high efficiency at high frequencies but a larger throat is best for low frequencies. A common solution is to use two or more horns, each with the appropriate throat size, mouth size and flare rate for best performance in a selected frequency range, with sufficient overlap between the frequency ranges to provide a smooth transition between horns. Another solution tried in the late 1930s by Harry F. Olson of RCA was to use multiple exponential flare rates, either by connecting increasingly larger horns in series or by subdividing {{the interior of a}} single horn. Exponential horns continue to be used by some designers, and in some applications.|$|E

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in developing a conceptual understanding {{of the experience of}} <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> everyday life, from an occupational perspective. The {{purpose of this study was}} to gain insights about <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> the everyday lives of women with stress-related disorders. Data were gathered from 19 women who were past the first phase of recovery from a stress-related disorder and participated in one of five focus groups. Analysis revealed that the participants experienced a continuum between imbalance and <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> everyday life. The themes that emerged were image of occupational self, strategies to manage and control everyday life, occupational repertoire, and occupational experience. <b>Balance</b> <b>in</b> everyday life was achieved through a dynamic interaction between these themes, which the women characterised as respecting their own values, needs, and resources; having strategies to manage and control everyday life; having a harmonious occupational repertoire; and engaging in personally meaningful occupation. Engagement in personally meaningful occupation appears to be a mechanism that enables people to achieve <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> everyday life by enabling them to develop a successful occupational selfimage, manageability, control, and a harmonious occupational repertoire.

25|$|In early {{times the}} choir alone possessed seats, the nave being left bare. Gradually benches were introduced, {{and during the}} 15th century became universal. The poppyhead form of B {{ornament}} now reached perfection and was constantly used enc for seats other {{than those of the}} choir. The name refers en a. to the carved finial which is so often used to complete the top of the bench end and is peculiarly English in character. In Devon and Cornwall it is rarely met with (Ilsington, Devon). In Somerset it is more common, while in the eastern counties thousands of examples remain. The quite simple fleur-de-lys form of poppyhead, suitable for the village, is seen in perfection at Trunch, Norfolk, and the very elaborate form when the poppyhead springs from a crocketed circle filled in with sculpture, at St Nicholas, King's Lynn. Often the foliage contained a face (St Margaret's, Cley, Norfolk), or the poppyhead consisted of figures or birds only (Thurston, Suffolk) or a figure standing on a dragon (Great Brincton, Northampton); occasionally the traditional form was departed from and the finial carved like a lemon in outline (Bury St Edmuncis) or a diamond (Tirley, Glos.). In Denmark an ornament {{in the form of a}} large circle sometimes takes the place of the English poppy-head. In the Copenhagen Museum there is a set of bench ends of the 15th century with such a decoration carved with coats of arms, interlacing strap-work, etc. But the old 15th-century bench end did not depend entirely on the poppy-head for its embellishment. The side was constantly enriched with elaborate tracery (Dennington, Norfolk) or with tracery and domestic scenes (North Cadbury, Somerset), or would consist of a mass of sculpture in perspective, with canopy work, buttresses and sculptured niches, while the top of the bench end would be crowned with figures carved in the round, of the finest craftsmanship. Such work at Amiens cathedral is a marvel alike of conception, design and execution. In the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin some beautiful stall ends are to be seen. Out of a dragons mouth grows a conventional tree arranged and <b>balanced</b> <b>in</b> excellent proportion. On another, stall end a tree is carved growing out of the mouth of a fool. This custom of making foliage grow out of the mouth or eyes is hardly defensible, and was by no means confined to any country or time. We have plenty of Renaissance examples of the same treatment.|$|E
