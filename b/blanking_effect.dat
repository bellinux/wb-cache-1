40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the code tracking {{performance in the}} presence of signal blanking in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). The <b>blanking</b> <b>effect</b> is usually caused by buildings that obscure the signal in either a periodic or random manner. In some cases, ideal blanking is used to remove random or periodic interference. Nevertheless, the effect of temporary discontinuity of signal often leads to the tracking and position error. To analyze this problem, three types of blanking model are considered: no blanking, periodic blanking, and random blanking of the signals input into the code tracking loop. The mean time to lose lock (MTLL) is to assess the performance of code tracking system under signal blanking. Finally, the effect of steady-state tracking errors on the performance of tracking loop resulting from blanking environment is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} spatial {{cooperative}} diversity and decision-making technique to enhance signal detection and indoor mobile robot positioning {{performance of a}} global positioning satellite system (GNSS) receiver. Though the adaptive antenna array technique in early research could effectively promote antijamming freedom, overcome time-varying system, and mitigate narrowband and wideband interferences, {{factors such as the}} decrease of signal magnitude caused by obstacles (especially in the indoor environment), multipath, and <b>blanking</b> <b>effect</b> caused by the change in antenna direction with the motion of mobile robot can degrade the detection and interference mitigation performance of GNSS receivers. This paper aims to develop a dynamic cooperative scheme to proceed with the switch, selection, combination, and optimization among antennas. In addition, a signal processing experimental platform is also established to receive actually indoor GNSS signals for verification. The proposed scheme is capable of effectively promoting the postcorrelation signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) capability of a GNSS receiver under the indoor environment...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Three {{total protein}} assays were {{analyzed}} {{to determine the}} extent of deviation encountered when a constant measured reagent blank is compared to a continuously decreasing true reagent <b>blank.</b> This <b>blank</b> <b>effect</b> owes its regressive nature to the consumption of the active reagent ingredient by the protein reactive species, variably and sometimes, with certain reactants, nonlinearly in the presence of increasing protein concentrations. However, the <b>blank</b> <b>effect</b> of interest here is apparent only when the reagent and the reagent-protein complex present overlapping spectra and therefore absorb at the wavelength of measurement. Thus it was found that while the biuret and the Coomassie brilliant blue assays produced pronounced differences in the variable true reagent blanks, the Folin-Ciocalteau reaction did not develop a deviation from the true blank since the reagent blank does not absorb to any extent at the assay wavelength. In this manner, the latter procedure could serve äs a marker against which the former two blank reactions can be shown to display relatively excessive deviations.

40|$|A rapid {{radioimmunoassay}} {{for determining}} progesterone levels in unextracted bovine plasma has been developed. Two antisera have been tested, anti-deoxycorticosterone- 21 -hemisuccinate human serum albumin and antiprogesterone- 11 -hemisuccinate bovine serum albumin. The usefulness of an antiserum for rapid assays {{has been based}} on its agreement with assays of organic extracts or chromatographically purified extracts of selected bovine samples. To avoid large <b>blank</b> <b>effects</b> and non-specific interference, a plasma volume of 20 microliter that provided adequate sensitivity was not exceeded. All correlations between rapid assays, assays using organic extraction or assays after chromatographic purification were greater than 0. 9 and showed regression slopes approximating unity. It was concluded that individual lots of antisera should be evaluated thoroughly before use in a rapid assay...|$|R
50|$|The One-Eleven prototype, {{flown by}} test pilot Mike Lithgow, crashed on 22 October during stall testing, {{with the loss}} of all on board. The {{investigation}} led to the discovery of what became known as deep stall or superstall, a phenomenon caused by reduced airflow to the tailplane caused by the combined <b>blanking</b> <b>effects</b> of the wing and the aft-mounted engine nacelles at high angles of attack, which prevents recovery of normal (nose-down) flight. To prevent such stalls, BAC designed and added devices known as stick shakers and stick pushers to the One-Eleven's control system. It also redesigned the wing's leading edge to smooth airflow into the engines and over the tailplane. The specially modified aircraft used for testing this problem is now preserved at Brooklands Museum.|$|R

40|$|Bile acid {{kinetics}} {{involve the}} measurement of pool sizes and turnover rates of individual bile acids. The technique is based on isotope dilution and was first described in the 1950 s using radioactive C- 14 -labelled cholic acid (CA). It took until the 1970 s before stable isotopes were introduced for this purpose (C- 13, H- 2) and isotope analysis methods were developed for CA and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) applying gas chromatography/electron impact mass spectrometry. Until the 1980 s, the isotope enrichment measurements were performed in bile samples aspirated from the duodenum. Thereafter, methodology became available allowing measurements to be performed in blood requiring at least 2 ml serum samples. Simultaneous measurement of kinetics of metabolically dependent CA and deoxycholic acid using C- 13 and H- 2 labels was introduced. Until the 1990 s, this technique was only possible in adult humans due to the large sample sizes. Introduction of pentafluorobenzyl bromide derivatisation and electron capture negative ion mass spectrometry (GC/ECN-MS) reduced the sample volume to 50 mu l serum. This allowed isotope abundance measurement of CA in rats and in mice. However, repetitive collection of 100 mu l blood samples in mice is too invasive (collection via the orbita) and exhaustive. Therefore, the method development is now focussing on enhanced sensitivity and reduction of <b>blank</b> <b>effects</b> originating from the sample preparation. The final goal is to determine CA isotope enrichments in 20 mu l mouse blood obtained from the tail vein. This paper shows the feasibility of reaching this goal...|$|R
40|$|Stability in gut {{ecosystems}} is {{an important}} area of study that impacts {{on the use of}} additives and is related with several pathologies. Kefir is a fermented milk drink made with a consortium of yeast and bacteria as a fermentation starter, of which the use as additive in companion and livestock animals has increased in the last few years. To investigate the effect of kefir milk on foregut and hindgut digestive systems, an in vitro approach was followed. Either rumen fluid or horse fecal contents were used as a microbial inoculate and the inclusion of kefir (fresh, autoclaved, or pasteurized) was tested. Gas production over 72 h of incubation was recorded and pH, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), lactate and ammonia concentration as well as lactic acid (LAB) and acetic acid bacteria, and yeast total numbers were also measured. Both direct and indirect (by subtracting their respective <b>blanks)</b> <b>effects</b> were analyzed and a multivariate analysis was performed to compare foregut and hindgut fermentation models. Addition of kefir boosted the fermentation by increasing molar concentration of VFAs and ammonia and shifting the Acetate to Propionate ratio in both models but heat processing techniques like pasteurization or autoclaving influenced the way the kefir is fermented and reacts with the present microbiota. In terms of comparison between both models, the foregut model seems to be less affected by the inclusion of Kefir than the hindgut model. In terms of variability in the response, the hindgut model appeared to be more variable than the foregut model in the way that it reacted indirectly to the addition of different types of kefir.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a method to}} compensate for the blanking time distortion in Space Vector Modulated (SVM) voltage source inverters. Blanking time distortion is caused by the delay inserted to prevent the short circuit that would occur if the two transistors in the same inverter leg are both on at the same time. This delay produces harmonic distortion and non-linearity when two-switch phase legs are used in inverters to generate sinusoidal voltages for various types of AC loads. The approach in this thesis uses a Field Programmable Gate Array to create a pulse by pulse compensation technique that adjusts the symmetric SVM pulses in an attempt to eliminate the voltage distortion caused by the <b>blanking</b> time <b>effect.</b> This technique is evaluated through simulation and experimental results. This thesis proves that the delay caused by the insertion of blanking time can be compensated using a Field Programmable Gate Array and that the blanking time delay is not the dominant source of the 5 th and 7 th lower order harmonic distortion in voltage source inverters at low voltages.

40|$|Abstract. A {{simplified}} (one step) method called “inverse approach ” (IA) for {{the numerical}} analysis of the stamping process has been continuously developed by the authors {{since the end of}} the eighties. In the present paper we recall the main finite element formulation aspects, for an efficient estimation of the large elastoplastic strains encountered in deep drawing operations. The capabilities of the code Fast_Stamp include: fixed (imposed) initial <b>blank,</b> bending <b>effects</b> due to tool curvatures, blankholder restraining forces (including drawbeads). Considerations of bending and unbending during forming stages can improve the IA regarding stresses distribution. In this case satisfactory estimation of springback can result. Since 1996 we also developed “math based ” optimization algorithms and strategies. The cost functions and constraints are mainly expressed to reduce or control the thickness changes, the localized necking, the wrinkling tendency, the springback after forming. The design variables are describing the shape of the blank, the additional (addendum) surfaces, the restraining forces due to drawbeads and the material properties such as anisotropy coefficient and hardening exponent. Optimization algorithms are mainly based on surface response techniques with moving least square approximation and SQP to find the optimum solution at each iteration. Selected results will be presented related to the design of additional surfaces...|$|R
30|$|The Spearman {{correlation}} between the eight weekly sPGA change scores and NVSA© change scores ranged from 0.14 to 0.43 for number of days of vomiting or nausea per week (mean and median of 0.28 and 0.29, respectively), 0.09 to 0.58 for number of episodes of vomiting per week (mean and median of 0.28 and 0.29, respectively), and 0.14 to 0.49 for mean severity of nausea (mean and median of 0.34 and 0.38, respectively). Even though a small handful of the 21 calculated correlations were small―and perhaps meaningless (i.e., the single observed correlation of 0.09)―a broader gestalt view of the 21 correlations suggested that, by standard criteria [42, 43], the sPGA represents a marginally-acceptable criteria for assessing ability to detect change in the NVSA© scores.

Sulfadiazine (SDZ) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) were selected for this purpose for being the most representative compounds of this group. The template molecules were imprinted in sol–gel (ISG) and the resulting material was used as detecting element. This was made by employing it as either a sensing layer or an ionophore of PVC-based membranes and subsequent potentiometric transduction, a strategy never reported before. The corresponding non-imprinted sol–gel (NISG) membranes were used as <b>blank.</b> The <b>effect</b> of plasticizer and kind/charge of ionic lipophilic additive was also studied. The best performance in terms of slope, linearity ranges and signal reproducibility and repeatability was achieved by PVC membranes including a high dielectric constant plasticizer and 15 mg of ISG particles. The corresponding average slope was − 51. 4 and − 52. 4 mV/decade, linear responses were 9. 0 × 10 − 6 and 1. 7 × 10 − 5 M, and limits of detection were 0. 74 and 1. 3 μg/mL for SDZ and for SMX, respectively.

40|$|Tailor welded blanks (TWBs) {{are used}} in the {{automotive}} industries as a method to meet economic, environmental and governmental demands. Conventionally, TWBs incorporated mild and low strength steels such as interstitial free and draw quality steels because of their excellent formability traits. However, due to their low strength they are unsuitable for energy absorption applications; thus, the interest of incorporating advanced high strength steels (AHSS) into the TWBs. Dual phase (DP) steel is a type of AHSS that is of interest because of its combination of high strength and good formability that is comparable to high strength low alloy (HSLA) steels. However, welding DP steel causes softening in the heat affected zone (HAZ), which leads to premature failure and reduces formability.

Doped standards exhibit signal enhancements (Cd, Ag, Zn and Cu), instrumental mass bias changes and inaccurate isotopic compositions relative to undoped standards, {{all of which are}} attributed to the combined presence of resin-derived organics and inorganics. The matrix effect associated with the inorganic component of the column blanks was evaluated separately by doping standards with metals at the trace levels detected in the column <b>blanks.</b> Mass bias <b>effects</b> introduced by the inorganic column blank matrix are smaller than for the bulk column blank matrix but can still lead to significant changes in ion signal intensity, instrumental mass bias and isotopic ratios. Chemical treatment with refluxed HNO(3) or HClO(4) /HNO(3) removes resin-derived organic components resulting in matrix effects similar in magnitude to those associated with the inorganic component of the column blank. Mass bias correction using combined external normalization-SSB does not correct for these matrix effects because the instrumental mass biases experienced by Cd and Zn are decoupled from those of Ag and Cu, respectively.

This is a typical functionally graded materials (FGM) structure and has been studied extensively for structural applications under multiple loadings such as thermal and electromagnetic fields in recent years. For acoustic wave resonators, such studies are equally important and the wave propagation in FGM structures can be used in the evaluation and assessment of performance, reliability, and life of sensors based on acoustic waves such as the quartz crystal microbalances (QCM). Now we studied the thickness-shear vibrations of FGM plates with properties of AT-cut quartz crystal varying along the thickness in a general pattern represented by a trigonometric function with both sine and cosine functions of the thickness coordinate. The solutions are obtained by using Fourier expansion of the plate deformation. We also obtained the frequency changes of the fundamental and overtone modes which are strongly coupled for the evaluation of resonator structures with property variation or design to take advantages of FGM in novel applications.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the NiS fire assay, incorporating Te coprecipitation with ICP-MS quantification, procedure for {{the determination of}} the Platinum Group Elements (PGE) and gold (Au) in geological materials, with the aim of improving the method. The general analytical methods for {{the determination of the}} precious metals are reviewed. [...] The sensitivity of an analytical procedure is much influenced by the choice of the determinative step. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) offers a precise, accurate method with low limits of detection for quantification of the PGE and Au. However, inherent in the ICP-MS are problems such as ionic interferences, memory, matrix and drift. The matrix effects of HCI, HNO₄ and Te on the sensitivity of the precious metals using ICP-MS were studied. Within the concentration range examined, the sensitivities of the internal standards (Cd and TI), PGE and Au were found to depend most strongly on the concentration of HCI. The reduction of HCI concentration from 0. 6 M to 0. 2 M provides about 20 % enhancement in the sensitivities of the internal standards, and the PGE. [...] The effects of reducing the quantity of Ni and S used in the NiS fire assay method on the recovery of PGE and Au was investigated in a Pt ore grade sample and a low ppb level sample. In the Pt ore grade sample, the recovery of the precious metals was found not to depend on the mass of Ni used as collector. However, the recovery of Ru, Rh, Pd and Pt in the low ppb level sample was found to be a function of the collector mass used, while the recovery of Os, Ir and Au in the low ppb level sample was not. To explain this behaviour of the PGE, a model equation was derived from the mass balance equation of PGE between the sulphide and silicate liquids, and the bulk partitioning coefficient equation. From this equation, the partition coefficients (D) of the PGE were determined. The D values were also independently determined by analysis of the PGE and Au contents of the sulphide and silicate phases. The D values were functions of PGE concentrations. The D values obtained for a Pt ore grade sample were 4 to 103 times higher than those for the low ppb level sample. D values for Ni, Cu and Cr are also reported. [...] To improve PGE recovery in low ppb samples and to lower reagent blanks, further studies were undertaken. The NiS bead was dissolved in a closed vessel with a smaller amount of HCI, and the quantity of Te (and SnCI₂) used for the coprecipitation of PGE was also reduced significantly to lessen the total dissolved solids in the analytical solution. [...] An improved method has been developed, which offers good precision and acceptable accuracy for the determination of PGE and Au concentration in geological materials. The reagent <b>blank,</b> matrix <b>effect</b> due to HCI, cost of chemicals and sample processing time have been reduced...|$|R
40|$|Blank holder is {{the most}} {{important}} part in making drawing experiment and one of vital elements in preventing the wrinkling defect from occurring. During drawing process, the constant role of blank holder is desirable to deal with wrinkling defect. Regarding this, through varying force strength in force in <b>blank</b> holder, the <b>effect</b> of <b>blank</b> holder force on the result of cup drawing process could be revealed. This research started with preparing dies with specified parameter, by adding four holes into blank holder and four bolt taps into dies, to be used as varying blank holder strength later. There were three varying blank holder strengths: 2. 352 Nm, 1. 7652 Nm and 0. 12 Nm in each of its bolts. This research employed cup drawing research method with cylindrical-shaped plate. The product yielded was a cup with upper diameter d 1 : 46 mm, lowed diameter d 2 : 30 mm, and depth h: 15 mm. The tested objects (blanks) used was aluminum plate with ultimate load of 1. 453 Kgf and thickness of 0. 11 mm, zinc plate with ultimate load of 7. 280 Kgf with thickness of 0. 2 mm, aluminum plate (lead plate) with ultimate load of 8. 898 Kgf with thickness of 0. 3 mm and aluminum plate (lead plat) with ultimate load of 10. 528 Kgf with thickness of 0. 32 mm. Diameter of tested objects (blanks) was 64. 8 mm. The result of research showed that the best result occurred in plate with ultimate load of 10. 528 Kgf, thickness of 0. 32 mm and black holder strength of 2. 352 Nm. Meanwhile, the plate with ultimate load of 1. 453 Kgf and thickness of 0. 1 mm encountered torn defect in all of experiments. And the comparison of experiments with and without lubrication found that the effect of friction coefficient on wrinkling defect, the experiment with lubrication had lower wrinkling defect result compared with the one without lubrication...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{explore the}} effect of {{estradiol}} on human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and the therapeutic effect of estradiol-pretreated BMSCs on liver cirrhosis in mice. MethodsThird-passage BMSCs were divided into control (untreated with estradiol) and experimental groups (treated with different concentrations of estradiol); {{the effect of}} estradiol on the proliferative activity of BMSCs was measured by MTT assay. Apoptosis was induced by H 2 O 2 in the control and experimental groups of BMSCs, with normal BMSCs as the <b>blank</b> group; the <b>effect</b> of estradiol on apoptosis in BMSCs was tested by trypan blue staining and quantitative real-time PCR of caspase- 3 mRNA. Forty-six normal male C 57 BL mice were assigned to control, model, BMSC transplantation, and estradiol-pretreated BMSC transplantation groups. An animal model of liver cirrhosis was established by intraperitoneal injection of CCl 4. At 12 weeks after CCl 4 injection, estradiol-pretreated and untreated BMSCs were transplanted into mice through the tail vein. At 4 weeks after BMSC transplantation, blood samples were collected for serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) assays. The stage of liver fibrosis was determined by hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining. Type I collagen (collagen I) expression was analyzed by RT-PCR. Normally distributed categorical data (with homogeneous variances) were analyzed using ANOVA, followed by pairwise comparisons using LSD test; non-normally distributed data (with heterogeneous variances) were analyzed using Mann-Whitney rank-sum test. ResultsAll the experimental groups had higher proliferative activity {{than the control group}} (F= 730. 08, P= 0. 000). H 2 O 2 promoted apoptosis in BMSCs, with lower apoptosis rate in the experimental groups than in the control group (F= 258. 34, P= 0. 000). Caspase- 3 mRNA expression wassignificantly different between the control and experimental groups (F= 50. 29, P= 0. 000). Additionally, there were significant differences in rats between the model, BMSC transplantation, and estradiol-pretreated BMSC transplantation groups in terms of ALT (P= 0. 000 for all), AST(P＜ 0. 05 for all), fiber ratio (P＜ 0. 05 for all), and collagen I mRNA expression (P＜ 0. 05 for all). ConclusionEstradiol promotes the proliferation and reduces H 2 O 2 -induced apoptosis in BMSCs. BMSCs can improve liver cirrhosis and their therapeutic effect is enhanced by estradiol pretreatment...|$|R
40|$|High-precision isotopic {{analysis}} of Cu in blood serum via multi-collector ICP-mass spectrometry (MCICP-MS) {{has recently been}} shown valuable for diagnosis and prognosis of diseases affecting Cu metabolism. However, {{as a result of}} the low Cu concentration (# 2 mg L- 1) in blood serum compared to the high contents of concomitant matrix elements (e. g., similar to 3000 mg L- 1 Na, similar to 1000 mg L- 1 S, similar to 100 mg L- 1 Ca and similar to 20 mg L- 1 Mg) and the measurable effect that the matrix typically exerts on the extent of instrumental mass discrimination in MC-ICP-MS, an exhaustive sample preparation protocol is required. In this work, an alternative procedure for Cu isolation from serum prior to isotope ratio measurement by MC-ICP-MS was evaluated. This procedure involves removal of the alkali and earth alkaline metals using 1 mL of Chelex- 100 chelating ion exchange resin, followed by further purification of the Cu-fraction using 250 mu L of AG MP 1 anion exchange resin. The matrix elements were removed efficiently and Cu recoveries were quantitative in all cases. The alternative Cu isolation procedure showed several advantages compared to the conventional procedure, e. g., (i) a reduction in the amount of acids, cost and time required and (ii) lower <b>blank</b> levels. The <b>effect</b> of (remaining) concomitant matrix elements on the Cu isotope ratio accuracy and precision attainable was evaluated using both the standard interface (combination of standard cones and a large dry interface pump) and the high-transmission 'jet' interface (combination of 'jet' cones and a large dry interface pump). For standard solutions, the jet interface provided a superior internal precision (improved by a factor of 1. 5) for the raw (uncorrected) Cu- 65 /Cu- 63 ratio and a mitigated extent of instrumental mass discrimination. However, the influence of matrix elements on the Cu isotope ratio results was stronger with the jet interface than with the standard interface. The proposed procedure was validated using standards with known isotopic composition, a serum reference material and human serum samples. No statistical differences were obtained (at a 95 % confidence interval) in the delta Cu- 65 values using the proposed and the conventional (two column passes using 1 mL of AG MP 1 resin) procedure. Finally, serum samples collected at different time points during a day from five volunteers were analysed in order to study diurnal variations in the serum Cu isotopic composition. No diurnal variations were established...|$|R
