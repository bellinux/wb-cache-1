5000|$|In the Blackest Night crossover, his remains are reanimated as {{a member}} of the Black Lantern Corps, and he joins the reanimated Jack and Janet Drake, John and Mary Grayson, Tony Zucco, and the {{original}} Batman's deceased rogues gallery members in an attempt to take the life of the current Batman and Red Robin. They are met with interference from Deadman, who had possessed the body of the demon Etrigan. Their attack is ultimately called off when Batman and Red Robin cryogenically freeze themselves, leaving no emotions for the Black Lanterns to target. Harkness later joins other reanimated members of the Rogues to target their still-living members. However, the battle results a draw on both side. Harkness' son, Owen, arrives and takes him away from the battle, believing he can bring his father <b>back.</b> <b>Digger</b> convinces his son that he needs to feed upon the living in order to live so Owen lures people (such as newcomer villain Sandblast) to a pit at a construction site where Digger is waiting. The Rogues track Owen down, Captain Cold berating him on how foolish he is to believe Digger's lies. When they discover the remains of a family nearby, Captain Cold reminds Owen that [...] "the Rogues don't kill women or children." [...] He shoves Owen into the pit where Digger rips out his son's heart. A black ring then flies down to make Owen a Black Lantern. The Black Lantern Harkness and his son are then encased in ice by Captain Cold. Digger manages to escape and join in the mass battle against the heroes where he is brought back to life and rejuvenated. He appears confused as to what is going on before being knocked out by the Flash.|$|E

25|$|Many {{other names}} have been {{ascribed}} to the gray whale, including desert whale, devilfish, gray <b>back,</b> mussel <b>digger</b> and rip sack. The name Eschrichtius gibbosus is sometimes seen; this {{is dependent on the}} acceptance of a 1777 description by Erxleben.|$|R
5000|$|Bantamweight [...] - [...] Digger Stanley, 1910 (retained). Jim Higgins (retained), Johnny Brown (1923-1925) won {{the same}} Lonsdale belt {{outright}}. The NSC bought it <b>back</b> from <b>Digger</b> Stanley's widow after his death. Bugler Lake got one notch on it before losing to Johnny Brown in 1923. Brown {{went on to}} win it outright and retain it. His son, Edward Brown, donated this original belt to the Museum of London in 2010. It can be seen at their Docklands museum.|$|R
5000|$|This first Queensland goldrush {{resulted}} in about 15,000 people flocking to this {{sparsely populated area}} in {{the last months of}} 1858. This was, however, a small goldfield with only shallow gold deposits and with no where near enough gold to sustain the large number of prospectors. This goldrush was given the name of the 'duffer rush' as destitute prospectors [...] "had, in the end, to be rescued by their colonial governments or given charitable treatment by shipping companies" [...] to return home when they did not strike it rich and had used up all their capital. The authorities had expected violence to break-out and had supplied contingents of mounted and foot police as well as war ships. The New South Wales government (Queensland was then part of New South Wales) sent up the [...] "Iris" [...] which remained in Keppel Bay during November to preserve the peace. The Victorian government sent up the [...] "Victoria" [...] with orders to the captain to bring <b>back</b> all Victorian <b>diggers</b> unable to pay their fares; they were to work out their passage money on return to Melbourne. O'Connell had reported that [...] "we have had some trying moments when {{it seemed as if the}} weight of a feather would have turned the balance between comparative order and scenes of great violence", and according to legend both O'Connel and Chapel were threatened with lynching.|$|R
