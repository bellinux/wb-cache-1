40|$|The Daubenton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>bat</b> is {{widespread}} and {{common in the}} UK and countries bordering the English Channel and North Sea. European bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV- 2), a rabies virus, has been detected in Daubenton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>bats</b> in the UK and continental Europe. Investigating the relatedness of colonies and gene flow between these regions would allow regional estimates of the movement of Daubenton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>bats</b> and thus the potential for disease transmission. The genetic structure of the Daubenton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>bat</b> in western Europe was investigated by analysing variability at eight microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity {{was found to be}} high at all sites (HE = 0. 73 - 0. 84), with little differentiation between bats sampled in the UK and continental Europe. Mantel tests indicated a significant correlation between geographic distance and pair-wise FST (P = 0. 000), between colonies sampled in Scotland and northern England. However, this was not continuous throughout the sampled range, with evidence of panmixia within the area sampled in continental Europe. Assignment tests show no evidence that the (potential) EBLV- 2 sero-positive and virus positive bats {{were more likely to have}} originated from the continental rather than UK populations. There is no sufficient significant genetic differentiation amongst most UK and continental colonies to conclude that EBLV- 2 is maintained in the UK by immigration. Results show that it is likely to be maintained at a low endemic level within the UK. The relative genetic uniformity of UK and continental populations implies that there is no migration barrier to EBLV- 2, between these regions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In 1998, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) {{took steps}} to develop a {{scientific}} test methodology to measure and to control baseball bat performance. The resulting standard uses a hitting machine that pitches a ball at a moving bat to measure the BESR (Ball Exit Speed Ratio). Concurrently, the governing body for amateur baseball in Japan developed a test protocol for controlling bat performance. In contrast to the NCAA test methodology, the Japanese protocol uses a series of static tests. This paper compares the two protocol philosophies and presents experimental data highlighting the respective criteria of each approach and discusses how successful each approach has been in controlling nonwood baseball bat performance. Comparison data and analysis showed that some Japanese bats marginally outperformed U. <b>S.</b> <b>bats</b> with respect to batted-ball speed. Despite the lack of direct restriction on batted-ball performance using a dynamic test method, the Japanese regulation is controlling the performance of aluminum bats fairly well...|$|R

The burden of near-roadway air pollution (NRAP) generally has not been examined, despite evidence of a causal link with CHD.; We investigated the CHD burden from NRAP and compared it with the PM 2. 5 burden in the California South Coast Air Basin for 2008 and under a compact urban growth greenhouse gas reduction scenario for 2035.; We estimated the population attributable fraction and number of CHD events attributable to residential traffic density, proximity to a major road, elemental carbon (EC), and PM 2. 5 compared with the expected disease burden if the population were exposed to background levels of air pollution.; In 2008, an estimated 1, 300 CHD deaths (6. 8 % of the total) were attributable to traffic density, 430 deaths (2. 4 %) to residential proximity to a major road, and 690 (3. 7 %) to EC. There were 1, 900 deaths (10. 4 %) attributable to PM 2. 5. Although reduced exposures in 2035 should result in smaller fractions of CHD attributable to traffic density, EC, and PM 2. 5, the numbers of estimated deaths attributable {{to each of these}} exposures are anticipated to increase to 2, 500, 900, and 2, 900, respectively, due to population aging. A similar pattern of increasing NRAP-attributable CHD hospitalizations was estimated to occur between 2008 and 2035.; These results suggest that a large burden of preventable CHD mortality is attributable to NRAP and is likely to increase even with decreasing exposure by 2035 due to vulnerability of an aging population.

Solar energy, with its extraordinary resource base, {{is one of the}} most feasible long-term options for satisfying energy demand with minimal environmental impact. However, solar photovoltaic panels remain expensive and employ materials whose resource bases cannot satisfy global, terawatt-level penetration. This necessitates the development of cheap, earth-abundant semiconductors for solar conversion such as cuprous oxide (Cu₂O). Poor solar energy conversion efficiency (10 nanoseconds, minority carrier diffusion length could easily exceed the film thickness. The photoelectrochemical minority carrier diffusion length measurement achieves success on gallium arsenide test samples, determining flat-band potential, quantum efficiency, and minority carrier diffusion length, paving the way for future Cu₂O measurement.

The character, {{origin and}} palaeoenvironmental {{significance}} of the Wonderkrater spring mound, South Africa. Journal of African Earth Sciences, 58 (1), 115 - 126. Wonderkrater is a spring mound consisting entirely of peat in excess of 8 m thick. It has yielded a pollen record extending back over 35, 000 years, which has provided {{one of the very}} few proxy climatic records for the interior of southern Africa in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. The current investigation of the morphology and sedimentology of the site has revealed that the peat mound formed due to artesian conditions at the spring, but that accumulation of the thick peat succession was made possible because of clastic sedimentation on the surrounding piedmont which in turn was brought about by aggradation on the adjacent Nyl River floodplain. The peat mound has remained elevated relative to the surrounding piedmont for most of the 35, 000 year period. Aggradation of the mound was slower during the Late Pleistocene than the Holocene (0. 06 ? 0. 1 m/ 1000 year and 0. 2 ? 0. 38 m/ 1000 year, respectively). Controlled archaeological excavations yielded a diverse late Pleistocene fauna preserved in peat and sand in the mound. A 1 m thick, coarse sand horizon at the base of the peat deposit contained a rich Middle Stone Age (> 30 k year) lithic assemblage. The MSA sand layer likely represents an arid phase, suggesting the site?s antiquity as a place of refuge for Quaternary animals and the people that hunted them.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{fabricated}} and characterized {{a series}} of thin-film cuprous oxide (Cu₂O) photovoltaic devices. I constructed several different device designs, using sputtered and electrochemically deposited Cu₂O. Characterization was done using XRD, SEM, optical spectroscopy, quantum efficiency, current-voltage, and capacitance-voltage measurements. Then, these devices were modeled using SCAPS- 1 D, a numerical simulation package, as well as MATLAB for analytical solutions. This simulation enabled a quantitative breakdown of efficiency losses in Cu 20 devices. Simulations suggest that low device efficiencies of 0. 3 - 0. 6 % may be explained in part by poor bulk transport properties in the Cu₂O. However, the predominant efficiency loss comes from an unoptimized p-n heterojunction, in which a large negative conduction band offset and structural defects lead to a low built-in voltage and high recombination activity. The effects of interface engineering are demonstrated in experiment and simulation. Broader simulations suggest opportunities for future efficiency improvements towards 10 %. These include the improvement of bulk properties, the selection of alternative pairing materials, novel device structures, {{and the possibility of}} multijunction cells. by Riley Eric <b>Brandt.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> M.)

Indices of crowding and frequency of bat-gate collisions were significantly higher in previously gated and increased substantially in treatment mines following reclamation. Gates appeared especially hazardous to subadults during initial-volancy periods. Increased activity of bats and collisions with gates at mine portals may amplify vulnerability to potential predators. Changes in internal mine microclimates, specifically increased ranges between minima and maxima in temperature and vapor pressure deficits following reclamation varied among treatment mines {{as a function of the}} number of mine openings.
