40|$|AbstractFor {{adhesive}} tapes, {{the strain}} before fracture often exceeds 500 %. Although the maximum stresses are quite modest the high strains to fracture result in impressive fracture energy. Due to hydrostatic stress the fracture process often starts by nucleation of microscopic cracks inside the layer. The final crack path is usually {{close to one}} of the adherends. Repeated experiments are performed both with DCB-specimens and <b>butt-joints.</b> The used adhesive tape is an acrylic foam tape with a thickness of 1. 1 mm and a width of 19 mm. The geometry of the specimen is adapted to the properties of the soft layer. For the DCB-specimen this implies that the length of the specimen is about 1 m. The evaluated cohesive laws from the DCB- specimens give a fracture energy of 2 kN/m and a maximum stress about 0. 5 MPa. For the <b>butt-joints,</b> the evaluated cohesive law corresponds well to the results from the DCB-experiments. However, the strain to fracture is slightly smaller. The stress in these specimens is distributed over a larger area and a nucleated crack rapidly crosses the load bearing area and fails the joint prematurely. For both kinds of experiments the evaluated cohesive laws show a small linear part. After this part there is an almost linear strain-hardening phase until fracture...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} margin preparation design and resin-composite type on microleakage with or without re-application of surface-penetrating sealant. METHODS: Class-I resin-composite restorations were completed for 128 extracted human molars. Half of the margins were beveled, the other half, <b>butt-joint.</b> Half of each group was restored with Filtek-Supreme (FS), the other half with Esthet-X (EX) using their respective adhesive systems. Margins were etched and sealed with a surface-penetrating sealant, Fortify. The samples were stored in water 24 h, and thermocycled (5, 000 cycles, 5 °C- 55 °C). Then, samples were abraded using a toothbrush machine (6, 000 strokes). Half of the restorations from each sealant group (n= 16) were resealed, {{and the other half}} had no further treatment. Thermocycling and tooth brushing were repeated. The samples were sealed with nail polish, immersed in methylene-blue for 8 h, sectioned, and magnified digital photographs were taken. Three examiners assessed dye penetration. A 2 × 2 × 2 multi-layered Chi-Square analysis, using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was conducted for statistical analysis. RESULTS: No difference was observed between sealed and resealed FS and EX restorations with <b>butt-joint</b> margins. In beveled margins, resealing caused significantly less microleakage (P 3 ̆c. 01). No differences were found between restorations either sealed or resealed with bevel margins.

Methods: In a split-mouth design study, 8 mm Ankylos (Dentsply Friadent, Germany) implants {{were placed in}} the second mandibular molar region of 8 adult Macaca fascicularis monkeys about I month after extraction of all mandibular molars. After 3 months of submerged healing, 3 -unit metal bridges were constructed. Clinical data was collected by the author who was blind to the abutment selections. Implants were clinically evaluated using Waite plaque index, sulcus bleeding index, probing pocket depth (PPD), probing attachment loss (PAL), and width of keratinized mucosa at baseline (BL) and 3 -month and 6 -month intervals. Stability of the implant was assessed using Periotest device at BL and after 6 months. Results: At BL, all the clinical variables did not differ statistically between the tapered and the <b>butt-joint</b> groups except for PPD (P < 0. 05), where the meat? PPD was greater in the <b>butt-joint</b> group (2. 75 +/- 1. 02 mm) as compared with the tapered group (1. 97 +/- 0. 65 mm). At the 3 -month assessment, {{there was no difference in}} all clinical variables. After 6 -month loading, no significant difference between these 2 groups was detected in all these variables, with the exception of PAL (P = 0. 05) where mean PAL was greater for implants with the <b>butt-joint</b> abutments (0. 91 +/- 0. 86 mm) in comparison with the tapered abutments (0. 50 +/- 0. 88 mm), and mean Periotest values (PTVs) that indicate the tapered-abutment implants (PTV = - 4. 5 +/- 1. 60) were more stable than butt-joint-abutment implants (PTV = - 1. 5 +/- 3. 59) with P < 0. 05.

40|$|The {{potential}} of metal organic MBE for selective deposition of InP/GaInAsP passive optical waveguide structures was studied for butt coupling with an active laser waveguide. By use of appropriate ex-situ and in-situ preparation {{procedures of the}} masked laser surfaces and high V/III ratios during regrowth virtually ideal <b>butt-joints</b> without any significant deterioration of the topography near the lateral interface and minimum lateral separation between the active and the passive waveguide were achieved. In addition, besides the absence of gas phase pre-reactions during MOMBE, careful ex-situ surface cleaning helped to reduce the growth temperature to as low as 485 degrees C without loss of selectivity. Such a low deposition temperature results in suppression of dopant movement during growth of semi-insulating Fe doped waveguides. SIMS measurements revealed laterally homogeneous incorporation behaviour of the Fe dopant in the waveguide layers without any accumulation at the lateral laser/waveguide interface {{as well as any}} detectable Fe indiffusion into the laser region. Device quality of the deposition process was evaluated from the characteristics of Fabry-Perot lasers comprising an active and a passive waveguide section. Only a small increase of the threshold current by some 30 % for a 600 mu m long passive section as compared to a bare laser demonstrates the applicability of the fabricated butt-joint in photonic ICs.

40|$|High-strength {{steel grades}} with high wear {{resistance}} and high toughness are potential candidates to reduce weight in heavy construction, agricultural machinery and shipbuilding. Weldability of HSS grades has limitations {{due to the}} loss of material properties caused by the complex thermomechanical treatments (i. e. increase of hardness and reduction of toughness caused by martensite formation within the weld seam and the resulting increment of the cold crack probability). The existing limitations can be overcome by the use of appropriate welding methods, such as laser welding combined with induction heating. In the present work, the effect of inductive heating on the microstructure and mechanical properties of fusion and heat-affected zones in <b>butt-joints</b> of the structural steel S 690 QL (3. 0 - 6. 0 mm sheet thicknesses) produced by CO(ind 2) laser welding is studied by optical microscopy and hardness measurements. The results reveal that laser welding without induction heating causes heavy martensite formation in the fusion and heat affected zones, which results in a strong increase of hardness when compared with the parent material. Inductive annealing produces tempered martensite in the fusion zone, thus, leading to a significant and homogeneous reduction of hardness. The effect decreases with increasing sheet thickness. The most promising results are obtained by induction pre- and post-heat-treatments, where the hardness in the fusion zone is similar to that found in the parent material for both thin and thick sheets. However, the hardness distribution is not homogeneous and thermal martensite is formed in the heat-affected zone due to still fast cooling times...|$|E

The adhesive system was studied under both ambient and hostile, (water immersion at 50 °C) conditions. The environmental stability of the system was investigated using two different mechanical tests, (simple <b>butt-joints</b> and a modified Boeing wedge test). In each case, the precise locus of failure was determined {{by a combination of}} surface analytical (XPS and ToF-SIMS) and microscopy techniques, (SEM). On the basis of these results, adhesion and failure mechanisms are proposed for the system. The presence of defects within the adhesive was found to initiate failure under ambient, (dry) conditions. Prolonged immersion in water, (for at least 2 weeks), was found to result in near-interfacial failure with a thin, (of the order of nanometres), overlayer of polymer remaining {{on the surface of the}} adherend. Subtle differences between this polymer overlayer and the bulk resin were observed. A model is proposed in which one of the minor resin components aggregates at the inorganic surface, creating a localised region which is extremely hydrophillic in nature. This makes the system particularly vulnerable to attack by water. In order to test this model, a reformulated batch of resin underwent the same environmental tests. The modified resin displayed a modest improvement in its ability to withstand hostile conditions, (prolonged immersion in water at 50 °C) and the polymer residue remaining on the inorganic substrate was identical to that of the bulk polymer. This project has provided a unique opportunity to study the adhesion of a specific class of adhesives to bulk ceramic oxides, rather than to oxides of metals. One of the major benefits of which, was therefore the absence of any effects due to corrosion of the substrate.

The recovery of veneer, the main material of LVL, are higher than sawn-timber and their drying process are faster. LVL produced with a continuous press has been approved as an engineered material with reliable strength and stiffness. In a wooden boat processing, the easy forming into a curve shape and strength are main factor, because of the streamline shape of boats. LVL material is able to meet those requirements. As an endless-length LVL is made from a log limited-length hence LVL always contain joints. Butt joint have numerous drawbacks, but they are inherently simple and less time to manufacture than other joints types. The purposes of this experiment are to investigate the basic characteristics of LVL which are important for deck and hull planking in the wooden boat constructions. Yellow meranti and red meranti were peeled by a veneer lathe and phenol formaldehyde adhesive were used. Result of experiment indicated that at the position 0 o (β), the flexibility and strength of LVL up to proportional limit increased with increasing number of layer and spacing of <b>butt-joint</b> (d/t). LVL at the position 45 o and 90 o (β), all types of LVL had lower flexibility and strength than the standard value for deck and hull planking. In bending experiment test speciment at position 45 ° with direction of grain, maximum width of LVL equal to the spacing of frame and at position 90 ° equal to the width of hull planking in wooden boat. Based on the interpretations of the above results, {{it can be concluded}} that (1). LVL of 9, 6 and 4 plies with upside (inside) veneer <b>butt-joint</b> is appropriate for deck and hull planking in wooden boat manufacturing, (2). LVL of 9, 6 and 4 plies with spacing of <b>butt-joint</b> (d/t) more than 20 is appropriate for deck and hull planking in manufacturing wooden boat...|$|R
40|$|A GaInAsP {{photonic}} crystal slab microlaser with an integrated passive waveguide was fabricated by a MOCVD <b>butt-joint</b> regrowth process. The {{boundary between the}} active and passive regions was optimized for high light transmission. In addition, {{the edge of the}} waveguide was designed to output a narrow beam, and the light detection was improved. Consequently, a maximum output power of 0. 17 mW was obtained with a differential quantum efficiency of 20 %, which would increase to more than 40 % under ideal detection conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The movability {{and safety}} of an oil can vehicle is {{influenced}} greatly by {{the effect of the}} fixation between the chassis and the vehicle oil can. The <b>butt-joint</b> technology of the chassis and the vehicle oil can is studied in this article, and a new torsion-free-body is designed. The 3 D model of the torsion-free-body is built in Pro/E, and the kinetics analysis of the complex stress point of the torsion-free-body is done in ADAMS, which can provide theoretic guidance for designer to optimize structure design...|$|R
