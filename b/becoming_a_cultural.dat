500|$|What's the Story {{propelled}} Oasis {{from being}} a crossover indie act to a worldwide rock phenomenon after the momentum gained by the critically acclaimed Definitely Maybe. It has been pinpointed by music critics as a significant record in the timeline of British indie music, demonstrating just how far into the mainstream independent music had ventured. In 2005, John Harris noted {{the significance of the}} album and [...] "Wonderwall" [...] in particular to Britpop's legacy. [...] "When (Oasis) released Wonderwall, the rules of British music were decisively changed. From hereon in, the lighter-than-air ballad became obligatory, and the leather-trousers era of rock'n'roll was over." [...] The success of the album in Britain resulted in Oasis <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> ubiquity for a brief period, featuring in tabloid newspapers on an almost daily basis and breaking sales records for live concerts.|$|E
500|$|Robert Hilburn {{from the}} Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "Madonna {{represents}} a contemporary fantasy figure that revives the glamour, innocence and raw sexuality {{of many of}} Madonna's own teen heroes, including Marilyn Monroe and James Dean. Like the early Monroe, Madonna may portray a bimbo, but there she's clearly no pushover. Though the audience was on its feet throughout, it often seemed that Madonna was operating beneath her potential in this pop format. It's important to demonstrate that she can handle herself live, but the simplicity of pop concerts doesn't begin to tax her ambition or talent. In fact, she has so little to do other than express this aggressive, sexy attitude that the show seemed long at just over an hour. Heidi Sherman from Spin commented, [...] "The Virgin Tour was Madonna's first, yet it {{put her in the}} same league as Prince and Bruce Springsteen. It proved that Madonna was beyond real. And if her stage presence indicated she was more showgirl than musician, at least she knew how to gussy up her act for the postfeminist MTV age. Boy Toy? Not exactly. She was a bonafide pop star in the process of <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> icon." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} after Spider-Man's introduction, {{publisher}} Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that issue and was shocked to find {{it was one of}} the nascent Marvel's highest-selling comics. A solo ongoing series followed, beginning with The Amazing Spider-Man #1 (cover-dated March 1963). The title eventually became Marvel's top-selling series with the character swiftly <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> icon; a 1965 Esquire poll of college campuses found that college students ranked Spider-Man and fellow Marvel hero the Hulk alongside Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons. One interviewee selected Spider-Man because he was [...] "beset by woes, money problems, and the question of existence. In short, he is one of us." [...] Following Ditko's departure after issue #38 (July 1966), John Romita, Sr. replaced him as penciler and would draw the series for the next several years. In 1968, Romita would also draw the character's extra-length stories in the comics magazine The Spectacular Spider-Man, a proto-graphic novel designed to appeal to older readers. It only lasted for two issues, but it represented the first Spider-Man spin-off publication, aside from the original series' summer annuals that began in 1964.|$|E

500|$|Madonna had {{promoted}} the album throughout 1983–84 by performing {{a series of}} [...] "track dates", one-off gigs.

It was Madonna's first concert tour and visited North American dates. The Virgin Tour received mixed reception from critics, but was a commercial success. As soon as the tour was announced, tickets were sold out everywhere. Macy's New York department store was flooded with buyers, who bought the tour merchandise like the crucifix earrings and fingerless gloves. After its end, the Virgin Tour was reported to have grossed over $5million ($million in [...] dollars), with Billboard Boxscore reporting a gross of $3.3million ($million in [...] dollars). The tour was recorded and released in VHS, as [...] Later authors have looked back at the tour and commented that it was clear that [...] " [...] was a bonafide pop star in the process of <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> icon." [...] Shari Benstock and Suzanne Ferriss noted the clothes and fashion in the tour and said, [...] "Virgin Tour established Madonna as the hottest figure in pop music." ...|$|E
