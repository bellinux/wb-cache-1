5|$|The true {{impact of}} Operation Mincemeat is unknown, {{although}} {{the island was}} liberated more quickly than anticipated and losses were lower than predicted. The events were depicted in Operation Heartbreak, a 1950 novel by the former cabinet minister Duff Cooper, <b>before</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the agents who planned and carried out Mincemeat, Ewen Montagu, wrote a history in 1953.

5|$|The Ipswich Town Player of the Year {{award is}} voted for {{annually}} by Ipswich Town's supporters {{in recognition of}} the best overall performance by an individual player throughout the football season. Towards the end of each season, fans are invited to cast their votes for this award. They do this by submitting a paper slip to the club's Portman Road offices, with the winner being the player who polls the most votes. The recipient is awarded a rosebowl trophy, presented on the pitch <b>before</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the last home games of the season.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1961, {{differences}} in monetary policy led to open conflict with Bank of Canada Governor Coyne, who adhered to a tight money policy. Appointed by St. Laurent to a term expiring in December 1961, Coyne {{could only be}} dismissed before then by the passing of an Act of Parliament. Coyne defended his position by giving public speeches, {{to the dismay of}} the government. The Cabinet was also angered when it learned that Coyne and his board had passed amendments to the bank's pension scheme which greatly increased Coyne's pension, without publishing the amendments in the Canada Gazette as required by law. Negotiations between Minister of Finance Fleming and Coyne for the latter's resignation broke down, with the governor making the dispute public, and Diefenbaker sought to dismiss Coyne by legislation. Diefenbaker was able to get legislation to dismiss Coyne through the House, but the Liberal-controlled Senate invited Coyne to testify <b>before</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its committees. After giving the governor a platform against the government, the committee then chose to take no further action, adding its view that Coyne had done nothing wrong. Once he had the opportunity to testify (denied him in the Commons), Coyne resigned, keeping his increased pension, and the government was extensively criticized in the press.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland next faced San Francisco at home, winning 37–14 <b>before</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the biggest}} crowds of the season. Chet Adams opened the scoring for the Browns with a 44-yard field goal; he and Lou Saban shared kicking duties {{in the game}} after Groza pulled his leg muscle during pre-game warmups. On the ensuing possession, Albert had the ball {{stripped}} by Cleveland's Weldon Humble, and the Browns took over and scored their first touchdown on a Graham pass to Lavelli. San Francisco scored a touchdown {{near the beginning of}} the second quarter, but Cleveland dominated the scoring thereafter. Lavelli caught seven passes for a total of three touchdowns, setting an AAFC single-game record. Graham also rushed for a one-yard touchdown and threw for 222 yards. His touchdown passes made him the league leader in that category, with 18 on the season. It was the biggest margin of victory the Browns had ever recorded against the 49ers. Cleveland was helped by an adjustment Paul Brown made in his receivers' routes; the coach had Lavelli and Speedie run toward {{the middle of the field}} instead of trying to get open near the sidelines, as they had done in past games. The victory clinched the AAFC's western division for the Browns and assured the team a spot in the championship game.|$|E
5|$|Lap 18 {{saw more}} drivers making {{the change to}} slick tyres, {{including}} Räikkönen and Palmer, but the latter was let go from his pitbox <b>before</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the tyres was properly fitted, costing him time and handing him a ten-second stop-and-go penalty. Both Mercedes drivers and Verstappen made their second pitstops by lap 20, with the order remaining the same. On lap 21, Ricciardo moved ahead of Pérez into fourth position. A mistake by Räikkönen two laps later saw him lose sixth place to Sainz. Fernando Alonso spun on lap 25, but was able to continue, unlike Rio Haryanto, who retired following a spin one lap later. Hamilton retained the lead, but not without problems, as {{he also had a}} short excursion off the track, which was mirrored by Verstappen behind him. As a result, the top three moved closer together. Vettel was still running at the back end of the point-scoring positions, overtaking Kvyat for ninth on lap 29.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} <b>before,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the most}} notable synesthetes is Solomon Shereshevsky, a newspaper reporter turned celebrated mnemonist, who was discovered by Russian neuropsychologist, Alexander Luria, to have a rare fivefold form of synesthesia. Words and text were not only associated with highly vivid visuo-spatial imagery but also sound, taste, color, and sensation. Shereshevsky could recount endless details of many things without form, from lists of names to decades-old conversations, but he had great difficulty grasping abstract concepts. The automatic, and nearly permanent, retention of every little detail due to synesthesia greatly inhibited Shereshevsky from understanding {{much of what he}} read or heard.|$|E
25|$|In 1914 the Fort de Loncin {{was one of}} {{the last}} Liège forts to suffer German bombardment. Liège first came under attack on 6 August 1914.

The {{explosion}} destroyed the heart of the fort, killing 350 of the 550-man garrison, their bodies remaining under the wreckage. Loncin was the only fort at Liège that did not surrender. Many of the dead remain in the fort and the site is considered a war grave as well as a museum.|$|E

25|$|Abnormal {{expression}} of sulfatide {{is linked to}} several neurological disorders. As stated <b>before,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the major neurological disorders is Metachromatic Leukodystrophy, which is caused by elevated levels of sulfatide, leading to the progressive loss of myelin {{as a result of}} sulfatide accumulation. High levels of sulfatide in the gray matter in the cerebellum and in the superior frontal lobe have been associated with Parkinson's disease. Additionally, accumulation of sulfatide in neurons causes audiogenic seizures, which {{have been shown to be}} lethal in mouse models. On the other hand, reduced levels of sulfatide in the cerebral gray and white matter have been associated with Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

Invariably, the third time the father lies in wait, trying to discover the identity of their benefactor. In one version the father confronts the saint, only to have Nicholas say it is not him he should thank, but God alone. In another version, Nicholas learns of the poor man's plan and drops the third bag down the chimney instead; a variant holds that the daughter had washed her stockings that evening and hung them over the embers to dry, and that the bag of gold fell into the stocking.|$|E
25|$|Dan Patch's next notable {{achievement}} was on August 19 at Brighton Beach, where {{he broke the}} world record by pacing a mile in 1:59 despite cold and windy conditions. This {{was the first time}} the race format had used galloping Thoroughbreds to prompt the pace, with one running beside Dan Patch at the start and the other behind. The effort was nearly derailed when Dan Patch came close to clipping the rail when moving into the first turn, while his running mates swept wide and were left behind. Dan Patch completed the half-mile in :59 <b>before</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the pacemakers caught up, then moved in front. His time for the three-quarters was 1:29, just off of world record pace. McHenry urged Dan Patch hard down the homestretch and he responded with a final quarter mile in under 30 seconds to set the record.|$|E

25|$|The Jefferson-Wayles {{descendants}} {{and most}} historians denied for nearly 200 {{years that he}} was the father of Hemings' children. Since the mid-20th century, there have been challenges to that denial, as historians have re-examined some of the evidence and thought to interpret it differently. Disagreements have arisen since the late 20th century over how to interpret historical evidence related to the issue. According to an 1868 letter by Jefferson biographer Henry Randall to the historian James Parton, Jefferson's grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, said that Jefferson's surviving daughter Martha stated on her deathbed that Jefferson had been away from Monticello for 15 months <b>before</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Hemings' children was born, so could not be the father. But historian Dumas Malone later documented that Jefferson had been at Monticello nine months before the birth of each of Hemings' children.|$|E
25|$|High Peak Junction lies at {{the bottom}} of the steep Sheep Pasture incline (some 1320 yards in length at a {{gradient}} varying between 1:8 and 1:9), and following a runaway in 1888 a catch pit was constructed, the two lines passing either side of it. In this accident (of which there are a number of varying versions), it would seem that a wagon loaded with lime and a brake van containing gunpowder broke free from a train, hurtling down the incline at speeds of up to 120mph. Failing to take the bend at the bottom, they then ran across the site, jumping across both the canal (damaging the bank) and the double tracks of the Midland Railway <b>before</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the canisters exploded in the adjacent field. Minutes later the London passenger train passed. Wreckage seen in the catch pit today dates from a further runaway in the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of Hversu Noregr byggdist, where he is only a name in a list, three elements are common {{to all of the}} accounts: {{he was the son of}} a Danish king Healfdene, the brother of Halga, and he was the uncle of Hroðulf. Apart from that, the Scandinavian tradition is unanimous in dwelling on the incestuous relationship between Halga and his daughter Yrsa which resulted in Hroðulf, a story which was either not presented in Beowulf or was not known to the poet. The Danish sources (Chronicon Lethrense, Annales Lundenses, Gesta Danorum) all agree with Beowulf by making Hrothgar the king of Denmark. The Icelandic (Skjöldunga saga, Bjarkarímur, Hrólf Kraki's saga) all agree with Beowulf by mentioning that they had a sister, and by mentioning their feud with Froda and Ingeld, albeit with alterations. What is unique to the Icelandic versions are the adventures of Hrothgar and Halga <b>before</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the two brothers could become king.|$|E
