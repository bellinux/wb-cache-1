5|$|Under U.S. Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA) {{a series}} of bases had {{gradually}} been built in Australia, initially to support the US forces in the Philippines. Seven base sections were established in Australia to operate under USAFIA: <b>Base</b> <b>Section</b> 1 at Birdum, Northern Territory; <b>Base</b> <b>Section</b> 2 in Townsville; <b>Base</b> <b>Section</b> 3 in Brisbane; <b>Base</b> <b>Section</b> 4 in Melbourne; <b>Base</b> <b>Section</b> 5 in Adelaide; <b>Base</b> <b>Section</b> 6 in Perth; and <b>Base</b> <b>Section</b> 7 in Sydney.

5|$|Casey had {{intended}} to come ashore {{on the first day}} of the landing at Lingayen Gulf in January 1945 but was delayed a day because the destroyer he was traveling on had to escort a crippled transport. Despite enormous difficulties ASCOM was able to finish numerous projects on time and some ahead of schedule. On 13 February 1945, ASCOM was transferred to USASOS and redesignated the Luzon <b>Base</b> <b>Section</b> (LUBSEC). Casey then resumed his old post, now renamed Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific. For his services as commander of ASCOM, he was awarded the Legion of Merit. He was subsequently awarded a bronze oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal for his services as Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific.|$|E
5|$|On 16 August 1950 {{the brigade}} was first {{designated}} as the 20th Engineer Brigade and activated at Camp Leonard Wood, Missouri. It deployed overseas to France in November 1952 and established headquarters in Croix Chapeau. Comprising two battalions and six separate companies, the brigade provided engineer construction support to the <b>Base</b> <b>Section</b> of the European COMMZ in southwestern France. In August 1954, it redeployed back to the United States and was activated at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on 10 September 1954. From that time until its inactivation on 12 December 1958, the brigade provided engineer support to the XVIII Airborne Corps.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the unique}} {{structures}} of Igbo culture was the Nsude Pyramids, at the Nigerian town of Nsude, northern Igboland. Ten pyramidal structures were built of clay/mud. The first <b>base</b> <b>section</b> was 60ft. in circumference and 3ft. in height. The next stack was 45ft. in circumference. Circular stacks continued, till it reached the top. The structures were temples for the god Ala/Uto, who was believed to reside at the top. A stick was placed at the top to represent the god's residence. The structures were laid in groups of five parallel to each other. Because it was built of clay/mud like the Deffufa of Nubia, time has taken its toll requiring periodic reconstruction.|$|E

25|$|On Saturday 24 January 1942, Military {{authorities}} visited Somerville House {{with a view}} {{to taking}} it over. The school was officially commandeered by the Australian Military Forces on 1 February, and was later used as <b>Base</b> <b>Section</b> Three Headquarters of the United States Army, East Asian Command, {{for the duration of the}} Second World War. Pupils from north of the Brisbane River were transferred to Raymont Lodge, at Auchenflower, while those from the south went to the former Queen Alexandra Home, Coorparoo; boarding students were sent to Moiomindah at Stanthorpe, which became the school's administrative centre. Based at Stanthorpe, the Principal at the time, Elinor Frances Craig, managed the three dispersed centres and frequently commuted by rail to maintain a presence in Brisbane. The school returned to South Brisbane with minimal inconvenience in January 1945, and classes commenced on 6 February. The American forces still occupied the upper floor of the school's education block with an armed guard at the door.|$|E
500|$|As the Allied forces advanced, new bases were formed, and the {{old ones}} in Australia were closed. Base Sections 5 and 6 were closed in January 1943, and <b>Base</b> <b>Section</b> 4 in June 1944. The {{remaining}} four became bases, and a <b>Base</b> <b>Section</b> was formed in Brisbane to control them. Bases 1 and 3 were closed in December 1944, leaving only Bases 2 and 7. These were deactivated in June 1945 and their functions absorbed by the Australia <b>Base</b> <b>Section,</b> as the <b>Base</b> <b>Section</b> had been renamed in February 1945. In New Guinea, Base D was closed in July 1945, and Bases A, B and E in September, leaving Bases F, G and H. Meanwhile, a series of bases were opened in the Philippines: Base K on Leyte, Base M on Luzon, Base R at Batangas, Base S on Cebu and base X at Manila. These came under the Luzon <b>Base</b> <b>Section,</b> which was redesignated the Philippine on 1 April 1945.

The <b>base</b> <b>section</b> is different from the other seven tower pieces because it supports the rest of the tower.
