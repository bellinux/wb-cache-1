40|$|If unique hues {{have special}} status in phenomenological {{experience}} as perceptually pure, {{it seems reasonable}} to assume that they are represented more precisely by the visual system than are other colors. Following the method of Malkoc et al. (J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 22, 2154 [2005]), we gathered unique and <b>binary</b> <b>hue</b> selections from 50 subjects. For these subjects we repeated the measurements in two separate sessions, allowing us to measure test-retest reliabilities (0. 52 ≤ρ≤ 0. 78; p≪ 0. 01). We quantified the within-individual variability for selections of each hue. Adjusting for the differences in variability intrinsic to different regions of chromaticity space, we compared the within-individual variability for unique hues to that for binary hues. Surprisingly, we found that selections of unique hues did not show consistently lower variability than selections of binary hues. We repeated hue measurements in a single session for an independent sample of 58 subjects, using a different relative scaling of the cardinal axes of MacLeod-Boynton chromaticity space. Again, we found no consistent difference in adjusted within-individual variability for selections of unique and binary hues. Our finding does not depend on the particular scaling chosen for the Y axis of MacLeod-Boynton chromaticity space...|$|E
40|$|Standard {{techniques}} for segmenting color images {{are based on}} finding normalized RGB discontinuities, color histo-gramming, or clustering techniques in RGB or CIE color spaces. The use of the psychophysical variable hue in HSI space has not been popular due to its numerical instability at low saturations. In this article, we propose {{the use of a}} simplified hue description suitable for implementation in analog VLSI. We demonstrate that if the inte-grated white condition holds, hue is invariant to certain types of highlights, shading, and shadows. This is due to the additive/shift invariance property, a property that other color variables lack. The more restrictive uniformly varying lighting model associated with the multiplicative/scale invariance property shared by both hue and normal-ized RGB allows invariance to transparencies, and to simple models of shading and shadows. Using <b>binary</b> <b>hue</b> discontinuities in conjunction with first-order type of surface interpolation, we demonstrate these invariant proper-ties and compare them against the performance of RGB, normalized RGB, and CIE color spaces. We argue that working in HSI space offers an effective method for segmenting scenes in the presence of confounding cues due to shading, transparency, highlights, and shadows. Based on this work, we designed and fabricated for the first time an analog CMOS VLSI circuit with on-board phototransistor input that computes normalized color and hue. ...|$|E
40|$|Malkoç, Gökhan (Dogus Author) We used hue {{cancellation}} and focal naming {{to compare}} {{individual differences in}} stimuli selected for unique hues (e. g., pure blue or green) and <b>binary</b> <b>hues</b> (e. g., blue-green). Standard models assume that <b>binary</b> <b>hues</b> depend on the component responses of red-green and blue-yellow processes. However, variance was comparable for unique and <b>binary</b> <b>hues,</b> and settings across categories showed little correlation. Thus, the choices for the binary mixtures are poorly predicted by the unique hue settings. Hue scaling {{was used to compare}} individual differences both within and between categories. Ratings for distant stimuli were again independent, while neighboring stimuli covaried and revealed clusters near the poles of the LvsM and SvsLM cardinal axes. While individual differences were large, mean focal choices for red, blue-green, yellow-green, and (to a lesser extent) purple fall near the cardinal axes, such that the cardinal axes roughly delineate the boundaries for blue vs. green and yellow vs. green categories. This suggests a weak tie between the cone-opponent axes and the structure of color appearance...|$|R

40|$|The {{spectral}} {{sensitivity of the}} visual system varies markedly between the fovea and surrounding periphery owing {{in part to the}} rapid fall in macular pigment density with eccentricity. We examined how colour appearance changes between the fovea and near periphery (8 °) by measuring achromatic loci and the loci of unique and <b>binary</b> <b>hues.</b> Chosen colours remained much more similar at the two locations than predicted by the change in {{spectral sensitivity}}. Compensation for white may reflect long-term gain changes within the cones that equate sensitivity for the local average stimulus in the fovea and periphery. However, adjusting only to the average stimulus cannot correct for all of the effects of a spectral sensitivity change, and predicts differences in colour percepts between the fovea and periphery that were not observed. The similarities in hue percepts at 0 and 8 ° thus suggest that additional processes help compensate colour appearance to maintain constancy in the near periphery. We model the results of previous studies to show that similar adjustments are implied by age-related changes in lens pigment, and to show that these adjustments are consistent with previous measurements of peripheral colour appearance based on hue cancellation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor {{aperture}} color 3 s stimuli, the four unique hues, {{and at times}} the four (equally-balanced) <b>binary</b> <b>hues,</b> were measured for: (1) adapting white color temperatures 2850, 3400, 5500, 6500 K; and (2) luminance (L) for 5 and 6 log L ranges (about 0. 01 – 3200 cd/m 2) in 3. 2 : 1 L steps (viewed singly) for 1 subject per white, 3 log L in 10 : 1 steps for 6 subjects for white 6500 K, and 1 log L for 2 – 11 subjects per white. The full hue cycle is graphed to the extended wavelength scale. With higher L, unique hues *b and *y shift longer, *g and *r shorter, and spectral binaries and 460 nm are invariant wavelengths, for Ls viewed singly. But for Ls viewed in successive contrast (Bezold–Brucke effect), unique hues are practically invariants. As interstimuli interval increases from 0 – 40 s (from successive L contrast to no-contrast), invariants shift away from uniques (which become hue-shift maxima) and coincide with spectral binaries (but not r/b, 565 c) at 495, 546, 600 nm. Successive L contrast switches spectral uniques’ hue-shift off (as invariants), and spectral binaries on (as hue-shift maxima); and no-contrast switches the reverse. With higher illuminant color temperature 2850 – 6500 K, wavelength of 10 constant hues shortens 5 – 10 nm for *b, *y, g/y, y/r, but others are constant ± 2 nm...|$|R
40|$|Variations in colour {{perception}} have featured prominently in recent attempts {{to argue against}} the view that colours are objective mind-independent properties of the perceptual environment: either physical properties, such as types of surface reflectance profile (e. g. Byrne and Hilbert 1997, 2003, 2007 and Tye 2006), or else sui generis mind-independent properties (e. g. Campbell 1993). My aim in {{this paper is to}} defend the view that colours are mind-independent properties in response to worries arising from one type of empirically documented case of perceptual variation: variation in the perception of the «unique hues». § 1 sets out the challenge raised by variation in the perception of the unique hues. I argue in § 2 that the empirical findings are less dramatic than they might initially appear, and in § 3 that accounting for the inter-personal differences is consistent with the view that colours are mind-independent properties that normal subjects veridically perceive, at least roughly speaking. 1. The Location Problem Unique hues are «pure » instances of the hues red, green, yellow and blue: instances that {{do not appear to be}} a «perceptual mixture » or «phenomenally composed » of any other hues. Unique hues contrast in this respect with <b>binary</b> <b>hues,</b> every instance of which appears to be a perceptual mixture of two other hues: orange, for instance, appears to be phenomenally composed of red and yellow, purple appears to be phenomenally composed of red and blue...|$|R
