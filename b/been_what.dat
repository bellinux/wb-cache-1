5|$|This species {{appears to}} have been confounded with C.distans; and from Lightfoot's {{description}} of the green angles of the fruit, I presume it to have <b>been</b> <b>what</b> he intended under that name. It is considerably larger than the real distans, the spikes black intermixed with green rather than yellowish, and the female ones often branched or compounded at their base. Its most essential and decisive character however consists in the two strong deep-green nerves or ribs which run along each side of the fruit externally near the edge. The arillus is also broader and more compressed than in C.distans.|$|E
5|$|The successors and {{offspring}} of Ramesses III constructed tombs that had straight axes. They all had similar decorations. Notable amongst these is KV2, {{the tomb of}} Ramesses IV, which has been open since antiquity, containing {{a large amount of}} hieratic graffiti. The tomb is mostly intact and is decorated with scenes from several religious texts. The joint tomb of Ramesses V and Ramesses VI, KV9 (also known as the Tomb of Memnon or La Tombe de la Métempsychose) is decorated with many sunk-relief carvings, depicting illustrated scenes from religious texts. Open since antiquity, it contains over a thousand examples of graffiti written in ancient Greek, Latin and Coptic. The spoil from the excavation and later clearance of this tomb, together with later construction of workers huts, covered the earlier burial of KV62 and seems to have <b>been</b> <b>what</b> protected that tomb from earlier discovery and looting.|$|E

Fallas is also worried about the prevalence of sexual tourism in Costa Rica, citing the number of internet sites that promote the practice. As vice-president, Fallas claims that he will consider state spending and the implementation of responsible taxes as economic changes. Fallas says he is sensitive to the middle class, workforce development, and social programs.|$|E

25|$|Cicero’s {{case was}} divided into three parts. The first part {{detailed}} exactly the charge brought by Ericius. Cicero explained how a rustic son of a farmer, who lives off the pleasures of his own land, would not have gained anything from committing patricide because he would have eventually inherited his father's land anyway. The second part concerned the boldness and greed {{of two of the}} accusers, Magnus and Capito. Cicero told the jury that they were the more likely perpetrators of murder because the two were greedy, both for conspiring together against a fellow kinsman and, in particular, Magnus, for his boldness and for being unashamed to appear in court to support the false charges. The third part explained that Chrysogonus had immense political power, and the accusation was successfully made due to that power. Even though Chrysogonus may not have <b>been</b> <b>what</b> Cicero said he was, through rhetoric Cicero successfully made him appear to be a foreign freed man who prospered by devious means {{in the aftermath of the}} civil war. Cicero surmised that it showed what kind of a person he was and that something like murder was not beneath him.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary plans {{showed an}} {{intention}} {{to create a}} square fortification with four angular, [...] "arrow-head" [...] bastions with protective orillons, with living quarters arranged around a square courtyard for the garrison in the centre. It was intended to develop the Italianate ideas first introduced in Portsmouth and Yarmouth under Henry, and would have <b>been</b> <b>what</b> the historian Andrew Saunders considers to be [...] "the most advanced piece of military engineering for its date {{to be seen in}} this country". In 1554, two light artillery guns called sakers were reported installed in the fort. During the reign of Mary I, an unsuccessful attempt was made to create a garrison of 150 men on the island in 1554, partially to provide manpower to complete the project, and in 1591 proposals were again put forward to complete the work.|$|E

500|$|Virginia's {{condition}} {{might have}} <b>been</b> <b>what</b> prompted the Poe family to move, {{in the hopes}} of finding a healthier environment for her. They moved several times within Philadelphia in the early 1840s and their last home in that city is now preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site in Spring Garden. In this home, Virginia was well enough to tend the flower garden and entertain visitors by playing the harp or the piano and singing. The family then moved to New York sometime in early April 1844, traveling by train and steamboat. Virginia waited on board the ship while her husband secured space at a boarding house on Greenwich Street. By early 1846, family friend Elizabeth Oakes Smith said that Virginia admitted, [...] "I know I shall die soon; I know I can't get well; but I want to be as happy as possible, and make Edgar happy."

500|$|In Nappalli, the {{appellant}} {{was dismissed}} from an educational institution for {{his refusal to}} participate in the aforementioned acts. Central to his claim was the submission that these acts were religious practices that went against his belief as a Jehovah's Witness and thus infringed his constitutional right to practice and profess his religion guaranteed by Article 15. However, the Court held that since [...] "religion" [...] in Singapore under the Constitution is restricted to [...] "a citizen's faith in a personal God" [...] and does not include [...] "a system of belief in one's own country", the acts in question were not religious practices. Hence, the appellant's rights had not been contravened. The Court took the view that [...] "the appellant's interpretation of the pledge and anthem ceremony as a religious ceremony was a distortion of secular fact into religious belief". If the appellant's interpretation was correct, this would result in Article 15(1) losing operative effect, for [...] "ow can the same Constitution guarantee religious freedom if, by asking citizens to pledge their allegiance to country, it is (as the appellant suggests) coercing participation in a religious ceremony?

500|$|Aspects of Nelson's {{life and}} career were controversial, both during his {{lifetime}} and after his death. His affair with Emma Hamilton was widely remarked upon and disapproved of, {{to the extent that}} Emma was denied permission to attend Nelson's funeral and was subsequently ignored by the government, which awarded money and titles to Nelson's legitimate family. Nelson's actions during the reoccupation of Naples have also been the subject of debate: his approval of the wave of reprisals against the Jacobins who had surrendered under the terms agreed by Cardinal Ruffo, and his personal intervention in securing the execution of Caracciolo, are considered by some biographers, such as Robert Southey, to have been a shameful breach of honour. Prominent contemporary politician Charles James Fox was among those who attacked Nelson for his actions at Naples, declaring in the House of Commons I wish that the atrocities of which we hear so much and which I abhor as much as any man, were indeed unexampled. I fear that they do not belong exclusively to the French– Naples for instance has <b>been</b> <b>what</b> is called [...] "delivered", and yet, if I am rightly informed, it has been stained and polluted by murders so ferocious, and by cruelties of every kind so abhorrent, that the heart shudders at the recital... demanded that a British officer should be brought forward, and to him they capitulated. They made terms with him under the sanction of the British name. Before they sailed their property was confiscated, numbers were thrown into dungeons, and some of them, I understand, notwithstanding the British guarantee, were actually executed. Other pro-republican writers produced books and pamphlets decrying the events in Naples as atrocities. Later assessments, including one by Andrew Lambert, have stressed that the armistice had not been authorised by the King of Naples, and that the retribution meted out by the Neapolitans was not unusual for the time. Lambert also suggests that Nelson in fact acted {{to put an end to}} the bloodshed, using his ships and men to restore order in the city.|$|E
500|$|James the Fat led {{the men of}} Lennox and Argyll in open {{rebellion}} against the crown and this may have <b>been</b> <b>what</b> the king needed to bring a charge of treason against the Albany Stewarts. Murdoch, his sons Walter and Alexander and Duncan, Earl of Lennox were in Stirling Castle for their trial on 18 May at a specially convened parliament. An assize of seven earls and fourteen lesser nobles were appointed {{to hear the evidence}} that linked the prisoners to the rebellion in the Lennox. [...] The four men were condemned, Walter on 24 May and the others on 25 May and immediately beheaded in 'front of the castle'. James demonstrated a ruthless and avaricious side to his nature in the destruction of his close family, the Albany Stewarts, that yielded the three forfeited earldoms of Fife, Menteith and Lennox. An enquiry set up by James in 1424 into the dispersal of crown estates since the reign of Robert I exposed legal defects in a number of transactions where the earldoms of Mar, March and Strathearn together with the Black Douglas lordships of Selkirk and Wigtown were found to be problematic. [...] Strathearn and March were forfeited in 1427 and 1435 respectively. Mar was forfeited in 1435 on the earl's death without heir which also meant that the lordships of Garioch and Badenoch reverted to the crown. James sought to boost his income further through taxation and succeeded in getting parliament to pass legislation in 1424 for a tax to go towards paying off the ransom—£26,000 was raised but James sent only £12,000 to England. By 1429, James stopped the ransom payments completely and used the remainder of the taxation on buying cannons and luxury goods from Flanders. Following a fire in the castle of Linlithgow in 1425, funds were also diverted to the building of Linlithgow Palace which continued until James's death in 1437 and absorbed an estimated one tenth of royal income.|$|E
