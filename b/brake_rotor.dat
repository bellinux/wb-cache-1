50|$|First time {{an entirely}} new car was {{designed}} and fabricated from scratch at Rutgers in a school year. The car earned a spot in design semi finals. Utilized a 600CC Honda F3 motor.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesTwo magnesium/silicon {{aluminium}} alloys each reinforced with 20 vol. % SiC particulates have been worn against three different automobile friction linings (brake pads). Two of the friction linings {{are commonly used}} against cast iron <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> while the third has been formulated for use against aluminium MMC <b>brake</b> <b>rotors.</b> Wear processes at the interfaces of the specific rotor - pad combinations have been characterised through the analysis of friction traces {{and the use of}} optical and electron microscopy. Models on the interdependence of friction and wear, and models of wear mechanisms for aluminium MMCs and cast iron sliding against friction materials have been proposed and discussed. For an aluminium MMC sliding against an organic pad formulated for use against cast iron, wear rates are low and friction is constant due to the formation of a solid lubricant layer at the wear interface. When this MMC is worn against a semi-metallic pad formulated for use against cast iron, wear rates are extremely high due to two and three body abrasion which lead to subsurface delamination and early melt wear in the MMC. For an aluminium MMC developed for its use in automobile <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> sliding against a semi-metallic pad specifically formulated for its use against MMC <b>brake</b> <b>rotors,</b> wear rates at low loads are low although friction traces are irregular and fracture of the SiC particulates occurs at the lowest load and sliding velocity. This fracture of SiC is caused by the abrasive action of hard alumina particles within the pad. At high loads and sliding velocities cohesiveness of materials within the pad is poor and the wear rate of the MMC is extremely high. At the highest load/sliding velocity combination, the wear resistance of the MMC is inferior to that of its unreinforced matrix. If the structure and composition of friction linings are arranged correctly, the wear resistance and frictional performance of aluminium MMC <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> are superior to those of cast iron <b>brake</b> <b>rotors.</b> In addition, the lower density of aluminium MMCs provides for an economic advantage over cast iron with respect to efficient use of fuel, and fabrication expenses...|$|R

50|$|The Alfine 500 group, first {{introduced}} at Eurobike in 2006, included the epicyclic hub gear SG-S500.

These mechanisms are grease-lubricated.|$|E
50|$|Ideally, {{the nuts}} (or bolts) should be {{tightened}} with a torque wrench. Lug wrenches {{are much less}} expensive because they lack the ability to measure or limit the force used. Installing a wheel with a lug wrench thus requires a bit of rough guessing about proper tightness. Excessive force can strip threads or make the nuts very difficult to remove. Also, uneven torque between the various lug nuts, or excessive torque, can lead to warping of the <b>brake</b> <b>rotor</b> if the car is equipped with disc brakes. For this reason, impact wrenches should properly be used only for removing lug nuts, not for tightening them, although in practice this rule is often ignored for convenience's sake, even by professional mechanics.|$|E

40|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>rotors</b> play a {{significant}} role in converting the vehicle kinetic energy into heat energy that is dissipated through conduction and convection. The automotive industry has been looking for many years to develop lightweight <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> to reduce vehicle weight and subsequently improve fuel efficiency and vehicle emissions targets. Uncoated wrought aluminium alloys and metal matrix composite (Al-MMC) rotors have been reported to have insufficient safety margin for most passenger car applications. In this study, the thermal performance of coated and uncoated lightweight aluminium disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> was investigated numerically and experimentally, using both small scale and full size brake dynamometers. Five small scale solid <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> were investigated: grey cast iron, forged aluminium alloy (6082), the same 6082 alloy but with an alumina surface layer applied by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO), cast aluminium MMC (AMC 640 XA), and the same MMC again with PEO alumina surface layer. The disc and pad temperatures, brake pressure, coefficient of friction and brake torque were monitored during the tests for each disc brake material. In addition, a two dimensional axisymmetric finite element model was developed using Abaqus software in order to investigate the temperature distribution through the disc. The 2 D FE model demonstrated good overall agreement with the experimental results and showed the same general trends. It was found that the PEO coated aluminium alloy has the best overall performance of the lightweight rotors tested in terms of friction and structural integrity at elevated temperature...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Traditionally, {{automotive}} <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> {{are made}} with cast iron. Besides having economical advantage, cast iron rotor provides many disadvantages due to its weight, such as reduction in fuel efficiency, increase in green house gas emission, and increase in noise, vibration and hardness. With the development of commercial aluminum composites, composite <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> are now manufactured. However, the present commercial composite materials are not specifically made for brake application and there are drawbacks. A major drawback is their poor elevated temperature property. In this paper, the unique properties offered by an aluminum composite for brake application is addressed, and an approach to compensate its properties for brake application is highlighted...|$|R
