40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{relationship}} between the effective capacity (stability limit) of unidirectional and bidirectional packet-switched wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) ring networks for multicast traffic. We consider both bidirectional rings with one packet copy transmission per wave-length channel and two packet copy transmissions. We first prove bounds for the ratio of the multicast capacity of the <b>bidirectional</b> <b>ring</b> to the multicast capacity of the unidirectional ring. Specifically, we show that this ratio is at least two for two copy transmission in the <b>bidirectional</b> <b>ring,</b> and at most two for one copy transmission. We derive closed form expressions of the multicast capacity ratios for networks with a large number of nodes and from these expressions show that the ratios tend to two for a large number of multicast destinations. We demonstrate that for the <b>bidirectional</b> <b>ring</b> with two copy transmission the ratio becomes as large as 2. 276. We also find that in the <b>bidirectional</b> <b>ring,</b> the capacity gain with two copy transmission over one copy transmission reaches 30. 4 %.

40|$|The online packet routing {{problem is}} {{studied in the}} context of moving data packets {{efficiently}} among network nodes. This problem is a special case of the more general k − k routing problem where it is assumed that all packets are known to an algorithm before any packet is sent and each node sends and receives exactly k packets. The online version relaxes these constraints and allows for packets to have arbitary release times and for any number of packets to originate at or to be delivered to any node. The goal of an algorithm is to construct a schedule for any instance with small makespan (maximum completion time) relative to the optimal makespan for a worst case instance.

40|$|In a {{reconfigurable}} network, lightpath connections can be dynamically {{changed to}} reflect changes in traffic conditions. This paper characterizes the gain in traffic capacity that a reconfigurable wavelength division multiplezed (WDM) network offers over a fixed topology network where lightpath connections are fixed and cannot be changed. We define the gain as {{the ratio of}} the maximum offered loads that the two systems can support for a given blocking probability. We develop a system model to approximate the blocking probability for both the fixed and reconfigurable systems. This model is different from previous models developed to analyze the blocking probability in WDM networks in that it accounts for a port limitation at the nodes. We validate our model via simulation and find that it agrees strongly with simulation results. We study high-bandwidth calls, where each call requires an entire wavelength and find that reconfigurability offers a substantial performance improvement, particularly when the number of available wavelengths significantly exceeds the number of ports per node. In this case, in a ring with nodes, the gain approaches a factor of 2 over a fixed topology unidirectional ring, and 4 over a fixed topology <b>bidirectional</b> <b>ring.</b> Hence, a reconfigurable unidirectional (<b>bidirectional)</b> <b>ring</b> can support 2 (4) times the load of a fixed topology unidirectional (<b>bidirectional)</b> <b>ring.</b> We also show that for a given traffic load, a configurable system requires far fewer ports per node than a fixed topology system.
