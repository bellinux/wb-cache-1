Within the church, it is seen as a great honor to <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> society and the members believe that the best help lies in the people they are more than in the caring acts they perform.

25|$|Sarajevo is and has {{historically}} {{been one of the}} most important musical enclaves in the region. The Sarajevo school of pop rock developed in the city between 1961 and 1991. This type of music began with bands like Indexi, Pro Arte, and singer-songwriter Kemal Monteno. It continued into the 1980s, with bands such as Plavi Orkestar, Crvena Jabuka, and Divlje Jagode, by most accounts, pioneering the regional rock and roll movement. Sarajevo was also the home and birthplace of arguably the most popular and influential Yugoslav rock band of all time, Bijelo Dugme, somewhat of a Bosnian parallel to the Rolling Stones, in both popularity and influence. Sarajevo was also the home of a very notable post-punk urban subculture known as the New Primitives, which began during the early 1980s with the Baglama Band which was banned shortly after first LP and was brought into the mainstream through bands such as Zabranjeno Pušenje and Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors, as well as the Top Lista Nadrealista radio, and later television show. Other notable bands considered to <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> subculture are Bombaj Štampa. Besides and separately from the New Primitives, Sarajevo is the hometown to one of the most significant ex-Yugoslavian alternative industrial-noise bands, SCH (1983–current).|$|E

500|$|Many {{believers in}} the {{imminent}} approach of Planet X/Nibiru accuse NASA of deliberately covering up visual evidence of its existence.

500|$|Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina on 6October 1908, {{which caused}} the Annexation Crisis in Europe. The Kingdom of Serbia protested and mobilised its army, but then on 31March 1909, it {{formally}} accepted the annexation. In 1911, Mladen Stojanović {{became a member}} of the secret association of students of the Tuzla gymnasium called Narodno Jedinstvo (National Unity); its members described it as a youth society of nationalists. It was one of a group of diverse student organisations later called Young Bosnia, which strongly opposed Austria-Hungary's rule over Bosnia-Herzegovina. The activists of Young Bosnia were Bosnian Serbs, Muslims, and Croats, though most were Serbs. The first organisation regarded to <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> group was established in 1904 by Serb students of the Mostar gymnasium. 1905 saw considerable political unrest among the Serb and Croat students of the Tuzla gymnasium. Although the provincial government imposed the name [...] "Bosnian" [...] on the language of the province (Serbo-Croatian), the students demonstratively termed it as Serbian or Croatian depending on their ethnic affiliation.|$|E

Explaining this, he said, [...] "that's where the best stuff comes from. You've got to break yourself down before you can build something great." [...] While producing the album, Ross Robinson was injured from a dirt bike accident, fracturing his back. He returned to the studio after a day of hospital treatment, reportedly [...] "putting all of his pain into the album", much to the admiration of the band.|$|E
