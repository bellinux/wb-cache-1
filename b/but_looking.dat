5|$|Critics praised System Shock and hailed it {{as a major}} {{breakthrough}} in its genre. It was later placed on multiple hall of fame lists. The game was a moderate commercial success, with sales exceeding 170,000 copies, <b>but</b> <b>Looking</b> Glass ultimately lost money on the project. A sequel, System Shock 2, was released by Looking Glass Studios and offshoot developer Irrational Games in 1999. The 2000 game Deus Ex (also produced by Spector) and the 2007 game BioShock are spiritual successors to the two games. A remade version of the original game by Night Dive Studios is scheduled for release in 2018.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} costs of his lifestyle, Davidson needed more money than his Stiffkey living could provide. He sought to improve his {{financial}} position when, in about 1920, he met Arthur John Gordon, supposedly a wealthy American company promoter but in reality an undischarged bankrupt and confidence trickster. Gordon not only persuaded Davidson to invest his savings {{in a range of}} dubious schemes, but also got him to solicit funds from other investors. Davidson borrowed heavily to increase his investment and by 1925 was in serious financial difficulties. In February that year he failed to pay his local rates and was threatened with imprisonment. He avoided this by borrowing from moneylenders at exorbitant interest rates, but in October was forced to file a petition of bankruptcy with debts totalling £2,924. Eventually a settlement was reached, whereby around half of his Stiffkey stipend was applied to the reduction of his debts. Somehow, however, Davidson managed to continue his London life. He never stopped believing in Gordon's essential honesty, and was certain that one day his investments would pay off. Much of his time in London was spent, not in pursuit of girls, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> for Gordon.|$|E

25|$|It is true {{that the}} first half of the 20th century was full of internecine warfare, {{economic}} depression, ethnic cleansing and racist genocide that killed tens of millions of people, more than any other period in human history. <b>But</b> <b>looking</b> only at the disasters creates an incomplete perception, because the second half of the century witnessed a much more positive development in spite of the Cold War. After the defeat of Fascism in 1945, the peaceful revolution of 1989/90 also liberated the East from Communist control in a quite unexpected fashion. As a result, Europeans generally live more free, prosperous and healthy lives than ever before.|$|E
25|$|The {{exhibition}} {{closed in}} the late 1990s {{and almost all of}} the exhibits were taken away. The locomotive The Queen was too expensive to remove, so, rather than being cut up, it was incorporated as a feature of a restaurant on the concourse. It is still there today, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> a little tired. The tender– the only original (and historic) part of the replica engine– was sold to a scrap dealer and cut up, although the springs and axleboxes were salvaged for use in the replica LB Atlantic project at the Bluebell Railway, and part of one side was rescued by the Slough and Windsor Railway Society, where it is now on display.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the south}} window, the first panel of {{which shows the}} {{archangel}} Michael holding a trumpet, representing the call to battle, and, above his head, a seated woman with children at her knee, symbolising the sacrifices {{of women and children}} in the name of liberty, honour, and justice, while in the lower portion an armoured figure bears the Crown of Victory in his hands. The second panel contains the inscriptions: AT THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN AND IN THE MORNING WE WILL REMEMBER THEM, taken from the work of Laurence Binyon, and FREEDOM IS THE SURE POSSESSION OF THOSE ALONE WHO HAVE COURAGE TO DEFEND IT, from Pericles, as well as, in the lower portion, an armoured figure holding a flambeau, and, in the upper part, St. George slaying the dragon. The third panel contains Lady Justice bearing the Scales of Justice and the Great Sword of Judgement, the sword-guard of which shows a figure in a crucifixion pose—representing suffering for both the victors and the defeated—and below her the words JUSTITIA LIBERTAS PERPETUO (Justice Liberty in Perpetuity). Beneath Lady Justice in this panel is the heroic figure of Canada wearing armour and helmet and holding the laurel wreath of victory, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> mournfully at the Book of Remembrance, and behind her are two other persons, one symbolising Canadian motherhood and the other First Nations. The fourth quadrant shows Joan of Arc bearing a shield and standing before the royal coat of arms of France.|$|E

[...] This request was the same year that prosecutors say he agreed to start paying hush money to the person he allegedly committed misconduct against. John told the New York Times that [...] "I did not think much about it at the time, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> back at it, it does seem strange. He just said he needed to generate some cash." ...|$|E

He grew up in Boca Raton, Florida. [...] He was raised Jewish, and has said: [...] "People are shocked at first that I’m Jewish. I get teased in the clubhouse about being Jewish, but we all get teased about something. Going to Hebrew school and being a bar mitzvah … made my mom really happy. I wished I had been out playing baseball, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> back at it now, I’m happy I did it.” [...] Valencia has a sister, Laura.|$|E
500|$|The seal from 1752 {{is shown}} in Figure 2. The beaver honored Albany's past as an {{important}} fur trading port. Adding {{to the history of}} this seal, one historian states, [...] " [...] displays the beaver, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> in the original, more like a drowned cat than the fat and sleek animal, it was intended to represent. Neither the resolution nor the records state why the change was made." [...] In 1755 the original seal (Figure 1) was reinstated for use by the mayor in licensing businesses. So at this point the city had two seals, one corporate and one public. The earlier seal, however, was last seen in 1761 and the beaver continued as the sole city seal from then on.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Photograph" [...] {{was released on}} 9 May 2015. The video is a montage of real home footage. Sheeran sourced the clips from his father, who was then compiling it into DVDs for their family Christmas present. He initially intended the clips for inclusion in a documentary that was being produced around that time; <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> through the collection, he thought it might work for a music video. Sheeran also admitted he could not attend to an actual video shoot, hence he opted for the montage. Emil Nava, who had previously worked with Sheeran on his other promotional music videos, directed [...] "Photograph". Editor Ellie Johnson worked with Sheeran's father while in central London. According to Johnson, they spent a weekend gathering the clips used in the montage.|$|E

2500|$|On July 1, 2003, Twiztid {{released}} {{their third}} studio album and seventh overall album, The Green Book. Spaniolo {{has referred to}} the album as a [...] "Juggalo favorite". Allmusic reviewer Rob Theakston panned the album, writing that it [...] "is much, {{much better than the}} last ICP card record, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> at the forest from the trees, that really isn't saying much anymore." [...] The Green Book peaked at number 2 on the Top Independent Charts and number 52 on the Billboard 200. Twiztid released their third EP and eighth overall album titled Fright Fest '03 at their Fright Fest 2003 show.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the comedy}} Deewana Mastana, Chawla {{played the role}} of Dr. Neha Sharma, who forms the love {{interest}} of Kapoor and Govinda and ends up marrying Salman Khan. Planet Bollywood wrote [...] "Juhi needs to look gorgeous in the movie, while showing indifference towards the monkeys who are after her. She is impeccable in the acting requirements, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> beautiful is not always easy since working in a David Dhawan movie requires the hero and heroine to wear garishly coloured/designed outfits. However, in the end Juhi probably won over David and in the entire film [...] her attire and looks could both kill". The film was a major commercial success and performed extremely well at the box office.|$|E

Isaac explained that he had done so to save his life. Abimelech complained that one of the people might have lain with her, and Isaac would have brought guilt upon the Philistines, and Abimelech charged the people not to molest Isaac or Rebekah, on pain of death. God blessed Isaac, who reaped bountiful harvests. The second reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|Savige {{rejected}} the plans. His justification {{in the official}} war history provides a fair and reasonable portrait of Potts, as seen from above {{in the chain of}} command: [...] "Potts was a very gallant man and looked for fights, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> without planning the ways and means to land and support troops on hostile shores was another thing. Further, Potts always found it difficult to envisage or accommodate himself to the overall plan of his commander ... Potts was a character apart from the rest. His personal courage was unsurpassed and his genial nature drew one to him. However, his zeal to be on patrol or with the leading section denied him control of operations which led him to countenance fear of some disaster overtaking his troops".|$|E
