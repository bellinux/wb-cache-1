30|$|By {{virtue of}} their altered {{environmental}} fate and risk profile, all systemic pesticides should be counted when measuring pesticide use, and hence so too should the Bt proteins manufactured in Bt- transgenic crops. If Bt-transgenic plants produced proteins that disrupted insect morphology, feeding behavior, or reproduction, {{the absence of a}} toxic mode of action would strengthen the argument that Bt Cry proteins are not functionally equivalent to insecticides, and hence should not be counted as insecticides applied. Bt-crop technology that limits <b>Bt-endotoxin</b> expression to only those tissues that are under active attack, and then only during times when insects are actively feeding, would also support the view that Bt crops are compatible with IPM.|$|E
40|$|The insecticidal {{properties}} of Cry-endotoxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) {{have long been}} used as spore-crystals in commercial spray formulations for insect control. Recently, some <b>Bt-endotoxin</b> genes have been cloned in many different plants. Toxicological evaluations of three spore-crystal endotoxins, BtCry 1 Ia, BtCry 10 Aa and BtCry 1 Ba 6 from B. thuringiensis, were carried out on mice to understand their adverse effects on hematological systems and on genetic material. These three spore-crystals have shown toxic activity to the boll weevil, {{which is one of}} the most aggressive pests of the cotton crop. Cry 1 Ia, Cry 10 Aa and Cry 1 Ba 6 did not increase the micronucleus frequency in the peripheral erythrocytes of mice and did not cause changes in the frequency of polychromatic erythrocytes. However, some hematologic disburbances were observed, specifically related to Cry 1 Ia and Cry 1 Ba 6, respectively, for the erythroid and lymphoid lineage. Thus, although the profile of such adverse side effects can be related to their high level of exposure, which is not commonly found in the environment, results showed that these Bt spore-crystals were not harmless to mice, indicating that each spore-crystal endotoxin presents a characteristic profile of toxicity and might be investigated individually...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{assessment of risk}} to natural enemies from <b>Bt-endotoxins</b> from bioengineered crops must evaluate potential harm, as well as exposure pathways in non-target arthropod food webs. Despite being abundant generalist predators in agricultural fields, spiders (Araneae) have often been overlooked {{in the context of}} Bt crop risk assessment. Spiders and their prey were collected from transgenic corn fields expressing lepidopteran-specific Cry 1 Ab, coleopteran-specific Cry 3 Bb 1, both proteins, and a non-transgenic near isoline. Spiders and prey were screened for Cry 1 Ab and Cry 3 Bb 1 using qualitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Spiders from the three most common functional guilds, wandering sheet-tangle weavers, orb-weavers, and ground runners, tested positive for Cry 1 Ab and Cry 3 Bb 1 proteins, with the highest per cent positive (8. 0 % and 8. 3 %) during and after anthesis. Laboratory feeding trials revealed that <b>Bt-endotoxins</b> were detectable in the Pardosa sp. (Lycosidae) - immature cricket-Bt corn pathway, but not in the Tennesseellum formica (Linyphiidae) -Collembola-Bt corn pathway. Additionally, direct consumption of transgenic corn pollen by Pardosa sp., T. formica, and Cyclosa turbinata (Araneidae) resulted in transfer of both Cry 1 Ab and Cry 3 Bb 1 endotoxins. This study demonstrates that <b>Bt-endotoxins</b> are taken up by diverse members of a spider community via pollen and prey consumption and should be factored into future risk assessment...|$|R
40|$|The use of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) {{endotoxins}} {{to control}} insect vectors of human diseases and agricultural pests {{is threatened by}} the possible evolution of resistance in major pest species. Despite the use of <b>Bt-endotoxins</b> in transgenic crops covering about 80 million hectares, the precise details of how endotoxins bind to gut cells to kill insects are poorly understood. This limitation impedes our understanding of potential mechanisms of insect resistance to <b>Bt-endotoxins</b> other than the loss or modification of receptors. We explored a novel mechanism, where tolerance to <b>Bt-endotoxins</b> is correlated with an elevated immune status involving cell-free immune reactions in the gut lumen. The thesis project is based on investigations of a laboratory culture of the flour moth Ephestia kuehniella, which showed induction of hemolymph melanization a sign of immune induction, after feeding sub-lethal concentrations of a Bt-formulation. Since the elevated immune status was transmitted to subsequent generations by a maternal effect, an increase of toxin in the food by increments was possible every generation. Investigations of strains exposed to various toxin levels revealed a correlation between systemic immune induction and Bt-tolerance. Molecular analysis revealed a possible mechanism of immune mediated inactivation of <b>Bt-endotoxins</b> in the gut lumen. To gain more specific information about the effector pathways involved in the protection against the toxin, we studied the effects of Bt-toxin formulations in susceptible (non-induced) and tolerant (immune-induced) larvae after natural (parasitism-mediated) and chemical (tropolone-mediated) suppression of defence reactions. Although melanization in hemolymph was significantly reduced, {{there was no significant}} effect on susceptibility to the toxin in parasitised or tropolone-treated larvae. This suggests that melanization of hemolymph is correlated with an elevated immune status but not responsible for the observed tolerance to Bt-toxin. This leaves coagulation as a likely mechanism for Bt-tolerance in the gut lumen. To examine whether hemolymph proteins exist in the gut lumen were they could function as pro-coagulants to inactivate the toxin; we compared gut and plasma proteins of immune-induced larvae with those of non-induced larvae. This analysis revealed that the lipid carrier lipophorin represents a major component in the gut lumen and interacts with mature Bt-toxin like an oligomeric lectin that may inactivate the toxin in a cell free coagulation reaction in the gut lumen before it can reach the brush border membrane. Further analysis showed that lipophorin particles are the regulatory and effector components in innate immune defence reactions, which are involved in the recognition and inactivation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and bacteria {{even in the absence of}} hemocytes. Examination of proteins from lipophorin particles separated by low-density gradient centrifugation have shown that in immuneinduced insects sub-populations of lipophorin particles are associated with pattern recognition proteins, phenoloxidase and regulatory proteins that activate prophenoloxidase. Moreover, interactions with lectins resulted in the assembly of lipophorin particles into cage-like coagulation products, effectively protecting the surrounding tissues and cells from the potentially damaging effects of pathogens and phenoloxidase products. This cell-free immune reaction mediated by lipophorin particles may potentially involve in detoxification of poreforming toxins (<b>Bt-endotoxins)</b> in the gut lumen. Thesis (Ph. D.)
