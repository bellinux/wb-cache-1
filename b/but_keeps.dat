The unfortunate officer Stanni, while attempting to demolish a smelly privy, loses his dignity and a large section of trouser fabric to such an incident. The sticky bomb also featured in the British television comedy series Dad's Army.

After going to the bookstore to buy The God Delusion, Brian meets an atheist named Carolyn, {{who happens to be}} looking for the same book. Brian becomes interested in Carolyn, and the two begin to date.

Brian realizes that Stewie is right and decides to listen to his advice. However, he finds out that Carolyn has begun to date Cleveland, since Brian did not want to have sex for the three weeks they have dated, and assumed he just wanted to be friends.

5|$|E.P. Arnold Royalton, {{owner of}} {{conglomerate}} Royalton Industries, offers Speed an astoundingly luxurious lifestyle {{in exchange for}} signing to race with him. Speed is tempted but declines due to his father's distrust of power-hungry corporations. Angered, Royalton reveals that for many years the key races have been fixed by corporate interests, including Royalton himself, to gain profits. Royalton takes out his anger on Speed by having his drivers force Speed into a crash that destroys the Mach 6 and suing Racer Motors for intellectual property infringement. Speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through Inspector Detector, head of a corporate crimes division. Racer Taejo Togokahn {{says that he has}} evidence that could indict Royalton but will only offer it up if Speed and the mysterious masked Racer X agree to race on his team in the Casa Cristo 5000. Taejo says that a win could substantially raise the stock price of his family's racing business, blocking a Royalton-arranged buyout. Speed agrees <b>but</b> <b>keeps</b> his decision secret from his family, and Inspector Detector's team makes several defensive modifications to the Mach 5 to assist Speed in the rally.|$|E
5|$|Much more {{is known}} of the {{hundreds}} of unique cleitean that decorate the archipelago. These dome-shaped structures are constructed of flat boulders with a cap of turf on the top. This enables the wind to pass through the cavities in the wall <b>but</b> <b>keeps</b> the rain out. They were used for storing peat, nets, grain, preserved flesh and eggs, manure, and hay, and as a shelter for lambs in winter. The date of origin of this St Kildan invention is unknown, but they were in continuous use from prehistoric times until the 1930 evacuation. More than 1,200 ruined or intact cleitean remain on Hirta and a further 170 on the neighbouring islands. House no. 16 in the modern village has an early Christian stone cross built into the front wall, which may date from the 7th century.|$|E

25|$|In Reconstruction-era United States, {{sharecropping}} {{was one of}} {{few options}} for penniless freedmen to support themselves and their families. Other solutions included the crop-lien system (where the farmer was extended credit for seed and other supplies by the merchant), a rent labor system (where the former slave rents his land <b>but</b> <b>keeps</b> his entire crop), and the wage system (worker earns a fixed wage, <b>but</b> <b>keeps</b> none of their crop). Sharecropping {{was by far the}} most economically efficient, as it provided incentives for workers to produce a bigger harvest. It was a stage beyond simple hired labor, because the sharecropper had an annual contract. During Reconstruction, the federal Freedmen's Bureau ordered the arrangements and wrote and enforced the contracts.|$|E

25|$|The {{porous pot}} {{version of the}} Daniell cell was invented by John Dancer, a Liverpool {{instrument}} maker, in 1838. It consists of a central zinc anode dipped into a porous earthenware pot containing a zinc sulfate solution.

The use of a porous barrier allows ions to pass through <b>but</b> <b>keeps</b> the solutions from mixing.|$|E
25|$|A {{charitable}} {{view of the}} Japanese {{system of}} divorce is that it favors a ‘clean break’ so that the divorced parties have little or nothing {{more to do with}} each other after the divorce. A less generous interpretation is that it permits the spouse with economic assets (usually the husband) to keep most of his assets, avoid payment of alimony and provide little or no child support, but the price he pays is the abandonment of any relationship with his children, while the other spouse is punished economically, <b>but</b> <b>keeps</b> her children.|$|E
