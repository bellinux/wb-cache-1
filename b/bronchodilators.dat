5|$|Most {{cases of}} COPD can be {{prevented}} by reducing exposure to risk factors. This includes decreasing rates of smoking and improving indoor and outdoor air quality. While treatment can slow worsening, there is no cure. COPD treatments include stopping smoking, vaccinations, respiratory rehabilitation, and often inhaled <b>bronchodilators</b> and steroids. Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation. In those who have periods of acute worsening, increased use of medications and hospitalization may be needed.|$|E

5|$|Asthma, chronic bronchitis, {{bronchiectasis}} {{and chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This limits {{the amount of}} air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as <b>bronchodilators,</b> and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe cases. One common cause of COPD and emphysema is smoking, and common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis. The definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.|$|E
30|$|The <b>bronchodilator</b> {{effects of}} ginger {{essential}} oil were confirmed on airway system. Ginger essential oil with citral, eucalyptol and camphor had relaxing effect on rat's airway and inhibited the carbachol induced rat tracheal contraction.

40|$|Background: Spirometry is a {{physiologic}} {{test that}} measures {{the volume of}} air an individual inhales or exhales and {{the rate at which}} the volume is changed as a function of time. <b>Bronchodilator</b> response, as a beneficial test for diagnosis of bronchial responsiveness is measured using the percent change from baseline and absolute changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second and/or forced vital capacity. In this study we aimed to assess the increase in spirometric parameters in patients with symptoms of asthma regardless of spirometric pattern. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study <b>bronchodilator</b> test was performed in individuals with dyspnea, cough or wheezing and the mean increase in various spirometric parameters was measured and compared among individuals with different spirometric patterns.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{relationship}} between patient-reported symptoms and objective measures of lung function is poorly understood. AIM: To determine {{the association between}} responsiveness to <b>bronchodilator</b> and respiratory symptoms in random population samples. METHODS: 4669 people aged 40 years and older from 8 sites in Canada completed interviewer-administered respiratory questionnaires and performed spirometry before and after administration of 200 ug of inhaled salbutamol. The effect of anthropometric variables, smoking exposure and doctor-diagnosed asthma (DDA) on <b>bronchodilator</b> responsiveness in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) and in forced vital capacity (FVC) were evaluated. Multiple logistic regression {{was used to test}} for association between quintiles of increasing changes in FEV 1 and in FVC after <b>bronchodilator</b> and several respiratory symptoms. RESULTS: Determinants of <b>bronchodilator</b> change in FEV 1 and FVC included age, DDA, smoking, respiratory drug use and female gender [p< 0. 005 to p< 0. 0001]. In subjects without doctor-diagnosed asthma or COPD, <b>bronchodilator</b> response in FEV 1 was associated with wheezing [p for trend< 0. 0001], while <b>bronchodilator</b> response for FVC was associated with breathlessness.

Thus, it was possible to relate histamine sensitivity of the airways (the concentration of histamine, at which forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) falls by 10 % (PC 10)) to the maximal <b>bronchodilator</b> response (Delta FEV 1) and the sensitivity to the <b>bronchodilator</b> (cumulative dose of inhaled terbutaline at which FEV 1 increases by 10 % (RD 10)). Subjects with a bronchoconstrictor response (PC 10 less than or equal to 16 mg. mL(- 1); n= 38) had more respiratory symptoms than those without (n= 63) (40 versus 21 %) and also lower baseline FEV 1 values (90 versus 96 % predicted), but had comparable <b>bronchodilator</b> responsiveness, Subjects with a <b>bronchodilator</b> response (Delta FEV 1 greater than or equal to 9 % of the predicted value; n= 13) did not differ from those without (n= 88) for all parameters, including symptoms, allergy and pulmonary function, In those with a bronchoconstrictor response, there was a weak but significant correlation between the PC 10 and RD 10 (rho= - 0. 32), but not between FC 10 and Delta FEV 1. This study suggests that bronchoconstrictor and <b>bronchodilator</b> responsiveness are not highly correlated, even in subjects with airways obstruction, Symptoms were associated with the presence of a bronchoconstrictor, but not a <b>bronchodilator,</b> response, We conclude that bronchoconstrictor and <b>bronchodilator</b> responsiveness are two different phenotypic markers that are not interchangeable in epidemiological studies...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to determine whether a positive <b>bronchodilator</b> response to the anticholinergic ipratropium bromide could predict airway hyperresponsiveness in patients with persistent allergic asthma. The study comprised 40 patients with mild and moderate persistent allergic asthma.

Materials and methods: The medical records of 166 patients with clinically stable bronchiectasis who underwent baseline pre- and postbronchodilator spirometry and repeated spirometry after 3 – 12 months of <b>bronchodilator</b> therapy were retrospectively reviewed. For analysis, patients were divided into two groups, responders and poor responders, based on achievement of at least 12 % and 200 mL in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) following <b>bronchodilator</b> therapy from baseline FEV 1. Results: A total of 57 patients (34. 3 %) were responders.

25|$|Specific pretreatments, {{drugs to}} prevent {{chemically}} induced lung injuries due to respiratory airway toxins, are not available. Analgesic medications, oxygen, humidification, and ventilator support currently constitute standard therapy.

Pressure control ventilation is more versatile than volume control, although breaths should be volume limited, to prevent stretch injury to the alveoli. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is used in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS to improve oxygenation. Hemorrhaging, signifying substantial damage to the lining of the airways and lungs, can occur with exposure to highly corrosive chemicals and may require additional medical interventions.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{role played}} by the {{interaction}} of nitric oxide (NO) and endothelins (ET) in the modulation of airway function, and the modulation of β-adrenergic-mediated <b>bronchodilator</b> responses by ascorbic acid in {{the presence or absence of}} endogenous NO induced by ET in anesthetized guinea-pigs was examined. Endothelins induced a concentration-dependent increase in respiratory resistance, and pretreatment with the NO synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methylester, (L-NAME), significantly increased ET-mediated bronchoconstriction. In addition, ET- 3 -mediated bronchoconstriction following pretreatment with L-NAME was reversed by L-arginine. These findings suggest that the response to the administration of ET- 3 can be attributed to the release of NO from the guinea-pig airway. Neither inhaled isoproterenol nor salbutamol significantly affected ET- 3 -mediated bronchoconstriction, but pretreatment with L-NAME markedly enhanced isoproterenol-mediated bronchodilatation. These findings suggest that endogenous NO induced by ET- 3 may attenuate isoproterenol-mediated <b>bronchodilator</b> responses. Ascorbic acid, an antioxidant, enhanced isoproterenol-mediated <b>bronchodilator</b> responses following precontraction with ET- 3, but pretreatment with L-NAME reduced this effect of ascorbic acid. The findings suggest that ascorbic acid attenuates the effect of endogenous NO on β-adrenergic- mediated <b>bronchodilator</b> response via its antioxidant activity. Since 10 − 7 mol/L ET- 1 does not induce the release of NO from the guinea-pig airway, ascorbic acid cannot enhance isoproterenol-mediated <b>bronchodilator</b> responses. It seems likely that endogenous NO plays an important regulatory role in modulating β-adrenergic-mediated <b>bronchodilator</b> responses in the airway...|$|R

The <b>bronchodilator</b> effects of salbutamol are attributed entirely to (R) -salbutamol (levosalbutamol), while (S) -salbutamol has been shown to possess bronchospastic and pro-inflammatory effects both in vitro and in vivo studies. Levosalbutamol, the (R) -enantiomer of salbutamol is currently available only in a liquid formulation for use via a nebulizer. Recently, levosalbutamol to be administered via a pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) has been developed.
