500|$|Dan J. Kroll of {{the website}} SoapCentral {{wrote that the}} process to find a {{replacement}} for Tom was an [...] "exhaustive search". Amelia Heinle, who critics praised for her portrayal of Victoria, has been listed on the [...] "Top 5 Actresses" [...] poll of CBS Soaps In Depth for over eight consecutive weeks. [...] Her relationship with Billy has garnered a significant fan following, allowing them to lead CBS Soaps In Depths [...] "Top 10 Couples" [...] poll for over six consecutive weeks. Elinor Donahue, who portrayed the judge that marries Victoria and <b>Billy,</b> <b>said</b> she thought their [...] "retro wedding" [...] was [...] "adorable" [...] and [...] "extremely well written and not overdone". Zap2it placed Victoria and Billy at number four of their [...] "10 Best Soap Couples of 2011". Jamey Giddens of Zap2it said Victoria and Billy are [...] "so scrumptious together", and that [...] "it's so nice to have some reason to say something kind about The Young and the Restless for a change". Giddens {{also said that he}} [...] "adores this pairing that he was so prepared to hate". Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote of their relationship: [...] "Billy (Billy Miller) and Victoria (Amelia Heinle), who have already had three weddings in the year and a half that they have been together, actually seem rational. They should change the wedding vows in the G.C. from [...] "until death to us part," [...] to [...] "until one of us changes our mind." [...] However, Bibel was later unfavorable of the couple attempting to have a child less than six months after marrying.|$|E
2500|$|Brown was {{introduced}} to Harold Prince through his association with Daisy Prince, and was hired to write songs for the Broadway musical Parade, based on the trial and lynching of Leo Frank. Parade, directed by Hal Prince, and with a book by Alfred Uhry, won Brown the 1999 Tony Award for Best Original Musical Score. During this production, Livent, one of the producers of Parade, pulled out after reviews were not as positive as they'd hoped. RCA Victor, the other major producer, decided it would pull out as well. Brown said of the event in 1999, [...] "Livent dropped out shortly after the reviews came out. They announced they would not spend another dime on the show. RCA had an agreement to record all of Livent's shows. But when Livent pulled out of 'Parade,' the RCA higher-ups said they were pulling out, too. I {{had to go to}} Billy Rosenfield and ask him: 'What if we pay for this record and you just distribute it?' <b>Billy</b> <b>said,</b> 'Sure.'" [...] Brown had to try to scrounge money from every corner, [...] "In the end, RCA put in $25,000, Lincoln Center put in a big chunk, around $200,000, including the producer Scott Rudin's $25,000, and there was a contribution from the Gilman and Gonzalez-Falla foundation, which has helped support a lot of musical theatre composers over the years, of $40,000. Even Roy Furman, the new guy at Livent, gave us a little money. Somehow, we pulled it together." [...] Livent also was struggling at the time because the company had mishandled funds while allying for bankruptcy protection.|$|E
