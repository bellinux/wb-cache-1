The burden of near-roadway air pollution (NRAP) generally has not been examined, despite evidence of a causal link with CHD.; We investigated the CHD burden from NRAP and compared it with the PM 2. 5 burden in the California South Coast Air Basin for 2008 and under a compact urban growth greenhouse gas reduction scenario for 2035.; We estimated the population attributable fraction and number of CHD events attributable to residential traffic density, proximity to a major road, elemental carbon (EC), and PM 2. 5 compared with the expected disease burden if the population were exposed to background levels of air pollution.; In 2008, an estimated 1, 300 CHD deaths (6. 8 % of the total) were attributable to traffic density, 430 deaths (2. 4 %) to residential proximity to a major road, and 690 (3. 7 %) to EC. There were 1, 900 deaths (10. 4 %) attributable to PM 2. 5. Although reduced exposures in 2035 should result in smaller fractions of CHD attributable to traffic density, EC, and PM 2. 5, the numbers of estimated deaths attributable {{to each of these}} exposures are anticipated to increase to 2, 500, 900, and 2, 900, respectively, due to population aging. A similar pattern of increasing NRAP-attributable CHD hospitalizations was estimated to occur between 2008 and 2035.; These results suggest that a large burden of preventable CHD mortality is attributable to NRAP and is likely to increase even with decreasing exposure by 2035 due to vulnerability of an aging population.

40|$|Future {{fossil fuel}} {{scarcity}} and environmental degradation {{have demonstrated the}} need for renewable, low-carbon sources of energy to power an increasingly industrialized world. Solar energy, with its extraordinary resource base, {{is one of the}} most feasible long-term options for satisfying energy demand with minimal environmental impact. However, solar photovoltaic panels remain expensive and employ materials whose resource bases cannot satisfy global, terawatt-level penetration. This necessitates the development of cheap, earth-abundant semiconductors for solar conversion such as cuprous oxide (Cu₂O). Poor solar energy conversion efficiency (10 nanoseconds, minority carrier diffusion length could easily exceed the film thickness. The photoelectrochemical minority carrier diffusion length measurement achieves success on gallium arsenide test samples, determining flat-band potential, quantum efficiency, and minority carrier diffusion length, paving the way for future Cu₂O measurement.

The character, {{origin and}} palaeoenvironmental {{significance}} of the Wonderkrater spring mound, South Africa. Journal of African Earth Sciences, 58 (1), 115 - 126. Wonderkrater is a spring mound consisting entirely of peat in excess of 8 m thick. It has yielded a pollen record extending back over 35, 000 years, which has provided {{one of the very}} few proxy climatic records for the interior of southern Africa in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. The current investigation of the morphology and sedimentology of the site has revealed that the peat mound formed due to artesian conditions at the spring, but that accumulation of the thick peat succession was made possible because of clastic sedimentation on the surrounding piedmont which in turn was brought about by aggradation on the adjacent Nyl River floodplain. The peat mound has remained elevated relative to the surrounding piedmont for most of the 35, 000 year period. Aggradation of the mound was slower during the Late Pleistocene than the Holocene (0. 06 ? 0. 1 m/ 1000 year and 0. 2 ? 0. 38 m/ 1000 year, respectively). Controlled archaeological excavations yielded a diverse late Pleistocene fauna preserved in peat and sand in the mound. A 1 m thick, coarse sand horizon at the base of the peat deposit contained a rich Middle Stone Age (> 30 k year) lithic assemblage. The MSA sand layer likely represents an arid phase, suggesting the site?s antiquity as a place of refuge for Quaternary animals and the people that hunted them.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{fabricated}} and characterized {{a series}} of thin-film cuprous oxide (Cu₂O) photovoltaic devices. I constructed several different device designs, using sputtered and electrochemically deposited Cu₂O. Characterization was done using XRD, SEM, optical spectroscopy, quantum efficiency, current-voltage, and capacitance-voltage measurements. Then, these devices were modeled using SCAPS- 1 D, a numerical simulation package, as well as MATLAB for analytical solutions. This simulation enabled a quantitative breakdown of efficiency losses in Cu 20 devices. Simulations suggest that low device efficiencies of 0. 3 - 0. 6 % may be explained in part by poor bulk transport properties in the Cu₂O. However, the predominant efficiency loss comes from an unoptimized p-n heterojunction, in which a large negative conduction band offset and structural defects lead to a low built-in voltage and high recombination activity. The effects of interface engineering are demonstrated in experiment and simulation. Broader simulations suggest opportunities for future efficiency improvements towards 10 %. These include the improvement of bulk properties, the selection of alternative pairing materials, novel device structures, {{and the possibility of}} multijunction cells. by Riley Eric <b>Brandt.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> M.)

Geographical variation in each species has been compiled {{with reference to}} samples that span their distribution ranges in Southeast Asia and some parts of neighbouring areas such as East Asia, the Indian Ocean, and Africa. Comparative study of traditional taxonomic characters from external morphology provides further information to distinguish some closely related species. Scolopendra cataracta Siriwut, Edgecombe & Panha, sp. n., is described from {{the southern part of}} Laos, with additional records in Thailand and Vietnam. The phylogenetic framework for Southeast Asian Scolopendra recognizes S. calcarata + S. pinguis, S. morsitans, and a S. subspinipes group that unites the other six species as the main clades. Within the S. subspinipes group, two monophyletic groups can be distinguished by having either slender or short, thick ultimate leg prefemora and different numbers of apical spines on the coxopleuron. Scolopendra arborea Lewis, 1982, is placed in subjective synonymy with S. dehaani.

(Microthele) nobilis Selenka, Stichopus chloronotus <b>Brandt</b> and <b>S.</b> variegatus Semper) {{were subjected to}} multiple choice experiments. As a food source, sediments were pre-cultivated in petri dishes under different light and nutrient regimes. This resulted in four sediment treatments with different levels of microalgal biomass (measured as chlorophyll a and phaeophytin concentrations). Only two sediment treatments were used for experiments with H. nobilis and S. variegatus. The sediments were offered simultaneously to individual holothurians (six per experiment), and the weights of the sediment in each petri dish at the start and after 48 h were used to calculate a selection index together with confidence intervals for each food type. In experiments with H. atra and H. edulis, the animals exhibited no preference for any food type. In contrast, S. chloronotus significantly selected sediments with the highest contents of microalgae and avoided the sediment with the lowest pigment concentrations. These results were supported by field collections of sediments found directly underneath holothurians. Sediment underneath H. edulis {{did not differ from}} the average sediment of the habitat, while H. atra was found on sediments only slightly higher in chlorophyll a. Chlorophyll a concentrations underneath S. chloronotus were distinctly higher than in the adjacent sediment and that underneath H. atra. H. nobilis showed only a weak preference for sediments with higher pigment concentrations in aquarium experiments, and no patch selectivity in this species was found in the field. Stichopus variegatus exhibited a very distinct patch selectivity towards sediments with more nutritional value in both aquaria experiments and field measurements. Thus members of the genus Holothuria had no, or only a weak, tendency to select their food source, whereas both Stichopus species appeared to carefully select the sediment patch to feed on...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} ontologies {{available}} today, more than 10, 000 as identified by dedicated search engines, {{is a good}} indicator of the progress made so far. Ontologies are developed for and used in several applications ranging from knowledge representation and semantic search up to data integration and web service discovery (Cheung, Cheung & Kwok 2012) (Trokanas, Cecelja & Raafat 2013, Raafat et al. 2013 b) (Raafat et al. 2013 a). Much of recent ontology development efforts {{have been reported in}} the domain of Process Systems Engineering (give references from review). It is the fact that ontologies are by definition conceptualisations that are supposed to be shared and reused (Gruber 1993, Gruber 1995). Ontology reuse is a practical and useful approach for knowledge engineers. It has the potential to reduce the cost of developing ontology from scratch (24), as well as promote interoperability among applications (6). In addition, many of the existing ontologies cover similar or overlapping domains (14). Ontology reuse is also part of many of existing frameworks and established methodologies (Noy, McGuinness 2001, López et al. 1999) for ontology development. However, by reviewing the literature (Bock et al. 2010, Brandt et al. 2008, Fernandes et al. 2011, Giménez et al. 2008), it became apparent that ontology reuse is a seldom occurring task. Researchers have identified a lack in robust (27) and pragmatic (24) methods for evaluating and identifying ontologies for reuse. This paper presents a metric for the evaluation of ontologies for reuse. The metric account for ontology metadata such as the datatypes, external resources, terminology and languages used for modelling. It also accounts for structural characteristics of ontologies such as size, breadth and width of the evaluated ontologies. All the available information is translated into vectors which are consequently compared. The resulting similarity scores for each aspect are aggregated and normalised into a single metric ranging between [0, 1]. The metric has been tested and verified using experiments for the development of an ontology for the domain of Industrial Symbiosis.

40|$|The {{history of}} {{conflict}} between double-crested cormorants (Figure 1) and human interest in fisheries is long and convoluted. Following a low point in the 1970 <b>s,</b> populations of <b>cormorants</b> expanded in North America, as did concerns about impacts on fisheries. By the late 1990 s, natural resource agencies in 27 states reported losses of free-ranging fish stocks to cormorants. Agencies in 10 states, ranging from the Southwest to the Northeast, considered cormorant predation to be of moderate to major concern to fishery management. Overall, double-crested cormorants are not major consumers of commercial and sportfish species. However, exceptions have been recorded at specific sites with documented impacts on local fisheries (see Damage to Fisheries section). Cormorants often congregate and can have significant local impacts where high concentrations of fish occur, such as stocking release sites, private fishing ponds, aquaculture ponds, reservoirs, spawning sites, and other areas. Cormorants may be managed whenever their damage justi-fies the granting of the permits necessary to control them. Adult cormorants eat approximately 19 ounces of food per day, so local impacts of large flocks on fisheries can be substantial. Although cormorants frequently are blamed for reductions in fish harvests, {{this is not always}} substantiat-ed. Sometimes other factors, such as pollution, invasive species, and habitat loss may be the primary factor or con-tributing factors in the decline of fisheries...|$|R

Data reduction leaves 62 quasars, 35 radio-loud and 27 radio-quiet, suitable for spectral analysis.

A correlation between Gamma and opticalH-beta was also found for the radio-quiet quasars in this sample, whereby thesteepest X-ray spectra tend {{to be found in}} those objects with narrow H-betawidths. The correlation is significant at > 99 onfidence, confirming thewell-known trend between Gamma and H-beta FWHM in Seyfert 1 <b>s</b> (<b>Brandt</b> et al. 1997), but at higher luminosities. Other spectral complexities are observedfrom this sample. A soft X-ray excess, with blackbody temperatures in the range 100 - 300 eV, is seen in many low z radio-quiet quasars. In most cases thetemperatures are probably too hot to originate directly from the disk. Iron Kline emission features are also found in the RQQs; but often from partiallyionised material. Indeed in the highest luminosity RQQs there is neitherevidence for iron line emission nor the reflection component expected from diskmodels. These observations can be explained by an increase in the quasaraccretion rate with luminosity, leading to an increase in the ionisation stateof the surface layers of the disk. The occurrence of ionised or `warm'absorbers is rare in this sample, with only 5 detections. However excessneutral X-ray absorption is found towards several of the high z, predominantlyradio-loud, quasars.

Geological {{controls}} on the formation of alluvial meanders and floodplain wetlands: The example of the Klip River, eastern Free State, South Africa. Earth Surface Processes and Landforms, 27 (8), 797 - 815. Floodplain wetlands are common features of rivers in southern Africa, {{but they have been}} little studied from a geological or geomorphological perspective. Study of the upper Klip River, eastern Free State, South Africa, indicates strong geological {{controls on}} the formation of alluvial meanders and associated floodplain wetlands. Along this river, pronounced and abrupt changes in valley width are strongly linked to lithological variations. Where weakly cemented sandstone crops out, the Klip has laterally eroded bedrock and carved valleys up to 1500 m wide. In these valleys, the river meanders (sinuosity up to similar to 1. 75) on moderate gradients (0. 003), the river follows a much straighter course (sinuosity similar to 1. 10 - 1. 34), and floodplains are restricted in width. Long-term landscape development in the Klip and numerous similar catchments depends on the interaction between fluvial processes in the sandstone and dolerite valleys. In the sandstone valleys, vertical erosion rates are controlled by erosion rates of the more resistant dolerites downstream. Hence, in the short- to medium-term (decades {{to tens of thousands of}} years), lateral erosion dominates over vertical erosion, with the river concomitantly planing sandstone in the channel floor and reworking floodplain sediments. The thickness of alluvial fill in the sandstone valleys is limited (Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|For the {{generation}} and detection of pure spin currents via the (inverse) spin Hall effect, {{a combination of}} a non-ferromagnetic metal and an insulating ferrimagnet is used. Thin films of platinum (Pt) grown on yttrium iron garnet (Y 3 Fe 5 O 12, YIG) often serve as prototype structures [1 - 3]. Recently, the influence of the interface quality between the two materials on the spin Hall effect came into focus and the importance of a surface treatment of YIG was discussed [3 - 7]. We present a systematic study of Pt thin film growth on YIG single crystals. The YIG crystals were exposed to different surface treatments prior to the Pt deposition. Pt thin films were grown under UHV conditions at different substrate temperatures by thermal evaporation utilizing the JCNS molecular beam epitaxy system which is also open to users in the framework of neutron experiments performed at the MLZ (www. mlz-garching. de). Surface science methods like in-situ Auger-electron-spectroscopy, reflection high/low energy electron diffraction, ex-situ x-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy were utilized for sample quality control. The spin Hall magnetoresistance is characterized via magnetization orientation dependent resistance measurements in a superconducting magnet cryostat. Best Pt growth results are achieved when the YIG substrate is annealed prior to thin film growth. Growth at room temperature yields higher film roughness while at higher temperatures the risk of Pt oxidation increases. At about 900 °C substrate temperature interdiffusion takes place. Optimum Pt thin film growth is found at about 500 °C where a texture of the Pt film is observed. In our presentation we discuss the influence of the YIG crystal surface treatment and different growth parameters {{on the quality of the}} Pt films in detail and address their impact on the spin Hall magnetoresistance effect.

A {{comparison}} of mud- and sand-dominated meanders in a downstream coarsening {{reach of the}} mixed bedrock-alluvial Klip River, eastern Free State, South Africa. Sedimentary Geology, 190 (1 - 4), 213 - 226. Along a 28 km reach of the Klip River, eastern Free State, South Africa, mud- and sand-dominated meanders have developed in close proximity within a floodplain wetland up to 1. 5 km wide, providing an unusual opportunity to compare their characteristics under similar hydrological conditions. Throughout the reach, the channel bed is grounded on sandstone/shale bedrock although the banks are alluvial, and most river activity occurs during summer high flows. The reach {{can be divided into}} three geomorphological zones: Zone 1 (0 ? 11 km), a muddy proximal part with a single meandering channel (w/d < 10) and near-permanent standing water in oxbows and backswamps; Zone 2 (11 ? 17. 5 km), a transitional mud-to-sand part with one main channel (w/d not, vert, similar 20 ? 30), a number of sinuous palaeochannels and oxbows, and only limited standing water; and Zone 3 (17. 5 ? 28 km), a sandy distal part with a single meandering channel (w/d not, vert, similar 15 ? 30), scroll bars and oxbows, and little standing water. Each zone also has a distinctive sedimentology: Zone 1 is characterised by an not, vert, similar 3 ? 4 m thick succession of basal sand and minor granules overlain by dominantly muddy sediment deposited primarily by oblique accretion in meander bends; Zone 2 is characterised by < 4 m of interbedded sand and mud deposited primarily by lateral point-bar accretion, although a history of avulsions also attests to the importance of abandoned-channel accretion; and Zone 3 is characterised by < 3 m of dominantly sand deposited primarily by lateral point-bar accretion. This unusual downstream sediment coarsening trend, and the associated changes in channel and floodplain character, are independent of sediment inputs from tributaries, and result from a downstream increase in bankfull unit stream power from < 3. 5 W m? 2 (Zone 1) to not, vert, similar 4 ? 10 W m? 2 (Zone 3). Mud is deposited primarily in low-energy Zone 1 but is conveyed in suspension more effectively through higher energy Zones 2 and 3, only forming drapes over sandy lateral accretion deposits during waning flood stages. The downstream increase in unit stream power is controlled in part by a slight downstream increase in floodplain gradient that may be related to a subtle variation in the erosional resistance of the bedrock underlying the channel bed. These findings add to previous work on meandering rivers by demonstrating that mud-dominated meanders can occur in long-term erosional settings where the channel bed is grounded on bedrock, and that downstream fining trends may be reversed locally.
