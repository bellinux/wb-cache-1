5|$|Horse rings, {{remnants}} {{of a time when}} horses and horse-drawn vehicles provided the primary mode of transportation, can be found throughout Portland, Oregon.

5|$|During this time, Alexander adopted some {{elements}} of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of proskynesis, either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors.

5|$|From the mid-14th century, {{after the}} Black Death, Norman {{settlements}} in Ireland {{went into a}} period of decline. The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became Gaelicised. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the Irish parliament passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367. These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into Irish society <b>by</b> <b>requiring</b> English subjects in Ireland to speak English, follow English customs and abide by English law.|$|E

5|$|Further, birds {{recall and}} avoid {{objects that are}} both {{conspicuous}} and foul-tasting longer than objects that are equally foul-tasting but cryptically coloured. This suggests that Wallace's original view, that warning colouration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus coloured, was correct. However, some birds (inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks) also innately avoid conspicuously coloured objects, as demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps, with dull green controls. This implies that warning coloration works {{at least in part}} by stimulating the evolution of predators to encode the meaning of the warning signal, rather than <b>by</b> <b>requiring</b> each new generation to learn the signal's meaning.|$|E
5|$|In January 2003, Obama became {{chairman}} of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.

During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms. Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|The Hiroc missile used {{liquid oxygen}} as its oxidizer, and alcohol for its fuel. The Hiroc missile {{did not have}} {{separate}} tanks for its fuel and oxidizer, which were instead contained in one tank separated by a bulkhead. The frame of the rocket {{was supported by the}} pressure of the gas inside the tank, which would be either propellant when used, or inert gasses when stored.

5|$|The {{building}} was constructed after the Carnegie grant approval, and its first use came in October 1908 by Leon A. Malkielski, a colony member, for {{an exhibition of}} 100 paintings. The library proper did not begin providing its services until 1909. The colony tried to contribute to area culture <b>by</b> <b>requiring</b> its members to hold art shows, lectures, and other exhibitions throughout the early 20th century. With the library complete it began {{to play a role}} in those exhibitions. Hamlin Garland, a 1921 Pulitzer Prize recipient for literature, spoke at the Oregon library while he was a member of the Eagle's Nest Colony.|$|E

5|$|Alison Young {{argues that}} Jackson entrenched section 2(1) of the Parliament Act 1911 <b>by</b> <b>requiring</b> {{that it only}} be {{overturned}} by adopting a specific manner and form (approval of the bill changing the 1911 Act by the House of Lords). She suggests that Lord Steyn and Baroness Hale would explain this result using a self-embracing view of sovereignty – that Parliament {{as a whole is}} sovereign and can therefore to bind later parliaments. The passing of the 1911 Act was from this perspective a redefinition of Parliament that binds the courts. However, she notes that Lord Hope, Lord Nicholls and Lord Carswell provide an alternative explanation for the decision: that the 1911 Act modified the rule of recognition defining valid legal documents. Under this view, the 1911 Parliament did not bind future Parliaments simply by passing the Parliament Act 1911, but by the legislation being recognised, in political fact, as valid; the courts were therefore altering the legal rule of recognition accordingly. This perspective allows the orthodox continuing view of parliamentary sovereignty (that every new parliament is sovereign) to be held while still explaining why future parliaments cannot modify section 2(1) of the 1911 Act.|$|E

5|$|Federal law prohibits {{alcoholic}} beverages from being shipped through the mail. New Jersey effectively prohibits the shipment {{of beer and}} spirits to customers <b>by</b> <b>requiring</b> a liquor license to transport alcohol, but not having any class of liquor license that grants permission to ship beer or spirits. United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express will ship wine to a person's home, but will only deliver beer or hard liquor to a licensed business. Although uncommon, it is legal for a liquor store to deliver {{alcoholic beverages}} by car or van to a person's home. ABC regulations mandate that the alcoholic beverages being delivered are paid for in advance, that they are received by someone 21 or older, and that they take place when the licensed establishment is permitted to be open.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{the hotel}} {{fell into a}} {{turbulent}} period. Terrorist threats from the Irish Republican Army became the chief concern, and bomb scares were not uncommon. The oil crisis in the early 1970s directly affected business and prompted the Bracewell-Smith family to sell their stake to Trafalgar House on 5 April 1976 for £2.75m. At {{the time of the}} sale, the hotel's occupancy rate was just 45 percent; the Ritz Grill Room had been closed and it had lost quite a bit of money in recent times. In 1984, the Ritz brought back its weekly Sunday tea dances which were popular during the 1920s and 1930s. Because of demand, the hotel considered restricting afternoon tea at the Ritz to hotel guests only, as those staying at the Ritz were often unable to get a table. Many Londoners who would have been barred by this restriction voiced disapproval and the Ritz compromised <b>by</b> <b>requiring</b> reservations for afternoon tea at the hotel. Proper attire for tea is a must; the Ritz once refused to admit Mick Jagger for tea because he was not wearing a jacket and tie.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 2008, Miami-Dade Transit {{announced}} that it would be replacing all fare collection methods with the Easy Card system by late 2009. The system replaces the old cash and token-based system with one that automatically deducts fares at Metrorail fare gates from a reloadable card. The final station to start fare gate installation was Government Center on August 2, 2009. Since the system launch on October 1, 2009, all passengers using Metrorail must use either an Easy Card or Easy Ticket to enter stations. For almost the full first year of use, the Easy Card ticket vending machines allowed anyone to purchase thousands of dollars worth of Easy Cards by credit card without entering a PIN or billing zip code, which led to credit card thieves putting high dollar values on Easy Cards and selling them at a discounted rate for cash. Miami-Dade Transit initially mitigated this issue by limiting credit card transactions to three per day and a value limit of $112, and later <b>by</b> <b>requiring</b> zip code verification for all cards.|$|E

5|$|One {{question}} of constitutional interpretation that was highlighted during the parliamentary debates pertained {{to the former}} Article 22H which had been incorrectly inserted into the Constitution by the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1991 in January 1991. Article 22H(1) provided that the President might, acting in his discretion, withhold his assent to any bill passed by Parliament (other than a bill to which Article 5(2A) applied) if the bill provided for the circumvention or curtailment of the discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Constitution. At that time, Article 5(2A), which entrenched certain core constitutional provisions (of which Article 22H(1) was one) <b>by</b> <b>requiring</b> {{the approval of the}} electorate at a national referendum for their amendment, had not been brought into force.|$|E
5|$|Other {{finishing}} {{moves in}} the various Mortal Kombat games include Animalities (introduced in Mortal Kombat 3) turning a victor into an animal to violently finish off the opponent; Brutality (introduced in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3) which is bashing an opponent into pieces with a long combo of hits; and Stage Fatalities/Death Traps (introduced in the original Mortal Kombat Pit Stage where the victor can uppercut their opponent off of the platform into a bed of spikes below, and later made more difficult in Mortal Kombat II <b>by</b> <b>requiring</b> specific and different button sequences to be pressed) utilizing parts of certain stages to execute a lethal finishing move (such as a pool of acid). Mortal Kombat: Deception added the Hara-Kiri, a self-Fatality allowing the losers {{to engage in a}} suicide-based finishing move (enabling a possible race between both players to see if the winning player can finish off the losing player before the losing character can kill himself or herself first).|$|E
