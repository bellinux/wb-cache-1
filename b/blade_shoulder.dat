5000|$|Pull-ups use the teres major, a small muscle at {{the back}} of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade.</b> The nearby rhomboids, which connect the spine to the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade,</b> play a part too. Pull-ups also use the {{trapezius}} along the spine and shoulder, and the levator scapulae along the side of the neck. These muscles work to elevate and depress the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade,</b> and are sometimes called the [...] "shrugging muscles." ...|$|R
2500|$|After the Middle Ages, {{the name}} scapula for <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade</b> became dominant. The word scapula can {{etymologically}} {{be explained by}} its relatedness to ancient Greek verb σκάπτειν, to dig. This relatedness give rise to several possible explanations. First, the noun σκάπετος, trench [...] derived from this verb, and the to scapula related noun σκαφη, similarly derived from the aforementioned verb, might connect scapula {{to the notion of}} (con)cavity. The name scapula might be related that due to existence of the spine of the scapula a concavity exist in the scapula. Otherwise, the designation scapulae is also seen as synonym of ancient Greek συνωμία, the space between the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blades,</b> that is obviously concave. Συνωμία consists of σύν, together with, and ὦμος, shoulder. Second, scapula, due to its relatedness to σκάπτειν might originally meant shovel. Similarly to the resemblance between the Latin pala (spade) and the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade,</b> a resemblance might be felt between the shape of a shovel and the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade.</b> Alternatively, the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade</b> might be used originally for digging and shoveling.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shoulder}} pads {{consist of a}} hard plastic outer shell with shock-absorbing foam padding underneath. The pads fit over the shoulders and the chest and rib area, and are secured with various snaps and buckles. Shoulder pads give football players their typical [...] "broad-shouldered" [...] look, and are fitted to an adult player by measuring across the player's back from <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade</b> to <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade</b> with a soft cloth measuring tape and then adding 1/2 inch. For comfort, {{shoulder pads}} are sometimes worn {{in conjunction with a}} shoulder pads cushion of foam rubber over a cotton half-tee.|$|R
50|$|In neolithic {{times and}} earlier a large animal's scapula (<b>shoulder</b> <b>blade)</b> was {{often used as}} a crude shovel or spade. It is via this {{connection}} between <b>shoulder</b> <b>blades</b> and digging blades that the words spatula and spade both have etymologic connection with scapulas.|$|R
25|$|The Roman {{physician}} Caelius Aurelianus (5th century) used pala {{to refer}} to the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade.</b> The name pala is normally used {{to refer to}} a spade in Latin and was therefore probably used by Caelius Aurelianus to describe the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade,</b> as both exhibit a flat curvature.|$|R
50|$|The glenoid labrum (glenoid ligament) is a fibrocartilaginous (fibrocartilage) rim {{attached}} {{around the}} margin of the glenoid cavity in the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade.</b> The <b>shoulder</b> joint is considered a ball and socket joint. However, in bony terms the 'socket' (the glenoid fossa of the scapula) is quite shallow and small, covering at most only a third of the 'ball' (the head of the humerus). The socket is deepened by the glenoid labrum.|$|R

40|$|In illegal hunting it {{is often}} {{possible}} only {{on the basis of}} morphological characteristics to determine the animal species. By the method of comparison there was performed the forensic analysis of roe deer and sheep osteological features. For the purpose of investigating the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade</b> (Scapula) and <b>shoulder</b> bone (Humerus) comparative characteristics, there were used 6 <b>shoulder</b> <b>blades</b> and 6 <b>shoulder</b> bones of roe deer and 8 <b>shoulder</b> <b>blades</b> and 8 <b>shoulder</b> bones of sheep. After the skin, muscles, arterial, venous and lymphatic vessels as well as nerves were removed from the bones, they were thermally treated in an autoclave. Subsequently, the bones were placed in 3 % solutioin of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) for bleaching and degreasing. Then they were air dried and then photographed. <b>Shoulder</b> <b>blade</b> (Scapula) is a bone plate (Ossa plana) roughly triangular in shape. Scapular spine (Spina scapulae) is much more prominent in roe deer with acromion blade in the form of spike, while in sheep it is shorter and ends with acrimion at a right angle. <b>Shoulder</b> <b>blade</b> cup (Cavitas glenoidalis) in roe deer is round in shape, and in sheep it is oval. Tuberculum supraglenoidale and Processus coracoideus in sheep are more and in roe deer less developed. Shoulder bone (Humerus) in roe deer is relatively long, slender bone with proximal convexity turned cranially in regard to the same bone in sheep, which is stronger and heavier. Tuberculum majus in roe deer is less developed, and in sheep it is in a form of solid bone protuberance. Tuberculum minus and Tuberositas deltoidea in sheep are more developed than in roe deer. At medial condyle (Condylus medialis) in sheep there is shallow and wide groove, while in roe deer it is deeper and narrower. On the basis of morphological differences of roe deer and sheep bones, it can be determined with certainty which animal spesies they belong to...|$|R
