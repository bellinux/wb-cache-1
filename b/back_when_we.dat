500|$|A. O. Scott of The New York Times was not {{impressed}} with Reeves' performance, commenting that [...] "even Klaatu looks bored and distracted, {{much as he}} did <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> knew him as Neo." [...] William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave the film a B minus and wrote, [...] "It's a decent enough stab at being what the old movie was to its time, following the same basic plot, full of respectful references to its model, updated with a gallery of fairly imaginative special effects." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars and noted that the film had [...] "taken its title so seriously that the plot stands still along with it", but also stated that it was [...] "an expensive, good-looking film that is well-made by Scott Derrickson". Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two stars and wrote in her review she felt the film was [...] "musty and derivative" [...] and thought its only bright spot was 10-year-old Jaden Smith's [...] "engaging, lively performance".|$|E
50|$|What helped {{our journey}} was the {{knowledge}} {{that we were not}} alone - our readers stood by us through thick and thin. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> did a good job, they patted our <b>backs.</b> <b>When</b> <b>we</b> occasionally failed to deliver as per our usual high standards, they gently reprimanded us. By keeping us on our toes, they spurred us to give our best. By consistently sending us three-year subscriptions, they provided stability to our aspirations. Without a doubt, we owe the biggest debt of gratitude to them.|$|R

2500|$|He {{wrote that}} [...] "Christian faith has {{been central to}} the {{emergence}} of the nation and its development. We cannot really understand the nature and achievements of British society without reference to it. In a plural, multifaith and multicultural situation, it can still provide the resources for both supporting and critiquing public life in this country.

2500|$|After von Neumann’s {{death in}} 1957, the faculty {{organized}} {{a committee to}} terminate the project. All the permanent faculty met in Oppenheimer’s living room. As Cherniss explained, ‘This was <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> used to do things right. Everything was informal.’ After the final decision was made, Cherniss elaborated ‘But we passed a more general motion. It was a declaration to have no experimental science, no laboratories of any kind at the Institute.' In his history, Regis remarked ‘And so it has been ever since. The Platonic-heavenly fathers [...] had triumphed.’ Another faculty member, the physicist Freeman Dyson, said simply ‘The snobs took revenge.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1969, after Bill Mallory {{was hired}} as the head {{football}} coach at Miami, Burton {{was hired as}} an assistant coach at Miami.

He was a darn good coach. I knew he'd be the kind of person I would want on my staff. I knew he would be a good teacher of the game."

60|$|This {{gesture of}} our comrade's soothed me somewhat, for I began to fancy {{he had a}} plan in his mind to thwart our host if so be he gave token of treachery, and yet I failed to {{understand}} {{how it might be}} done while we remained there much the same as prisoners. In my stupidity I lost {{sight of the fact that}} we were absolutely powerless. If this Job Lord was indeed double-faced, then at the moment we ventured out despite his advice, it was only necessary for him to give word to the lobster <b>backs,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> would, perhaps, come upon Silas by being ourselves made prisoners.|$|R

2500|$|Since her Pulitzer Prize with Breathing Lessons, Tyler {{has written}} eight more novels, {{all of which}} have {{received}} favorable reviews; many have been Book of the Month Club Main Selections and have become New York Times Bestsellers. Ladder of Years was chosen by Time Magazine as one of the ten best books of 1995. [...] A Patchwork Planet was a New York Times Notable Book (1999). [...] Saint Maybe (1991) and <b>Back</b> <b>When</b> <b>We</b> Were Grownups (2001) were adapted into TV movies in 1998 and 2004, respectively.

We were walking <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> noticed this mob of blackfellas in a circle about a hundred yards to our right. They motioned me to play without speaking. I sat down and played {{a little bit and}} they started laughing. I'd always had this {{reservation}} about my first encounter with top dog players and I thought they were rubbishing me, but with traditional black people communication always happens very slowly and that's how it was. After a while I got to understand that they were pleased at seeing it being played by a whitefella with his own spirit. Aboriginal people say I play walla walla didgeridu. very fast, attack style." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Wills' {{return to}} Tulsa late in 1957, Jim Downing of the Tulsa Tribune {{wrote an article}} headlined [...] "Wills Brothers Together Again: Bob Back With Heavy Beat". The article quotes Wills as saying, [...] "Rock and Roll? Why, man, that's {{the same kind of}} music we've been playin' since 1928!... We didn't call it rock and roll <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> {{introduced}} it as our style back in 1928, and we don't call it rock and roll the way we play it now. But it's just basic rhythm and has gone by a lot of different names in my time. It's the same, whether you just follow a drum beat like in Africa or surround it with a lot of instruments. The rhythm's what's important." [...] The use of amplified guitars accentuates Wills's claim; some Bob Wills recordings from the 1930s and 1940s sound similar to rock and roll records of the 1950s.|$|E

60|$|As we {{made our}} way cautiously, noiselessly as Indians might have done, it was {{possible}} to hear loud voices coming from the direction of Hill's wharf, and I had no doubt but that a guard of Britishers was stationed there, being all the more convinced that such was a fact because of our not having come across any of the lobster <b>backs</b> <b>when</b> finally <b>we</b> stood at the corner of Cow lane.|$|R
2500|$|The launch {{edition of}} Standpoint {{magazine}} caused {{controversy in the}} United Kingdom, in which Nazir-Ali called for Christianity to regain a prominent position in public life and blamed the [...] "newfangled and insecurely founded doctrine of multiculturalism" [...] for entrenching the segregation of communities. Nazir-Ali argued that the decline of Christianity {{and the rise of}} liberal values in the UK during the 1960s had created a moral vacuum which radical Islam threatened to fill. He wrote that [...] "We have argued {{that it is necessary to}} understand where we have come from, to guide us to where we are going, and to bring us <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> wander too far from the path of national destiny." [...] The Guardian newspaper devoted its leader to criticising Nazir-Ali, although it described his writing as [...] "neatly underlining 's expressed intent ‘to defend and celebrate Western civilisation’". Nazir-Ali was condemned by the Ramadhan foundation and the President of the National Secular Society, who accused him of [...] "doing the BNP’s work", but was praised by The Daily Telegraph newspaper. Nazir-Ali has himself written against Christian involvement in far-right organisations like the BNP.|$|E
2500|$|In the Katamon quarter, we {{were held}} up by a Jewish Army type jeep placed in a road block and filled with men in Jewish Army uniforms. At the same moment, I saw an armed man coming from this jeep. I took little notice of this because I merely thought it was another checkpoint. However, he put a Tommy gun {{through the open window}} on my side of the car, and fired point blank at Count Bernadotte and Colonel Serot. I also heard shots fired from other points, and there was {{considerable}} confusion... Colonel Serot fell in the seat in back of me, and I saw at once that he was dead. Count Bernadotte bent forward, and I thought {{at the time he was}} trying to get cover. I asked him: 'Are you wounded?' He nodded, and fell <b>back....</b> <b>When</b> <b>we</b> arrived ... I carried the Count inside and laid him on the bed.... I took off the Count's jacket and tore away his shirt and undervest. I saw that he was wounded around the heart and that there was also a considerable quantity of blood on his clothes about it. When the doctor arrived, I asked if anything could be done, but he replied that it was too late.|$|E
