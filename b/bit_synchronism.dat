60|$|Fancy how Pitt's public, lately gloomy and dubious, blazed aloft into joyful {{certainty}} again! Pitt's outlooks {{have been}} really gloomy all this season; nor are the difficulties yet ended, though we hope they will end. Let us add this other <b>bit</b> of <b>Synchronism,</b> which is still of adverse aspect, over Seas; and will be pungently interesting to Pitt and England, {{when they come to}} hear of it.|$|R
50|$|Signalling on {{the forward}} control channel is {{nominally}} continuous with each slot comprising 64 bit code words. The first type is the Control Channel System Codeword (CSCC). This identifies {{the system to}} the mobile radio units and also provides synchronization for the following address codeword. As mentioned {{the second type of}} word is the address codeword. It is the first codeword of any message and it defines the nature of the message. It is possible to send data over the control channel. When this occurs, both the CSCC and the address codewords are displaced with the data appended to the address codeword. The mobile radio unit data structure is somewhat simpler. It consists fundamentally of <b>synchronism</b> <b>bits</b> followed by the address codeword.|$|R
