5|$|In 1806, German {{botanist}} Carl Ludwig Willdenow {{gave it the}} <b>botanical</b> <b>name</b> Ficus australis in Species Plantarum, {{but this}} is a nomen illegitimum as the species already had a validly published name. Italian botanist Guglielmo Gasparrini broke up the genus Ficus in 1844, placing the species in the genus Urostigma as U.rubiginosum. In 1862, Dutch botanist Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel described Urostigma leichhardtii from material collected from Cape Cleveland, Queensland, noting it had affinities to F. rubiginosa. In 1867, he placed Urostigma as a subgenus in the reunited Ficus, which resulted in the taxon becoming Ficus leichhardtii. Miquel also described Ficus leichhardtii variety angustata from Whitsunday Island, later classified as F. shirleyana by Czech botanist Karel Domin. Queensland state botanist Frederick Manson Bailey described Ficus macrophylla variety pubescens in 1911 from Queensland, Domin later renaming it Ficus baileyana. All these taxa were found to be indistinguishable from (and hence reclassified as) F.rubiginosa by Dixon in 2001.|$|E

25|$|Grossular is a calcium-aluminium garnet {{with the}} formula Ca3Al2(SiO4)3, though the calcium may in part be {{replaced}} by ferrous iron and the aluminium by ferric iron. The name grossular {{is derived from the}} <b>botanical</b> <b>name</b> for the gooseberry, grossularia, in reference to the green garnet of this composition that is found in Siberia. Other shades include cinnamon brown (cinnamon stone variety), red, and yellow. Because of its inferior hardness to zircon, which the yellow crystals resemble, they have also been called hessonite from the Greek meaning inferior. Grossular is found in contact metamorphosed limestones with vesuvianite, diopside, wollastonite and wernerite.|$|E
25|$|Botanical work. Much of Müller's botany was {{stimulated by}} the series of botanical works {{published}} by Darwin {{in the years after}} the Origin. Müller made contributions in all these fields. After Darwin's Fertilisation of Orchids (1862) he spent years of work on orchids, sending observations to his brother Hermann and to Darwin. Darwin used some of this work in his second edition of 1877, and Hermann later became famous for his work on pollination. On Climbing plants (1867) Müller lent a letter to Darwin listing 40 genera of climbing plants classified by their method of climbing. The next few months saw more observations, which Darwin had translated and published as Müller's first paper in English. As a botanist, Fritz Müller is denoted by the author abbreviation F.J.Müll. when citing a <b>botanical</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E
25|$|The raintree is {{native to}} a range {{stretching}} from southern Mexico into northern South America and its accepted <b>botanical</b> <b>name,</b> as included in the Australian Plant Census and established in 1916, is Samanea saman (Jacq.) Merr. A plaque outside St David's states that the avenue of trees was planted by Rev. Taffs using seeds obtained from Jamaica by Daniel Hart, one of the area's earliest selectors to whom the land (portion 35) originally belonged; however no evidence has been uncovered to substantiate this account or resolve the incongruity it contains between the year of Hart's death, 1900, and when Taffs become rector at Mossman in 1904. A recent arborist's report estimates the trees are between 80 and 100 years old making the date range {{in which they were}} planted between 1908 and 1928.

25|$|The {{story of}} Chidambaram begins with Lord Shiva strolling into the Thillai Vanam (vanam meaning forest and thillai trees - <b>botanical</b> <b>name</b> Exocoeria agallocha, {{a species of}} {{mangrove}} trees - which currently grows in the Pichavaram wetlands near Chidambaram). In the Thillai forests resided a group of sages or 'rishis' who believed in the supremacy of magic and that God can be controlled by rituals and mantras or magical words. Lord Shiva strolled in the forest with resplendent beauty and brilliance, assuming the form of Bhikshatana, a simple mendicant seeking alms. He was followed by His consort, Vishnu as Mohini. The sages and their wives were enchanted by the brilliance {{and the beauty of}} The handsome mendicant and His consort. On seeing their womenfolk enchanted, the rishis got enraged and invoked scores of serpents (nāgas) by performing magical rituals. Lord Shiva lifted the serpents and donned them as ornaments on His matted locks, neck and waist. Further enraged, the sages invoked a fierce tiger, whose skins and dons were used by Lord Shiva as a shawl around His waist and then followed by a fierce elephant, which was devoured and ripped to death by Lord Shiva (Gajasamharamurthy).|$|E

500|$|Baorangia bicolor was {{originally}} named in 1807 by the Italian botanist Giuseppe Raddi. American mycologist Charles Horton Peck named a species collected in Sandlake, New York, in 1870, Boletus bicolor. Although this naming is considered illegitimate due to [...] of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, Peck is still given as the {{authority in the}} Bessette et al. (2000) monograph of North American boletes. [...] Boletus bicolor (Raddi) is not a synonym of [...] "Boletus bicolor" [...] Peck. [...] Peck's Boletus bicolor describes the Eastern North American species that is the familiar [...] "two-colored bolete", while Raddi's Boletus bicolor describes a separate European species that is lost to science. [...] This taxonomic conflict {{has yet to be}} resolved. In 1909 a species found in Singapore was named Boletus bicolor by George Edward Massee; this naming is illegitimate and is synonymous with Boletochaete bicolor according to Singer. Molecular studies found that Boletus bicolor was not closely related to the type species of Boletus, Boletus edulis, and in 2015 Alfredo Vizzini transferred Boletus bicolor to the genus Baorangia. The original <b>botanical</b> <b>name</b> for this two-colored bolete was derived from the Latin words bōlētus, meaning [...] "mushroom", and bicolor, meaning [...] "having two colors." ...|$|E
