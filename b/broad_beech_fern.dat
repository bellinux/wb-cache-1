50|$|Phegopteris is a genus of ferns known {{collectively as}} the <b>beech</b> <b>ferns.</b> Traditionally this genus {{included}} {{only the first}} three species listed. However, recent genetic evidence clearly shows that the genera Macrothelypteris and Pseudophegopteris, {{as well as other}} segregates from the genus Thelypteris, are closely related to Phegopteris in a single clade, and so are now included as Phegopteris species.|$|R

50|$|The soils in {{this area}} are {{moderately}} fertile and sometimes rich. The land is moderately rugged, discouraging row-crop agriculture. These soils are easily eroded. There is some commercial agriculture in the loessal plains area of the ridge. The ridge is surrounded by the fertile lands of the delta region. The vegetation is predominantly oak and hickory forests, similar to vegetation found in the Appalachian Mountains. Examples are the tulip tree (a yellow poplar) and the American <b>beech.</b> <b>Ferns</b> and flowers abound here, including the American bell flower, crimson catchfly, butterfly weed, cardinal flower, blue lobelia, phlox, verbena, wild hydrangea, hibiscus, aster and yellow jasmine. The low-lying areas around the ridge were once much swampier, and the ridge provided a natural and more healthful place for settlers to establish homes. The ridge became a natural north-south communications link for the region, since travel along the ridge was much easier than through the swampy lowlands.|$|R
50|$|A large {{variety of}} plants and animals reside in the park and the {{steepness}} of the terrain ensures that they are not disturbed by humans. Plant life includes a large variety of eucalypt trees including Snow Gums, subtropical and temperate rainforest trees like Antarctic <b>beech,</b> tree <b>ferns,</b> a large variety of mosses and ferns and a wide range of edible plants such as the native raspberry, the native cherry and the lilli pilli.|$|R
25|$|Pollen {{analysis}} in the sediments of the Waitetuna arm of the harbour shows that the original vegetation was kahikatea on the flats, and a mixed podocarp-hardwood forest on the slopes, with totara, maire, matai, rimu, rata, <b>beech</b> and tree <b>ferns.</b> Kauri was present, but not abundant.|$|R
50|$|The European beech (Fagus sylvatica) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} cultivated, although there are few important differences between species aside from detail elements such as leaf shape. The leaves of beech trees are entire or sparsely toothed, from 5-15 cm long and 4-10 cm <b>broad.</b> <b>Beeches</b> are monoecious, bearing {{both male and female}} flowers on the same plant. The small flowers are unisexual, the female flowers borne in pairs, the male flowers wind-pollinating catkins. They are produced in spring shortly after the new leaves appear. The bark is smooth and light grey. The fruit is a small, sharply three-angled nut 10-15 mm long, borne singly or in pairs in soft-spined husks 1.5-2.5 cm long, known as cupules. The husk can have a variety of spine- to scale-like appendages, the character of which is, in addition to leaf shape, one of the primary ways beeches are differentiated. The nuts are edible, though bitter (though not nearly as bitter as acorns) with a high tannin content, and are called beechnuts or beechmast.|$|R

From 1890 to 1930 80% of the forest was converted to pasture, though some pines have since been planted on former pasture, including 5 km2 by Vela Holdings east of Mangaokahu Stream in 1990-1991. By the mid-1920s indigenous forest was restricted to the steeplands of Mount Karioi, Pirongia and the Moerangi Plateau.|$|R
40|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} northern European medieval glass, {{used in the}} cathedral windows, is the high content of K 2 O and CaO, resulting from the use, after 1000 A. D, of <b>beech</b> and <b>fern</b> ashes as fluxing agents. Three glass varieties with medieval-like composition were prepared using recipes deduced from archaeometric studies with different amounts of potassium for fluxing (15 - 20 - 25 K 2 O weight %). Aging experiments were carried out on the reproduced glass samples by exposure to boiling concentrated sulfuric acid and to high temperature and high pressure bi-distilled water. The glass weight loss and the alteration layer thickness were measured and the aging solutions were analyzed through AAS to detect K+ ions release. For the water attack experiments the pH of the solution was checked over time. Changes in the glass network structure {{and the presence of}} neo-formation products were determined by Raman maps recorded on altered glass cross sections and X-ray powder diffraction...|$|R
50|$|Amanita echinocephala {{occurs in}} Britain, Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. It appears in Britain during summer, and early autumn. It grows in light, dry {{calcareous}} soils with both <b>broad</b> leaved, (usually <b>beech</b> Fagus) and coniferous trees. It is quite drought-tolerant, {{giving rise to}} the suspicion that Southern England could be at the northern extent of its range. It occurs with hardwoods on calcareous soils, often associated with Limes (Tilia) in the Czech Republic, sometimes together with A. strobiliformis.|$|R
50|$|Spruce woods {{thrive in}} the highest {{locations}} from about 800 m to the tree line at around 1,000 m above sea level. These woods are also home to some deciduous trees such as rowan, silver and downy birches (Betula pendula and Betula pubescens) and willows (Salix spec.). Conditions of high humidity foster an environment rich in mosses and lichens. In spite of the near-natural habitat {{there are only a}} few, indigenous, genetically adapted (autochthone) spruce trees. Wood-reed spruce woods dominate. A well developed ground vegetation thrives on their moderately rocky and fresh, but certainly not wet, soils, characterised in appearance especially by grasses such as shaggy wood-reed (Calamagrostis villosa) and wavy hair-grass (Avenella flexuosa). The soils in the higher regions are, as in most of the Harz, comparatively poor in nutrients and bases, so that only a few herbaceous plants occur here, such as heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile). For that reason it is more the ferns, mosses, lichens and fungi that, in addition to spruce trees, characterise these woods. Boulders and stone runs occur in the areas of weather-resistant rock in the high (alti-)montane and montane zones - these are extreme habitats for vegetation. Due to the lack of soil material, only weak, straggly, very open spruce woods thrive here. They have an especially high variety of trees and allow more room of light-loving species such as silver birch, rowan, sycamore, willow and dwarf bushes such as the blueberry (Vaccinium myrtillus). Mosses and ferns are also common here. One unusual species is the Carpathian birch (Betula pubescens subsp. carpatica). Bog-spruce woods are found around the raised bogs on marshy and boggy soils. In these sorts of places spruce woods can, in exceptional cases, also form the natural woodland in lower down the mountains. These wet, moorland woods have a high proportion of peat mosses (Sphagnum spec.). The ground vegetation may also have a rich proliferation of low bushes such as cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea). Clumps of purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea) are also typical of this type of woodland habitat. The characteristic species of fungi in natural spruce woods are Phellinus viticola and prunes and custard (Tricholomopsis decora).Ravine (Schluchtwald), riparian (Auwald) and river source (Quellwald) woods only occur in small areas. In these places the common beech gives way to hardier deciduous species such as sycamore, large-leaved lime (Tilia platyphyllos), Scots elm or ash. The herbaceous layer {{is similar to that of}} the better-nourished beech woods. Notable species amongst the plant communities here include the Alpine blue-sow-thistle (Cicerbita alpina), perennial honesty (Lunaria rediviva), hard shield fern (Polystichum aculeatum) and long <b>beech</b> <b>fern</b> (Phegopteris connectilis).|$|R
40|$|Summary: Fallow deer did {{not prefer}} {{either of the}} two main canopy species (silver beech, Nothofagus menziesii, and radiata pine, Pinus radiata), or any of the common {{indigenous}} shrubs, ferns, herbs and monocotyledons in three habitat types (beech, shrub-hardwood, and exotic forest). They did prefer all the common sub canopy tree species, and these comprised the bulk of diet in all habitats. Broadleaf (Griselinia littoralis) was the most important single food, with litterfall being its dominant source. The most important non-woody foods were lichen and fungi (beech forest) and introduced grasses (exotic forest). Total forage availability did not differ between habitats (590 ± 148 kg of dry matter ha- 1), but composition did. Preferred foods (other than the introduced grasses) were scarce, particularly in the beech forest. A comparison of probable food production and use within the browse zone indicated that, at present densities, deer were not likely to prevent regeneration of the less preferred species (including silver beech). In the beech forest, regeneration of most sub canopy tree species will be minimal while deer densities remain near present levels (0. 1 deer ha- 1). However, the biomass of silver <b>beech,</b> shrubs, <b>ferns,</b> lichen, and fungi appears adequate to sustain the current deer population even if most of the preferred tree species disappear...|$|R
2500|$|The {{white spruce}} (Picea glauca) and black spruce (Picea mariana) are the {{dominant}} tree, with its maximum tree line {{being held at}} around 4,000 feet. Above this limit only stunted willows and alders are found. In the lowlands, several ferns such as the ostrich, wood, <b>beech</b> and oak <b>fern</b> are found. Beginning in late spring and continuing throughout the summer and early fall months, both adults and children gathered a variety of plants and vegetative materials. Fruit and berries (Lower Tanana jega, deneyh, nekotl Tanacross jêg, ntl'ét, nit-sįį', ... Upper Tanana [...] jjign, nt'lat, niitsil, ...), edible roots (esp. Indian potato or wild carrot Hedysarum alpinum Lower Tanana troth), and assorted plants (esp. wild rhubarb Polygonum alaskanum) were eaten fresh, preserved for later consumption, or used for medicinal purposes. Birch bark of paper birch (Lower Tanana k'iyh Tanacross and Upper Tanana k'įį) and spruce roots (Tanacross xeyh) were needed to make baskets, cooking vessels, tools, cradleboards, and canoes.|$|R
50|$|Two {{areas of}} {{woodland}} went through major thinning. Sunside Wood (2 ha) {{consisted of a}} semi-natural mixed wood of mainly ash and yew with a few scattered old oaks and small leaved lime with low stunted crowns, all growing on limestone pavement with a shaded understorey of moss, ivy and <b>ferns.</b> <b>Beech,</b> Scots pine and larch had been planted in about 1850 on the western edge. The second area, Parkland Belts (0.6 ha) consisted of similar 1850 planting of beech with a few oak, Scots pine and larch, {{all of which were}} tall closely spaced, in poor condition with spindly crowns and many were beginning to die and several had been blown over. The woodland was also open to grazing as part of the parkland area and had been used for winter feeding and dumping rubbish. The intention was to thin these woods but it was found that they had deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} a partial clear fell was needed to avoid further wind blow. As a result, 163 trees were felled with a volume of 256 cubic metres, consisting of 108 beech, 7 oak, 18 sycamore, 8 ash, 5 wych elm, 1 horse chestnut, 9 European larches, 6 Scots pines and 1 Corsican pine. The timber was sold for the sum of £6,200.|$|R
60|$|In {{spite of}} all {{professional}} misgivings {{on the part of}} the Champion and his pupil, the imperious will of the woman prevailed, and everything was carried out exactly as she had directed. At nine o'clock Tom Spring found himself upon the box-seat of the Brighton coach, and waved his hand in goodbye to burly Tom Cribb, who stood, the admired of a ring of waiters and ostlers, upon the doorstep of the Golden Cross. It was in the pleasant season when summer is mellowing into autumn, and the first golden patches are seen amid the <b>beeches</b> and the <b>ferns.</b> The young country-bred lad breathed more freely when he had left the weary streets of Southwark and Lewisham behind him, and he watched with delight the glorious prospect as the coach, whirled along by six dapple greys, passed by the classic grounds of Knowle, or after crossing Riverside Hill skirted the vast expanse of the Weald of Kent. Past Tonbridge School went the coach, and on through Southborough, until it wound down a steep, curving road with strange outcrops of sandstone beside it, and halted before a great hostelry, bearing the name which had been given him in his directions. He descended, entered the coffee-room, and ordered the underdone steak which his trainer had recommended. Hardly had he finished it when a servant with a mulberry coat and a peculiarly expressionless face entered the apartment.|$|R

40|$|American beech (Fagus grandifolia), now a {{centerpiece}} {{species of the}} eastern deciduous forest, has had a continually changing historical biogeography. This paper reviews the paleoecology, the presettlement occurrence, the modern range, and the current abundance pattern of beech. It synthesizes these four databases into maps representing the distribution and abundance of beech at specific periods from glacial maximum to the present. The post-glacial history of beech is a consistent broad northward expansion from refugia in the deep South. Beech reached its modern Canadian limits about 7, 000 years ago and flourished with remarkable dominance south of the Great Lakes (regional> 20 % pollen) until 3, 000 years ago. The contrast between presettlement (> 35 % witness trees) and modern beech abundance (< 15 % basal area) in the Northeast {{is just part of}} the regionally declining trend of beech dominance that began 2, 000 years ago. The maxima of paleoecological representation, presettlement density, and current abundance are all centered in northern Pennsylvania and align in an <b>broad</b> axis of <b>beech</b> importance reaching northeast into Canada. The beech range has sharply defined boundaries and scattered southern and western populations are usually associated with riparian zones or on sheltered mesic slopes. The new distribution map extends the modern range more than 140 km north and identifies distinct outliers not found in the former mapped range. This detailed historical and geographic baseline of beech forests before it was affected by beech bark disease forms an important quantification of range, composition, and structure of beech that should be used to assess the effects of natural, land use, and new disturbances...|$|R
