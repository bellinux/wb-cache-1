To develop the Putonghua as the official common language of the PRC is difficult sometimes because some ethnic groups that are using other dialects don't like using the Putonghua <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are losing their own native dialect and cultural identity, for example, when {{in the summer of}} 2010 appeared some reports of increasing the using of the Putonghua on a local TV broadcasting in Cantonese dialect in the province of Guangdong, then thousands of Cantonese-speaking citizens were protesting on the demonstration against the plan.|$|E

Look at them closely and you will see a feverishness and anxiety under the mask of listlessness. They do not lounge--they lie in wait. No surer sign, I imagine, of our peculiar civilization can be found than this lack of repose in its constituent elements. You cannot keep Californians quiet even in their amusements.

40|$|Abstract: Nowadays in China, {{high school}} {{assessment}} is {{based solely on}} academic examination scores, which {{take the place of}} well-rounded assessments that should be given to students. The present assessment ignores the differences among individuals and goes against a people-oriented spirit; thus, it is not scientific. This one-sided assessment has caused many negative effects on students and society, and it is not beneficial to students’ well-being. The author performed a study on a formative assessment method using a Portfolio for keeping a record of English learning while growing up to change the present situation of students being tired of study due to low scores. The assessment allows students to understand that their low scores are not <b>because</b> <b>they</b> lack a gift for learning languages, but <b>because</b> <b>they</b> themselves <b>think</b> <b>they</b> lack the ability to learn a foreign language, which leads to their unwillingness to learn English (Ames 1992; Vispoel & Austin 1995). The research examines 122 year- 11 senior middle school students’ views of the formative assessment method and their improvement in examination scores through the assessment over a period of one to two years. Qualitative and quantitative data were gathered via a questionnaire and interviews. All the data show and prove that the students who have been assessed using formative assessment enjoy going to school and have made more progress than those assessed using summative assessment. This assessment has been warmly welcomed by students, whether they are at a higher or a lower English level...|$|R

Death, who enters into no compacts with party whips, had forced a Parliamentary vacancy on the neighbourhood at the least convenient season, and the local partisans on either side found themselves immersed in the discomforts of a mid-winter election. Rupert took his politics seriously and keenly. He belonged to that type of strangely but rather happily constituted individuals which these islands seem to produce in a fair plenty; men and women who for no personal profit or gain go forth from their comfortable firesides or club card-rooms to hunt to and fro in the mud and rain and wind for the capture or tracking of a stray vote here and there on their party’s behalf—not <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> ought to, but because they want to. And his energies were welcome enough on this occasion, for the seat was a closely disputed possession, and its loss or retention would count for much in the present position of the Parliamentary game. With Kathleen to help him, he had worked his corner of the constituency with tireless, well-directed zeal, taking his share of the dull routine work as well as of the livelier episodes. The talking part of the campaign wound up on the eve of the poll with a meeting in a centre where more undecided votes were supposed to be concentrated than anywhere else in the division. A good final meeting here would mean everything. And the speakers, local and imported, left nothing undone to improve the occasion. Rupert was down for the unimportant task of moving the complimentary vote to the chairman which should close the proceedings.|$|E
60|$|You know (though I didn't, till Aristides {{explained}} to me) {{that in any}} European country the captain {{in such a case}} would go to his consul, and the consul would go to the police, and the police would run the men down and send them back to the ship in irons as deserters, or put them in jail till the captain was ready to sail, and then deliver them up to him. But it seems that there is no law in Altruria to do anything of the kind; the only law here that would touch the case is one which obliges any citizen to appear and answer the complaint of any other citizen before the Justiciary Assembly. A citizen cannot be imprisoned for anything but the rarest offence, like killing a person in a fit of passion; and as to seizing upon men who are guilty of nothing worse than wanting to be left to the pursuit of happiness, as all the Altrurians are, there is no statute and no usage for it. Aristides says that the only thing which can be done is to ask the captain and the men to come to the Assembly and each state his case. The Altrurians are not anxious to have the men stay, not merely because they are coarse, rude, or vicious, but <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> ought to go home and tell the Americans what they have seen and heard here, and try and get them to found an Altrurian Commonwealth of their own. Still they will not compel them to go, and the magistrates do not wish to rouse any sort of sentiment against them. They feel that the men are standing on their natural rights, which they could not abdicate if they would.

60|$|Why {{will not}} {{travellers}} {{be honest with}} foreign countries? Is it <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> may some day come back? For my part, I {{am going to be}} heroic, and say that the in-doors cold in England is constant suffering to the American born. It is not that there is no sizzling or crackling radiator, no tropic-breathing register; but that the grate in most of the houses that the traveler sees, the public-houses namely, seems to have shrunken to a most sordid meanness of size. In Exeter, for example, where there is such a beautiful cathedral, one found a bedroom grate of the capacity of a quart pot, and the heating capabilities of a glowworm. I might say the same of the Plymouth grate, but not quite the same of the grates of Bath or Southampton; if I pause before arriving at the grate of London, it is because daring must stop somewhere. I think it is probable that the American, if he stayed long enough, would heed the injunction to suffer and be strong from the cold, as the Englishman has so largely done, but I am not sure. At one point of my devious progress to the capital I met an Englishman who had spent ten years in Canada, and who constrained me to a mild deprecation by the wrath with which he denounced the in-doors cold he had found everywhere at home. He said that England was a hundred, five hundred, years behind in such matters; and I could not deny that, even when cowering over the quart pot to warm the hands and face, one was aware of a gelid mediaeval back behind one. To be warm all round in an English house is a thing impossible, at least to the traveller, who finds the natives living in what seems to him a whorl of draughts. In entering his own room he is apt to find the window has been put down, but this is not merely to let in some of the outside warmth; it is also to make a current of air to the open door. Even if the window has not been put down, it has always so much play in its frame, to allow for swelling from the damp, that in anything like dry weather the cold whistles round it, and you do not know which way to turn your mediaeval back.|$|E
