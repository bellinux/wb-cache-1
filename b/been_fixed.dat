5|$|Bugfix releases, which {{introduce}} no {{new features}} but fix bugs. The {{third and final}} part of the version number is incremented. These releases are made whenever {{a sufficient number of}} bugs have <b>been</b> <b>fixed</b> upstream since the last release, or roughly every 3 months. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in bugfix releases.|$|E
5|$|When Andy {{returns from}} camp, he accepts Jessie, Bullseye, and the Aliens as his new toys, {{thinking}} {{that his mother}} bought them. He then repairs Woody's torn arm while Wheezy's squeaker has also <b>been</b> <b>fixed.</b> Meanwhile, Al's business has suffered due to him failing to sell the Roundup gang. Woody tells Buzz {{that he no longer}} worried about Andy outgrowing him because, when he eventually does, they will still have each other for company.|$|E
5|$|Several {{problems}} were experienced with the iPhone 5S's hardware after its release. The most widely reported {{issue is that}} the angle reported by the phone's level sensor had drifted by several degrees, which caused the gyroscope, compass, and accelerometer to become inaccurate. Reports suggested {{that this is a}} hardware-induced problem. Some encountered other problems such as crashing with a blue screen and then restarting, the power button making a rattling noise when the phone was shaken, overheating, the microphone not working, and Touch ID not working for iTunes purchases. Some of these issues have <b>been</b> <b>fixed</b> by software updates.|$|E

5|$|Three judges testified as {{character}} witnesses: John Peter Barnes (N.D. Ill.) {{on behalf of}} Glasser, Kretske, and Roth; Charles Edgar Woodward (N.D. Ill.) on behalf of Glasser and Kretske; and state judge John F. Haas on behalf of Kretske. Kaplan and Horton both took the stand, denying that they ever paid money to Glasser or Kretske. Two defense attorneys, Henry Balaban and Edward J. Hess (who was representing Kaplan at the trial), who had also defended clients in cases the government's case-in-chief had alleged to be fixed, denying paying bribes to Glasser or Kretske (although the government had not accused them of this). Glasser's testimony took three hours, as he was cross-examined individually about every single case {{that the government had}} alleged to have <b>been</b> <b>fixed.</b>|$|E
5|$|E.P. Arnold Royalton, {{owner of}} {{conglomerate}} Royalton Industries, offers Speed an astoundingly luxurious lifestyle {{in exchange for}} signing to race with him. Speed is tempted but declines due to his father's distrust of power-hungry corporations. Angered, Royalton reveals that for many years the key races have <b>been</b> <b>fixed</b> by corporate interests, including Royalton himself, to gain profits. Royalton takes out his anger on Speed by having his drivers force Speed into a crash that destroys the Mach 6 and suing Racer Motors for intellectual property infringement. Speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through Inspector Detector, head of a corporate crimes division. Racer Taejo Togokahn {{says that he has}} evidence that could indict Royalton but will only offer it up if Speed and the mysterious masked Racer X agree to race on his team in the Casa Cristo 5000. Taejo says that a win could substantially raise the stock price of his family's racing business, blocking a Royalton-arranged buyout. Speed agrees but keeps his decision secret from his family, and Inspector Detector's team makes several defensive modifications to the Mach 5 to assist Speed in the rally.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Ruth hit 54 {{home runs}} {{for a new}} record; his total was {{higher than that of}} all other MLB teams but the Philadelphia Phillies. New York had 95 wins, the most in team history to that point, but fell three wins short of the AL {{championship}} and finished third. In an August 16 game against the Indians, a pitch from Mays hit Indians shortstop Ray Chapman in the head, leading to his death; the Yankees slumped after the incident as Cleveland captured the pennant. After the season, the Yankees hired general manager Ed Barrow from the Red Sox. Barrow made numerous trades with his former club, including one immediately after his departure that brought catcher Wally Schang and pitcher Waite Hoyt to New York. The Yankees also became involved in another dispute with Ban Johnson, this time over the replacement of baseball's existing governing body, the National Commission, after reports came out that the 1919 World Series had <b>been</b> <b>fixed.</b> The Yankees and 10 other franchises—including the entire NL—supported the idea of a three-man committee drawn from outside baseball running MLB, and for a time a move by the Yankees to the NL was rumored; ultimately, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis was named MLB's first commissioner.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that a small but {{significant}} loss in length occurs in human muscles which <b>are</b> <b>fixed</b> after removal from the skeleton. A comparison was made between the loss in muscle length when muscles <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> in isolation from, and whilst still attached to, the skeleton in the rat. The conclusion was that no significant loss of length occurs when the muscles <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> intact on the skeleton. Since the length loss when muscles <b>are</b> <b>fixed</b> independently of the skeleton in both the rat and the human is of the same order, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that when human muscles <b>are</b> <b>fixed</b> on the skeleton, no significant loss in length occurs. Since all human cadaveric tissue <b>is</b> <b>fixed</b> whilst on the skeleton, we may assume that shrinkage of the muscles in such specimens is negligible...|$|R
