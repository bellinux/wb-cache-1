5|$|Louis invaded Wallachia in May 1375, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> {{prince of}} Wallachia, Radu I, had formed an {{alliance}} with the Bulgarian ruler, Ivan Shishman, and the Ottoman Sultan Murad I. The Hungarian army routed the united forces of the Wallachians and their allies, and Louis occupied the Banate of Severin, but Radu I did not yield. During the summer, Wallachian troops stormed into Transylvania and Ottomans pillaged the Banat.|$|E
5|$|The Conservatives {{remained}} in office <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> electoral register {{was not yet}} ready; neither party wished a poll under the old roll. Gladstone began using the Liberal majority in the House of Commons to push through resolutions and legislation. Disraeli's government survived until the December general election, at which the Liberals were returned to power with a majority of about 110.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> game is set {{within a}} {{well-established}} franchise, Starbreeze tried {{to retain the}} essence of the world and rebuild these elements. The game's story was written by British science-fiction writer Richard K Morgan, whom the team approached after they read his book Altered Carbon. Syndicate was Morgan's second video-game script after 2011's Crysis 2; he used the original game for reference and included elements that those who had played it would immediately recognize. He preserved the original's dystopian setting and theme, and hoped to use these elements to build a powerful story. Morgan traveled to Sweden to meet Starbreeze's game designers to ensure the game's story would not contradict its overall design.|$|E

50|$|The {{tracks were}} rehabilitated again in 2007. This project was {{undertaken}} <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>newest</b> LRV's, low floor handicapped accessible models from Breda, did not operate reliably over the tracks at the desired 40 to 50 {{mile per hour}} speeds. While the Riverside line generally received <b>the</b> <b>newest</b> cars first, {{it was the last}} to get the Breda cars due to the need to upgrade the tracks.|$|R
5|$|In May 1707, Governor Dudley {{organized}} {{an expedition}} to take Port Royal led by John March. However, 1,600 men failed to take the fort by siege, and a follow-up expedition in August was also repulsed. In response, the French developed an ambitious plan to raid most of the New Hampshire settlements on the Piscataqua River. However, much of the Indian support needed never materialized, and the Massachusetts town of Haverhill was raided instead. In 1709, New France governor Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil reported {{that two-thirds of the}} fields north of Boston were untended because of French and Indian raids. French-Indian war parties were returning without prisoners <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> England colonists stayed in their forts and would not come out.|$|E
5|$|In late 1984, geologists {{noticed that}} seismic {{activity}} in the area had begun to increase. Increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and phreatic eruptions also alerted geologists to the possibility of an eruption. Phreatic events, when rising magma encounters water, continued well into September 1985 (one major event took place on September 11, 1985), shooting steam high into the air. Activity began to decline in October, probably <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> magma had finished ascending into Nevado del Ruiz's volcanic edifice.|$|E
5|$|John VI died in Lisbon in 1826. His elder son Peter, who had {{declared}} {{the independence of}} Brazil in 1822, becoming Emperor Peter I, succeeded to the Portuguese throne as Peter IV. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Brazilian constitution did not allow further personal unions of Portugal and Brazil, Peter abdicated the Portuguese crown in favour of his elder daughter Maria da Glória, who became Maria II of Portugal. She was only seven years old, so Peter stated she would marry his brother Miguel who would act as regent. However, in 1828, Miguel deposed Maria and proclaimed himself king, abolishing the 1822 liberal constitution and ruling as an absolute monarch. This started {{the period of the}} Liberal Wars.|$|E

50|$|On Saturday, 4 November 1989, InterCity {{implemented}} a new timetable. It {{had been planned}} for the Bay Express {{to have been in}} service by this date, but <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> cars were still being rebuilt and both Palmerston North and Napier refreshment rooms closed on the same date, the former NIMT car turned Southerner later Kiwi Lager Express buffet car was added to the Endeavour consist in the interim.|$|R
5|$|Louis {{assembled}} his armies in Temesvár (now Timișoara in Romania) in February 1365. According a royal charter that year, he {{was planning}} to invade Wallachia <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> voivode, Vladislav Vlaicu, had refused to obey him. However, he ended up heading a campaign against the Bulgarian Tsardom of Vidin and its ruler Ivan Sratsimir, which suggests that Vladislav Vlaicu had in the meantime yielded to him. Louis seized Vidin and imprisoned Ivan Stratsimir in May or June. Within three months, his troops occupied Ivan Stratsimir's realm, which was organized into a separate border province, or banate, under the command of Hungarian lords.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a {{crossing}} {{arose in}} the 1960s; and until the 1990s proposals were for a pontoon bridge further north. The Stord Bridge was conceived after the decision to combine the crossing with the Bømlafjord Tunnel. The project was resisted both by local environmental groups and the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, the latter <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> plans would delay completion. Construction was undertaken by a joint venue between NCC and HBG Steel Structures. Construction started in 1999 {{and was the first}} bridge in Norway to have the cables spun on-site. The bridge cost 442 million Norwegian krone (NOK) and was taken into use on 27 December 2000.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 {{attacks on}} Christians in {{southern}} Karnataka {{refer to the}} wave of attacks directed against Christian churches and prayer halls in the Indian city of Mangalore {{and the surrounding area}} of southern Karnataka in September and October 2008 by Hindu extremist organisations, Bajrang Dal and the Sri Ram Sena. The attacks were widely perceived by Christians in southern Karnataka to be punishment from right-wing Hindu nationalist organisations because they had been outspoken about Christian persecution in Orissa, after the assassination of Hindu monk Swami Lakshmanananda Saraswati allegedly by local christian community and also <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Life Fellowship Trust (NLFT), a non-denominational Christian Church, was alleged by Bajrang Dal to be responsible for forced conversions of Hindus to Christianity.|$|E

5|$|Atari created prototypes for {{location}} testing, but {{the game}} did not fare well against more popular titles at the time such as Street Fighter II. Atari assumed the track balls accounted for the poor reception and commissioned a second model with joystick controls. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> models were met with the same poor reception, production was halted and the focus shifted to Guardians of the 'Hood, a beat 'em up game. An urban legend states that when WMS Industries purchased Time Warner Interactive (the company which Atari Games had since merged into) in 1996, they ran a steamroller over the Marble Madness II boards in order to clear inventory for tax purposes. In actuality, no Marble Madness II boards were made apart from the prototypes, and according to Cerny at most 12 of these exist. These prototypes have since become collector items.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Olimpija is {{supported}} {{by most of the}} fans of the previous Olimpija, including their ultras group, the Green Dragons, who have a long-standing rivalry with Maribor's own ultras group Viole Maribor, many see the matches between Maribor and the new club as the continuation of the rivalry and refer to it by the same name. However, there are many fans, either the ones from Maribor or the ones from Ljubljana, that do not share the same view and do not share similar beliefs, including part of the media such as RTV Slovenija and Večer. The overall statistics of {{the old and the new}} Olimpija are tracked separately by the Football Association of Slovenia and the Association of 1. SNL. The first match between Maribor and the new Olimpija took place on 24 October 2007 in a Slovenian cup quarter-final match that was won by Maribor, 3–1. At the time, Olimpija was still competing under the name Olimpija Bežigrad. Statistically, Maribor is the more successful club either in the case of matches from the period from 1962 to 2005 or the whole period from 1962 to present day.|$|E
5|$|However, some job {{still had}} to be found for Chotiner, who had wound up his California {{practice}} and sold his home. Haldeman refused to have him in the White House, and Nixon's aides deemed that the Democratic-controlled Senate was unlikely to confirm Chotiner for any post requiring its approval. On April 10, 1969, acting Special Representative for Trade Negotiations Theodore R. Gates appointed Chotiner as General Counsel to his office, as almost simultaneously, the White House announced Gates' replacement, Carl J. Gilbert. On April 1, Nixon had issued Executive Order 11463, making the position of general counsel in that office a Schedule C, or political appointment, and significantly raising the salary of the position. Nixon press secretary Ron Ziegler stated that the salary had been raised <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> incumbent was expected to play {{a more active role}} than had previous holders of the position.|$|E
50|$|At the moment, any {{version of}} Jokosher needs either {{the latest version}} of GStreamer and Gnonlin installed, or a Concurrent Versions System (CVS) {{checkout}} of GStreamer and Gnonlin compiled.

The control booths used for American Portrait were relocated {{to the side of}} the midway. On May 2, 2012 it was announced that WildCat would be removed before opening day to expand Celebration Plaza and bleachers were added in its spot. A new concession area with patio seating was built on the left side of the control booth. During the show, a portion of the patio is blocked off as a V.I.P. seating area known as the Pepsi Fan Zone. In addition, a beer garden was added behind the control booth, to the left of the bleachers.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{advocated}} quick {{recognition of}} Croatia, stating that {{it wanted to}} stop ongoing violence in Serb-inhabited areas. It was opposed by France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, but the countries agreed to pursue a common approach and avoid unilateral actions. On 10 October, {{two days after the}} Croatian Parliament confirmed the declaration of independence, the EEC decided to postpone any decision to recognize Croatia for two months, deciding to recognize Croatian independence in two months if the war had not ended by then. As the deadline expired, Germany presented its decision to recognize Croatia as its policy and dutya position supported by Italy and Denmark. France and the UK attempted to prevent the recognition by drafting a United Nations resolution requesting no unilateral actions which could worsen the situation, but backed down during the Security Council debate on 14 December, when Germany appeared determined to defy the UN resolution. On 17 December, the EEC formally agreed to grant Croatia diplomatic recognition on 15 January 1992, relying on opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Committee. The Committee ruled that Croatia's independence should not be recognized immediately, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Croatian Constitution did not provide protection of minorities required by the EEC. In response, the President Franjo Tuđman gave written assurances to Robert Badinter that the deficit would be remedied. The RSK formally declared its separation from Croatia on 19 December, but its statehood and independence were not recognized internationally. On 26 December, Yugoslav authorities announced plans for a smaller state, which could include the territory captured from Croatia, but the plan was rejected by the UN General Assembly.|$|E
