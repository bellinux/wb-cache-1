25|$|China Post {{reported}} that some polls {{have indicated that}} the public may <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> Chen's visit, with about 50% of the Taiwanese public considered Chen's visit having {{a positive effect on}} Taiwan's development, while 18 to 26% of the respondents thought the effect would be negative. In another poll, it suggested that 26% of the respondents were satisfied with the DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen's handling of the crowds in the series of protests, while 53% of the respondents were unsatisfied.

25|$|Consistently {{with its}} silence before the election, the PRC {{government}} refrained from commenting {{directly on the}} election results, and PRC media, which follows instructions on reporting from the government, has been very quiet as to {{the result of the}} elections. Also consistently with its behaviour before the election, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China commented on the failure of the two United Nations-related referenda held concurrently with the election, stating that the results showed the lack of popular support for independence in Taiwan. The Bureau also expressed optimism for the two governments to work together to maintain cross-strait peace and aid development in future. It is speculated that the mainland government would <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> the result.|$|E
25|$|The Australian captain Ricky Ponting {{brought on}} {{part-time}} spinner Michael Clarke to bowl the 11th over, and got immediate success, when Pietersen launched him to Matthew Hayden {{on the fifth}} ball, but England were still 101 for 3 after 11 overs. In the next over, the new batsman Michael Vaughan edged Andrew Symonds' ball to midwicket, and the pressure was suddenly on the English. With Trescothick out for 41 a bit later to an attempted sweep off Symonds, England were suddenly looking down a hole after a fine start, and Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood slowed the scoring, to see England 111 for 5 with six overs to play. However, a slog sweep from Collingwood to end the 15th over turned the match again, as it went away for six and England moved to 124 for 5. With Jason Gillespie being brought back, Collingwood led the charge, as England stole 17 runs off the 17th over and wrought control of the game again. Despite Andrew Strauss being bowled by Gillespie for 18, Collingwood hit another two boundaries {{towards the end of}} the over, to move onto 42 not out and the team score to 167 for 6. Vikram Solanki was out in the next over for 9, caught by Hussey off McGrath, and on the last ball, Collingwood was caught by for 46. Still, England would <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> 179 for 8, the highest score on the Rose Bowl in Twenty20 matches.|$|E
25|$|Cicero {{understood}} {{what was going}} on and got Lucius Ninnius Quadratus, a plebeian tribune, to oppose every move of Clodius. The latter, fearing that this could result in disturbances and delays outwitted them by deceit. He agreed with Cicero not to bring an indictment against him. However, when these two men lowered their guard, Clodius proposed a bill to outlaw those who would or had executed any citizen without trial. This brought within its scope the whole of the senate, which had decreed the executions during the Catilinarian conspiracy of 63 BC (see above). However, it was actually targeting Cicero, who had received most of the blame because he had proposed the motion and had ordered the executions. Cicero strenuously opposed the bill. He also sought the support of Pompey and Caesar. These two men did not want to appear to have instigated Clodius or to <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> his motion. Caesar advised Cicero to leave Rome because his life was in danger and offered him to become one of his lieutenants in Gaul so that his departure would not be dishonourable. Pompey advised him that to leave would be an act of desertion and that he should remain in Rome, defend himself and challenge Clodius, who would not achieve anything if he did so because he would help him. He also said that Caesar was giving him bad advice out of enmity. Pompey and Caesar presented opposite views on purpose to deceive Cicero and not give rise to suspicions. Cicero attached himself to Pompey. He also thought that he could count on the consuls. Aulus Gabinius was a friend of his and Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus was amiable and a kin of Caesar.|$|E

500|$|Criteria for {{the success}} of the implant {{supported}} dental prosthetic varies from study to study, but can be broadly classified into failures due to the implant, soft tissues or prosthetic components or a lack of satisfaction {{on the part of the}} patient. The most commonly cited criteria for success are function of at least five years in the absence of pain, mobility, radiographic lucency and [...] peri-implant bone loss of greater than 1.5mm [...] on the implant, the lack of suppuration or bleeding in the soft tissues and occurrence of technical complications/prosthetic maintenance, adequate function, and esthetics in the prosthetic. In addition, the patient should ideally be free of pain, paraesthesia, able to chew and taste and <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> the esthetics.|$|E
500|$|Chicago's bid was {{supported}} by major preliminary corporate commitments, philanthropic efforts by wealthy Chicagoans, promised planning participation by {{a wide range of}} community and government leaders, and the enthusiasm of the citizenry. Local support for the bid on the South Side, particularly in the Washington Park and Woodlawn community areas, was divided. Ben Joravsky, a Chicago Reader columnist, was one of the strongest critics of the Chicago 2016 bid. However, 2007 opinion polls indicated 76 percent public support. [...] In 2009, as the final selection approached, opponents of the bid became vocal even though organizers seemed to <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> the bid's progress and presentation.

Rodman, chair of the USC School of Cinematic Arts Writing Division, described the book-to-screen adaptation as [...] "writing and screen writing of the highest order", although Gerschatt, writing in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, noted that the screenplay bore very {{little resemblance to the}} novel: the gender of the baby was changed, as was the character who was pregnant (Julian, in the novel); Theo, who dies in the film, did not die in the novel. [...] The film was also nominated in the category of Best Adapted Screenplay at the 79th Academy Awards.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} game's {{graphical}} quality. Gerstmann said {{the use of}} lighting added a unique style to the game. He also liked the depiction {{of the two major}} areas of the game, and the game's sounds, which he said suited the tone of the game. Alexandra Hall from GamesRadar said [...] "Starbreeze really coaxed some beautiful sights out of aging hardware". She added that some players may not <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> the game's bloom effects. David Houghton of the same publication said the game is [...] "a decent shooter" [...] but that its lightbloom effects were [...] "nonsensically over-the-top". Peter Eykemans from IGN echoed similar thoughts, declaring that the motion bloom and blinding light a problem. However, he admitted that the game [...] "constantly looks great", and that its simple design has made the game to look very polished.|$|E
500|$|Dungeon Keeper 2 was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows by Electronic Arts in late June 1999.

Indeed, Molyneux stated that he [...] "liked what they did with it", but also {{said that it was}} not precisely what he would have done and that his focus would have been [...] "expanding that sense of creating the greatest dungeon". A PlayStation version was in development, but cancelled. The first patch, which added levels, fixed bugs, and tweaked gameplay, {{was released}} in August. Ideas such as the merging of the underworld and overworld were planned for Dungeon Keeper 3, but Electronic Arts began focusing on other franchises such as Harry Potter. In August 2000, Bullfrog announced that the development of Dungeon Keeper 3 had been cancelled. Dungeon Keeper 2 is available on gog.com and Origin.|$|E

500|$|The {{memory of}} her father {{apparently}} motivated Maria Amélia's dedication to her education. The late Duke of Braganza cast a large shadow in her life, and was always remembered by his daughter, who would often ask the people around her: [...] "and my father, who looks at me from heaven, shall he <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> his daughter?" [...] She was never quite {{able to cope with}} her father's death and it deeply touched her. Maria Amélia remarked after she saw a garden where Pedro planted a sycamore: [...] "A profound sadness invaded me when contemplating these trees, which had survived my father and probably shall survive all of us. It is an image of human fragility. Man is the most frail of all beings; he dies, while the objects which were seemingly created for his use, endure the centuries!... But I am digressing in my melancholic reflections".|$|E

The man they seek will flee and will be found between the Rukn (a corner of the Kaaba containing the Black Stone) and the Maqam of Prophet Abraham (near Ka'ba). He will be forced to accept people's Bay'ah (being chosen as a Leader/Caliph). The number of those offering Bay'ah will be the same as the number of the people of Badr (Muslim fighters who participated in the Battle of Badr at time of Prophet Muhammad). Then, the dweller of [...] Heaven and the dweller of the Earth will <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> him.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were critical. Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examinations, wrote a rather {{positive}} review of the episode. He noted that, while the episode [...] "told us nothing of significance" [...] regarding the [...] "big picture" [...] mythology story arc, {{the chance to see}} Mulder and Scully together one last time resulted in [...] "an exquisite Mulder-Scully moment". He was particularly pleased with the final scene, noting that it was an appropriate conclusion; he called it [...] "fitting", as well as [...] "wonderful". Kessenich maintained that, {{were it not for the}} return of Duchovny, [...] "nobody would have given a damn about the end of this series." [...] Julie Salamon of The New York Times gave the episode a positive review. Salamon noted that [...] "Until the end, the series maintained its mesmerizing visual gloominess, cleverly punctuated with suggestive plays of color and light". She claimed the show [...] "also retained its conspiracy-theory heart that has appealed so greatly to viewers". John C. Snider of SciFiDimensions praised the episode, stating [...] "The Truth is a satisfying conclusion to the series, with plenty of twists and turns, a few surprise guest appearances, and an explosive finale complete with requisite black helicopters. The romantics among us will also <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> the culmination of the Mulder/Scully relationship".|$|E

500|$|Several {{critical}} reviews {{cited the}} stop motion animation {{as one of}} the film's only redeeming qualities. Richard Meyers, a novelist who also wrote about science-fiction films, described Laserblast as [...] "basically repetitive and predictable", but included some redemptive qualities in the animation of Dave Allen and the makeup effects of Steve Neill. Science fiction literary scholar Peter Nicholls called it the worst of Charles Band's films, calling it [...] "badly scripted, badly paced rubbish," [...] describing Allen's [...] "o.k. aliens" [...] as [...] "the only plus". Likewise, film essayist Dennis Fischer said Allen's stop motion animation provides the film's [...] "sole moments of interest", and Cinefex publisher Don Shay called it the film's [...] "only viable selling points". In their DVD & Video Guide, Mick Martin and Marsha Porter called it a [...] "dreadful low-budget film with some excellent special effects by David Allen". Doug Pratt, who criticized the poor acting and dull dialogue, said the special effects and stop motion animation [...] "are well executed, but the sequences without effects are fairly dumb". The authors of The DVD-Laser Disc Newsletter called the film [...] "a dull and padded revenge-against-bullies tale", but said the stop motion animation were enjoyable enough that [...] "fans are likely to <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> the low-budget film's positive attributes and willing to ignore the rest".|$|E
