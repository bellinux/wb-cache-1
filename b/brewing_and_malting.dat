5|$|Stephen Hartley began brewing in Tadcaster in 1758. In 1845 Jane Hartley mortgaged {{the brewery}} to David Backhouse and John Hartley. In 1847, Samuel Smith of Leeds {{arranged}} {{for his son}} John to enter the business. Jane Hartley died in 1852, and John Smith acquired the business, enlisting his brother William to help him. The timing was to prove fortuitous; pale ales were displacing porter as the beer of choice, and Tadcaster's hard water proved to be well-suited for brewing the new style. The prosperity of the 1850s and 1860s, together {{with the arrival of}} the railways, realised greater opportunities for brewers, and by 1861 John Smith employed eight men in his <b>brewing</b> <b>and</b> <b>malting</b> enterprise.|$|E
5|$|The O'Brien <b>Brewing</b> <b>and</b> <b>Malting</b> Company, {{also known}} as the Klondike Brewery, was a brewery founded by Thomas O'Brien in Klondike City, an {{adjoining}} settlement to Dawson City, Yukon Territory, Canada from 1904 to 1919. It was established during a period in which Dawson City was expected to become an important regional city, and used modern techniques and equipment imported from California. It was initially successful, selling 68,748 gallons of beer in 1905, but Dawson's population declined and growing temperance attitudes threatened the business. O'Brien sold the company in 1915, and in 1919 prohibition forced its closure. The brewery was abandoned, and the remains of the site are now owned by the Tr'ondek Hwech'in First Nation.|$|E
5|$|The legal {{paperwork}} for the O'Brien <b>Brewing</b> <b>and</b> <b>Malting</b> Company {{was completed}} in late 1903 and the company was formally created in February 1904 by O'Brien as the majority shareholder with 77 percent of the stock, and six other investors. The company had an initial capital of $200,000 and owned $53,000 of land in Klondike City, just {{across the river from}} Dawson, which O'Brien had sold to the new company. George Mero was employed to build the new brewery at considerable speed - 15 days were allowed for the work's completion - converting O'Brien's old building for its new use. The brewery was situated alongside the Klondike Mines Railway terminal, also owned by O'Brien. It opened for business in April.|$|E

25|$|Natural gas service {{began in}} Calgary {{somewhat}} later, when A.W. Dingman formed the Calgary Natural Gas Company. He drilled a successful well in east Calgary, laid pipe to the Calgary <b>Brewing</b> <b>and</b> <b>Malting</b> Company site and began providing gas to the brewery on April 10, 1910. As in Medicine Hat, gas mains soon provided domestic fuel and street lighting.|$|E

2500|$|The River Lea {{flows through}} the old <b>brewing</b> <b>and</b> <b>malting</b> centre of Ware, and {{consequently}} transport by water was for many years a significant industry based there. Barley was transported into Ware, and malt out via the river, in particular to London. Bargemen born in Ware were given the [...] "freedom of the River Thames" [...] — avoiding the requirement of paying lock dues — {{as a result of}} their transport of fresh water and food to London during The Great Plague of 1665–66. A local legend says that dead bodies were brought out of London at that time via the river for burying in Ware, but there is no evidence for this.|$|E

No form of the word was ever in use again before the 1500s, where beer was renamed following its import from German, bier, and thereafter the word began to describe a grain based alcohol of barley or wheat, sometimes <b>brewed</b> with hops <b>and</b> <b>malt.</b>|$|R
5|$|Worthington's Creamflow (3.6% ABV) is {{the twelfth}} highest selling {{beer in the}} United Kingdom, with an {{estimated}} 640,000 hectolitres sold in 2012.

It is the highest selling ale in Wales, where it has a 20 per cent volume share, and has held pole position since at least 1999. Most of the sales consist of the nitrogenated and pasteurised Creamflow, which was launched in 1995 and is available in kegs and cans.

40|$|To {{increase}} <b>brewing</b> yield <b>and</b> efficiency, <b>malts</b> {{with high}} extract values, high enzymic activities and good modification are essential. To produce malt that meets these requirements, the barley employed must have minimal post-harvest dormancy {{and be able}} to germinate vigorously. The aims of this study were {{to determine the extent to}} which some Australian barley varieties changed during post-harvest storage, how these changes influenced germination characteristics, enzyme production <b>and</b> <b>malt</b> quality, <b>and,</b> of the germination tests examined, which gave the best indication of a barley&# 039;s malting potential. Four commercially grown barley samples were obtained, one from Tasmania and three from Victoria. Each sample was stored at room temperature for one year. At monthly intervals, samples were taken and placed at - 18 degrees C. The germinative energy (GE) and germinative index (GI) of these samples were measured. Samples were also micro-malted and the quality of the malt was assessed using standard EBC methodology. Storage at room temperature positively influenced the germination characteristics of all samples, with concomitant improvements in hydrolytic enzyme production during <b>malting</b> <b>and</b> in a number of malt quality parameters. It was found that, of the germination tests examined, the GI consistently correlated with enzyme activities during <b>malting</b> <b>and</b> with various <b>malt</b> quality parameters thus indicating that the GI is a good indicator of malting potential...|$|R
