50|$|Bill Tilden, the {{dominant}} {{player of the}} 1920s, preferred to play {{from the back of}} the court, and liked nothing better than to face an opponent who rushed the net — one way or another Tilden would find a way to hit the ball past him. In his <b>book</b> <b>Match</b> Play and the Spin of the Ball, Tilden propounds the theory that by definition a great baseline player will always beat a great serve-and-volleyer. Some of the best matches of all time have pitted great baseliners such as Björn Borg, Mats Wilander or Andre Agassi against great serve-and-volleyers such as John McEnroe, Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, or Pete Sampras.|$|E
50|$|Bill Tilden, the {{dominant}} {{player of the}} 1920s {{and one of the}} fathers of the cannonball serve, nevertheless preferred to play from the backcourt and liked nothing better than to face an opponent who threw powerful serves and ground strokes at him and who rushed the net — one way or another Tilden {{would find a way to}} hit the ball past him. Tilden may also have spent more time analyzing the game of tennis than anyone before or since. His <b>book</b> <b>Match</b> Play and the Spin of the Ball (1925) is still in print and is the definitive work on the subject. In it, Tilden states that a perfect baseline player will always beat a perfect serve-and-volleyer 6-0 because his returns of service will be winning passing shots; however he also states that of course neither such a player can exist. Tilden used this style of play for many years.|$|E

50|$|It {{was also}} show {{business}} that led Self {{to become an}} accomplished tennis player. In 1932, age eleven, his parents took him to New York to see a Broadway production of Show Boat. Self's father pointed out tennis champion Bill Tilden in the lobby, telling him that Tilden was the greatest living tennis player. Self did not know anything about tennis, but he was impressed. He asked Tilden to sign his program. Back in Dayton, Self bought Tilden's <b>book,</b> <b>Match</b> Play and the Spin of the Ball, and talked his parents into purchasing him a tennis racket. With time, he would become runner-up in the Wisconsin Junior Tennis Championship, represent Wisconsin on the Junior Davis Cup team and, in 1945, win The Wisconsin State Men's Championship. Self played Varsity tennis at the University of Chicago and in his Senior Year was elected Captain of the team. When he came to Los Angeles in 1944, as an unknown and untried actor, his skill at tennis allowed him to make important contacts. He regularly played with Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn, Charlie Chaplin, and Jack L. Warner, among other Hollywood notables. He also became friends with and played Bill Tilden.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether people would interpret {{and respond to}} paralinguistic personality cues in computer-generated speech {{in the same way}} as they do human speech. Participants used a book-buying website and heard five book reviews in a 2 (synthesized voice personality: extrovert vs. introvert) by 2 (participant personality: extrovert vs. introvert) balanced, between-subjects experiment. Participants accurately recognized personality cues in TTS and showed strong similarity-attraction effects. Although the content was the same for all participants, when the personality of the computer voice matched their own personality: 1) participants regarded the computer voice as more attractive, credible, and informative; 2) the book review was evaluated more positively; 3) the reviewer was more attractive and credible; and 4) participants were more likely to buy the <b>book.</b> <b>Match</b> of user voice characteristics with TTS had no effect, confirming the social nature of the interaction.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{entitled}} The Portrayal of Individual Differences in A Picture Book “Cleo and Cloe’s Colourful Day”:A Verbal and Visual Analysis investigates the verbal and visual portrayal {{of individual differences}} in the picture book revealed in the twin sisters. The study empoys a descriptive qualitative method to describe and interpret the data. Some theoretical frameworks were applied in this present study. In terms of verbal analyisis, transitivity proposed by Halliday (2002) was applied and for visual analysis, this study employed Kress and van Leuween’s (2006) visual grammar as well as Joyce and Gaudin’s (2011) picture book’s analysis. Furthermore, the last theoretical framework is individual differences characteristics from Jimoh and Olawuyi (2008). The analysis of verbal texts demonstrate that individual differences of the twin sisters in the picture book are mostly presented through material process. It implies that the author wants to show the twin sisters’s individual differences from the activity they choose and how they do that. Meanwhile, all visual elements covered in three metafunctions (representational, interpretational and compositional metafunction) {{also play a role}} in revealing the individual differences of the twin sisters in the picture book. The findings indicate that both verbal and visual elements in the picture <b>book</b> <b>match</b> each other in portraying the individual differences...|$|E
