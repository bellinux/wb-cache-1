5|$|A {{subtropical}} cyclone is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form between the equator and the 50th parallel. As early as the 1950s, meteorologists were unclear whether they should <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> tropical cyclones or extratropical cyclones, and used terms such as quasi-tropical and semi-tropical to describe the cyclone hybrids. By 1972, the National Hurricane Center officially recognized this cyclone category. Subtropical cyclones began to receive names off the official tropical cyclone list in the Atlantic Basin in 2002. They have broad wind patterns with maximum sustained winds located farther from the center than typical tropical cyclones, and exist in areas of weak to moderate temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{disbanding}} of the Iraqi Army, insurgent activity increased, {{especially in}} Fallujah. Initially, armed resistance groups could <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> either Sunni nationalists {{who wanted to}} bring back the Ba'ath Party with Saddam Hussein, or anti-Saddam fighters. The first major leader of the insurgency in Anbar was Khamis Sirhan al-Muhammad, the Ba'ath party regional chairman for the Karbala Governorate, who was originally No. 54 on the US list of most-wanted Iraqis. According to the US military, Khamis received his funding and orders directly from Saddam, then still a fugitive.|$|E

50|$|Patients {{may require}} episodic blood transfusions. Transfusion-dependent {{patients}} develop iron overload and require chelation therapy {{to remove the}} excess iron. Transmission is autosomal recessive; however, dominant mutations and compound heterozygotes have been reported. Genetic counseling is recommended and prenatal diagnosis may be offered. Alleles without a mutation that reduces function <b>are</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> (β).Mutations <b>are</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> (βo) if they prevent any formation of β chains,mutations <b>are</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> (β+) if they allow some β chain formation to occur.|$|R
40|$|By {{antigenic}} {{and genetic}} characterization of canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV- 2) strains collected in 2001 and 2002 in Italy, {{it was possible}} to observe the spread of viruses with an unusual mutation, Glu- 426, affecting a major antigenic epitope of CPV- 2. Out of 67 strains analyzed, 49 (73. 13 %) <b>were</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> CPV- 2 a, 6 (8. 95 %) <b>were</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> CPV- 2 b, and 12 (17. 91 %) <b>were</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> the Glu- 426 mutant...|$|R
5|$|In a {{volcanic}} eruption, lava, tephra (volcanic bombs, lapilli, and ash), and various gases are expelled from {{a volcanic}} vent or fissure. While many eruptions only pose dangers to the immediately surrounding area, Earth's largest eruptions {{can have a}} major regional or even global impact, with some affecting the climate and contributing to mass extinctions. Volcanic eruptions can generally <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> either explosive eruptions, sudden ejections of rock and ash, or effusive eruptions, relatively gentle outpourings of lava. A separate list is given below for each type.|$|E
5|$|Some critics, {{including}} Murray Rothbard, {{have sought}} to show that Keynes had sympathy with Nazism, {{and a number of}} writers described him as antisemitic. Keynes's private letters contain portraits and descriptions, some of which can <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> antisemitic, others as philosemitic. Scholars have suggested that these reflect clichés current {{at the time that he}} accepted uncritically, rather than any racism. On several occasions Keynes used his influence to help his Jewish friends, most notably when he successfully lobbied for Ludwig Wittgenstein to be allowed residency in the United Kingdom, explicitly in order to rescue him from being deported to Nazi-occupied Austria. Keynes was a supporter of Zionism, serving on committees supporting the cause.|$|E
5|$|Two {{conflicting}} views {{exist as}} to whether the war was a civil or an international war. The prevailing view in Serbia is that there were two civil wars in the area: one between Croats and Serbs living in Croatia, and another between SFR Yugoslavia and Croatia, a part of the federation. The prevailing view in Croatia and of most international law experts, including both international courts ICTY and ICJ, is that the war was an international conflict, a war of aggression waged by the rump Yugoslavia and Serbia against Croatia, supported by Serbs in Croatia.The armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia started shortly after the date on which Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence on June 25, 1991 between the military forces of the SFRY and Slovenia and Croatia. Such armed conflict should of course <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> internal because the declarations of independence were suspended in consequence of the proposal of the EC for three months. After the expiration of the three months' period, on October 7, 1991, Slovenia proclaimed its independence with effect from that date, and Croatia with effect from October 8, 1991. So the armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia should be considered international as from October 8, 1991 because the independence of these two States was definite on that date}} Neither Croatia nor Yugoslavia ever formally declared war on each other. Unlike the Serbian position that the conflict need not be declared as it was a civil war, the Croatian motivation for not declaring war was that Tuđman believed that Croatia could not confront the JNA directly and did everything to avoid an all-out war.|$|E
