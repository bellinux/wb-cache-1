Here, we evaluated the treatment effects of SS-BM and G-BM/G-PBSC in human leucocyte antigen (HLA) -identical sibling transplantation. Methods: A total of 226 patients (acute myelogenous leukemia-complete remission 1, chronic myelogenous leukemia-chronic phase 1) received SS-BM, G-BM, or G-PBSC from an HLA-identical sibling. Clinical outcomes (graft-versus-host disease [GVHD], overall survival, transplant-related mortality [TRM], and leukemia-free survival [LFS]) were analyzed. Results: When compared to SS-BM, G-BM gave faster recovery time to neutrophil or platelet (P 0. 05). Conclusions: G-CSF-primed bone marrow shared the advantages of G-PBSC and SS-BM.

40|$|Abstract Introduction We {{report a}} case of {{sinusoidal}} obstruction syndrome, a typical and life-threatening complication after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, successfully treated with defibrotide despite massive multiple organ failure. Case presentation A 64 -year-old Caucasian woman underwent allogeneic peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>stem-cell</b> transplantation from her human leukocyte antigen-identical sister against aggressive lymphoplasmocytoid immunocytoma. Seven days later, the patient developed severe sinusoidal obstruction syndrome according to the modified Seattle criteria. We initiated treatment with defibrotide. Despite early treatment, multiple organ failure with kidney failure requiring dialysis and ventilator-dependent lung failure aggravated the clinical course. Furthermore, central nervous dysfunction occurred as well as transfusion refractory thrombocytopenia. Conclusion As highlighted in our report, defibrotide is the most promising drug {{in the treatment of}} the formerly, almost lethal, severe sinusoidal obstruction syndrome to date. This is demonstrated very clearly in our patient. She improved completely, even after renal, cerebral and respiratory failure. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{increased}} {{incidence of}} different malignancies associated to {{chronic lymphocytic leukemia}} (CLL) has been reported. The association of CLL and acute leukemia is a rare event described in < 1 % of CLL, the type of acute leukemia being either from the lymphoid or more often from the myeloid lineage. The coexistence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and CLL in the same patient has been occasionally reported. Most of these cases {{have been associated with}} the administration of chemotherapy or radioterapy for CLL, suggesting that the former may be a secondary leukemia. On the other hand, CLL could precede, but could also be diagnosed at the same, or delayed time as AML, suggesting the presence of other leukemogenic factors.

40|$|Hafnia alvei is a motile gram-negative {{bacterium}} that is rarely isolated from human specimens, but that sometimes {{can be found}} {{as part of the}} gastrointestinal flora. Here we report a rare case of Hafnia alvei septicemia with an abdominal abscess in a 60 -year-old woman with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma involving the spleen, liver, and then lymph nodes. She initially received a splenectomy, and, over a 2 -year period, four courses of chemotherapy. After achieving complete remission status, she underwent autologous peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>stem-cell</b> transplantation (PBSCT). During the aplastic phase following transplantation, the patient developed fever, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, with blood cultures positive for Hafnia alvei and an abscess in the splenic recess. Considering the high surgical risk, the infection was treated, successfully, with antibiotics (imipenem/cilastatin), without surgery or computed tomography (CT) -guided percutaneous drainage.

40|$|Renal {{amyloidosis}} {{is typically}} characterized by nephrotic syndrome, often with massive proteinuria and refractory peripheral edema. We report {{the case of}} a patient with renal amyloidosis associated with nephrotic syndrome who maintained remission for 6 years after undergoing high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>stem-cell</b> transplantation (auto-PBSCT). The patient was a man aged in his 50 s who had developed nephrotic syndrome. Bone marrow aspiration and kidney biopsy determined that the cause of the nephrotic syndrome was renal amyloidosis due to multiple myeloma, and the patient was admitted to our department in July 2003. After one course of chemotherapy, auto-PBSCT was performed in March 2004. Following transplantation, serum M-protein was no longer detectable from March 2005, and the patient achieved complete hematological remission. Subsequently, proteinuria decreased, serum albumin levels normalized, and nephrotic syndrome improved. As of 6 years after transplantation, in March 2010, the patient remained in remission, meaning that auto-PBSCT proved extremely effective as a treatment for renal amyloidosis in this case...|$|E
40|$|Patients with relapsed Hodgkin's disease who re-spond {{to salvage}} therapy are {{successfully}} treated with cyclophosphamide, carmustine (BCNU), and etoposide (VP- 16) (CBV) followed by autologous {{bone marrow transplantation}} (ABMT). Because of heavy pretreat-ment including radiation to the pelvic site, marrow harvest was not feasible in those patients. We there-fore used blood-derived hemopoietic precursor cells as an alternative stem-cell source to rescue them after superdose chemotherapy. Hemopoietic precursor cells were mobilized into the peripheral blood either by chemotherapeutic induction of transient myelosuppres-sion followed by an overshooting of <b>blood</b> <b>stem-cell</b> concentration, or by continuous intravenous (IV) gran-ulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) administration.

40|$|The role of {{high-dose}} chemotherapy in {{the management}} of women with breast cancer {{remains one of the most}} controversial issues in oncology. During the past decade, numerous pilot studies have shown the feasibility of ad-ministering high-dose chemotherapy followed by autolo-gous bone marrow transplantation or peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>stem-cell</b> transplantation (referred to as high-dose chemo-therapy) to women with metastatic disease. However, it appears that survival improves in few treated patients.

The National Cancer Institute has se-lected two randomized, adjuvant breast cancer trials for its High-Priority Clinical Trials Program. These trials are com-paring conventional-dose chemotherapy with high-dose chemotherapy in patients in the early stages of breast cancer who are at high risk for disease recurrence. This paper focuses on the rationale for the randomized studies evaluating adjuvant high-dose chemotherapy in the early stages of breast cancer and reviews the efforts to overcome physician and patient biases so that the trials can be completed...|$|E
40|$|POEMS {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} paraneoplastic condition associated to an underlying plasmacellular dyscrasia. The pathogenesis of POEMS is poorly understood, but overproduction of VEGF, probably secreted by clonal plasma cells, {{is thought to be}} responsible for the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, {{and it seems to be}} useful for the monitoring of the response to therapy. At present, an effective therapeutic option for the patients is represented by autologous peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>stem-cell</b> transplantation (aPBSCT), although relapses have been described, and there is an important morbidity associated with this procedure. Before the implementation of aPBSCT, the clinical course of POEMS syndrome was characterized by progressive polyneuropathy potentially leading to death for respiratory failure. Given the high serum and plasma levels of VEGF observed in POEMS patients, the use of anti-angiogenetic drugs such as thalidomide and lenalidomide and other drugs with anti-VEGF and anti-TNF effect such as bortezomib have been considered to treat this syndrome. There are evidences of lenalidomide benefit in both front-line and previously treated patients, but scanty data are available about its use for relapse after aPBSCT. Here, we report the successful use of lenalidomide in a patient who relapsed after aPBSCT...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The role of {{chemotherapy}} dose-intensification in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains unclear. This phase I-II study evaluates feasibility and outcome of combination chemotherapy at moderately elevated doses with concomitant thoracic radiotherapy in limited-disease SCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Moderately elevated doses of ifosfamide-epirubicin (cycles 1 and 3) and of carboplatin-etoposide (cycles 2 and 4) were given with G-CSF and peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>stem-cell</b> (PBSC) support. Thoracic radiotherapy (40 Gy) was given once daily {{during the first}} five days of each cycle. RESULTS: Overall toxicity was acceptable; most common side-effects were myelosuppression and asthenia. All 35 eligible patients responded (23 CR, 12 PR). Median time to progression was 15 months: median overall survival was 24. 6 months. Only 6 of 25 relapsing patients (24 %) presented with a locoregional recurrence while 12 of 25 (48 %) relapsed in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). CONCLUSIONS: This regimen is a feasible dose-intensification with an acceptable toxicity profile. Its efficacy was demonstrated by a 100 % response rate, an excellent local tumor control rate and a median survival of 24. 6 months.

40|$|Abstract: Hyperprolactinemia is {{a common}} endocrinological {{disorder}} that {{may be caused by}} several physiological and pathological conditions. Several drugs may determine a significant increase in prolactin serum concentration that is frequently associated with symptoms. The so-called typical antipsychotics are frequently responsible for drug-related hyperprolactinemia. Risperidone is one of the atypical neuroleptics most likely to induce hyperprolactinemia, while other atypical drugs are unfrequenlty and only transiently associated with increase of prolactin levels. Women are more sensitive than men to the hyperprolactinemic effect of antipsychotics. Classical and risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia may be revert when a gradual antipsychotic drug discontinuation is combined with olanzapine or clozapine initiation. Antidepressant drugs with serotoninergic activity, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-I) and some tricyclics, can cause hyperprolactinemia. A long list of other compounds may determine an increase in prolactin levels, including prokinetics, opiates, estrogens, anti-androgens, anti-hypertensive drugs, H 2 -receptor antagonists, anti-convulsivants and cholinomimetics. Finally, hyperprolactinemia has also been documented during conditioning and after autologous <b>blood</b> <b>stem-cell</b> transplantation and during chemotherapy, even though disturbances of prolactin seem to occur less frequently than impairments of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad/thyroid axis after intensive treatment and blood marrow transplantation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) is a {{plasma cell}} {{neoplasm}} that presents as a solitary tumor. EMP in the gastrointestinal organs are extremely uncommon. Presentation of case: A 36 -year-old man {{was admitted to}} our hospital with advanced anemia. He had no specific medical history. Gastroendoscopic findings showed an 8. 0 -cm submucosal tumor with ulcer on the greater curvature of the gastric body. Fine-needle aspiration was performed, and the pathologic diagnosis of the submucosal tumor was a plasmacytoma. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with gastric plasmacytoma. A total gastrectomy was performed with lymphadenectomy. The result of intraoperative peritoneal lavage cytology was positive. Histological examination revealed serosa-exposed plasmacytoma of the stomach with lymph nodes metastasis. Additionaly the patient received a three-drug chemotherapy regimen (bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone [VCD]) from 3 weeks after the operation.

40|$|Background We {{previously}} reported {{the results of}} a phase II study for patients with newly diagnosed primary central nervous system lymphoma treated with autologous peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>stem-cell</b> transplantation (aPBSCT) and response-adapted whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Now, we update the initial results. Patients and methods From 1999 to 2004, 23 patients received high-dose methotrexate. In case of at least partial remission, high-dose busulfan/thiotepa (HD-BuTT) followed by aPBSCT was carried out. Patients refractory to induction or without complete remission after HD-BuTT received WBRT. Eight patients still alive in 2011 were contacted and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life questionnaire (QLQ) -C 30 were carried out. Results Of eight patients still alive, median follow-up is 116. 9 months. Only one of nine irradiated patients is still alive with a severe neurologic deficit. In seven of eight patients treated with HD-BuTT, health condition and quality of life are excellent. MMSE and QLQ-C 30 showed remarkably good results in patients who did not receive WBRT. All of them have a Karnofsky score of 90 %- 100 %. Conclusions Follow-up shows an overall survival of 35 %.

40|$|Abstract Background A new chimerism {{analysis}} {{based on}} automated interphase fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH) evaluation was established to detect residual cells after allogene sex-mismatched bone marrow or <b>blood</b> <b>stem-cell</b> transplantation. Cells of 58 patients were characterized as disease-associated due to presence of a bcr/abl-gene-fusion or a trisomy 8 and/or a simultaneous hybridization of gonosome-specific centromeric probes. The automatic slide scanning platform Metafer with its module MetaCyte was used to analyse 3, 000 cells per sample. Results Overall 454 assays of 58 patients were analyzed. 13 of 58 patients showed residual recipient cells at one stage of more than 4 % and 12 of 58 showed residual recipient cells less than 4 %, respectively. As to be expected, patients of the latter group were associated with a higher survival rate (48 vs. 34 month). In only two of seven patients with disease-marker positive residual cells between 0. 1 – 1. 3 % a relapse was observed. Besides, disease-marker negative residual cells were found in two patients without relapse at a rate of 2. 8 % and 3. 3 %, respectively. Conclusion The definite origin and meaning of disease-marker negative residual cells is still unclear.

40|$|To asses {{the real}} {{contribution}} of pre-transplantation {{treatment in the}} incidence of secondary neoplasia after autologous transplant for lymphoproliferative disorders, we used stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria. One hundred and forty-two patients out of 323 that underwent autologous transplantation for lymphoproliferative disorders were studied. The risk factors that were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analysis included: gender, sex, age, diagnosis, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy prior to conditioning regimen, disease status at peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>stem-cell</b> transplantation (PBSCT) and type of harvest. Three patients developed secondary myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (sMDS/AML) and three patients developed solid neoplasia. By univariate analysis diagnosis chronic lymphocytic leukemia and use of fludarabine and monoclonal antibodies were the only variables significantly associated with the development of sMDS/AML. By multivariate analysis, the variables associated with sMDS/AML were the use of fludarabine and disease status at PBSCT. By univariate analysis, we found that radiotherapy and the use of monoclonal antibodies were significantly associated with the development of secondary solid neoplasia. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the only two variables significantly associated with new cancers were radiotherapy and prior treatment with monoclonal antibodies. We report the lowest incidence of sMDS/AML after autologous stem-cell transplantation for lymphoproliferative malignancies. Major reasons could be ascribed to the stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria used to establish the real incidence of sMDS/AML because of chemo-radiotherapy used before transplant procedure. The low incidence of secondary solid tumors could be caused by the absence of total body irradiation as part of the conditioning regimen or the short follow-up...|$|E
40|$|Background: The use of High-dose {{chemotherapy}} (HDC) with {{peripheral blood}} stem cells (PBSC) rescue {{in the treatment of}} solid tumors is controversial, and may be an important deter-minant of HDC and PBSC use in the future. Until the use of these procedures is proven through disease-free survival and overall survival compared with standard-dose chemotherapy, the associated cost is also under discussion. Patients and methods: We evaluate 27 consecutive patients with solid tumors who underwent HDC and PBSC rescue, through an accurate review of medical records and cost estimate for each patient. Results: Median age was 45 years. Fifteen had breast cancer, six non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and six other solid tu-mors. The mean hospital lenght of stay was 21 days and mean cost was 21, 445 US dollars (21, 232 euro). Mean cost was clearly lower for the 9 patients treated within phase III trials, 17, 571 US dollars (17, 747 euro) than for the remaining 18 patients, treated in phase I—II trials, 22, 747 US dollars (22, 975 euro) (P < 0. 001). The distribution of costs shows that wages and pharmacy account for 72 % of total cost. The distribution of pharmacy costs per patient shows that chemotherapy (56 % of pharmacy costs) and antibiotics (26 %) account for most of the cost of medication. Conclusions: Our cost estimates agree with those of most countries with national health insurance programs, and are lower than those from the USA. As wages and pharmacy account for more than 70 % of the costs, the great different among the costs estimates compared are due essentialy to doctors fees or salary and drugs utilization. Anyway, taking HDC with PBSC rescue as a model for a therapy that is more aggressive than standard, and that is associated to a possible survival improvement in indications such as relapsed high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, an adequate cost analysis is crucial both to measure cost-effectiveness and to establish payment to health care providers.

40|$|Introduction: We {{previously}} reported {{the results of}} a phase II study for patients with newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) treated with autologous peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>stem-cell</b> transplantation (aPBSCT) and responseadapted whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). The purpose of this report is to update the initial results and provide long-term data regarding overall survival, prognostic factors, and the risk of treatment-related neurotoxicity. Methods: A long-term follow-up was conducted on surviving primary central nervous system lymphoma patients having been treated according to the,,OSHO- 53 study", which was initiated by the Ostdeutsche Studiengruppe Hamatologie-Onkologie. Between August 1999 and October 2004 twentythree patients with an average age of 55 and median Karnofsky performance score of 70 % were enrolled and received high-dose mthotrexate (HD-MTX) on days 1 and 10. In case of at least a partial remission (PR), high-dose busulfan/ thiotepa (HD-BuTT) followed by aPBSCT was performed. Patients without response to induction or without complete remission (CR) after HD-BuTT received WBRT. All patients (n= 8), who are alive in 2011, were contacted and Mini Mental State examination (MMSE) and the EORTC QLQ-C 30 were performed. Results: Eight patients are still alive with a median follow-up of 116, 9 months (79 - 141, range). One of them suffered from a late relapse eight and a half years after initial diagnosis of PCNSL, another one suffers from a gall bladder carcinoma. Both patients are alive, the one with the relapse of PCNSL has finished rescue therapy and is further observed, the one with gall baldder carcinoma is still under therapy. MMSE and QlQ-C 30 showed impressive results in the patients, who were not irradiated. Only one of the irradiated patients is still alive with a clear neurologic deficit but acceptable quality of life. Conclusions: Long-term follow-up of our patients, who were included in the OSHO- 53 study show an overall survival of 30 percent. If WBRT can be avoided no long-term neurotoxicity has been observed and the patients benefit from excellent Quality of Life. Induction chemotherapy with two cycles of HD-MTX should be intensified to improve the unsatisfactory OAS of 30 percent...|$|E
