40|$|Large {{amounts of}} excess plant biomass are {{produced}} by agroindustries. Biotechnological innovations, mainly in the fermentation technology, have opened new areas for utilization of oil cakes as raw materials {{for the production of}} value added products. Oil cakes have been used as substrates in solid-state fermentation (SSF) for the enzymes production by filamentous fungi. This work deals with the optimisation of fermentation conditions which maximise the production of lipase from Aspergillus ibericus MUM 03. 49 under SSF using different oil cakes from Brazil. Combinations of oil cakes, moisture content (MC) and nitrogen sources were studied. Finally, the obtained lipase was applied in esterification reactions with different carboxylic acids and alcohols. SSFs were performed in 250 mL containing 15 g of oil cake. After lipase extraction, lipase activity was determined by spectrophotometric method, using p-nitrophenyl butyrate as substrate. Esterification reactions were performed in 15 mL falcon tubes with 5 mL volume reaction. Conversion yield was determined by the titration of the residual acid content, using 0. 1 M sodium hydroxide. Lipase production was significantly influenced by the oil cake used. Palm kernel oil cake (PKOC) presented higher lipase production (127 ± 17 U/g), following by sesame oil cake (SOC) (78 ± 2 U/g), after 7 days of SSF. The combination of oil cakes PKOC+SOC led to maximum lipase production of 328 ± 6 U/g. Also, on PKOC+CrOC (crambe oil cake) it was possible to obtain high lipase activity (272 ± 23 U/g). A central composite design was performed to set optimum MC and ratio of PKOC+SOC. A MC of 57 % and a ratio of 0. 45 : 0. 55 PKOC:SOC were determined predicting a lipase production of 360 U/g. NH 4 Cl was found to be the best nitrogen source at concentration of 1 % (w/w). From the profile of lipase production over fermentation time, it was observed a continuous enzyme activity increase till the 6 th day, reaching 460 ± 38 U/g, corresponding to a productivity of 3. 2 ± 0. 3 U/(g h); and stabilizing till the end of 20 days, yielding 578 ± 20 U/g. Finally, the whole fermented cake with lipase was lyophilized and applied in esterification reactions, combining different carboxylic acids with alcohols. A 100 % conversion yield was obtained for decanoic acid with butanol using 20 % (w/w) lipase. Optimisation process led to the use of 5 % lipase in universal buffer at pH 7 or 8, for 24 h at 37 ºC, to obtain <b>butyl</b> <b>decanoate</b> ester. The biotechnological valorisation of SSF combining oil cakes is an interesting strategy to produce considerable amounts of lipase. Further, lipase produced may be applied to produce <b>butyl</b> <b>decanoate</b> ester, a natural flavor with interest for food industry...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the actual}} {{emphasis}} in revalorization of agro-industrial wastes and cost reduction of enzymes production, this work aimed the optimization of lipase production from different oil cakes (OCs) produced in Brazil, by solid-state fermentation using Aspergillus ibericus MUM 03. 49 {{and the application of}} the produced lipase in hydrolysis and esterification reactions. Results presented showed higher lipase production using palm kernel oil cake (PKOC), yielding 127  ±  17  U/g. Through SSF optimization, using palm kernel oil cake (PKOC) mixed with sesame oil cake (SOC) in a ratio of 0. 45  g/g PKOC per g total substrate at 57 % moisture content, a production of 460  ±  38  U/g of lipase per mass of dry substrate was obtained after 6  days of fermentation. The obtained lipase was used in hydrolysis reactions, where it was observed higher production in short-chain triacylglycerols (TAGs) substrates. Also, it was applied in esterification reactions, where the formation of <b>butyl</b> <b>decanoate</b> using 5 % (w/v) of biocatalyst was the most efficient. SSF of PKOC and SOC was a low cost competitive process to obtain A. ibericus lipase {{that can be used in}} aroma esters production, with application in the food industry.
