40|$|The {{reaction}} of the latent syphilitic rabbit to inoculation with the <b>Brown-Pearce</b> <b>tumor</b> was studied in 50 standard bred rabbits representing five breeds. The mean tumor mortality rate in the combined group {{was found to be}} significantly lower than a weighted control value for normal non-syphilitic animals, and the mean tumor mortality rate for each of the five breeds studied was lower in the syphilitic group than the corresponding breed mean value for normal animals. Moreover, the relative resistance of different breeds to the <b>Brown-Pearce</b> <b>tumor</b> was not altered by the latent syphilitic infection. Certain factors which might have contributed {{to the development of a}} tumor resistant state in the syphilitic group were discussed, and evidence was presented which demonstrates that as regards the breeds under consideration, there exists a high correlation between breed resistance to Tr. pallidum infection and breed resistance to the <b>Brown-Pearce</b> <b>tumor...</b>|$|E
40|$|The serologically active {{substance}} of the <b>Brown-Pearce</b> <b>tumor,</b> a complement-fixing antigen, differs notably from certain other tissue antigens (the Wassermann, Forssman, and organ- and species-specific tissue haptens, for example) {{in the fact that}} it is not effective after alcoholic extraction of the tissue containing it. Like many of the proteins and viruses it is in-activated upon heating to 65 °C. for 30 minutes; and, like them as well, its activity is lost upon treatment with acid (to pH 4. 5 or lower) or alkali (to pH 11. 5 or higher). Filtration and centrifugation experiments disclosed the fact that the antigen of the <b>Brown-Pearce</b> <b>tumor</b> passed readily through collodion membranes with average pore diameters of 383 mµ and more, but was retained completely by those with average pore diameters of 348 mµ and less. It was thrown down completely or almost completely upon centrifugation at 20, 000 R. P. M. for one hour. The findings indicate that the <b>Brown-Pearce</b> <b>tumor</b> antigen has a large and nearly uniform particle size and weight,—as large as that of many of the viruses. They differentiate it sharply from the generality of "soluble antigens. rdquo; Upon direct comparison, the complement-fixing antigen of the <b>Brown-Pearce</b> <b>tumor</b> was found to be similar in a number of its general traits to the serologically {{active substance}} of the virus-induced papillomas of rabbits, which in turn is intimately associated or identical with the virus responsible for the papillomas.

40|$|Based on our {{original}} concept, a fibroblast-inhibiting agent, chloroquine, was used against various animal tumors. Among transplanted animal tumors, {{the drug was}} most effective on relatively connective tissue-rich Bashford and <b>Brown-Pearce</b> <b>tumors,</b> as reflected by prolongation of life span, inhibition of tumor growth, inhibition of lowering of liver catalase activity, improvement of iron metabolism, increase of tumor necrosis, inhibition of connective tissue formation, and decrease of acid mucopolysaccharide. On the other hand, it was of little advantage in Ehrlich, Yoshida and MH 134 tumors which contain little connective tissue, except for a decrease {{of the amount of}} ascites and ascites tumor cells in the former two tumors. These results indicate that chloroquine suppress the growth of the tumors relatively rich in connective tissue. This effect of chloroquine appears to be due to the primary attack of the stromal connective tissue of tumors being followed by the degeneration of tumor cells, though its probable anti-tumor activity by the indirect effects through its anti-inflammatory and systemic humoral activities should be taken into consideration. </p...|$|R
40|$|With {{the purpose}} of elucidating {{the role of the}} stroma for the growth of tumors, the {{vascular}} structures in the parenchymal stroma and the surroundings of animal tumors were studied. In the first chapter, the vascular structures of Bashford tumors and Ehrlich subcutaneous tumors were examined employing the India ink method. The Blood vessels of tumors are derived from their surrounding host connective tissue. The structure of blood vessels of every tumor has features of its own. Further, it was observed that metastatic tumors in the lungs of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and <b>Brown-Pearce</b> <b>tumors</b> had an individuality in their vascular structures. In the second chapter, the vascular structures of Ehrlich subcutaneous tumors and first generation transplants of C(3) H spontaneous mammary cancers were observed employing ultrasoft X-ray, and the relationship between the blood vessels and the stromaltissue of these tumors was investigated using several special staining methods. Characteristic features were also observed on the vascularization and the stromal tissues of Ehrlich subcutaneous tumors treated with chondroitin sulphate. In the third chapter, the influences of administration of Bleomycin on C(3) H spontaneous mammary cancers were abserved with respect to the vascular struture and stromal tissue. It was found that small tumor vessels were narrowed, obstructed and destroyed by administration of this drug. Further, it was observed that the vasculature and stromal tissue of lungs of mice and humans administered with this agent were likewise damaged, and that prednisolone and chloroquine considerably inhibited these pulmonary damages caused by this drug...|$|R
40|$|The {{recent work}} of Duran-Reynals (1) has {{demonstrated}} that simple water extracts of rat and rabbit testicle, when brought in contact with cell suspensions of the <b>Brown-Pearce</b> rabbit <b>tumor,</b> exert a definite inhibiting effect upon the transplantability and growth of cells from such suspensions in the intradermal tissues of rabbits.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{relation}} between constitution and susceptibility to disease has been studied in this laboratory through two main avenues of approach. The first has been to observe the influence on the host's reaction to disease of various environmental conditions, for example sunlight, ultraviolet radiation, darkness, and meteorological states, of operative procedures and of concomitant infections. The second approach has been {{from the standpoint of the}} genetic constitution of the host through an intensive study of breed characteristics and hereditary abnormalities. One technique which has been utilized for the latter purpose has involved observations on the reaction to disease-producing agents of pure bred rabbits of varying lineage and of known quality. Investigations along these lines have demonstrated that the differences which are represented by varying breed characters are associated with distinctive differences in the response to • infection with Treponema pallidum (1) and to inoculation with a transplantable neoplasm (2). Thus with respect to experimental syphilis, the Havana and Dutch rabbits were found to be relatively resistant while English, Rex, and Himalayan rabbits were relatively susceptible; with regard to the <b>Brown-Pearce</b> <b>tumor,</b> Havana and Himalayan animals were relatively resistant, and Dutch, Rex, and English relatively susceptible.

The rate of successful gastric transplantation of the <b>Brown-Pearce</b> <b>tumor</b> was 69. 8 per cent. The most favorite site of transplantation was the lesser curvature, and then in the order of pylorus, fundus, the greater curvature, paries ventroeranialis, paries dorsocaudalis. 2. The rate of growth of the transplanted tumor was also higher at the site, where the rate of successful transplantation is higher. The tumor cells were always observed in the vessels of the stomach in those cases with the liver metastasis. 3. Tumor in the lesser curvature most frequently caused the liver metastasis and then ranging from more to less frequency in the following order of that in the pylorus, fundus. the greater curvature, paries ventrocranialis. paries dorsocaudalis. 4. In the same case. the size of the liver metastasis could he classified into some kinds of grade, thus showing that the metastasis was formed with a certain interval and not continuously. 5.

The following results were obtained. 1. The maximum safe doses of Nitrogen mustard N-oxide, Triethylene thiophosphoramide, Carzinophilin, Mitomycin C, Actinomycin D and Toyomycin when administered by perfusion into the femoral artery of dog were 5 mg/kg., 2 mg/kg., 2. 500 units/kg., 0. 8 mg/kg., 80 γ/kg. and 100 γ/kg. respectively. 2. Under perfusion of the hind limb for periods up to 30 minutes oxygenation of the perfusing blood {{has nothing to do}} with local tissue damage. 3. On isolation perfusion under hyperthermia (40 ℃) or hypothermia (5 ℃) utilizing a heat exchanger the normal tissue damage was higher than that of normothermia. 4. The fluctuation of concentration of the drugs and the leakage factor were determined in the perfused area and systemically by means of RISA, P(32) -labeled TSPA and bio-assay of Mitomycin C. The results obtained by RISA were always higher than those of the other two, and did not indicate accurate picture in estimation of the leakage into systemic circulation. 5. The titer of Mitomycin C was unchanged by pure oxygen insufflation for 30 to 60 minutes or by the preservation mixed with whole blood in refrigerator for ten days. 6. On perfusion of the hind limb of rabbit utilizing p(32) -labeled TSPA a reversible fixation or accumulation of the drug in the perfused area was actually proved. 7. The tumoricidal effect on <b>Brown-pearce</b> <b>tumor</b> of rabbit was much evident in one-shot administration of the drug, in non-oxygenation of the blood in case of Mitomycin C, and in hyperthermic condition in case of Mitomycin C or TSPA. 8.

40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} {{intended}} to analize {{the mechanism of}} acceleration {{in the growth of}} <b>Brown-Pearce</b> <b>Tumor</b> (BPT) after splenectomy, described in my previous paper. Considering the intimate relationship between spleen and reticuloendothelial system (RES), author followed up the function of RES in BPT bearing rabbits and examined the influences of splenectomy upon them. The phagocytability of RES detemined by use of Adler-Reimann's Congored Test and the ability of antibody formation was estimated from the value of haemoagglutinin (HA), formed after the intravenous injection of 5 % physiologic saline solution of healthy O-type human red blood cells, of 3 cc per 1 Kg of body weight, into rabbit, 3 or 5 days after the transplantation. The result revealed as follows; 1) The phagocytability of rabbit was not disturbed by the implantation of BPT into the testicle and by continuous localized growth of tumor tissue, but in accordance with the beginning stadium of remote metastasis, an impairement of this function appeared gradually. 2) It was the noticeable fact that the marked deterioration of HA formation in BPT bearing rabbit occurred from such early stage of transplantation as the tumor was hardly palpable in the testicle. And that this phenomen was not due to the tissue transplantation was proved by the experimental results showing no decrease in HA formation after the implantation of the liver homogenate into a testicle of normal rabbit. 3) The fluctuation of increase in serum γ-globulin level accompanied with HA formation went parallel with values of HA in seruem. This suggested that the lowering of haemoagglutination did not depend upon the inhibition by such substance in serum as mucoprotein, but upon the poor formation of HA itself. 4) In BPT bearing rabbit, although the phagocytability was not influence by splenectomy, but the deterioration of HA formation ability showed further increase in its grade by splenectomy. 5) From the results described above, the author presumed that this marked deterioration of HA formation ability in BPT bearing rabbit was specific for the existence of growing tumor tissue, and was due not to the exhaustion of the function of RES, but probably to the preceding formation of antibody against the tumor tissue in RES, aud, in this point of view, splenectomy would give an influence upon the tumor growth as a sequela of an influence upon the fuction of RES...|$|E
