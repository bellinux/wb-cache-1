5|$|The Eurasian <b>blackcap</b> (Sylvia atricapilla) usually known {{simply as}} the <b>blackcap,</b> is a common and {{widespread}} typical warbler. It has mainly olive-grey upperparts and pale grey underparts, and differences between the five subspecies are small. Both sexes have a neat coloured cap to the head, black in the male and reddish-brown in the female. The male's typical song is a rich musical warbling, often ending in a loud high-pitched crescendo, but a simpler song is given in some isolated areas, such as valleys in the Alps. The blackcap's closest relative is the garden warbler, which looks quite different but has a similar song.|$|E
5|$|Blackcaps {{and other}} small birds are {{illegally}} trapped and hunted in large numbers in Mediterranean countries, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Malta, Libya, Egypt and Cyprus, where they are considered as a delicacy. Despite hunting and natural hazards, the European population of the <b>blackcap</b> has been rising for several decades as the range extends northwards, for example to Scotland and Denmark. There are occasional nesting records from outside the main range, such as in northern Israel and the Faroes, and wandering birds may appear further afield in Iceland or on the islands of Arctic Russia. In the Baltic, {{the spread of the}} <b>blackcap</b> appears to have been helped by the availability of territories formerly occupied by the declining barred warbler.|$|E
5|$|Fossils and subfossils of the <b>blackcap</b> {{have been}} found in a number of European countries; the oldest, dated to 1.2–1.0million years ago, are from the Early Pleistocene of Bulgaria. Fossils from France show that the Sylvia genus dates back at least 20million years.|$|E

40|$|International audienceData on <b>Blackcaps</b> {{gathered}} in 1975 - 2007 in an old-growth primeval forest (Białowieża National Park, Poland) are analysed {{to see whether}} the species numbers, breeding phenology or reproduction showed any long-term trends. Neither the clutch size (mean 4. 8) nor the nesting success (c. 38 %) changed, but a number of directional changes during 33  years were observed. In comparison with the 1970 s, in the twenty-first century, <b>Blackcaps</b> arrived over 2  weeks earlier, but advanced egg-laying by only 8  days. The breeding numbers increased threefold; they had been increasing slowly before 2000, but almost exponentially from 2001 onwards. The densities raised to c. 10 pairs/ 10  ha in luxuriant riverine habitats. Due to structural changes in the oak-hornbeam habitat, in the twenty-first century, <b>Blackcaps</b> situated nests lower and less frequently in conifers. The numerical increases were only partially accountable by structural changes in local habitats, but they were concordant with large-scale increases of <b>Blackcaps</b> across W Europe. It is hypothesised that the forest has recently been invaded by <b>Blackcaps</b> from strongly increasing, SW migrating, populations...|$|R

5|$|Giovanni Verga's 1871 novel Storia di una capinera, {{according}} to its author, {{was inspired by a}} story of a <b>blackcap</b> trapped and caged by children. The bird, silent and pining for its lost freedom, eventually dies. In the book, a nun evacuated from her convent by cholera {{falls in love with a}} family friend, only to have to return to her confinement when the disease wanes. The novel was adapted as films of the same name in 1917, 1943 and 1993. The last version was directed by Franco Zeffirelli, and its English-language version was retitled as Sparrow. In Saint François d'Assise, an opera by Messiaen, the orchestration is based on bird song. St Francis himself is represented by the <b>blackcap.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>blackcap</b> has a {{very large}} range, and its {{population}} in Europe is estimated at 25–49million breeding pairs. Allowing for birds breeding in Africa and Asia, the total population is between 80–196million individuals. It is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{continental}} {{breeding range}} of the <b>blackcap</b> lies between the 14–30° July isotherms, and is occupied by the nominate subspecies, the other forms being restricted to islands or fringe areas in the Caucasus and eastern Iberia. Birds on the Mediterranean and Atlantic islands and in the milder west {{and south of the}} main Eurasian distribution often winter within the nesting range, but populations elsewhere are migratory. The <b>blackcap</b> is a leap-frog migrant; birds from the north of the breeding range travel furthest south, whereas Mediterranean breeders move much shorter distances. The wintering areas overlap with the breeding range, but also include extensive areas in West Africa, East Africa south to Lake Malawi, and further north in Ethiopia, South Sudan and Eritrea. The large majority of birds wintering in eastern Africa are of the southwest Asian race, S. a. dammholzi.|$|E
40|$|Migration causes {{temporal}} and energetic constraints during plumage development, which can compromise feather structure and function. In turn, {{given the importance}} of a good quality of flight feathers in migratory movements, selection may have favoured the synthesis of feathers with better mechanical properties than expected from a feather production constrained by migration necessities. However, no study has assessed whether migratory behaviour affects the relationship between the mechanical properties of feathers and their structural characteristics. We analysed bending stiffness (a feather mechanical property which is relevant to birds' flight), rachis width and mass (two main determinants of variation in bending stiffness) of wing and tail feathers in migratory and sedentary <b>blackcaps</b> Sylvia atricapilla. Migratory <b>blackcaps</b> produced feathers with a narrower rachis in both wing and tail, but their feathers were not significantly lighter; in addition, bending stiffness was higher in migratory <b>blackcaps</b> than in sedentary <b>blackcaps.</b> Such unexpected result for bending stiffness remained when we statistically controlled for individual variation in rachis width and feather mass, which suggests the existence of specific mechanisms that help migratory <b>blackcaps</b> to improve the mechanical behaviour of their feathers under migration constraints...|$|R
40|$|The retinas {{of birds}} and other {{vertebrates}} undergo morphological and physiological changes throughout the day, which help regulate daily changes in visual sensitivity. One particular change is the contraction and elongation of photoreceptor outer segments, which is regulated by an endogenous circadian clock. Normally, <b>Blackcaps</b> (Sylvia atricapilla) are diurnal, but they migrate at night. In the current experiment, outer segment lengths of migrating and non-migrating <b>Blackcaps</b> were measured throughout the day and analyzed, and they show a trend toward circadian rhythmicity across the day. There {{also appears to be}} an advance in the phase of the rhythm in retinomotor movements when birds are migrating. These results indicate that circadian-controlled retinomotor movements could be modifications within the retina to accommodate the nocturnal lifestyle of migratory <b>Blackcaps.</b> We hypothesize that a change in retinal physiology and morphology may allow the formation of a migratory ?night-vision? to accommodate the migrating <b>Blackcap?s</b> nocturnal lifestyle...|$|R
40|$|Temporal and {{energetic}} constraints associated with migration may compromise plumage quality and, ultimately, flight ability in migratory birds. As a consequence, migrants may invest more resources {{in parts of}} the plumage that are essential for long, sustained flight (such as the primary wing feathers) than in less important feather tracts. We used migratory and sedentary <b>Blackcaps</b> (Sylvia atricapilla) to analyze within- and between-individual variation in the mass and quality of wing and tail feathers. Migratory <b>Blackcaps</b> in both adult and juvenile plumage had lighter tail feathers than sedentary <b>Blackcaps,</b> but the primary feathers were of similar mass. Interestingly, the quality of primary and tail feathers (estimated from the mass of the feather in relation to its size) were positively correlated within individuals. However, migratory individuals had higher-quality primary feathers than sedentary individuals, given the quality of their tail feathers. Therefore, migratory <b>Blackcaps</b> appeared to preferentially allocate limited resources to primary feathers {{at the expense of the}} quality of the less important tail feathers. We suggest that this represents an adaptive mechanism to reduce the costs of migration constraints on plumage functionality. ...|$|R
5|$|The genus Sylvia, {{the typical}} warblers, forms {{part of a}} large family of Old World warblers, the Sylviidae. Fossils from France show that the genus dates back at least 20million years. The garden warbler and its nearest relative, the <b>blackcap,</b> are an ancient species pair which diverged very early {{from the rest of the}} genus, between 12 and 16million years ago. In the course of time, these two species have become {{sufficiently}} distinctive that they have been placed in separate subgenera, with the <b>blackcap</b> in subgenus Sylvia and the garden warbler in Epilais. These sister species have a breeding range which extends farther northeast than all other Sylvia species except the lesser whitethroat and common whitethroat.|$|E
5|$|The only blood parasites {{found in}} a study of blackcaps trapped on {{migration}} were protozoans from the genera Haemoproteus and Plasmodium. Of those affected, 45.5% were males and 22.7% were females, but the number of parasites was small, and the ability to store fat for the migration flight was unimpaired. Seventeen strains of H. parabelopolskyi are found only in the <b>blackcap,</b> and form a monophyletic group; three further members of that group are found only in the garden warbler, and another three occur in the African hill babbler, supporting the shared ancestry of the three bird species. The protozoan Isospora ashmoonensis was first identified in a <b>blackcap</b> in Egypt. Blackcaps may carry parasitic worms that sometimes kill their hosts. External parasites include chewing lice and feather mites. The latter do little damage, although heavy infestations cause individual tail feathers to develop asymmetrically.|$|E
5|$|The <b>blackcap</b> breeds {{in much of}} Europe, western Asia and northwestern Africa, and its {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} mature deciduous woodland. The male holds a territory when breeding, which is defended against garden warblers {{as well as other}} blackcaps. The nest is a neat cup, built low in brambles or scrub, and the clutch is typically 4–6 mainly buff eggs, which hatch in about 11days. The chicks fledge in 11–12days, but are cared for by both adults for some time after leaving the nest. The <b>blackcap</b> is a partial migrant; birds from the colder areas of its range winter in scrub or trees in northwestern Europe, around the Mediterranean and in tropical Africa. Some German birds have adapted to spending the winter in gardens in Great Britain and Ireland. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, but, {{for the rest of the}} year, blackcaps survive primarily on small fruit. Garden birds also eat bread, fat and peanuts in winter.|$|E
40|$|In 2003, two {{sampling}} {{strategies were}} applied {{in order to}} evaluate metal contamination in passerine bird feathers. One strategy included the use of nest boxes and nestling great tits in a forest habitat (MU). The other strategy focused {{on the use of}} mist nets to capture adult blackbirds, robins and <b>blackcaps</b> in a fragmented non-forested habitat (EST). There was a significantly higher concentration of mercury in great tits (1. 09 +/- A 0. 40) sampled in MU and also in robins (3. 44 +/- A 0. 91) and <b>blackcaps</b> (1. 62 +/- A 1. 99) sampled in EST, in comparison to the reference site (0. 66 +/- A 0. 68; 2. 04 +/- A 1. 12; 0. 32 +/- A 0. 43; respectively). Concerning interspecific differences, robins accumulated significantly more metals than blackbirds or <b>blackcaps...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{eggs are}} {{incubated}} {{for an average}} of 11days (range 10–16). Both adults incubate, although only the female stays on the nest at night. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 11–12days after hatching, leaving the nest shortly before they are able to fly. They are assisted with feeding for a further two or three weeks. If the nest is threatened, the non-incubating bird gives an alarm call so that the sitting parent and chicks stay still and quiet. A male <b>blackcap</b> may mob a potential predator, or try to lure it away with disjointed runs and flaps on the ground. The <b>blackcap</b> normally raises just one brood, but second nestings are sometimes recorded, particularly in the milder climate of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic islands; triple brooding has been observed once, the female laying a total of 23 eggs in the season.|$|E

The nearest relatives of the garden warbler outside the sister group are believed to be the African hill babbler and Dohrn's thrush-babbler, both of which should probably be placed in Sylvia rather than their current genera, Pseudoalcippe and Horizorhinus respectively.|$|E
5|$|In his History of Animals, Aristotle {{considered}} that the garden warbler eventually metamorphosed into a <b>blackcap.</b> The composer Olivier Messiaen used {{the song of}} the garden warbler as the basis for his 1971 solo piano piece La fauvette des jardins, the title being the French name of the species. His Turangalîla-Symphonie, a major work inspired by the legend of Tristan and Iseult, has a summer garden scene as its sixth movement.

5|$|<b>Blackcaps</b> have a {{complete}} moult in their breeding areas in August and September prior to migration. Some birds, typically those migrating the greatest distances, have a further partial moult between December and March. Juveniles replace their loosely structured body feathers with adult plumage, starting earlier, but taking longer to complete, than the adults. <b>Blackcaps</b> breeding {{in the north of}} the range have an earlier and shorter post-juvenile moult than those further south, and cross-breeding of captive birds shows that the timing is genetically controlled.|$|R

5|$|Sylvia warblers are {{unusual in}} that they vigorously defend their territories against other members of their genus as well as conspecifics. Blackcaps and garden warblers use {{identical}} habits in the same wood, yet aggressive interactions mean that their territories never overlap. Similar songs are {{a feature of the}} Sylvia warblers as a group, and {{it has been suggested that}} this promotes interspecific competition and helps to segregate territories between related species. It appears more likely from later studies that segregation of sympatric species, other than the <b>blackcap</b> and garden warbler, is due to subtle habitat preferences rather than interspecies aggression.|$|E
5|$|The main predators of {{the garden}} warbler are Eurasian sparrowhawks and {{domestic}} cats. Some falcons will also take adults, and the Eleonora's falcon hunts the garden warbler and many other small passerines as they migrate across the Mediterranean. Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies take the eggs and young of warblers, as do mammals such as stoats, weasels and squirrels. The garden warbler is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The <b>blackcap</b> has a much lower level of parasitism than its relative because the cuckoo's eggs are often rejected.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} a slight decline in numbers in Europe since 1980, {{although}} the Scandinavian population is growing. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and <b>blackcap.</b> Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.|$|E

5|$|External parasites of {{the garden}} warbler include the fleas Ceratophyllus gallinae and Dasypsyllus gallinulae and the mite Syringophilosis borini, named after its host. Two species of {{protozoan}} parasites in the genus Isospora occur in garden warblers, I. sylvianthina and I. sylviae. Samples from two sites showed infection levels above 74% and 28% respectively for the two species. The extent of infection does not impact on the bird's body mass or the amount of body fat. Three strains of another protozoan, Haemoproteus parabelopolskyi are found only in the garden warbler, and form a monophyletic group. Seventeen further members of that group are found only in the <b>blackcap,</b> and another three occur in the African hill babbler, supporting the shared ancestry of the three bird species.|$|E
5|$|The Iago sparrow is gregarious while {{foraging}} and breeding. Outside of {{the breeding}} season, Iago sparrows {{are always in}} flocks, which may be of considerable size. It flocks with other birds, even warblers such as the <b>blackcap</b> and the Cape Verde warbler. The Iago sparrow is not very shy toward humans, allowing them to approach, even while it is at its nest. Birds on the isolated and uninhabited island of Raso will even perch on human visitors with little fear. Because of the scarcity of water to drink in its habitat, it has a strong attraction to sources of water, and large flocks may congregate when humans provide water it can drink. It often is seen dust bathing in small groups, a behavior necessary to keep clean with a paucity of water.|$|E
5|$|The <b>blackcap</b> feeds {{mainly on}} insects during the {{breeding}} season, then switches to fruit in late summer, the change being triggered by an internal biological rhythm. When migrants arrive on their territories they initially take berries, pollen and nectar {{if there are}} insufficient insects available, then soon switch to their preferred diet. They mainly pick prey off foliage and twigs, but may occasionally hover, flycatch or feed on the ground. Blackcaps eat {{a wide range of}} invertebrate prey, although aphids are particularly important early in the season, and flies, beetles and caterpillars are also taken in large numbers. Small snails are swallowed whole, since the shell is a source of calcium for the bird's eggs. Chicks are mainly fed soft-bodied insects, fruit only being provided if invertebrates are scarce.|$|E
40|$|Although parasites may impair the {{expression}} of tail ornaments in birds, the importance of parasitism in driving {{the evolution of the}} initial stages of tail ornamentation is not well understood. Parasites could have negatively affected {{the expression}} of nonexaggerated, functional traits before these evolved ornaments, or they could have played a relevant role only after tails became ornamental and hence too costly to produce. To shed light on this issue, we studied the correlation between the abundance of feather mites (Acari, Proctophyllodidae) and the size, quality, growth rate and symmetry of tail feathers of <b>blackcaps</b> (Sylvia atricapilla), a non-ornamented passerine. Tail length was not correlated with mite load, yet <b>blackcaps</b> holding many mites at the moment of feather growth (fledglings) had lighter and more asymmetric feathers that grew at relatively lower rates. In <b>blackcaps</b> whose mite load was measured one year after feather growth (adults), only the negative correlation between mite intensity an...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis The {{success of}} {{migration}} of small passerine birds {{depends largely on}} effective refueling at stopover sites. In our previous studies, we found that hypothermia facilitates accumulation of fuel {{at the beginning of}} a stopover. Later we found that <b>blackcaps,</b> Sylvia atricapilla, might further reduce their energy expenditure by huddling while at rest. Here, we report experimental results supporting our hypothesis that huddling is beneficial to small migrating passerines both from energetic and thermoregulatory points of view. To test this hypothesis we measured metabolic rates and body temper-atures of seven <b>blackcaps</b> placed in respirometry chambers overnight, either solitarily or in groups of three or four at ambient temperatures of 5, 10, and 158 C. Concurring with our predictions, huddling <b>blackcaps</b> maintained higher body temperatures than did solitary birds, but had mass-specific metabolic rates lower by 30 % than those of solitary individuals. Based on our previous studies, we estimated energy savings through huddling to be comparable to energ...|$|R
