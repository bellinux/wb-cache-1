[...] For many days we wondered, {{and it was the}} one ever-interesting subject of conversation {{to the end of the}} voyage. We asked the cook, in fine weather, how he felt when he saw his stove [...] "reared up on end." [...] We inquired, in the north-east trade and on serene evenings, whether he had to stand on his head to put things right somewhat. We suggested he had used his <b>bread-board</b> for a raft, and from there comfortably had stoked his grate; and we did our best to conceal our admiration under the wit of fine irony. He affirmed not to know anything about it, rebuked our levity, declared himself, with solemn animation, to have been the object of a special mercy for the saving of our unholy lives. Fundamentally he was right, no doubt; but he need not have been so offensively positive about it--he need not have hinted so often that it would have gone hard with us had he not been there, meritorious and pure, to receive the inspiration and the strength for the work of grace. Had we been saved by his recklessness or his agility, we could have at length become reconciled to the fact; but to admit our obligation to anybody's virtue and holiness alone was as difficult for us as for any other handful of mankind. Like many benefactors of humanity, the cook took himself too seriously, and reaped the reward of irreverence. We were not un-ungrateful, however. He remained heroic. His saying--the saying of his life--became proverbial in the mouth of men as are the sayings of conquerors or sages. Later, whenever one of us was puzzled by a task and advised to relinquish it, he would express his determination to persevere and to succeed by the words:--"As long as she swims I will cook!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Plunkett {{had lifted}} and <b>bread-boarded</b> a {{transistorized}} tone-circuit from the Thomas Organ (an electric solid state transistorized organ) {{to duplicate the}} Jennings 3-position circuit. After adjusting and testing the amplifier with an electronic oscillator and oscilloscope, Plunkett connected the output to the speaker and tested the circuit audibly. At that point, several engineers and technical consultants, including Bill Page and Del Casher, noticed the sound effect caused by the circuit. Page insisted on testing this <b>bread-boarded</b> circuit while he played his saxophone through an amplifier. John Glennon, an assistant junior electronics engineer with the Thomas Organ Company, was summoned to bring a volume control pedal which {{was used in the}} Vox Continental Organ so that the transistorized MRB potentiometer <b>bread-boarded</b> circuit could be installed in the pedal's housing. After the installation, Page began playing his saxophone through the pedal and had asked Joe Banaron, CEO of Warwick Electronics Inc./Thomas Organ Company, to listen to the effect. At this point the first electric guitar was plugged into the prototype wah pedal by guitarist Del Casher who suggested to Joe Banaron that this was a guitar effects pedal rather than a wind instrument effects pedal. Banaron, being a fan of the big band style of music, was interested in marketing the wah pedal for wind instruments as suggested by Page rather than for the electric guitar as suggested by Casher. After a remark by Casher to Banaron regarding the Harmon mute style of trumpet playing in the famous recording of [...] "Sugar Blues" [...] from the 1930s, Banaron decided to market the wah-wah pedal using Clyde McCoy's name for endorsement.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The CALETGamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) is the {{secondary}} scientific {{instrument of the}} CALET mission on the International Space Station (ISS), which is scheduled for launch by H-IIB/HTV in 2014. The CGBM provides a broadband energy coverage from 7 keV to 20 MeV, and simultaneous observations with the primary instrument Calorimeter (CAL) in the GeV- TeV gamma-ray range and Advanced Star Camera (ASC) in the optical for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and other X-gamma-ray transients. The CGBM consists of two kinds of scintillators: two LaBr 3 (Ce) (7 keV- 1 MeV) and one BGO (100 keV- 20 MeV) each read by a single photomultiplier. The LaBr 3 (Ce) crystal, used in space {{for the first time}} here for celestial gamma-ray observations, enables GRB observations over a broad energy range from low energy X-ray emissions to gamma rays.

The first contribution has been for the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan. Under ASI contract, SG provided two Principal Investigator (PI) instruments, including the VIS channel of the Visible Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS). Within Rosetta, the ESA mission to the comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, SG have been the Industrial responsible for three Italian PI experiments, including the Visible IR Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) for VIS/NIR remote sensing. Within ESA mission Venus Express to Venus, SG provided another VIRTIS Spectrometer; launched on November 2005, VIRTIS is providing images and spectra of the Venusian atmosphere, from the top up to down nearly to the surface. More recently, SG have realized for ASI the VIR-MS imaging spectrometer for NASA Dawn mission; launched on September 2007, the VIR-MS will perform the VIS/NIR remote sensing of the asteroids Vesta (2011) and Ceres (2015).

40|$|Project (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. A sudden {{unexpected}} death during epilepsy (SUDEP) {{can occur}} to an unattended epilepsy sufferer. The cessation {{of heart and}} breathing activity is associated with SUDEP. Therefore, developing a heart and breathing monitoring system that could alarm when an epilepsy patient experiences cessation of heart or breathing activity is necessary. This system will assist healthcare providers {{to respond to the}} emergency and prevent sudden death. This collaborative project is to investigate the feasibility of developing a miniature, unobtrusive, and self-contained module that an epilepsy patient could wear in bed and a small bedside alarm unit intended to alert healthcare providers to prevent SUDEP. The wearable unit communicates wirelessly occurrences of breaths and heartbeats to the bedside unit. The bedside unit alerts upon cessation of heart or breathing activity. This project assumed that the monitor receives an input voltage from a small strip of piezoelectric film made of polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) attached to the patient???s chest. The PVDF sensor voltage changes in response both to the chest expansion and contraction of breathing and to the chest vibrations caused by heartbeats. In the first stage of this project, human subject recordings of PVDF, strain-gauge plethysmography (SPG),and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals were analyzed to determine how to design the signal processing needed to separate out individual breathing and heartbeat signals. Then, low-power analog, microcontroller, and wireless technologies were used to build a prototype of the wearable module to separate out the breathing and heartbeat signals, detect individual breaths and heartbeats, and telemeter the detected breaths and heartbeats to the bedside unit. A prototype of the bedside unit was built using similar technologies to receive the occurrences of heartbeats and breaths from the wearable module. This unit also calculates heart and breathing rates and determines whether or not to alarm if breaths or heartbeats cease or the wireless link fails to function. For convenience, the wearable module and bedside unit were prototyped using <b>bread-boarded</b> circuitry and commercial development boards containing the miniature electronic components. Once feasibility is shown, the wearable module and bedside unit can be compacted by incorporating the miniature electronic components directly into custom integrated circuits. The performance of the signal processing algorithm to separate out breathing and heartbeat signals and to detect individual breaths and heartbeats was tested by using the algorithm to process PVDF recordings from human subjects and comparing the results with SPG recordings of breaths and PPG recordings of heartbeats from the same human subjects. Miss Swetha Seshu Ayyagari designed the hardware for the signal conditioning circuit and the software for digital signal processing to separate out the breathing and heartbeat signals from the PVDF signal. Mr. Pritam Rajendra Chopda designed the software to detect individual breaths and heartbeats, transmit detected breaths and heartbeats to the bedside unit, calculate heart and breathing rate, and alert upon cessation of heartbeats or breathing or wireless link failure. Prototypes were successfully built of the wearable module and bedside unit. The prototype wearable module was capable of processing an incoming PVDF signal, separating out breathing and heartbeat signals, detecting individual breaths and heartbeats, and wirelessly transmitting them to the bedside unit. The prototype bedside unit was capable of alarming if breaths or heartbeats stopped or if the wireless link failed.

40|$|The Space Station Module Power Management and Distribution (SSM/PMAD) <b>bread-board</b> is a {{test bed}} for the {{development}} of advanced power system control and automation. Software control in the SSM/PMAD breadboard is through co-operating systems, called Autonomous Agents. Agents can be a mixture of algorithmic software and expert systems. The early SSM/PMAD system was envisioned as being completely autonomous. It soon became apparent, though, that there would always be a need for human intervention, at least as long as a human interacts with the system in any way. In a system designed only for autonomous operation, manual intervention meant taking full control of the whole system, and loosing whatever expertise was in the system. Several methods for allowing humans to interact at an appropriate level of control were developed. This paper examines some of these intermediate modes of autonomy. The least humanly intrusive mode is simple monitoring. The ability to modify future behavior by altering a schedule involves high-level interaction. Modification of operating activities comes next. The coarsest mode of control is individual, unplanned operation of individual Power System components.

40|$|A {{prototype}} {{data link}} using a Ka-band space qualified, high efficiency 200 W TWT amplifier and a <b>bread-board</b> modem emulator {{were created to}} explore the feasibility of very high speed communications in satellite-to-earth applications. Experiments were conducted using a DVB-S 2 -like waveform with modifications to support up to 20 Gbps through the addition of 128 -Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). Limited by the bandwidth of the amplifier, a constant peak symbol rate of 3. 2 Giga-symbols/sec was selected and the modulation order was varied to explore what peak data rate might be supported by an RF link through this amplifier. Using 128 -QAM, an implementation loss of 3 dB was observed at 20 Gbps, and the loss decreased as data rate or bandwidth were reduced. Building on this measured data, realistic link budget calculations were completed. Low-Earth orbit (LEO) missions based on this TWTA with reasonable hardware assumptions and antenna sizing {{are found to be}} bandwidth-limited, rather than power-limited, making the spectral efficiency of 9 / 10 -rate encoded 128 -QAM very attractive.

One of the main problems affecting the tracking of occulted GPS signals is the premature phase lock loss, due in particular to anomalous propagation phenomena (i. e., multipath, defocusing, tropospheric scintillations, etc.) occurring through the lower troposphere. Such effects may cause the refractivity close to Earth's surface to be unretrieved or negatively biased (when compared with the meteorological analysis). One of the possible solutions to mitigate the signal fading through the lower atmosphere is the adoption of open-loop tracking channels in the hardware design of the receivers. This is the strategy implemented in the new GPS radio occultation receiver (ROSA) developed by the Italian Space Agency. Some insight about the prediction model for the incoming frequency needed for open-loop purposes and its validation with real occultation data are given. Moreover, a measurement campaign with the ROSA <b>bread-board</b> is planned for the next 2006 year {{on the top of a}} mountain, in order to test and to validate the receiver.

40|$|The CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) is the {{secondary}} scientific {{instrument of the}} CALET mission on the International Space Station (ISS), which is scheduled for launch by H-IIB/HTV in 2014. The CGBM provides a broadband energy coverage from 7 keV to 20 MeV, and simultaneous observations with the primary instrument Calorimeter (CAL) in the GeV - TeV gamma-ray range and Advanced Star Camera (ASC) in the optical for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and other X-gamma-ray transients. The CGBM consists of two kinds of scintillators: two LaBr$_ 3 $(Ce) (7 keV - 1 MeV) and one BGO (100 keV - 20 MeV) each read by a single photomultiplier. The LaBr$_ 3 $(Ce) crystal, used in space {{for the first time}} here for celestial gamma-ray observations, enables GRB observations over a broad energy range from low energy X-ray emissions to gamma rays. The detector performance and structures have been verified using the <b>bread-board</b> model (BBM) via vibration and thermal vacuum tests. The CALET is currently in the development phase of the proto-flight model (PFM) and the pre-flight calibration of the CGBM is planned for August 2013. In this paper, we report on the current status and expected performance of CALET for GRB observations.

40|$|Abstract: Total power {{radiometer}} has {{a simple}} configuration {{and the best}} theoretical resolution. Gain fluctuations and calibration errors, however, can induce severe errors in the solved scene brightness temperature. To estimate the overall radiometer performance we present a numerical simulation tool {{that can be used}} to determine the radiometric resolution. Our model considers three main components that degrade the radiometric resolution: thermal noise, 1 /f noise and calibration errors. These error sources have long been known to exist, but comprehensive models able to account all these effects quantitatively and accurately in a practical manner have been missing. We have developed a radiometer simulation model that is able to produce radiometer signals that incorporate realistic radiometer effects that show up as noise and other errors in the radiometer video signal. Our simulation tool integrates the fundamental radiometer theories numerically and allows the investigation of different calibration schemes and receiver topologies. The model can be used as a guide for design and optimization as well as for verification of the radiometer performance. Moreover, it can be extended to a much larger and more complex radiometer systems allowing better system level performance estimation and optimization with minimal <b>bread-board</b> implementations. The model mimics real radiometer video data and thus the complete data analysis pipeline can be developed and verified before the real video data is available. In this paper, the model has been applied to a total power radiometer operating in the 52 GHz frequency range...|$|E
40|$|For {{mobile and}} {{portable}} applications of fuel cell technology {{there is a}} need for compact hydrogen supply systems [1]. Fuel processors are a viable option for energy supply of fuel cells owing to the high energy density of liquid fuels such as alcohols and hydrocarbon mixtures. A fuel processor is composed of the reformer reactor itself and devices dedicated to remove the carbon monoxide out of the fuel, which is frequently performed by catalytic reactions such as water-gas shift and preferential oxidation [2]. At IMM, a complete fuel processor was developed and put into operation, which was designed to supply a 5 kW fuel cell with purified reformate applying iso-octane as fuel. Iso-octane had been chosen as a model substance for gasoline. Micro-structured plates coated with noble-metal based catalysts were used to build the reactors either as monoliths or as cross-flow plate heat-exchangers. Fig. 1 a shows a flow scheme of the fuel processor, which was installed on a <b>bread-board</b> level. The test rig itself is shown in Fig. 1 b. The autothermal reformer (ATR) is shown in Fig. 2. It is composed of 200 microstructured metal foils of 400 µm thickness carrying a total of 25, 000 channels each 400 µm wide and 250 µm deep. This corresponds to a channel density of 2, 520 channels/in and a total surface area of 2. 6 m. The reactor has a width and height of 80 mm at a total length of 150 mm. It has a monolithic design.
