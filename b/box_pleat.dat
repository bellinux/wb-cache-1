40|$|The {{purpose and}} {{inspiration}} behind this design {{was to create}} a sleek gown inspired from sailors uniforms and vintage fashion. I had a goal of playing with the use of <b>box</b> <b>pleats</b> in a gown and manipulating fabric to form the desired shape. Additionally, the <b>box</b> <b>pleats</b> are used in order to add depth and angles to an otherwise softer silhouette. By using two separate colors for the outer and inner <b>box</b> <b>pleats,</b> there is a peek-a-boo effect that occurs when the dress is worn and moved in. I wanted to create a garment that will always be interesting, whether it is still or in motion. Process: When designing this gown, I started by researching marine sailors and uniforms, both vintage and current. Inspiration was also taken from other nautical garments and themes such as swimsuits, the beach, seashells, and 1940 ’s fashion. Techniques: The process of making this garment began with flat patterning the dress using slopers. A sample of the garment was then constructed using recycled bed sheets and then fit on the model. Then the final product was made using materials in navy and off-white matte satin, along with a navy Chinese satin lining. Additional materials include gold buttons and chains in order to add to the militaristic silhouette and aesthetic, along with an invisible zipper, thread, and interfacing. Special techniques used in the creation of this garment are princess seams, gathered trimmings, and <b>box</b> <b>pleating</b> for the skirt. Materials: 100 -percent polyester, invisible zipper, thread...|$|R
