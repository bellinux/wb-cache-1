40|$|ABSTRACT: Replica {{exchange}} (REX) is {{a powerful}} computa-tional tool for overcoming the quasi-ergodic sampling problem of complex molecular systems.

40|$|In a parallel-plate 13. 56 MHz rf reactor {{energetic}} argon neutrals {{are created}} by charge-exchange collisions in the sheath adjacent to the powered electrode. Energetic argon neutrals are detected by sampling neutrals through a 100 Mym orifice in the cathode. Downstream the orifice neutrals are analyzed parallel to the cathode normal with a quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an energy filter having an angular acceptance of about 2. 5 degree. The pressure range considered was between 5 and 50 m Torr with dc <b>bias</b> <b>potentials</b> between - 100 and - 400 V. The measured neutral energy distributions for low pressures and low dc <b>bias</b> <b>potentials</b> have a maximum intensity at low energies slowly decreasing toward higher energies. For higher pressures and higher dc <b>bias</b> <b>potentials</b> the energy distributions have minimal intensities at low energies, exhibit a maximum at roughly 40 eV, subsequently decreasing toward higher energies.

Shortly after the ban was imposed, however, an edited summary of Brault's testimony was posted on an American blogger's website, where it was immediately accessible and became well-known to Canadians interested in the story.

50|$|The most {{prominent}} and widely used FET in modern microelectronics is the MOSFET. There are different kinds in this category, such as MISFET (metal-insulator-semiconductor field-effect transistor), and IGFET (insulated-gate FET). A schematic of a MISFET {{is shown in}} Figure 1a. The source and the drain are connected by a semiconductor and the gate is separated from the channel by a layer of insulator. If there is no <b>bias</b> (<b>potential</b> difference) applied on the gate, the band bending is induced due to the energy difference of metal conducting band and the semiconductor Fermi level. Therefore a higher concentration of holes is formed on the interface of the semiconductor and the insulator. When an enough positive bias is applied on the gate contact, the bended band becomes flat. If a larger positive bias is applied, the band bending {{in the opposite direction}} occurs and the region close to the insulator-semiconductor interface becomes depleted of holes. Then the depleted region is formed. At an even larger positive bias, the band bending becomes so large that the Fermi level at the interface of the semiconductor and the insulator becomes closer {{to the bottom of the}} conduction band than to the top of the valence band, therefore, it forms an inversion layer of electrons, providing the conducting channel. Finally, it turns the device on.|$|E

We apply the procedure to a structural transition in a cluster and to the migration of a crystalline defect along a reaction coordinate. We observe that the proposed average speeds up the convergence of the adaptive biasing force towards the mean force along the external parameter, compared to simulations using the standard conditional expectation. The proposed procedure is also able to iteratively construct a <b>biasing</b> <b>potential</b> fully compensating the free energy along the reaction coordinate with two practical advantages over standard adaptive procedures: (i) the second derivatives of the reaction coordinate are not needed, (ii) no <b>biasing</b> <b>potential</b> is differentiated to generate the dynamics...|$|R

These properties depend on the sputtering parameters. The substrate temperature during deposition is found to have the most important influence on the crystallinity. High energy on the substrate achieved by means of an Argon bombardment under a <b>bias</b> <b>potential</b> of ‚Äì 70 V produces a large crystallinity of the Fe 89 Co 11 material.

40|$|Hydrogen bonds play an {{important}} role in stabilizing (meta-) stable states in protein folding. Hence, they can potentially be used as a way to bias these states in molecular simulation methods. Previously, Wolf et al. showed that applying repulsive and attractive hydrogen bond <b>biasing</b> <b>potentials</b> in an alternating way significantly accelerates the folding process (Wolf, M. G.; de Leeuw, S. W. Biophys. J. 2008, 94, 3742). As the <b>biasing</b> <b>potentials</b> are only active during a fixed time interval, this alternating scheme does not represent a thermodynamic equilibrium. In this work, we present a Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) scheme that aims to shuffle and reorder hydrogen bonds in the protein backbone. We therefore apply adapted hydrogen bond potentials in a Hamiltonian REMD scheme, which we call hydrogen bond switching (HS). To compare the performance of the HS to a standard REMD method, we performed HS and temperature REMD simulations of a Œ≤-heptapeptide in methanol. Both methods sample the conformational space to a similar extent. As the HS simulation required only five replicas, while the REMD simulation required 20 replicas, the HS method is significantly more efficient. We tested the HS method also on a larger system, 16 -residue polyalanine in water. Both of the simulations starting from a completely unfolded and a folded conformation resulted in an ensemble with, apart from the starting structure, similar conformational minima. We can conclude that the HS method provides an efficient way to sample the conformational space of a protein, without requiring knowledge of the folded states beforehand. In addition, these simulations revealed that convergence was hampered by replicas having a preference for specific <b>biasing</b> <b>potentials.</b> As this sorting effect is inherent to any Hamiltonian REMD method, finding a solution will result in an additional increase in the efficiency of Hamiltonian REMD methods in general...|$|R

40|$|Using the tight-binding approach, we {{investigate}} the electronic properties of bilayer phosphorene (BLP) quantum dots (QDs) {{in the presence}} of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields. Since BLP consists of two coupled phosphorene layers, it is of interest to examine the layer-dependent electronic properties of BLP QDs, such as the electronic distributions over the two layers and the so-produced layer-polarization features, and to see how these properties are affected by the magnetic field and the <b>bias</b> <b>potential.</b> We find that {{in the absence of a}} <b>bias</b> <b>potential</b> only edge states are layer-polarized while the bulk states are not, and the layer-polarization degree (LPD) of the unbiased edge states increases with increasing magnetic field. However, {{in the presence of}} a <b>bias</b> <b>potential</b> both the edge and bulk states are layer-polarized, and the LPD of the bulk (edge) states depends strongly (weakly) on the interplay of the <b>bias</b> <b>potential</b> and the interlayer coupling.

In this paper, we extend the result to {{cases in which the}} <b>biased</b> <b>potential,</b> the line tension, and the pinning energy of the line are all functions of position. Although an evaluation of the exact correlated creep velocity is difficult, a good approximate form can be found. We show that the Anderson-Kim thermal-activation formula in the vortex-creep model is still valid after suitable modification even though their uncorrelated-creeping assumption is incorrect. We apply our formalism to study the motion of vortex lines in the crustal region of neutron stars. The model results suggests that the steady-state configuration of vortex lines should form a set of hyperbolic-like curves because the stronger-pinning regions (which also have higher tension) are located in the inner regions of the crust. Perturbations, like a star quake, can cause a large number of vortex lines to unpin from the stronger-pinning region and the tension forces the vortex lines to move by a macroscopic distance. Such a mechanism may be responsible for the glitches of pulsars. ¬© 1993 The American Physical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
