5|$|As {{preparations}} {{were made}} for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling {{to compete with the}} volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly <b>bored</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> routine of performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they decided to make the August tour their last.|$|E
5|$|Bart and his catchphrase {{continue}} to be popular, while Krusty creates {{a wide array of}} merchandise featuring Bart's likeness. Bart becomes sick of his fame and begins to fear that the fad will wear off, so he tries to expand his act and personality during an interview on Conan O'Brien's late-night talk show, to no avail. Bart decides to stop performing, but Marge convinces him that he should continue because he makes people happy. Bart arrives at Krusty's show and enthusiastically delivers his line, but the audience is <b>bored</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> line and does not react. With fans no longer interested in Bart, Krusty ditches him.|$|E
5|$|Grayburn was {{promoted}} to war substantive lieutenant in 1942 and married Marcelle Chambers, {{with whom he had}} a son, in the same year. However, the Ox and Bucks remained on the home front and Grayburn became <b>bored</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> inactivity. Instead he applied to the Parachute Regiment and in June 1943 he was transferred to the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion. The following year he was transferred to the regiment's 2nd Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Frost, and took command of 2 Platoon, A Company.|$|E

5|$|Waugh {{began at}} Heatherley's in late September 1924, but became <b>bored</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> routine and quickly {{abandoned}} his course. He spent weeks partying in London and Oxford before the overriding need for money {{led him to}} apply through an agency for a teaching job. Almost at once, he secured a post at Arnold House, a boys' preparatory school in North Wales, beginning in January 1925. He took with him the notes for his novel, The Temple at Thatch, intending {{to work on it}} in his spare time. Despite the gloomy ambience of the school, Waugh did his best to fulfil the requirements of his position, but a brief return to London and Oxford during the Easter holiday only exacerbated his sense of isolation.|$|E
25|$|The {{massacre}} of St Bartholomew — occurring {{as he was}} about to accompany the bishop of Valence on an embassy to Poland — made Scaliger flee, together with other Huguenots, for Geneva, where he was appointed a professor in the academy.

Dagny is confronted by Ellis Wyatt, a Colorado oil man angry to be forced to do business with Taggart Transcontinental. Dagny promises him that he will get the service he needs. Dagny encounters former lover Francisco d'Anconia, who presents a façade of a playboy grown <b>bored</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pursuit of money.

25|$|<b>Bored</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{inactivity}} {{of the new}} U.S. Senate, Burr ran for and {{was elected}} to the New York State Assembly, serving from 1798 through 1799. During this time, he cooperated with the Holland Land Company in gaining passage of a law to permit aliens to hold and convey lands. During John Adams' term as president, national parties became clearly defined. Burr loosely associated with the Democratic-Republicans, though he had moderate Federalist allies, such as Sen. Jonathan Dayton of New Jersey. Burr quickly became a key player in New York politics, more powerful in time than Hamilton. This was due largely {{to the power of the}} Tammany Society, later to become the infamous Tammany Hall. Burr converted it from a social club into a political machine, particularly in populous New York City, to help Jefferson reach the presidency.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{analysis}} of vibrations on surface roughness generated during <b>boring</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> application of the conventional boring tool and one <b>with</b> <b>the</b> damper is presented. The experiments included the measurement of vibration accelerations carried out <b>with</b> <b>the</b> piezoelectric sensor, {{as well as the}} evaluation of surface roughness parameters after each machining pass. The obtained results reveal that in the investigated range, no stability loss was found. Furthermore, the growth of the rotational speed induces the increase of vibration level, as well as the growth {{of the differences between the}} vibration values generated during <b>boring</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> conventional tool and one equipped with damper. Vibrations have also the direct influence on the machined surface roughness. In case of <b>the</b> tool equipped <b>with</b> <b>the</b> damper, the tool’s overhang L had more intense influence than rotational speed n. However, for the conventional boring tool this dependency was unequivocal...|$|R

25|$|Both William and Anne {{appointed}} {{and dismissed}} Cabinet members, attended meetings, made decisions, and {{followed up on}} actions. Relieving the Sovereign of these responsibilities and gaining control over the Cabinet's composition was {{an essential part of}} evolution of the Premiership. This process began after the Hanoverian Succession. Although George I (1714–1727) attended Cabinet meetings at first, after 1717 he withdrew because he did not speak fluent English and was <b>bored</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> discussions. George II (1727–1760) occasionally presided at Cabinet meetings but his grandson, George III (1760–1820), is known to have attended only two during his 60-year reign. Thus, the convention that Sovereigns do not attend Cabinet meetings was established primarily through royal indifference to the everyday tasks of governance. The Prime Minister became responsible for calling meetings, presiding, taking notes, and reporting to the Sovereign. These simple executive tasks naturally gave the Prime Minister ascendancy over his Cabinet colleagues.|$|E
25|$|After the war Johnston {{struggled}} {{to make a living}} for himself and his wife, who was ailing. He became president of a small railroad, the Alabama and Tennessee River Rail Road Company, which during his tenure of May 1866 to November 1867, was renamed the Selma, Rome and Dalton Railroad. Johnston was <b>bored</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> position and the company failed for lack of capital. He established in 1868 an insurance company in Savannah, Georgia, acting as an agent for the Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company, and within four years had a network of more than 120 agents across the deep South. The income from this venture allowed him to devote time to his great postwar activity, writing his memoirs. His Narrative of Military Operations, published in 1874, was highly critical of Davis and many of his fellow generals, continuing his grievance about the unfairness of his ranking as a general and attempting to justify his career as a cautious campaigner. The book sold poorly and its publisher failed to make a profit.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{remained}} as Wright's chief assistant for one year, he soon became <b>bored</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> work. He became concerned that [...] "the design had {{nothing in common}} with Japan, its climate, its traditions, its people and its culture". Also, whilst his work with Gilbert showed him the great possibilities of concrete, Wright did not see concrete in the same way, preferring to encase it with brickwork or carved Oya Stone.|$|E

25|$|A {{tidal bore}} is a {{hydraulic}} jump which {{occurs when the}} incoming tide forms a wave (or waves) of water that travel up a river or narrow bay against {{the direction of the}} current. As is true for hydraulic jumps in general, bores take on various forms depending upon the difference in the waterlevel upstream and down, ranging from an undular wavefront to a shock-wave-like wall of water. Figure 3 shows a tidal <b>bore</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> characteristics common to shallow upstream water – a large elevation difference is observed. Figure 4 shows a tidal <b>bore</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> characteristics common to deep upstream water – a small elevation difference is observed and the wavefront undulates. In both cases the tidal wave moves at the speed characteristic of waves in water of the depth found immediately behind the wave front. A key feature of tidal bores and positive surges is the intense turbulent mixing induced by the passage of the bore front and by the following wave motion.|$|R
