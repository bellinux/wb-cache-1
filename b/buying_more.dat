He favored <b>buying</b> <b>more</b> National Forest lands, reforestation, fire protection for forests via the Clarke–McNary Act, and farm support. Although vetoed by President Calvin Coolidge, the McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill was the forerunner of the farm legislation of the New Deal.|$|E

While other Indian mills produced cheap coarse yarn (and later cloth) using local short-staple cotton and cheap machinery imported from Britain, Tata did much better by importing expensive longer-stapled cotton from Egypt and <b>buying</b> <b>more</b> complex ring-spindle machinery from the United States to spin finer yarn that could compete with imports from Britain.|$|E

Analogous to the consumer trend for oversized houses is the trend towards buying oversized light-trucks, specifically the off-road sport-utility vehicle type (cf. station wagon and estate car), as a form of psychologically comforting conspicuous consumption, because such big motor-vehicles usually are bought by people who reside in a city, an urban nuclear family.|$|E
25|$|When he was 19, Seldes {{went to work}} at the Pittsburgh Leader. An early {{scoop of}} his for this paper was when two-time presidential {{candidate}} William Jennings Bryan expelled Seldes from Bryan's hotel room. He also interviewed a saleswoman who had filed a rape complaint against the son of the owner on a large department store, but the story was not published, and Seldes became outraged when the advertising department of the newspaper blackmailed the owner into <b>buying</b> <b>more</b> advertising. In 1914, he was appointed night editor of the Pittsburgh Post. As a young journalist, he was influenced by the investigative journalism of muckraker Lincoln Steffens, whom he met in 1919.|$|E

5000|$|Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) is {{the manager}} of the <b>Buy</b> <b>More,</b> {{beginning}} in season 4. Many side plots taking place at <b>Buy</b> <b>More</b> revolve around him, in large part due to his close friendship with Chuck, to whom many employees look for leadership. As a Green Shirt in the first two seasons, he chafes under any marginally restrictive rules even when they didn't affect him, extends his [...] "mad work avoidance skills" [...] to lead the other non-managerial staff in goofing off, and is a particularly poor salesman, leading to frequent conflicts with management. Morgan later accepts promotion to assistant manager by Emmett to hold the store together and keep Emmett from firing everyone. Morgan quits the <b>Buy</b> <b>More</b> with the encouragement of Anna Wu, and asks her to accompany him to Hawaii. He later returns without her, after which Big Mike promotes him back to assistant manager. Morgan learns of Chuck's spy life after discovering one of the secret entrances to Castle from the <b>Buy</b> <b>More,</b> and is later made a member of Team Bartowski by General Beckman, (at Casey's insistence) who directs him to keep the <b>Buy</b> <b>More</b> job as cover. [...] Morgan loses his <b>Buy</b> <b>More</b> job when the store is incinerated by Daniel Shaw's bomb.

25|$|A {{pioneer farmer}} had five sacks of grain, {{with no way}} of selling them or <b>buying</b> <b>more.</b> He had five {{possible}} uses: as basic feed for himself, food to build strength, food for his chickens for dietary variation, an ingredient for making whisky and feed for his parrots to amuse him. Then the farmer lost one sack of grain. Instead of reducing every activity by a fifth, the farmer simply starved the parrots as they were of less utility than the other four uses; in other words {{they were on the}} margin. And it is on the margin, and not with a view to the big picture, that we make economic decisions.|$|E
25|$|The ongoing {{demand for}} well-educated workers {{continued}}. Housing prices {{in urban areas}} continued to increase so that a modest home that in the 1960s cost $25,000, cost {{half a million dollars}} or more in urban areas by 2005. More people commuted longer hours to afford a home in more rural areas while earning larger salaries in the urban areas. Speculators bought houses they never intended to live in, expecting to make a huge profit in a matter of months, then rolling it over by <b>buying</b> <b>more</b> properties. Mortgage companies were compliant, as everyone assumed the prices would keep rising. The bubble burst in 2007-8 as housing prices began to crash and the boom years ended. Hundreds of billions in property values vanished and foreclosures soared as many financial institutions and investors were badly hurt.|$|E
25|$|By 1820 the navigations had {{fixed the}} worst of the barging issues, a road from the mines was {{systematically}} being improved easing the teamster's problems and the ventures began to make substantial money; by 1822 the two companies were combined into the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company and both the navigational works and the mule road were re-routed so they reached Mauch Chunk, the mule road high enough to dump coal by chutes into barges on the town's quay. By 1824 the company was flush with cash, had been further improving the lower river with two way locks and seeking other sources, began <b>buying</b> <b>more</b> coal lands and eventually bought lands around Hazleton and Ashley and the saddle shaped mountain pass above at Penobscot, Pennsylvania (now Mountain Top) above both south Wilkes-Barre on the Susquehanna and White Haven on the Lehigh {{at the head of the}} gorge.|$|E

25|$|Tayloe’s son, William Henry, {{took over}} Mount Airy in 1828, and its slave {{population}} continued to increase, even as depleted soil led to crop shortfalls and declining profits. So where the Barhams responded to their demographic crisis by <b>buying</b> <b>more</b> slaves and intensifying production, the new master of Mount Airy opted for expansion. He struck out west with his brothers, acquiring cotton fields in Alabama. Between 1833 and 1862, William Henry moved {{a total of}} 218 slaves from white-fenced Virginia to the Cotton South’s slave frontier, a distance of 800 miles. Many of these captives were teenagers, “of the right age {{to learn how to}} pick cotton.” By this point, with the Atlantic slave trade closed, Virginia had become a net slave exporter; in the early 19th century, there were fewer than a million enslaved people in the United States, mostly concentrated in the coastal and piedmont South. Four decades later, there were four times as many, spread from Charleston to Texas, from Mount Airy to west-central Alabama, where William Henry Tayloe established his new estates.|$|E

In November 1926, he drove to Lansing and bought two boxes of dynamite at a sporting goods store.

500|$|According to Sally Jenkins, in her Sports Illustrated {{article on}} Carlisle:To take {{advantage}} of the Indians' versatility Warner drew up a new offense... "the Carlisle formation," [...] but later it would be known as the single wing. It was predicated on one small move: Warner shifted a halfback out wide, to outflank the opposing tackle, forming something that looked like a wing. It opened up a world of possibilities. The Indians could line up as if to punt – and then throw. No one would know whether they were going to run, pass or kick. For added measure Warner taught his quarterbacks to sprint out a few yards to their left or their right, <b>buying</b> <b>more</b> time to throw. The rest of the players flooded downfield and knocked down any opponent who might be able to intercept or bat away the pass.|$|E

500|$|According to David Prior, {{producer}} of the subsequent two-disc special edition, the initial bare bones edition [...] "was only reluctantly agreed to by Fincher because I needed {{more time on the}} bonus material. The studio was locked into their release date, so Fincher allowed that version to be released first. It {{had nothing to do with}} Fincher 'double dipping his own movie before it even makes it to stores' and everything to do with <b>buying</b> <b>more</b> time for the special edition". He stated that the theatrical cut would only be available on the single-disc edition. Prior elaborated further: [...] "Nobody wants fans feeling like they're being taken advantage of, and I know that double-dipping creates that impression. That's why it was so important to me that consumers be told there was another version coming. In this case it really was a rock-and-a-hard-place situation, and delaying the second release was done strictly for the benefit of the final product... But this is a very ambitious project, easily the most far-reaching I've ever worked on, and owing largely to studio snafus that I can't really elaborate on, I didn't have enough time to do it properly. Thus Fincher bought me the extra time by agreeing to a staggered release, which I'm very grateful for". [...] In its first week, rentals for the DVD earned $6.7 million.|$|E
