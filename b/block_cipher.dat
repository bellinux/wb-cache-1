50|$|After the two attacks, {{differential}} cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis, were presented on <b>block</b> <b>ciphers,</b> some new <b>block</b> <b>ciphers</b> were introduced, which were proven secure against differential and linear attacks.

40|$|Abstract. We revisit meet-in-the-middle (MITM) {{attacks on}} <b>block</b> <b>ciphers.</b> Despite recent {{significant}} improvements of the MITM attack, its application is still restrictive. In other words, {{most of the}} recent MITM attacks work only on <b>block</b> <b>ciphers</b> consisting of a bit permutation based key schedule such as KTANTAN, GOST, IDEA, XTEA, LED and Piccolo. In this paper, we extend the MITM attack {{so that it can}} be applied to a wider class of <b>block</b> <b>ciphers.</b> In our approach, MITM attacks on <b>block</b> <b>ciphers</b> consisting of a complex key schedule can be constructed. We regard all subkeys as independent variables, then transform the game that finds the user-provided key to the game that finds all independent subkeys. We apply our approach called all subkeys recovery (ASR) attack to <b>block</b> <b>ciphers</b> employing a complex key schedule such as CAST- 128, SHACAL- 2, KATAN, FOX 128 and Blowfish, and present the best attacks on them with respect to the number of attacked rounds in literature.

25|$|While DES was {{designed}} with resistance to differential cryptanalysis in mind, other contemporary ciphers {{proved to be}} vulnerable. An early target for the attack was the FEAL <b>block</b> <b>cipher.</b> The original proposed version with four rounds (FEAL-4) can be broken using only eight chosen plaintexts, and even a 31-round version of FEAL is susceptible to the attack. In contrast, the scheme can successfully cryptanalyze DES with an effort on the order 247 chosen plaintexts.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{cryptanalysis}} is {{a general}} form of cryptanalysis applicable primarily to block ciphers, but also to stream ciphers and cryptographic hash functions. In the broadest sense, it {{is the study of}} how differences in information input can affect the resultant difference at the output. In the case of a <b>block</b> <b>cipher,</b> it refers to a set of techniques for tracing differences through the network of transformation, discovering where the cipher exhibits non-random behavior, and exploiting such properties to recover the secret key (cryptography key).|$|E

The selection was based on Camellia's high reputation for ease of procurement, and security and performance features comparable to those of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
