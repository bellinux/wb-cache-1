5|$|Afterwards, Alexander {{travelled}} to Ecbatana {{to retrieve}} {{the bulk of the}} Persian treasure. There, his closest friend and possible lover, Hephaestion, died of illness or poisoning. Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander, and he ordered the preparation of an expensive funeral pyre in Babylon, as well as a decree for public mourning. Back in Babylon, Alexander planned a series of new campaigns, beginning with an invasion of Arabia, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have a chance to realize them, as he died shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In early 1257, Aybak {{was killed}} in a conspiracy, and was succeeded by his 15-year-old son, al-Mansur Ali, while Saif ad-Din Qutuz held an {{influential}} position. Soon after al-Mansur Ali's ascendancy rumors of another conspiracy to which an-Nasir Yusuf had an alleged connection emerged. The accused conspirator, al-Mansur Ali's vizier, Sharaf ad-Din al-Fa'izi, was strangled by Egyptian authorities. The Bahri Mamluks in Syria led by Baibars pressured an-Nasir Yusuf to intervene by invading Egypt, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> act, fearing the Bahri dynasty would usurp his throne if they gained Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Growing up, Bueno {{worked as}} a paperboy at the {{newsstand}} of his grandmother, Hortensia. In 1984, he attended concerts of the local band Chébere and was occasionally invited to join them on stage. The next year, {{he dropped out of}} school and started working at his father's record shop, where he sometimes sang for the customers. A friend of his father belonged to the local band Manto Negro and offered Rodrigo a spot in the band. This is where he formally started his career in music, signing his first contract and earning his first salary as a musician at age thirteen. Bueno had written songs since the age of ten, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> show them to his colleagues because of his grammar mistakes.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, Wilder {{relocated}} to Paris, accepting {{a leading role}} in Bud Yorkin's Start the Revolution Without Me, a comedy that took place during the French Revolution. After shooting ended, Wilder returned to New York, where he read the script for Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx and immediately called Sidney Glazier, who produced The Producers. Both men began searching for the perfect director for the film. Jean Renoir was the first candidate, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{be able to do the}} film for at least a year, so British-Indian director Waris Hussein was hired. With Margot Kidder co-starring with Wilder, it was filmed on location in Dublin, and at the nearby Ardmore Studios, in August and September 1969.|$|E
5|$|On March 18, 2003, Owumi {{signed a}} letter of intent to play college {{football}} for Georgetown. He joined the team on a scholarship under head coach Bob Benson, uncertain of his future in basketball. Although Owumi had initially desired to play the quarterback position, his coaches wanted him to play wide receiver due to his athletic abilities. He later moved to being a safety and eventually became the Hoyas' third-string quarterback, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> officially play the position. Following the football season, Owumi often practiced with the school's basketball team but never joined. He decided to transfer out of Georgetown to focus on academics and basketball, retaining his four years of college basketball eligibility.|$|E
5|$|Brimsek {{started the}} 1938–39 {{season with the}} Reds, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> stay long with them. During an NHL {{exhibition}} game, Thompson got injured and {{it was unlikely that}} Thompson would recuperate in time for the beginning of the regular season. Needing a replacement, Brimsek was called up by the Bruins. In his NHL debut, Brimsek helped his team defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs by a score of 3–2. He started in net for one more game, a 4–1 victory against the Red Wings, before being sent back down to the Reds as Thompson recovered. Art Ross, the Bruins' coach and general manager, had seen enough of Brimsek during his two stints in Boston to contemplate promoting Brimsek full-time with the Bruins. Thompson was traded to the Detroit Red Wings for goaltender Normie Smith and $15,000.00 U.S. cash on November 16, 1938, after playing only five games with the Bruins. Ross then proceeded to promote Brimsek as the team's new starting goalie. This did not sit well with Bruins fans as Thompson was a favorite and he was the reigning Vezina Trophy winner.|$|E

5|$|In late 1832, the Democratic Party {{convention}} nominated Pierce {{for one of}} New Hampshire's five {{seats in}} the U.S. House of Representatives. This was tantamount to election for the young Democrat, as the National Republicans had faded as a political force, while the Whigs had not yet begun to attract a large following. Democratic strength in New Hampshire was also bolstered by Jackson's landslide re-election that year. New Hampshire had been a marginal state politically, but from 1832 through the mid-1850s became the most reliably Democratic state in the North, boosting Pierce's political career. Pierce's term began in March 1833, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be sworn in until Congress met in December, and his attention was elsewhere. He had recently become engaged and bought his first house in Hillsborough. Franklin and Benjamin Pierce were among the prominent citizens who welcomed President Jackson to the state on his visit in mid-1833.|$|E
5|$|One of Frederick III's bodyguards, Statius, {{traveled}} to Scania {{to organize the}} peasants into Snapphane units and instigate anti-Swedish sentiment. In Malmö, a cabal of rich bourgeoisie, led by Bartholomaeus Mikkelsen, planned a revolt. The conspiracy tried to recruit one of Malmös two mayors, Efvert Wiltfang, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> commit himself to the uprising, even though {{he said he would}} support Frederick III. At the end of December, the Danes embarked on a foray into Scania, but were foiled by bad weather and poor navigation. Meanwhile, the Swedish authorities had become aware of the plot and the main leaders were arrested, among them Mikkelsen and Wildfang, and the conspirators were sentenced to death. On December 22, 1659 Mikkelsen and two others were beheaded, but in an attempt to placate the Scanian people the execution of Wiltfang and 10 others was stayed. The uprising had been averted, but rebels and insurgents continued to operate in the countryside.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, after {{a disappointing}} 5–11 season, the Vikings bought out the {{contract}} of Dennis Green, despite his successful coaching tenure with the team. Mike Tice coached {{the final game}} of 2001, losing to the Ravens 19–3. Tice was named the permanent coach after the season, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> lead the Vikings back to the playoffs until 2004.|$|E

25|$|Reardon {{played his}} last {{competitive}} ranking match in the 1991 World Championship qualifying second round. He lost 10–5 to Jason Prince (losing three frames on the black). Upon this loss, Reardon announced that 'there was no bitterness on his part' <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be returning. Having slipped to 127th in the provisional ranking and now aged 58, Reardon called {{a halt to}} his formal playing career. Reardon's last formal appearance in an event came in the 2000 Senior's event where he lost his opening one-frame match 69–46 to Graham Miles.|$|E
25|$|When Lord Somerset, the Protector, invaded Scotland in {{the summer}} of 1547 and was absent from court, his brother, Thomas, fomented {{opposition}} to his authority, voicing open disapproval of his brother's administrative skills. Because his activities seemed suspicious, several members of the nobility advised him to be content with his position, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> listen. As Lord High Admiral, he was able to control the English navy, and he openly asked for support in case of a rebellion. He entered into relations with pirates on the western coasts, whom it was his duty as Lord High Admiral to suppress, with a view to securing their support. Thomas seems also to have hoped to finance a rebellion through crooked dealings with the vice-treasurer of the Bristol Mint, Sir William Sharington.|$|E
25|$|Assistant Commissioner Wong {{said the}} source of the {{pictures}} had been traced, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> confirm reports stating that they had been taken from Chen's computer. He added that the authenticity of the photographs was no longer in question. Wong also said of the six women found in the photographs, four were local celebrities and two were unknown to the police. None of the women were named. Wong was certain that no overseas artists were involved. He said that whilst it was not a crime to transfer the pictures to friends, those who had posted the images to Internet web pages could be in breach of the law. On 5 February, as another of the suspects was released on HK$50,000 bail, six more related photographs surfaced on the Internet. In the early hours on Chinese New Year's Eve, several hundred more photographs appeared on the Internet; there were two new faces.|$|E

25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War II and the Nazi invasion of Poland, Biłgoraj was bombed from the air {{and most of its}} residents fled. Rabbi Mordechai and his family followed the refugees to Poritsc, several kilometers north of Sokal, and then to Berezhany. Meanwhile, Belzer Hasidim in Israel, England and the United States arranged to spirit the Rebbe out of Belz to Sokal and then to Przemyslany, where he remained for nearly a year. With the onset of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941, Sokal, on the front lines, fell to the Germans on the first day; Prezemyslany was conquered by July 1. The Rebbe went into hiding and narrowly avoided capture by German patrols, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> escape further without his brother at his side. Rabbi Mordechai sent his wife and daughter to her father's house in Kobrin, while Rebbe Aharon's wife and five unmarried children stayed in Przemyslany under the care of one of his Hasidim. They were all subsequently murdered by the Nazis.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to giving Jackson an ultimatum to pick between sports, Buccaneers management took Jackson on owner Hugh Culverhouse's private jet {{to visit with}} the team during his senior baseball season. Jackson {{was told by the}} Buccaneers that the trip, which could have cost Jackson his remaining collegiate eligibility, had been cleared by the NCAA. Jackson was later told by his baseball coach at Auburn that the trip was considered to be a violation of NCAA rules and that he was immediately ruled ineligible to play the remainder of the baseball season. Jackson, upset that Culverhouse lied to him, insisted that he would never play for the Buccaneers and that they could draft him if he wanted to, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> sign if he was drafted. It was said that Jackson, who was having what he called his best year playing baseball in school, made the Buccaneers nervous and that by getting him somehow ruled ineligible to play baseball, he would be forced to focus on football.|$|E
25|$|The Grand Alliance {{had failed}} to make the decisive {{breakthrough}} in 1709, but Louis XIV was far from confident: his finances were in a mess and the famine lingered. At Geertruidenberg from March through July 1710 the French envoys, Marshal d'Uxelles and the Abbé Polignac, sought to modify the harsh Hague Preliminaries. Against Joseph I's wishes – whose objective remained the entire Spanish inheritance – the Dutch had suggested Philip V could retain Sicily, and perhaps receive Sardinia as compensation for vacating Spain. Yet the Allies now went even beyond the demands specified at The Hague. Prompted by their distrust of Louis XIV and convinced of France's exhaustion, the Dutch insisted Louis XIV take sole responsibility, in men and money, for driving Philip V from Spain if he refused to leave voluntarily. This was flatly rejected. Louis XIV had already recalled much of his army from Spain to promote the peace process, and he was even willing to pay a large subsidy to assist the Allied campaign in the peninsula. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> send French troops to depose his grandson while his enemies watched from afar.|$|E
