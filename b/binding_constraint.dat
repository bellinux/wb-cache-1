40|$|The {{severity}} of <b>binding</b> <b>constraints</b> to trade expansion {{in developing countries}} {{and the importance of}} the complementary policies that will maximize the impact of trade reforms on trade and economic growth are identified and quantified in this report. As trade-related needs of developing countries are numerous, such quantification is needed to identify the most <b>binding</b> <b>constraints</b> to guide the sequencing of reforms and aid-for-trade interventions. The constraints to trade expansion are largely country specific. However, countries which share important characteristics may face similar <b>binding</b> <b>constraints.</b> An econometric analysis is undertaken for as many partner countries as possible to produce an sample. that {{can be used as a}} benchmark against which special country groupings can be assessed. The econometric work relies on experimentation to identify and rank (based on their relative severity) the most <b>binding</b> <b>constraints</b> for each country grouping.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for estimating non-linear dynamic models, including those featuring occasionally <b>binding</b> <b>constraints.</b> The algorithm extends the Cubature Kalman Filter of Arasaratnam and Haykin (2009) with dynamic state space reduction, to give adequate speed {{in the presence}} of occasionally <b>binding</b> <b>constraints,</b> and to ensure that it can handle the large state spaces generated by pruned perturbation solutions to medium-scale DSGE models. We further extend the base algorithm to allow for alternative cubature procedures to improve the tracking of non-linearities. The algorithm relies on the solution method for models with occasionally <b>binding</b> <b>constraints</b> of Holden (2016 b).

In this paper we take four common examples of occasionally <b>binding</b> <b>constraints</b> in economics and demonstrate how to use regime-switching to incorporate them into DSGE models. In particular we investigate the zero lower bound constraint on interest rates, occasionally <b>binding</b> collateral <b>constraints,</b> downward nominal wage rigidities and irreversible investment. We compare our approach against some well-known methods for solving occasionally-binding constraints. We demonstrate the versatility of our regime-switching approach by combining multiple occasionally <b>binding</b> <b>constraints</b> to a model solved using higher-order perturbation methods, a feat that is di cult to achieve using alternative methodologies...|$|R

50|$|In {{considering}} {{the subject of}} “side selling” the FAO publication advocates a combination of favourable incentives and explicit penalties for farmers. It also notes that in some circumstances the costs of full avoidance of contractual breaches can be much greater than losses from side-selling, and that companies may therefore {{learn to live with}} side-selling. This will depend {{on the size of the}} firm and the amount invested in farmers. Drawing in detail from the case studies, the publication reiterates the importance of a suitable enabling environment. However, it also concludes that in certain cases the lack of such an environment is not necessarily a <b>binding</b> <b>constraint</b> to contract farming, particularly where flexibility and non-conventional contractual clauses can be used. Although an enabling environment is important, the editors caution against government incentives and subsidies to promote inclusion as these may give a misleading impression of profitability and jeopardize sustainability. They also note that the costs to the firm of pursuing an inclusive strategy are rarely considered by proponents of the concept.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the first}} {{applications}} of the growth diagnostics methodology was {{a case study of}} El Salvador, described in the paper [...] "Growth Diagnostics", co-authored by Dani Rodrik and Andrès Velasco. At the time, the country had good macroeconomic indicators, decent institutions, low interest rates and returns to education. However, it was investing little. According to the authors, the growth diagnostics methodology revealed that in the end, the low investment in El Salvador could be brought back to a problem of self-discovery: the country was losing its traditional industries and it was unclear what it should invest in next. This lack of innovative investment ideas, then, was El Salvador's most <b>binding</b> <b>constraint</b> on growth. Since the publication of this paper, the growth diagnostics strategy has been adopted by a number of international institutions including the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the UK’s Department for International Development and the Millennium Challenge Corporation.

30|$|Findings {{point out}} that the most <b>binding</b> <b>constraint</b> is related to poor {{provision}} of public goods by the government. This is indicated by micro-risk factors such as unfair competitive practices, rule of law, and high levels of corruption. These outcomes indicate that improvement in provision of public goods would produce bigger change in the objective function. The second <b>binding</b> <b>constraint</b> is related to the cost of finance. This constraint is partly related to the macro- and microeconomic risk factors. Specific symptoms have been discerned in relation to the high cost of finance. The evidence indicates that factors that encourage the high cost of finance are related to the low level of domestic savings, monopolistic behaviour of banks, and poor access on international finance. The third <b>binding</b> <b>constraint</b> is related to complementary factors, particularly to poor availability of human capital.|$|E
