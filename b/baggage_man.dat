6000|$|... "Well, to {{tell the}} truth, your people seemed more lively and {{generally}} human than I have ever seen them. The <b>baggage</b> <b>man</b> set out to tell me a funny story, and that's a new experience for me in this country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Parkins, [...] "the head <b>baggage</b> <b>man</b> (he wears a uniform, you know, in Italy {{just like}} a soldier) {{said it was because}} we'd {{forgotten}} to check them in Vienna. However there we were waiting for twenty-four hours with nothing but our valises." ...|$|E
60|$|Stuyvesant {{wondered}} whether the <b>baggage</b> <b>men</b> would remember to transfer his trunk to the new train, without his attending to it, but as he observed that the other passengers did nothing about their trunks, but went at once into the new cars, he concluded that {{he had nothing to}} do but follow their example.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, if {{you will}} point out your <b>baggage,</b> my <b>man</b> will see it taken up to your rooms; and you can come {{straight}} on to me. Carrie has got supper ready, and a big fire blazing. It is not three minutes' walk from here." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{then walked}} down to the river, and found the black {{corporal}} sitting tranquilly by the side of his <b>baggage.</b> The <b>man</b> stood up and saluted, and on Gregory saying that he had now a house, at once told off two soldiers to carry the things.|$|R
60|$|Everything {{that he did}} showed this. He {{gave the}} <b>baggage</b> <b>man</b> twenty-five cents to take the check off his trunk, the 'bus driver fifty cents to drive {{him up to the}} Main Street, and he went into Callahan's tobacco store and bought two ten-cent cigars and took them across the street and gave them to Mallory Tompkins of the Times-Herald as a present from the Prime Minister.|$|E
60|$|All day we loitered along {{beautiful}} wood roads, passing wonderful old homesteads {{gray and}} mossy, sheltered by trees that were almost human in the clasp of their protecting arms. We paused beside bright streams, and drank at mossy wells operated by rude and ancient sweeps, contrivances {{which we had}} seen only in pictures. It was all beautiful, but we got no work. The next day, having spent our last cent in railway tickets, we rode to Ayer Junction, where we left our trunks in care of the <b>baggage</b> <b>man</b> and resumed our tramping.|$|E
6000|$|After parting {{with the}} {{scarecrow}} Mr. Lavender who felt uncommonly hungry' {{was about to}} despair of finding any German prisoners when he saw before him a gravel-pit, and three men working therein. Clad in dungaree, and very dusty, they had a cast of countenance so unmistakably Teutonic that Mr. Lavender stood still. They paid little or no attention to him, however, but went on sadly and silently with their work, which was that of sifting gravel. Mr. Lavender {{sat down on a}} milestone opposite, and his heart contracted within him. [...] "They look very thin and sad," [...] he thought, [...] "I should not like to be a prisoner myself far from my country, {{in the midst of a}} hostile population, without a woman or a dog to throw me a wag of the tail. Poor men! For though it is necessary to hate the Germans, it seems impossible to forget that we are all human beings. This is weakness," [...] he added to himself, [...] "which no editor would tolerate for a moment. I must fight against it if I am to fulfil my duty of rousing the population to the task of starving them. How hungry they look already--their checks are hollow! I must be firm. Perhaps they have wives and families at home, thinking of them at this moment. But, after all, they are Huns. What did the great writer say? 'Vermin--creatures no more worthy of pity than the tiger or the rat.' How true! And yet--Blink!" [...] For his dog, seated on her haunches, was looking at him with that peculiarly steady gaze which betokened in her the desire for food. [...] "Yes," [...] mused Mr. Lavender, [...] "pity is the mark of the weak man. It is a vice which was at one time rampant in this country; the war has made one beneficial change at least--we are moving more and more towards the manly and unforgiving vigour of the tiger and the rat. To be brutal! This is the one lesson that the Germans can teach us, for we had almost forgotten the art. What danger we were in! Thank God, we have past masters again among us now!" [...] A frown became fixed between his brows. [...] "Yes, indeed, past masters. How I venerate those good journalists and all the great crowd of witnesses who have dominated the mortal weakness, pity. 'The Hun must and shall be destroyed--root and branch--hip and thigh--bag and <b>baggage</b> <b>man,</b> woman, and babe--this is the sole duty of the great and humane British people. Roll up, ladies and gentlemen, roll up! Great thought--great language! And yet----" ...|$|E
60|$|This was {{the manner}} of our march: A mile or so ahead of us went a picket of eight or ten men mounted on the swiftest beasts, doubtless to give warning of any danger. Next, three or four hundred yards away, {{followed}} a body of about fifty Kendah, travelling in a double line, and behind these the <b>baggage</b> <b>men,</b> mounted like everyone else, and leading behind them strings of camels laden with water, provisions, tents of skin and all our goods, including the fifty rifles and the ammunition that Ragnall had brought from England. Then came we three white men and Hans, each of us riding as swift and fine a camel as Africa can breed. On our right {{at a distance of}} about half a mile, and also on our left, travelled other bodies of the Kendah of the same numerical strength as that ahead, while the rear was brought up by the remainder of the company who drove a number of spare camels.|$|R
60|$|The {{captain and}} his niece arrived {{early in the}} day at Glenford station. The captain engaged a little one-horse vehicle which had {{frequently}} brought people to the toll-gate, and informed the driver that there was no <b>baggage.</b> The <b>man,</b> gazing at Olive, but scarcely daring to raise his eyes to her face, proceeded with solemn tread toward his vehicle {{as if he had been}} leading the line in a funeral.|$|R
60|$|For {{three days}} after his arrival at Cawnpore General Havelock rested his troops, and {{occupied}} himself with restoring order in the town. Numbers of Sepoys were found in hiding, and these were, as soon as identified, all hung at once. On the third day Brigadier-General Neil arrived, with the two hundred and twenty men of the Eighty-fourth, who had been hurried forward-a most welcome reinforcement, for Havelock's force was sadly weakened by loss in battle, sunstroke, and disease. On the 20th the army marched against Bithoor, every heart beating {{at the thought of}} engaging Nana Sahib, who, with five thousand men and a large number of cannon, had made every preparation for the defense of his castle. At the approach of the avenging force, however, his courage, and the courage of his troops, alike gave way, and they fled without firing a shot, leaving behind them guns, elephants, <b>baggage,</b> <b>men,</b> and horses, in great numbers. The magazine was blown up, and the palace burned, and the force, with their captured booty, returned to Cawnpore.|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the more}} {{exciting}} stories {{is that of the}} missing financial records for United Copper. In June 1909, Heinze, his brother Arthur P Heinze, and Carlos Warfield (President of the Ohio Copper Company) were indicted for spiriting away the books and correspondence of United Copper. Secret service men trailed the United Copper men with their luggage trunks full of company books. The trunks journeyed from New York to New Jersey and back and then one of the men tried to take a trunk to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, but the railway <b>baggage</b> <b>man</b> would not accept the 378 pounds trunk. The trunks were eventually found in a basement on West Fifty-Fifth Street in New York. Two further trunks were missing but Heinze promised to the judge that he would find them! ...|$|E

60|$|Soult reached Orense on the 20th, without guns, stores, ammunition, or <b>baggage,</b> his <b>men</b> {{exhausted}} {{with fatigue}} and misery, {{most of them}} shoeless, and some without muskets. He had left Orense seventy-six days before with 22,000 men, and had lately been joined by 3,500 from Tuy. He returned with 19,500, having lost 6,000 by sword, sickness, assassination, and capture. Of these 3,600 were taken in the hospitals at Oporto, Chaves, Vianna, and Braga. One thousand {{were killed in the}} advance, and the remainder captured or killed within the last eight days.|$|R
25|$|Custer's troopers {{continued}} to advance toward Appomattox Court House until they encountered infantry in their path.

The captured material included between 24 and 30 guns and about 150 to 200 wagons, mostly filled with <b>baggage.</b> Custer's <b>men</b> took almost 1,000 prisoners, including Brigadier General Young Marshall Moody who was ill and riding in a hospital wagon. On the other hand, Walker's men saved about 75 cannons during the battle and their retreat.|$|R
5000|$|According to MGM's {{dialogue}} cutting {{continuity and}} Leonard Maltin's audio {{commentary on the}} current DVD release, the film originally began (after the opening credits) {{with the image of}} a [...] "boat on canal". A superimposed title read, [...] "ITALY - WHERE THEY SING ALL DAY AND GO TO THE OPERA AT NIGHT", and was followed by a musical number featuring bits and pieces from Leoncavallo's Pagliacci performed by [...] "everyday" [...] Italians: a street sweeper sings part of the prologue ("Un nido di memorie...") as he greets a man who then hands out opera tickets to a group of children emerging from a store; the children respond with [...] "la-la-la-la-la, verso un paese strano" [...] (from [...] "Stridono lassù"); a [...] "captain" [...] comes down a set of steps, salutes a sentry, then bursts into [...] "Vesti la giubba"; then, a lap dissolve into a hotel lobby, where a [...] "baggage man" [...] is rolling a trunk and crooning about [...] "nettare divino" [...] ("divine nectar"); a waiter joins the <b>baggage</b> <b>man</b> in song, enters the dining room, and sings as he serves a man who for a few notes also sings; the waiter then crosses the dining room to speak to Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont), marking the beginning of the film in existing copies. Maltin stated the scene was cut during World War II to remove references to Italy, and unfortunately, the main negative was cut as well, so the scene is now lost.This notable cut, with several other small ones made at about the same time, is why the stated running time of the film (95 minutes) was three minutes longer than that of existing prints.|$|E

Up under the roof of the bellows-top there was a sash folded together and fastened up by straps. I unfastened one of the straps, and saw that I could let down the sash if I wished, and thus make a glass window in front of me, so as to shut me in nicely from the wind, if it should grow cold in the night.

60|$|The {{specimen}} I {{had obtained}} {{was a small}} one, about two feet high, weighing perhaps a hundredweight; {{and the next day}} we had it conveyed to Modjo-Kerto to await my return to Sourabaya. Having decided to stay some time at Wonosalem, on the lower slopes of the Arjuna Mountain, where I was informed I should find forest and plenty of game, I had first to obtain a recommendation from the Assistant Resident to the Regent, and then an order from the Regent to the Waidono; and when after a week's delay I arrived with my <b>baggage</b> and <b>men</b> at Modjo-agong, I found them all {{in the midst of a}} five days' feast, to celebrate the circumcision of the Waidono's younger brother and cousin, and had a small room in an on outhouse given me to stay in. The courtyard and the great open reception-shed were full of natives coming and going and making preparations for a feast which was to take place at midnight, to which I was invited, but preferred going to bed. A native band, or Gamelang, was playing almost all the evening, and I had a good opportunity of seeing the instruments and musicians. The former are chiefly gongs of various sizes, arranged in sets of from eight to twelve, on low wooden frames. Each set is played by one performer with one or two drumsticks. There are also some very large gongs, played singly or in pairs, and taking the place of our drums and kettledrums. Other instruments are formed by broad metallic bars, supported on strings stretched across frames; and others again of strips of bamboo similarly placed and producing the highest notes. Besides these there were a flute and a curious two-stringed violin, requiring in all twenty-four performers. There was a conductor, who led off and regulated the time, and each performer took his part, coming in occasionally with a few bars so as to form a harmonious combination. The pieces played were long and complicated, and some of the players were mere boys, who took their parts with great precision. The general effect was very pleasing, but, owing to the similarity of most of the instruments, more like a gigantic musical box than one of our bands; and in order to enjoy it thoroughly it is necessary to watch the large number of performers who are engaged in it. The next morning, while I was waiting for the men and horses who were to take me and my baggage to my destination, the two lads, who were about fourteen years old, were brought out, clothed in a sarong from the waist downwards, and having the whole body covered with yellow powder, and profusely decked with white blossom in wreaths, necklaces, and armlets, looking at first sight very like savage brides. They were conducted by two priests to a bench placed in front of the house in the open air, and the ceremony of circumcision was then performed before the assembled crowd.|$|R
