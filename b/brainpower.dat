Three universities with a major presence in the city, Harvard, MIT, and Tufts, are located just outside of Boston in the cities of Cambridge and Somerville, known as the <b>Brainpower</b> Triangle.

Its business, medical, dental, and public health schools are located in Boston's Allston and Longwood neighborhoods, and Harvard has plans for additional expansion into Allston.|$|E
25|$|Adams was a founder-director and Chief Fantasist of The Digital Village, {{a digital}} media and Internet company {{with which he}} created Starship Titanic, a Codie Award-winning and BAFTA-nominated {{adventure}} game, {{which was published in}} 1998 by Simon & Schuster. Terry Jones wrote the accompanying book, entitled Douglas Adams Starship Titanic, since Adams was too busy with the computer game to do both. In April 1999, Adams initiated the h2g2 collaborative writing project, an experimental attempt at making The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy a reality, and at harnessing the collective <b>brainpower</b> of the internet community. It was hosted by BBC Online from 2001 to 2011.|$|E

25|$|The {{editorial}} {{perspective of}} the corporate mass-media misrepresented intellectualism as a profession that is separate and apart from the jobs and occupations of regular folk. In presenting academically successful students as social failures, an undesirable social status for the average young man and young woman, corporate media established to the U.S. mainstream their opinion that the intellectualism of book-learning {{is a form of}} mental deviancy, thus, most people would shun intellectuals as friends, lest they risk social ridicule and ostracism. Hence, the popular acceptance of anti-intellectualism lead to populist rejection of the intelligentsia for resolving the problems of society. Moreover, in the book Inventing the Egghead: The Battle over <b>Brainpower</b> in American Culture (2013), Aaron Lecklider indicated that the contemporary ideological dismissal of the intelligentsia derived from the corporate media’s reactionary misrepresentations of intellectual men and women as lacking the common-sense of regular folk.|$|E

500|$|The tale has an {{underlying}} {{metaphor for the}} battle of brains vs. brawn. Physical strength, depicted as the orangutan {{as well as its}} owner, stand for violence: the orangutan is a murderer, while its owner admits he has abused the animal with a whip. The analyst's <b>brainpower</b> overcomes their violence. The story also contains Poe's often-used theme of the death of a beautiful woman, which he called the [...] "most poetical topic in the world".|$|E

500|$|No [...] "John Doe #2" [...] {{was ever}} identified, nothing {{conclusive}} was ever reported regarding {{the owner of}} the unmatched leg, and the government never openly investigated anyone else in conjunction with the bombing. Although the defense teams in both McVeigh's and Nichols trials suggested that others were involved, Judge Steven W. Taylor found no credible, relevant, or legally admissible evidence, of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing. When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing, he replied: [...] "You can't handle the truth! Because the truth is, I blew up the Murrah Building, and isn't it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell?" [...] On the morning of McVeigh's execution a letter was released in which he had written [...] "For those die-hard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this, I turn the tables and say: Show me where I needed anyone else.

500|$|In {{his review}} for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw wrote, [...] "I felt {{occasionally}} that Owen's rumpled performance {{is in danger}} of becoming a little one-note ... but this is still an unexpectedly well–made thriller with <b>brainpower</b> as well as firepower". Philip French, in his review for The Observer, called the film a [...] "slick, fast-moving conspiracy thriller" [...] and the gunfight in the Guggenheim [...] "spectacular". In his review for The Independent, Anthony Quinn wrote, [...] "It's reasonably efficient, passably entertaining, and strenuously playing catch-up with the Bourne movies: flat-footed Owen doesn't look as good as Matt Damon sprinting through city streets, and the editing doesn't match Paul Greengrass's whiplash pace". The New Yorker magazine's David Denby wrote, [...] "And there's a big hole {{in the middle of the}} movie: the director, Tom Tykwer, and the screenwriter, Eric Warren Singer, forgot to make their two crusaders human beings". In his review for The New York Post, Lou Lumenick wrote, [...] "There, an anticlimactic rooftop chase reminds us that Tykwer, the German director who reinvented the Euro thriller with Run, Lola, Run a decade ago, has been far surpassed by Paul Greengrass and the Bourne adventures, yet thankfully lacking the rampant and nonsensical roller-coaster style of editing, where no shot lingers for longer than a nano-second.". A.O. Scott, in his review for The New York Times, wrote, [...] "The International, in contrast, is so undistinguished that the moments you remember best are those that you wish another, more original director had tackled". Citing the climatic shoot-out in the Guggenheim, hailed by other critics as spectacular, Scott wonders if another, such as Brian de Palma could have [...] "turned into a fugue of architectural paranoia"? ...|$|E

2500|$|Through {{the aid of}} <b>brainpower</b> {{acquired}} through Operation Paperclip {{at the tail end}} of the European theater of World War II, the United States was able to embark on an ambitious program in rocketry. One of the first products of this was the development of rockets capable of holding nuclear warheads. The MGR-1 Honest John was the first such weapon, developed in 1953 as a surface-to-surface missile with a [...] maximum range. Because of their limited range, their potential use was heavily constrained (they could not, for example, threaten Moscow with an immediate strike).|$|E

He also defines his predicted date of the singularity (2045) in terms of when he expects computer-based intelligences to significantly exceed the sum total of human <b>brainpower,</b> writing that advances in computing before that date [...] "will not represent the Singularity" [...] because they do [...] "not yet correspond to a profound expansion of our intelligence." ...|$|E

In three years, the West was developing {{a bit of a}} fascination to India's <b>brainpower,</b> powered by IT and BPO. [...] By 2004, the West would consider investment in India, should the conditions permit. By the end of Vajpayee's term as prime minister, a framework for the foreign investment had been established.

2500|$|The most {{important}} of all the secret weapons programs in New Mexico was the Manhattan Project, which was the codename for the nuclear weapons experiments taking place across the United States, Canada, and Britain. It began in 1942 after Physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer assembled [...] "the greatest concentration of scientific resources and <b>brainpower</b> in history" [...] to build the world's first atomic bomb. To do this, the government had the army construct the giant Los Alamos National Laboratory twenty miles northwest of Santa Fe in 1943 and then sealed off the entire area to keep it secret. By the war's end in 1945, some 5,000 people lived at Los Alamos, which led to the founding of the present-day town.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{in spite}} of Dumbledore's many {{extraordinary}} qualities, he was no saint. According to Rowling, [...] "Although Dumbledore seems to be so benign for six books, he's quite a Machiavellian figure, really. He's been pulling a lot of strings." [...] In a 2005 interview, Rowling commented: [...] "Immense <b>brainpower</b> does not protect you from emotional mistakes, and I think Dumbledore really exemplifies that." [...] Dumbledore's greatest personality flaw, which he explained to Harry, was his desire for power. He eventually found that those best suited for power are {{those who do not}} seek it. When he and Grindelwald met each other, they made plans to enslave Muggles and re-establish wizards as the natural rulers of the world. However, Dumbledore was disillusioned of this fantasy after his sister Ariana was killed during a duel between himself, his brother Aberforth, and Grindelwald.|$|E
2500|$|According to Cristina Odone in The Observer, Dacre has a {{reputation}} towards underlings of [...] "verbal abuse [...] a drill sergeant's delight in public humiliation" [...] which also includes verbal abuse. Nick Davies, in his book Flat Earth News (2008), writes that Dacre's staff call his morning editorial meetings the [...] "Vagina Monologues" [...] because of his habit of calling everybody a [...] "cunt". In his Desert Island Discs appearance in 2004, host Sue Lawley quizzed him on his methods, to which Dacre responded: [...] "Shouting creates energy, energy creates great headlines." [...] Conrad Black, a convicted fraudster and ex-proprietor of the Telegraph papers, considers him [...] "a saturnine and capricious manipulator". Peter Wilby, in a December 2013 profile for the New Statesman, quoted an anonymous source, who said of Dacre: [...] "He’s no longer the expletive volcano he once was; his barbs these days tend to concern the <b>brainpower</b> of his target and their supposed laziness." ...|$|E
2500|$|A common {{misunderstanding}} {{about the}} intelligence of breeds in the Hound group stems from their independent nature, which conflicts with the frequent confusion between the concepts of [...] "intelligence" [...] and [...] "obedience" [...] in discussions of canine <b>brainpower.</b> Stanley Coren's survey of canine obedience trainers published in The Intelligence of Dogs reported that borzois obeyed the first command less than 25% of the time. Coren's test, however, was {{by his own admission}} heavily weighted towards the [...] "obedience" [...] interpretation of intelligence and based on a better understanding of [...] "working" [...] breeds than hounds. Unfortunately, the publicity given to this report has led to unfair denigration of breeds which are under-represented in obedience clubs and poorly understood by the average obedience trainer. [...] "Work" [...] for hound breeds is done out of hearing and often {{out of sight of the}} human companion; it is an activity for which the dogs are [...] "released", rather than an activity which is [...] "commanded".|$|E
