40|$|AbstractAntibacterial silver {{coatings}} on textiles, {{formed by}} various coating processes, have attracted substantial attention. However, {{the durability of}} these coatings in practice is poor, limiting their usage. The goal {{of this study is}} to prepare antibacterial silver films on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabrics by high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS), which is known to provide a high plasma density, so as to form a strongly adhered film at a relatively low substrate temperature. These silver-coated textiles are expected to exhibit antibacterial efficacy and durability. The experimental results herein reveal that the silver coating can be successfully deposited on PET fabric by HIPIMS with a crystal structure presenting (111) preferred orientation and that the fibers are uniformly covered. Pre-treatment with oxygen plasma for a single minute can effectively enhance film adhesion in dry and wet rubbing tests, such that the color fastness can be ranked Grade 5 and Grade 4, respectively. The coated fabric retains the mechanical properties of its original <b>bare</b> <b>fabric</b> and the coating procedure does not induce damage to PET fabric. Antimicrobial performance testing indicates that a silver film that is deposited for more than 1 min provides strong bacteriostatic (> 2. 0) and bactericidal (> 0) effects, based on the JIS Standard. Additionally, the coated fabrics retain their antimicrobial capability after 20 cycles of washing, demonstrating their long-term durability...|$|E

In it, Soyinka unveils the rotten aspects of the society and demonstrates that the past is {{no better than the}} present {{when it comes to the}} seamy side of life. He lays <b>bare</b> the <b>fabric</b> of the Nigerian society and warns people as they are on the brink of a new stage in their history; independence.|$|R

In 1942, the United States War Production Board issued Regulation L-85, cutting the use of natural fibers in clothing and mandating a 10% reduction {{in the amount of}} fabric in women's beachwear. To comply with the regulations, swimsuit manufacturers produced two-piece suits with <b>bare</b> midriffs. The <b>fabric</b> shortage continued for some time {{after the end of the}} war.|$|R
40|$|We present new multibeam {{bathymetric}} and multichannel seismic {{data on the}} Middle American Trench, between 17 and 19 °N. These data show, {{north of}} the present tip of the East Pacific Rise, unsedimented seafloor with an abyssal hill <b>fabric</b> <b>bare</b> of sediments at the outer wall of the trench (18 ° 30 'N). Two multichannel seismic profiles orthogonal to the Middle American Trench display clear oceanic crust extending more than 20 km beneath the overriding plate. These seismic images suggest that the subducting oceanic crust along the Middle American Trench is younger than previously proposed. This result, therefore, implies a new location for the East Pacific Rise termination {{in relation to the}} trench. The subduction of this young oceanic crust off western Mexico provides new constraints on the deformation and magnetism of the western Mexican mainland. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{composite}} materials invented {{to be used}} in structures with the purpose of high load-bearing with excellent in-plane properties. Continuous fiber reinforced composites are one of the mostly used categories of advanced composites. This class of composites has gained a lot of attention due to their light-weight and decent mechanical properties. However, additional material design is required to tune both mechanical and structural properties of these composites. Since the load transfer between reinforcement phase and polymer matrix happens at the interfacial region, a better interphase might result in a composite with higher vibration damping. In this study, a gradient interphase between carbon fiber and polymer matrix has been created by using ZnO nanowires to engineer the damping loss factor of the carbon fiber composites. For the growth of ZnO nanowires on the carbon fabric, low temperature hydrothermal reaction has been used. Then the carbon fabrics with ZnO nanowires were infiltrated with a low viscosity epoxy using vacuum assisted resin transfer molding technique. The stiffness and structural damping of the composite were examined using dynamic mechanical analysis. The results show that the damping properties of hybrid composites using ZnO nanowires are enhanced compare to the <b>bare</b> carbon <b>fabric</b> composites. Since the growth of ZnO nanowires is a tunable process, the length, diameter and aspect ratio of the nanowires and consequently the architecture of the interphase can be tailored for the desired vibration damping in the system. Thus, the hybrid composites with ZnO nanowire interphase can be used to enhance the energy dissipation in a structural system...|$|R
