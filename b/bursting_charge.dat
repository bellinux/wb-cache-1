25|$|RDX was {{reported}} in 1898 by Georg Friedrich Henning, who obtained a German patent (patent No. 104280) for its manufacture by nitrolysis of hexamine (hexamethylenetetramine) with concentrated nitric acid. In this patent, the medical properties of RDX were mentioned; however, three further German patents obtained by Henning in 1916 proposed its use in smokeless propellants. The German military started investigating its use in 1920, referring to it as hexogen. Research and development findings were not published further until Edmund von Herz, described as an Austrian and later a German citizen, obtained a British patent in 1921 and a United States patent in 1922. Both patent claims were initiated in Austria; and described the manufacture of RDX by nitrating hexamethylenetetramine. The British patent claims included the manufacture of RDX by nitration, its use with or without other explosives, and its use as a <b>bursting</b> <b>charge</b> and as an initiator. The US patent claim was {{for the use of}} a hollow explosive device containing RDX and a detonator cap containing RDX. In the 1930s, Germany developed improved production methods.|$|E

One of the earliest references to the destructive force of a cannon in China was made by Zhang Xian in 1341, with his verse known as The Iron Cannon Affair. Zhang wrote that its cannonball could [...] "pierce the heart or belly when it strikes a man or horse, and can even transfix several persons at once".

The ammunition consisted of hollow cast iron shells packed with gunpowder to create an explosive effect. Also mentioned is a [...] "poison-fog divine smoke eruptor," [...] in which [...] "blinding gunpowder" [...] and [...] "poisonous gunpowder" [...] were packed into hollow shells used in burning the faces and eyes of enemies, along with choking them with a formidable spray of poisonous smoke. Cannons were mounted on frames or on wheeled carriages {{so that they could}} be rotated to change directions.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the primary}} {{armament}} of the Yamato class was officially {{designated as the}} 40cm/45 caliber (15.9in) Type 94, it actually {{took the form of}} nine 46 cm/45 caliber (18.1 in) guns—the largest guns ever fitted to a warship—mounted in three 3-gun turrets, each of which weighed 2,774 metric tons. Each gun was [...] long and weighed [...] High-explosive armour-piercing shells were used which were capable of being fired [...] at a rate of 1½ to 2 per minute. The main guns were also capable of firing [...] 3 Shiki tsûjôdan ("Common Type 3") anti-aircraft shells. [...] A time fuze was used to set how far away the shells would explode (although they were commonly set to go off [...] away). Upon detonation, each of these shells would release 900 incendiary-filled tubes in a 20° cone facing towards incoming aircraft; a <b>bursting</b> <b>charge</b> was then used to explode the shell itself so that more steel splinters were created, and then the tubes would ignite. The tubes would burn for five seconds at about [...] and would start a flame that was around [...] long. Even though they comprised 40% of the total main ammunition load by 1944, 3 Shiki tsûjôdan were rarely used in combat against enemy aircraft due to the severe damage the firing of these shells inflicted on the barrels of the main guns; indeed, one of the shells may have exploded early and disabled one of Musashis guns during the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea. [...] The shells were intended to put up a barrage of flame that any aircraft attempting to attack would have to navigate through. However, U.S. pilots considered these shells {{to be more of a}} pyrotechnics display than a competent anti-aircraft weapon.|$|E

Rifles varied between modern German, Turkish and British types, to obsolete Martinis and Snyders. Few infantry units had bayonets. Artillery was ponydrawn, or pack, and included modern 10cm Krupp howitzers, 75mm Krupp mountain guns and ancient 7 pounder weapons. There were a few, very old, four-barrel Gardiner machine guns. Ammunition was in short supply and distribution {{must have been very}} difficult. For the artillery much black powder was used, both as a propellent and <b>bursting</b> <b>charge</b> for shells. The Kabul arsenal workshops were elementary and mainly staffed by Sikh artificers with much ingenuity but little real skill. There was no organised transport and arrangements for supply were rudimentary".|$|E
2500|$|A {{new version}} of the 30.5-cm Beta-Gerät howitzer, vastly {{superior}} to the 1897 model, was developed in 1908, but finding it wanting in offensive power, the Artillerieprüfungskommission ("artillery testing committee," [...] APK) asked Krupp to build a larger gun capable of smashing modern fortifications. Krupp first investigated the possibility of building a 35-cm weapon, but instead jumped to 42-cm as this was the smallest shell that could carry the large <b>bursting</b> <b>charge</b> required to fulfill the APK's requirements. The first 42-cm design was the massive L/16 (the barrel was 16 calibres in length) Gamma-Gerät howitzer, which was a scaled-up version of the Beta-Gerät. Unusually for Krupp, both the Beta and Gamma weapons eschewed the usual sliding-wedge breech mechanism in favour of a screw-type breech, after the practice common in Britain and France.|$|E

5000|$|Case (or [...] "spherical case" [...] for smoothbores) were antipersonnel {{projectiles}} {{carrying a}} smaller <b>burst</b> <b>charge</b> than shell, but {{designed to be}} more effective against exposed troops. While shell produced only a few large fragments, case was loaded with lead or iron balls and was designed to burst above and before the enemy line, showering down many more small but destructive projectiles on the enemy. The effect was analogous to a weaker version of canister. With case the lethality of the balls and fragments came from the velocity of the bursting projectile itself—the small <b>burst</b> <b>charge</b> only fragmented the case and dispersed the shrapnel. The spherical case used in a 12-pounder Napoleon contained 78 balls. The name shrapnel derives from its inventor, Henry Shrapnel.|$|R
2500|$|The King George V and {{the four}} other ships of the class as built carried ten BL 14 inch Mk VII naval guns, in two quadruple turrets fore and aft and a single twin turret behind and above the fore turret. There was debate within the Admiralty over the choice of gun calibre; though there was little or no debate within Parliament; other European powers {{preferred}} 15-inch, and the USN, 16-inch main guns. Initially the Admiralty studied vessels armed {{with a variety of}} differing main armament layouts including nine [...] guns in three turrets, two forward and one aft. While this was well within the capabilities of the British shipyards, the design was quickly rejected as they felt compelled to adhere to the Second London Naval Treaty signed in 1936, and there was a serious shortage of skilled technicians and ordnance designers, along with compelling pressures to reduce weight. As a result, the class was designed to carry twelve 14-inch guns in three quadruple turrets and this configuration had a heavier broadside than the nine 15-inch guns. Unfortunately, it proved impossible to include this amount of firepower and the desired level of protection on a 35,000ton displacement, and the weight of the superimposed quadruple turret brought the stability of the vessel into question. In the end, the second forward turret was changed to a smaller two gun turret in exchange for better armour protection, reducing the broadside weight to below that of the nine gun arrangement. The 14-inch Armour Piercing (AP) shell also carried a very large <b>bursting</b> <b>charge</b> of [...] The armour-piercing capability of the gun and its ammunition is exhibited by the conning tower on the wreck of the German battleship Bismarck, provided with 14-inch thick armour, which is said to resemble a [...] "Swiss cheese". The last naval treaty had an escalator clause that permitted a change to 16-inch guns if another signatory did not conform to it by 1 January 1937. Although they could have invoked this clause, the effect would have been to delay construction and it was considered prudent to build with 14-inch rather than find themselves without the new battleships. The U.S. opted to absorb a delay and built its ships with larger guns. When comparing the British 14-inch gun to the heavier guns mounted on contemporary foreign battleships {{it should be noted that}} the thicker armour of the British battleships tended to result in an equalisation of the relative penetrating power of respective shells.|$|E
60|$|Information now came in that, to the north, {{the most}} {{reckless}} of the Ashantis had again concentrated, and {{were determined to}} make another stand. On the 16th {{there was a big}} review of the seventeen hundred troops and the nine guns of the garrison. The heavy guns were exercised on a stockade, {{similar to those of the}} enemy. Hitherto they had not been altogether successful; as it was found that, owing to the large <b>bursting</b> <b>charge,</b> the range had to be estimated at double its real distance.

Since before World War II, 127 mm (5 inches) has been the standard gun caliber for U.S. Naval ships. Its rate of fire is lower than the British 4.5 in gun, but it fires a heavier 127 mm (5-inch) shell which carries a larger <b>burst</b> <b>charge</b> that increases its per-shell effectiveness against aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese fleets had practised gunnery {{regularly}} {{since the}} beginning of the war, using sub-calibre adapters in their guns and gaining more experience than the Russians.

The Russians used armour-piercing rounds with small guncotton <b>bursting</b> <b>charges</b> and unreliable fuses. Japanese hits caused more damage to Russian ships relative to Russian hits on Japanese ships, setting the superstructures, the paintwork and the large quantities of coal stored on the decks on fire.
