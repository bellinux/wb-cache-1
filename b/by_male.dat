5|$|In a {{study of}} risk taking, some types of risk, such as {{physical}} or heroic risk for others' benefit, are viewed more favorably than other types of risk, such as taking drugs. Males and females valued different degrees of heroic risk for mates and same-sex friends. Males valued heroic risk taking <b>by</b> <b>male</b> friends, but preferred less of it in female mates. Females valued heroic risk taking in male mates and less of it in female friends. Females may be attracted to males inclined to physically defend them and their children. Males may prefer heroic risk taking <b>by</b> <b>male</b> friends {{as they could be}} good allies.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts was {{originally}} inhabited by tribes of the Algonquian language family {{such as the}} Wampanoag, Narragansett, Nipmuc, Pocomtuc, Mahican, and Massachusett. While cultivation of crops like squash and corn supplemented their diets, these tribes were generally dependent on hunting, gathering and fishing {{for most of their}} food. Villages consisted of lodges called wigwams as well as longhouses, and tribes were led <b>by</b> <b>male</b> or female elders known as sachems.|$|E
5|$|Fairywrens exhibit one of {{the highest}} incidences of extra-pair mating, and many broods are brought up a <b>by</b> <b>male</b> who is not the natural father. However, {{courtship}} methods among white-winged fairywrens remain unclear. Blue-plumaged males have been seen outside of their territory and in some cases, carrying pink or purple petals, which among other species advertise the male to neighboring females. In contrast, black-plumaged males on Barrow and Dirk Hartog islands often carry blue petals. While petal-carrying outside of clan territories strongly suggests mating with other females is occurring, further genetic analysis is necessary.|$|E

40|$|In {{the parental}} care of burying beetles of Nicrophorus, {{the role of}} males has not been clearly elucidated. To test our {{hypothesis}} that the investment in resource manipulation <b>by</b> <b>males</b> influences the feeding of larvae <b>by</b> <b>males,</b> we investigated parental efforts of N. quadripunctatus. On the small carcasses, the time spent on resource manipulation <b>by</b> <b>males</b> was short, and the males left the carcasses without feeding the larvae (maternal feeding). On the large carcasses, the males {{spent a long time}} on resource manipulation, and the male participated in the feeding of larvae (biparental feeding). This suggests that one of the reproductive roles of males in the absence of predators and/or competitors is resource manipulation, and the paternal efforts change depending on carcass size. A longer time spent on resource manipulation <b>by</b> <b>males</b> may be a trigger for the males to participate in the feeding of larvae on large carcasses...|$|R
5|$|This species' call is a distinctive, plaintive cooOOoo-woo-woo-woooo, uttered <b>by</b> <b>males</b> {{to attract}} females, {{and may be}} mistaken for the call of an owl at first. (Close up, a grating or throat-rattling sound may be heard {{preceding}} the first coo.) Other sounds include a nest call (cooOOoo) <b>by</b> paired <b>males</b> to attract their mates to the nest sites, a greeting call (a soft ork) <b>by</b> <b>males</b> upon rejoining their mates, and an alarm call (a short roo-oo) <b>by</b> either <b>male</b> or female when threatened. In flight, the wings make a fluttery whistling sound {{that is hard to}} hear. The wing whistle is much louder and more noticeable upon take-off and landing.|$|R
5|$|The {{duration}} of parental care in frigatebirds {{is among the}} longest for birds, rivalled only by the southern ground hornbill and some large accipitrids. Frigatebirds take many years to reach sexual maturity. A study of great frigatebirds in the Galapagos Islands found that they only bred once they have acquired the full adult plumage.

5|$|The first skyscrapers {{were mainly}} {{occupied}} <b>by</b> <b>male</b> workers, but this changed during the 1890s, with female employees becoming more common. The percentage of female clerical workers in Chicago, for example, increased from 11 percent in 1880 to 21 percent by 1890, reaching 30 percent by 1900. Various moral concerns were raised about {{men and women}} mixing in such offices, which were characterized as being masculine spaces, full of tobacco smoke and profanity and therefore unsuitable for women. The new female workers typically worked as typists or stenographers, using the recently invented typewriter, which grew in number in U.S. offices from 146 in 1879 to 65,000 by 1890.|$|E
5|$|The men's hammer throw {{became an}} Olympic event in 1900 but the women's event – using a 4kg (8.82lb) weight – was not widely competed until much later, finally {{featuring}} on the women's Olympic programme in 2000. The distances thrown <b>by</b> <b>male</b> athletes became greater from the 1950s onwards {{as a result}} of improved equipment using the denser metals, a switch to concrete throwing areas, and more advanced training techniques. Professional hammer throwers as historically large, strong, sturdy athletes. However, qualities such as refined technique, speed and flexibility have become increasingly important in the modern era as the legal throwing area has been reduced from 90 to 34.92 degrees and throwing technique involves three to four controlled rotations.|$|E

5|$|The third suborder, Sirenoidea, {{contains}} the four species of sirens, {{which are in}} a single family, Sirenidae. Members of this order are eel-like aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs. Some of their features are primitive while others are derived. Fertilisation {{is likely to be}} external as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used <b>by</b> <b>male</b> salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermathecae for sperm storage. Despite this, the eggs are laid singly, a behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation.|$|E
5|$|According to Twelvers, {{there is}} at all times an Imam of the era who is the divinely {{appointed}} authority on all matters of faith and law in the Muslim community. Ali {{was the first of}} the Twelve Imams, and, in the Twelvers and Sufis' view, the rightful successor to Muhammad, followed <b>by</b> <b>male</b> descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of Husayn ibn Ali, who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali. The twelfth and final Imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive, and hidden in the Major Occultation until he returns to bring justice to the world. It is believed by Twelver Shia and Alevi Muslims that the Twelve Imams have been foretold in the Hadith of the Twelve Successors. All of the Imams met unnatural deaths, with the exception of the last Imam, who according to Twelver and Alevi belief, is living in occultation.|$|E

5|$|Deshastha Brahmins dispose {{their dead}} by {{cremation}}. The dead person's son carries the corpse to the cremation ground atop a bier. The eldest son lights {{the fire to}} the corpse at the head for males and at the feet for females. The ashes are gathered in an earthen pitcher and immersed in a river {{on the third day}} after the death. This is a 13-day ritual with the pinda being offered to the dead soul on the 11th and a Śrāddha ceremony followed by a funeral feast on the 13th. Cremation is performed according to vedic rites, usually within a day of the individual's death. Like all other Hindus, the preference is for the ashes to be immersed in the Ganges river or Godavari river. Śrāddha becomes an annual ritual in which all forefathers of the family who have passed on are remembered. These rituals are expected to be performed only <b>by</b> <b>male</b> descendants, preferably the eldest son of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{designs were}} done by Senri Kita, an artist {{new to the}} series. In contrast to previous Fire Emblem games, where the protagonist was of royal blood, the main character Ike {{was intended to be}} of lower social rank, a mercenary who becomes involved in royal politics and conflict rather than being born into it. Ike was born from the many ideas for new directions being suggested for the new 3D game, with many people wanting the protagonist everyone could empathize with. His status as a mercenary was a highly requested character trait <b>by</b> <b>male</b> staff. A character that returned from previous games was Jeigan, who was this time designed as a female character. Designing all the characters to be unique under the new conditions proved a challenge. This also resulted in higher-quality character artwork being produced during the initial design stages. The full-motion videos were created by Japanese animation studio Digital Frontier. Introducing the cutscenes into the game proved challenging for the team. The game's subtitle does not refer to a specific object or place, but instead acts {{as a metaphor for the}} journeys of Ike and other characters.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of antbirds is {{soft and}} not brightly coloured, {{although}} it is occasionally striking. The colour palette of most species is blackish shades, whitish shades, rufous, chestnut and brown. Plumages can be uniform in colour or patterned with barring or spots. Sexual dimorphism – differences in plumage colour and pattern {{between males and females}} – is common in the family. Overall the pattern within the family is for the males to have combinations of grey, black or white plumage and the females having buff, rufous and brown colours. For example, the male dot-winged antwren is primarily blackish, whereas the female has rust-coloured underparts. In some genera, such as Myrmotherula, species are better distinguished by female plumage than <b>by</b> <b>male.</b> Many species of antbirds have a contrasting 'patch' of white (sometimes other colours) feathers on the back (known as interscapular patches), shoulder or underwing. This is usually concealed by the darker feathers on the back but when the bird is excited or alarmed these feathers can be raised to flash the white patch. dot-winged antwrens puff out white back patches, whereas in bluish-slate antshrikes and white-flanked antwrens the white patch is on the shoulder.|$|E

5|$|The red-capped robin is {{territorial}} {{during the}} breeding season; the area occupied has been measured between 0.25 and 1.2ha (0.6–3acres). A pair lives and forages within their territory before dispersing in autumn. The male proclaims ownership by singing loudly from a suitable perch at the territory boundary, and confronts other males with a harsh scolding call should they make an incursion. Two males {{have been seen}} to face one another 30cm to 1m (12–40in) apart, flicking wings and manoeuvring for position in a threat display while the female is incubating her eggs. Both sexes also react to the playback of song recordings. The male will also defend against incursions <b>by</b> <b>male</b> scarlet robins, and conversely avoid foraging in the latter species' territories. Most juvenile red-capped robins are unable to live in territories occupied by adult birds, and need to travel to find unoccupied land; the furthest dispersal recorded to date has been 36km (22mi), from Terrick Terrick National Park across farmland to Gunbower State Forest in northern Victoria.|$|E
5|$|While 18thcentury metal mines {{had worked}} on the {{principle}} of adult men digging the ore and women and children picking and cobbing the ore ready for smelting, in the new large-scale mines of the early 19thcentury working practices changed. The strenuous underground work was still carried out <b>by</b> <b>male</b> workers, as was breaking large rocks with heavy hammers ('ragging'). In copper mines, very young girls, and sick and injured older women, carried out the simple work of picking. Girls in their late teens forced the broken ore through a broad mesh to sort the ore ('riddling'), and used hammers to break the large chunks of ore left by the riddling process into smaller chunks. Girls in their mid-teens cobbed the resulting chunks, separating the valuable ore from waste rock. Grown women would carry out the heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers ('spalling'), of crushing sorted ore to small grains ready for smelting ('bucking') and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus. An experienced bal maiden working as a spaller would produce approximately one ton (2240lb; 1016kg) of broken ore per day, {{depending on the type of}} stone. In the tin mines, in which ore could be crushed far more finely than copper before smelting, cobbing and bucking did not take place. Instead, the chunks of spalled ore were mechanically stamped to fine grains, and washed into a series of collecting pits to separate the coarse 'rough' from the fine 'slimes'. The resulting rough and slimes were separated out on large wooden frames ('buddling' and 'framing' respectively), to extract the tin ore from the surrounding dust and grit.|$|E

50|$|The Pieris napi {{butterfly}} {{uses the}} release of citral as a male sex pheromone signal produced <b>by</b> <b>males</b> directed to females during courtship. Most of the chemical cues produced <b>by</b> <b>males</b> are associated to a female response involving courtship, mate-choice, species-specific identification and sex-specific signals. The scents are also said to influence male-male competition and forcing males to guard their mating territories. The citral pheromone is also released during male-male competition as pheromones are released during most male flight activity however; there is a less of a response to males as when compared to females. Females have higher antennae sensitivity to the citral pheromones rather than males, triggering a reduced reaction <b>by</b> <b>males.</b>|$|R
