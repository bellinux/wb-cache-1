5|$|The {{common law}} is, however, capable of {{evolving}} {{in the light}} of changing social, economic and cultural developments. Hale's proposition reflected the state of affairs in these respects {{at the time it was}} enunciated. Since then the status of women, and particularly of married women, has changed out of all recognition in various ways which are very familiar and upon which it is unnecessary to go into detail. Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most important changes is that marriage is in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife must be the subservient chattel of the husband. Hale's proposition involves that by marriage a wife gives her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happens to <b>be</b> <b>feeling</b> at the time. In modern times any reasonable person must regard that conception as quite unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} to humanistic counseling and therapy is Gestalt therapy, which puts {{a focus on}} the here and now, especially as an opportunity to look past any preconceived notions and focus on how the present is affected by the past. Role playing also plays a large role in Gestalt therapy and allows for a true expression of feelings that may not have been shared in other circumstances. In Gestalt therapy, non-verbal cues are an important indicator of how the client may actually <b>be</b> <b>feeling,</b> despite the feelings expressed.|$|E
25|$|The theory {{holds that}} the stages {{are a part of}} the {{framework}} that helps people learn to live without what they lost. Lay people and practitioners consider the stages as tools to help frame and identify what a person who's suffered a loss may <b>be</b> <b>feeling.</b> The theory {{holds that the}} stages are not stops on a linear time line of grief. The theory also states that not everyone goes through all of the stages, nor in a prescribed order. In addition to the five-stages theory, Kübler-Ross has been credited with bringing mainstream awareness to the sensitivity required for better treatment of people who are dealing with a fatal disease.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{ingredients}} are fictional, mixing them together creates nonfictional cocktails as well, {{such as the}} Piledriver or Blue Fairy. To add additional variety, patrons at the bar may ask for single, multiple, or one large drink; these drinks can be served either aged or with ice. Players must also pay attention to infer what patrons actually want, which may be {{different from what they}} order. For example, a character might <b>be</b> <b>feeling</b> depressed and ask for a sweet drink, though the player instead giving them a shot of alcohol to help them forget their troubles would have a better effect. Alternately, the player may {{be able to make a}} character happy by talking to them instead of letting them feed on their alcoholism. At various points, the player can also tweak the customer's drink, such as adding Karmotrine to a cocktail that was previously non-alcoholic. In these ways, the player creates new scenarios as they advance in the game.|$|E
25|$|Their ratting {{talent and}} unique bond was seized {{upon by the}} city's press. Martin's saloon was a {{favorite}} haunt of newspapermen and journalists, so, with the dogs a fixture outside the bar, they never had to travel far for a story. The exploits of the dogs were recorded in detail in the Californian, Daily Alta California, Daily Morning Call, and Daily Evening Bulletin, the editors vying {{with each other in}} their attempts to endow the pair's adventures with thrills and parallels to the human condition. Bummer was portrayed as the gentleman down on his luck, yet still faithful and conscientious, while Lazarus, the mongrel, was cast {{in the role of the}} sly and self-serving fair-weather friend. When Bummer was shot in the leg after only a couple of months, and Lazarus left him to run with another dog, it suited the press no end: Bummer was said to <b>be</b> <b>feeling</b> the sting of ingratitude at the desertion of the cur he had saved from death. Lazarus' return when Bummer recovered only added to the excitement.|$|E

500|$|In October 1899, Ricordi {{realized}} {{that some of}} the music for Cavaradossi's act 3 aria, [...] "O dolci mani" [...] was borrowed from music Puccini had cut from his early opera, Edgar and demanded changes. Puccini defended his music as expressive of what Cavaradossi must <b>be</b> <b>feeling</b> at that point, and offered to come to Milan to play and sing act 3 for the publisher. Ricordi was overwhelmed by the completed act 3 prelude, which he received in early November, and softened his views, though he was still not completely happy with the music for [...] "O dolci mani". In any event time was too short before the scheduled January 1900 premiere to make any further changes.|$|E

[...] They tried to replicate this unsettling, unpredictable sound on the album, but [...] "wanted a happy ending". In an interview with The Independent, Higgs spoke of Radiohead's critically acclaimed Kid A (2000) as a further influence, as they [...] "threw out guitars, and with it the very idea of genre". Radiohead's influence on the record was commented on further by Laura Snapes at Pitchfork, who noted the use of a [...] "paranoid guitar solo borrowed from Hail to the Thief". Critics would later refer to their sound generally as [...] "maximalist art pop" [...] or art rock. In other sections of the album, they experimented with other genres; Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of the Financial Times noted the [...] "Talking Heads-style Afro-pop" [...] of title track [...] "Get to Heaven".|$|E

The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. [...] "It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them," [...] Cameron stated. [...] "They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot." [...] Cameron said he and his crew [...] "were just trying to find things to shoot" [...] because the big set [...] "wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot." [...] After seeing the scene on film, Cameron felt it worked out considerably well.|$|E

Online reported that a casting call for the video was made, where the agents looked for a Puerto Rican or Dominican origin male. Other roles included a male or female on-air reporter, a doctor role reminiscent to the one in the American show Dr. 90210, and a group of military men for scenes involving rifles. The music video director was confirmed as Joseph Kahn, but Interscope Records later confirmed that Kahn and Gaga parted ways due to collaborative misunderstandings. Gibson confirmed that there was [...] "some issues on the set", which resulted in Kahn being replaced as the director.|$|E

500|$|Besides Morrison, {{there is}} {{conflicting}} information about {{who participated in}} the session. In addition to the group's original members (guitarist Billy Harrison, bassist Alan Henderson, drummer Ronnie Millings, and keyboard player Eric Wrixon), others have been suggested: Pat McAuley on keyboards, Bobby Graham on a second drum kit, Jimmy Page on second guitar, and Peter Bardens on keyboards. As Page biographer George Case notes, [...] "There is a dispute over whether it is Page's piercing blues line that defines the song, if he only played a run Harrison had already devised, or if Page only backed up Harrison himself". Morrison has acknowledged Page's participation in the early sessions: [...] "He played rhythm guitar on one thing and doubled a bass riff on the other" [...] and Morrison biographer Johnny Rogan notes that Page [...] "doubled the distinctive riff already worked out by Billy Harrison". Music critic Greil Marcus comments that during the song's quieter middle passage [...] "the guitarist, session player Jimmy Page or not, seems to <b>be</b> <b>feeling</b> his way into another song, flipping half-riffs, high, random, distracted metal shavings". Them's blues-rock arrangement is [...] "now regarded justly as definitive", with [...] "much of its appeal emanat from the tingling lead guitar section", according to music writer Adam Clayson.|$|E

[...] Jason Lipshutz of the same publication described it as a [...] "smile-inducing clip with a dream wedding". A writer of Rap-Up praised the video's [...] "fairytale" [...] ending. Gordon Smart of The Sun described the white corset that Beyoncé wore in the video as sexy and wrote that [...] "her ex will <b>be</b> <b>feeling</b> a bit of a mug watching it when he remembers what he's missing out on." [...] Ashleigh Rainbird of the Daily Mirror found Beyoncé, [...] "looking sexy in white lacy undies and garter – and later in a Big Fat Gypsy Wedding-style frock". Amos Barshad of New York magazine commented, [...] "To just full-on hammer down the whole 'mature and settled down and happy' thing, Mrs. Hova saunters around with the most irrepressible smile you've ever seen, shimmying amazingly (note the moves at 3:30) as home footage of that jerk she threw away like a parking ticket cuts in and out."

Entertainment Weekly's Michael Slezak called the song [...] "a future smash hit" [...] and described it as [...] "downright verbose – packing in some sweet, new-age-y sentiments about existing in the moment, living without regret, and saying 'I love you' early and often {{to the people in}} our lives".

500|$|In June 1837 Chopin visited London incognito in {{the company}} of the piano {{manufacturer}} Camille Pleyel where he played at a musical soirée at the house of English piano maker James Broadwood. On his return to Paris, his association with Sand began in earnest, {{and by the end of}} June 1838 they had become lovers. Sand, who was six years older than the composer, and who had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: [...] "I must say I was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me... I have still not recovered from my astonishment, and if I were a proud person I should <b>be</b> <b>feeling</b> humiliated at having been carried away..." [...] The two spent a miserable winter on Majorca (8 November 1838 to 13 February 1839), where, together with Sand's two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of Chopin and that of Sand's 15-year-old son Maurice, and also to escape the threats of Sand's former lover Félicien Mallefille. After discovering that the couple were not married, the deeply traditional Catholic people of Majorca became inhospitable, making accommodation difficult to find. This compelled the group to take lodgings in a former Carthusian monastery in Valldemossa, which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather.|$|E
500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go to the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must <b>be</b> <b>feeling</b> right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E
