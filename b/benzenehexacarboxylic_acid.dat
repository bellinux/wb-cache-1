5000|$|Hexamethylbenzene is {{sometimes}} called mellitene, a name derived from mellite, a rare honey-coloured mineral; [...] meli (GEN [...] melitos) is the Greek word for honey. Mellite is composed of a hydrated aluminium salt of <b>benzenehexacarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> (mellitic acid), with formula [...] Mellitic acid itself {{can be derived from}} the mineral, and subsequent reduction yields mellitene. Conversely, mellitene can be oxidised to form mellitic acid: ...|$|E
40|$|By {{reaction}} {{between the}} anion of mellitic acid (<b>benzenehexacarboxylic</b> <b>acid)</b> and some protonated linear polyamines (diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylene-pentamine, pentaethylenehexamine, spermidine, and spermine), fairly insoluble complexes have been obtained, {{with the general}} formula (amine) (x) (mellitate) H- 6 (diethylenetriamine and spermidine, x = 1; triethylenetetramine and spermine, x = 0. 75; tetraethylenepentamine, x = 0. 6 and 0. 8; pentaethylenehexamine, x= 0. 5). K-s 0 values for these complexes have been determined at I= 0 mol dm(- 3) and T= 25 degrees C (log K-s 0 ranges between - 48. 2 and - 56. 6). The solubility has been studied {{as a function of}} pH and of ionic strength. The thermal analysis, performed using air or argon flow, showed that all the solids behave in a similar way. In the range 20 - 120 degrees C the loss of hydration water occurs, and in the range 150 - 350 degrees C the first step of non oxidative decomposition takes place, with complete decomposition at 650 degrees C in air flow, whilst in argon flow the decomposition is still incomplete at 900 degrees C. Preliminary results of a parallel diffractometric study are also reported. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|GC-MS on the Viking 1976 Mars {{missions}} did {{not detect}} organic molecules on the Martian surface, even those expected from meteorite bombardment. This result {{suggested that the}} Martian regolith might hold a potent oxidant that converts all organic molecules to carbon dioxide rapidly relative to {{the rate at which}} they arrive. This conclusion is influencing the design of Mars missions. We reexamine this conclusion in light of what is known about the oxidation of organic compounds generally and the nature of organics likely to come to Mars via meteorite. We conclude that nonvolatile salts of benzenecarboxylic acids, and perhaps oxalic and acetic acid, should be metastable intermediates of meteoritic organics under oxidizing conditions. Salts of these organic acids would have been largely invisible to GC-MS. Experiments show that one of these, <b>benzenehexacarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> (mellitic acid), is generated by oxidation of organic matter known to come to Mars, is rather stable to further oxidation, and would not have been easily detected by the Viking experiments. Approximately 2 kg of meteorite-derived mellitic acid may have been generated per m 2 of Martian surface over 3 billion years. How much remains depends on decomposition rates under Martian conditions. As available data do not require that the surface of Mars be very strongly oxidizing, some organic molecules might be found near the surface of Mars, perhaps in amounts sufficient to be a resource. Missions should seek these and recognize that these complicate the search for organics from entirely hypothetical Martian life...|$|E
40|$|The {{return and}} {{analysis}} of pristine material that is relict of a putative period of chemical evolution is a fumdamental goal of the exobiological exploration of Mars. In order to accomplish this objective, it is desirable to find oxidant-free regions where pristine material can be accessed at the shallowest possible depth (ideally directly from the surface). The objective of our ongoing research is to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of oxidants in the martian regolith and the redox chemistry of the soil; in effect to understand the chemical mechanisms and kinetics relating to the in-situ destruction of organics {{and the formation of}} the reactive species responsible for the Viking biology results. In this work, we report on experimental studies of oxidizing processes that may contribute to carbonate and organic degradation on Mars. Organic molecules directly exposed to solar UV may decomposed either directly into CO 2, or into more volatile organic fragments. Organic macromolecules not directly exposed to high UV flux {{are most likely to be}} affected by atmospheric oxidants which can diffuse to their surfaces. The oxidizing processes examined include: gas-phase oxidants, UV photolysis, and UV-assisted heterogeneous catalysis. For example, assuming a meteroritic infall rate of 4 x 10 (exp - 4) g/m^ 2 yr (Flynn and McKay 1990) and a flux of organic carbon of 2 x 10 (exp - 5) g/m^ 2 yr, laboratory measurements of the UV-assisted decomposition of <b>benzenehexacarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> (mellitic acid, a likely intermediate of kerogen oxidation), indicate its decomposition rate on Mars would exceed the total flux of organic carbon to the planet by over four orders of magnitude. Our measurements indicate that although the decomposition temperature of kerogens in some cases exceeds the temperature limit of the Viking GCMS, it is unlikely kerogens or their decomposition intermediates were present at the Viking landings sites at levels above the GCMS detection limits...|$|E
