40|$|The {{significance}} of insulin antibodies in determining diabetic control was examined in 56 patients treated with insulin. Diurnal changes in blood glucose, serum free insulin and bound insulin concentrations were measured. C-peptide concentrations {{before and after}} meals were measured as an index of residual insulin secretion. The control of blood glucose was estimated by the calculation of M-value (Schrichtkrull). The SD/mean of serum free insulin in patients with high insulin antibody titers was significantly lowered. This finding suggests that insulin antibodies have a <b>buffer</b> <b>action</b> of stabilization of serum free insulin. The <b>buffer</b> <b>action</b> of the insulin antibodies was affected by quantitative changes of bound insulin concentrations, which were accompanied by concomitant changes in free insulin concentrations within physiological limits.

In patients with antibodies of high <b>buffer</b> <b>action,</b> diurnal blood glucose levels were stable. Insulin antibodies seem to have a stabilizing action of blood glucose levels.

Since PC spine morphology is altered in adult CB-/- mice (longer necks, larger spine head volume), we summoned that morphological compensation/adaptation mechanisms might also be induced in CB-/- PC axon collaterals including boutons. In these mice, biocytin-filled PC reconstructions revealed that the number of axonal varicosities per PC axon collateral was augmented, mostly confined to the granule cell layer. Additionally, the volume of individual boutons was increased, evidenced from z-stacks of confocal images. EM analysis of PC-PC synapses revealed an enhancement in active zone (AZ) length by approximately 23 %, paralleled by a higher number of docked vesicles per AZ in CB-/- boutons. Moreover, synaptic cleft width was larger in CB-/- (23. 8 ± 0. 43 nm) compared to wild type (21. 17 ± 0. 39 nm) synapses. We propose that the morphological changes, i. e. the larger bouton volume, the enhanced AZ length and the higher number of docked vesicles, in combination with the increase in synaptic cleft width likely modifies the GABA release properties at this synapse in CB-/- mice.

Membrane bound proton pumps and proton translocating ATPsynthases are coupled by lateral proton flow. Whether it leads through the aqueous bulk phases (chemiosmotic theory) or whether it is confined to the membrane or the membrane water interface, is still controversial. Another related controversy is whether or not proton diffusion along the interface between a phospholipid membrane and water is enhanced over the one in bulk water. Thylakoid membranes of plant chloroplasts are intrinsically closely apposed (≈ 5 nm). To study lateral proton diffusion along the narrow interfacial domain between adjacent thylakoid membranes, we stimulated the proton pumps by a flash of light. This generates an alkalinization jump. In the absence of ADP the membrane is relatively proton tight. Therefore, the alkalinization jump relaxes into the medium.

Here, we examine presynaptic residual calcium (Cares) transients in individual presynaptic boutons of cerebellar granule cells at near-physiological tem-peratures using two-photonmicroscopy. Properties of Cares {{under conditions of}} zero-added buffer were determined bymeasuring Cares transients while loading boutons to a steady-state indicator concentration. These experiments revealed that, {{in the absence of}} exogenous calcium <b>buffers,</b> a single <b>action</b> potential evokes transients of Cares that vary widely in different boutons both in amplitude (400 – 900 nM) and time course (25 – 55 ms). Variation in calcium influx density, endogenous buffer capacity, and calcium extrusion density contribute to differences in Cares among boutons. Heterogeneity in Cares within different boutons suggests that plasticity can be regulated indepen-dently at different synapses arising froman individual granule cell. In a given bouton, Cares signals were highly reproducible from trial to trial and failures of calcium influxwere not observed. We find that a factor contributing to this reliability is that an action potential opens a large number of calcium channels (20 – 125) in a bouton. Presynaptic calcium signals were also used to assess the ability of granule cell axons to convey somatically generatedactionpotentials todistant synapses. In response topairs of actionpotentials or trains, granule cell boutons showed a remarkable ability to respond reliably at frequencies up to 500 Hz.

Objective: This study aimed to fill gaps in the understanding of care transitions from the perspectives of individuals with dementia and their informal caregivers through the development of a theoretical framework outlining factors that contribute to the processes care transitions in this population. Research questions addressed what was important to persons with dementia and their caregivers as they moved throughout the health care system as well as the challenges that they faced during health care system transitions. Methods: Constructivist grounded theory methods were used to build an understanding of the care transitions of persons with dementia and their caregivers. Individual or dyad interviews were conducted, recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Through initial and focused coding, themes and relationships between themes emerged and framework development began. Data collection and analysis occurred iteratively until saturation was reached. Results and Discussion: A three-part theoretical framework outlining the context, processes and influencing factors of care transitions emerged from the data. Elements of context included the existence of multiple realities and goals among those involved in transitions, the broader community, and the parallel experiences of others navigating the system. Phases of transition processes experienced during the dementia journey were a transition into the dementia care system, a continuous process of management and follow-up, and the adjustment to a new home. Four categories of influencing factors were described by participants: catalysts (causes of transitions), <b>buffers</b> (intermediary <b>actions</b> to ease future transitions), facilitators (factors that help transitions), and obstacles (factors that hinder transitions). This study suggests that transitions are complex; there is no single, simple remedy for the challenges of transitions. However, gaining an in depth understanding of the care transitions of individuals with dementia is an important step in improving transitions for this population. Knowledge translation and significance: The results of the study may be useful in the creation of recommendations for improving the care transition experiences of individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Furthermore, the consultations contributed to dementia strategy development in Ontario. Transitional periods represent a time of risk for adverse events and a high level of caregiver stress; therefore, this study has the potential {{to improve the quality of}} care and quality of life of persons with dementia and their informal caregivers...|$|R
