40|$|This article {{proposes a}} {{simulation}} of cutting forces in <b>broaching</b> <b>of</b> fir tree slots. Every step {{needed to build}} an in-house fir tree broaching simulation is presented. This simulation {{is based on the}} discretization of each tooth <b>of</b> the <b>broach,</b> computation <b>of</b> elementary cutting forces of each discretized section, and finally the summation of each elementary cutting force into a global axes system. This work also presents orthogonal cutting experiments to implement realistic specific cutting forces into the model. The simulation obtained is compared with the real force signals of a fir tree broach to evaluate the quality of the simulation. At the end, the application to industrial context is developed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOne major {{application}} <b>of</b> <b>broaching</b> is {{the production}} of internal gears for the automotive industry. Today, broaching with tools made of high speed steel is state of the art. However, because of the low hot hardness the cutting parameters are limited and process lubrication is mandatory. A promising alternative {{is the use of}} the carbon free cutting material MC 90 Intermet, which possesses a higher hot hardness and increased thermal conductivity compared to HSS. These properties offer dry <b>broaching</b> <b>of</b> gears with modules higher than mn = 1. 5 mm. In this paper, the influence of different coatings and cutting parameters on the tool wear, cutting forces and tool temperatures are investigated...|$|R

50|$|In 1940 Admiral Sir Max Kennedy Horton (later Commander-in-Chief Western Approaches Command) <b>broached</b> {{the concept}} <b>of</b> rescue <b>ships</b> with the Admiralty. The concept {{was to have}} {{merchant}} vessels that would accompany convoys but not carry cargo; they would instead have the role of saving the lives <b>of</b> seamen from <b>ships</b> sunk by enemy action. The rescue ship would take its position {{at the rear of}} one of the central columns <b>of</b> <b>ships.</b> From this position it could observe damaged <b>ships</b> falling astern <b>of</b> the convoy and quickly rendezvous to transfer survivors. The rescue ships would also be able to prove surgical or other treatment as required. This would free the cargo vessels of the convoy to continue on their way, and escorts to focus on countering the attacking U-boats or aircraft.|$|R
