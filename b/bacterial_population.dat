One important aspect of gut health is the totality of <b>bacterial</b> <b>populations</b> inhabiting different sites of the avian gastrointestinal tract, and associations of these populations with the poultry farm environment, since these bacteria are thought to drive metabolism and prime the developing host immune system. In this study, a single flock of commercial turkeys was followed {{over the course of}} twelve weeks to examine bacterial microbiome inhabiting the ceca, ileum, and corresponding poultry litter. Furthermore, the effects of low-dose, growth-promoting penicillin treatment (50 g/ton) in feed on the ileum bacterial microbiome were also examined during the early brood period. The cecum and ileum bacterial communities of turkeys were distinct, yet shifted in parallel to one another over time during bird maturation. Corresponding poultry litter was also distinct yet more closely represented the ileal <b>bacterial</b> <b>populations</b> than cecal <b>bacterial</b> <b>populations,</b> and also changed parallel to ileum <b>bacterial</b> <b>populations</b> over time. Penicillin applied at low dose in feed significantly enhanced early weight gain in commercial poults, and this correlated with predictable shifts in the ileum <b>bacterial</b> <b>populations</b> in control versus treatment groups. Overall, this study identified the dynamics of the turkey gastrointestinal microbiome during development, correlations between <b>bacterial</b> <b>populations</b> in the gastrointestinal tract and the litter environment, and the impact of low-dose penicillin on modulation of bacterial communities in the ileum.

2500|$|In a {{conventional}} molecular cloning experiment, the DNA to be cloned is obtained from an organism of interest, then treated with enzymes {{in the test}} tube to generate smaller DNA fragments. Subsequently, these fragments are then combined with vector DNA to generate recombinant DNA molecules. The recombinant DNA is then introduced into a host organism (typically an easy-to-grow, benign, laboratory strain of E. coli bacteria). This will generate a population of organisms in which recombinant DNA molecules are replicated along with the host DNA. Because they contain foreign DNA fragments, these are transgenic or genetically modified microorganisms (GMO). This process {{takes advantage of the}} fact that a single bacterial cell can be induced to take up and replicate a single recombinant DNA molecule. This single cell can then be expanded exponentially to generate a large amount of bacteria, each of which contain copies of the original recombinant molecule. Thus, both the resulting <b>bacterial</b> <b>population,</b> and the recombinant DNA molecule, are commonly referred to as [...] "clones". Strictly speaking, recombinant DNA refers to DNA molecules, while molecular cloning refers to the experimental methods used to assemble them. The idea arose that different DNA sequences could be inserted into a plasmid and that these foreign sequences would be carried into bacteria and digested as part of the plasmid. That is, these plasmids could serve as cloning vectors to carry genes.|$|E

Metabolic fingerprint patterns revealed that functional activities of culturable fecal bacteria were affected by the presence of tannins.

Bacteria were present in all samples, and populations decreased gradually with depth. However, divided/dividing cells were absent in some samples below 70 mbsf.

Bacterial profiles at both sites indicated that <b>bacterial</b> <b>populations</b> could be related to changes in the lithostratigraphy. Zones of frequent, small turbidites coupled with bioturbation and zones of massive mud flows or slumps were generally associated with unusually constant bacterial profiles.

For this paper we investigated if the wave-like fluctuations in <b>bacterial</b> <b>populations</b> could be explained by their interactions with populations of bacterial-feeding nematodes (BFN). In two microcosm experiments, soil bacterial populations-colony forming units (CFUs) and microscopic counts of stained bacteria and nematode populations in 22 families were monitored daily for 25 or 30 days after incorporation of clover + grass (CG) plant material into soil. In another microcosm experiment, dynamics of bacteria and nematode populations were monitored in response to gamma-irradiated plant material added to gamma-irradiated soil mixed with filtered bacterial suspensions and in non-irradiated soil. In the first experiment, soil <b>bacterial</b> <b>populations</b> fluctuated significantly after incorporation of the plant material with two peaks within the first week and three or four smaller peaks thereafter. Populations of total nematodes and BFN started to increase in the second week after CG incorporation, but the proportion of BFN increased within 1 week. Inactive juvenile BFN (dauerlarvae) seemed to be activated after 2 days (as the percentage of Rhabditidae increased and dauerlarvae decreased), followed by stepwise increases in dauerlarvae every 4 days, indicating that there was a new generation every 4 days. There were significant wave-like fluctuations in daily population changes of BFN, but not for those of total nematode communities, over the duration of these experiments. These fluctuations had similar periods (5 days) as those of <b>bacterial</b> <b>populations,</b> but were shifted about 3 days relative to the bacterial fluctuations. Gamma-irradiation of soil significantly increased the periods and amplitudes of <b>bacterial</b> oscillations. Nematode <b>populations</b> were eliminated in gamma-irradiated soils, but small numbers of protozoa were accidentally introduced in the irradiated soil, and may have been partially responsible for the delayed regulation of bacterial growth. We conclude that fluctuations in <b>bacterial</b> <b>populations</b> were not directly related to similar fluctuations in populations of BFN, as expected from classical Lotka-Volterra equations for predator-prey relationships, but were related to changes in growth rates of BFN. An alternation in active and inactive stages in a synchronized predator community after a disturbance could allow periods of bacterial growth alternated with periods of death. Fluctuations in <b>bacterial</b> <b>populations</b> were dampened after a much longer period when the soil fauna was largely eliminated. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
