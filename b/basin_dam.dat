To this end, the multivariable method was used to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation of the water surface quality of the Koudiat Medouar dam, eastern Algeria. The stiff diagram has identified two main hydrochemical facies. The first facies Mg-HCO 3 is reflected in the first sampling station (Oued Reboa) and in the second one (Oued Timgad), while the second facies Mg-SO 4 is reflected in the third station (<b>Basin</b> <b>Dam).</b> The results obtained by the analysis of variance show that in the three stations all parameters are significant, except for Na, K and HCO 3 in the first station (Oued Reboa) and the EC in the second station (Oued Timgad) and at the end NO 3 and pH in the third station (<b>Basin</b> <b>Dam).</b> Q-mode hierarchical cluster analysis showed that two main groups in each sampling station. The chemistry of major ions (Mg, Ca, HCO 3 and SO 4) within the three stations results from anthropogenic impacts and water–rock interaction sources.|$|E

40|$|Precipitation is {{the driving}} force {{affecting}} the temporal and spatial variability of many hydrosystem responses, e. g., drainage <b>basin,</b> <b>dam</b> and sewer networks. When the reliability or sensitivity of such systems is concerned, simulation study is usually utilized to generate synthesized rainfall sequence for model input. Since long-term physical models of rainfall are not easily accessible, most of the current adopted models to synthesize rainfall sequence are essentially empirical and descriptive, and they fall into either parametric or nonparametric category, or mixture of the two. No consensus, however, is achieved regarding their appropriateness in application. Motivated by the above problem, this study aims to provide an insightful investigation into these two classes of methods and especially detail the advantages of nonparametric methods in the context of hydrological engineering. We propose that a reasonable rainfall sequence generation mechanism should be based on past observations, faithful in the probabilistic sense and infinitely producible. Based on these realizations, argument of this thesis is developed. First, it is pointed out the parametric models, imposing structural information, may inappropriately represent the data, termed ‘mis-specification’. On the contrary, the nonparametric method is in general asymptotically consistent. Chapters 1, 2 and 3 are related to this topic. Moreover, we investigate two nonparametric methods in detail, especially their finite sample performance. This is mainly through simulation study. For one of them, termed ‘Taylor-Thompson method’, we provide its global property in close form and propose a data-based smoothing parameter selection method. We also address that in multi-dimension, nonparametric-based generation of random vector is more natural. We find no method universally outperforms the other one in preserving all the characteristics of sample, so selection of two methods depends on issue of interest. These topics are included in Chapter 3. At last, an example is given in Chapter 4 for illustrative purpose. Artificial rainfall sequences are generated by the two nonparametric methods under investigation. The sequence is combined in a rainfall-runoff-routing model, with downstream flood the ultimate focus. The difference of model outputs is examined in the engineering point of view.
