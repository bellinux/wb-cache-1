50|$|At about 1448 on Wednesday 5 March 2008, {{a double}} road-train loaded with bulk cement {{drove into the}} path of a train that was {{conveying}} four empty fuel tankers at the Stirling Street level crossing, Birkenhead. The impact speed of both the train and road-train was low (about 15 km/h) but nevertheless sufficient to roll the prime mover and the first semitrailer onto their sides and to derail the lead bogie of the train's locomotive. The road-train <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> slightly injured; the two train <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaken</b> but otherwise unhurt.|$|R
40|$|Conflicts in distributing {{public space}} in {{residential}} areas. Ideas {{of justice and}} fairness held by competing pressure interest groups. Often the design and arrangement of public spaces within residential areas is decided upon top-down usually by politicians. The involved city and traffic planners often fail to anticipate social, ecological and economical consequences. In order to be accepted city and traffic planning needs the participation of citizens. Top-down decision making in these areas of public interest often violates ideas of justice and fairness held by citizens. Therefore results of public space distribution in residential areas e. g. concerning car and <b>bicycle</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>are</b> either hesitantly {{or not at all}} implemented. The empirical part of this doctoral thesis focuses on an analysis of ideas of justice and fairness held by different user groups (e. g. pedestrians, car and <b>bicycle</b> <b>drivers)</b> and different groups of actors (e. g. citizens, enterprises, city and traffic planners of government and non-government organizations). A new investigation method was developed. A physical model (with miniature houses made of wood, playmobil figures, wooden cars, pedestrians, front yards, road signs etc.) showing a street within a residential area was used for group discussions among citizens about ideas of justice and fairness concerning distribution conflicts. Starting point of the investigation was the concept of sustainable development. The theoretical part of this doctoral thesis is interdisciplinary. It contains results of environmental research from the social sciences which are associated with theories of justice and fairness. Furthermore psychological, political-philosophical and sociological concepts of justice and fairness are presented...|$|R
50|$|A long-standing tenet {{has been}} for the larger vehicle {{involved}} in a collision to assume responsibility, e.g., if a car collides with a <b>bicycle</b> the car <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> at fault. If a bicycle and pedestrian collide it is the bicyclist's fault. Practically, this understanding emboldens pedestrians and cyclists to take liberties with cars and trucks, impeding their progress by moving into the flow of traffic under the assumption that larger vehicles will give way. This notwithstanding, the incidence of vehicle-pedestrian collisions is on the decline, {{despite the fact that the}} new Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China allows for only one case in which <b>drivers</b> <b>are</b> not at fault for hitting a pedestrian—that is, if the pedestrian purposely violates traffic laws.|$|R

She admits she was not driving the car, presents Wolfe with a $10,000 retainer for his expert advice, and promises to return the next day. First she must see someone, find out something. Wolfe accepts the retainer and warns Mrs. Fromm sternly about the danger of asking any questions herself, since two people have already been killed.|$|R
