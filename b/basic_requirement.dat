5|$|Not {{only was}} the supply of {{available}} aircraft poor, by the then Director of Organisation at the Air Ministry Charles Portal recognised {{there would be a}} future problem in procurement of aircraft. Coastal Command's operational nature would make twenty-four hour operations a <b>basic</b> <b>requirement.</b> Suitable aircraft for take-off and landing, in particular flying-boats, in all weather was vital for the safety of crews and the effectiveness of the Command. The new twin-engine Saro Lerwick had been touted as the ideal aircraft. It only came into service in April 1939 and was then found to be unsuitable. There was a need for long-range machines to cover the South-Western Approaches. In December 1939 to August 1940 the following reinforcements were sent: No. 10 Squadron RAAF received Sunderlands, No. 235 Squadron RAF, No. 236 Squadron RAF, No. 248 Squadron RAF and No. 254 Squadron RAF equipped with Bristol Blenheims from RAF Fighter Command in February 1940; in June 1940 No. 53 Squadron RAF and No. 59 Squadron RAFs with Blenheim on loan from RAF Bomber Command, and in August 1940, No. 98 Squadron RAF's Fairey Battles, also on loan from the Bomber Service and based in Iceland. By 15 June a further 15 squadrons were to have been handed over to Coastal Command, this was only achieved by the loan of seven squadrons from other commands, despite express agreement by the Air Ministry and Admiralty. The daily operational strength of Coastal Command amounted to 298 aircraft, most unsuitable for maritime operations. Within a month, that had risen to 39 squadrons and 612 aircraft. However they were made of 11 different types, causing training and conversion problems.|$|E

25|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} the Prime Minister's {{discretion}} under Article 49(1) of the Constitution as to the timing of an election to fill a casual vacancy is subject to judicial review. It is a <b>basic</b> <b>requirement</b> {{of the rule of}} law, that all discretionary power is subject to legal limits. However, the Court indicated that such judicial intervention would only be warranted in exceptional cases due to the fact-sensitive nature of the Prime Minister's discretion. Given the MP's role as the voice of the constituents, leaving a parliamentary seat vacant for too long could disenfranchise the residents of that constituency. Thus, there was a need to balance the Prime Minister's discretion as to the timing of the election and the rights of voters.|$|E
25|$|By 1983, {{membership}} of the PCR had risen to 3.3million, and, in 1989, to 3.7–3.8million—meaning that, in the end, over 20% of Romanian adults were party members, making the PCR the largest communist group of the Eastern Bloc after the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. 64,200 basic party units, answering to county committees, varying in number and representing various areas of Romanian society, were officially recorded in 1980. Statistics also indicated that, during {{the transition from the}} 1965 PMR (with 8% of the total population) to the 1988 PCR, the {{membership of}} workers had grown from 44 to 55%, while that of peasants had dropped from 34 to 15%. In the end, these records contrasted the fact that the PCR had become completely subservient to its leader and no longer had any form of autonomous activity, while membership became a <b>basic</b> <b>requirement</b> in numerous social contexts, leading to purely formal allegiances and political clientelism.|$|E

25|$|Finnish and Swedish are the {{official}} languages of the municipality of Helsinki. The majority, or 81.9% {{of the population}}, speaks Finnish as their native language. A minority, at 5.9%, speaks Swedish. Around 12.2% of the population speaks a native language other than Finnish or Swedish. Helsinki slang today combines influences mainly from Finnish and English, but has traditionally had strong Russian and Swedish influences. Finnish today is the common language of communication between Finnish speakers, Swedish speakers, and speakers of other languages (New Finns) in day-to-day affairs {{in the public sphere}} between unknown persons. In instances where a speaker's knowledge of Finnish is not known, English is usually spoken. Swedish is commonly spoken in city or national agencies specifically aimed at Finland-Swedish speakers, such as the Social Services Department on Hämeentie or the Luckan Cultural centre in Kamppi. Knowledge of Finnish is also essential in business and is usually a <b>basic</b> <b>requirement</b> in the employment market.|$|E
25|$|While the R.II was in storage, the Idflieg {{changed its}} {{requirements}} for the aircraft, requesting that the operational altitude be increased from , but hoping that even more altitude would be possible. Siemens-Schuckert responded that {{this would not be}} possible with the Mercedes engines recently approved for installation, and suggested three Benz D.IV engines inside the fuselage, augmented by two more of the same engine mounted pusher-fashion in the interplane gap. The Idflieg rejected this suggestion, insisting on the <b>basic</b> <b>requirement</b> of having the engines serviceable in flight. By the time that workers were available for the R.II again, in early 1917, Siemens-Schuckert had gained experience with the similar R.VII and attempted to meet the Idfliegs requirements by installing extra sections in the wing to extend it to six bays and thereby offset the extra weight of the new engines. The upper wings were replaced with a new design with greater chord, and the tail surfaces were enlarged. Finally, bomb racks were fitted to the wings that could carry either six 50-kg bombs or four 100-kg bombs.|$|E
