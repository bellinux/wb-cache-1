5|$|The {{asteroid}} <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly {{between the}} orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The asteroid <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids. About half {{the mass of the}} <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the asteroid <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200km).|$|E
5|$|Although Edinburgh is {{the capital}} of Scotland, the largest city is Glasgow, which has just over 584,000 inhabitants. The Greater Glasgow conurbation, with a {{population}} of almost 1.2million, is home to nearly a quarter of Scotland's population. The Central <b>Belt</b> <b>is</b> where most of the main towns and cities are located, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Perth. Scotland's only major city outside the Central <b>Belt</b> <b>is</b> Aberdeen.|$|E
5|$|Another high-inclination {{group in}} the inner part of the {{asteroid}} <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> the Phocaea family. These are composed primarily of S-type asteroids, whereas the neighboring Hungaria family includes some E-types. The Phocaea family orbit between 2.25 and 2.5 AU from the Sun.|$|E
50|$|Men's <b>belts</b> <b>were</b> {{known as}} tatua and women's as tu. The man's <b>belt</b> <b>was</b> usually the more ornate. <b>Belts</b> <b>were</b> usually made of flax but {{occasionally}} other materials were used such as kiekie and pingao. Flax <b>belts</b> <b>were</b> often plaited in patterns {{with black and}} white stripes. The belts tied with a string tie. Women often wore a belt composed of many strands of plaited fibre.|$|R
5000|$|The {{progressive}} {{ranks of}} karate {{are reflected in}} the different colored <b>belts.</b> There <b>are</b> two major classifications: the ranks of black <b>belt</b> <b>are</b> called dans, while all those below the rank of black <b>belt</b> <b>are</b> kyus.|$|R
40|$|The belts of the Lavinia Planitia {{region of}} Venus are {{discussed}} in detail with reference to high-resolution radar images from the Magellan spacecraft. Two types of deformation <b>belts</b> <b>are</b> identified: ridge <b>belts</b> and fracture <b>belts.</b> Ridge <b>belts</b> <b>are</b> composed of parallel ridges, each a few hundred meters in elevation, that are interpreted as folds. Typical fold spacings are 5 - 10 km. Fracture <b>belts</b> <b>are</b> dominated by intense faulting, with faults in some instances paired to form narrow grabens. The formation of ridge and fracture <b>belts</b> <b>is</b> explored using simple models...|$|R
5|$|At its fullest extent (but {{excluding}} the scattered disc), including its outlying regions, the Kuiper belt stretches from roughly 30 to 55 AU. The {{main body of}} the <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> generally accepted to extend from the 2:3 mean-motion resonance (see below) at 39.5 AU to the 1:2 resonance at roughly 48 AU. The Kuiper <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> quite thick, with the main concentration extending as much as ten degrees outside the ecliptic plane and a more diffuse distribution of objects extending several times farther. Overall it more resembles a torus or doughnut than a belt. Its mean position is inclined to the ecliptic by 1.86 degrees.|$|E
5|$|Glyphs are {{inscribed in}} a {{vertical}} orientation, {{even if the}} object depicted (e.g. fish, Orion’s <b>belt)</b> <b>is</b> usually seen horizontally. This serves the purposes of economy and aesthetic effect. The 'vertical rule' is important for interpreting the glyphs correctly, so it may have assisted in secrecy as well.|$|E
5|$|Inside the {{magnetosphere}} is the plasmasphere, a donut-shaped region containing low-energy charged particles, or plasma. This region {{begins at}} {{a height of}} 60km, extends up to 3 or 4 Earth radii, and includes the ionosphere. This region rotates with the Earth. There are also two concentric tire-shaped regions, called the Van Allen radiation belts, with high-energy ions (energies from 0.1 to 10million electron volts (MeV)). The inner <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> 1–2Earth radii out while the outer <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> at 4–7Earth radii. The plasmasphere and Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying greatly with solar activity.|$|E
50|$|At {{this point}} the <b>belt</b> <b>was</b> {{presented}} to Lieutenant Gordon and was kept by his family until, {{following the death of}} Captain Charles Upham, VC and Bar. The <b>belt</b> <b>was</b> renamed the Charles Upham Memorial Cavalry Champions <b>belt</b> and <b>was</b> formally put back into competition.|$|R
40|$|The {{arguments}} {{for and against}} the idea that most short-period comets originate in the Kuiper <b>belt</b> <b>are</b> discussed. Observational constraints {{on the distribution of}} mass in the Kuiper <b>belt</b> <b>are</b> reviewed as well as a model of the physical conditions that now exist. Finally, predictions from this model about the detectability of the Kuiper <b>belt</b> <b>are</b> compared to optical surveys...|$|R
5000|$|On February 1, 2014, Belt {{signed a}} one-year $2.9 million {{contract}} to avoid arbitration. [...] On May 9, while batting at Dodger Stadium, <b>Belt</b> <b>was</b> hit {{on his left}} thumb by Dodgers pitcher Paul Maholm, suffering a broken thumb. [...] <b>Belt</b> <b>was</b> activated from the disabled list on July 4, only {{to return to the}} disabled list on July 21 after suffering a concussion while fielding during batting practice. <b>Belt</b> <b>was</b> activated August 2, but was placed on the DL again August 8 when his concussion symptoms continued. [...] <b>Belt</b> <b>was</b> reactivated from the disabled list on September 15.|$|R
5|$|The {{asteroid}} belt occupies the orbit between Mars and Jupiter, between 2.3 and 3.3AU from the Sun. It {{is thought to}} be remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter. The {{asteroid belt}} contains tens of thousands, possibly millions, of objects over one kilometre in diameter. Despite this, the total mass of the asteroid <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> unlikely {{to be more than a}} thousandth of that of Earth. The asteroid <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> very sparsely populated; spacecraft routinely pass through without incident.|$|E
5|$|Skirting {{the outer}} edge of the {{asteroid}} <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> the Cybele group, orbiting between 3.3 and 3.5AU. These have a 7:4 orbital resonance with Jupiter. The Hilda family orbit between 3.5 and 4.2AU, and have relatively circular orbits and a stable 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter. There are few asteroids beyond 4.2AU, until Jupiter's orbit. Here the two families of Trojan asteroids can be found, which, at least for objects larger than 1km, are approximately as numerous as the asteroids of the asteroid belt.|$|E
5|$|The Bible <b>Belt</b> <b>is</b> an {{informal}} {{term for a}} region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative Evangelical Protestantism is {{a significant part of}} the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average. By contrast, religion plays the least important role in New England and in the Western United States.|$|E
50|$|The last {{observation}} {{of this system}} for a dust disc or comet <b>belt</b> <b>was</b> in 2009 by the Spitzer Space Telescope; a <b>belt</b> <b>was</b> inferred at 102 AU. It has an inclination of 48◦.|$|R
50|$|Flat <b>belts</b> <b>were</b> {{traditionally}} made {{of leather}} or fabric. Today most {{are made of}} rubber or synthetic polymers. Grip of leather <b>belts</b> <b>is</b> often better if they are assembled with the hair side (outer side) of the leather against the pulley, although some <b>belts</b> <b>are</b> instead given a half-twist before joining the ends (forming a Möbius strip), so that wear can be evenly distributed {{on both sides of}} the <b>belt.</b> <b>Belts</b> ends <b>are</b> joined by lacing the ends together with leather thonging (the oldest of the methods), steel comb fasteners and/or lacing, or by gluing or welding (in the case of polyurethane or polyester). Flat <b>belts</b> <b>were</b> traditionally jointed, and still usually are, but they can also be made with endless construction.|$|R
50|$|Zale was a 1991 inductee in the Boxing Hall of Fame. In November 2015, his {{championship}} <b>belts</b> <b>were</b> {{stolen from}} the IBHOF. The <b>belts</b> <b>were</b> on loan from Zale's family, and {{have yet to be}} returned.|$|R
5|$|The Kuiper <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> a great ring {{of debris}} {{similar to the}} {{asteroid}} belt, but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice. It extends between 30 and 50AU from the Sun. Though it is estimated to contain anything from dozens to thousands of dwarf planets, it is composed mainly of small Solar System bodies. Many of the larger Kuiper belt objects, such as Quaoar, Varuna, and Orcus, {{may prove to be}} dwarf planets with further data. There are estimated to be over 100,000 Kuiper belt objects with a diameter greater than 50km, but the total mass of the Kuiper <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> thought to be only a tenth or even a hundredth the mass of Earth. Many Kuiper belt objects have multiple satellites, and most have orbits that take them outside the plane of the ecliptic.|$|E
5|$|The {{total mass}} of the {{asteroid}} <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> estimated to be 2.8×1021 to 3.2×1021 kilograms, which is just 4% of the {{mass of the}} Moon. The four largest objects, Ceres, 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, and 10 Hygiea, account for half of the belt's total mass, with almost one-third accounted for by Ceres alone.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic {{activity}} in the <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> usually linked to the dehydration of the subducting slabs, which causes water and other subducted components {{to be added to}} the overlying mantle. In the case of the CVZ, this addition generates magmas that are further modified by the thick crust in the area, forming andesites, dacites and rhyolites.|$|E
50|$|Toothed <b>belts</b> <b>are</b> used {{widely in}} {{mechanical}} devices, including sewing machines, photocopiers and many others. A major use of toothed <b>belts</b> <b>is</b> as the timing belt {{used to drive}} the camshafts within an automobile or motorcycle engine.|$|R
500|$|Hansas armor {{consisted}} of teak-backed wrought iron, which was manufactured in Great Britain. Her armored <b>belt</b> <b>was</b> [...] thick amidships, where it protected the ship's vitals. On {{the bow and}} stern, the <b>belt</b> <b>was</b> reduced to [...] in thickness. The entire <b>belt</b> <b>was</b> backed with [...] of timber. The casemates were armored with 114mm thick sloping iron plates. The lower battery casemate had 114mm thick transverse armored bulkheads on {{either end of the}} side armor.|$|R
50|$|Gait <b>belts</b> <b>are</b> worn {{around a}} patient's waist. Their {{purpose is to}} put less strain on the lumbar spine of the care giver(s) who support the patient. Gait <b>belts</b> <b>are</b> used in nursing homes, hospitals, or other similar facilities.|$|R
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} imagery, the {{asteroid}} <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> mostly empty. The asteroids are spread over {{such a large}} volume {{that it would be}} improbable to reach an asteroid without aiming carefully. Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known, and the total number ranges in the millions or more, depending on the lower size cutoff. Over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100km, and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that the asteroid belt has 0.7–1.7 million asteroids with a diameter of 1km or more. The apparent magnitudes of most of the known asteroids are 11–19, with the median at about 16.|$|E
5|$|In {{the north}} of the {{constellation}} is the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, a dark molecular cloud with many embedded reflection nebulae, including NGC 6729, NGC 6726–7, and IC 4812. A star-forming region of around , it contains Herbig–Haro objects (protostars) and some very young stars. About 430 light years (130 parsecs) away, {{it is one of the}} closest star-forming regions to the Solar System. The related NGC 6726 and 6727, along with unrelated NGC 6729, were first recorded by Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt in 1865. The Coronet cluster, about 554 light years (170 parsecs) away at the edge of the Gould <b>Belt,</b> <b>is</b> also used in studying star and protoplanetary disk formation.|$|E
5|$|Moons in {{retrograde}} orbits cannot form in {{the same}} region of the solar nebula as the planets they orbit, so Triton must have been captured from elsewhere. It might therefore have originated in the Kuiper belt, a ring of small icy objects extending outwards from just inside the orbit of Neptune to about 50AU from the Sun. Thought to be the point of origin {{for the majority of}} short-period comets observed from Earth, the <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> also home to several large, planet-like bodies including Pluto, which is now recognized as the largest in a population of Kuiper belt objects (the plutinos) locked in orbital step with Neptune. Triton is only slightly larger than Pluto and nearly identical in composition, which has led to the hypothesis that the two share a common origin.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it is thought}} by some that belting will produce nodules. This may <b>be</b> true if <b>belting</b> <b>is</b> done incorrectly. Many in the musical theatre {{industry}} like to quip, [...] "belting is not bad; bad <b>belting</b> <b>is</b> bad." ...|$|R
50|$|Arthur Elmer <b>Belt</b> <b>was</b> born April 10, 1893. He {{earned a}} bachelor's {{degree from the}} University of California, Berkeley in 1916, a master's in 1917 and a doctorate's in 1920. <b>Belt</b> <b>was</b> {{a member of the}} first class taught by Herbert McLean Evans.|$|R
50|$|Hansas armor {{consisted}} of teak-backed wrought iron, which was manufactured in Great Britain. Her armored <b>belt</b> <b>was</b> 152 mm thick amidships, where it protected the ship's vitals. On {{the bow and}} stern, the <b>belt</b> <b>was</b> reduced to 114 mm in thickness. The entire <b>belt</b> <b>was</b> backed with 306 mm of timber. The casemates were armored with 114 mm thick sloping iron plates. The lower battery casemate had 114 mm thick transverse armored bulkheads on {{either end of the}} side armor.|$|R
5|$|Neptune's orbit has a {{profound}} impact on the region directly beyond it, known as the Kuiper belt. The Kuiper <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30AU out to about 55AU from the Sun. Much {{in the same way that}} Jupiter's gravity dominates the asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates the Kuiper belt. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in the Kuiper belt's structure. The region between 40 and 42AU is an example.|$|E
5|$|Nevado del Ruiz {{lies within}} the Pacific Ring of Fire, {{a region that}} encircles the Pacific Ocean and {{contains}} some of the world's most active volcanoes. It is the third most northerly of the volcanoes lying in the North Volcanic Zone of the Andean Volcanic Belt, which contains 75 of the 204 Holocene-age volcanoes in South America. The Andean Volcanic <b>Belt</b> <b>is</b> produced by the eastward subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate beneath the South American continental plate. As {{is the case for}} many subduction-zone volcanoes, Nevado del Ruiz can generate explosive Plinian eruptions with associated pyroclastic flows that can melt snow and glaciers near the summit, producing large and sometimes devastating lahars (mud and debris flows).|$|E
5|$|Observations {{with the}} James Clerk Maxwell Telescope at a {{wavelength}} of 850μm show an extended flux of radiation {{out to an}} angular radius of 35arcseconds around Epsilon Eridani. The peak emission occurs at an angular radius of 18arcseconds, which corresponds to a radius of about 60AU. The highest level of emission occurs over the radius 35–75 AU from Epsilon Eridani and is substantially reduced inside 30AU. This emission is interpreted as coming from a young analogue of the Solar System's Kuiper belt: a compact dusty disk structure surrounding Epsilon Eridani. From Earth, this <b>belt</b> <b>is</b> viewed at an inclination of roughly 25° {{to the line of}} sight.|$|E
50|$|The Evstafi-class ships used Krupp armour. The maximum {{thickness}} of the waterline <b>belt</b> <b>was</b> 9 in which reduced to 7 - 8 in abreast the magazines. It covered about 157 ft of the ship's length. The <b>belt</b> <b>was</b> 7 ft high, including 4 ft below the waterline. The belt terminated in 7 in transverse bulkheads. The <b>belt</b> <b>was</b> extended to the bow by armour plates 3 - 4 in thick and to the stern by 2 - 3 in armour.|$|R
50|$|They are {{generally}} made from carbon Steel or stainless steel. Stainless steel <b>belts</b> <b>are</b> corrosion resistant and provide excellent surface quality. Stainless steel <b>belts</b> <b>are</b> used {{primarily in the}} chemical, food, rubber, plastic, wood, and laminate industries. Carbon steel <b>belts</b> <b>are</b> energy efficient and ideal for applications necessitating radiant heating of products or in high-temperature applications that might exceed the annealing temperatures of stainless steel belts also carbon steel belts can more evenly distributed heat since most stainless steel alloys are comparatively poor heat conductors. Carbon steel <b>belts</b> <b>are</b> used primarily in food processing, transport, and bake ovens. Textured Steel is also a commonly found belt material. The main purpose of using textured steel material is for its non-stick capabilities. This works well in the laminate industry.|$|R
50|$|Tri Sviatitelia was {{the first}} Russian ship to use Harvey armour. The armour was made by Vickers in Britain {{as well as the}} French firms of Schneider et Cie and Saint Chamond. The maximum {{thickness}} of the waterline <b>belt</b> <b>was</b> 18 in which reduced to 16 in abreast the magazines. This was the thickest armour ever carried by a Russian battleship. It covered 246 ft of the ship's length. The <b>belt</b> <b>was</b> 8 ft high, and tapered down to a thickness of 9 in at the bottom edge. The upper 18 in of the <b>belt</b> <b>was</b> intended to be above the waterline, but the ship was overweight and much of the <b>belt</b> <b>was</b> submerged. The <b>belt</b> terminated in 14 - 16 in transverse bulkheads.|$|R
