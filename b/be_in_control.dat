5|$|Browne was {{regarded}} as an intelligent and meticulous athlete, who was known for a logical and somewhat introspective style in his approach to the sport. He felt {{that he did not}} have the raw speed to match the likes of Lionel Cox and Dick Ploog in vying for selection in Australia's sprint team, and that he was not suited to long road races, instead focusing on medium length track racing. Browne typically was the front rider in tandem races, liking to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control.</b> He {{was regarded}} to be a cyclist who behaved in a careful and scholarly manner, and was known for coaxing higher levels of performance out of his younger partners. Browne was respected for his technical knowledge of the tandem and his success was often attributed to his vast experience.|$|E
5|$|In 1987 France took on pre-tournament favourites Australia at Concord Oval for a {{place in}} the final. In one of the {{greatest}} World Cup matches, the Australians appeared to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control,</b> leading 9–0, 15–12 and 24–21 at various stages of the match, only for the French to keep coming back. With the scores locked at 24–24 and the prospect of extra time looming, the French scored {{one of the most memorable}} tries in rugby history. Starting an attack from inside their own half, the French passed the ball through 11 pairs of hands before fullback Serge Blanco beat Wallabies hooker Tom Lawton to score a try in the corner. France won 30–24, and would face co-hosts New Zealand in the final at Eden Park. The French had not fully recovered from their magnificent effort in the semi-final, and New Zealand won the anti-climactic decider 29–9.|$|E
5|$|The Australians seized {{their good}} fortune and set their fastest time to date with 11.0seconds (s). Having been beaten twice after leading out, the Australians sat back before {{sweeping}} past the Germans and Americans {{in the final}} lap. Australia were again drawn against South Africa in their quarter-final, who had defeated them easily in the heats. This time they equalled the fastest team in the competition over the final 200m, clocking 10.8s to progress to the final, where they faced the Italy. Giuseppe Ogna and Cesare Pinarello appeared to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> {{at the start of}} the final lap. They had moved alongside the Australians with one and a half laps to go, but the Australians surprised them {{at the start of the}} final lap. The Italians came back to pull level at the start of the back straight, but the Australians held them off and pulled away to win by a length and a half. The Italians lodged a protest for interference but it was dismissed. The Australians finished in a time of 10.8s and Browne later claimed that he was convinced by the performance that they would win the gold medal.|$|E

40|$|Locus {{of control}} is a {{personality}} variable that reflects a person 2 ̆ 7 s general beliefs about {{whether he or she}} <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> or whether external forces <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>control.</b> Individuals who believe they <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> arc called internals, whereas people who believe that external forces (luck, fate, or powerful others) <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> arc called externals. Studies of locus of control originate from the field of social psychology - specifically within the framework of social learning theory developed by J. B. Rotter (1954, 1966). The concept of locus of control addresses assumptions about one 2 ̆ 7 s responsibility for good or bad events. Internals attribute events in their lives to their own actions, motivations, or competencies, whereas externals attribute events to outside forces such as luck, chance, or powerful others...|$|R

There were several points of difference, the most obvious being Iraq placed in the British red area and less obviously, the idea that British and French advisors would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> of the area designated as being for an Arab State. Lastly, while the correspondence made no mention of Palestine, Haifa and Acre were to be British and the brown area (a reduced Palestine) internationalised.|$|E

25|$|There is one {{fundamental}} lesson we {{must learn}} from this experience: electricity is really different from everything else. It cannot be stored, it cannot be seen, and we cannot do without it, which makes opportunities {{to take advantage of}} a deregulated market endless. It is a public good that must be protected from private abuse. If Murphy's Law were written for a market approach to electricity, then the law would state 'any system that can be gamed, will be gamed, and at the worst possible time.' And a market approach for electricity is inherently gameable. Never again can we allow private interests to create artificial or even real shortages and to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

25|$|Waugh {{was seeking}} to force {{his way into the}} Australian team {{at the start of the}} 1988–89 season. He started poorly, with a duck and 18 against Queensland and not taking a wicket. In the next match he made a duck and {{appeared}} to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> in the second innings when he was run out for 46. He then faced the touring West Indies, Waugh was dismissed for nine in the first innings. In the second innings, Waugh bounced back to score an unbeaten 103 from 163 balls against the undisputed world champions, earning praise from their captain Viv Richards. In the following match against Tasmania, Waugh was immediately out for a duck attempting a cut shot, but made 100 not out in the second innings. He then scored 69 and 39 against Western Australia. Waugh was overlooked for Test selection, but was selected in the ODI squad for the start of the triangular tournament against the West Indies and Pakistan. It was to be the first time that twins played international cricket for Australia.|$|E
25|$|On Green Bay's {{first drive}} {{of the second}} half, they reached the Lions 38-yard line, only to lose the ball when Edgar Bennett was tackled for no gain by Willie Clay on fourth and 1. On the next play, Krieg's 36-yard {{completion}} to Herman Moore moved {{the ball to the}} Dallas 25, and Hanson eventually finished the drive by squeezing a 38-yard field goal inside the left upright, cutting Detroit's deficit to 10-3 with 5:58 left in the third quarter. Green Bay struck back with a 28-yard field goal by Jacke, set up by Favre's 26-yard completion to Robert Brooks, regaining a two-score advantage at 13-3. With time running out in the third quarter, Green Bay appeared to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> of the game, but Detroit finally caught a break as Mel Gray returned the ensuing kickoff a franchise playoff record 68 yards to the Packers 18-yard line. Krieg eventually cashed in the big return with a 3-yard pass to Perriman, cutting the deficit to 13–10 with 13:35 left in the game.|$|E
25|$|England headed over to India in 2008 for {{the final}} tour of the year. Optimism was high {{following}} the demolition of South Africa in the ODI series, as much was expected ahead of Kevin Pietersen's first full Test series as captain. The tour started with seven ODI's. England were heavily defeated in the first match, with India posting 387/5 in their 50 overs. England could only manage 229 and the result lead to criticism due to {{the manner of the}} defeat. England improved in the second match although they still lost by 54 runs, although this time they had restricted India to 292. England narrowly lost the third ODI, losing on the DL Method by 16 runs. England lost the fourth ODI on the DL Method again, this time by 19 runs. Both results were controversial as England looked to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> in both games and would have probably gone on to win. However, England were now 4-0 down with just three games left to play, meaning they had lost the series. The fifth ODI, resulted in a six wicket defeat for England. After England had posted 270/4, India chased it down within 44 overs. The final two games of the series were cancelled following the 2008 Mumbai attacks.|$|E

25|$|Antony and Cleopatra {{was never}} {{intended}} to be a tragedy; instead, Shakespeare gave the illusion of the tragedy as the two protagonists set out to become the heroes of the play and neither succeeded. Antony and Cleopatra are seen to have a passionate love for each other up till their demise as both are seen ending their lives for the other. Although the couple was seen as a pair that could not live without the other, it does not take much to be able {{to point out that the}} basis of their relationship lies on manipulation and lust. Enobarbus was able to see this as he never believed their love was true but instead a contradiction. Cleopatra always wanted Antony to be in the palm of her hands, to always <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> of his emotions and would thus manipulate him by dancing whenever he was sad or fake a sickness if he were to be happy. This makes Antony only chase after Cleopatra even more in a never-ending cycle. They both try to be much more than they are and show their enemies and the world that they are invincible. Rather than them sacrificing themselves for the other, the two protagonists set out to become the hero of the play and to show that being the last one standing, no hand will bring them down but their own. They did not die for love but for the fame that would come behind that sacrifice and in the end are seen as being noble and self-sacrificing. It does not end in a tragedy but in a bittersweet and almost happy ending.|$|E
