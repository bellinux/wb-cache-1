He loves meat, woodworking, hunting, whisky, and breakfast foods. He hates and fears his two ex-wives, both named Tammy, {{one of whom is}} played by Offerman's real-life wife, Megan Mullally. Ron claims not to <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> personal lives of those around him but actually cares a great deal about his colleagues, and has a particularly strong respect for Leslie.|$|E
5|$|In the UK in 2005, Lawson {{started to}} host a daytime {{television}} chat show on ITV1 called Nigella, on which celebrity guests joined her in a studio kitchen. The first episode debuted with a disappointing 800,000 viewers. The show was met with a largely negative critical reaction, and after losing 40% of its viewers in the first week, the show was cancelled. She later commented to Radio Times that on her first show, she was almost too frightened {{to come out of}} her dressing room. Lawson added that having to pretend to <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lives of the celebrities on her show became too much of an effort.|$|E

5|$|William's {{great work}} is a Latin chronicle, written between 1170 and 1184. It {{contains}} twenty-three books; the final book, which deals with the events of 1183 {{and the beginning of}} 1184, has only a prologue and one chapter, so it is either unfinished or the rest of the pages were lost before the whole chronicle began to be copied. The first book begins with the conquest of Syria by Umar in the seventh century, but otherwise the work deals {{with the advent of the}} First Crusade and the subsequent political history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. It is arranged, but was not written, chronologically; the first sections to be written were probably the chapters about the invasion of Egypt in 1167, which are extremely detailed and were likely composed before the Fatimid dynasty was overthrown in 1171. Much of the Historia was finished before William left to attend the Lateran Council, but new additions and corrections were made after his return in 1180, perhaps because he now realized that European readers would also <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of the kingdom. In 1184 he wrote the Prologue and the beginning of the twenty-third book.|$|E

Mullayanagiri, which is the highest peak in Karnataka is located in the district. It is also a tourist's paradise containing hill stations like Kemmanagundi and Kudremukh and waterfalls like Manikyadhara, Hebbe, Kallathigiri.

By February 2011 it was confirmed that SkyTeam members Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines had appointed Goldman Sachs to advise them on a joint potential approach for Virgin Atlantic. Etihad Airways was also reported to be considering a deal, and Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, stated that they would <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> airline, but only for the lucrative take-off and landing slots it holds at Heathrow Airport.|$|E
25|$|Thirdly, covetousness is {{the third}} worldly evil, which {{is also known as}} lust. Colet calls this a plague that has {{overtaken}} many priests and blinded many. Many take part in the Church only for the hope of riches and promotions. Priests forget that they should <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> good they can do more than the amount of riches that they stand to gain. Paul called covetousness the root of all evils. From it, benefices stack up, including pensions and tithes. Colet states that: “every corruption, all the ruin of the Church, all the scandals of the world, come from the covetousness of priests”.|$|E

25|$|One {{continuing}} controversy of {{the player}} selection process is the rule that each team has {{to have at least}} one representative on its league's All-Star roster. Supporters of the rule point out that this prevents the large-market teams from totally dominating the squad, and keeps fan and media interest in the game, as fans would not <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game if their team did not have any players involved. Opponents of the rule contend {{that the purpose of the}} game is to spotlight Major League Baseball's best players, and that some players from stronger teams are left off the roster in favor of possibly less deserving players from weaker teams.|$|E
25|$|Colo-Colo, {{with the}} help of Suazo's tournament-leading 10 goals in 12 games, reached the finals of Copa Sudamericana 2006. On the way to the finals, he netted a hat-trick against Gimnasia LP. Suazo dazzled fans and scouts alike {{throughout}} the tournament, which raised questions about him staying with the team in 2007. Teams such as Santos Laguna of Mexico and Calcio Catania of Italy were both rumored to <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> player. However, Colo-Colo put those rumors to rest when they bought the rest of Suazo's ownership from his former club, Audax, on 15 December 2006, for one million US dollars. Ten percent of that fee ($100,000) went to Suazo's pocket. The move also assured his services to the club until June 2007.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} Steven Wilson {{was going to}} sign to the Delerium label, he owned a lot of {{material}} recorded during the mid- and later '80s that he had recorded subsequently on three demo tapes - Tarquin's Seaweed Farm, Love, Death & Mussolini and The Nostalgia Factory. He sent copies of those tapes to people he felt would <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recordings, asking them to spread the word. Delerium originally intended to release all of that material in a double debut album, but Wilson decided to just pick the songs he considered the best ones. These songs were mastered to make Porcupine Tree's first studio album, On the Sunday of Life... (1991); all of the leftover tracks would be later released on a compilation album called Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape (1994).|$|E

25|$|Where the {{presence}} of burrowing owls conflicts with development interests, a passive relocation technique has been applied successfully: rather than capturing the birds and transporting them to a new site (which may be stressful and prone to failure), the owls are half-coerced, half-enticed to move on their own accord. The preparations need to start several {{months prior to the}} anticipated disturbance with observing the owl colony and noting especially their local movements and site preferences. After choosing a location nearby that has suitable ground and provides good burrowing owl breeding habitat, this new site is enhanced by adding burrows, perches, etc. Once the owls have accustomed to the changes and are found to <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> location – if possible, this should be at the onset of spring, before the breeding season starts – they are prevented from entering the old burrows. A simple one-way trapdoor design has been described that is placed over the burrow for this purpose. If everything has been correctly prepared, the owl colony will move over to the new site {{in the course of a}} few nights at most. It will need to be monitored occasionally for the following months or until the major human construction nearby has ended.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Frost and his explosive, up-tempo offense led the Knights to a 6–7 record. UCF {{began the}} Frost era with a 38-0 shutout win over FCS {{opponent}} South Carolina State. After losing its next two to Big Ten opponents #5 Michigan in a rout and Maryland in double overtime, the Knights defeated FIU and East Carolina. Central Florida then suffered a close 26-25 loss {{due to a}} late field goal to Temple on October 15. The Knights rebounded the following week to defeat UConn by a score of 24-16. UCF suffered a defeat on October 29 to Houston, then responded with wins over Tulane and Cincinnati, gaining bowl eligibility. Frost's squad concluded the regular season with losses to Tulsa and archrival South Florida. The Knights lost to Arkansas State in the 2016 Cure Bowl by a score of 31-13. After the 2016 season, Oregon fired head coach Mark Helfrich, under whom Frost served as offensive coordinator from 2013-2015. Amidst rumors that he might <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ducks opening, Frost announced he {{was not interested in}} Oregon and that he would return as UCF's head coach in 2017. Ironically, the position eventually went to UCF's rival coach, South Florida head coach Willie Taggart.|$|E
