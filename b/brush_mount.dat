50|$|Communication {{between the}} {{ground-based}} signalling {{system and the}} in-cab equipment is made by the crocodile, an electrical contact placed between the rails (in the four foot way) and a metallic <b>brush</b> <b>mounted</b> beneath the locomotive cab. It is distinctively French, originating on the Chemins de Fer du Nord around 1872, spreading throughout France and penetrating into Belgium and Luxembourg after 1900. It was intended principally to provide evidence of the alertness of the driver, not to act to control a train automatically.|$|R
50|$|Motors and {{generators}} {{suffer from}} a phenomenon known as 'armature reaction', one {{of the effects of}} which is to change the position at which the current reversal through the windings should ideally take place as the loading varies. Early machines had the <b>brushes</b> <b>mounted</b> on a ring that was provided with a handle. During operation, it was necessary to adjust the position of the brush ring to adjust the commutation to minimise the sparking at the brushes. This process was known as 'rocking the brushes'.|$|R

40|$|The subject invention, ``A Pipe Cleaning Machine,`` {{known as}} ``Buffy,`` is {{a device that}} strips {{pipeline}} of its coating down to the metal. The apparatus consists {{of a series of}} motor-driven metal <b>brushes</b> <b>mounted</b> on a ring structure that fits the around the pipe`s circumference. Once stripped, the pipeline {{may or may not be}} abrasive-blasted, but is then coated and wrapped, and the trench is back-filled. Present models of the Buffy can be used on pipe up to 36 `` in diameter. One of the device`s unique features is its ability to operate while the pipeline remains in service...|$|R
5000|$|Various [...] "machines" [...] are the {{subjects}} of Horn's work in the 1980s. Among others, she created a machine to mimic the human act of painting in The Little Painting School Performs a Waterfall (1988). Thirteen feet above the floor on a gallery wall, three fan-shaped paint <b>brushes</b> <b>mounted</b> on flexible metal arms slowly flutter down into cups filled with blue and green acrylic paint. After {{a few seconds of}} immersion they snap backward, spattering paint onto the wall, the ceiling, the floor, and onto canvases projected from the wall below. The brushes immediately resume their descent, and the cycle is repeated until each canvas is covered in paint.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of the dimensions of lifting <b>brushes,</b> <b>mounted</b> on the cutting bar of a small combine, on the losses at direct harvesting of standing vine dry edible bean, was studied. The form of the brushes was cylindrical and they were mounted on the cutter-bar along the direction of travel of the machine. The diameter and the longitude of the brushes were studied {{as well as the}} distance between them on the cutter-bar. Losses at cutting were evaluated. The limits of space position of the pods by height of two new cultivars of standing vine dry bean were determined. It was established that application of the brushes could decrease the losses at direct harvesting under 12...|$|R
50|$|The model {{consisted}} {{of a series of}} some 20 drive coils through which a small armature (called the bucket) traveled, pushed by the pulsed magnetic fields of the drive coils. The bucket rode on four rails made from copper plumbing tubes, through which was fed direct current from several car batteries connected in series. It was an epoxy glass cylinder, roughly 10 cm in diameter by 20 cm long, wrapped with a coil of aluminium wire, energized by the batteries. The copper rails were mounted onto the interior of the drive coils, and the bucket was held onto the copper rails by spring-loaded beryllium copper strips with automotive carbon <b>brushes</b> <b>mounted</b> on the ends. The passage of the bucket depressed microswitches which triggered the discharge of capacitors through the drive coils.|$|R

A eight-bar linkage mechanism is proposed to obtain the aim of 1 -dof acutuation. According to the shape of insulators, the dimension design and kinematic analysis of RVG have been carried out. The optimization is performed to locate the joint points of arm segments, on which the <b>brushes</b> are <b>mounted,</b> approximately on the position circles in the whole opening-and-closing process of RVG.

50|$|Tussey Mountain {{is in the}} Ridge and Valley {{province}} of the Appalachian Mountains. <b>Brush</b> Mountain, <b>Mount</b> Nittany and Bald Eagle Mountain ridges, {{are part of the}} same Paleozoic anticline rock formation consisting of older Ordovician Bald Eagle Formation Sandstone and Juniata Formation Shale, and younger Silurian Tuscarora Formation Quartzite. During the Appalachian orogeny, these layers folded up with the underlying and overlying layers into the Nittany Arch. The arch was a Himalayan scale mountain that towered above what is now Nittany Valley, where the oldest rock layers from deep within the eroded mountain are now exposed.|$|R
50|$|When a commutated motor or {{generator}} uses {{more power}} than a single brush is capable of conducting, an assembly of several <b>brush</b> holders is <b>mounted</b> in parallel {{across the surface of}} the very large commutator. This parallel holder distributes current evenly across all the brushes, and permits a careful operator to remove a bad brush and replace it with a new one, even as the machine continues to spin fully powered and under load.|$|R
50|$|Around 1981, a {{prototype}} K5 Blazer {{was used as}} a testbed for a military CUCV vehicle. Between 1983 and 1987, {{what is known as the}} M1009 CUCV was the production militarized version of the civilian K5. The differences are the lack of an air conditioner, an additional leaf spring in the suspension, a hybrid 12/24 V electrical system (described in detail below), blackout headlights, front <b>mounted</b> <b>brush</b> guard, a rifle rack, and special paint jobs. A majority of them are painted olive drab green or in the woodland camouflage pattern, though some vehicles that saw desert use were painted tan. All M1009s, including its derivatives, are powered with the 6.2 L Diesel power plant.|$|R
5000|$|After Thomas Edison pioneered {{electric}} use, {{light bulbs}} were {{developed for the}} streetlights as well. The first city to use electric street lights was Wabash, Indiana. Charles F. Brush of Cleveland, Ohio wanted to publicly test his new invention the [...] "Brush Light" [...] and needed a city to do so. The City Council of Wabash agreed to testing the lights and on March 31, 1880, Wabash became the [...] "First Electrically Lighted City in the World" [...] as a flood of light engulfed the town from four <b>Brush</b> Lights <b>mounted</b> atop the courthouse. One of the original Brush Lights is {{on display at the}} Wabash County Courthouse. By the beginning of the 20th century, the number of fire-based streetlights was dwindling as developers were searching for safer and more effective ways to illuminate their streets. Fluorescent and incandescent lights became popular during the 1930s and 1940s, when automobile travel began to flourish. A street with lights was referred to as a white way during the early 20th century. Part of New York City's Broadway was nicknamed the Great White Way due to the massive number of electric lights used on theater marquees lining the street.|$|R
40|$|Post-test {{investigation}} of a T- 700 engine brush seal found regions void of bristles ('yanked out'), regions of bent-over bristles near the inlet, some 'snapped' bristles near the fence, and a more uniform smeared bristle interface {{between the first and}} last axial rows of bristles. Several bristles and four brush segments were cut from the <b>brush</b> seal, wax <b>mounted,</b> polished, and analyzed. Metallographic analysis of the bristle near the rub tip showed tungsten-rich phases uniformly distributed throughout the bristle, no apparent change within 1 mu m of the interface, and possibly a small amount of titanium, which would represent a transfer from the rotor. Analysis of the bristle wear face showed nonuniform tungsten, which is indicative of material resolidification. The cut end contained oxides and internal fractures; the worn end was covered with oxide scale. Material losses due to wear and elastoplastic deformation within the shear zone and third-body lubrication effects in the contact zone are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{investigation}} is a commutated rotating coil magnetometer element. One detector with quadrature sets of brushes {{could be used to}} align a second element with the total earth's field. It was lay contention that a commutated detector with a suitable filter and contact-modulated d-c amplifier would reduce the noise and stray pick-up considerably over existing design and simplify the application of a servomechanism as well. In order to determine the feasibility of such a device, the design and construction of the commutated detector, filter and contact-modulated amplifier were necessary. The armature consisted of 39 coils of 150 turns each of enameled no. 34 B. & S. copper wire spaced by fiber separators protruding from a luclte core. The Incite cylinder and copper coffiautator were force fit on a brass shaft supported by non-magnetic copper-beryllium ball bearings, Son-magnetic brush rigging and supports were used with the <b>brush</b> rig <b>mounted</b> so it could be rotated and the angular deflection read on a scale. An aluminum pulley was mounted on the shaft to drive the armature by means of a long cord belt and an oscillograph drive motor. Data taken to evaluate the relation between brush axis angle and output voltage of the amplifier. The axis of the armature was placed perpendicular to the horizontal component of the earth’s field and the rotor driven at 1600 RPM. Readings were taken of the amplifier output voltage and angular scale deflection over the Interval from zero output to saturation voltage {{on both sides of the}} zero position. These readings were checked and rechecked over a period of thirty minutes with no difference observed greater than the possible error in scale readings. The results of the data show clearly that the output voltage is linear with the angular change over the small interval near zero output. The magnitude of voltage developed at the 0. 3535 degree limits desired is much greater than the inherent noise and is easily capable of controlling a servo system...|$|R
40|$|Assemblies are {{disclosed}} for cleaning the inside walls of pipes and tubes. A first embodiment includes a small turbine with angled blades axially mounted {{on one end}} of a standoff support. An O-ring for stabilizing the assembly within the pipe is mounted in a groove within the outer ring. A replaceable circular <b>brush</b> is fixedly <b>mounted</b> on {{the opposite end of the}} standoff support and can be used for cleaning tubes and pipes of various diameters, lengths and configurations. The turbine, standoff support, and brush spin in unison relative to a hub bearing that is fixedly attached to a wire upstream of the assembly. The nonrotating wire is for retaining the assembly in tension and enabling return of the assembly to the pipe entrance. The assembly is initially placed in the pipe or tube to be cleaned. A pressurized water or solution source is provided at a required flow-rate to propel the assembly through the pipe or tube. The upstream water pressure propels and spins the turbine, standoff support and brush. The rotating brush combined with the solution cleans the inside of the pipe. The solution flows out of the other end of the pipe with the brush rotation controlled by the flow-rate. A second embodiment is similar to the first embodiment but instead includes a circular shaped brush with ring backing mounted in the groove of the exterior ring of the turbine, and also reduces the size of the standoff support or eliminates the standoff support...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the brush seal {{is considered to be}} most promising among the advanced type seals that are presently in use in the high speed turbomachinery. The <b>brush</b> is usually <b>mounted</b> on the stationary portions of the engine and has direct contact with the rotating element, in the process of limiting the 'unwanted' leakage flows between stages, or various engine cavities. This type of sealing technology is providing high (in comparison with conventional seals) pressure drops due mainly to the high packing density (around 100 bristles/sq mm), and brush compliance with the rotor motions. In the design of modern aerospace turbomachinery leakage flows between the stages must be minimal, thus contributing to the higher efficiency of the engine. Use of the brush seal instead of the labyrinth seal reduces the leakage flow by one order of magnitude. Brush seals also have been found to enhance dynamic performance, cost less, and are lighter than labyrinth seals. Even though industrial brush seals have been successfully developed through extensive experimentation, there is no comprehensive numerical methodology for the design or prediction of their performance. The existing analytical/numerical approaches are based on bulk flow models and do not allow the investigation of the effects of brush morphology (bristle arrangement), or brushes arrangement (number of brushes, spacing between them), on the pressure drops and flow leakage. An increase in the brush seal efficiency is clearly a complex problem that is closely related to the brush geometry and arrangement, and can be solved most likely only by means of a numerically distributed model...|$|R
60|$|AT dawn on the id al-Kurban (10th Zu’l Hijjah, Wednesday, 14th September) a gun {{warned us}} to lose no time; we arose hurriedly, {{and started up}} the Batn Muhassir to Muna. By this means we lost at Muzdalifah the “Salat al-id,” or “Festival Prayers,” the great solemnity of the Moslem year, {{performed}} by all the community at daybreak. My companion was so anxious to reach Meccah, that he would not hear of devotions. About eight A.M. we entered the village, and looked for the boy Mohammed in vain. Old Ali was dreadfully perplexed; a host of high-born Turkish pilgrims were, he said, expecting him; his mule was missing—could never appear—he must be late—should probably never reach Meccah—what would become of him? I began by administering admonition to the mind diseased; but signally failing in a cure, I amused myself with contemplating the world from my Shugduf, leaving the office of directing it to the old Zemzemi. Now he stopped, then he pressed forward; here he thought he saw Mohammed, there he discovered our tent; at one time he would “nakh” the camel to await, in patience, his supreme hour; at another, half mad with nervousness, he would urge the excellent Mas’ud to hopeless inquiries. Finally, by good fortune, we found one of the boy Mohammed’s cousins, who led us to an enclosure [p.203] called Hosh al-Uzam, in the Southern portion of the Muna Basin, at the base of Mount Sabir.[FN#1] There we pitched the tent, refreshed ourselves, and awaited the truant’s return. Old Ali, failing to disturb my equanimity, attempted, as those who consort with philosophers often will do, to quarrel with me. But, finding no material wherewith to build a dispute in such fragments as “Ah!”—“Hem!”—“Wallah!” he hinted desperate intentions against the boy Mohammed. When, however, the youth appeared, with even more jauntiness of mien than usual, Ali bin Ya Sin lost heart, <b>brushed</b> by him, <b>mounted</b> his mule, and, doubtless cursing us “under the tongue,” rode away, frowning viciously, with his heels playing upon the beast’s ribs.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{continuously}} harvest citrus fruit using on-going harvesting machines such as canopy shakers, the catching system should catch and collect fruits continuously. In this thesis, three concepts were explored for a catching system {{appropriate for the}} canopy harvesting system. The first concept is a brush catching concept applied to low profile catching systems. Strip <b>brush</b> brooms were <b>mounted</b> {{at the end of}} collecting beds to make seals around tree trunk and along the narrow space between trees. The strip brush brooms used in this project were originally manufactured for street sweeping vehicles. Each brush could tilt from 30 degrees up to 45 degrees using an electrical linear actuator. The second concept is to adjust catching unit to an irregular tree row using tree position measured by range sensor. Brush catching units are moved laterally using actuators controlled by the programmable logic controller (PLC). As the tree approaches the front of catching system, its distance is measured by range sensor. An output signal from range sensor is filtered and modulated as continuous step signal. Based on this data, brush catching units can move to accommodate tree misalignment within the row. The last concept is a kind of selective catching concept. This concept was not fully completed in this project. It required two procedures to execute; 1) skip catching mode using actuators; and 2) identifying sensing for immature or diseased trees. The first required procedure could be solved by making enough space between brush catching units for the rejected tree to pass through without catching fruits. Actuating times for skipping mode were studied and preset to PLC. Otherwise, the maturity of trees can be determined using a DGPS based tree fruit harvest selection map. A timer-based method was used to order the trees for selective rejection of immature trees in this study. The efficiency of this catching system was measured in terms of collecting rate and skipping rate under the simulated catching environment. Mean percentage in catching tennis balls (substituted for fruits) was reported as 98. 55 %, while the effectiveness for skipping immature fruits was 68 %...|$|R
