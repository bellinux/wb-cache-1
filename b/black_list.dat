In the original script, the story was set at the Scripps National Spelling Bee, but the name was changed to a fictional bee since the filmmakers did not expect Scripps to allow {{the use of their}} name in the film. After two other actors declined to play the main character, Bateman decided to take on the role himself, and cast the other roles by a combination of contacting friends and open casting calls. Filming took place in Los Angeles at the end of 2012.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Hsu {{went to the}} United States as a Columbia University {{exchange}} scholar. In {{the same}} year, he joined the World United Formosans for Independence, and he also served as the literary editor for the Taiwan Tribune.

In 1990, Hsu was invited to a meeting by President Lee Teng-hui and returned to Taiwan as a Taiwanese-American professor. With the influence of then-legislators Chen Shui-bian, Peng Pai-hsien, Hung Chi-chang, and Lu Hsiu-yi, the government relented and removed the restriction for Hsu to exit and enter the country, finally issuing him a new passport.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, danger listing {{has sparked}} {{conservation}} efforts and prompted {{the release of}} funds, resulting in a positive development for sites such as the Galápagos Islands and Yellowstone National Park, {{both of which have}} subsequently been removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger. Despite this, the list itself and UNESCO's implementation of it have been the focus of criticism. In particular, States Parties and other stakeholders of World Heritage Sites have questioned the authority of the Committee to declare a site in danger without their consent. Until 1992, when UNESCO set a precedent by placing several sites on the danger list against their wishes, States Parties would have submitted a programme of corrective measures before a site could be listed. Instead of being used as intended, the List of World Heritage in Danger is perceived by some states as a <b>black</b> <b>list</b> and according to Christina Cameron, Professor at the School of Architecture, Canada Research Chair on Built Heritage, University of Montreal, has been used as political tool {{to get the attention of}} States Parties. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) notes that UNESCO has referenced the List of World Heritage in Danger (without actually listing the site) in a number of cases where the threat could be easily addressed by the State Party. The Union also argues that keeping a site listed as endangered over a long period is questionable and that other mechanisms for conservation should be sought in these cases.|$|E

Winzer's department set up a specified <b>black</b> <b>list</b> of titles to be separated out. However, in the Library No.I, like all over the western sectors this <b>black</b> <b>list</b> circulated by the magistrate was not followed since it was considered as subsuming too many titles of other leaning as National Socialistic or militarist.|$|E

25|$|During the 1939–1945 Emergency {{extensive}} {{postal censorship}} took {{place under the}} control of the Department of Defence whose powers were conferred by the Emergency Powers Act 1939. Civilian mail was controlled by the approximately 200 censors who worked in Dublin's Exchequer Street and who had all been vetted by the G2 Directorate of Intelligence and the Gardaí. Using the <b>Black</b> <b>List</b> and White List to target certain mail, the small staff were unable to effect 100% censorship; however, continental European mail was all reviewed, as was all incoming and outbound airmail. Following the overthrow of France and the Low Countries in May 1940, the British instigated full terminal mail censorship but the Irish were unable to look at more than about 10% due to the enormous staff this would have required. Covert censorship of mail between Northern Ireland and the south was effected by warrants obtained by G2, who also obtained warrants from the Minister for Justice for internal mail oversight.|$|E
25|$|On 17 November 1917 Britons {{captured}} Jaffa {{and most}} male parishioners of Austrian, German or Ottoman nationality from Jaffa and Sarona, including Rabenau, were interned in Wilhelma as enemy nationals.

In August 1918 the internees were relocated to Sidi Bishr and Helwan near Alexandria in Egypt. Rabenau and the internees built up congregational life in their Egyptian exile, lasting three years. With the Treaty of Versailes becoming effective on 10 January 1920 the Egyptian camps were dissolved and Rabenau became the internees' coordinator of the closedown. Most internees returned to the Holy Land, except of those banned by a British <b>black</b> <b>list,</b> such as D. Dr. Friedrich Jeremias, Provost of Jerusalem. Rabenau went to Germany to reunite with his family, the Britons refused his return to Jaffa in July 1920. In April 1921 the Prussian Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council appointed Gustaf Dalman, formerly head of the German Protestant Institute of Archaeology in Jerusalem as Provost at the Evangelical Church of the Redeemer until Albrecht Alt arrived.|$|E
