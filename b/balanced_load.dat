40|$|<b>Load</b> <b>balancing</b> {{middleware}} is {{used extensively}} to improve scalability and overall system throughput in distributed systems. Many <b>load</b> <b>balancing</b> middleware services are simplistic, however, {{since they are}} geared only for specific usecases and environments. These limitations {{make it hard to}} use the same <b>load</b> <b>balancing</b> service for anything other than the distributed application it was designed for originally. This lack of generality forces continuous re-development of application-specific <b>load</b> <b>balancing</b> services. Not only does re-development increase deployment costs of distributed applications, but it also increases the potential of producing nonoptimal <b>load</b> <b>balancing</b> implementations since proven <b>load</b> <b>balancing</b> service optimizations cannot be reused directly.

Selection of the best phase converter for any application depends on the sensitivity of the load to these factors. Three-phase induction motors are very sensitive to voltage imbalances.|$|E

50|$|The USSR {{originally}} selected 3,000 V DC for mainline electrification. Even then in {{the early}} 1930s, it was realised {{that it was too}} low for the catenary but too high for optimal motors. The solution to this problem was to use 25 kV AC for the catenary and provide on-board transformers to step down the 25 kV to a much lower voltage where it was then rectified to give a lower voltage DC. Another proposal was to use 6,000 V DC where the high voltage DC would be reduced by power electronics before being applied to the motors. Only one experimental train set at 6 kV was made and it only operated in the 1970s. In the last years of the Soviet Union a debate was in progress as to whether the 3,000 V DC system should be converted to a 12 kV DC system or to the standard 25 kV system. 12 kV DC was claimed to have the same technical-economic advantages as 25 kV AC while costing less and putting a <b>balanced</b> <b>load</b> on the nation's AC power grid (there is no Reactive power problem to deal with).

Faults on one phase to ground will cause a protection event (fuse or breaker open) locally and not involve other phases or other connected equipment. An example of application is local distribution in Europe (and elsewhere), where each customer may be only fed from one phase and the neutral (which is common to the three phases). When a group of customers sharing the neutral draw unequal phase currents, the common neutral wire carries the currents resulting from these imbalances. Electrical engineers try to design the system so the loads are balanced {{as much as possible}} within premises where 3-phase power is used. [...] These same principles apply to the wide scale distribution of power to individual premises. Hence, every effort is made by supply authorities to distribute all three phases over a large number of premises so that, on average, as nearly as possible a <b>balanced</b> <b>load</b> is seen at the point of supply.For domestic use, some countries such as the UK may supply one phase and neutral at a high current (up to 100A) to one property, while others such as Germany may supply 3 phases and neutral to each customer, but at a lower fuse rating, typically 32 A per phase, and [...] "shuffled" [...] to avoid the effect that more load tends to be put on the first phase.|$|E
