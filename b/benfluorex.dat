50|$|On 18 December 2009, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) {{recommended}} {{the withdrawal of}} all medicines containing <b>benfluorex</b> in the European Union, because their risks, particularly {{the risk of heart}} valve disease (fenfluramine-like cardiovascular side-effects), are greater than their benefits. Thus Frachon et al. showed a significantly higher prevalence of unexplained valvular heart disease in patients taking <b>benfluorex</b> compared to controls. and Weill et al. looked at over 1 million diabetic patients demonstrating a higher hospitalization rate in <b>benfluorex</b> takers for valvular heart disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benfluorex</b> is an {{anorectic}} and hypolipidemic {{agent that}} is structurally related to fenfluramine patented and manufactured by a French pharmaceutical company Servier.

50|$|Fenfluramine, {{a related}} drug, had been {{withdrawn}} from the market in 1997 after reports of heart valve disease, pulmonary hypertension, and development of cardiac fibrosis. This side effect is mediated by the metabolite norfenfluramine on 5HT2B receptors of heart valves (Rothman et al., Circulation 2000), leading to a characteristic pattern of heart failure following proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts on the tricuspid valve. Both fenfluramine and <b>benfluorex</b> form norfenfluramine as a metabolite.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: REGULATE {{trial was}} {{designed}} to compare the efficacy and safety of <b>benfluorex</b> versus pioglitazone in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. METHODS: Double-blind, parallel-group, international, randomised, non-inferiority trial. More {{than half of the}} 196 participating centres were primary care centres. Patients eligible had type 2 DM uncontrolled on sulfonylurea. 846 were randomised. They received study treatment for 1 year. 423 patients were allocated to <b>benfluorex</b> (150 to 450 mg/day) and 423 were allocated to pioglitazone (30 to 45 mg/day). Primary efficacy criterion was HbA(1 c). Safety assessment included blinded echocardiographic evaluation of cardiac and valvular status. RESULTS: At baseline, patients were 59. 1 ± 10. 5 years old with HbA 1 c 8. 3 ± 0. 8 %, and DM duration 7. 1 ± 6. 0 years. During the study, mean HbA 1 c significantly decreased in both groups (benfluorex: from 8. 30 ± 0. 80 to 7. 77 ± 1. 31 versus pioglitazone: from 8. 30 ± 0. 80 to 7. 45 ± 1. 30 %). The last HbA 1 c value was significantly lower with pioglitazone than with <b>benfluorex</b> (p< 0. 001) and non-inferiority of <b>benfluorex</b> was not confirmed (p = 0. 19). Among the 615 patients with assessable paired echocardiography (310 <b>benfluorex,</b> 305 pioglitazone), 314 (51 %) had at least one morphological valvular abnormality and 515 (84 %) at least one functional valvular abnormality at baseline. Emergent morphological abnormalities occurred in 8 patients with <b>benfluorex</b> versus 4 with pioglitazone (OR 1. 99), 95 % CI (0. 59 to 6. 69). Emergent regurgitation (new or increased by one grade or more) occurred more frequently with <b>benfluorex</b> (82 patients, 27 %) than with pioglitazone (33 patients, 11 %) (OR 2. 97), 95 % CI (1. 91 to 4. 63) and were mainly rated grade 1; grade 2 (mild) was detected in 2 patients with <b>benfluorex</b> and 3 with pioglitazone.

We therefore designed an echocardiography-based multicenter study to compare the frequency of left heart valve regurgitations in diabetic patients exposed to <b>benfluorex</b> for at least 3 months and in diabetic control subjects never exposed to the drug. METHODS AND RESULTS: This reader-blinded, controlled study conducted in 10 centers in France between February 2010 and September 2011 prospectively included 376 diabetic subjects previously exposed to <b>benfluorex</b> who were referred by primary care physicians for echocardiography and 376 diabetic control subjects. Through the use of propensity scores, 293 patients and 293 control subjects were matched for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. The main outcome measure was the frequency of mild or greater left heart valve regurgitations. In the matched sample, the frequency and relative risk (odds ratio) of mild or greater left heart valve regurgitations were significantly increased in <b>benfluorex</b> patients compared with control subjects: 31. 0 % versus 12. 9 % (odds ratio, 3. 55; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 03 - 6. 21) for aortic and/or mitral regurgitation, 19. 8 % versus 4. 7 % (odds ratio, 5. 29; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 46 - 11. 4) for aortic regurgitation, and 19. 4 % versus 9. 6 % (odds ratio, 2. 38; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 27 - 4. 45) for mitral regurgitation.

However, no data linking previous drug exposure to the frequency of diagnosis of drug-induced valvular heart disease (DI-VHD) are available. The present {{study was conducted to}} address this issue. METHODS AND RESULTS: This echocardiography reader-blinded, controlled study conducted in 10 centres between February 2010 and February 2012 prospectively included 835 subjects previously exposed to <b>benfluorex</b> referred by primary care physicians for echocardiography. Based on blinded off-line analysis, echocardiography findings were classified as: (i) DI-VHD (+) for patients with an echocardiographic diagnosis of DI-VHD, (ii) inconclusive, and (iii) DI-VHD (-) for patients without signs of DI-VHD. Fifty-seven (6. 8 %) patients exposed to <b>benfluorex</b> were classified as DI-VHD (+), 733 (87. 8 %) patients were classified as DI-VHD (-), and 45 (5. 4 %) were classified as inconclusive. Mitral and aortic DI-VHD were reported in 43 patients (5. 1 %) and 30 (3. 6 %) patients, respectively. Longer duration of exposure, female gender, smoking, and lower BMI were independently associated with a diagnosis of DI-VHD. Good inter-observer reproducibility was observed for the echocardiography classification (Kappa = 0. 83, P < 0. 00001). CONCLUSIONS: About 7 % of patients without a history of heart valve disease previously exposed to <b>benfluorex</b> present echocardiography features of DI-VHD.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundGiven the {{association}} between valvular heart disease and drugs that alter serotonin metabolism, concerns have been raised {{about the possibility of}} an association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use and drug-induced valvular disease. In France, SSRI use has been suggested to be an important confounding factor in the development of heart valve lesions in patients exposed to <b>benfluorex</b> {{in the context of the}} ‘Médiator scandal’. AimsTo address the relationship between SSRI use and valve regurgitation and morphology in a large cohort of patients exposed to <b>benfluorex.</b> MethodsOverall, 832 consecutive patients exposed to <b>benfluorex</b> prospectively referred to 10 centres underwent complete echocardiography examinations according to a standardized protocol. Echocardiograms were independently and blindly read off-line by two experts. ResultsNinety patients had been exposed to SSRIs for 3 months or more. The proportions of patients with no or trivial, mild, moderate or severe mitral regurgitation (MR) or aortic regurgitation (AR) were not different between SSRI patients and non-SSRI patients (P= 0. 63 and 0. 58, respectively). The frequencies of AR≥mild (20 [22. 2 %] vs 145 [19. 5 %]; P= 0. 55) and MR≥mild (14 [15. 6 %] vs 118 [15. 9 %]; P= 0. 93) were similar in SSRI patients and non-SSRI patients. The frequencies of aortic and mitral valve abnormalities suggestive of drug-induced toxicity were also similar in the two patient groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis confirmed the absence of any identifiable relationship between AR or MR and morphological abnormalities and SSRI use in the present cohort.

40|$|International audienceAims The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{criteria}} for diagnosis of drug-induced {{valvular heart disease}} (DIVHD) are only based on the observation of aortic regurgitation ≥ mild and/or mitral regurgitation ≥ moderate. We sought to evaluate the diagnostic value of FDA criteria in a cohort of control patients and in a cohort of patients exposed to a drug (<b>benfluorex)</b> known to induce VHD. Methods and results This prospective, multicentre study included 376 diabetic control patients not exposed to valvulopathic drugs and 1000 subjects previously exposed to <b>benfluorex.</b> Diagnosis of mitral or aortic DIVHD {{was based on a}} combined functional and morphological echocardiographic analysis of cardiac valves. Patients were classified according to the FDA criteria [mitral or aortic-FDA(+) and mitral or aortic-FDA(−) ]. Among the 376 control patients, 2 were wrongly classified as mitral-FDA(+) and 17 as aortic-FDA(+) (0. 53 and 4. 5 % of false positives, respectively). Of those exposed to <b>benfluorex,</b> 48 of 58 with a diagnosis of mitral DIVHD (83 %) were classified as mitral-FDA(−), and 901 of the 910 patients (99 %) without a diagnosis of the mitral DIVHD group were classified as mitral-FDA(−). All 40 patients with a diagnosis of aortic DIVHD were classified as aortic-FDA(+), and 105 of the 910 patients without a diagnosis of aortic DIVHD (12 %) were classified aortic-FDA(+). Older age and lower BMI were independent predictors of disagreement between FDA criteria and the diagnosis of DIVHD in patients exposed to <b>benfluorex</b> (both P ≤ 0. 001). Conclusions FDA criteria solely based on the Doppler detection of cardiac valve regurgitation underestimate for the mitral valve and overestimate for the aortic valve the frequency of DIVHD. Therefore, the diagnosis of DIVHD must be based on a combined echocardiographic and Doppler morphological and functional analysis of cardiac valve...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decades, obesity has been {{identified}} as an important driver of morbidity and mortality in the western countries. As a result, pharmacological approaches have been developed to fight obesity, including amphetamine-like drugs acting through a central appetite-suppressant effect. These compounds knew a significant marketing and sales success as early as the years 1960. Very soon after market access, caution has been raised on a potential risk for the cardiovascular system with the use of aminorex, leading to a first outbreak of "primary pulmonary hypertension" (PPH) in the European countries were it was available. A decade later, convincing epidemiological evidence accumulated supporting that both fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine were definite risk factor for the development of PPH, now called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In addition, these drugs appeared to be responsible for severe mitral and aortic regurgitations similar to carcinoid syndrome leading to surgery or death. Similar to aminorex, the cases of anorectic-drug induced complications abated after market withdrawal. Despite these serious warnings, the story repeated itself recently when a chemically similar compound called <b>benfluorex,</b> licensed to treat resistant diabetes and dyslipidemia, has been suspected to be responsible for almost identical cardiovascular complications. This is explained in a large part by the effect of norfenfluramine, the active metabolite of <b>benfluorex,</b> through it's high affinity for the serotonin receptor 5 -HT 2 B responsible for the fenfluramine-induced valvular heart diseases. Curiously, <b>benfluorex</b> has only been withdrawn from the French market after more than 20 years of access and six years after the first publication of suspected cases. A good decision? Very likely. The {{purpose of this article is}} to review the epidemiological and physiopathological evidence linking fenfluramine-derived drugs to cardiovascular complications, and to discuss the currently available data on <b>benfluorex.</b> To cite this journal: Réanimation 20 (2011). © SRLF et Springer-Verlag France 2011.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{case reports}} suggest that <b>benfluorex,</b> a {{fenfluramine}} derivative {{used in the}} management of overweight diabetic patients and dyslipidemia, is associated with cardiac valve regurgitation. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study. Eligible patients were those admitted in the cardiology or the cardiac surgery units of our hospital between January, 1 (st) 2003 and June 30 (th) 2009, with mitral insufficiency diagnostic codes (ICD- 10 I 340 and I 051). Patients with either a primary cause (degenerative, known rheumatic heart disease, infectious endocarditis, congenital, radiation-induced valvular disease, associated connective and/or vasculitis disease, trauma, tumor) or a secondary (functional) cause were considered as having an "explained" mitral regurgitation. Other patients were considered as having an "unexplained" mitral regurgitation and were included as cases. For each case, two controls were matched for gender and for the closest date of birth, among a list of patients with an "explained" mitral regurgitation. Drug exposures were assessed blindly regarding the case or control status, through contacts with patients, their family and/or their physicians. RESULTS: Out of the 682 eligible patients, 27 cases and 54 matched controls were identified. The use of <b>benfluorex</b> was reported in 22 patients: 19 of the 27 cases, versus 3 of the 54 controls, odds-ratio 17. 1 (3. 5 to 83), adjusted for body mass index, diabetes and dexfenfluramine use. CONCLUSION: The use of <b>benfluorex</b> is associated with unexplained mitral regurgitation...|$|E
40|$|A simple LC/UV {{method for}} the {{simultaneous}} identification and quantification of Fluoxetine, Tiratricol, <b>Benfluorex</b> and Pseudoephedrine in slimming formulation is proposed. The method demonstrated {{effective in the}} analyses of herbal mixtures marketed in Italy as slimming capsules. Sixteen different herbal mixtures, selected among the most frequently compounded in Italian pharmacies, were tested as matrices. HPLC analyses were performed in a gradient mode on a C 18 stationary phase The method was validated for accuracy, precision, linearity and selectivity. The limits of detection (LOD) were 3. 4 μg/mL for Pseudoephedrine, 1. 1 μg/mL for Triac, 0. 9 μg/mL for Fluoxetine, and 0. 8 μg/mL for <b>Benfluorex.</b> Repeatability and intermediate precision, expressed as percent of relative standard deviation, ranged from 3 to 7 and from 7 to 12, respectively. Given these limits, the developed method is proposed for the simple and cost effective screening of herbal products illegally adulterated with these four drugs known to enhance slimming effects...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to use magnetic resonance (MR) molecular imaging to 1) characterize the aortic neovascular development in a rat model of atherosclerosis and 2) monitor the effects of an appetite suppressant on vascular angiogenesis progression. BackgroundThe James C. Russell:LA corpulent rat strain (JCR:LA-cp) is a model of metabolic syndrome characterized by obesity, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and vasculopathy, although plaque neovascularity has not been reported in this strain. MR molecular imaging with ανβ 3 -targeted nanoparticles can serially map angiogenesis in the aortic wall and monitor the progression of atherosclerosis. MethodsSix-week old JCR:LA-cp (+/?; lean, n = 5) and JCR:LA-cp (cp/cp; obese, n = 5) rats received standard chow, and 6 obese rats were fed the appetite suppressant <b>benfluorex</b> over 16 weeks. Body weight and food consumption were recorded at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16. MR molecular imaging with ανβ 3 -targeted paramagnetic nanoparticles was performed at weeks 0, 8, and 16. Fasted plasma triglyceride, cholesterol, and glucose were measured immediately before MR scans. Plasma insulin and leptin levels were assayed at weeks 8 and 16. ResultsBenfluorex reduced food consumption (p 0. 05) was observed in the benfluorex-treated or lean rat groups. MR differences paralleled adventitial microvessel counts, which increased (p 0. 05). Body weight, insulin, and leptin were decreased (p < 0. 05) from the untreated obese animals by <b>benfluorex,</b> but not to the lean control levels (p < 0. 05). ConclusionsNeovascular expansion is a prominent feature of the JCR:LA-cp model. MR imaging with ανβ 3 -targeted nanoparticles provided a noninvasive assessment of angiogenesis in untreated obese rats, which was suppressed by <b>benfluorex...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Benfluorex</b> is a hypolipidaemic {{agent with}} biguanide-like properties. To {{evaluate}} its blood glucose lowering action, a single-blind study protocol was designed. Two groups of seven type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients matched for age (50 +/- 4 vs. 53 +/- 1 years), sex, {{body mass index}} (27. 8 +/- 0. 6 vs. 26. 5 +/- 0. 7 kg/m 2), and duration of diabetes were studied before and after 1 month of treatment with <b>benfluorex</b> 150 mg tid (= tres in die = three times a day), PO (= per os = by mouth) or a placebo, respectively. All patients had previously been treated by diet alone. In all patients, parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism were obtained. Insulin sensitivity was assessed {{by means of a}} euglycaemic (5. 1 +/- 0. 1 mM) hyperinsulinaemic (516 +/- 28 pM) clamp performed in combination with [3 (- 3) H]glucose infusion and indirect calorimetry. In no case was there a significant change in body mass index (27. 6 +/- 0. 5 vs. 26. 4 +/- 0. 7 kg/m 2). After 1 month of treatment, fasting plasma glucose (6. 8 +/- 0. 2 vs. 8. 1 +/- 0. 6 mM) and HbA 1 C (glycated haemoglobin; 6. 5 +/- 0. 2 vs. 8. 0 +/- 0. 7 %) were lower in the <b>benfluorex</b> group than in the placebo-treated patients (both p < 0. 05). No change was observed in hepatic glucose production (HGP) (13. 5 +/- 1. 4 vs. 13. 9 +/- 1. 1 mumol/min per kg), the basal rate of glucose, and lipid oxidation and non-oxidative glucose metabolism, or in plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol concentrations...|$|E

40|$|AimsBenfluorex’s {{imputability}} in drug-induced valvular {{heart disease}} (DIVHD) is now well established. However no data about long term clinical and echocardiographic follow-up of patients suffering from benfluorexrelated DIVHD are available. The present {{study was conducted to}} address this issue. Methods and resultsBetween January 2003 and June 2012, after an exhaustive analysis of our database, 20 patients (55 ± 9 years, 90 % women, body mass index: 32. 9 ± 9 kg/m²) hospitalized for heart failure were retrospectively identified with <b>benfluorex</b> induced moderate or severe mitral regurgitation (MR). Initially 70 % of them presented NYHA class III or IV. MR was quantified as moderate in 11, moderate to severe in 8 and severe in one patient. Aortic regurgitation (AR) was also present in 17 patients (85 %) : mild in 5, moderate in 9 and moderate to severe in 3 patients. During a median follow-up of 7 years, heart failure episodes led to 53388 Valve replacements. Two patients died, one in the surgical group and one in the medical group. Among survivors, NYHA class improved in 6 patients in the surgical group but only in 4 in the medical group. After withdrawal of <b>benfluorex,</b> MR decreased in 7 patients and AR decreased in 5 patients. MR was stable in 3 patients and AR in 4 patients. A worsening of MR was not observed and AR worsened in 2 patients. ConclusionAfter an hospitalization for a first episode of heart failure related to benfluorex-induced MR, patients are exposed to a large number of cardiac events including repeated hospitalizations and death...|$|E
40|$|The active {{pharmaceutical}} ingredient racemic <b>benfluorex</b> hydrochloride (benfluorex–HCl) has {{an interesting}} phase behavior due to an elusive solid–solid phase transition. The stability hierarchy between different phases is often determined based on heat-related experiments only or slurry interconversion. It is shown that if pressure and volume are taken into account, not only the phase equilibria are correctly positioned in the pressure–temperature phase diagram, but the experimental data also improves. Thus, {{it has been found}} that the racemic benfluorex–HCl is enantiotropic under “ordinary conditions” with polymorph II and polymorph I, respectively, being the low- and the high-temperature phases.

40|$|Improving {{the action}} of insulin is a {{relatively}} new concept in diabetes management. Insulin sensitivity can be improved by reduction of excessive body weight, regular physical activity and, possibly, by correcting a subclinical magnesium deficiency. Pharmacological means of improving insulin action include metformin, antiobesity serotoninergic agents and, possibly, <b>benfluorex.</b> New compounds aiming at improving {{the action of}} insulin are in development and include thiazolidinedione derivatives (known as "insulin sensitizers"), inhibitors of adipose tissue lipolysis (e. g. acipimox), and inhibitors of free fatty acid oxidation (e. g. etomoxir). Avoidance of drugs that reduce insulin sensitivity, such as beta blockers and thiazide diuretics, is recommended. Finally, cigarette smoking is associated with resistance to insulin but it remains to be demonstrated that cessation of cigarette smoking does in fact increase sensitivity to insulin.

40|$|Improving {{the action}} of insulin is a {{relatively}} new concept in therapy. It should, however, become more and more important because of the rapid expansion of the insulin resistance syndrome (including upper body adiposity, glu-cose intolerance, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, etc.) in industrialized countries and its dramatic consequences for public health. Insulin sensitiv-ity can be improved by non-pharmacological means, essentially reduction of excessive body weight, promotion of regular physical activity and modification of dietary habits, as well as, possibly, cessation of smoking and correction of subclinical magnesium deficiency. Currently available pharmacological means mainly include the biguanide compound metformin and possibly anti-obesity agents, such as (d-) fenflu-ramine, fluoxetine and <b>benfluorex.</b> New com-pounds aiming at improving {{the action of}} insulin are in development, especially the thiazolidine-dione derivatives (e. g. troglitazone), known as insulin sensitizers'. Treatment of insulin resist-ance may have important gynaecological applications, essentially in polycystic ovary syn-drome and, possibly, after menopause. Hope-fully, improving insulin sensitivity could ameliorate the cardiovascular prognosis of numerous individuals having some or all com-ponents of insulin resistance syndrome.
