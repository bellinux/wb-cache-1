5|$|Owing to {{the timing}} of its dissipation, Emily spared {{neighboring}} Haiti from the devastation initially anticipated. At least 235 people in Jacmel and Tabarre, as well as 65 prisoners from Gonaïves and Miragoâne, required evacuation {{at the height of}} the storm. In Artibonite, civil protection teams evacuated roughly 300 residents. Rainfall triggered floods that damaged over 300 homes throughout the country, while several cholera treatment centers were destroyed. At the risk of new outbreaks, special sterilizers were distributed to sanitize possibly contaminated waters. A body was recovered from a ravine near Les Cayes, but the exact cause of death was disputed; another person in the area sustained injuries after <b>being</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> fallen tree.

5|$|The Sounds {{were one}} game shy {{of winning the}} first-half pennant in 1984. Winning the first-half title is {{something}} that eluded the team during its entire seven-year span in the Southern League. One important highlight {{of the first half}} of 1984 took place on May 4, when Jim Deshaies pitched the club's first no-hitter against the Columbus Astros in the second game of a seven-inning doubleheader. The 5–1 Sounds victory was cut short of being a perfect game following three walks and a batter <b>being</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> pitch, advancing the runner home for the only Astros run of the game. Nashville went on to capture the second-half title, however, for the sixth consecutive season, after defeating the Knoxville Blue Jays in a playoff game. The two teams met again in the divisional playoffs, but the Blue Jays emerged the victor, eliminating the Sounds from the playoffs. Skipper Jim Marshall led his Sounds to a 74–73 record.|$|E

5|$|Yugoslav Ministry of Defence {{announced}} that it had initiated criminal proceedings against an officer, with four other officers facing military disciplinary action. The commander of the Yugoslav Air Force, Colonel General Zvonko Jurjević was suspended. The federal defense minister, General Veljko Kadijević officially apologized for the incident and resigned his post. Šišić was court-martialled in Belgrade in 1992, and acquitted based on claims that he shot at a ZNG helicopter illegally escorting the two ECMM helicopters. In a 2008 interview, Šišić claimed that the ECMM helicopter crashed after <b>being</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> fireball caused by the exploding third helicopter.

5|$|The NWA World Heavyweight Championship was defended in a Raven's Rules match by Raven against Rhino in {{the eighth}} {{encounter}} on the card. A contest conducted under Raven's Rules means there are no count-outs or no disqualifications, and weapons are provided for the environment; {{the only way to}} win is by pinfall or submission. Raven used a pizza cutter early on in the bout to cut open Rhino's forehead, causing him to bleed heavily. Later, Raven's forehead was also cut open due to <b>being</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> trashcan. Rhino used a staple gun during the contest; Rhino placed several staples in Raven's forehead. Cassidy Riley, Jeff Hardy, and Jeff Jarrett interfered in the bout. Riley interfered by accidentally distracting the referee during a pin attempt by Raven, whom Riley was attempting to aid. Jarrett came down to the ring near the end trying to bash Raven in the face with the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt, but was stopped by Hardy. Raven then performed his signature Raven Effect DDT maneuver on Jarrett, forcing his head into the ring mat. Afterwards, Raven performed the Raven Effect DDT on Rhino and covered for the pinfall victory to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at 14 minutes and 28 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Vietnam was {{the country}} with the worst impacts from Koni. Widespread power outages and telecomunnication {{failures}} were commonplace during the storm's passage. Offshore the northern coast of Vietnam, 19fishing and passenger boats capsized due to strong waves produced by the tropical storm. One of these sinkings near Do Son resulted in the death of a fisherman. Another person was killed in Tam Diep after <b>being</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> prostrated tree. Eighteen others in four of Vietnam's northern provinces were injured by flying debris kicked up by Koni's strong winds. In Thanh Hóa Province, strong winds uprooted trees and electricity poles. The roofs of 300homes in Thanh Hóa were torn apart. Koni also disrupted water supplies and telephone service in the city. Further north, in Thái Bình, gusts reaching as high as 90km/h (55mph) damaged 250residences as well as 300ha (740acres) of rice crops. Ten of the eighteen people injured country wide were injured there. In Hanoi, the winds blew trees down. Overall, 3people were killed in Vietnam. Approximately 1,000homes were destroyed by Koni, resulting in significant impacts to agriculture. Despite significant impacts in Vietnam, rains brought by Koni alleviated persistent drought conditions over Vietnam's northern colonies. Though the name Koni was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization, the name was corrected to Goni for its 2009 usage.|$|E
5|$|Across much of Luzon, Irma {{flattened}} {{houses and}} flooding streets, resulting in considerable damage. Irma brought down power lines, {{which led to}} blackouts along the suburbs of Manila. One army officer died via electrocution while trying to fix {{the roof of his}} dwelling in Makati. Many other deaths occurred when they were crushed to death under collapsed houses or killed by flying debris. For instance, two people died when their house on Mindoro Island collapsed and a farmer in Quezon died after <b>being</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> falling coconut. Elsewhere on Midoro Island, 60 homes were destroyed. Offshore, eighteen fisherman were listed as missing. Twenty-six of the casualties happened in Manila while 12others died in the rural town of Daet along the southern part of Luzon due to flooding and falling debris. Due to the storm, iron sheets were littered across the slums of Manila. Communication lines between Daet and Manila were disconnected; many villages between the two location were destroyed. In Lucena, two people were killed and many coconuts were tossed from trees. In Bulacan, civil defense officials advised thousands of inhabitants {{on the banks of the}} Angat River to flee as water along the river threatened to overflow their banks. In the Rizal province, one agency reported that it dispatched several army trucks to fetch roughly 2,000stranded 12- to 15-year-old boy scouts. In a nearby park, the typhoon blew down houses, power poles, billboards and trees. Even though the Clark Air Base and Subic Bay, both United States-run, sustained little damage, six C-130 transports had to be evacuated to the Kadena Air Base in Okinawa and ships, including the aircraft carrier Constellation. Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos ordered the closure of all government offices in affected areas, which included the capital city of Manila. Additionally, many private offices sent their employees home.|$|E
5|$|Four {{games into}} the 2009–10 season, Daniel {{suffered}} {{the first major}} injury of his career, breaking his foot {{in a game against}} the Montreal Canadiens. He suffered the injury after <b>being</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> slapshot from teammate Alexander Edler. Although Daniel finished the game and recorded three assists, x-rays several days later revealed a fracture. He was sidelined for 18 games, returning to the ice on 22 November against the Chicago Blackhawks. Soon after his return, he notched his third career NHL hat-trick in a 4–2 win against the Atlanta Thrashers on 10 December. Four days later, he was named the NHL's Second Star of the Week with seven points {{over the course of the}} week. In the final game of the regular season, on 10 April 2010, against the Calgary Flames, Daniel scored his fourth career NHL hat-trick in a 7–3 win. All three goals were assisted by his brother, helping Henrik pass Alexander Ovechkin for the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL's leading point-scorer. The last goal was chosen by TSN in a fan-voted poll as the NHL's play of the year; Daniel received a between-the-legs tip pass from Henrik near the corner boards before beating goaltender Miika Kiprusoff with a between-the-legs deke. Daniel finished the season with a career-high 56 assists and 85 points despite playing an injury-shortened 63-game campaign. His 1.35 points per game rate was third in the League behind Henrik and Ovechkin. In the subsequent 2010 playoffs, Daniel recorded ten points in the opening round against the Los Angeles Kings, including the series-winning goal in the late stages of Game 6. Against Chicago the following round, his production decreased to four points as the Canucks were eliminated in six games. In the off-season, Daniel was named to the NHL Second All-Star Team. It marked the first time since 1973–74 that two brothers were named post-season NHL All-Stars, as Henrik had been named to the First Team. They were also chosen to appear together on the cover of EA Sports' European version of the NHL 11 video game.|$|E
