50|$|In Britain, the de Havilland Dragon was a {{successful}} aircraft during the 1930s.

40|$|A Blended Wing Body (BWB) {{configuration}} is {{an innovative}} aircraft concept that promises high aerodynamic efficiency compared to conventional aircraft. However, unlike conventional aircraft configurations with circular fuselage cross sections, the major structural design challenge with BWB is the wide non-circular fuselage centre section, {{where it has}} to withstand both internal cabin pressures and wing bending loads. Several solutions have been proposed for the structural design of the BWB centre section, such as Top Surface Panel Plate models, Multi-Bubble model and the Y-Braced <b>Box</b> <b>Fuselage</b> to minimise the weight penalty. However, they contain {{a large number of}} separated compartments which is not particularly suitable for a cargo transport that requires a large and contiguous cargo compartment to carry bulk payload. The aim of this project is to design an efficient structural configuration for an ultra-high capacity military cargo aircraft using a BWB configuration which will be able to carry up to ten M 1 A 2 Abram battle tanks (1, 200, 000 lbs) with a range of 5, 000 NM. The Columned Multi-Bubble (CMB) is analysed and compared with the conventional Multi-Bubble and Flat shell models to verify their structural performance regarding weight and deformation. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) has been used on CAD generated models to achieve an efficient structural configuration.

40|$|Flying-wing {{aircraft}} {{are considered to}} have great advantages and potentials in aerodynamic performance and weight saving. However, they also have many challenges in design. One {{of the biggest challenges}} is the structural design of the inner wing (fuselage). Unlike the conventional fuselage of a tube configuration, the flying-wing aircraft inner wing cross section is limited to a noncircular shape, which is not structurally efficient to resist the internal pressure load. In order to solve this problem, a number of configurations have been proposed by other designers such as Multi Bubble Fuselage (MBF), Vaulted Ribbed Shell (VLRS), Flat Ribbed Shell (FRS), Vaulted Shell Honeycomb Core (VLHC), Flat Sandwich Shell Honeycomb Core (FLHC), Y Braced <b>Box</b> <b>Fuselage</b> and the modified fuselage designed with Y brace replaced by vaulted shell configurations. However all these configurations still inevitably have structural weight penalty compared with optimal tube fuselage layout. This current study intends to focus on finding an optimal configuration with minimum structural weight penalty for a flying-wing concept in a preliminary design stage. A new possible inner wing configuration, in terms of aerodynamic shape and structural layout, was proposed by the author, and it might be referred as ‘Wave-Section Configuration’. The methodologies of how to obtain a structurally efficient curvature of the shape, as well as how to conduct the initial sizing were incorporated. A theoretical analysis of load transmission indicated that the Wave-Section Configuration is feasible, and this was further proved as being practical by FE analysis. Moreover, initial FE analysis and comparison of the Wave-Section Configuration with two other typical configurations, Multi Bubble Fuselage and Conventional Wing, suggested that the Wave-Section Configuration is an optimal design in terms of weight saving. However, due to limitations of the author’s research area, influences on aerodynamic performances have not yet been taken into account...|$|E

5000|$|The LDA-01 was a single-seat tandem-wing monoplane, fabric {{covered with}} metal construction. The {{foreplane}} had a common design to the separately-made {{port and starboard}} wings of the main plane, giving it half the area.

It was powered by a rear-mounted pusher engine. The LDA-01 G-AVOR first flew on 24 August 1971 at Wisley in Surrey, under the power of an 85 hp (63 kW) Continental C85 piston engine, but was later refitted with a more powerful Lycoming O-320 engine.|$|R

5000|$|The E.I was {{essentially}} an armed {{version of the}} Fokker M.5K single-seat reconnaissance aircraft(military designation A.III), which was in turn very closely based {{on the design of}} the 1913 French Morane-Saulnier Type H. Like the Morane, the Fokker was an externally braced mid-winged monoplane with a vertically tapered <b>box</b> section <b>fuselage,</b> with fully movable horizontal and vertical stabilizing surfaces, also known as [...] "flying" [...] surfaces, giving the pilot the usual tail control functions; roll control was achieved through controlled wing warping, as was conventional in contemporary monoplanes. Wing warping was achieved through external cables attached to the wing's rear spar, and running through a king post located {{in the front of the}} cockpit. The fuselage structure was fabric covered welded chromium-molybdenum steel tubing, the biggest difference between the Fokker and the Morane, which had an entirely wooden framework.

5000|$|Development of the company's first design, the W.A.R. Focke-Wulf 190, {{commenced}} in 1973, {{with the}} first flight following in 1974. The aircraft are all half-scale World War II fighter aircraft replicas, based on a common design, consisting of a wooden <b>fuselage</b> <b>box</b> shape and wooden spar wing. Polyurethane foam was then used to create the different aircraft shapes and details. The foam was then covered in a high-strength laminating fabric and epoxy-resin. The series all share a common conventional landing gear design that is electrically retractable. The aircraft were initially powered by 1600 cc Volkswagen air cooled engines of [...] using Lloyd Patner's gear reduction units driving 3-blade Fahlin props, but later Continental O-200 and Lycoming O-235s were used along with the Rotec R2800 radial engine.|$|R
50|$|The DH.29 Doncaster {{was ordered}} by the British Air Ministry as an {{experimental}} long-range monoplane.

The crew of two were in an open cockpit ahead of the wing. Two aircraft were built between 1920 and 1921 at Stag Lane Aerodrome. Early testing of the first aircraft (Serial J6849) resulted in a redesign of the engine installation. The second aircraft (Registered G-EAYO) was built as a ten-seat commercial aircraft.

A proposed military reconnaissance version, the DH.30, was never built.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} problems, which solved during the design of {{transport}} category aircraft, is problem of analysis of the stress distribution in the strengthened fuselage frames structure. Existing integral methods of stress analysis {{does not allow for}} the mutual influence of the deformation {{of a large number of}} elements. The most effective method of solving the problem of analysis of deformations influence on the stress distribution of structure is finite element method, which is a universal method for analyzing stress distribution arbitrary constructions. This article describes the features of the finite element model synthesis of the strengthened fuselage frames structure of the aircraft fuselage transport category. It is shown that the finite element model of strengthened frames can be synthesized by attaching additional finite element models of the reinforcing elements to the base finite element model which is built by algorithm which is developed for normal frame. For each reinforcing element developed a separate class of finite element model synthesis algorithm. The method of synthesis of finite element model of strengthened frame, which are described in this article, developed for object-oriented information technology implemented in an object-oriented data management system "SPACE". Finite-element models of the reinforcing elements are included in the finite element model of the <b>fuselage</b> <b>box</b> after the formation of a regular finite element model of the <b>fuselage</b> <b>box.</b> As the source data for the synthesis of finite element models of the reinforcing elements used the coordinates of the boundary sections nodes of existing finite element models of conventional frames. Reinforcing elements belong to the group of irregular structural elements that connect regular elements of the cross set with different elements that are not intended for the perception and transmission of loads. The only exceptions are the vertical amplification increasing the stiffness of frames in a direction parallel to the axis OY. Source data input for the synthesis of finite element models of the reinforcing elements can occur only through the individual user interfaces that supported by objects of the corresponding classes. Structure of user interfaces depends on the number and type of additional data that required for the synthesis of finite element models of the reinforcing elements. For example, for the synthesis of structures of finite element models of horizontal beams that support the floor of cargo cabin, you must specify the distance between the upper surface of the beam and the horizontal axis of the fuselage, as well as the height of the beam section. For the synthesis of the structure of the finite element model of vertical reinforcing element is enough to specify the distance between the its inner belt and the a vertical axis of symmetry of the fuselage. And in both cases you must to specify a reference to the basic finite element model, by selecting from a list of frame designations. List of frames, as well as links to objects containing the appropriate finite-element models, must be transmitted from an object which references to the level of decomposition, in which the general model of the <b>fuselage</b> <b>box</b> is created. Finite-element models of the reinforcing elements include two groups of nodes. The first group is taken from an array of nodes, which is transmitted from the base finite element model. The second group is formed by the synthesis algorithm of finite element model of the selected class reinforcing element. Therefore, the synthesis of finite element models of the reinforcing elements starts with the formation of their local model versions. On the basis of these models are formed temporary copies, which are transmitted to the general finite element model of the box. This should be considered when developing of data conversion algorithm of data copying from a local finite element model to the temporary copy. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that this method improves the quality of the design of the aircraft fuselage, increasing the amount of structure variant number and reduce the likelihood of errors. ??????????? ????? ??????? ????????? ?????????????????? ?????? ?????????? ?????????, ????? ????????????? ????????? ??????? ?????????????????? ??????? ??????????? ?????????. ?????? ??????????? ????????? ?????????????? ? ??????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ?????? ????? ???????? ????? ?????? ??????? ????????...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{analysis}} {{and design of}} efficient pressurized fuselage configurations for the advanced Blended-Wing-Body (BWB) flight vehicle is a challenging problem. Unlike a conventional cylindrical pressurized fuselage, stress level in a <b>box</b> type BWB <b>fuselage</b> is {{an order of magnitude}} higher, because internal pressure primarily results in bending stress instead of skin-membrane stress. In addition, resulting deformation of aerodynamic surface could significantly affect performance advantages provided by lifting body. The pressurized composite conformal multi-lobe tanks of X- 33 type space vehicle also suffered from similar problem. In the earlier BWB design studies, Vaulted Ribbed Shell (VLRS), Flat Ribbed Shell (FRS); Vaulted shell Honeycomb Core (VLHC) and Flat sandwich shell Honeycomb Core (FLHC) concepts were studied. The flat and vaulted ribbed shell concepts were found most efficient. In a recent study, a set of composite sandwich panel and cross-ribbed panel were analyzed. Optimal values of rib and skin thickness, rib spacing, and panel depth were obtained for minimal weight under stress and buckling constraints. In addition, a set of efficient multi-bubble fuselage (MBF) configuration concept was developed. The special geometric configuration of this concept allows for balancing internal cabin pressure load efficiently, through membrane stress in inner-stiffened shell and inter-cabin walls, while the outer-ribbed shell prevents buckling due to external resultant compressive loads. The initial results from these approximate finite element analyses indicate progressively lower maximum stresses and deflections compared to the earlier study. However, a relative comparison of the FEM weight per unit floor area of the segment unit indicates that the unit weights are still relatively higher that the conventional B 777 type cylindrical or A 380 type elliptic fuselage design. Due to the manufacturing concern associated with multi-bubble fuselage, a Y braced box-type fuselage alternative with special resin-film injected (RFI) stitched carbon composite with foam-core was designed by Boeing under a NASA research contract for the 480 passenger version. It is shown that this configuration can be improved to a modified multi-bubble fuselage which has better stress distribution, for same material and dimension...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 A {{composite}} {{wing panel}} software package, named WING Joint OpTimization and Analysis (WINGJOTA) featuring bolted joint analysis, is created and {{presented in this}} research. Three areas of focus were {{the development of an}} analytic composite bolted joint analysis suitable for fast evaluation; a more realistic wing design than what has been considered in the open literature; and the application of two optimization algorithms for composite wing design. Optimization results from 14 wing load cases applied to a composite wing panel with joints are presented. The composite bolted joint analysis consists of an elasticity solution that provides the stress state at a characteristic distance away from the bolt holes. The stresses at the characteristic distance are compared to a failure criterion on a ply-by-ply basis that not only determines first ply failure but also the failure mode. The loads in the multi-fastener joints used in this study were determined by an iterative scheme that provides the bearing-bypass loads to the elasticity analysis. A preliminary design of a composite subsonic transport wing was developed, based around a mid-size, twin-aisle aircraft. The benchmark design includes the leading and trailing edge structures and the center <b>box</b> inside the <b>fuselage.</b> Wing masses were included as point loads, and fuel loads were incorporated as distributed loads. The side-of-body boundary condition was modeled using high stiffness springs, and the aerodynamic loads were applied using an approximate point load scheme. The entire wing structure was modeled using the finite element code ANSYS to provide the internal loads needed as boundary conditions for the wing panel analyzed by WINGJOTA. The software package WINGJOTA combines the composite bolted joint analysis, a composite plate finite element analysis, a wing aeroelastic cycle, and two optimization algorithms to form the basis of a computer code for analysis and optimization. Both the Improving Hit-and-Run (IHR) and the Multi-Particle Simulated Annealing (MPSA) algorithms were coded and used as the optimization routines in WINGJOTA. It was found that MPSA was able to find panel designs with lighter weights than IHR; however, the computation time was longer...|$|R
