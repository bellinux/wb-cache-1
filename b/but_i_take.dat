500|$|In the 1968 NBA Playoffs, the Lakers {{beat the}} Chicago Bulls and the Warriors {{to set up}} yet another Lakers-Celtics NBA Finals; it was {{considered}} a match of size versus speed, as the Lakers had nobody to counter Celtics coach/center Bill Russell or forward John Havlicek close to the basket, but the Celtics in return had difficulties guarding prolific L.A. outside shooters Baylor, West and fellow guard Gail Goodrich. In Game 1, West only hit seven of 24 shots, and the Lakers lost 107–101, but L.A. evened out the series at two games each. But West, who had scored 38points in a Game 4 win, had sprained his ankle and did not play at full strength {{the rest of the}} series. In Game 5, an injured West scored 35points, but Boston won by threepoints. In Game 6, Havlicek shredded the Lakers with 40points, and after yet another Finals loss to Boston, West commented that the Lakers lost two games they should have won: [...] "We gave them the first game, and we gave them the fifth. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> nothing from them… They're all that way on the Celtics, and you can't teach it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michio Kaku {{explains}} in the appendix of his book, The Future of the Mind, that the Sliders series began [...] "when {{a young boy}} read a book. That book is actually my book Hyperspace, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> no responsibility for the physics behind that series." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hitchens {{has said}} of his reputation: [...] "I {{know a lot of}} people {{consider}} me to be disreputable or foaming at the mouth, but you have to learn not to care, or at least not to mind. I don't like being called 'bonkers' and I think to some extent it demeans people who use phrases like that. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> comfort from the fact that most totalitarian regimes tend to classify their opponents as mentally disordered." ...|$|E
60|$|My own {{feeling about}} Mr. Krebs {{had become more}} complicated; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> my cue from Tom, who dealt with {{situations}} simply.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's true!" [...] he said. [...] "After I {{stole the}} horse to get away, I found that woman running wild down the road, cryin' and sobbin'. At first I thought she'd done the shooting. It was a risky {{thing for me to}} do, gentlemen; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> her up on the horse and got her away to Lowville. It was that much dead weight agin my chances, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> it. She was a woman and--I ain't a dog!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I rather {{think they}} are; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> very little notice of their appearance, as the colonel {{was really in}} evident pain." ...|$|R
2500|$|The show's {{most famous}} remark {{supposedly}} occurred as Groucho was interviewing Charlotte Story, who had borne 20 children. When Marx {{asked why she}} had chosen to raise such a large family, Mrs. Story {{is said to have}} replied, [...] "I love my husband"; to which Marx responded, [...] "I love my cigar, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> it out of my mouth once in awhile." [...] The remark was judged too risqué to be aired, according to the anecdote, and was edited out before broadcast. [...] Charlotte Story and her husband Marion, indeed parents of 20 children, were real people who appeared on the program in 1950. Audio recordings of the interview exist, and a reference to cigars is made ("With each new kid, do you go around passing out cigars?"), but {{there is no evidence of}} the famous line. Marx and Fenneman both denied that the incident took place. [...] "I get credit all the time for things I never said," [...] Marx told Roger Ebert, in 1972. [...] "You know that line in You Bet Your Life? The guy says he has seventeen kids and I say, 'I smoke a cigar, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> it out of my mouth occasionally'? [...] I never said that." [...] Marx's 1976 memoir recounts the episode as fact, but co-writer Hector Arce relied mostly on sources other than Groucho himself—who was by then in his mid eighties, in ill health [...] and [...] mentally compromised—and was probably unaware that Groucho had specifically denied making the legendary observation.|$|E
2500|$|Paul was {{questioned}} on Meet the Press by Tim Russert for asking that US$400 million in previously earmarked funds be directed {{back to his}} district for water projects, a nursing program, to expand a hospital cancer center and US$10 million to promote Texas shrimp. On Meet the Press, Paul defended his bid for the earmarked funds saying he never voted for an earmark in his life. Russert said Paul's statement was like saying, [...] "you voted for it before you voted against it." [...] Congressman Paul responded,"I put them in because I represent people who are asking for some of their money back, ... I'm against the tax system, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> all my tax credits. I {{want to get their}} money back for the people." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{impossible}} for me to make any answer to this woman, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> off my hat and bowed. The sail filled, and we glided away.|$|R

6000|$|Mrs. Fountain: [...] "I can't {{remember}} {{using the}} word hyena, exactly, though I do think the way you talk about Christmas is dreadful. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> back the laughing hyena." ...|$|E
60|$|She did not {{recognize}} me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> {{a good look at}} her as I went by, longing to know what the particular secret was that ended in such a gale of laughter.|$|R
60|$|I {{had to fly}} low to get {{sufficient}} air to breathe, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> {{a straight}} course across an old sea bottom and so had to rise {{only a few feet}} above the ground.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} {{describes}} it. You see, they were three to one; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> {{part of the}} office fittings along with me. I must own that I lost my temper and insulted them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stories of {{moonlight}} nights and things walking about. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> no stock in 'em. I keeps in bed. If {{you listen to}} stories--Lord! You'll get afraid of yourself in a field at midday." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> {{leave to}} dissent from these great men, and {{think they are}} in a double mistake; first, in stating the question, and then in making such an answer, {{provided}} the question had been stated right.|$|E
6000|$|... “To {{be exact}} {{you told me}} that it weighed just under two pounds, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> into account the fact that {{abnormal}} vegetables and freshwater fish have an after-life, in which growth is not arrested.” ...|$|R
60|$|I kind of dodged, and the boot-jack {{broke the}} looking-glass. I could have {{waited to see}} what became of the other {{missiles}} if I had wanted to, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> no interest in such things.|$|R
6000|$|... "So, as I say, Henry had $360, and I had $288. The idea of {{introducing}} the phonograph to South America was Henry's; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> to it freely, being fond of machinery of all kinds.|$|R
