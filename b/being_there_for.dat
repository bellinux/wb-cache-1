In September 1956, he took a trip to London to meet a friend but after <b>being</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> only one day, was robbed of his passport, birth certificate, chequebook, wristwatch, and all the money he had on him.

Back in Liverpool, he confessed his homosexuality to a psychiatrist—a friend of the Epstein family—who suggested to Harry Epstein that his son should leave Liverpool as soon as possible. During the sessions, Epstein revealed his ambition of becoming an actor, so his parents allowed him go to London to study.|$|E

[...] There are many examples of Osborn's pronounced superiority complex, to the point that he will rarely, if ever, admit that he has made mistakes. He often transfers blame for his shortcomings to others or claims that he was better than he was; even before his accident, he spent more time providing Harry with gifts or outings rather than actually <b>being</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> his son or trying to listen to his problems, and nevertheless claims that he was still a good father, likely due to the abusive nature of his own father.|$|E
