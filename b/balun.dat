40|$|Multisection vialess <b>baluns</b> are {{proposed}} by cascading several λ/ 4 edge-coupled lines. Without needing any via-hole or ground connection, these vialess <b>baluns</b> are simply implemented on microstrip structures. With the backside aperture, the even-mode impedance of coupled microstrip lines is raised beyond 280 Ω. Taking advantage of multlsection coupled line approach, the eventual even-mode impedance can achieve {{as small as}} 2 Ω, thus satisfactorily meeting the requirements of λ/ 4 coupled line <b>baluns</b> with open-circuited terminals. Three- and five-section vialess <b>baluns</b> are designed and the predicted performances are validated by experiment.

25|$|One {{easy way}} to make a <b>balun</b> is to use a length of coaxial cable equal to half a wavelength. The inner core of the cable is linked at each end to one of the {{balanced}} connections for a feeder or dipole. One of these terminals should be connected to the inner core of the coaxial feeder. All three braids should be connected together. This then forms a 4:1 <b>balun,</b> which works correctly at only a narrow band of frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Several {{types of}} <b>balun</b> are {{commonly}} used to feed a dipole antenna: current baluns and coax baluns. Baluns can be made using ferrite toroid cores or even from the coax feedline itself. The choice of the toroid core is crucial. A rule of thumb is: the more power, the bigger the core.|$|E

Many cameras include a UTP output with screw terminals; UTP cable bandwidth has improved {{to match the}} baseband of television signals.

25|$|When a dipole with an {{unbalanced}} feedline such as {{coaxial cable}} {{is used for}} transmitting, the shield side of the cable, {{in addition to the}} antenna, radiates. This can induce radio frequency (RF) currents into other electronic equipment near the radiating feedline, causing RF interference. Furthermore, the antenna is not as efficient as it could be because it is radiating closer to the ground and its radiation pattern may be asymmetrically distorted. To prevent this, dipoles fed by coaxial cables have a <b>balun</b> between the cable and the antenna, to convert the unbalanced signal provided by the coax to a balanced symmetrical signal for the antenna.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{narrow-band}} {{design is}} to use a λ/4 length of metal pipe. The coaxial cable is placed inside the pipe; at one end the braid is wired to the pipe while at the other end no connection is made to the pipe. The balanced end of this <b>balun</b> is at the end where no connection is made to the pipe. The λ/4 conductor acts as a transformer, converting the zero impedance at the short to the braid into an infinite impedance at the open end. [...] This infinite impedance at the open end of the pipe prevents current flowing into the outer coax formed by the outside of the inner coax shield and the pipe, forcing the current to remain in the inside coax. This <b>balun</b> design is impractical for low frequencies because of the long length of pipe that will be needed.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{types of}} coaxial cable have a {{characteristic}} impedance of 75Ω, which would therefore {{be a good}} match for a half-wave dipole, however, without special precautions, coax transmission line easily becomes unbalanced (with one conductor at ground potential) whereas a dipole antenna presents a balanced input (both terminals have an equal but opposite voltage with respect to ground). When an antenna is unbalanced, the unbalanced currents or “common mode” currents will flow backward along the outer conductor and the coax line will radiate, {{in addition to the}} antenna itself,. An important consequence is distortion of the antenna’s designed radiation pattern, and change in the impedance seen by the line. The dipole can be properly fed, and retain its expected characteristics, by using a [...] <b>balun</b> in between the coaxial feedline and the antenna terminals. Connection of coax to a dipole antenna using a <b>balun</b> is described in greater detail below.|$|E
40|$|Abstract While larger {{transistors}} {{are used}} to deliver more power in RF transmitter power amplifiers, {{it has been observed}} that the performance per unit gate width decreases with increasing width. In this work, a major cause of this performance degradation in RF LDMOSFET power amplifiers is identified as the mutual inductance in the system, and a field solver and circuit simulator {{are used to}} quantify the mutual inductance. Circuit simulations show that the characteristics of devices with larger widths may be mimicked by models of smaller devices with increasingly larger inductances added to the terminals. In order to prevent the performance degradation caused by the mutual inductance, the use of <b>baluns</b> is proposed to apply phase-inverted signals to adjacent cells within the power amplifier device. Simulations comparing systems with and without <b>baluns</b> show that using <b>baluns</b> allows recovery of performance that is otherwise lost due to source degeneration caused by mutual inductance, as seen by the 7. 8 W output power with <b>baluns</b> as compared to 5. 2 W without for a W= 64 mm device at 900 MHz. 1...|$|R

2500|$|Horizontal wire dipole antennas {{are popular}} {{for use on}} the HF shortwave bands, both for {{transmitting}} and shortwave listening. [...] They are usually constructed of two lengths of wire joined by a strain insulator in the center, which is the feedpoint. The ends can be attached to existing buildings, structures, or trees, taking advantage of their heights. If used for transmitting, {{it is essential that}} the ends of the antenna be attached to supports through strain insulators with a sufficiently high flashover voltage, since the antenna's high voltage antinodes occur there.

40|$|The {{development}} of single-chip transmitters and receivers is hindered by several obstacles. The main difficulties include the low quality factor of MMIC filters, limited output power of solid state devices at millimeter-wave frequencies, and poor frequency stability of monolithic oscillators. This research investigates novel techniques {{to overcome these}} challenges. The scope of work includes proposal of new circuit structures and techniques, theoretical analyses, MMIC realisations and experimental verifications with measured results. To reduce filtering requirements, single-ended and single-balanced resistive mixers, utilising a unique resonance technique to achieve port isolations, are developed for V-band direct conversion receivers. A double-balanced resistive mixer, with high input power capability to reduce output power amplification requirements is also developed for millimeter-wave transmitters. A distributed resistive mixer is proposed to achieve wideband performance with low intermodulation. As {{an alternative to the}} use of <b>baluns</b> for generating anti-phase signals required in balanced mixers, a balanced oscillator is introduced. This novel oscillator can also operate as a power combining oscillator to obtain higher output power. In addition, a transmission-line stabilising technique can be applied to improve the oscillator phase noise. For the analysis of mixer circuits, the large-signal / small-signal analysis technique is extended to the case of multiple device mixers. For <b>baluns</b> used in the balanced mixers, a simplified analysis is applied, leading to a new class of impedance transforming <b>baluns,</b> which can be matched at all ports. The MMIC mixers, oscillator and <b>baluns</b> are realised using Marconi Caswell Ltd. foundry process. The performances of the fabricated MMICs are verified using on-wafer measurements. Theoretical analyses of the multiple device mixers and <b>baluns</b> are in good agreement with experimental results. The oscillator power combining and frequency stabilising techniques are also demonstrated experimentally...|$|R
