25|$|On 12 February, the Hindu {{passengers}} in the Akhaura - Bhairab Bazar rail route between Comilla and Mymensingh were massacred. Taya Zinkin the reporter of the London Economist and the Manchester Guardian {{reported that the}} Mymensingh bound trains from Ashuganj were stopped on the Bhairab Bridge on the Meghna. The Muslim mobs attacked the Hindu passengers {{from both sides of}} the bridge. Those who dived into the river and tried to swim ashore were hit by <b>brickbats</b> and forcefully drowned. According to eyewitness Pierre Dillani about 2,000 Hindus were massacred on the Bhairab Bridge. On the same day, the Hindu passengers on board were attacked near Sararchar, a railway station between Bhairab Bazar and Kishoreganj.|$|E
25|$|Sir Hugh Rose, on {{arriving}} at Poonch, sent Major Gall to the fort at Lohari. The fort and village of Lohari were situated in an extensive level plain. The fort itself was square and flanked by round towers at the corners. It had a ditch {{and a second}} line of works outside the ditch. A company of the 3rd Europeans crossed the open space between the village and fort without opposition and established themselves in a guard-house close to the ditch. The garrison of the fort paid no heed to the summons of surrender. Major Gall concluded that no option remained, after reconnaissance, but to open the third gate {{with a bag of}} gunpowder and carry the fort by storm. Twenty-five files of the 3rd Europeans, under Lieutenants Armstrong and Donne and Ensign Newport occupied the gateways as the storming party. Lieutenant Bonus, Bombay Engineers, under the cover of sharp fire from the 3rd Europeans, placed the powder-bag in front of the closed gate, and the firing party withdrew. The explosion occurred and the storming 3rd Europeans rushed in through the smoke and almost immediately met the enemy face to face. The stormers were assailed by a shower of stones and <b>brickbats</b> as well as by men who cut, stabbed and shot at them from the walls. Lieutenant Donne and Ensign Newport were severely wounded while fighting hand-to-hand, but beat off their assailants and retreated under bayonet protection. Lieutenant Rose now came opportunely to the front for a final charge and the 3rd Europeans, with some of the 25th Bombay Native Infantry, drove their foe before them and a bloody melee ensued. A last stand by the foe near the gateway was also crushed. The bugler private, Private Whirlpool, who made it through the gate first in the final charge, later received the Victoria Cross for his gallantry. The 3rd Bombay Europeans had a toll of 1 killed in action and 17 wounded.|$|E
500|$|The route {{towards the}} hustings between the special constables was narrow, {{and as the}} inexperienced horses were thrust further and further into the crowd they reared and plunged as people {{tried to get out}} of their way. The arrest warrant had been given to the Deputy Constable, Joseph Nadin, who {{followed}} behind the yeomanry. As the cavalry pushed towards the speakers' stand they became stuck in the crowd, and in panic started to hack about them with their sabres. On his arrival at the stand Nadin arrested Hunt, Johnson and a number of others including John Tyas, the reporter from The Times. Their mission to execute the arrest warrant having been achieved, the yeomanry set about destroying the banners and flags on the stand. According to Tyas, the yeomanry then attempted to reach flags in the crowd [...] "cutting most indiscriminately to the right and to the left to get at them" [...] – only then (said Tyas) were <b>brickbats</b> thrown at the military: [...] "From this point the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry lost all command of temper".|$|E

2500|$|Yet this {{occurred}} {{during a time}} in which he was [...] "banned, censored, mentioned in several houses of parliament and threatened with arrest", after which he quipped that it was [...] "the highlight of his life". [...] In particular, [...] "Be Prepared" [...] drew advance <b>brickbats</b> in Brisbane from the chief of police, which he sang anyway, prompting wrath in Adelaide where he signed a petition that he wouldn't sing five songs in that territory.

2500|$|Outrages {{upon the}} former {{slaves in the}} South there were in plenty. Their sufferings were many. But white men, too, were victims of lawless violence, and in all {{portions}} of the North and the late [...] "rebel" [...] states. Not a political campaign passed without the exchange of bullets, the breaking of skulls with sticks and stones, the firing of rival club-houses. Republican clubs marched the streets of Philadelphia, amid revolver shots and <b>brickbats,</b> to save the negroes from the [...] "rebel" [...] savages in Alabama... The project to make voters out of black men {{was not so much}} for their social elevation as for the further punishment of the Southern white people—for the capture of offices for Radical scamps and the entrenchment of the Radical party in power {{for a long time to}} come in the South and in the country at large.|$|E
60|$|But {{worst of}} all was, that time I {{unexpectedly}} returned at early morning from {{a visit to the}} city, and upon approaching the house, narrowly escaped three <b>brickbats</b> which fell, from high aloft, at my feet. Glancing up, what was my horror to see three savages, in blue jean overalls in the very act of commencing the long-threatened attack. Aye, indeed, thinking of those three <b>brickbats,</b> I and my chimney have had narrow escapes.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Go on! In {{the name}} of the Sirkar, go forward!' shouted the Policeman; but there was an ugly {{cracking}} and splintering of shutters, and the crowd halted, with oaths and growlings, before the house whence the <b>brickbat</b> had been thrown.|$|R

60|$|Baffled, but not defeated, Tottie waited till {{some one}} should pass who {{could put the}} letter in for her, but in that retired angle no one passed. Suddenly her sharp eyes espied a <b>brickbat.</b> She set it up on end beside the pump, mounted it, stood on tip-toe, and, {{stretching}} her little body to the very uttermost, tipped the letter safely in. The <b>brickbat</b> tipped over {{at the same instant}} and sent her headlong to the ground. But this was no novelty to Tottie. Regardless of the fall, she gathered herself up, and, with the light heart of one who has gained a victory in the performance of duty, ran off to her miserable home in the back slums.|$|R

6000|$|... "I do like them, and I {{shall be}} one if I can, for {{in spite of}} the {{laughing}} the world would never get on without them.

I should rather enjoy the <b>brickbats</b> and hooting, I think." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{noise in}} the old town was terrific; Great Tom was booming sullenly over the uproar; the bell of Saint Mary's was clanging with alarm; St. Giles's tocsin chimed furiously; howls, curses, flights of <b>brickbats,</b> stones {{shivering}} windows, groans of wounded men, cries of frightened females, cheers of either contending party as it charged the enemy from Carfax to Trumpington Street, proclaimed that the battle was at its height.|$|E
60|$|In {{the evening}} the mob became more violent, {{and in the}} midst of dinner a summons came for Griff's host to attend the Mayor in endeavouring to {{disperse}} it.

60|$|Then <b>Brickbat</b> and Miss Fidget were sold, both at good prices; for {{the horse}} {{had won the}} last race at Tuam, and that put {{him up in the}} market, in spite of Bob's vile {{comparison}} between him and his owner's bullocks; and the mare was a favourite among the Roscommon gentry, who knew little Larry could ride when he meant it.|$|R
