5|$|Philosophy {{of science}} is a {{sub-field}} of philosophy concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of science. The central questions of this study concern what qualifies as science, the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with metaphysics, ontology, and epistemology, for example, when it explores the relationship <b>between</b> <b>science</b> and truth.|$|E
5|$|As a {{description}} of the origin of the universe, the Big Bang has significant bearing on religion and philosophy.

Some believe the Big Bang implies a creator, and some see its mention in their holy books, while others argue that Big Bang cosmology makes the notion of a creator superfluous.|$|E

These topics, {{with the exception}} of math, are thematically linked each year. One of the multiple choice events, alternating <b>between</b> <b>science</b> or social science, is chosen for the Super Quiz. In addition to the seven objective events, there are three subjective events graded by judges: essay, interview and speech.|$|E
5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference <b>between</b> <b>science</b> and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E
5|$|John Harmen Marburger III (February 8, 1941 – July 28, 2011) was an American {{physicist}} {{who directed}} the Office of Science and Technology Policy {{in the administration of}} President George W. Bush, serving as the Science Advisor to the President. His tenure was marked by controversy regarding his defense of the administration against allegations from over two dozen Nobel Laureates, amongst others, that scientific evidence was being suppressed or ignored in policy decisions, including those relating to stem cell research and global warming. However, he has also been credited with keeping the political effects of the September 11 attacks from harming science research—by ensuring that tighter visa controls did not hinder the movement of those engaged in scientific research—and with increasing awareness of the relationship <b>between</b> <b>science</b> and government. He also served as the President of Stony Brook University from 1980 until 1994, and director of Brookhaven National Laboratory from 1998 until 2001.|$|E

5|$|While various {{religions}} and denominations have reconciled their beliefs with evolution through {{concepts such as}} theistic evolution, there are creationists who believe that evolution is contradicted by the creation myths found in their {{religions and}} who raise various objections to evolution. As had been demonstrated by responses to the publication of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation in 1844, the most controversial aspect of evolutionary biology is the implication of human evolution that humans share common ancestry with apes and that the mental and moral faculties of humanity have {{the same types of}} natural causes as other inherited traits in animals. In some countries, notably the United States, these tensions <b>between</b> <b>science</b> and religion have fuelled the current creation–evolution controversy, a religious conflict focusing on politics and public education. While other scientific fields such as cosmology and Earth science also conflict with literal interpretations of many religious texts, evolutionary biology experiences significantly more opposition from religious literalists.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict <b>between</b> <b>science</b> and religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means {{to accept a}} conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E
5|$|The philosopher, sociologist, {{town planner}} and writer Patrick Geddes (1854–1932) coined the phrase Scottish Renaissance in his {{magazine}} Evergreen. He argued that technological development {{needed to be}} in parallel with the arts. These ideas were taken up by a new generation, led by the poet Hugh MacDiarmid who argued for a synergy <b>between</b> <b>science</b> and art, the introduction of modernism into art {{and the creation of}} a distinctive national art. These ideas were expressed in art in the inter-war period by figures including Stanley Cursiter (1887–1976), William McCance (1894–1970), William Johnstone (1897–1981) and Fergusson. Stanley Cursiter was influenced by the Celtic revival, post-impressionism and Futurism, as can be seen in his Rain on Princess Street (1913) and Regatta (1913). He went on to be a major painter of the coastline of this native Orkney, director of the National Gallery of Scotland and proposed the creation of a National Gallery of Modern Art in 1930. Fergusson was one of the few British artists who could claim to have played a part in the creation of modernism and probably played a major part in the formulation of MacDiarmid's thought. His interest in machine imagery can be seen in paintings like Damaged Destroyer (1918). He co-operated with MacDiarmid on the journal Scottish Art and Letters and MacDiarmid quoted extensively from his work.|$|E
