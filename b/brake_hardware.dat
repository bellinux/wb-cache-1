50|$|Dana 44 axles {{were used}} {{both in the}} front and the rear at least through 1979. <b>Brake</b> <b>hardware</b> was mostly General Motors {{equipment}} (sourced from the straight axle 1/2 ton 4x4 light duty truck and SUV line including the six lug rims), with disc brakes up front (optional on earlier models) and drum brakes in the rear.|$|E
50|$|The offset, {{measured}} in millimeters, can be negative or positive, {{and is the}} distance from the hub-mounting surface to the rim's true centerline. A positive offset means the hub-mounting surface is closer to the outside edge of the wheel, i.e. the wheel wraps around the hub and <b>brake</b> <b>hardware</b> more deeply; a negative offset means the hub-mounting surface is closer to the inside edge of the wheel and wheel sticks outwards more than inwards.|$|E
50|$|The theory behind IMA {{is to use}} {{regenerative}} braking to recapture some of the energy lost through deceleration, and reuse that energy later on to help accelerate the vehicle. This has three effects: it increases the rate of acceleration, it reduces the work required of the engine, and reduces the frequency of <b>brake</b> <b>hardware</b> replacement. The acceleration boost is important as it allows the engine to be scaled down to a smaller but more fuel-efficient variant without rendering the vehicle overly slow or weak. This smaller engine is the primary reason cars equipped with IMA get better highway mileage than their more conventional counterparts.|$|E

40|$|Motor vehicle exhaust and non-exhaust {{processes}} play {{a significant}} role in environmental pollution, as they are a source of the finest particulate matter. Emissions from non-exhaust processes include wear-products of <b>brakes,</b> tires, automotive <b>hardware,</b> road surface, and traffic signs, but still are paid little attention to. Automotive friction composites for brake pads are composite materials which may consist of potentially hazardous materials and there is a lack of information regarding the potential influence of the brake wear debris (BWD) on the environment, especially on human health. Thus, we focused our study on the genotoxicity of the airborne fraction of BWD using a brake pad model representing an average low-metallic formulation available in the EU market. BWD was generated in the laboratory by a full-scale brake dynamometer and characterized by Raman microspectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy showing that it contains nano-sized crystalline metal-based particles. Genotoxicity tested in human lymphocytes in different testing conditions showed an increase in frequencies of micronucleated binucleated cells (MNBNCs) exposed for 48 h to BWD nanoparticles (NPs) (with 10 % of foetal calf serum in culture medium) compared with lymphocytes exposed to medium alone, statistically significant only at the concentration 3 µg/cm 2 (p= 0. 032).

40|$|Traditional Electronic Stability Control (ESC) systems {{influence}} planar vehicle {{motions to}} better match these to the driver’s intention. These systems use the Anti-lock <b>Braking</b> System (ABS) <b>hardware</b> {{to generate the}} needed tire forces. This has a large impact on longitudinal vehicle motions. A second method of altering the front wheel tire forces is Active Front Steering (AFS), which alters the steering angle of the front wheels and therefore has a lower impact on longitudinal motions. A combined braking and AFS ESC system can ensure the braking action is postponed, or not executed at all. Haptic feedback {{on the steering wheel}} has proven to be helpful in vehicle control for lanekeeping systems. If a feedback torque can be designed that will achieve the same steering angle change an AFS system would, the benefits of a combined braking and AFS ESC system can be obtained without installing extra hardware. It is exactly such a feedback torque that is investigated in this research. It will guide drivers to the maximum front axle grip to help them achieve their desired vehicle motions. The corresponding steering angle will be selected from a range of steering angles, based on the lateral front axle force that will be generated at that steering angle. To find the front axle lateral force, a Pacejka tire model will be used. The feedback system is tested on a real vehicle. Nine test drivers drove the test vehicle with and without feedback on a circle with low friction surface (skid-pad) and on a small test track to test the effect of the feedback torque on their driving behavior in constant and dynamic circumstances. They were given instructions to follow the tracks as fast as possible, so that the desired yaw rate will be the maximum possible yaw rate and the feedback torque will guide towards the maximum front axle grip. On the skid-pad the feedback controller worked as intended: drivers managed to achieve a higher yaw rate. The analysis of the behavior on the track was hampered by changed circumstances between the tests with and without feedback. The analysis did show that the controller made the vehicle ‘eager to steer’; the feedback torque advised drivers to steer more. This led to quicker corner entries, but slower corner exits. The most noticeable change was found in road position, where the haptic feedback resulted in changed and more constant driving lines. There is room for improvement of the controller: it is recommended to ensure that any feedback torque will not work against steering straight to prevent drivers from problems with exiting corners.

40|$|Previous {{studies by}} the Cambridge Vehicle Dynamics Consortium (CVDC) have {{suggested}} that, by improving the control bandwidth of conventional Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) brake actuators and using a ‘slip control’ braking strategy, HGV stopping distances could be reduced by up to 30 % over existing systems. The work covered in this thesis looks to: validate the CVDC’s previous braking performance predictions through Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) simulation, investigate how in-plane tyre dynamics may influence such a system’s performance, develop and build a next generation high-bandwidth braking system for vehicle implementation and carry out comparative back-to-back vehicle tests between the new system and commercially available HGV ABS. An introduction to HGV <b>brake</b> <b>hardware</b> and control is presented in Chapter 1. This is followed by straight-line braking simulations of a HGV using a HiL test rig in Chapter 2. In these tests, a conventional ABS is compared to a prototype braking system consisting of highspeed pneumatic valves (designed by a previous CVDC researcher) and a sliding mode slip controller. Results indicate that the novel system could reduce stopping distances and air consumption by 21 % and 17 % respectively. Chapter 3 considers the influence of longitudinal tyre dynamics on the straight-line braking performance of a HGV slip control system. A novel, HGV specific, dynamic tyre model is presented. Two vibration modes involving the tyre tread band and wheel hub (an in-phase mode at 20 Hz, and an anti-phase mode at 55 Hz) are identified that can influence {{the performance of a}} slip control system. It is shown that a gain scheduled sliding mode slip controller can be designed to be robust to oscillations in wheel speed associated with these modes. Overspinning of the wheel hub during brake release (a phenomenon seen in conventional ABS vehicle test data) is also correctly predicted by the novel tyre model. Chapter 4 focuses on the design of a next generation high-speed ABS modulator valve suitable for installation on a test vehicle. Prototype valve blocks are built and shown to meet the requirements of a typical UK semi-trailer. Frequency response tests with the new valves indicate that the system can achieve a pressure control bandwidth of 10 Hz, significantly higher than the previous generation high-speed valve system (6 Hz) and conventional ABS hardware (1. 5 Hz). Chapter 5 discusses the installation of high-speed ABS modulator valves on a tri-axle semi-trailer. Straight-line braking tests are then carried out in Chapter 6 – comparing the new valve system with conventional ABS. On average, stopping distance and air use are reduced by 15 ± 3 % and 50 ± 10 % respectively. An increase in Mean Fully Developed Deceleration (MFDD) of 16 ± 4 % is also achieved by the new system...|$|E
