50|$|Despite the {{complexity}} of modern components - huge <b>ball</b> <b>grid</b> <b>arrays</b> and tiny passive components - schematic capture is easier today {{than it has been}} for many years.

5000|$|Some {{countries}} have exempted medical and telecommunication infrastructure {{products from the}} legislation. [...] However, {{this may be a}} moot point, since as electronic component manufacturers convert their production lines to producing only lead-free parts, conventional parts with eutectic tin-lead solder will simply not be available, even for military, aerospace and industrial users. To the extent that only solder is involved, this is at least partially mitigated by many lead-free components' compatibility with lead-containing solder processes. Leadframe-based components, such as Quad Flat Packages (QFP), Small Outline Integrated Circuits (SOIC), and Small outline packages (SOP) with gull wing leads, are generally compatible since the finish on the part leads contributes a small amount of material to the finished joint. However, components such as <b>Ball</b> <b>grid</b> <b>arrays</b> (BGA) which come with lead-free solder balls and leadless parts are often not compatible with lead-containing processes.|$|E
5000|$|The company {{devised a}} method for {{applying}} strain gage testing to determining the stresses placed on circuit boards by the {{hundreds or thousands of}} test probes used to make electrical contact therewith. [...] This is useful because each test probe (a.k.a. [...] "pogo pin") exerts several ounces of force on the DUT (Device Under Test). When the test fixture has thousands of test probes, the sum of the individual probe forces can reach hundreds of pounds. Such force is sufficient to deform the DUT (a printed circuit board, for example) {{to the point where the}} attached inflexible electronic component packages (such as <b>Ball</b> <b>Grid</b> <b>Arrays)</b> may fracture, or their solder joints may fail. Strain gage testing can reveal areas on the DUT where these net forces are excessive when the DUT is clamped into the test fixture, thus showing where supports must be added to the opposite side of the test fixture to counteract the test probe forces. Where a support counteracts the test probe forces, the test probe force is converted from a deformative force distorting the DUT to a compressive force, squeezing the DUT circuit board without deforming its generally planar shape.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} {{of intermetallic compounds}} (IMCs) at the solder-substrate interface is essential in the manufacturing of solder joints. In this study, the effect of Ni addition into Sn-Cu lead-free solders on mechanical properties of the IMCs formed at the interface between solder <b>ball</b> <b>grid</b> <b>arrays</b> (BGAs) and Cu substrates, which experienced multiple reflows, were investigated. The results from nanoindentation tests showed that elastic modulus and hardness of (Cu,Ni) (6) Sn(5) were {{higher than those of}} Cu(6) Sn(5). The hardnesses of (Cu,Ni) (6) Sn(5) were more scattered compared to those of Cu(6) Sn(5). which may be attributed to the crystallographic characteristics such as growth texture of the IMCs.
