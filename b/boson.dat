50|$|The Georgi-Glashow model predicts {{additional}} gauge <b>bosons</b> named X and Y <b>bosons.</b> The hypothetical X and Y <b>bosons</b> direct {{interactions between}} quarks and leptons, hence violating conservation of baryon number and causing proton decay.

50|$|Gauge <b>bosons</b> are {{different}} from the other kinds of bosons: first, fundamental scalar <b>bosons</b> (the Higgs boson); second, mesons, which are composite <b>bosons,</b> made of quarks; third, larger composite, non-force-carrying <b>bosons,</b> such as certain atoms.|$|R

25|$|Weak <b>boson</b> fusion. Another {{possibility}} {{when two}} (anti-)fermions collide {{is that the}} two exchange a virtual W or Z <b>boson,</b> which emits a Higgs <b>boson.</b> The colliding fermions {{do not need to be}} the same type. So, for example, an up quark may exchange a Z <b>boson</b> with an anti-down quark. This process is the second most important for the production of Higgs particle at the LHC and LEP.|$|E
25|$|To produce Higgs bosons, two {{beams of}} {{particles}} are accelerated to very high energies {{and allowed to}} collide within a particle detector. Occasionally, although rarely, a Higgs <b>boson</b> will be created fleetingly {{as part of the}} collision byproducts. Because the Higgs <b>boson</b> decays very quickly, particle detectors cannot detect it directly. Instead the detectors register all the decay products (the decay signature) and from the data the decay process is reconstructed. If the observed decay products match a possible decay process (known as a decay channel) of a Higgs <b>boson,</b> this indicates that a Higgs <b>boson</b> may have been created. In practice, many processes may produce similar decay signatures. Fortunately, the Standard Model precisely predicts the likelihood of each of these, and each known process, occurring. So, if the detector detects more decay signatures consistently matching a Higgs <b>boson</b> than would otherwise be expected if Higgs bosons did not exist, then this would be strong evidence that the Higgs <b>boson</b> exists.|$|E
25|$|Since the Higgs {{field is}} scalar, the Higgs <b>boson</b> has no spin. The Higgs <b>boson</b> is also its own {{antiparticle}} and is CP-even, and has zero electric and colour charge.|$|E

25|$|Higgs Strahlung. If an {{elementary}} fermion collides with an anti-fermion—e.g., a quark with an anti-quark or an electron with a positron—the two can merge {{to form a}} virtual W or Z <b>boson</b> which, if it carries sufficient energy, can then emit a Higgs <b>boson.</b> This process was the dominant production mode at the LEP, where an electron and a positron collided to form a virtual Z <b>boson,</b> {{and it was the}} second largest contribution for Higgs production at the Tevatron. At the LHC this process is only the third largest, because the LHC collides protons with protons, making a quark-antiquark collision less likely than at the Tevatron. Higgs Strahlung is also known as associated production.|$|E

25|$|Evidence of the Higgs {{field and}} its {{properties}} {{has been extremely}} significant for many reasons. The importance of the Higgs <b>boson</b> is largely that {{it is able to}} be examined using existing knowledge and experimental technology, as a way to confirm and study the entire Higgs field theory. Conversely, proof that the Higgs field and <b>boson</b> do not exist would have also been significant.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2012 discovery, it {{was still}} {{unconfirmed}} {{whether or not the}} 125 GeV/c2 particle was a Higgs <b>boson.</b> On one hand, observations remained consistent with the observed particle being the Standard Model Higgs <b>boson,</b> and the particle decayed into {{at least some of the}} predicted channels. Moreover, the production rates and branching ratios for the observed channels broadly matched the predictions by the Standard Model within the experimental uncertainties. However, the experimental uncertainties currently still left room for alternative explanations, meaning an announcement of the discovery of a Higgs <b>boson</b> would have been premature. To allow more opportunity for data collection, the LHC's proposed 2012 shutdown and 2013–14 upgrade were postponed by 7 weeks into 2013.|$|E

40|$|When the {{spontaneous}} symmetry breaking occurs for systems without Lorentz covariance, there arises possible mismatch, N_ NG < N_ BG, between numbers of Nambu-Goldstone (NG) <b>bosons</b> (N_ NG) {{and the numbers}} of broken generators (N_ BG. In such a situation, so-called type-II NG <b>bosons</b> emerge. We study how the gauge <b>bosons</b> acquire masses through the Higgs mechanism under this mismatch by employing gauge theories with complex scalar field at finite chemical potential and by enforcing "charge" neutrality. To separate the physical spectra from unphysical ones, the R_ξ gauge is adopted. Not only massless NG <b>bosons</b> but also massive scalar <b>bosons</b> generated by the chemical potential are absorbed into spatial components of the gauge <b>bosons.</b> Although the chemical potential induces a non-trivial mixings among the scalar <b>bosons</b> and temporal components of the gauge <b>bosons,</b> it {{does not affect the}} structure of the physical spectra, so that the total number of physical modes is not modified even for N_ NG < N_ BG.
