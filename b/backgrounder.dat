2500|$|Nonetheless, in {{contrast}} to ANSWER, NION has a broad set of endorsers and is generally regarded as a cooperative participant in the broader anti-war movement. An October 2002 article by Michael Albert and Stephen R. Shalom in Z magazine is typical among expressions by anti-war critics of the RCP that, despite its origins, NION is a cooperative participant in the movement. After excoriating the RCP for holding various positions that Albert and Shalom find abhorrent, they then write, [...] "Despite these views, however, RCP does not push its specific positions on NION {{to the degree that}} IAC does on ANSWER. For example, while the ANSWER website offers such things as... IAC <b>backgrounder</b> on Afghanistan..., the NION website and its public positions have no connection to the sometimes bizarre views of the RCP." [...] This is reflected in the wide range of signatories to their [...] "Statement of Conscience".|$|E

30|$|Moving {{objects such}} as humans or {{vehicles}} are often the focus of image sequence analysis. The segmentation of moving objects is the first key problem which can be formulated as a <b>background</b> subtraction. In that sense, the <b>background</b> scene is modeled. Object pixels are segmented when they {{are found to be}} different from the <b>background</b> model. A common <b>background</b> subtraction framework contains <b>background</b> modeling, joint background/foreground classification, and <b>background</b> model updating. Survey on <b>background</b> subtraction techniques can be found in [1]. Sobral and Vacavant [2] presented a recent review and evaluation of 29 <b>background</b> subtraction methods. <b>Background</b> subtraction techniques can be categorized based on the ways to model the <b>background</b> scene. For instance, the <b>background</b> scene can be characterized in terms of statistical parameters. Bouwmans [3] presented a survey on statistical <b>background</b> modeling. Alternatively, the <b>background</b> model is represented as a bag of visual words—intensities or colors sampled over a short image sequence. Texture-based methods model the <b>background</b> scene by analyzing the relationship between the neighboring pixels.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Moving object {{detection}} and segmentation {{is a fundamental}} technology for video applications. <b>Background</b> subtraction is a basic component step for this task: given a frame in the video sequence, a moving object can be detected by spotting {{the parts of the}} frame that do not fit the <b>background</b> model. Therefore, a high performance <b>background</b> modeling and <b>background</b> updating algorithm is crucial for <b>background</b> subtraction. We work with a fixed camera in a stationary scene and a simple non-statistical <b>background</b> model is utilized, therefore we formulate the problem of <b>background</b> subtraction as the problem of <b>background</b> updating. This paper proposes a novel and efficient <b>background</b> updating algorithm based on the logic AND and XOR relationship of the change information in difference frames. Key-Words: <b>background</b> subtraction (BS), <b>background</b> modeling, <b>background</b> updating (BU), dynamic thresholding, logic relationship. ...|$|R

In June 2015, the ACLU penned an open letter to Jeh Johnson with recommendations for improving PEP. Among the recommendations in the letter was the requirement that the probable cause notices be approved by a judge (i.e., judicially determined). ACLU's criticism of PEP was covered by the Washington Post in an article on the program's rollout.|$|E

30|$|As {{security}} monitoring {{emerges as}} an important issue, {{there has been an}} increasing demand for intelligent surveillance systems. Key operations in intelligent surveillance include object tracking, abnormal behavior detection, and behavior understanding. Accurate <b>background</b> subtraction plays an important role. The goal of <b>background</b> subtraction is to eliminate <b>background</b> components and detect meaningful moving objects. In real environments, due to various and complex <b>background</b> types such as moving escalators, waving tree branches, water fountains, and flickering monitors, <b>background</b> subtraction is a difficult task. Researchers have overcome these problems by using <b>background</b> modeling. Simple <b>background</b> models assume static <b>background</b> images. <b>Background</b> components can generally be eliminated by computing the difference between an input image and the <b>background</b> image that was modeled using average, low-pass filtering, and median filtering[1 – 4]. For instance, in[1], the median <b>background</b> image was used to subtract the <b>background</b> components. Since temporal median filtering is time-consuming, a fast algorithm utilizing the characteristics of adjacent frames was proposed[2]. Cheng et al. applied a recursive mean procedure to compute <b>background</b> images[3]. In[4], low-pass filtering was utilized to estimate a static <b>background</b> image. However, these approaches cannot handle dynamic <b>backgrounds</b> and are sensitive to threshold values.|$|R

5000|$|Another major {{criticism}} of Clarke {{was that he}} had been more supportive of the Bush administration when he worked there as a special advisor to the President. Fox News Channel released a transcript from an August 2002 briefing that Clarke gave to reporters while he was still working for the White House, as background (meaning not for attribution). In it Clarke says that [...] "there was no plan on al Qaeda that was passed from the Clinton administration to the Bush administration," [...] and otherwise puts the Bush administration in a more favorable light. Questioned about this apparent inconsistency, Clarke said the differences were [...] "really a matter here of emphasis and tone. I mean, what you're suggesting, perhaps, is that as special assistant {{to the president of the}} United States when asked to give a press <b>backgrounder</b> I should spend my time in that press <b>backgrounder</b> criticizing him.

50|$|A <b>background</b> {{light is}} used to {{illuminate}} the <b>background</b> area of a set.

Four-point lighting {{is the same as}} three-point lighting {{with the addition of a}} <b>background</b> light. In a four-point lighting, the <b>background</b> light is placed last and is usually placed directly behind the subject and pointed at the <b>background.</b> By adding a <b>background</b> light to a set, filmmakers can add a sense of depth to shots.|$|R
