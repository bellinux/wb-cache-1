5|$|Hare {{coursing}} is {{the pursuit}} of hares with greyhounds and other sighthounds, which chase the hare <b>by</b> <b>sight</b> and not by scent.|$|E
5|$|Some {{angler fish}} {{of the deep}} sea, where it is too dark to hunt <b>by</b> <b>sight,</b> contain {{symbiotic}} bacteria in the 'bait' on their 'fishing rods'. These emit light to attract prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{midbrain}} (or mesencephalon) {{contains the}} two optic lobes. These are very large in species that hunt <b>by</b> <b>sight,</b> such as rainbow trout and cichlids.|$|E

25|$|Braille was {{originally}} intended, and is frequently portrayed, as a re-encoding of the English orthography used <b>by</b> <b>sighted</b> people. However, braille {{is an independent}} writing system, not {{a variant of the}} printed English alphabet.|$|R
5|$|Beetles, both {{adults and}} larvae, are the prey of many animal predators {{including}} mammals from bats to rodents, birds, lizards, amphibians, fishes, dragonflies, robberflies, reduviid bugs, ants, other beetles, and spiders. Beetles {{use a variety}} of anti-predator adaptations to defend themselves. These include camouflage and mimicry against predators that hunt <b>by</b> <b>sight,</b> toxicity, and defensive behaviour.|$|E
5|$|New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses <b>by</b> <b>sight,</b> New World vultures have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they locate carcasses.|$|E
5|$|Spicer took {{written and}} oral {{testimony}} {{from a number}} of witnesses over more than a month. Accounts by both participants and eye-witnesses were contradictory. Those loyal to {{one side or the other}} told conflicting stories and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants <b>by</b> <b>sight</b> were unable to say for certain who shot first.|$|E
50|$|The {{event is}} for athletes {{with the highest}} level of visual disability, and runners run in blindfolds, and are {{assisted}} <b>by</b> <b>sighted</b> guides. As such, races contain 4 rather than 8 athletes. Guides of medal winners are also awarded medals.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} sub-national and {{international}} borders {{were intended to}} be defined by, or are approximated by, parallels. Parallels make convenient borders in the northern hemisphere because astronomic latitude can be roughly measured (to within a few tens of meters) <b>by</b> <b>sighting</b> the North Star.|$|R
40|$|Human wayfinding, both <b>by</b> <b>sighted</b> and {{visually}} impaired people, consists of two very different functions: 1. sensing of the immediate environment, including obstacles and physically defined paths, {{for the purposes of}} moving through it, and 2. navigating to remote destinations beyond the immediately perceptible environment...|$|R

5|$|The {{discipline}} of anatomy can be subdivided {{into a number}} of branches including gross or macroscopic anatomy and microscopic anatomy. Gross anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes superficial anatomy or surface anatomy, the study <b>by</b> <b>sight</b> of the external body features. Microscopic anatomy is the study of structures on a microscopic scale, including histology (the study of tissues), and embryology (the study of an organism in its immature condition).|$|E
50|$|Today, the {{traditional}} repertoire of the kobzars is performed <b>by</b> <b>sighted,</b> educated performers.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the perceptions held <b>by</b> <b>sighted</b> students and {{students with visual impairments}} of the intelligibility and comprehensibility of similar acoustic patterns produced by synthetic speech. It determined the types of errors the students made and compared the performance of the two groups on auditory discrimination and comprehension...|$|R

5|$|The {{olfactory}} bulb {{is a special}} structure that processes olfactory sensory signals and sends its output to the olfactory part of the pallium. It is a major brain component in many vertebrates, but is greatly reduced in humans and other primates (whose senses are dominated by information acquired <b>by</b> <b>sight</b> rather than smell).|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} is omnivorous, eating {{a wide range}} of invertebrates, {{especially}} earthworms and snails, as well as soft fruit and berries. Like its relative, the blackbird, the song thrush finds animal prey <b>by</b> <b>sight,</b> has a run-and-stop hunting technique on open ground, and will rummage through leaf-litter seeking potential food items.|$|E
5|$|Who started {{shooting}} first is not certain; accounts by both participants and eyewitnesses are contradictory. The {{smoke from the}} black powder used in the weapons added to the confusion of the gunfight in the narrow space. Those loyal to {{one side or the}} other told conflicting stories, and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants <b>by</b> <b>sight</b> were unable to say for certain who shot first. The six or seven men with guns fired about 30 shots in around 30 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Camouflage uses any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment to make the organism hard to detect <b>by</b> <b>sight.</b> It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can be achieved in many different ways, such as through resemblance to surroundings, disruptive coloration, shadow elimination, self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and color. Animals such as the flat-tail horned lizard of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and {{blend in with the}} ground. The bodies of these lizards are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the lizards to effectively hide their shadows. Additionally, these lizards hide any remaining shadows by pressing their bodies to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas use {{a variety}} of {{strategies}} to evade predators. Large cicadas can fly rapidly to escape if disturbed. Many are extremely well camouflaged to evade predators such as birds that hunt <b>by</b> <b>sight.</b> As well as being coloured like tree bark, they are disruptively patterned to break up their outlines; their partly transparent wings are held over the body and pressed close to the substrate. The wings are antireflective, avoiding the typical shine of insect cuticle, which would break the cicada's camouflage. Some cicada species play dead when threatened.|$|E
5|$|European nightjars hunt <b>by</b> <b>sight,</b> silhouetting {{their prey}} against the night sky. They tend to flycatch from a perch on moonlit nights, but fly {{continuously}} on darker nights when prey {{is harder to}} see. Hunting frequency reduces {{in the middle of}} the night. Although they have very small bills, the mouth can be opened very wide as they catch insects. They have long sensitive bristles around the mouth, which may help to locate or funnel prey into the mouth. Indigestible parts of insects, such as the chitin exoskeleton, are regurgitated as pellets.|$|E

[...] The film then follows {{his days as}} an inventor in Brantford, Ontario, Boston, Massachusetts, and Baddeck, Nova Scotia. The film was shot in New Zealand and on location at Alexander Graham Bell's Beinn Bhreagh estate in Baddeck, Nova Scotia, Canada.|$|R
