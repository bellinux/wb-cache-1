50|$|In 1844, a {{new company}} {{purchased}} the mine and renamed it West Tolgus and Treloweth, and just West Tolgus from 1850. It closed in 1851 and again reopened in 1860 after being bought by John Taylor and Sons. Managed by Captain Joseph Jewell, they built an engine house with a 60-inch (later 65 then 70) pumping engine and a 10-foot stroke, enabling mining to reach a depth of 312 feet or 52 fathoms by April 1862. It employed over 120 people {{at the time and}} by 1879 over 230. During the 1870s a series of accidents caused the mine to flood, including flooding in 1873 when it closed by five months and flooding again in January 1879 when the <b>balance</b> <b>bob</b> broke in two places in Richards' Shaft. After the accidents and the fact the mine was not especially economically viable it ceased operations for the final time in February 1884.|$|E

5000|$|In June 1847 {{the mine}} captain, John Spargo, {{proposed}} {{a number of}} improvements, including the installation of a 50 ft (15 m) waterwheel and new stamps, and the sinking of new shafts, the whole costing a total of nearly £1,000. Much of this work was undertaken, but by October the same year, the first signs that all was not well appeared in The Mining Journal. The shares had not been well taken up {{and the lack of}} money was causing problems. By the following March it was reported that the mine could not continue in operation and a final call of £1 per share was being made to clear the debts of the company. It was clear that no tin had been sold.

In 1849 Captain Spargo reported that the stamps were working well and a shaft had been deepened to 20 fathoms below adit. But problems reappeared and in 1851 it was advertised—for the last time—as [...] "Wheal Ruth" [...] with 2,700 shares offered at £2 each. This new concern employed only a few men, but operated successfully for a time, selling 1 ton 4 cwt 11 lb of ore for £61. 9s in September 1851 and over two tons for more than £107 {{in the last quarter of}} the year. However, on 25 September 1852 The Mining Journal ran an advert for the sale of all the mine's equipment by public auction. Since the price of tin was rising again at this time, it is most likely that the mine had become exhausted of tin that was recoverable economically.|$|R

40|$|The {{discount}} window refers to lending {{by each of}} the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks to depository institutions. Discount window loans generally fund {{only a small part}} of bank reserves. For example, during 1990 and 1991, {{discount window}} loans averaged just over 1 percent of total reserves. Nevertheless, the window is perceived as an important tool for reserve adjustment, and at times it has been an important part of the Federal Reserve's monetary control procedures. HOW THE DISCOUNT WINDOW WORKS Discount window lending takes place through the reserve accounts depository institutions are required to maintain at their Federal Reserve Banks. In other words, banks borrow reserves at the discount window. This is illustrated in balance sheet form in Table 1. Suppose the funding officer at Bob's Bank finds it has an unanticipated reserve deficiency of $ 1 million and decides to go to the discount window for an overnight loan in order to cover it. Once the loan is approved, Bob's Bank's reserve account is increased by $ 1 million. This shows up on the asset side of <b>Bob's</b> <b>balance</b> sheet as an increase in "Reserves with Federal Reserve Bank, " and on the liability side as an increase in "Borrowings from Federal Reserve Bank. " The transaction also shows up on the Federal Reserve Bank's balance sheet as an increase in "Discounts and Advances" on the asset side and an increase in "Bank Reserve Accounts " on the liability side.

25|$|As in the First and Fourth Tests Australia {{were left}} to improve a large first innings lead and set England a target with a declaration. Rick McCosker was caught by wicketkeeper off Arnold on 16/1, but there were few other {{problems}} for the home side who ended the day on 111/2. England could have taken more wickets as Fletcher and Cowdrey both dropped Ian Chappell, who hit Underwood for six, then made an indecisive drive-sweep that skied the ball to Knott for 41. In the intervening rest day the players were invited to the Barossa Valley vineyard of 'Windy' Hill-Smith, where Jeff Thomson sprained his shoulder playing tennis. The following day he found {{that he could not}} raise his bowling arm and that he was out of cricket {{for the rest of the}} series, having taken a remarkable 33 wickets (17.93) in four and a half Tests. To <b>balance</b> the books <b>Bob</b> Willis was also out for the rest of the series with his recurring knee cap injury. Redpath and Greg Chappell lasted the day, but were both out in the morning to Underwood (4/102) to leave Australia 133/4 as only 24 runs were scored in the first 12 overs of the day. Doug Walters (71 not out) and Rod Marsh (55) were more aggressive and took 10 runs off one Underwood over. Marsh swept the spinner, once for six, twice to see Knott spill a running catch and third to be caught by Greig. Chappell waited for a few more overs before declaring at 272/5, 404 runs ahead with 500 minutes of play left, very similar to the situation at Sydney.|$|R
40|$|This project {{compares the}} {{performance}} of two different heating and cooling systems. These two systems are a water based system, which is mainly based on Thermally Activated Building Systems (TABS), and an air based system, {{which is based on}} a simple heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. A climate classification for the use of TABS has been created in the current project. The intention of this classification is to determine in which climate zones a building requires to implement a heating, a cooling or a dehumidification system. A climate classification system that considers dehumidification is important when TABS are implemented, since risk of condensation can be a problem when these systems are used for cooling requirements. The new European Climate Classification (ECC) system is based on a combination of the annual number of heating and cooling degree days and the outdoor dew-point temperature. Four different thermal categories, which are defined by the number of heating and cooling degree days, and three dew-point categories, which are defined by the dew-point temperature, are introduced in the ECC system. In total, the current classification is based on twelve possible final climate categories and has been evaluated in 92 European cities. Some parameters have been introduced in thermal and dew-point categories. These parameters are investigated in a parametric analysis conducted in this project. This analysis investigates how changing some parameters in the ECC system affects the location of the different climate zones in the map of Europe. As shown in this analysis these parameters {{have a significant effect on}} the climate classification of the locations in Europe. Only two of the five initial base temperature cases were evaluated in the entire parametric analysis as more suitable classifications for Europe according to existing climate classifications were obtained with these two cases. These base temperature cases are HDD 18 °C/CDD 18 °C and HDD 16 °C/CDD 19 °C. Thermal comfort and energy consumption are compared between water and air based systems using the building simulation program IDA ICE. The performance of both systems is tested in ten European cities classified in seven different climate zones found with the ECC system. The comparative analysis is carried out in four different offices of the <b>Balanced</b> Office Building (<b>BOB)</b> in Achen, Germany. The BOB is an energy-efficient and well-insulated office building in which TABS are implemented for cooling and heating requirements. The shading devices implemented at the beginning are modified for offices A, C and/or E, according to each city case, in order to improve thermal comfort. For all ten locations the initial shading coefficients have been reduced for office C, since during the first simulations it was found that indoor temperatures were too high in this office...|$|R
