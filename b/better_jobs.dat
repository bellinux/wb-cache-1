25|$|Approximately 20 more {{banks were}} {{established}} during this period, which also saw African Americans become active citizens by {{taking part in}} various social movements centered around economic equality, better housing, <b>better</b> <b>jobs,</b> and the desegregation of society. Through desegregation however, these banks could no longer solely depend on the Black community for business and were forced to become established on the open market, by paying their employees competitive wages, and were now required {{to meet the needs}} of the entire society instead of just the Black community.|$|E

25|$|Mobilization for World War II created {{jobs in the}} state. Thousands {{of other}} workers, black and white alike, {{migrated}} to California for <b>better</b> <b>jobs</b> in its burgeoning defense industry. Many African Americans left {{the state in the}} Second Great Migration, from the 1940s through the 1960s. The mechanization of agriculture in the 1930s had sharply cut the need for laborers. They sought skilled jobs in the defense industry in California, better education for their children, and living opportunities in communities where they could vote.|$|E
25|$|Industrial {{development}} {{related to}} the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war. Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for <b>better</b> <b>jobs</b> and a higher standard of living. One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war-related industries. Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base.|$|E
25|$|Certain changes {{occurred}} in Europe during {{the end of}} the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century that would greatly affect the lives of the French and the people of Corsica. One of those changes came about {{with the advent of the}} Second Industrial Revolution. With the Second Industrial Revolution, many of the people who worked in agriculture began to move to the larger cities with hopes of finding <b>better</b> <b>jobs</b> and better lives. Also, there was a widespread crop failure due to long periods of drought and crop diseases (e.g., the Phylloxera epidemic destroyed the Corsican wine industry), a cholera epidemic and a general deterioration of economic conditions. Thus, many of the farms in Corsica began to fail.|$|E

25|$|Kurzweil {{explains}} that in 1999 computers {{are essential to}} most facets of life, yet he predicts no major disruption related to the then-pending Y2K problem. He says computers are narrow-minded and brittle so far, but suggests in specific domains they are showing signs of intelligence. As examples Kurzweil cites computer generated or assisted music, and tools for the automatic or semi-automatic production of literature or poetry. He shows examples of paintings by AARON as programmed by Harold Cohen which can be automatically created. Kurzweil reviews some of his predictions from The Age of Intelligent Machines and various past presentations, and is very pleased with his record. Finally he predicts a new Luddite movement as intelligent machines take away jobs, although he predicts {{a net gain of}} new and <b>better</b> <b>jobs.</b>|$|E
25|$|African Americans mounted {{resistance}} to lynchings in numerous ways. Intellectuals and journalists encouraged public education, actively protesting and lobbying against lynch mob violence and government complicity. Anti-lynching plays and literary works were produced. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and related groups, organized support from {{white and black}} Americans, publicizing injustices, investigating incidents, and working for passage of federal legislation. African-American women's clubs raised funds and conducted petition drives, letter campaigns, meetings and demonstrations to highlight the issues and combat lynching. In the Great Migration, particularly from 1910 to 1940, 1.5 million African Americans left the South, primarily for destinations in northern and mid-western cities, both to gain <b>better</b> <b>jobs</b> and education and to escape {{the high rate of}} violence. From 1910 to 1930 particularly, more blacks migrated from counties with high numbers of lynchings.|$|E
500|$|After peaking in {{the late}} 19thcentury, the county's {{population}} declined during the 20th, in common {{with much of the}} rural Midwest. The widespread adoption of the automobile in the 1920s undercut small-town businesses, which were threatened further by the Great Depression of the 1930s. [...] World WarII and the economic revival of the late 1940s and 1950s drew people to <b>better</b> <b>jobs</b> in growing regional cities, and this further diminished small towns. [...] The population shrank again in the 1980s due largely to the effects of the [...] "farm crisis" [...] of low crop prices, high farmer debt and other economic causes.|$|E

His parents taught him Hungarian and he spoke Romanian with his friends.|$|E
