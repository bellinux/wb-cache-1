40|$|The Xianshuihe {{fault of}} western Sichuan Province, China, {{is one of}} the world's most active faults, having {{produced}} 4 earthquakes during this century of magnitude ≥ 7 along a 350 -km length of the fault. At least 8 such events have occurred since 1725. In the more limited 150 -km-long segment including Luhuo and Daofu, major earthquakes in 1904, 1923, 1973, and 1981 (M = 7, 7 ½, 7. 6, 6. 9) were associated with overlapping surficial fault ruptures and with individual left-lateral displacements as large as 3. 6 m. Field studies indicate that this high degree of activity is typical of the fault's longer-term history. The Holocene left-lateral slip rate on the north-western segment of the fault has been 15 ± 5 mm/yr, decreasing to about 5 mm/yr on its southeastern segment, based on radiometrically dated offset stream-channel and terrace deposits and on offset glacial moraines. Physiographic features of active faulting are fully as diagrammatic as those of California's San Andreas fault, mainly because of high-altitude preservation and the absence of cultural modification on this eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Detailed en echelon tensional and pushup features resulting from surface ruptures in 1973, 1955, 1923, and 1893 can still be recognized today, and new data have been collected bearing on the offsets and fault-rupture lengths during these and other events. The locations and magnitudes of historic earthquakes suggest that the characteristic earthquake model may apply to the Xianshuihe fault. Obvious geometric segmentation of the fault has controlled the initiation and termination of ruptures in some events, whereas segmentation control for others remains obscure. Based on the historic record, repeat times estimated from slip rates, and current seismic gaps, two segments are particularly likely sites for M = 7 + earthquakes in the near future: the 65 -km-long segment between Daofu and Qianning, and the 135 -km-long segment <b>bracketing</b> Kangding. Continuing <b>creep</b> has been documented along some segments of the fault, and this, together with the high degree of activity and other unique attributes, makes the Xianshuihe fault {{one of the most promising}} sites in the world for earthquake prediction and hazard-evaluation studies...|$|R

40|$|Australian taxpayers face {{a future}} tax {{increase}} of $ 1, 180 {{a year on}} average if nothing is done about <b>bracket</b> <b>creep,</b> according to this report. Introduction There is a large gap between what the Australian government raises in taxes and what it spends. As a result, the government has posted eight consecutive budget deficits, and the former Treasurer Joe Hockey has stated the budget may never get back to surplus under current policies. In addition, many commentators are calling for additional revenue to be raised to reduce the budget deficit or provide scope for additional government spending. Nevertheless, there are many arguments against increasing personal taxes. Most importantly, they are inefficient taxes that have substantial harmful impacts on work, saving, investment and growth. But also no clear case {{has been made to}} increase taxes instead of curbing spending growth. The importance of tax reform has been acknowledged by many governments in Australia’s recent history. The previous Labor government commissioned the Australia’s Future Tax System Review, chaired by Dr Ken Henry, in 2008. The Final Report of the review was released in 2010; however, most of the recommendations of the Henry review were not implemented. The Coalition government has now initiated its own tax review and released a discussion paper on 30 March 2015, called Re:think. The government must seize the opportunity from this process to fix some of the glaring problems with Australia’s tax system. The Re:think discussion paper specifically raises the problem of <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> (or fiscal drag), when average tax rates rise automatically in an economy with inflation and growing wages. Our paper shows <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> is causing substantial tax increases and as a result is reducing employment and labour force participation. As the Re:think discussion paper notes, Australia relies more on income taxes than other developed (OECD) countries. This causes our tax system to be more inefficient, because income taxes have more adverse effects than other taxes. It also means that <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> has a greater impact in Australia than in other countries. Importantly, <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> isn’t just inefficient; this paper demonstrates it also is regressive because it disproportionately hits low- to middle-income earners. Nevertheless, the excuses not to fix <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> multiply as the demands for increased government spending continue and a number of spending commitments, such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), are locked in. However, as this report will show, the consequences of ignoring <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> are severe. Fixing <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> must be a serious priority for all politicians.  ...|$|E

40|$|Utilizing three U. S.

Heretofore, the public finance literature has argued that periodic discretionary tax cuts have offset past inflation-induced <b>bracket</b> <b>creep.</b> A problem with discerning whether discretionary tax cuts offset <b>bracket</b> <b>creep,</b> however, is that one’s conclusion is sensitive to the base year from which one indexes. Looking at public spending tendencies and voting patterns on indexation represents an alternative approach to the issue. If government naturally rebates inflation-induced revenue gains, support for or opposition to indexation would not be associated with senators ’ spending tendencies, since indexation per se would have {{no impact on the}} size of the funded budget. This study shows, however, that the more liberal are senatorial spending tendencies, the greater is the likelihood of opposition to indexation.

40|$|John Quiggin {{looks at}} the longer term trend in average tax rates DURING the 1980 s and 1990 s, governments faced chronic {{difficulties}} in meeting growing demands for public expenditure {{on a wide range}} of services, while experiencing weak growth in revenue and fierce resistance to any increase in taxation (the ‘tax revolt’). The problem was referred to in academic circles as ‘the fiscal crisis of the state’. In response to these problems, governments adopted a pattern of fiscal policy geared to the electoral cycle. The first budget after an election, particularly an election involving a change of government, was always a tough one, with election promises being discarded, expenditure programs cut and a focus on reducing the budget deficit. Although income tax rates were never increased the operation of <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> (discussed below) ensured an automatic increase in the average rate of taxation. If the first-year cuts were successful in restoring balance, the government sought to maintain this position in its second year, before offering tax cuts and new expenditure in its election-year budget. After nearly fifteen years of steady economic expansion, the federal government has finally reached a point where it has more than enough revenue to meet its expenditure needs. As a result, the Howard government has reverted to a more traditional electoral-budget cycle. The budget before the election, and the promises made during the election were aimed at securing the support of swinging voters in marginal seats. The post-election budget is designed almost exclusively to reward the government’s core supporters, those on incomes well above average weekly earnings. This point is clearly illustrated by last week’s budget. Those on less than $ 55, 000 per year received only a $ 300 tax reduction, which is supposed to cover both 2005 - 06 and 2006 - 07. This is about nine months worth of <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> for someone on $ 40, 000 a year. By contrast, those on higher incomes not only receive large tax cuts but benefit from the abolition of the superannuation surcharge. In view of the political calculations that go into any individual budget, it’s more useful to look at the change in average rates of income tax over the Howard government’s period in office. Before considering this, it is necessary to look at the idea of <b>bracket</b> <b>creep,</b> which actually refers to two distinct effects of a progressive tax system. As nominal incomes rise, the operation of a progressive tax system ensures that the proportion of income collected in income tax rises steadily. This phenomenon is actually two effects in one. Real <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> arises when real economic growth raises average incomes. From a public finance point of view, some real <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> is desirable, because, as income rises, so does the demand for the kinds of goods and services usually financed by governments, such as health, education and law and order. Real <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> ensures that this demand can be met. Nominal <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> arises when money incomes are pushed up by inflation, and is definitely a bad thing. With no real change in their circumstances, workers face increasing rates of tax. During the 1970 s and 1980 s, nominal <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> was dominant, since growth in nominal incomes was primarily driven by inflation. Since the early 1990 s, however, inflation rates have been low, and real <b>bracket</b> <b>creep</b> has been about as important as nominal <b>bracket</b> <b>creep.</b> To assess the effects, it is best to look at the average tax rate faced by taxpayers on different multiples of average weekly earnings. Tables 1 and 2 give a comparison between the 1996 scales and those that will apply in 2006, when the second round of the budget tax cuts is phased in. 1996 Multiple AWOTE Tax paid ave rate 1 35620 8132. 8 22. 8 % 2 71240 24084. 8 33. 8 % 1. 5 53430 15714. 1 29. 4 % 0. 6 21372 3288. 48 15. 4 % 2006 Multiple AWOTE Tax paid ave rate 1 52808 11702 22. 2 % 2 105616 31819 30. 1 % 1. 5 79212 20729 26. 2 % 0. 6 31685 5365 16. 9 % Single taxpayers on average weekly ordinary time earnings faced an average income tax rate of 22. 8 per cent in 1996, and that will be pretty much unchanged at 22. 2 per cent when the second stage of the budget tax cuts are phased in in 2006. Since the GST has come in in the meantime, raising more revenue than the indirect taxes it replaced, we can conclude the tax rate for this group has risen. Also, since the mean exceeds the median, this shows most single wage-earners are paying more tax than they did in 1996. The effect is stronger at 0. 6 times AWOTE, where the average income tax rate has risen from 15. 4 per cent to 16. 9 per cent. On the other hand, for those on 1. 5 times AWOTE, the average rate has fallen from 29. 4 per cent to 26. 2 per cent, and for those on twice AWOTE, from 33. 8 per cent to 30. 1 per cent. This analysis suggests a significant reduction in the progressivity of the tax system. However, there are a number of issues that would need to be considered in a more complete analysis. First, this analysis is focused on single taxpayers. It’s important to remember, however, that the Howard government has generally given more favourable treatment to families with children than to single taxpayers. Second, the analysis assumes that people pay tax on their full income. In reality, it’s necessary to take account of tax avoidance and evasion. Finally, its important remember that the income tax is the only significant progressive element of the system. GST and other taxes are generally somewhat regressive. Except for the bottom 20 per cent, the tax system as a whole was roughly proportional before the latest changes, and is likely to become increasingly regressive if policy continues along these lines. • Professor John Quiggin is a federation fellow in economics and political science based at the University of Queensland and the Australian National University.
