5|$|A {{variety of}} {{independent}} and sectarian schools exist in Tulsa, also. Most, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>all,</b> <b>of</b> the private schools have religious affiliations with various Christian, Jewish or Muslim denominations. The Catholic Diocese of Tulsa supports {{a system of}} parochial and diocesan schools, including Bishop Kelley High School, administered by the LaSallians (French Christian Brothers). Another Catholic high school, Cascia Hall Preparatory School, is administered by Augustinians. Holland Hall School is independent but historically affiliated with the Episcopal Church. Riverfield Country Day School is non-sectarian.|$|E

However, difficulties in synchronising marine sediment cores and Greenland ice cores to the same time scale cast aspersions on the accuracy of that statement.|$|E
5|$|The German-speaking {{scientists}} who isolated and described vitaminK (in addition to naming it as such) {{did so because}} the vitamin is intimately involved in the coagulation of blood following wounding (from the German word Koagulation). At the time, most (<b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>all)</b> <b>of</b> the letters from F through to J were already designated, so {{the use of the}} letter K was considered quite reasonable.

5|$|The only {{television}} series Murphy starred in was the 1961 Whispering Smith {{in which he}} played the title character. Based on the film of the same name, the show was about a 19th-century Denver railroad investigator. Episodes were gleaned from real-life cases of the Denver Police Department. The United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency {{was concerned about the}} violent content in the show and leveled charges against the network. 26 episodes had been filmed, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them aired.|$|E
5|$|The overtures {{from the}} Gilbert and Sullivan operas remain popular, {{and there are}} many {{recordings}} of them. Most of them are structured as a potpourri of tunes from the operas. They are generally well-orchestrated, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them were composed by Sullivan. However, even those delegated to his assistants were based on an outline he provided, and in many cases incorporated his suggestions or corrections. Sullivan invariably conducted them (as well as the entire operas) on opening night, and they were included in the published scores approved by Sullivan.|$|E

5|$|Titan {{was funded}} {{primarily}} by the US Department of Energy through ORNL. Funding was sufficient to purchase the CPUs <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the GPUs so the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration agreed to fund the remaining nodes in return for computing time. ORNL scientific computing chief Jeff Nichols noted that Titan cost approximately $60 million upfront, of which the NOAA contribution was less than $10 million, but precise figures were covered by non-disclosure agreements. The full term of the contract with Cray included $97 million, excluding potential upgrades.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the project}} made strides toward {{completion}} in 1976, {{it did not}} meet Moolin's goal of having all pipe installed, insulated, and tested by winter. The final section of main pipeline was welded in place on December 6, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the pipeline was tested before winter set in. At the end of 1976, the project was 92 percent complete. The pipeline was 97.5 percent complete, the pump stations were 92 percent done, and the marine terminal stood at 83 percent. Because the terminal was the lagging portion of the project, its full work crew continued operations through the winter and into 1977.|$|E
5|$|As a {{response}} to recent obesity trends in the United States and other nations, Burger King modified its menu and food preparation practices. In addition to offering lower-fat menu item such as salads, the company has updated its nutrition guides to include dietary guidelines and other nutritional data. One of its reactions to the concerns over trans-fats was to initiate a program in January 2008 to phase out added trans-fat in its products, and to switch to pure vegetable oils that are free of hydrogenated fats. The program ended in early 2009 with a complete changeover to the new oils. Most, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>all,</b> <b>of</b> the products contain no added trans-fats; some products, such as the beef used in the hamburgers, still contain naturally occurring trans-fats.|$|E

5|$|Busoni gave many (<b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>all)</b> <b>of</b> {{his works}} opus numbers; some numbers apply {{to more than}} one work (after the {{composer}} dropped some of his earlier works from his acknowledged corpus). Nor are the composer's numbers all in temporal order. The musicologist Jürgen Kindermann has prepared a thematic catalogue of his works and transcriptions which is also used, {{in the form of the}} letters BV (for Busoni Verzeichnis, German:Busoni Index: sometimes the letters KiV for Kindermann Verzeichnis are used) followed by an identifier, to identify his compositions and transcriptions. The identifier B (for Bearbeitung, German: arrangement) is used for Busoni's transcriptions and cadenzas– e.g. BV B 1 refers to Busoni's cadenzas for Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4.|$|E
5|$|Features that {{differentiate}} {{an animal}} from {{most or all}} others are called a diagnosis. Some, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>all,</b> <b>of</b> the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism. According to Xu (2010), Sinoceratops can be distinguished based on the following diagnostic characteristics: {{there are at least}} ten robust, strongly curved hornlike processes along the rear margin of the combined parietals, {{while at the same time}} at least four hornlike processes on the combined squamosals are present; there is a large accessory fenestra in front of the antorbital fenestra (differing from all other known centrosaurines); the external margin of the parietals is only weakly undulating (differing from all other known centrosaurines); and the presence of broad-based epoccipitals (differing from all other known centrosaurines).|$|E

It was extended southerly in 1931 into the city of Ludington to US10. There was a new alignment closer to the lakeshore opened in early 1933. The northern end was extended in late 1935 to encompass the Big Sable River bridge. The last change to the routing was made in 1998 when US10 was shifted to follow James Street instead of William Street to the car ferry docks. At that time, M-116 was extended east along Ludington Avenue to end at James Street.|$|E

5|$|Momolo Mortara died in 1871, {{shortly after}} {{spending}} seven {{months in prison}} during his trial {{over the death of}} a servant girl who had fallen from the window of his apartment. He had been found guilty of murdering her by the Florentine court of appeal, but then acquitted by the court of assizes. Pope Pius IX died in 1878. The same year Marianna travelled to Perpignan in south-western France, where she had heard Edgardo was preaching, and enjoyed an emotional reunion with her son, who was pleased to see her, but disappointed when she refused his pleas to convert to Catholicism. Edgardo thereafter attempted to re-establish connections with his family, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his relatives were as receptive to him as his mother.|$|E
5|$|On 11 February 2008 the Australian Family Association (AFA), was {{publicly}} {{outraged that}} Underbelly would be screening at 8:30pm, well {{within reach of}} children, after clips of the series were leaked onto the internet. The clips highlighted the use of extreme profanities, and scenes that show a violent bashing, a cold-blooded murder, and a sexual encounter. The Nine Network defended the timeslot and the M classification, saying the clips, leaked from the Network's production department, were indeed from the series, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them made the final cut. The Network set its own classification, under the accepted rules of the Australian Commercial Television Code of Conduct. The Australian Family Association threatened to take the matter to Communications Minister Stephen Conroy if {{the content of the}} show was anything near that of an unauthorised promotional clip leaked from Nine's production department.|$|E

5|$|They are {{responsible}} for pollination of approximately {{one third of the}} United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, peaches, apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers, and strawberries. Many, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>all,</b> <b>of</b> these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., squash bees on cucurbits), but typically not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is a presumption that native pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that specific area).|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} in Arizona are not common, {{since the}} predominant wind pattern steers most storms that {{form in the}} Eastern Pacific either parallel or away from the Pacific coast of northwestern Mexico. As a result, most storms that could affect Arizona are carried away from the United States, with only 6% of all Pacific hurricanes entering US territory. Not all Arizona hurricanes originate from the Pacific Ocean, however; in July 2008 an Atlantic hurricane named Hurricane Dolly produced rainfall in the eastern portion of the state, and another Atlantic storm reached Arizona as a tropical depression. Many, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>all,</b> <b>of</b> these systems also impacted California.|$|E
5|$|The peace did not last. Miners began {{prospecting}} {{for gold}} in the watershed, including a Bear Creek tributary called Jackson Creek, where they established a mining camp in 1851 {{at the site of}} what later became Jacksonville. Indian attacks on miners that year led to U.S. Army intervention and fighting near Table Rock between Indians and the combined forces of professional soldiers and volunteer miner militias. John P. Gaines, the new territorial governor, negotiated a new treaty with some <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the Indian bands, removing them from Bear Creek and other tributaries {{on the south side of}} the main stem. At about the same time, more white emigrants, including women and children, were settling in the region. By 1852, about 28donation land claims had been filed in the Rogue Valley. Further clashes in 1853 led to the Treaty with the Rogue River (1853) that established the Table Rock Indian Reservation across the river from the federal Fort Lane. As the white population increased and Indian losses of land, food sources, and personal safety mounted, bouts of violence upstream and down continued through 1854–55, culminating in the Rogue River War of 1855–56.|$|E
