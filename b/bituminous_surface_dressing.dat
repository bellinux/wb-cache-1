40|$|Often {{the natural}} ground or soil is not {{mechanically}} {{strong enough to}} withstand the repeated applications of wheel loads without significant deformation. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} provide a structure between the wheel and natural ground or subgrade to spread the wheel loads within allowable and recoverable deformation limits. Road pavement is the structure, which serves this purpose, by supporting and distributing the applied load. The primary purposes of the pavement are to prevent excessive deformation of the subgrade and to prevent ultimate failure stage. In order to prevent excessive subgrade deformation the vertical stress oz at subgrade level has to be kept below some critical value. The two main types of pavements used in pavement construction are rigid pavements and flexible pavements. Rigid pavements are very rare in Sri Lanka and consists of very stiff reinforced or roller compacted concrete surfacing over comparatively much softer ground. Flexible pavements consist of three main layers from top to bottom, consisting of the bituminous surfacing, road base and sub base. Sometimes the subbase is not laid. The shear strength, stiffness {{and the quality of the}} material of the layers decrease in the downward direction of the pavement. The topmost layer of a flexible pavement is an asphalt concrete surfacing or any other <b>bituminous</b> <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> like Double Bituminous Surface Treatment (DBST), Single Bituminous Surface Treatment (SBST) or traditional metal and tar application. The most popular bituminous surface treatment in Sri Lanka is asphalt concrete due to its very good riding quality, durability, higher stiffness or stability, resistance to adverse climatic conditions and the ability to maintain consistent quality during manufacturing and laying. As asphalt concrete surfacing is the most modern and popular method used in flexible pavement construction, this work is limited to studies on flexible pavements with asphalt concrete surfacing. Primarily asphalt concrete is a mix of bitumen and a blend of densely graded aggregates. Mix proportions of the asphalt concrete are determined after a process of mix design to achieve the desired strength and durability against expected traffic and adverse climatic conditions by using available aggregate...|$|E

In areas with cold climate, studded tires may be allowed on passenger cars. In Sweden and Finland, studded passenger car tires account for a very large share of pavement rutting.|$|R

50|$|K-17 was {{commissioned}} by 1932. Originally, the route went through Hutchinson and ended at US-81 south of McPherson. Only the portion from just south of Hutchinson {{to the city of}} Medora was paved. The remainder of the route was gravel. Within a year, the segment from Medora to the route's northern terminus had been paved with a <b>bituminous</b> <b>surface.</b> Between 1933 and 1936, a stretch of the route in Reno County was also given a <b>bituminous</b> <b>surface.</b> In 1940, the route was extended north from its northern terminus along the route of US-81 to an intersection with K-4 in Saline County. By this time, all segments of the route had been paved. The majority of the route had a <b>bituminous</b> <b>surface,</b> but some segments had a hard surface. Between 1941 and 1945, the whole route was paved with a hard surface.|$|R

40|$|There is {{a widely}} held {{perception}} that bitumen quality has reduced over the last thirty or so years. Bitumen suppliers certainly acknowledge that changes in the supply chain have occurred. However, they maintain that this is inconsequential to performance as the products remain within {{the requirements of the}} various paving-grade bitumen specifications. A review of existing information and literature pertaining to changes in Australian paving-grade bitumen supply and the performance of <b>bituminous</b> <b>surfaces</b> is presented. Changes in the crude oil sources and refineries for the manufacture of bitumen consumed in Australia is confirmed. There is also overwhelming evidence that the crude oil source and the refining impact on measurable bitumen properties, including the rheological composition, ageing profile and even the routinely measured specification parameters. Finally, there is significant evidence indicating changes in bitumen properties impact field performance of <b>bituminous</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Although not exhaustive, these examples form a science-based argument that, yes, variable field performance of <b>bituminous</b> <b>surfaces</b> has resulted from differences in bitumen properties, likely resulting from changes in oil sources and refining. The lack of confidence in field performance of different batches or supplies of the same grade of bitumen is concerning. This presents a challenge for the broader industry and must be addressed in a collaborative manner. A supplier-purchaser-client approach is essential and increased supply chain transparency would be beneficial for establishing a working level of trust across the industry...|$|R

40|$|The {{highways}} in the Midwest {{are experiencing}} {{a considerable amount}} of truck traffic due to increased freight transportation. There is clearly a risk to the highway infrastructure caused by this additional truck traffic that will also have an increasingly detrimental effect on the safety of the citizens, the traveling public in terms of congestion, and the economy of the entire region. Traditionally the life of the pavements has been extended by a variety of rehabilitation techniques. For example, techniques used by the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) include route and crack seal, chip seal, 1 - to 4 -inch overlay, 1 - to 4 -inch inlay, heater scarification, cold in-place recycling (4 -inch), and cold milling. Recently, due to a tight maintenance budget, thin surfacing, like the ultra-thin bonded <b>bituminous</b> <b>surface</b> (NovaChip), and modified slurry seal (microsurfacing), is being used increasingly. The thin-surfacing strategy has been touted {{as one of the most}} cost-effective measures that can extend pavement life, improve ride quality, correct surface defects (leveling), improve safety characteristics, enhance appearance, and reduce road-tire noise.
