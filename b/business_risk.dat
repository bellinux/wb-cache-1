25|$|Canada {{had much}} to offer {{entrepreneurs}} and <b>business</b> <b>risk</b> takers. The population was increasing gradually, communications were advancing, and real estate was cheaper compared to that from across the river. Labour and materials also cost less in Canada {{than it did in}} the States. Walker looked into expanding over to Canada. Also with the expansion of America through the Great Western Railroad, trade opportunities opened up for businessmen like Walker. Walker ventured into Canada across the border from Detroit into what is currently known as Essex County. At this time, the population in this area was considerably smaller than that of Detroit merely consisting of small village settlements under the Township of Sandwich such as the villages of Windsor and Sandwich. Most of the land in this area was vast farm land. In 1856, he bought his first piece of land from the Labadie family through grandson Eugene Hall for £300. This transaction took place on December 22, 1856 using the British currency system that Canada was still employing at the time. A month later on January 24, 1857 he decided to acquire another 300 acres of land consisting of lots 95 and 96 for which he paid £750. Also on this day, he purchased yet another 104 acres for £250. The remainder of 1857 involved building on much of this land and Walker, still a resident of Detroit, often crossed the border to oversee the construction being done. His plan was to open a steam- powered flour mill, which didn’t exist in the area, and a distillery, in which he had very little serious competition. He also had his hands in the agricultural industry with owning cattle and hogs, as well as farming.|$|E

In addition to a petition of 32,000 signatures objecting to the termination of development on Sam & Max: Freelance Police, both Steve Purcell and the media were critical of LucasArts' decision. Purcell stated that he failed to understand quite why the game was cancelled, as he believed the development of the game was proceeding without hindrance, while the media put forward the view that LucasArts was moving to consolidate its position with low <b>business</b> <b>risk</b> Star Wars video games instead of pursuing the adventure games that had brought them success in earlier years. The cancellation of Freelance Police is often cited as the culmination in a perceived decline in the overall adventure game genre, and LucasArts later dismissed many of the designers involved with developing their adventure games, effectively ending their adventure game era.|$|E

40|$|The {{financial}} and systematic risks {{of investing in}} real estate are well-covered in applications of modern portfolio theory. However, real estate assets and their associated markets {{have a number of}} idiosyncratic characteristics that give them unique risks that are not amenable to elimination through diversification. These are <b>business</b> <b>risks</b> arising out of real estate markets, and commercial and financial aspects of real estate ownership.
