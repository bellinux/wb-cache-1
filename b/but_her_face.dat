25|$|To the Pennimans {{were born}} four children; Hortensia, who married Judge Brayton of Swanton; Udney, who {{inherited}} the homestead in Colchester; Julietta, who married Dr. Nathan Ryno Smith, a physician of Baltimore; and Adelia, {{who became the}} wife of Dr. Moody, {{one of the early}} physicians of Burlington. Two daughters of Adelia were well known in Burlington, Mrs. Mary M. Howe, and Mrs. Ella M. Goodrich, wife of Prof. E. Goodrich. Penniman’s descendants had in their possession some interesting Allen relics, but two beautiful old Copley portraits of Penniman and her mother, Mrs. Crean Brush, passed into the possession of Mr. Pell, the owner of Ft. Ticonderoga. They were painted in New York in 1771, when Frances was eleven years of age. She is quaintly arrayed in a long bodice and long full skirt with her hair pompadoured and powdered like her mother’s. <b>But</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> is strikingly bright and expressive. She holds in one slender hand a basket of flowers, a prophetic hint of that taste that brought her so much satisfaction when she became middle-aged. A Female Academy was started in Middlebury, Vermont in 1802, and Mrs. Emma Willard began the Middlebury Female Seminary there in 1811. It was to her school, first in Middlebury and then in Troy (Emma Willard School), that Adelia Penniman was sent for her education.|$|E
500|$|A Certaine Relation {{claims that}} Tannakin Skinker {{was born to}} Joachim and Parnel Skinker in 1618 in [...] "Wirkham, a neuter towne betweene the Emperour and the Hollander, scituate on the river Rhyne". Joachim Skinker is {{described}} as [...] "a man of good revenue, but of a great estate in money and cattle." [...] During Parnel's pregnancy, an elderly woman had begged her for money. Parnel was busy and refused to pay, and the old woman had left, [...] "muttering to her selfe the Divells pater noster, and was heard to say 'As the Mother is Hoggish, so Swinish shall be the Child shee goeth withall. At Tannakin's birth her body and limbs were correctly proportioned, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> had a pig's snout, [...] "not only a stain and blemish, but a deformed uglinesse, making all the rest loathsome, contemptible and odious to all that lookt upon her in her infancie." [...] The midwife who had delivered the baby was sworn to secrecy, and the Skinkers raised her in a private room. She ate from a silver trough, [...] "to which she stooped and ate, just like a Swine doth in his swilling tub".|$|E
2500|$|A bold {{attempt by}} Doran's {{daughter}} Arianne Martell and her lover, Ser Arys Oakheart of the Kingsguard, to crown Doran's ward Myrcella Baratheon as queen of Westeros under Dornish law, {{by which the}} eldest child succeeds regardless of gender, is thwarted by Doran. In the confusion, one of Arianne's co-conspirators, the knight Gerold [...] "Darkstar" [...] Dayne, attempts to kill Myrcella; she survives <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> is scarred, and Ser Arys is killed. This strains the new Dornish alliance with House Lannister and the Iron Throne. To his daughter, Doran reveals that her brother Quentyn has gone east to bring back [...] "Fire and Blood".|$|E
60|$|She did {{not answer}} him, <b>but</b> kept <b>her</b> <b>face</b> buried in <b>her</b> hands.|$|R
60|$|She {{could say}} no more, <b>but</b> covered <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{with both hands}} and wept.|$|R
60|$|Beatrice {{looked up}} in surprise, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>face</b> was quietly thoughtful.|$|R
2500|$|The {{painting}} shows a half-length figure, {{the body}} of a woman turned at a three-quarter angle toward her right, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> turned toward her left. Her gaze is directed neither straight ahead, nor toward the viewer, but toward a [...] "third party" [...] beyond the picture's frame. In her arms, Gallerani holds a small white-coated stoat, known as an ermine. Gallerani's dress is comparatively simple, revealing that she is not a noblewoman. Her coiffure, known as a coazone, confines her hair smoothly to her head with two bands of hair bound {{on either side of her}} face and a long plait at the back. Her hair is held in place by a fine gauze veil with a woven border of gold-wound threads, a black band, and a sheath over the plait.|$|E
2500|$|Catherine also {{received}} Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun (formerly court painter to Marie Antoinette) at her Tsarskoye Selo residence in St Petersburg, by {{whom she was}} painted shortly before her death. Madame Vigée Le Brun vividly describes the empress in her memoirs: [...] "the sight of this famous woman so impressed me that I {{found it impossible to}} think of anything: I could only stare at her. Firstly I was very surprised at her small stature; I had imagined her to be very tall, as great as her fame. She was also very fat, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was still beautiful, and she wore her white hair up, framing it perfectly. Her genius seemed to rest on her forehead, which was both high and wide. Her eyes were soft and sensitive, her nose quite Greek, her colour high and her features expressive. She addressed me immediately in a voice full of sweetness, if a little throaty: [...] "I am delighted to welcome you here, Madame, your reputation runs before you. I am very fond of the arts, especially painting. I am no connoisseur, but I am a great art lover." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{held her}} unresisting hand, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was hidden from him.|$|E
60|$|Swanhild smiled also and, turning, went. <b>But</b> when <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{was hidden}} from him she smiled no more.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> {{presently}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> grew troubled, and {{he remembered}} the look {{she had given him}} at the depot.|$|R
60|$|Then Baleka said no more, <b>but,</b> turning <b>her</b> <b>face</b> to {{the wall}} of the hut, she wept and groaned bitterly.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> had {{suddenly}} gone grave, and apprehension brooded in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|She {{answered}} him lightly, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> softened {{and her eyes}} shone with sympathy.|$|E
60|$|Abijah {{was in the}} hall. She was tearless, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{was white}} and set.|$|E
60|$|She had met his {{brilliant}} eyes, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> clear <b>face</b> scarcely showed the elation which rose within her.|$|R
60|$|How Theodora hung {{upon the}} answer, her very throat aching with anxiety, <b>but</b> {{hardening}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> because John looked towards her.|$|R
60|$|I {{remained}} standing before her. She raised to me not <b>her</b> eyes <b>but</b> <b>her</b> whole <b>face,</b> inquisitively—perhaps in appeal.|$|R
60|$|The {{woman did}} not quail, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> seemed a ghastly yellow, {{seen through the}} falling snow.|$|E
60|$|The consul glanced {{quickly at}} the girl. <b>But</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> betrayed no consciousness, except of their present disappointment.|$|E
60|$|My father {{coughed and}} looked towards my stepmother, as though for guidance. <b>But</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was a blank.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am sure I {{knew that}} you were!' escaped from Phoebe, softly, <b>but</b> making <b>her</b> <b>face</b> burn, as at what she had not meant to say.|$|R
60|$|Betty {{thought a}} while. She could not doubt the evidence, <b>but</b> from <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{it was clear}} that she took no severe view of the offence.|$|R
60|$|She made {{an effort}} to alter <b>her</b> position, <b>but</b> failed: <b>her</b> <b>face</b> changed; she seemed to {{experience}} some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps, of the last pang.|$|R
60|$|Jacinta {{took the}} letter in a steady hand, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> grew a trifle blanched as she read.|$|E
60|$|Kate said nothing, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{showed that}} she was greatly pleased at her sister's change of tone.|$|E
60|$|She said no more, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{remained}} clouded. On the {{way down}} to the store they met Lincoln.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dick! What fun!" [...] She {{gave him}} both <b>her</b> hands, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> smiling <b>face</b> said very plainly, [...] "Oh; don't {{let us be}} sentimental!" ...|$|R
60|$|She did {{not look}} at Lewisham, <b>but</b> before <b>her,</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> a white misery.|$|R
60|$|He stooped down {{suddenly}} to <b>her</b> <b>face</b> to kiss <b>her,</b> <b>but</b> she turned <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{in time to}} receive the caress on the cheek.|$|R
60|$|Alice {{looked up}} in dismay; for this seemed {{equivalent}} to a dismissal. <b>But</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> expressed nothing but polite indifference.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Lecks {{had said}} very little during this startling communication, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> had assumed a stern and {{determined}} expression. Now she spoke: ...|$|E
60|$|He obeyed. A deeper {{seriousness}} {{crept into}} her tone, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was still soft and wonderful. The new things were lingering there.|$|E
6000|$|I cried: [...] "O darling, {{turn your}} head!" [...] <b>But</b> never <b>her</b> <b>face</b> I viewed; [...] "O turn, O turn!" [...] again I said, [...] And miserably pursued.|$|R
6000|$|... "But nought {{would she}} {{to do with}} he, [...] <b>But</b> turned <b>her</b> <b>face</b> away; [...] So gat he gone to far countrye, [...] And left that lady gay.|$|R
60|$|His {{youthful}} {{and attentive}} wife seemed to reflect; <b>but</b> raising <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> {{with an expression}} of content that could not be counterfeited, she shook her head in the negative.|$|R
