5|$|Mycena inclinata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, deriving its {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves, twigs, bark and branches. It accomplishes this by producing enzymes capable of <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> three major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.|$|E
5|$|Metagenomics {{can provide}} {{valuable}} {{insights into the}} functional ecology of environmental communities. Metagenomic analysis of the bacterial consortia found in the defecations of Australian sea lions suggests that nutrient-rich sea lion faeces {{may be an important}} nutrient source for coastal ecosystems. This is because the bacteria that are expelled simultaneously with the defecations are adept at <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> nutrients in the faeces into a bioavailable form that can be taken up into the food chain.|$|E
5|$|Typhula quisquiliaris fruit {{bodies are}} {{typically}} found in rows, growing from plant detritus. The species favours bracken, especially Pteridium aquilinum, but the colonisation of dead matter from other plants is not unknown. Upon these substrates, it feeds as a saprotroph, <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{dead organic matter}} in order to sustain itself. The species has been recorded in Europe and northern Africa. In Europe, the fruit bodies can be encountered from April to December.|$|E

50|$|Pretreatment: Pretreatment {{is a high}} temperature, short {{residence}} time, mild {{acid hydrolysis}} which <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> feedstock and prepares it for the introduction of enzymes. Pretreatment also <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hemicellulose component of the feedstock into five-carbon sugars. Pretreatment requires water, chemicals, and high pressure steam. Energy is recovered for re-use elsewhere in the process.|$|R

5|$|Sarcoscypha dudleyi is a {{saprobic}} species, and derives nutrients by <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> complex insoluble polysaccharides {{found in}} woody material, such as cellulose and lignin. Fruit bodies are found growing singly or in very small groups, and {{are attached to}} buried or partially buried sticks in forests. Basswood has been noted to be a preferred wood type for the species. Fruit bodies typically appear during early spring, but may occasionally also in late fall. Although the distribution appears to be largely restricted to the eastern United States, it was once reported in Bulgaria in 1994, representing the first European collection.|$|E
5|$|With the Soviet forces cut in half, {{the attack}} on the Karelian Isthmus could commence. The Finnish army {{attempted}} to encircle large Soviet formations at Sortavala and Hiitola by advancing to the western shores of Lake-Ladoga. By mid-August the encirclement succeeded and both towns were taken but many Soviet formations were able to evacuate by sea. Further west, {{the attack on}} Viborg was launched. With Soviet resistance <b>breaking</b> <b>down,</b> <b>the</b> Finns were able to encircle Vyborg by advancing to the Vuoksi River. The city itself was taken on 30 August, along with a broad advance {{on the rest of the}} Karelian Isthmus. By the beginning of September, Finland had restored its pre-winter war borders.|$|E
5|$|Desperate, they free Chris, who {{reveals that}} Claire is his sister, and the prison has an armored car {{they can use}} to escape. However, a giant axe-wielding monster begins <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> gate. Alice, Chris and Crystal go to the {{basement}} armory to get more guns; however, zombies kill Crystal en route. Luther and Claire reinforce the gate. Angel informs Bennett and Yong the car is missing its engine, {{and it would take}} a week to fix. Bennett shoots Angel and heads for Arcadia in Alice's airplane. The Axeman breaks down the gate, allowing the zombies into the prison. The group decides to use the zombie-dug tunnels to escape into the sewers. Kim Yong is slashed in half by the Axeman, while Alice is knocked out. Claire successfully defends Alice, manages to defeat the Axeman and disorienting it, after which Alice kills it by firing at its head. Unfortunately, Luther is dragged back into the tunnels by a zombie.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{rock and roll}} was faltering as its major stars dropped from public view. Elvis Presley was drafted, Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran died in 1959 and 1960 respectively, Chuck Berry was in jail, and Jerry Lee Lewis had been disgraced by press reports that he married his 13-year-old cousin. Music and culture critic Nelson George disagrees with music historians who attest {{the last two years}} of the 1950s were barren of talent, {{pointing}} to Charles and this song in particular. George writes that the themes in Charles' work were very similar to the young rebels who popularized rock and roll, writing By <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> division between pulpit and bandstand, recharging blues concerns with transcendental fervor, unashamedly linking the spiritual and the sexual, Charles made pleasure (physical satisfaction) and joy (divine enlightenment) seem the same thing. By doing so he brought the realities of the Saturday-night sinner and Sunday-morning worshipper—so often one and the same—into raucous harmony.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Las Vegas Strip {{shooting}} on the evening of October 1, 2017, approximately 300 people fleeing from the concert venue entered the airfield after <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> security fence surrounding McCarran while seeking shelter from the gunfire. Since they had entered an active airfield, airport officials suspended operations on 01L/19R and 01R/19L at 10:15p.m. local time, and then shut down 08L/26R and 08R/26L one hour later. Airfield operations resumed at 12:40a.m. on October 2, and the security fence was repaired by 1:10a.m. During the suspension of operations, 25 flights were diverted to other airports in the region, primarily to Phoenix but also to Los Angeles, Ontario, Bullhead City, Salt Lake City, and Denver. Two bullets struck and damaged, but did not ignite, a large fuel tank {{on the grounds of the}} airport.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundations}} of the Pax Mongolica lie in the Mongol Empire beginning with Genghis Khan in the early 13th century. In the process of conquering the various tribes in the region, Genghis Khan revolutionised the way Mongolian tribal society was structured. After each new victory, {{more and more people}} were incorporated under Genghis Khan's rule, thus diversifying the societal balance of the tribe. In 1203, Genghis Khan, in an effort to strengthen his army, ordered a reform that reorganised his army's structure while <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> traditional clan- and kindred-based divisions that had previously fragmented the society and military. He arranged his army into arbans (inter-ethnic groups of ten), and the members of an arban were commanded to be loyal to one another regardless of ethnic origin. Ten arbans made a zuun, or a company; ten zuuns made a myangan, or a battalion; and ten myangans formed a tumen, or an army of 10,000. This decimal system organisation of Genghis Khan's strong military would prove very effective in conquering, by persuasion or force, the many tribes of the central Asian steppe, but it would also strengthen Mongol society as a whole. By 1206 Genghis Khan's military expansion had unified the tribes of Mongolia, and in the same year he was elected and acclaimed as the leader of Mongolia.|$|E
