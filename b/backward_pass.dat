25|$|With {{both teams}} {{entering}} the game 5–5 {{and trying to}} become bowl-eligible, Carolina led 14–7 at the half in Clemson. Gamecock RB Brandon Bennett received the kick to start the third quarter, took a few steps, then turned and threw a <b>backward</b> <b>pass</b> {{to the other side}} of the field which was caught by DB Reggie Richardson who returned the ball 85 yards to the Tigers' 6-yard line. Bennett ran it in for a touchdown on the next play, putting Carolina ahead 21–7 and the Gamecocks never looked back, going on to win the game 33–7 and clinching a bid to the Carquest Bowl.|$|E

The Golden Bears used five lateral passes on the ensuing kickoff return to score the winning {{touchdown}} and earn a disputed 25–20 victory. Members of the Stanford Band came onto the field midway through the return, believing that the game was over, which added to the confusion and folklore.

2500|$|Sharpe {{was also}} a pioneer of college {{basketball}}. [...] Intercollegiate basketball did not gain traction until the 1900s, but Yale students organized a team in the 1890s. [...] In February 1898, Sharpe led Yale's basketball team to a 27–7 win over New York's Knickerbocker Athletic Club. [...] A newspaper account of the game praised Yale for its [...] "signal work" [...] in passing the ball {{from one to another}} without a hitch. [...] Sharpe led all scorers with five goals including a halfcourt shot described as follows:"In the second half Sharp wound up the good work of his team by throwing a goal from the centre of the field on a <b>backward</b> <b>pass</b> from Lockwood. [...] The ball sailed through the air and landed in the basket without touching anything. [...] This was an unusual feat." ...|$|E

50|$|One famous college play {{involving}} the <b>backward</b> <b>passes</b> is simply known as The Play. In the 1982 Big Game between Stanford and California, with four seconds left and trailing by one point, Cal ran {{the ball back}} on a kickoff all {{the way for the}} game-winning touchdown using five <b>backward</b> <b>passes,</b> eventually running through the Stanford Band, who had already taken the field (believing the game was over after Stanford players appeared to have tackled a Cal ball-carrier). The game remains controversial because of Stanford's contention that the Cal player's knee was down before he passed the ball during the third lateral and that the fifth lateral was an illegal forward pass.|$|R
5000|$|Fumbles {{can now be}} {{recovered}} and advanced by the defense anywhere on the field (previously it only applied to fumbles beyond the line of scrimmage), except for <b>backward</b> <b>passes</b> and muffed punts/kickoffs, which can {{be recovered}} by the defense but not advanced.|$|R
2500|$|Afterward, upon {{viewing the}} game footage, some {{suggested}} that the fifth lateral, from Mariet Ford to Kevin Moen, {{could have been an}} illegal forward pass. Ford was being tackled at about the 26-yard-line when he released his blind, over-the-shoulder heave, which Moen appeared to catch while crossing the 25. Because both players were in full stride, and because the lateral traveled some distance, some thought the ball had gone forward. [...] Under the rules of football, the direction of a pass is judged relative to the field. Complicating this was the fact that Ford was falling forward upon releasing the ball, while Moen reached backwards to catch it, thus making it quite possible that the ball itself traveled sideways or backward. However, to be a forward pass, the ball must actually travel forward; a ball that travels laterally only is a <b>backward</b> <b>pass</b> and in this situation, legal.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} quarter, a {{controversial}} blown call occurred when Houston QB Warren Moon attempted a <b>backward</b> <b>pass</b> {{at his own}} 7 yard line. [...] The pass ricocheted off the intended receiver and fell incomplete. Cleveland linebacker Clay Matthews recovered the assumed lateral at the Oiler's 5 yard line {{and went into the}} end zone for an apparent touchdown. [...] Instant replay clearly showed that Moon's pass had traveled backwards and the Browns either, should have been awarded a touchdown with Matthew's recovery and advance into the end zone, or given possession of the ball at the Oiler's 5 yard line. [...] However, Houston was inexplicably granted possession of the ball at the 5 yard line, due to an inadvertent whistle stopping play, the very spot where referees agreed that Clay Matthews had recovered the lateral for Cleveland. [...] Later on, Moon threw his third interception of the day, this one to Mark Harper, who returned it 17 yards with a facemask penalty against Alonzo Highsmith adding another 11. Cleveland took over on the Houston 11, and eventually scored on Pagel's 14-yard touchdown pass to Webster Slaughter that gave the Browns the lead, 16–14. However, the Oilers marched on a 76-yard drive in which Moon completed passes to Jamie Williams and Drew Hill for gains of 14 and 18 yards, while Pinkett had a 27-yard carry. Rookie running back Lorenzo White capped it off with a 1-yard touchdown run. After that, the Oilers stopped Cleveland on their next two drives, including Johnson's interception that set up Zendejas' 49-yard field goal, giving them a 24-16 lead with less than two minutes left in the game.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{well known}} play was {{executed}} {{in a college}} football game by Presbyterian against Wake Forest in 2010. In this trick play, three lateral pass rules were used in combination. First the quarterback passed the ball sideways while intentionally bouncing {{the ball on the}} ground (a so-called [...] "fake fumble pass"). The pass-receiver faked the end of the play, suggesting that it was an incomplete pass, but then passed the ball forward to a wide-receiver, who successfully ran for a touchdown. Wake Forest coach Jim Grobe described the play [...] "as well executed as anything I’ve ever seen". [...] In a Division III college football game on October 27, 2007, Trinity University was trailing by two points with two seconds left in a game against conference rival Millsaps College. Starting from their own 39-yard line, Trinity called a play for a short pass across the middle. The receiver pitched the ball backward, with a sequence of additional <b>backward</b> <b>passes</b> as players were in danger of being tackled. The [...] "Mississippi Miracle" [...] ultimately included 15 <b>backward</b> <b>passes</b> as it covered 61 yards for the winning touchdown.|$|R
2500|$|Hockey is an [...] "off-side" [...] game, {{meaning that}} forward passes are allowed, unlike in rugby. Before the 1930s hockey was an on-side game, meaning that only <b>backward</b> <b>passes</b> were allowed. Those rules favoured {{individual}} stick-handling {{as a key}} means of driving the puck forward. With the arrival of offside rules, the forward pass transformed hockey into a truly team sport, where individual performance diminished in importance relative to team play, which could now be coordinated over the entire surface of the ice as opposed to merely rearward players.|$|R

50|$|Passing is {{a common}} {{technique}} in sports that use balls and pucks. A pass consists of an intentional transfer of the ball from one player to another of the same team. Examples of sports that involve passing are association football, basketball, ice hockey, and American football. Certain games only allow <b>backward</b> <b>passing</b> (for example, rugby football), while others allow both. Of those that allow forward passing, some prohibit the receiver from being ahead of the pass {{at a certain point}} on the field (e.g., the offside rule in ice hockey), while other do not (e.g., American football).|$|R
5000|$|In the {{modified}} version of the A-11 developed after 2009, the center is flanked by ineligible numbered [...] "anchors", basically creating a 3-man offensive line.

Two other players spread out along the line of scrimmage must also wear numbers that automatically make them ineligible.|$|R
