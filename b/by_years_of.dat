5|$|Alexander's 10-year {{campaign}} in Asia, and the Macedonian {{conquest of the}} Persian empire, were to become the stuff of legend. The Macedonian army campaigned in Asia Minor, the Levant, Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia and Persia, winning notable battles at the Granicus, the Issus and Gaugamela, before the final collapse of Darius's rule in 330 BC. Alexander thus became ruler of the extensive Persian domains, although his rule {{over most of the}} territory was far from secure. Alexander continued campaigning in central Asia in the following years, before crossing into the Indian sub-continent. However, the Macedonian army became increasingly unhappy, and eventually mutinied, forcing Alexander to turn back. Alexander spent his final years attempting to consolidate his empire and planning future campaigns but, probably exhausted <b>by</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> hard campaigning, he died in Babylon in 323 BC.|$|E
5|$|Despite early victories, Pyrrhus {{found his}} {{position}} in Italy untenable. Rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with Pyrrhus {{as long as his}} army remained in Italy. Facing unacceptably heavy losses from each encounter with the Roman army, Pyrrhus withdrew from the peninsula. In 275 BC, Pyrrhus again met the Roman army at the Battle of Beneventum. While Beneventum was indecisive, Pyrrhus realised his army had been exhausted and reduced <b>by</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> foreign campaigns. Seeing little hope for further gains, he withdrew completely from Italy.|$|E

5|$|East of Porus' kingdom, {{near the}} Ganges River, were the Nanda Empire of Magadha and further east the Gangaridai Empire (of the modern-day Bengal {{region of the}} Indian subcontinent). Fearing the {{prospect}} of facing other large armies and exhausted <b>by</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> campaigning, Alexander's army mutinied at the Hyphasis River (Beas), refusing to march farther east. This river thus marks the easternmost extent of Alexander's conquests.|$|E

5|$|Heraclius's {{defeat of}} the Persians ended a war that {{had been going on}} {{intermittently}} for almost 400 years and led to instability in the Persian Empire. Kavadh II died only months after assuming the throne, plunging Persia into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war. Ardashir III, Heraclius's ally Shahrbaraz, and Khosrau's daughters Purandokht and Azarmidokht all succeeded to the throne within months of each other. Only when Yazdgerd III, a grandson of Khosrau II, succeeded to the throne in 632 was there stability. But by then the Sasanid Empire was severely disorganised and had been severely weakened <b>by</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> war and civil strife over the succession to the throne.|$|E

5|$|The French {{defenders}} of the island were weakened <b>by</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> isolation caused by the British blockade. Although the available French troops numbered between 3,000 and 4,000, there was an epidemic {{on the island and}} a significant proportion of the garrison, principally formed by the 66e Régiment, were unfit for duty. Apart from the capital, the rest of the island's defences were manned by a militia formed from local inhabitants, among whom morale was low and desertion rates high. Military and food stores of all kinds were in short supply and the governor, General Jean Augustin Ernouf was unable to maintain garrisons around the island's extensive perimeter.|$|E

5|$|When his Sicilian {{campaign}} was also ultimately a failure, {{and at the}} request of his Italian allies, Pyrrhus returned to Italy to face Rome once more. In 275 BC, Pyrrhus again met the Roman army at the Battle of Beneventum. This time the Romans had devised methods to deal with the war elephants, including the use of javelins, fire and, one source claims, simply hitting the elephants heavily on the head. While Beneventum was indecisive, Pyrrhus realised that his army had been exhausted and reduced <b>by</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> foreign campaigns, and seeing little hope for further gains, he withdrew completely from Italy.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{seriousness}} of this loss, it was in Asia Minor that the empire's greatest disaster would take place. The Seljuk Turks, although mainly concerned with defeating Egypt under the Fatimids, nevertheless {{conducted a series of}} damaging raids into Armenia and eastern Anatolia– the main recruiting ground for Byzantine armies. With imperial armies weakened <b>by</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> insufficient funding and civil warfare, Emperor Romanos Diogenes realised that a time of re-structuring and re-equipment was necessary. Consequently, he attempted to lead a defensive campaign in the east until his forces had recovered enough to defeat the Seljuks. However, he suffered a surprise defeat at the hands of Alp Arslan (Sultan of the Seljuk Turks) at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. Romanos was captured, and although the Sultan's peace terms were fairly lenient, the battle in the long term resulted in the total loss of Byzantine Anatolia.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Gaozong and the {{emergence}} of the Mongols, the Song dynasty formed a military alliance with the Mongols in the hope of finally defeating the Jin dynasty. Several tens of thousands of carts full of grain were sent to the Mongol army during the siege. Following the destruction of the Jurchens in 1234, the Southern Song generals broke the alliance, proceeding to recapture the three historical capitals of Kaifeng, Luoyang and Chang'an. However, the cities, ravaged <b>by</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> warfare, lacked economic capacity and yielded little defensibility. This breaking of alliance meant open warfare between the Mongols and the Song Chinese. Ögodei Khan's forces conquered fifty-four out of Sichuan's fifty-eight total districts by 1236, while ordering the slaughter of over a million people that inhabited the city of Chengdu, which was taken by the Mongols with ease.|$|E
5|$|Justinian's {{ambition}} {{to restore the}} Roman Empire to its former glory was only partly realized. In the West, the brilliant early military successes of the 530s were followed <b>by</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> stagnation. The dragging war with the Goths was a disaster for Italy, even though its long-lasting effects may have been less severe than is sometimes thought. The heavy taxes that the administration imposed upon its population were deeply resented. The final victory in Italy and the conquest of Africa and the coast of southern Hispania significantly enlarged the area over which the Empire could project its power and eliminated all naval threats to the empire. Despite losing much of Italy soon after Justinian's death, the empire retained several important cities, including Rome, Naples, and Ravenna, leaving the Lombards as a regional threat. The newly founded province of Spania kept the Visigoths {{as a threat to}} Hispania alone and not to the western Mediterranean and Africa.|$|E

5|$|The RPF advance {{continued}} unchecked through February, {{its forces}} moving steadily south and gaining territory without opposition. They took Ruhengeri {{on the first}} day of fighting, and later the city of Byumba. As with the previous RPF advances, the Hutu civilians in the area fled en masse from the areas the RPF were taking, travelling back into the government-controlled territory. These exoduses were likely driven primarily by the fear of the RPF established <b>by</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> propaganda, although the RPF soldiers were guilty in some areas of small scale killing of Hutu civilians. Prunier attributes this to a combination of retribution for the massacre of Tutsi perpetrated in these areas in late January, as well as some indiscriminate killing. This RPF violence increased the fear felt by the Hutu population, but also served to further alienate the rebels from their potential allies in the democratic Rwandan opposition parties.|$|E
5|$|The cabinet settled upon a risky {{alternative}} {{to resolve the}} complicated situation in the Platine region. Instead of undertaking a period of conscription {{to build up the}} Brazilian Army, which would have been costly, the Council decided to rely on the standing army. It sent a contingent south to secure the region. Brazil held an advantage in possessing a powerful and modern navy, along with an experienced professional army hardened <b>by</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> internal and external warfare. Up until this point, no other nation in South America possessed true navies or regular armies. Rosas' and Oribe's forces were largely made up of irregular troops on loan from those caudillos who supported them. Even a decade later, Argentina could only field an army of 6,000 men. Brazil also decided to adopt Rosas' own tactics by financing his opponents to weaken him both internally and externally.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} scientific literature on chess psychology. Alfred Binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal, rather than visuospatial, ability {{lies at the}} core of expertise. In his doctoral thesis, Adriaan de Groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position. According to de Groot, this perception, made possible <b>by</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> practice and study, {{is more important than the}} sheer ability to anticipate moves. De Groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly. The ability to memorize does not alone account for chess-playing skill, since masters and novices, when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces, had equivalent recall (about half a dozen positions in each case). Rather, it is the ability to recognize patterns, which are then memorized, which distinguished the skilled players from the novices. When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game, the masters had almost total positional recall.|$|E

5|$|Until the mid-19thcentury {{duck rearing}} was {{concentrated}} on the Duck End, but by the 1860s it had spread to many other towns and villages in the area, particularly Weston Turville and Haddenham. Contamination of Aylesbury's soil <b>by</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> duck rearing, and new public health legislation which ended many traditional practices, caused {{the decline of the}} duck rearing industry in the Duck End, and by the 1890s the majority of Aylesbury ducks were raised in the villages rather than the town itself. Population shifts and the improved national rail network reduced the need to rear ducks near London, and large duck farms opened in Lancashire, Norfolk and Lincolnshire. Although the number of ducks raised nationwide continued to grow, between 1890 and 1900 the number of ducks raised in the Aylesbury area remained static, and from 1900 it began to drop.|$|E
