40|$|Birt-Hogg-Dubé {{syndrome}} (BHD) (OMIM: # 135150) {{is a rare}} genodermatosis {{following a}} dominant pattern of inheritance. The heritable genetic cause of BHD has been determined as mutations within the gene Folliculin (FLCN). A variable phenotype has been observed in systems modelling loss of function of FLCN, this study therefore intends to take a novel approach to mutational studies by utilising the zebrafish model organism. We exploit the optical benefits of the zebrafish model using imaging analysis of a Fucci transgenic line and in situ hybridisation {{and are able to}} suggest a possible functional role of FLCN within cell cycle regulation and morphogenesis in the developing brain. Platelet <b>based</b> <b>bleeding</b> disorders are a rare subset of bleeding diathesis that can incorporate thrombocytopenias and platelet function defects. Both thrombocytopenias and platelet function defects present clinically with symptoms relating to hypocoagulability that often manifest as a variation of bleeding episodes. To date there is a large collection of inherited platelet <b>based</b> <b>bleeding</b> disorders incorporating a spectrum of genes with an elucidated role in platelet development or function. This study aims to progress work in this field by using a whole exome sequencing approach following the Genotyping and Platelet Phenotyping (GAPP) protocol. We focus our efforts on two patients families and determine novel candidate variations as potentially disease causing. These candidate variations offer a starting point for subsequent research which can help produce a novel diagnosis and determine new genes with an involvement in platelet functioning and development. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of the {{analytical}} and numerical studies of the plume interaction with the base flow in the presence of base out-gassing. The physics-based analysis and CFD modeling of the base heating for single solid rocket motor performed in this research addressed the following questions: what are the key factors making base flow so different from that in the Shuttle [1]; why CFD analysis of this problem reveals small plume recirculation; what major factors influence base temperature; and why overheating was initiated at a given time in the flight. To answer these questions topological analysis of the base flow was performed and Korst theory was used to estimate relative contributions of radiation, plume recirculation, and chemically reactive out-gassing to the base heating. It was shown that <b>base</b> <b>bleeding</b> and small <b>base</b> volume are the key factors contributing to the overheating, while plume recirculation is effectively suppressed by asymmetric configuration of the flow formed earlier in the flight. These findings are further verified using CFD simulations that include multi-species gas environment both in the plume and in the base. Solid particles in the exhaust plume (Al 2 O 3) and char particles in the <b>base</b> <b>bleeding</b> were also included into the simulations and their relative contributions into the base temperature rise were estimated.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{contributors}} to the aerodynamic drag of a heavy vehicle is tractor-trailer gap drag, which arises when the vehicle operates within a crosswind. Under this operating condition, freestream flow is entrained into the tractor-trailer gap, imparting a momentum exchange to the vehicle and subsequently increasing the aerodynamic drag. While a number of add-on devices, including side extenders, splitter plates, vortex stabilizers, and gap sealers, have been previously tested to alleviate this source of drag, side extenders remain the primary add-on device of choice for reducing tractor-trailer gap drag. However, side extenders are not without maintenance and operational issues. When a heavy vehicle pivots sharply {{with respect to the}} trailer, as can occur during loading or unloading operations, the side extenders can become crushed against the trailer. Consequently, fleet operators are forced to incur additional costs to cover the repair or replacement of the damaged side extenders. This issue can be overcome by either shortening the side extenders or by devising an alternative drag reduction concept that can perform just as effectively as side extenders. To explore such a concept, we investigate tractor <b>base</b> <b>bleeding</b> as a means of reducing gap drag. Wind tunnel measurements are made on a 1 : 20 scale heavy vehicle model at a vehicle width-based Reynolds number of 420, 000. The tractor bleeding flow, which is delivered through a porous material embedded within the tractor base, is introduced into the tractor-trailer gap at bleeding coefficients ranging from 0. 0 - 0. 018. To determine the performance of tractor <b>base</b> <b>bleeding</b> under more realistic operating conditions, computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed on a full-scale heavy vehicle within a crosswind for bleeding coefficients ranging from 0. 0 - 0. 13...|$|R

40|$|Along with {{haemophilia}} A and B, von Willebrand disease (VWD) {{and rare}} bleeding disorders (RBDs) cover all inherited bleeding disorders of coagulation. Bleeding tendency, which {{can range from}} extremely severe to mild, is the common symptom. VWD, due to a deficiency and/or abnormality of von Willebrand factor (VWF), represents the most frequent bleeding disorder, mostly inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. The diagnosis may be difficult, <b>based</b> on a <b>bleeding</b> history and different diagnostic assays, which evaluate the pleiotropic functions of VWF. Different treatment options are available for optimal management of bleeding and their prevention, and long-term outcomes are generally good.

The prevalence of the severe forms can range from 1 case in 500, 000 up to 1 in 2 – 3 million, according to the defect. Diagnosis is <b>based</b> on <b>bleeding</b> history, coagulation screening tests and specific factor assays.

40|$|The {{rarity of}} severe {{complications}} {{of this disease}} in children makes randomized clinical trials in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) unfeasible. Therefore, the current management recommendations for ITP are largely dependent on clinical expertise and observations. As part of its discussions during the Intercontinental Cooperative ITP Study Group Expert Meeting in Basel, the Management working group recommended {{that the decision to}} treat an ITP patient be individualized and <b>based</b> mainly on <b>bleeding</b> symptoms and not on the actual platelet count number and should be supported by bleeding scores using a validated assessment tool.

Given the apparently high recurrence rate to rituximab therapy in children and the drug's possible toxicity, the group felt that until more data are available, a conservative approach may be considered, reserving rituximab for patients who failed splenectomy. More studies of the effectiveness and side effects of drugs to treat refractory patients, such as TPO mimetics, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and cytotoxic agents are required, as are long-term data on post-splenectomy complications.
