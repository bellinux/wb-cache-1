25|$|In an {{incredible}} finish to the knock-out quarter-final between Surrey Lions and Warwickshire Bears, the match was tied, so the players had {{to resort to}} a bowl-off - cricket's version of a penalty shootout, in which five players have two attempts at bowling at unguarded stumps, and if the stumps fall down, that was one point for their team. Surrey opened the batting in this match at The Oval, having been put in to bat by the Bears' captain Nick Knight. It was a shaky effort, often interrupted by wickets, and part-timer Jonathan Trott snared two wickets for 19 - admittedly tail-enders Ian Salisbury and Tim Murtagh. Mark Ramprakash, however, hit an unbeaten run-a-ball 34 to guide Surrey to 149 for 8, well <b>below</b> a <b>par</b> score. Warwickshire's innings then began under heavy cloud cover that assisted the Surrey swing bowlers. After Neil Carter went first ball, Warwickshire struggled in the rain, and the bad weather eventually stopped play just before five overs was played - so that, if the players couldn't return, the match would be declared a no-result. However, the rain gave way reasonably quickly, and quick hitting from Trevor Penney in particular - who made 20 off 12 balls before being caught off a ball from Rikki Clarke closed down the deficit.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, trellis shaping (TS) {{is applied}} to dynamic range control of band-limited single-carrier {{high-order}} quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signals. With a newly designed shaping metric, we show that a signal with very low peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) can be achieved without significant loss of data rate. A specific example demonstrates that a band-limited transmission with spectral efficiency of 4. 55 bit/sec/Hz (including the redundancy due to the shaping) and <b>PAR</b> <b>below</b> 3 dB is achievable using a square 64 -ary QAM constellation and a root raised-cosine filter with a roll-off factor 0. 1.

25|$|The main number {{which is}} used to assess the value of the bond is the gross {{redemption}} yield. This is defined such that if all future interest and principal repayments are discounted back to the present, at an interest rate equal to the gross redemption yield (gross means pre-tax), then the discounted value is equal to the current market price of the bond (or the initial issue price if the bond is just being launched). Fixed income investments such as bonds and loans are generally priced as a credit spread above a low-risk reference rate, such as LIBOR or U.S. or German Government Bonds of the same duration. For example, if a 30-year mortgage denominated in US dollars has a gross redemption yield of 5% per annum and 30 year US Treasury Bonds have a gross redemption yield of 3% per annum (referred to as the risk free yield), the credit spread is 2% per annum (sometimes quoted as 200 basis points). The credit spread reflects the risk of default. Risk free interest rates are determined by market forces and vary over time, based on a variety of factors, such as current short-term interest rates, e.g. base rates set by central banks such as the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England in the UK, and the Euro Zone ECB. If the coupon on the bond is lower than the yield, then its price will be <b>below</b> the <b>par</b> value, and vice versa.|$|R

Power-line communication (PLC) carries {{data on a}} conductor that is also used simultaneously for AC electric power transmission or electric power distribution to consumers. In this context, device language message specification/companion specification for energy metering (DLMS/COSEM) is an increasingly popular standardized application protocol for communication between utilities and their customers. With this study we have implemented the PLC communication using Phase Shift Keying technique which helps in two way communication. Power line intelligent metering evolution (PRIME) is used to send DLMS/COSEM messages. We can easily control the power delivered to the client from the EB station. It makes simple by making PREPAID EB CARDS, So that only limited usage is Permitted, no extra or billing issues will exist. We use an IR reader to sense from the rechargeable cards, and it updates the value to the Client meter {{as well as the}} EB SECTION. As the client consumes power, the meter rotates and the recharged amount gets reduced as per the reading. This will be updated at the EB section immediately. When the amount goes <b>below</b> a <b>par</b> value, it intimates the user. We communicate between the client and the EB section through the power lines. As power line cables are present in all corners of India, we can easily monitor the EB through smart metering. Drawbacks such as high bit error rate, difficulty in monitoring has been overcome in the hardware implementation. Energy theft involved in the power line can be effectively controlled and identified through this technique. If implemented, this project can reduce the theft involved in power transmission by which it enhances the power line carrier communication...|$|R

We investigated the diurnal photosynthetic behaviour of the economically significant red alga Gracilaria lemaneiformis in the absence or presence of UV-A+B or UV-B with a flow-through system. While UV-A and UV-B, respectively, inhibited noontime Pmax by 22 % and 14 % on the sunny days, UV-A during sunrise (<b>PAR</b> <b>below</b> about 50 Wm- 2) increased the net photosynthesis by about 8 % when compared with PAR alone.

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the extent to which water use efficiency (WUE) at leaf scale can be used to assess WUE at canopy scale, leaf WUE being assumed to be a constant function of vapor pressure deficit and to thus not be dependent upon other environmental factors or varying leaf properties. Leaf WUE and its variability and dependencies were assessed using leaf gas-exchange measurements obtained during two growing seasons, 1999 and 2000, at the Soroe beech forest study site on Zealand in Denmark. It was found that the VPD-normalized leaf VVUE, WUEnormleaf, although dependent on incoming <b>PAR</b> <b>below</b> 500 p,mol m(- 2) s(- 1) is independent, both of the canopy levels and of variations in the environmental parameters. The average WUEnormleaf for PAR above 500 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1) was found to be 5. 5 mu mol CO 2 (mmol H 2 O) (- 1) hPa and, for the full range, 2. 3 mu mol CO 2 (mmol H 2 O) (- 1) hPa. These results showed that WUE can be up-scaled from leaf to canopy on the basis of WUEnormleaf and the PAR distribution within the canopy. The up-scaling conducted was based on this WUEnormleaf - PAR relationship, the light distribution being assessed using the MAESTRA model, parameterized in accordance with measurements obtained for the Soroe forest. The up-scaled WUE was then compared with WUE as estimated from turbulent flux data measured above the forest with the eddy-covariance technique. The modeled daily canopy WUE obtained for daytime fluxes (6 : 00 AM- 6 : 00 PM) was found to be in agreement with corresponding canopy WUE estimates based on the turbulent fluxes observed and to be dependent on VDP and light intensity alone, its thus being independent of other environmental factors. Accordingly, canopy WUE can be estimated on the basis of the up-scaled WUE relationships, provided incident PAR and VPD within the canopy are known...|$|R

Conditions are rather constant with 24 °C, 100 % rel. hum. and <b>PAR</b> <b>below</b> 100 μmol photons m- 2 sec- 1 at the lowland station, rather versatile in the mountains with six times higher daily sums of PAR, temperatures between 10 and 25 °C and relative humidities between 60 and 1 oo %. In the bamboo forest epiphytic mosses dry out during the day to less than 70 % of their water content, but regain saturation from the vapor-saturated air during night. Bryophyte photosynthesis and respiration were studied by Warburg manometry with moisture saturated samples. Temperature curves of gas exchange peaked between 22 and 30 °C. Optima of the lowland species were somewhat higher than those from samples collected at the mountain sites. Habitat separation of characteristics of photosynthesis was more pronounced with respect to light responses. Saturation gas exchange rates were reached by all species still below 400 μmol photons m- 2 sec- 1. But {{the slopes of the}} curves in the low-light range were distinctly steeper, and the light compensation points smaller in the lowland than in the highland species (compensation points of the former: 3 - 12 μmol photons m- 2 sec- 1, of the latter: 8 - 20 μmol photons m- 2 sec- 1). It is emphasized that bryophytes in the rainforest understory experience extremely high ambient C 02 concentrations near the floor. This, their low light requirements for photosynthesis, and the permanently optimal temperature and humidity conditions for maximal carbon gain enable them to live successfully, but with less biomass development in this dark and damp environment. By contrast, bryophytes from the bamboo forest and tree-heath environments can utilize light conditions combined with variable temperatures and humidities similarly as species from extratropical vegetation types...|$|R
