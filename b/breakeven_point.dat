40|$|The {{patchwork}} of laws designed to control air pollution from U. S. power plants {{has been criticized}} {{from a variety of}} different perspectives. Business groups argue that the laws are too complex and burdensome to industry. Environmentalists maintain that power plant emissions need to be further reduced because of their negative health effects, to combat global warming and to eliminate haze in our national parks. Economists claim that large emission reductions could be achieved rather cheaply by focusing control efforts on the decades-old power plants in the Midwest, but Midwesterners and their political representatives are understandably resistant to having to shoulder the costs. This paper describes an economic mechanism that has been used in Sweden since 1990 to control NOx emissions and indicates how, if it were modified and expanded to include other pollutants, could be made to work much like multi-pollutant cap-and-trade — but with more flexibility and efficiency. In this feebate system, each power plant would either pay a fee or collect a rebate for each ton of emissions above, or below, their assigned "breakeven point". With the per-ton fee/rebate rate set high enough to bring the needed emission reductions and <b>breakeven</b> <b>points</b> adjusted each year so that total rebates equaled total fees, the resulting system would work like a frictionless cap-and-trade: companies having high control costs would pay fees into the system, in effect paying companies with low control costs to do some of their controlling for them. At the same time, the system would bring control costs at Midwestern plants into line with those of other plants throughout the country and would also (through the assignment of <b>breakeven</b> <b>points)</b> provide a wide range of choices of how the additional control costs could be distributed.

40|$|The {{handling}} qualities of an aircraft {{have always been}} a crucial field of study, being chiefly concerned with the safety and comfort of flight. Historically, the design-by-discipline approach has been used, thus relegating stability and control considerations to later stages of the design process. In recent years a new view emerged, which advocates the benefits of including {{handling qualities}} at earlier stages, such as conceptual and preliminary. The objective of the research is to develop a handling qualities optimization module to be fitted in the Initiator, a conceptual design tool developed at TU Delft. The module shall handle both unaugmented designs (bare airframe), as well as augmented design, in which a suitable stability augmentation system (SAS) is included. To this end, a common stability paradigm, based on a modified Routh-Hurwitz criterion, has been implemented as a set of nonlinear constraints on the design space. In essence, the criterion has been transformed from a test to a design procedure, taking the form of a general polynomial-based regional pole placement method. The methodology is concerned with conventional aircraft configurations, specifically by sizing the horizontal tailplane and positioning of the wing. Themodule is focused on designs that possess optimal short period damping ratio and Control Anticipation Parameter (CAP), while the objective functions to be minimized are tailplane induced drag, zero-lift drag, and weight. Static stability and controllability are ensured in the relevant flight regimes using Torenbeek’s X-plots, implemented in the form of additional constraints on the design space. Lastly, the stability augmentation system consists of a pitch damper and an angle of attack feedback. Two different methods have been investigated for the computation of the feedback gains: the first one entails the inclusion of such gains in the design vector. The second one makes use of an optimal control technique: the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), augmenting the design vector with three required weighting factors. Hence, the module accepts three user inputs which specify the methodology: unaugmented design, augmented with method 1 (gains in the design vector) and augmented with method 2 (LQR). The optimization has been run for the three different user-specified methods on an Airbus A 320 - 200. The results show that the procedure is successful, increasing the CAP by 100 % for the unaugmented and augmented (method 1) designs. By using the LQR, the CAP showed an increase in 150 %. Moreover the unaugmented design achieved the required short period damping of 0. 55, or a 34 % increase with respect to the baseline value, while the augmented designs were capable of achieving a damping ratio of 0. 76, which corresponds to an increase of 85 %. A convergence study has been done within the Initiator, to assess the performance of the optimized configurations concerning aerodynamic efficiency (L/Dmax) and maximum takeoff mass (MTOM). The investigation led to the definition of <b>breakeven</b> <b>points,</b> which are used to indicate the values of short period damping ratio for which, at a given CAP, the optimized designs have the same performance as the baseline aircraft. Two general design guidelines have been extrapolated: for unaugmented designs, the <b>breakeven</b> <b>points</b> move closer to the baseline values as the CAP increases. Furthermore, at the baseline short period damping ratio and CAP, the optimized configuration is more efficient. For augmented designs, it was revealed that the performance benefits achievable are substantially higher and independent of the required handling qualities. Hence, no <b>breakeven</b> <b>points</b> can be defined. Optimal values of L/Dmax andMTOMare achieved right from the baseline values of damping and CAP, while the gains are progressively increased to cope with the handling qualities demands. Due to the qualitative nature of these conclusions, it is deemed possible to extend them to other conventional configurations, thus providing general design guidelines.

Of them, text categorization aims at developing a classification system for assigning a number of predefined topic codes to the documents based on the knowledge accumulated in the training process. We propose a framework based on an automatic inductive classifier, called ILA, for text categorization, though this attempt is not a novel approach to the information retrieval community. Our motivation are two folds. One is that there is still much to do for efficient and effective classifiers. The second is of ILA’s (Inductive Learning Algorithm) well-known ability in capturing by canonical rules the distinctive features of text categories. Our results with respect to the Reuters 21578 corpus indicate (1) the reduction of features by information gain measurement down to 20 is essentially as good as the case where one would have more features; (2) recall/precision <b>breakeven</b> <b>points</b> of our algorithm without tuning over top 10 categories are comparable to other text categorization methods, namely similarity based matching, naive Bayes, Bayes nets, decision trees, linear support vector machines, steepest descent algorithm...|$|R
