25|$|There are {{two major}} groups of TCAs in terms of {{chemical}} structure, which most, but not all, TCAs fall into. The groupings {{are based on the}} tricyclic ring system. They are the dibenzazepines (imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, lofepramine) and the dibenzocycloheptadienes (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, <b>butriptyline).</b> Minor TCA groups based on ring system include the dibenzoxepins (doxepin), the dibenzothiepines (dosulepin), and the dibenzoxazepines (amoxapine). In addition to classification based on the ring system, TCAs can also be usefully grouped {{based on the number of}} substitutions of the side chain amine. These groups include the tertiary amines (imipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, amitriptyline, <b>butriptyline,</b> doxepin, dosulepin) and the secondary amines (desipramine, nortriptyline, protriptyline). Lofepramine is technically a tertiary amine, but acts largely as a prodrug of desipramine, a secondary amine, and hence is more similar in profile to the secondary amines than to the tertiary amines. Amoxapine does not have the TCA side chain and hence is neither a tertiary nor secondary amine, although it is often grouped with the secondary amines due to sharing more in common with them.|$|E
25|$|Iprindole is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a cyclooctaindole (that is, an indole nucleus {{joined with}} a cyclooctyl ring), and possesses three rings fused {{together with a}} side chain attached in its chemical structure. It is a tertiary amine TCA, although its ring system and pharmacological properties {{are very different from}} those of other TCAs. Other tertiary amine TCAs that are similar to iprindole include <b>butriptyline</b> and trimipramine. The chemical name of iprindole is 3-(6,7,8,9,10,11-hexahydro-5H-cyclooctaindol-5-yl)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H28N2 with a molecular weight of 284.439g/mol. The drug has been used commercially as both the free base and the hydrochloride salt. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 5560-72-5 and of the hydrochloride is 20432-64-8.|$|E
25|$|Amitriptyline is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzocycloheptadiene, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzocycloheptadiene TCAs include nortriptyline (noramitriptyline, N-desmethylamitriptyline), protriptyline, and <b>butriptyline.</b> Amitriptyline is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite nortriptyline being a secondary amine.

The chemical name of amitriptyline is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzocycloheptene-5-ylidene)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C20H23N with a molecular weight of 277.403g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the free base form is used rarely and the embonate (pamoate) salt is used for intramuscular administration.

5000|$|Another {{study found}} Ki values for <b>butriptyline</b> of 4,300 nM for the , 990 nM for the , and 2,800 nM for the [...] in rat brain synaptosomes, {{suggesting}} only very weak inhibition of monoamine reuptake. A study that assessed IC50 values for <b>butriptyline</b> found 10.0 μM for serotonin reuptake, 1.7 μM for norepinephrine reuptake, and 5.2 nM for dopamine reuptake.|$|E
50|$|<b>Butriptyline</b> {{has been}} marketed under the brand names Evadene, Evadyne, Evasidol, and Centrolese.|$|E

5000|$|Tricyclic {{antidepressants}} (TCAs): amitriptyline, <b>butriptyline,</b> clomipramine, desipramine, dosulepin, doxepin, imipramine, lofepramine, nortriptyline, protriptyline, trimipramine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Butriptyline</b> {{has been}} marketed in Europe, {{including}} in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, and Italy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Butriptyline</b> was {{developed}} by Wyeth and introduced in the United Kingdom in either 1974 or 1975.|$|E
50|$|<b>Butriptyline</b> {{was used}} in the {{treatment}} of depression. It was usually used at dosages of 150-300 mg/day.|$|E
50|$|However, {{in small}} {{clinical}} trials, using similar doses, <b>butriptyline</b> {{was found to}} be slightly more effective than amitriptyline and imipramine as an antidepressant, despite the fact that both of these TCAs are far stronger as both 5-HT2 antagonists and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. As a result, it may be that <b>butriptyline</b> has a different mechanism of action, or perhaps functions as a prodrug in the body to a metabolite with different pharmacodynamics.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Butriptyline</b> is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzocycloheptadiene, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure.

50|$|Various {{tricyclic}} antidepressants (TCAs) {{contain the}} dibenzocycloheptene moiety in their chemical structures, including amineptine, amitriptyline, amitriptylinoxide, <b>butriptyline,</b> demexiptiline, nortriptyline, noxiptiline, and protriptyline. Cyclobenzaprine, a skeletal muscle relaxant, also contains this functional group.|$|E
50|$|<b>Butriptyline</b> {{is closely}} related to amitriptyline, and {{produces}} similar effects as other TCAs, but its side effects like sedation are said to be reduced in severity and it has a lower risk of interactions with other medications.|$|E
50|$|In vitro, <b>butriptyline</b> is {{a strong}} {{antihistamine}} and anticholinergic, moderate 5-HT2 and α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, and very weak or negligible monoamine reuptake inhibitor. These actions appear to confer a profile {{similar to that of}} iprindole and trimipramine with serotonin-blocking effects as the apparent predominant mediator of mood-lifting efficacy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Butriptyline</b> has potent {{antihistamine}} effects, {{resulting in}} sedation and somnolence. It also has potent anticholinergic effects, resulting in side effects like dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision, and cognitive/memory impairment. The drug has relatively weak effects as an alpha-1 blocker {{and has no}} effects as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, so is associated with little to no antiadrenergic and adrenergic side effects.|$|E
