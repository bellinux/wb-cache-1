The Mary Rogers was hove to {{at the time he}} gave the evidence, and, to clinch it, inside half an hour the Mary Rogers was hove down to the hatches. Her new main-topsail and brand new spencer were blown away like tissue paper; and five sails, furled and fast under double gaskets, were <b>blown</b> <b>loose</b> and {{stripped}} from the yards. And before morning the Mary Rogers was hove down twice again, and holes were knocked in her bulwarks to ease her decks from the weight of ocean that pressed her down.|$|E
60|$|It was on Sunday {{week in the}} evening, when he {{was lying}} in the orchard {{listening}} to a blackbird and composing a love poem, that he heard the gate swing to, and saw the girl come running among the trees, with the red-cheeked, stolid Joe in swift pursuit. About twenty yards away the chase ended, and the two stood fronting each other, not noticing the stranger in the grass--the boy pressing on, the girl fending him off. Ashurst could see her face, angry, disturbed; and the youth's--who {{would have thought that}} red-faced yokel could look so distraught! And painfully affected by that sight, he jumped up. They saw him then. Megan dropped her hands, and shrank behind a tree trunk; the boy gave an angry grunt, rushed at the bank, scrambled over and vanished. Ashurst went slowly up to her. She was standing quite still, biting her lip-very pretty, with her fine, dark hair <b>blown</b> <b>loose</b> about her face, and her eyes cast down.|$|E
50|$|A {{dust storm}} is a {{meteorological}} phenomenon common in arid and semi-arid regions. Dust storms arise when a gust front or other strong wind <b>blows</b> <b>loose</b> sand and dirt from a dry surface. Fine particles are transported by saltation and suspension, {{a process that}} moves soil from one place and deposits it in another.|$|R

'How lovely {{it is to}} be free,' said Ursula, running swiftly {{here and}} there between the tree trunks, quite naked, her hair <b>blowing</b> <b>loose.</b> The grove was of beech-trees, big and splendid, a steel-grey {{scaffolding}} of trunks and boughs, with level sprays of strong green here and there, whilst through the northern side the distance glimmered open as through a window.|$|R
50|$|Though the {{avalanche}} danger {{was listed as}} moderate {{on the day of}} {{the avalanche}} by the Bridger-Teton Avalanche center, the risk of a slide was increased by wind <b>blowing</b> <b>loose</b> snow onto leeward faces and loading certain aspects with additional snow, creating dangerous windslabs in certain areas. The avalanche that killed Romeo and Onufer was on a slope that had been adversely affected by windblown snow.|$|R

5000|$|Although storm {{warnings}} {{were posted}} for the Florida and eastern United States coastline, the storm's recurvature prevented a landfall, leaving {{the main effects}} as heavy coastal swells and high winds. Gale-force winds affected the coastline, however. As the cyclone passed closest to New England, Nantucket recorded the highest winds at 56 mph (90 km/h) as the storm remained offshore, although it still contained hurricane-force winds. Winds peaked at 44 mph at Cape Hatteras. Strong gales {{on the evening of}} September 7 caused the Cape Lookout Lightship to be <b>blown</b> <b>loose</b> from her anchorage. Off the coast at the same time, the crew of the Munson Steamer Munloyal, then believed to be 350 mi southeast of Frying Pan Shoals, North Carolina, reported that her position was unknown and her rudder blown away. United States Coast Guard cutters from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, were dispatched to her assistance. [...] Large trees and signs fell down in Brooklyn, New York, due to high winds. Cold temperatures followed {{in the wake of the}} hurricane.|$|E
60|$|One {{of these}} remembrances came to Charlotte Ingelow {{on a spring}} {{afternoon}} when the great orchards about the Grange were pink and white with apple and cherry blossoms, and over every hill and field was a delicate, flower-starred green. A soft breeze was <b>blowing</b> <b>loose</b> petals from the August Sweeting {{through the open door}} of the wide hall when Charlotte came through it. Ellen and George were standing on the steps outside.|$|R
60|$|She {{was wearing}} a calico apron over her dress, an apron that had evidently been {{designed}} for a large woman. Swathed in its folds, she suggested a child playing at being grown up. Her sleeves were rolled back to the elbow, and her slim arms dripped with water. Strands of brown hair were <b>blowing</b> <b>loose</b> in the evening breeze. To John she had never seemed so bewitchingly pretty. He stared at her till the pallor of her face {{gave way to a}} warm red glow.|$|R
60|$|The car glided {{out of the}} yard, {{leaped from}} level to slope, and started swiftly down the road, {{out into the open}} valley. Each {{stronger}} rush of dry wind in Madeline's face marked the increase of speed. She took one glance at the winding cattle-road, smooth, unobstructed, disappearing in the gray of distance. She took another at the leather-garbed, leather-helmeted driver beside her, and then she drew the hood of veils over her face and fastened it round her neck so there was no possibility of its <b>blowing</b> <b>loose.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the winter}} of 1902, the last season spent {{excavating}} at Abydos, Hilda was given control of an excavation of her own. The team comprised Margaret Murray, and Miss Hansard, an artist, as well as Hilda, and attempted a difficult and hazardous excavation to after the discovery the previous year of {{what appeared to be}} the approach to a huge underground tomb discovered in an area at the back of the temple of Seti I. The deep excavation was in constant danger of caving in and, when the wind <b>blew,</b> <b>loose</b> sand and shifting stone blocks threatened the workers below; the work was ultimately abandoned.

60|$|Blake {{called him}} to help in {{dragging}} the sled over an obstacle, and the difficulties of the way afterward occupied his attention. When they found clearer ground they made good progress, and, late in the afternoon, seeing a rocky spur running out from the hillside, they headed for it {{to look for a}} sheltered camping place.

60|$|She rose {{suddenly}} to her feet, crossed the floor, and {{threw open the}} window. The breeze swept through the room, flapping the curtains, <b>blowing</b> about <b>loose</b> articles into a strange confusion. She stood there for several moments, as though in search of some respite from the emotional atmosphere upon which she had turned her back. When she finally closed the window, her hair was in little strands about her face. Her eyes were soft and her lips quivering.|$|R
40|$|In arid and {{semiarid}} regions, {{dust storms}} are common during windy seasons. Strong wind can <b>blow</b> <b>loose</b> sand from the dry surface. The rising sand and dust is then transported {{to other places}} depending on the wind conditions (speed and direction) {{at different levels of}} the atmosphere. Considering dust as a moving object in space and time, trajectory calculation then can be used to determine the path it will follow. Trajectory calculation is used as a forecast supporting tool for both operational and research activities. Predefined dust sources can be identified and the trajectories can be precalculated from the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) forecast. In case of long distance transported dust, the tool should allow the operational forecaster to perform online trajectory calculation. This paper presents a case study for using trajectory calculation based on NWP models as a forecast supporting tool in Oman Meteorological Service during some dust storm events. Case study validation results showed a good agreement between the calculated trajectories and the real transport path of the dust storms and hence trajectory calculation can be used at operational centers for warning purposes...|$|R
5000|$|Geologically {{extremely}} young, Padre Island is {{a vastly}} [...] geologic feature. Unlike most of today's geologic features, {{such as the}} Grand Canyon or the likes, Padre Island changes constantly. Situated in a stable depository basin, there isn't much that can intervene with the barrier bars, except for the occasional hurricanes that come by. Most of Padre Island is less than 20 feet above mean sea level. Constant bombardment of prevailing southeasterly winds from the Gulf of Mexico heap beach of sand into high foredunes. In some places, the onshore wind may <b>blow</b> <b>loose</b> sand from the foredunes and beach across the flats beyond. Active sand dunes march across the island, smothering vegetation in their paths and leaving barren sandflats in their wakes. In other places, vegetation may win a battle of its own and stabilize the blowing sand by binding it with roots and vines. Slower daily movements of the sand and stabilizing effects of vegetation are interrupted occasionally by the brutal force of hurricane winds, waves, and tides. During storms, beaches are eroded, vegetation is ripped up, dunes are flattened, and channels are scoured across the island.|$|R

60|$|Our next day's {{progress}} {{was no less}} than a nightmare. Crawling along, unpacking and carrying, and packing again, we toiled {{up and down the}} interminable length of three almost impassable miles. When night overtook us it was in a bad place to camp. No grass, no water! A cold gale blew out of the west. It roared through the forest. It <b>blew</b> everything <b>loose</b> away in the darkness. It almost blew us away in our beds. The stars appeared radiantly coldly white up in the vast blue windy vault of the sky. A full moon soared majestically. Shadows crossed the weird moon-blanched forest glades.|$|R
5000|$|Formerly {{the area}} {{which is now}} the Culbin Forest was <b>loose</b> <b>blowing</b> sand dunes, called the Culbin Sands. The area had been fertile farmland, but was {{gradually}} covered in loose sand, particularly during a windstorm in 1694. The area remained largely dune desert for two centuries, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Scotland's Sahara". In the 20th century the Forestry Commission planted the area with forest.|$|R

Though he did this with the greatest confidence, he did it (as it struck me) in so ignorant a manner, and so spoilt everything he touched, that when he began upon the purple smoke from the chimney of the distant cottage of the proprietor of the golden harvest (which smoke was beautifully soft), I found myself saying aloud, without considering of it: ...|$|R
60|$|Another, strangely, {{recalls a}} silent man. And {{yet it was}} not din that was wanting; in fact, it was terrific. That one was a gale that came upon the ship swiftly, like a parnpero, which last is a very sudden wind indeed. Before we knew very well what was coming all the sails we had set had burst; the furled ones were <b>blowing</b> <b>loose,</b> ropes flying, sea hissing--it hissed tremendously--wind howling, and the ship lying on her side, so {{that half of the}} crew were {{swimming}} and the other half clawing desperately at whatever came to hand, according {{to the side of the}} deck each man had been caught on by the catastrophe, either to leeward or to windward. The shouting I need not mention--it was the merest drop in an ocean of noise--and yet the character of the gale seems contained in the recollection of one small, not particularly impressive, sallow man without a cap and with a very still face. Captain Jones--let us call him Jones--had been caught unawares. Two orders he had given at the first sign of an utterly unforeseen onset; after that the magnitude of his mistake seemed to have overwhelmed him. We were doing what was needed and feasible. The ship behaved well. Of course, it was some time before we could pause in our fierce and laborious exertions; but all through the work, the excitement, the uproar, and some dismay, we were aware of this silent little man at the break of the poop, perfectly motionless, soundless, and often hidden from us by the drift of sprays.|$|R

50|$|When this {{downdraft}} of cold air, or downburst, {{reaches the}} ground, it <b>blows</b> dry, <b>loose</b> silt and clay (collectively, dust) {{up from the}} desert, creating a wall of sediment that precedes the storm cloud. This wall of dust can be up to 100 km wide and several kilometers in elevation. At their strongest, haboob winds often travel at 35 - 100 km/h, and they may approach {{with little or no}} warning. Often rain does not appear at ground level as it evaporates in the hot, dry air (a phenomenon known as virga). The evaporation cools the rushing air even further and accelerates it. Occasionally, when the rain does persist, it can contain a considerable quantity of dust. Severe cases are called mud storms. Eye and respiratory system protection are advisable for anyone who must be outside during a haboob. Moving to shelter is highly advised during a strong event.|$|R
40|$|Wind erosion is {{a dynamic}} {{physical}} process that leads to environmental degradation when strong winds <b>blow</b> on <b>loose,</b> dry, bare soils, creating dust events that can impact human health, visibility and air quality. Since 1932, more than two thousand dust event days were recorded at El Paso, averaging 25 per year. This research analyzes and models data on dust events in the El Paso/Juarez metropolitan area for better understanding of their effects. The meteorological characteristics of these events are analyzed for variables such as the frequency, visibility, and average wind speeds associated with convective and non-convective events. These variables are further correlated with other parameters including particulate matter concentrations, relative humidity and associated precipitation to determine their relationships. Air transport pathways into El Paso during days with dust events (classified as convective and non-convective in nature), as well as days in which dust was not reported, were created with the HYSPLIT model and statistically analyzed. During 2001 - 2005, dust events were recorded on 12...|$|R

50|$|The tornado moved {{northeast}} at 50 mi/h km/h {{across the}} Everglades, entering northwest Dade County and then southwest Broward County. Subsequently, the tornado struck {{the communities of}} Sunrise, Lauderhill, North Lauderdale, Margate, Pompano Beach, and Lighthouse Point. It first hit several homes and a recreation center in Sunrise, causing extensive damage. As it moved through Sunrise, the tornado downed power poles, wires, screen enclosures, trees, and mailboxes. Doors at the Sunrise city hall were blown open, allowing debris inside that covered {{the first floor of}} the building. Damage was widespread throughout the city, particularly along and near Oakland Park Boulevard. At least three funnel clouds were reported in Sunrise, and at least one tornado touchdown was alleged. Windows were broken in hundreds of homes, while trees and power lines were prostrated. The mayor of the town of Sunrise, John Lomelo, declared a state of emergency in the town at 8:15 a.m., upon hearing of damage to city hall and across the city. Next, the tornado blew a porch from a home in Lauderhill. In North Lauderdale, the tornado damaged 30 to 40 homes in a four-block area, <b>blowing</b> awnings <b>loose</b> and uprooting trees. In Margate, the tornado affected the 600 and 700 blocks along SW 51st Avenue. A home was unroofed, another home lost most of its roof, and trees and power lines were downed. The tornado tore a bedroom door from its hinges, broke glass, and snapped a 40 ft tall Norfolk Island pine tree in half.|$|R
