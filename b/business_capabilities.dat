The {{first of the}} race that the eye of Record, {{piercing}} the deepening mists upon the centuries behind her, is able to discern with any clearness is a long-haired, sea-bronzed personage, whom men call variously Inge or Unger. Out of the wild North Sea he has come. Record observes him, one of a small, fierce group, standing on the sands of desolate Northumbria, staring landward, his worldly wealth upon his back. This consists of a two-handed battle-axe, value perhaps some forty stycas in the currency of the time. A careful man, with <b>business</b> <b>capabilities,</b> may, however, manipulate a small capital to great advantage. In what would appear, to those accustomed to our slow modern methods, an incredibly short space of time, Inge's two-handed battle-axe has developed into wide lands and many head of cattle; which latter continue to multiply with a rapidity beyond the dreams of present- day breeders. Inge's descendants {{would seem to have}} inherited the genius of their ancestor, for they prosper and their worldly goods increase. They are a money-making race. In all times, out of all things, by all means, they make money. They fight for money, marry for money, live for money, are ready to die for money.|$|E

According to research firm Gartner, fully 85 % of the fortune 500 firms have implemented ERP and increasingly small to medium enterprises (SMEs) are finding ways to incorporate ERP systems. While on one hand when organizations are going for large scale ERP implementations, often a debate is raised whether ERP deployment contributes towards the <b>business</b> flexibility <b>capabilities</b> of firms or not. Using a conceptual model firmly grounded in the resource- based view as a frame of reference was developed, hypotheses generated and tested for 53 large Indian manufacturing firms, with respondents being senior most business and IT executives to investigate the potential link between ES resources and its contribution to <b>business</b> flexibility <b>capabilities</b> and contribution of <b>business</b> flexibility <b>capabilities</b> on performance. For this, three important relationships are posited between: ES resources and <b>business</b> flexibility <b>capabilities,</b> <b>business</b> flexibility <b>capabilities</b> and firm performance and ES resources and firm performance Findings of this study highlights that ES resources was not positively associated with <b>business</b> flexibility <b>capabilities,</b> also association between <b>business</b> flexibility <b>capabilities</b> with firm performance was low. Based on the strong empirical evidence, the study suggested that ES resources are not contributing towards <b>business</b> flexibility <b>capabilities</b> and managers going for such systems should tread with caution...|$|R
