25|$|When coupled, {{the power}} for the ramps, pumps, {{floodlights}} and other equipment on board the barge is taken from the pusher. When the power cables on the starboard side of the pusher's superstructure are disconnected, a 200 kVA Volvo Penta TD100CRC generating set starts automatically and provides power to operate the equipment when the barge is left alone for loading or unloading. To increase maneuverability in ports the barges are equipped with a 680kW controllable-pitch <b>bow</b> <b>thruster</b> which is powered by the pusher's shaft generator.|$|E
25|$|On 14 November 2012, Marion Dufresne ran aground as {{she reached}} Crozet Islands as part of third {{resupply}} campaign of the year. The incident resulted in a 25-metre breach in the hull, flooding of two watertight compartments, and disabling of the <b>bow</b> <b>thruster.</b> The crew managed to control the damages and safely returned the vessel off the island. The 110 passengers were evacuated by the on-board helicopter to the small station located on the island. After being assessed for seaworthiness, repairs were effected at the Elgin Brown & Hamer shipyard in Durban, South Africa. A similar accident occurred in 2005.|$|E

25|$|Salvor is {{the third}} ship of the {{auxiliary}} rescue and salvage class of vessel constructed for the US Navy. The rugged construction of this steel-hulled vessel, combined with her speed and endurance, make Salvor well-suited for rescue and salvage operations throughout the world. The hull below the waterline is ice-strengthened. Her propulsion plant can develop 4200 shaft horsepower with four Caterpillar399 diesel engines coupled in pairs to two shafts. She is fitted with a Controllable Reversible Pitch (CRP) propeller within a Kort nozzle on each shaft. The CRP propeller/Kort nozzle combination produces greater thrust and more maneuverability control than conventional propellers. Salvor is also configured with a <b>bow</b> <b>thruster</b> which provides athwartship thrust for additional control of the bow when the ship's speed is less than five knots (9km/h).|$|E
25|$|Princess of the Stars, {{flagship}} of the Sulpicio Lines fleet, {{left the}} port of Manila on June 20, 2008, en route to Cebu City. Although Typhoon Fengshen, locally known as Typhoon Frank, had made landfall at Samar Island earlier the same day, Princess of the Stars was permitted to sail because the vessel was large enough to stay afloat in the typhoon's periphery. However, Fengshen unexpectedly changed course later that day, placing the ferry in serious danger of being overwhelmed by the storm. At midday on June 21, the ferry sent out a distress signal; radio contact was lost at 12:30 PST (04:30 GMT). The mayor of San Fernando, Nanette Tansingco, sent a speedboat and confirmed that the ferry had {{a hole in the}} hull and was partially submerged, and that several bodies had been found nearby. Later reports revealed that the hole in the hull was actually the ship's <b>bow</b> <b>thruster.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{there were}} no {{external}} witnesses of the capsizing of Finn-Baltic, it was noticed by several people on the shore shortly afterwards and the rescue operation began within minutes of the accident even though the ship had not sent a distress signal. Around 12:30 the harbour bailiff of the Port of Hanko saw something odd amid the waves while standing at {{the window of his}} office. At first he thought it was just a barge being towed by a tug, but after spotting first the red bottom of the vessel and then its propeller and rudder, he realized that a ship had capsized in the storm and immediately contacted the captain of the rescue vessel Russarö, who alerted the Maritime Rescue Sub-Centre (MRSC) of Hanko at 12:40. At the same time a harbour worker standing on one of the easternmost quays saw something that resembled a new island {{in the middle of the}} storm. At first he, too, thought that it was just a towing, but was bothered by several strange details in the barge, such as the <b>bow</b> <b>thruster,</b> and decided to go get binoculars. When he came back to get a better view, he saw Russarö heading out. Finn-Baltic was also photographed only minutes before the combination capsized by a harbour worker, who remembered hearing a rumbling sound, like a freight train, shortly after taking the picture of the ship.|$|E
50|$|The vessel {{is powered}} by two Wartsila 8L46D, 9240kW each, diesel engines which drive two propellers. The vessel is also {{equipped}} with two Wärtsilä CT200 <b>bow</b> <b>thrusters.</b>|$|R

25|$|Botnica {{was one of}} {{the first}} icebreakers to be {{equipped}} with Azipod propulsion, ABB's brand of electric azimuth thrusters developed in Finland. The two 5 MW Azipod VI1600A units considerably improve the maneuverability of the icebreaker — the tactical diameter of the turning circle in open water is less than the overall length of the ship. This is especially useful during escort and assistance operations in difficult ice conditions when the icebreaker has to operate at close proximity to other vessels at low speeds. Together with three 1,150-kW Brunvoll FU-80-LTC-2000 variable-pitch <b>bow</b> <b>thrusters</b> the azimuth thrusters also allow dynamic positioning during offshore operations. The <b>bow</b> <b>thrusters</b> are not used in ice.|$|R
