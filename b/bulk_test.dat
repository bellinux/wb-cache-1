40|$|Mg/Ca {{composition}} and test wall profile characteristics have been measured {{in a population}} of Orbulina universa (a symbiotic planktonic foraminifera) obtained from a core-top sediment sample from off the west Australian coast (20 º 04 S, 112 º 66 E). Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) and electron microprobe {{have been used to}} determine the distribution of Mg/Ca and other elements at micron/submicron-scale resolution within individual foraminifera shells. LA-ICPMS profiles and EMPA maps reveal the development of up to 6 alternating low and high Mg/Ca bands that increase in amplitude and Mg/Ca value toward the outer test surface. These results, gether with the reported duration of test calcification (e. g. Caron et al., 1987), to indicate the Mg/Ca composition of calcite precipitated by O. universa is strongly regulated on a diurnal cycle (Eggins et al., 2004). The development of Mg/Ca banding in O. universa can be linked to the day-time photosynthetic activity of algal symbionts and night-time respiration of both the host foraminifer and symbionts, which modulate the pH and calcite saturation state within the foraminiferal microenvironment (Wolf-Gleadrow and Riebesell, 1997). We attribute the high and low Mg/Ca bands to night-time and day-time calcification respectively based on previously documented increase in <b>bulk</b> <b>test</b> Mg/Ca composition with decreasing seawater pH (Lea et al., 1999). ‘Vital effects ’ similar to those observed in O. universa may affect other symbiont bearing species, and could bias <b>bulk</b> <b>test</b> Mg/Ca compositions and thus derived estimates of palaeo-seawater temperature. Our results provide new insights into the potential importance of such ‘vital effects ’ in controlling the Mg/Ca composition of foraminiferal calcite. They also emphasise the need for a more complete understanding of influences upon the Mg/Ca composition of foraminiferal calcite in order to evaluate both the precision and accuracy of Mg/Ca paleo-seawater thermometry based on <b>bulk</b> <b>test</b> compositions...|$|E

There are two main parts in this study, the dry <b>bulk</b> <b>tests</b> (dehydrated crude oil) and the wet <b>bulk</b> <b>tests</b> (to which desalter brine was added). Three barrels of desalted crude oil provided by Amoco Oil Company were studied. For the dry <b>bulk</b> <b>tests,</b> no brine {{was added to the}} crude oil. The effects of fluid velocity and surface temperature on fouling were investigated. The higher the surface temperature the greater the fouling was observed. Fouling decreased with an increase of fluid velocity. Fluid velocity had a stronger effect on fouling at low surface temperatures than at high surface temperatures. It was also observed that the fouling behavior of crude oil depended on small difference in composition. The threshold surface temperatures for the initiation of fouling were 400 - 450 °F (3. 0 ft/sec), 525 - 550 °F (5. 5 ft/sec), 550 - 600 °F (8. 0 ft/sec) and about 600 °F (10. 0 ft/sec) for Barrel No. 2 and Barrel No. 3.

For bonded aerospace applications, adhesives must withstand high-temperatures (200 °C or above, {{depending on the}} application), which implies their mechanical characterization under identical conditions.

This work proposes and validates damage laws for a thin layer of an epoxy adhesive at room temperature (RT), 100, 150, and 200 °C using the XFEM.

On the other hand, the value of G Ic of the adhesive, extracted from the DCB data, was shown to be relatively insensitive to temperature up to the glass transition temperature (T g), while above T g (at 200 °C) a great reduction took place. The output of the DCB numerical simulations for the various temperatures showed a good agreement with the experimental results, which validated the obtained data for strength prediction of bonded joints in tension.

Thermal analysis of master alloy (DTA) and samples in as-cast state (DSC) was realized. For amorphous structure confirmation the X-ray diffraction phase analysis (XRD) was realized. Additionally scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs were performed in order to structure analysis. Thermal conductivity was determined by prototype measuring station. Findings: The XRD and SEM analysis confirmed amorphous structure of samples. Broad diffraction “halo” was observed for every testing piece. Fracture morphology is smooth with many “veins” on the surface, which are characteristic for glassy state. DTA analysis confirmed eutectic chemical composition of master alloy. Thermal conductivity measurements proved that both samples have comparable thermal conductivity.

Conventionally, the dynamics of test particles as observed in 4 D is discussed {{on the basis of}} the splitting of the geodesic equation in 5 D. However, this procedure is not unique and therefore leads to some problems. The most serious one is the ambiguity in the definition of rest mass in 4 D, which is crucial for the discussion of the dynamics. We propose the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, instead of the geodesic one, to study the dynamics in 4 D. On the basis of this formalism we provide an unambiguous expression for the rest mass and its variation along the motion as observed in 4 D.

40|$|Introduction: The {{prognosis}} of glioblastoma (GBM) {{treated with}} standard-of-care maximal surgical resection and concurrent adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) /radiotherapy remains very poor (less than 15 months). GBMs {{have been found}} to contain a small population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that contribute to tumor propagation, maintenance, and treatment resistance. The highly invasive nature of high-grade gliomas and their inherent resistance to therapy lead to very high rates of recurrence. For these reasons, not all patients with similar diagnoses respond to the same chemotherapy, schedule, or dose. Administration of ineffective anticancer therapy is not only costly but more importantly burdens the patient with unnecessary toxicity and selects for the development of resistant cancer cell clones. We have developed a drug response assay (ChemoID) that identifies the most effective chemotherapy against CSCs and bulk of tumor cells from of a panel of potential treatments, offering great promise for individualized cancer management. Providing the treating physician with drug response information on a panel of approved drugs will aid in personalized therapy selections of the most effective chemotherapy for individual patients, thereby improving outcomes. A prospective study was conducted evaluating the use of the ChemoID drug response assay in GBM patients treated with standard of care. Methods: Forty-one GBM patients (mean age 54 years, 59 % male), all eligible for a surgical biopsy, were enrolled in an Institutional Review Board–approved protocol, and fresh tissue samples were collected for drug sensitivity testing. Patients were all treated with standard-of-care TMZ plus radiation with or without maximal surgery, depending on the status of the disease. Patients were prospectively monitored for tumor response, time to recurrence, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Odds ratio (OR) associations of 12 -month recurrence, PFS, and OS outcomes were estimated for CSC, bulk tumor, and combined assay responses for the standard-of-care TMZ treatment; sensitivities/specificities, areas under the curve (AUCs), and risk reclassification components were examined. Results: Median follow-up was 8 months (range 3 - 49 months). For every 5 % increase in in vitro CSC cell kill by TMZ, 12 -month patient response (nonrecurrence of cancer) increased two-fold, OR =  2. 2 (P = . 016). Similar but somewhat less supported associations with the bulk tumor test were seen, OR =  2. 75 (P = . 07) for each 5 % bulk tumor cell kill by TMZ. Combining CSC and bulk tumor assay results in a single model yielded a statistically supported CSC association, OR =  2. 36 (P = . 036), but a much attenuated remaining bulk tumor association, OR =  1. 46 (P = . 472). AUCs and [sensitivity/specificity] at optimal outpoints (> 40 % CSC cell kill and > 55 % bulk tumor cell kill) were AUC =  0. 989 [sensitivity =  100 /specificity =  97], 0. 972 [100 / 89], and 0. 989 [100 / 97] for the CSC only, bulk tumor only, and combined models, respectively. Risk categorization of patients was improved by 11 % when using the CSC test in conjunction with the <b>bulk</b> <b>test</b> (risk reclassification nonevent net reclassification improvement [NRI] and overall NRI =  0. 111, P = . 030). Median recurrence time was 20 months for patients with a positive (> 40 % cell kill) CSC test versus only 3 months for those with a negative CSC test, whereas median recurrence time was 13 months versus 4 months for patients with a positive (> 55 % cell kill) <b>bulk</b> <b>test</b> versus negative. Similar favorable results for the CSC test were observed for PFS and OS outcomes. Panel results across 14 potential other treatments indicated that 34 / 41 (83 %) potentially more optimal alternative therapies may have been chosen using CSC results, whereas 27 / 41 (66 %) alternative therapies may have been chosen using bulk tumor results. Conclusions: The ChemoID CSC drug response assay has the potential to increase the accuracy of bulk tumor assays to help guide individualized chemotherapy choices. GBM cancer recurrence may occur quickly if the CSC test has a low in vitro cell kill rate even if the bulk tumor test cell kill rate is high...|$|E

Vikingstad and Aarra (2009) used a blender to disperse air for generating foam at a somewhat higher temperature (50  °C). They noted the decrease in foam height with time and compared results with coreflood stability tests in which N 2 and surfactant solution were simultaneously injected at a moderate rate and pressure to yield a transitional foam quality (qT = 40  ml/h, Pinj = 120  bar/ 1764 psig, and Fg = 80 %). They observed that the foam stability and strength were similar in both <b>bulk</b> foam stability <b>tests</b> and coreflood stability tests in oil-free conditions. Also, Jones et al.

Huahui 938, Quan 9311 A, Fengliangyou 4 and TN 1 were used as susceptible controls, while Luohong 4 A and the donor parent B 5 were used as the BPH resistant controls. The BPH samples used in the test were collected {{from the field and}} were continuously reared on TN 1 in the laboratory at Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU), Wuhan, China. The bioassay was performed using a modified seedling <b>bulk</b> <b>test</b> following the SSST (Velusamy et al. 1986; Horgan 2009). Thirty pre-germinated seeds of each entry, including the improved lines and controls with three replications, were evenly sown in 7 [*]×[*] 7 [*]×[*] 8  cm plastic plates. All entries were randomly arranged in a large pool. When the seedlings reached the second leaf stage, they were thinned to 20 plants per plate. At the third-leaf stage, the seedlings were infested with 2 nd- 3 rd-instar BPH nymphs at a rate of 8 – 10 insects per seedling, and the water was maintained at a depth of approximately 0.5  cm above the root until the evaluation was completed. All seedlings were patted once, 24  h after the infestation, to evenly redistribute the nymphs. When all TN 1 plants died, the other plants were examined and the following scores were given: 0 (no damage), 1 (very slight damage), 3 (the first and second leaf of most plants were yellowing), 5 (yellowing, nearly half of the plants had wilted or were dead), 7 (more than half of the plants were dead and the rest were seriously dwarfed) and 9 (all plants were dead) according to the modified criteria based on the Standard Evaluation System for Rice (IRRI 2002). An average resistance score of 0.1 – 1.9 was designated as highly resistant (HR), 2.0 – 3.9 as resistant (R), 4.0 – 5.9 as moderately resistant (MR), 6.0 – 7.9 as susceptible (S), and 8.0 – 9.0 as highly susceptible (HS) (IRRI 2002).|$|E

40|$|Foams can do {{more than}} soften a beard or {{extinguish}} a fire. Foam also offers the oil industry better mobility control. The presence of a foaming agent in porous rocks can reduce the mobility of gas and water, stabilize the gas injection front and prevent unwanted production of gas and water. These unique properties can assist the reservoir engineer in different optimization processes to enhance oil recovery (EOR) and improve the economics of mature oil fields. A number of factors influence the properties of foam, such as the foaming agent, gas type, rock properties, interactions with oil, injection strategies, and temperature and pressure conditions. A change in one or several of these parameters may affect the performance of the foam and, consequently, the success of the intended foam application. For that reason, {{it is important to understand}} foam on a broad experimental scale. This thesis presents experimental studies of foam in bulk and porous media. The studies in porous media investigated: I) CO 2 -foam properties compared with those of N 2 - foams and II) the impact of rock material on foam generation performance and mobility control. The experiments were performed in oil-free outcrop sandstone core samples in the range of 30 - 280 bar and 50 - 100 °C using alpha-olefin sulfonate (AOSC 14 -C 16) surfactant. The studies in bulk evaluated a set of foaming agents relative to: I) various experimental methods (bulk tests, core flooding), II) different gas types (CO 2, N 2, air) and III) the absence and presence of oils (crude oils, alkanes). A new <b>bulk</b> <b>test</b> was designed in the thesis to allow foams with gases other than air to be studied under low pressure. The combination of several experimental approaches was introduced to improve the evaluation and screening of surfactants. The experimental results obtained in this thesis show that the presence of different gas types (CO 2, N 2) strongly influences the properties of foam in bulk and in porous media. The CO 2 -foams were inherently weaker than the N 2 -foams. Possible reasons for the apparent weakness of the CO 2 -foam compared with the N 2 -foam were investigated more closely. A good correlation between the CO 2 -density and the CO 2 -foam strength was found; conditions where the density of CO 2 is low improved the CO 2 -foam strength. Also, new foam experiments with pre-equilibrated fluids were conducted. These experiments suggested that the kinetics of the mass transfer between CO 2 and the surfactant solution could not be the main cause why the CO 2 -foams were weaker than the N 2 -foams. However, the use of preequilibrated fluids significantly improved the water-blocking capabilities of the CO 2 -foams, indicating that gas dissolution into the injected water is one of the predominant mechanisms that weaken the CO 2 -foams during liquid injection following generation. N 2 -foam experiments in various outcrop sandstone core samples showed that the rock material is one of the main parameters controlling the in-situ foam generation performance. The results demonstrated that foam was able to be generated and reduce mobility in all the sandstone cores used under all the conditions listed above. However, large variations in foam strength and mobility control were obtained between the different core samples. The presence of low permeability laminated heterogeneities, detected through various types of core analysis, appeared to be one of the parameters affecting the foam generation performance. The detailed interactions between the rock surface properties and the thin liquid films were beyond the scope of this thesis, but are suggested to be of central importance to in-situ foam generation performance. The combination of several experimental techniques, including the new <b>bulk</b> <b>test,</b> was shown to be valuable for improving the evaluation and screening of foamers in the absence and presence of oil. Although certain similarities and interesting trends were observed between the experiments in bulk and porous media, the bulk foam properties of this work did not generally correlate with the foam properties in porous media. It seems difficult to predict foam properties and performance separate from the porous media by means of simpler experimental methods. It is hoped that the laboratory-derived results presented in this dissertation will contribute to generate new insights and ideas within the field of foam, provide valuable input to reservoir models and simulations, and suggest practical considerations towards the scaling of foam processes for different EOR applications. </p...|$|E
