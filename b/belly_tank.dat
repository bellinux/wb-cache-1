25|$|With no {{more than}} two FW-190s left in the cover flight he had attacked, Whisner turned his {{attention}} to the main enemy formation, exploding a FW-190 that had not dropped its <b>belly</b> <b>tank.</b> Evading three FW-190s on his tail, he shot down another that was closing on one of his pilots. Then, low on ammunition, he joined up with Meyer and returned to Bodney.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{equipment}} can be equipped, dependent on operator choice and role; these include an external hoist, dual cargo hook, dual flight controls, baggage compartment extension, snow skis, windshield wipers, rotor brake, multi-band radios, active noise reduction headsets, soundproofing, oxygen systems, loud speakers, search lights, retractable landing light, emergency floatation equipment, reinforced windshield, wire strike protection system, rappelling kit, fire fighting <b>belly</b> <b>tank,</b> and a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera. Three fuel tanks, located behind the rear {{seats in the}} cabin, are installed as standard; up to two additional optional tanks can be fitted {{for a total of}} five, providing a flight endurance of nearly six hours.|$|E
25|$|Captain (Air Corps) William T. Whisner Jr., United States Army Air Forces, {{was awarded}} the Distinguished Service Cross for {{extraordinary}} heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy while serving as Pilot of a P-51 Fighter Airplane in the 487th Fighter Squadron, 352d Fighter Group, Eighth Air Force, in aerial combat against enemy forces on 21 November 1944, during an air mission in the European Theater of Operations. On that date, Captain Whisner led a flight of P-51s on an escort mission to Merseburg, Germany. As the bombers left their target, a large formation of enemy fighters struck. In a linked series of attacks, Whisner shot down four FW-190s in the cover flight and probably got another. With {{no more than two}} FW-190s left in the cover flight he had attacked, Whisner {{turned his attention to the}} main enemy formation, exploding an FW-190 that had not dropped its <b>belly</b> <b>tank.</b> Evading three FW-190s on his tail, he shot down another that was closing on one of his pilots. Whisner was credited with five FW-190s and two probables that day. His score later was revised by the Air Force Historical Research Center to six destroyed, making that day one of the best for any USAAF pilot in the skies over Europe. Captain Whisner's unquestionable valor in aerial combat is in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself, the 8th Air Force, and the United States Army Air Forces.|$|E

2500|$|Although the T-6 {{entered the}} FAC {{role as a}} [...] "hot" [...] aircraft, it was soon {{encumbered}} with numerous adaptations that degraded its performance. With a load that included a long range <b>belly</b> <b>tank,</b> smoke grenades, and a dozen smoke rockets added under each wing for marking targets adding half a ton of added weight, the T-6 was limited to {{a top speed of}} , and its service ceiling was considerably reduced. [...] The T-6's low wing restricted view and its lowered performance was a detriment to its role in forward air control. The 6147th tested the L-19, later known as the O-1 Bird Dog. However, it offered no better performance than the Texan and its lack of armor left it vulnerable to ground fire. There was also an abortive attempt to use the L-17 Navion as a FAC aircraft. The Navion's low wing design precluded much success in observation. However, the T-6s did not go unscathed, as 20 were lost in action by December 1950.|$|E

25|$|The {{water or}} {{retardant}} is carried in three center-line <b>belly</b> <b>tanks.</b> The tanks have internal baffles to prevent fluid shift (and consequent shift {{in center of}} gravity) while in flight, and sit with a 15-inch (38cm) ground clearance.

The retardant is gravity-fed out of the tanks, and the entire load can be dumped in eight seconds, although the actual drop rate is computer controlled by the flight crew in order to produce the desired retardant spread over the fire lines. The aircraft is capable of applying a line of retardant 300ft (91m) wide by 1 mile (1.6km) long.|$|R
