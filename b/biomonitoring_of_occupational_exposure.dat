40|$|International audienceAdequate {{interpretation}} <b>of</b> <b>biomonitoring</b> results <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> to chemicals requires comparison values {{also referred}} to as biological interpretation values. Among these values are those derived in France by Anses, which are based on a structured approach led collectively by independent and multidisciplinary groups of scientific experts. Two types <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> biological values are recommended by Anses: biological limit values and biological reference values. These values are derived from the data available in the scientific literature. The article first shows that the derivation by Anses of the biological values to be used for <b>biomonitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> is linked {{to the nature of the}} chemical examined. Depending upon whether the substance is a threshold or non-threshold toxicant, such as genotoxic carcinogens, the approach will be different. Next, some specific examples are presented (cadmium, styrene, 2 -butoxyethanol and acrylamide) to help occupational physicians with the informed interpretation <b>of</b> <b>biomonitoring</b> results collected in workplaces.

A cross sectional survey was conducted at Tumbi designated regional hospital and Dodoma regional hospital, Tanzania in February 2012. A self-administered questionnaire was used to capture information on knowledge <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to HIV infection. A total of 401 healthcare workers responded to a self-administered questionnaire. High proportion of healthcare workers (96. 3 %) understood that they are at risk <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to HIV. The majority of healthcare workers trained on post exposure prophylaxis procedure and use of personal protective equipment were clinicians (87. 1 % and 71. 4 % respectively) and nurses (81. 8 % and 74. 6 % respectively). Over a quarter of the healthcare workers were not aware of whom to contact in the event <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure.</b> One third <b>of</b> healthcare workers did not have comprehensive knowledge on causes <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> HIV transmission and did not know when post exposure prophylaxis is indicated.

It is hypothesized that fear <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> is a function of estimated likelihood of such events and their perceived importance.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{cross-infection}} {{risks for}} dentists {{have been well}} recognised, and much has been published regarding the incidence <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> to patient body fluids. Less has been reported regarding the risks to dental assistants. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the incidence <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> to patient body fluids among dental assistants, to assess the rate of reporting of such incidents, and to evaluate the association of various factors with these exposures. METHOD: All 84 dental assistants working at Birmingham Dental Hospital were asked to complete a confidential questionnaire to provide retrospective information regarding the nature and incidence <b>of</b> any <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> they had experienced. RESULTS: An overall response rate of 94 % was achieved. Dental nurses experienced fewer <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> than dental students at the same institution, and reported incidents more frequently. More injuries occurred after the treatment session. Handling local anaesthetic syringes was associated with more injuries, and percutaneous injuries predominated. Trainee nurses had experienced more occupational injuries in the preceding six months than their qualified colleagues. There was no significant association with any of the other factors evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The general incidence <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> among the dental assistants in this survey was low in comparison to dental students at the same institution. A further reduction may be possible by increasing the training of unqualified nurses with particular regard to post-treatment handling of sharp dental instruments and equipment...|$|R

Analyses were based on a subsample of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC study), a prospective cohort. The analyses included 703 incident lung cancer cases among men in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain and Greece. The socioeconomic position was measured using the highest level of education. The estimates of relative indices of inequality (RII) were computed with Cox regression models. We first adjusted for smoking (with detailed information on duration and quantity) and dietary factors (fruits and vegetables consumption) and then for <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures.</b> The exposure to three carcinogens [asbestos, heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) ] was analyzed. The <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> explained 14 % of the socioeconomic inequalities remaining after adjustment for smoking and fruits and vegetables consumption. The inequalities remained nevertheless statistically significant. The RII decreased from 1. 87 (95 % CI: 1. 36 - 2. 56) to 1. 75 (1. 27 - 2. 41). The decrease was more pronounced when adjusting for asbestos than for heavy metals or PAH.

Less is known about the effect <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to metals, dust, and gases and fumes on development of oral clefts. Methods: This case-malformed control study used data from a population-based birth defects registry (Eurocat) of children and foetuses born in the Northern Netherlands between 1997 and 2013. Cases were defined as non-syndromic oral clefts. The first control group had chromosomal/monogenic defects, and the second control group was defined as non-chromosomal/non-monogenic malformed controls. Maternal <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> was estimated through linkage of mothers' occupation with a community-based Job Exposure Matrix (JEM). Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the effect <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures.</b> Odds ratios were adjusted (aORs) for relevant confounders. Results: A total of 387 cases, 1135 chromosomal and 4352 non-chromosomal malformed controls were included in this study. Prevalence <b>of</b> maternal <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> to all agents was 43. 9 % and 41. 0 %/ 37. 7 % among cases and controls, respectively. Oral clefts had significantly increased ORs <b>of</b> maternal <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to pesticides (aOR = 1. 7, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 0 - 3. 1) and dust (aOR = 1. 3, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 1. 6) when using non-chromosomal controls. Subgroup analysis for CL(P) stratified by gender showed a significantly increased risk for male infants exposed to 'other solvents' and exposure to mineral dust for female infants.

Materials and Methods: Retrospective review of two and half year data of ongoing surveillance <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to blood and body fluids in a tertiary care hospital. Results: 103 Health Care Providers (HCP) reported an <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to blood and body fluids during the period under review. These comprised 72 (69. 9 %) doctors, 20 (19. 4 %) nursing personnel, and 11 (10. 6 %) cleaning staff. Of the doctors, 65 % were interns. 53. 4 % HCP had work experience of less than one year. Circumstances of exposure included clinical procedures (48 %), sweeping/handling used sharps (29 %), recapping (16 %), and surgery (6. 9 %). 74. 3 % of the exposures were due to non-compliance with universal precautions and were thus preventable. The device most frequently implicated in causing injury was hollow bore needle (n= 85, 82. 5 %). Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) status of the source was positive in 6. 8 % cases, negative in 53. 4 % cases, and unknown in remaining 39. 8 % cases. Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) was indicated in 100 (97. 08 %) cases and was initiated within 2 h of exposure in 26. 8 % HCP. In 23. 2 % HCP, PEP initiation was delayed beyond 72 h of exposure due to late reporting. Thirteen HCP received expanded and the remaining received basic regime. Of the 82 HCP followed up, 15 completed the full course, while 55 stopped PEP after the first dose due to negative source status. Twelve HCP with exposure to blood of unknown HIV status discontinued PEP despite counseling. Complete follow-up for seroconversion was very poor among the HCP. HIV status at 6 month of exposure is not known for any HCP. Conclusions: Failure to follow universal precautions including improper disposal of waste was responsible for majority <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures.</b> HCP need to be sensitized regarding hospital waste management, management <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure,</b> need for PEP, and continued follow-up...|$|R

However, there is ongoing controversy regarding the relevance <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to natural and artificial ultraviolet radiation (UV) radiation. OBJECTIVES: We investigated potential associations between natural and artificial UV radiation exposure at work with NMSC in a case-control study conducted in Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. METHODS: <b>Occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> were classified by expert assessment for 527 controls and 618 NMSC cases (515 basal cell carcinoma, BCC). Covariate information was collected via interview and multiple logistic regression models were used to assess associations between UV exposure and NMSC. RESULTS: Lifetime prevalence <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> in the participants was 13 % for natural UV radiation and 7 % for artificial UV radiation. Significant negative associations between <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to natural UV radiation and NMSC were detected for all who had ever been exposed (odds ratio (OR) 0. 47, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 27 - 0. 80); similar results were detected using a semi-quantitative metric of cumulative exposure. The effects were modified by skin complexion, with significantly decreased risks of BCC among participants with light skin complexion. No associations were observed in relation to occupational artificial UV radiation exposure.

HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is an effective antiretroviral treatment course used in preventing potential HIV infection following an accidental <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to HIV. The objective of this cross sectional study was to identify the factors that impact the practice of HIV PEP among health care workers at the National Hospital, Abuja, Nigeria. A cross-sectional survey using self-administered, structured questionnaires was conducted on 182 health care workers at the National Hospital comprising of medical doctors, nurses, and laboratory scientists. A chi-square test of independence was used to assess the association between knowledge of PEP and PEP use. Logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between PEP use and types <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure,</b> existing precautionary policies, and fear of stigma. The results of this study were statistically insignificant with variables PEP knowledge (p= 0. 274), types <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> (p= 0. 575), awareness of precautionary policies (p= 0. 219), and fear of stigma (p= 0. 282), which could be a result of the small sample surveyed.

40|$|Standards for hand-transmitted {{vibration}} predict {{dependent variables}} (e. g. finger blanching) from measurements {{of a few}} independent variables (e. g. vibration magnitude, vibration frequency, exposure duration). This paper illustrates the assumptions in the current International Standard guidelines {{for the evaluation of}} hand-transmitted vibration and compares research methods which may provide information to improve the guidance. Subjective assessments of vibration discomfort have influenced the frequency weighting used in current standards, but the data have been modified greatly for this purpose. Subjective and biodynamic data suggest that the severity of vibration may not be similar for vibration occurring in different axes. Physiological and pathological studies seek to uncover the mechanisms involved in the temporary and permanent changes caused by vibration, but they have yet to contribute to the guidance in standards. Future experimental studies in humans are unlikely to be sufficient to determine how injury depends on the characteristics of vibration exposures at work. Epidemiological studies are required to uncover the effects <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures,</b> but the complexity <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> will prevent the formulation of standards based solely on the results of epidemiological studies. Standards for hand-transmitted vibration include unproven assumptions but, for those assessing the severity <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures,</b> they offer the most reasonable method for predicting the likely effects of vibration. A combination of subjective, biodynamic, physiological, pathological and epidemiological studies is required to improve current guidance. </p...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionInvestigations of {{the effects}} <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to lead on the {{concentrations}} of thyroid hormones in the blood have not produced consistent results. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the effect <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to lead on thyroid hormone concentrations using the results from published studies. MethodsGroup means from studies of the thyroid function of persons occupationally exposed to lead were used in a meta-analysis. Differences between the control and exposed groups, and the slopes between thyroid hormone concentrations and log 10 blood lead concentrations or duration of exposure to lead were estimated using mixed models. The hormones analyzed were thyroid stimulating hormone, total and free thyroxine, and total and free triiodothyronine. ResultsNo differences in mean thyroid hormone concentrations {{were found between the}} exposed and control groups. No relationships were found between blood lead or the duration of exposure to lead and thyroid hormone concentrations. ConclusionThe results of the analysis do not provide evidence for an effect <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> lead <b>exposure</b> on thyroid function in men.

40|$|The {{employers}} {{responsibilities for}} the assessment <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to cytostatics in the workplace were analyzed {{in the light of}} existing legal regulations. Cytostatics may pose a threat to health and life of workers taking care of patients treated oncologically, i. e., pharmacists, physicians, nurses and other personnel. The significant scale <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to cytostatics in Poland is confirmed by the data collected in the Central Register of Data on Exposure to Carcinogenic or Mutagenic Substances, Mixtures, Agents or Technological Processes, maintained by the Nofer Institute <b>of</b> <b>Occupational</b> Medicine, Łódź, Poland. The issue <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> risk assessment <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to cytostatics gives raise to numerous concerns. Polish regulations concerning health protection of employees occupationally exposed to cytostatics are not unequivocal, as they are derived from different areas of the law, especially those applying to hazard classification, labeling and preparation of safety data sheets for cytostatics. There are neither binding <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> limits legally set for active compounds of antineoplastic drugs nor methods for monitoring of these substances concentrations in a worker’s breathing zone and biological material. This prevents the employer to carry out the correct assessment <b>of</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure,</b> the results <b>of</b> which are the basis for preparing the proper preventive strategy. In this article the consequences of amendments to the European chemical legislation for employers responsible for adequate protection of health and life of employees exposed to cytostatics, were discussed, as well as some legal changes aimed at a better health and life protection of workers exposed to cytostatics in a workplace were proposed.
