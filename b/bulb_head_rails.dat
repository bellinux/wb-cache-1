40|$|We have {{developed}} a 'pitch-catch' low frequency-wideband Rayleigh wave EMAT system with a centre frequency of approximately 200 kHz, extending to around 500 kHz and study here its applicability to crack detection in the <b>head</b> of <b>rail</b> tracks. On the <b>head</b> of a <b>rail,</b> the generated waves are strictly speaking a type of guided wave mode as the propagation surface is not a flat halfspace. They propagate along {{the surface of the}} rail penetrating down to a depth of several millimetres. We have used this approach to demonstrate detection of gauge corner and longitudinal cracking in the <b>rail</b> <b>head.</b> On samples containing machined slots we have shown that crack depth can be estimated by measuring the proportion of the ultrasonic wave at a particular frequency that passes underneath the crack. The approach that we have used is fundamentally different to and has several advantages over conventional ultrasonic contact methods and should ultimately facilitate testing the <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> more thoroughly at higher speeds...|$|R

50|$|Vertical blinds use a {{generally}} wider slat {{and one can}} pull a cord to stack the slats together, to one side, or to separate them in the centre and stack them on each end. The slats can be rotated via a rotating shaft in the upper <b>head</b> <b>rail</b> housing, which runs through independent geared carriers that convert the twisting of a tilt rail to a rotation of each individual slat in synchrony. The original vertical blinds were invented in Kansas City, Missouri by Edward Bopp and Fredrick Bopp, who held the original patent. The company name {{at the time was}} Sun Vertical. In the 1960s, the patent and company were sold.|$|R

Wise introduced the tablet signalling system and gave the BNCR its characteristic somersault signals. His resignalling of York Road Station, Belfast in 1897-98 was the largest installation in Ireland. From around 1900, Wise also pioneered the use of reinforced concrete for railway structures, such as the King’s Bridge in Whitehead.|$|R

40|$|Nondestructive {{testing methods}} {{used for the}} testing of rail in tracks {{worldwide}} can be limited by discontinuity location or orientation within the <b>rail.</b> Vertical split <b>head</b> and <b>rail</b> base cracks are among those types of discontinuities {{that are difficult to}} detect, which in some cases may result in a reail failure in service. A noncontact and remote hybrid ultrasonic technique has been developed by combining laser generation with air coupled detection of ultrasonic signals in rails. The test apparatus mounts on a railroad pushcart and tests are performed in motion with all components kept above the running surface of the rail track. Tracks have been tested for vertical split <b>head</b> and <b>rail</b> base cracks with high success in detection...|$|R
40|$|The {{non-uniform}} hardness distribution, metallurgy and ratchetting behaviour of head-hardened Australian {{rail steel}} (AS 60 HH) are studied. In {{a bid to}} extrapolate material properties across the <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> continuum, a unified material model of the <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> has been developed, in which only the hardness of the material is variable. This simplification is shown to enable the material model to reasonably describe ratchetting behaviour across the <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> for heat-treated pearlitic steels. Finally, homogeneous material ratchetting models are used to study the evolution of plastic strain deformation under realistic rail-wheel contact conditions. The results show that non-uniform material properties may compromise ratcheting response with wear progression, thus impacting lifetime of AS 60 HH rail steel and re-railing frequency...|$|R
50|$|Tunnel boring {{machines}} are steered by hydraulic tilting of the cutter <b>head.</b> <b>Rail</b> track vehicles (i.e. trains, trams) are steered by curved guide tracks, including switches, and articulated undercarriages.

Snowmobiles steer the same way by rotating the front skis. Tracked vehicles (i.e. tanks) steer by increasing the drive force on the side opposite of the direction of turn. Horse-drawn sleighs and dog sleds are steered by changing the direction of pull. Zero-turn lawn mowers use independent hydraulic wheel drive {{to turn on the}} spot.|$|R
