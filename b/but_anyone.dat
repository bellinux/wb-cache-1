5|$|As in all Norwegian {{national}} parks, motorized {{land transport}} is banned. However, on Svalbard {{this does not}} include snowmobiles. On the other hand, cycling is banned. The Governor can, however, enforce temporary bans on snowmobiles or even all travel within the national park. Use of helicopters and aircraft for sight-seeing are also prohibited. Polar bears are protected, <b>but</b> <b>anyone</b> outside of settlements is required to carry a rifle to kill polar bears in self-defense, as a last resort, should they attack. Most flora and fauna are protected; the right to gather established with the freedom to roam does not apply in national parks, although there are some exceptions. Hunting is permitted after explicit permit from the Governor, and locals have more access to hunting rights than tourists. Fishing is not permitted, although dispensations can be given.|$|E
5|$|The legal Underbelly DVD was {{released}} 8 May 2008 by Roadshow Entertainment, {{a day after}} the final episode was aired on television. In accordance with the legal suppression, the release was not distributed through any retail or rental outlets in Victoria or on the internet. Roadshow Entertainment has confirmed that all box sets and point of sale displays will carry a sticker or stamp reminding buyers the series is not for sale, distribution or exhibition in Victoria. Legal experts said Victorians who bought the box set interstate and watched it themselves at home would likely not fall foul of the law, <b>but</b> <b>anyone</b> who showed it more widely could be charged with contempt. The DVD has sold 265,000 copies around Australia. In September 2008, a Limited Edition DVD {{was released}}, containing a numbered steel case and an extra disc with a documentary entitled Carl Williams– A Day of Reckoning. The Underbelly soundtrack was released on 29 March 2008, both as a CD and online. It features elements of the score by Burkhard Dallwitz in addition to music tracks that were featured in the series. Underbelly was released on Blu-ray on 5 August 2010.|$|E

The ILO therefore concluded that opposing Stalinism from within the Communist organizations controlled by Stalin's supporters had become impossible, so new organizations had to be formed. In 1933, the ILO was renamed the International Communist League (ICL), which formed the basis of the Fourth International, founded in Paris in 1938.|$|E

[...] His seventh album, Metal Up, a heavy metal compilation with some songs based on Irish folklore, topped the iTunes Metal chart for 2 days following its release in early 2015. Metal Up was described as mix of classic rock, hard rock, and metal, and was praised by Firstherd for its celtic influences in some songs which were [...] "very original when placed in a metal framework". The album was also given a 5 out of 5 score by Rock Review.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} universal acclaim. Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film four stars and wrote, [...] "This {{is not simply}} a good movie. It is one of those movies that brush away our cautions and win our hearts." [...] He later added it to his Great Movies list, structuring the essay as a letter to his grandchildren about the first time they watched it. Michael Sragow of Rolling Stone called Spielberg [...] "a space age Jean Renoir.... for the first time, [...] has put his breathtaking technical skills at the service of his deepest feelings". Derek Malcolm of The Guardian wrote that [...] "E.T. is a superlative piece of popular cinema ... a dream of childhood, brilliantly orchestrated to involve not only children <b>but</b> <b>anyone</b> able to remember being one". Leonard Maltin would include it in his list of [...] "100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century" [...] as one of only two movies from the 1980s. George Will {{was one of the few}} to pan the film, feeling it spread subversive notions about childhood and science.|$|E

On {{the other side of}} the Pacific, Julian Murdoch comments in a Gamers With Jobs analysis of the game that the scenarios featured in Hatoful are [...] "elaborate and multifaceted", and that Hato Moa herself [...] "isn’t just a storyteller, she’s actually a good storyteller". Hatoful Boyfriend was also named the best PC game of 2012 by GameCola; Paul Franzen explains the game's inclusion among higher budget and more technically sophisticated titles as being due to the strength of its storytelling and pathos, stating that [...] "Hatoful Boyfriend isn't just a weird game about heathen human-animal relationships [...] there’s an actual, serious, emotional game here, too". In an article discussing the E3 announcement of the 2014 remake, Carly Smith for The Escapist remarks that Hatoful Boyfriend is [...] "absolutely hilarious", but recommends that players [...] "start the game for a laugh, but stick with it for a ride you wouldn't have expected by looking at the cover".|$|E

Rita Zekas of the Toronto Star also {{recommended the}} book as a Father's Day gift. Kerry J. Byrne noted that the book covers [...] "everything from bacon-curing methods to bacon blogs" [...] and includes [...] "easy recipes". Publishers Weekly reviewed called the book a [...] "voluminous look at all things bacon"; the review concluded, [...] "Readers who, like Lauer, possess a borderline-obsessive love for bacon are likely to embrace this as their new Bible, <b>but</b> <b>anyone</b> else will quickly get their fill." [...] Rachel Forrest of The Portsmouth Herald recommended the book in her [...] "Annual Summer Reading List for Foodies". [...] "Another of my favorites this year is 'Bacon: A Love Story: A Salty Survey of Everybody's Favorite Meat' by Heather Lauer. A book all about bacon... she profiles chefs that use it, odd finds across the nation and plenty of recipes," [...] commented Forrest. The Arizona Republic highlighted the book among its selection of [...] "Books to help turn pages of summer".|$|E
500|$|Chapter six {{addresses}} {{the use of}} animals in entertainment. Cochrane does not oppose the practice of pet-keeping, and accepts that humans do {{have an interest in}} being able to keep pets, but that this interest is not so strong that it can be satisfied at any cost. He argues that pet-keeping should be regulated far more than it is, perhaps through the need for a license, the granting of which would be dependent on individuals proving their ability to care for the animal's well-being. Cochrane is open to euthanizing pets, but only in cases when medical care could not give them a chance at further good experiences. In these cases, providing medical care would be necessary (pet insurance could be a requirement for a license). Neutering pets is argued to be neither a violation of their rights nor a requirement, <b>but</b> <b>anyone</b> who does not have their pets neutered would be required to ensure the wellbeing of any offspring. The same requirements as were established in the chapter on genetic engineering are applied to animal breeding, and Cochrane accepts that this may lead to the extinction of certain breeds. Concerning zoos and circuses, Cochrane argues that animals do not possess a right not to be kept or displayed, but they do possess a right not to be made to suffer. This imposes limitations on the kinds of animals which can be kept (for instance, large animals could not realistically be kept by traveling circuses), the conditions in which they are kept, and the nature of their performances. Hunting, cockfighting, dogfighting, bear baiting and bullfighting are condemned, as is, after some consideration, fishing. Cochrane is potentially open to greyhound and horse racing, or equestrianism generally, but says that [...] "the way that these sports are currently organized and practiced does involve the routine suffering and death of animals and ought to be condemned as such." [...] Such practices include suffering caused during training and racing, and the killing of animals past their peak or who do not display the requisite skills. Before concluding the chapter, Cochrane considers, but rejects, three possible objections to any use of animals in entertainment: first, by appeal to a concept of dignity, which use of the animals undermines; second, an appeal to disrespect, whether or not harm is caused; and third, that the use of animals in entertainment implies ownership, and animals have a right not to be considered property.|$|E
