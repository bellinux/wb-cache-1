On the 22 December 1940, the <b>brewery</b> water tanks {{were hit by}} bombs during the Manchester Blitz, and the <b>brewery</b> had to be closed down for several months, with production moved temporarily to the nearby Hydes <b>Brewery.</b> The <b>brewery</b> was rebuilt with the most up-to-date and modern equipment of the time, {{and was the first}} in Europe to install stainless steel brewing vats.

50|$|By 1900 {{the number}} of <b>breweries</b> had begun to dwindle {{as a result of}} the {{recession}} of the 1890s. In 1901, just after Federation, the new federal government passed the Beer and Excise Act. This act regulated the making and selling of beer and made homebrewing illegal. The provisions in this act, regarded by many as draconian, led to the closure of many <b>breweries.</b> In Sydney 16 out of 21 <b>breweries</b> closed either immediately after the act's introduction or soon afterwards. The remaining <b>breweries</b> began a process of consolidation, with larger <b>breweries</b> buying out the smaller ones. Within a short period of time, only two <b>breweries</b> remained in Sydney: Tooths and Tooheys. In Melbourne, five <b>breweries</b> merged in 1907 to form the giant Carlton and United <b>Breweries.</b>|$|R

5|$|A microbrewery, or craft <b>brewery,</b> {{produces}} {{a limited amount}} of beer. The maximum amount of beer a <b>brewery</b> can produce and still be classed as a microbrewery varies by region and by authority, though is usually around 15,000 barrels (1.8 megalitres, 396 thousand imperial gallons or 475 thousand US gallons) a year. A brewpub is a type of microbrewery that incorporates a pub or other eating establishment. The highest density of breweries in the world, most of them microbreweries, exists in the German Region of Franconia, especially in the district of Upper Franconia, which has about 200 breweries. The Benedictine Weihenstephan <b>Brewery</b> in Bavaria, Germany, can trace its roots to the year 768, as a document from that year refers to a hop garden in the area paying a tithe to the monastery. The <b>brewery</b> was licensed by the City of Freising in 1040, and therefore is the oldest working <b>brewery</b> in the world.|$|E
5|$|A £10 million {{expansion}} {{project was}} embarked upon at the <b>brewery</b> in 1988. Construction {{of a new}} plant increased brewing capacity from 1 million to 1.3 million barrels a year.

5|$|Although {{originally}} bred {{for use on}} farms, {{few members}} of the breed are used for agricultural purposes today, and are now mostly bred for horse shows and working in urban areas.

Within ten years, the industry expanded to 28 breweries, most of them microbreweries or brewpubs. In 2010, New Jersey craft brewers produced 32,000 barrels (992,000 gallons) of craft brew. In 2012, New Jersey liberalized its licensing laws to allow microbreweries to sell beer by the glass {{as part of a}} tour, and sell up to 15.5 gallons (i.e. a keg) for off-premises consumption. The same legislation permits brewpubs to brew up to 10,000 barrels of beer per year, and sell to wholesalers and at festivals.|$|E

In 2000, Bass sold its brewing interests, including their breweries and the Stones brand to the Belgian brewer Interbrew. Interbrew contracted the {{production of}} cask conditioned Stones to Marston's in Burton. Competition concerns forced Interbrew to sell off certain brands in December 2001, including Stones Bitter, which was bought by the American Coors Brewing Company (later Molson Coors). Molson Coors currently produce keg Stones Bitter at their <b>brewery</b> in Tadcaster, and the canned version at their Burton <b>brewery.</b> The cask product was initially contract brewed at the Highgate <b>Brewery</b> in Walsall, West Midlands, before moving to Everards of Leicester in 2005.

5|$|By 1982 16 {{per cent}} of Yorkshire's public houses {{were tied to}} Stones. Bass closed the Cannon <b>Brewery</b> in April 1999 {{with the loss of}} 57 jobs. Bass blamed the closure on the steep decline in sales of cask {{conditioned}} beers (nationally there had been a 14 per cent decline in sales of cask beer over the previous 12 months) which the <b>brewery</b> produced. The brewer realised £1 million in efficiency savings by closing the <b>brewery.</b> The Campaign for Real Ale blamed the brewery's closure on Bass' failure to promote their cask conditioned products. As well as Stones Bitter, the Cannon brewed the small scale Bass Special, Bass Light and Bass Mild brands from the mid-1990s as declining Stones volumes left the <b>brewery</b> with spare capacity. Bass Light and Bass Mild had been sold in the Sheffield area as Stones Mild and Stones Dark Mild respectively.|$|E
