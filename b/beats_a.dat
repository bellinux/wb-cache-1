5|$|When submerged, a crocodilian's {{heart rate}} slows {{down to one}} or two <b>beats</b> <b>a</b> minute, and blood flow to the muscles is reduced. When it rises and takes a breath, its heart rate speeds up in seconds, and the muscles receive newly oxygenated blood. Unlike many marine mammals, {{crocodilians}} have little myoglobin to store oxygen in their muscles. During diving, muscles are supplied with oxygen when an increasing concentration of bicarbonate ions causes haemoglobin in the blood to release oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{made several}} changes from Gerolmo's {{original}} draft. He omitted the Mafia hitman {{and created the}} character Agent Monk, a black FBI specialist who kidnaps Tilman. The scene in which Frank Bailey brutally <b>beats</b> <b>a</b> news cameraman {{was based on an}} actual event; Parker and Colesberry were inspired by a news outtake found during their research, in which a CBS News cameraman was assaulted by a suspect in the 1964 murder case. Parker also wrote a sex scene involving Rupert Anderson and Mrs. Pell. The scene was omitted during filming after Gene Hackman, who portrays Anderson, suggested to Parker that {{the relationship between the two}} characters be more discreet. By January 4, 1988, Parker had written a complete shooting script, which he submitted to Orion executives. Gerolmo did not visit the production during principal photography, due to the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike.|$|E

Produced by Pritish Nandy, publishing director of The Times of India, the film was made on a budget of Rs.25million (US$525,000), marking the sixth {{in a row of}} small to medium budget films made by Pritish Nandy Communications (PNC). Despite being part of a wave of offbeat films that mostly failed to make an impact at the box office, it drew public attention upon its release, which led to a commercial success among a restricted audience targeted by a selective release in twenty cities. It {{was one of the first}} films made in Hinglish, a mixture of Hindi and English. In 2005, she starred in Shaadi No. 1, which had no female lead. This comedy, based on the theme of modern marriage, was directed by David Dhawan, a renowned film director from this genre.|$|E

25|$|He is {{considered}} a literary iconoclast and, alongside William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, a pioneer of the Beat Generation. Kerouac is recognized for his method of spontaneous prose. Thematically, his work covers topics such as Catholic spirituality, jazz, promiscuity, Buddhism, drugs, poverty, and travel. He became an underground celebrity and, with other <b>beats,</b> <b>a</b> progenitor of the hippie movement, although he remained antagonistic toward some of its politically radical elements.|$|E

Although this school is dissolved after Parto <b>beats</b> <b>a</b> Japanese soldier for flirting with his sister, the three remain fiercely dedicated to fighting for independence, and they join the Defenders of the Homeland (PETA) after it is established; Shimazaki holds a leadership role.|$|E

25|$|All cetaceans, {{including}} belugas, have physiological adaptations {{designed to}} conserve oxygen {{while they are}} under water. During a dive, these animals will reduce their heart rate from 100 <b>beats</b> <b>a</b> minute to between 12 and 20. Blood flow is diverted away from certain tissues and organs and towards the brain, heart and lungs, which require a constant oxygen supply. The amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood is 5.5%, which is greater than that found in land-based mammals and {{is similar to that}} of Weddell seals (a diving marine mammal). One study found a female beluga had 16.5 l of oxygen dissolved in her blood. Lastly, the beluga's muscles contain high levels of the protein myoglobin, which stores oxygen in muscle. Myoglobin concentrations are several times greater than for terrestrial mammals, which help prevent oxygen deficiency during dives.|$|E
