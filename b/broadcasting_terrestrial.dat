40|$|The 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference {{allocated}} the 694 MHz 790 MHz (700 MHz) band to the International Telecommunication Union Region 1, {{which includes}} also Europe, for the mobile service on a co-primary basis with other services {{to which this}} band is allocated on a primary basis, and was identified to the International Mobile Telecommunications. However, countries of Region 1 will {{also be able to}} continue the use of these frequencies for their digital terrestrial television services, if necessary. This allocation will be effective immediately after the 2015 World Radiocommunication Conference. The objective {{of this paper is to}} assess the electromagnetic compatibility of Digital Video <b>Broadcasting</b> - <b>Terrestrial</b> operating below 694 MHz and mobile broadband (LTE) operating in 700 MHz band. The Minimum Coupling Loss method and Monte Carlo simulation within SEAMCAT software was used for interference analysis. An adjacent channel scenario between Digital Video <b>Broadcasting</b> - <b>Terrestrial</b> and LTE was performed to evaluate the impact of Digital Video <b>Broadcasting</b> - <b>Terrestrial</b> on LTE systems. The results obtained provide the minimum coupling distance required between Digital Video <b>Broadcasting</b> - <b>Terrestrial</b> and LTE in the 700 MHz band to maintain the necessary performance level of the LTE system...|$|R

Instead the broadcast can use the channel to include PSIP and can also subdivide across several video subchannels (a.k.a. feeds) of varying quality and compression rates, including non-video datacasting services that allow one-way high-bit-rate streaming of data to computers like National Datacast.|$|E

30|$|There {{are several}} {{standards}} currently used worldwide for digital <b>terrestrial</b> <b>broadcasting</b> [1]. The first introduced was the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC), now used in North America and South Korea. Digital Video <b>Broadcasting</b> - <b>Terrestrial</b> (DVB-T) is the European-based consortium standard, used apart from Europe in Australia, India, {{and some other}} Asian and African countries. The Japanese standard for digital terrestrial television is called Integrated Services Digital <b>Broadcasting</b> - <b>Terrestrial</b> (ISDB-T), adopted after ATSC and DVB-T {{taking into account the}} experience gained with the older standards and it is widely used in South America. Besides those three international standards for digital <b>terrestrial</b> <b>broadcasting,</b> there is also Chinese Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcast standard for fixed and mobile users. Two significant standards for terrestrial mobile TV reception are Terrestrial - Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (T-DMB) and Digital Video Broadcasting - Handheld (DVB-H). The first one was developed in South Korea and its physical parameters are identical to the European Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) standard. T-DMB is being put into use in many countries around the world. On the other side, DVB-H is the preferred technology for <b>terrestrial</b> mobile <b>broadcasting</b> services in Europe.|$|R

GOSL decided to adopt Japanese standard, Integrated Services Digital <b>Broadcasting</b> <b>Terrestrial</b> (ISDB-T) to Digitalize Terrestrial Television Broadcasting in Sri Lanka in order to increase information accessibility for people covering the entire country by promoting the effective utilization of frequency resources. ISDB-T will also develop communication infrastructure by enhancing accessibility to a variety of information including emergency warning broadcasting, road traffic information, weather reports, educational and medical information as well as news and sports as it is the only broadcasting standard that supports reception from mobile phones and mobile devices.|$|E

Alix used the session to urge Brussels (European Union) and all regulators not to ignore terrestrial broadcasting and its importance and value to consumers in the cost-efficient distribution of great programming and information. “People completely underestimate the heavy lifting that broadcast and terrestrial transmission can do. They think the future is mobile broadband, but they underestimate the amount of data we deliver to people’s homes. While we should look at different ways to deliver content, we would be fools not to invest in traditional <b>broadcasting.</b> <b>Terrestrial</b> is an incredibly well established technology and can carry thousands of times more traffic than mobile broadband.” ...|$|E
