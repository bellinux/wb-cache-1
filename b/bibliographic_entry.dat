50|$|Broadly, a {{citation}} is {{a reference}} to a published or unpublished source (not always the original source). More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the <b>bibliographic</b> <b>entry</b> constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not).

Historia del Carlismo was welcome by scholars and the public alike as certified by numerous re-editions, especially that the narrative ended conveniently in 1936 and did not pose {{a challenge to the}} official Francoist propaganda. Until the 1990s it remained the key concise volume on Carlist history, with an alternative offered only by massive and detailed series of Melchor Ferrer, appearing between the early 1940s and the late 1970s. As a primary source of scholarly reference Oyarzun’s synthesis was replaced as late as in the late 20th century, by the 1990-1992 works of Clemente and especially by the 2000 work of Canal.

The links between citing and cited papers became dynamic when the SCI began to be published online.

To {{investigate}} {{the nature of}} hydrophobic collapse {{considered to be the}} driving force in protein folding, we have simulated aqueous solutions of two model hydrophobic solutes, methane and isobutylene. Using a novel methodology for determining contacts, we can precisely follow hydrophobic aggregation as it proceeds through three stages: dispersed, transition, and collapsed. Theoretical modeling of the cluster formation observed by simulation indicates that this aggregation is cooperative and that the simulations favor the formation of a single cluster midway through the transition stage. This defines a minimum solute hydrophobic core volume. We compare this with protein hydrophobic core volumes determined from solved crystal structures. Our analysis shows that the solute core volume roughly estimates the minimum core size required for independent hydrophobic stabilization of a protein and defines a limiting concentration of nonp [...] ...|$|E
