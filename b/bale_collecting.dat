40|$|The <b>bale</b> <b>collecting</b> problem (BCP) appears after harvest {{operations}} in grain and other crops. Its solution defines {{the sequence of}} collecting bales which lie scattered over the field. Current technology on navigation-aid systems or auto-steering for agricultural vehicles and machines, is able to provide accurate data to make a reliable <b>bale</b> <b>collecting</b> planning. This paper presents a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) approach to address the BCP pursuing resource optimization such as minimizing non-productive time, fuel consumption, or distance travelled. The algorithmic route generation provides {{the basis for a}} navigation tool dedicated to loaders and bale wagons. The approach is experimentally tested on a set of instances similar to those found in real situations. In particular, comparative results show an average improving of a 16 % from those obtained by previous heuristics...|$|E
40|$|Large square baling is {{currently}} {{recognized as a}} high efficiency biomass harvesting system. Baling, <b>bale</b> <b>collecting,</b> and storing at a commercial wheat straw farm was studied as a typical large square bale harvesting system. Factors that affect large square bale production and handling logistics were quantified. Field operations of a large square baler, two bale handlers, and three bale trucks were observed in a full day field operation. System performance was analyzed and material capacities of all machines used in this system were determined based on field measurements. System limitations were quantified, and means to increase system efficiency or reduce production costs were discussed. Results showed that 340 wheat straw bales at a density of 116 kg·m- 3 (wet matter) were made with a single large square baler during 8 h field operations. The number of bales produced was the system limitation when one baler, two bale handlers and three bale trucks were used. Adding a baler or {{reduce the number of}} operators can increase system efficiency. The large square baler used in this study had a material capacity of 13 Mg·h- 1 . Similar baling trials were conducted in a switchgrass field and results indicated that the baler had the same material capacity...|$|E

30|$|Samples of forage {{materials}} were harvested from the plots at week 12 growth periods. The material {{was divided into}} three equal portions from each subplot, one portion hand-baled after 1, 2, and 3  days curing periods. The materials (<b>bales)</b> <b>collected</b> each day were stored indoors in an iron sheet-roofed store house with wooden walls. Prior to storage, the moisture content was determined using 50 -g subsamples for each species at the three curing periods, which were oven dried and percent moisture at storage determined. To avoid mix-ups in the store, the experimental {{materials were}} carefully tagged before being stored. To {{determine the effect of}} storage period, experimental material batches from each of the curing treatment levels were sampled at 12, 24, and 36  weeks storage period using core sampling method as described by Rotz and Abrams (1988) and taken for CP analysis following Macro-Kjeldahl Method as describe by Association of Analytical Chemists (AOAC 1990; 2005). All chemical analyses were conducted in three replicates per grass species for all the three curing periods and four storage period at the Department of Animal Production, University of Nairobi.|$|R

40|$|Eighty-nine samples, 45 of {{standing}} forage and 44 of <b>baled</b> hay, were <b>collected</b> from alfalfa harvested at various maturities over three cuttings each during 2 yr. Alfalfa was cut and conditioned mechanically; samples {{of standing}} forage {{were collected by}} removing bunches of forage from windrows and freeze-drying them. Forage was allowed to field cure and was harvested at an average 80 % DM as small rectangular bales; samples of <b>baled</b> hay were <b>collected</b> by coring <b>bales</b> after storing for 3 to 6 mo. Samples were analyzed for DM, ADF, total N, fractions of total N present as ADIN, N degraded at 0 h, and potentially degradable protein N.

2500|$|After leaving college, Bales {{worked as}} a {{stockbroker}} at five financial services firms in Columbus, Ohio. The firms were related, sharing employees and corporate offices. During that period, while employed with Michael Patterson, Inc., Bales and the firm engaged in fraudulent securities activities. An arbitration panel later found both Bales and his employer liable for financial fraud related to the handling of a retirement account and ordered them to pay $1.4 million in civil damages. Gary Liebschner, the victim, said he [...] "never got paid a penny" [...] of the award. According to Liebschner's lawyer, they had not pursued legal action against <b>Bales</b> to <b>collect</b> the judgment because {{they were unable to}} locate Bales, who had joined the U.S. Army 18 months after the long-running arbitration case was filed.|$|R
40|$|Biofouling, the {{accumulation}} of microorganisms, {{is a major problem}} in paper mills processing pa-per and cardboard. This leads to the production of lower quality recycled products. Several stud-ies have focused on the microbial content in the paper mill and the final products. Our aim was to determine the microbial biota in a <b>bale</b> of <b>collected</b> cardboard prior to entering the paper mill. Total genomic DNA was isolated and analyzed using two different methods for comparison pur-poses: 454 pyrosequencing and clone library. A total of 3268 V 6 -V 8 454 pyrosequencing reads and 322 cloned V 6 -V 8 16 S rRNA nucleotide sequences were obtained. Both methods showed the pres-ence of three major bacterial genera: Bacillus, Solibacillus and Paenibacillus, all members of the spore-forming phylum Firmicutes. Pyrosequencing, however, revealed a richer and more diverse bacterial community than clone library. It showed the presence of additional minor Firmicute genera and of a small number of Proteobacteria. The sorting at the recycling plant, the storing, and the processing at the paper mill, the end uses, will all contribute to the bacterial microbiota pre...|$|R
40|$|I’ve {{tried to}} find the most {{effective}} and cost effective way to harvest straw for energy recovery. You can choose between round bales and big square bales. Square bales are the cheapest way to produce straw for fuel recovery because you can optimize the length of the bales so they fit the transportation equipment. In the Malmö area the average days of harvesting hay is 55. The effectively of transportation depends mostly of the speed, the distance and density of the bales. To increase the capacity of bale transportation larger loads and higher density of the bales is necessary. The traffic rules limit the size of the transportation vehicles. Straw is fully storable with a humidity of 18 % but the most straw power plants accepts a humidity of 20 %. The most contract hay harvesting company’s stops baling at a humidity of 19 %. The storage of the bales is first on the field and later on a bigger storage area. There are plenty of systems to choose between when <b>collecting</b> <b>bales</b> from the field to the storage area. The cheapest way for <b>collecting</b> <b>bales</b> from field to the storage area on the field is with a tractor and an automatic bale collector. The system is cheapest because there is only one man required for collecting and stacking. No Wheel loader is nesessary in this system. Handle the straw are expensive. Each time you move a bale the bale-cost rise. It’s important have an effective handling of the bales and reduces the number of times the bales will be removed to lover the cost of bale handling. The wheel loader gets more effective if it’s equipped with a bale squeeze then a bale spear during truck loading. If the baler is equipped with a bale collector you save a lot of time during bale handling, you don’t need to <b>collect</b> the <b>bales</b> with a wheel loader on the whole field because the <b>bales</b> are automatically <b>collected</b> on the field’s turning point. Conclusions: • Big square bales are the cheapest {{and the best way to}} produce hay bales. • Tractor and automatic bale collector are the most economic way to collect a big number of round bales and square bales. • To increase the capacity of bale transportation larger loads and higher density of the bales is necessary. • Balers equipped with cutting section are more expensive than regular balers even when it’s used more hours per yea...|$|R

40|$|Research has {{provided}} clear guidelines {{on how to}} improve baled silage quality and inhibit mould growth. The aim of this survey was to evaluate to what extent these best practice methods have been adopted on commercial farms and to evaluate if these methods improved silage quality. Details of management practices followed during the growing, ensiling and storage of round <b>bale</b> silage were <b>collected,</b> and three <b>bales</b> evaluated on each of 80 farms. Film-wrap seal and bale shape were evaluated and film-wrap samples were taken to determine the number of layers applied. Surface mould cover was visually assessed and silages were sampled for NIRS analysis. Bales with six layers of film-wrap had a more effective film seal compared with bales with four layers (P< 0. 01) and fewer bales showed surface moulding (P< 0. 01) and where present, less surface mould was evident (P< 0. 05). Bales with six layers of film applied had a higher ME and CP concentration when compared to bales wrapped with four layers of film. Bales wrapped by the stack had a better film seal and less surface mould (P< 0. 05) than those wrapped on the harvested field and transported to the stacking area...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequent}} producer-asked questions to those persons striving to secure sustainable corn (Zea mays L.) stover feedstock supplies for Iowa’s new bioenergy conversion or other bio-product facilities is “what quantity of nutrients will be removed if I harvest my stover?” Our objective is to summarize six years of field research from central Iowa, U. S. A. where more than 600, 1. 5 m 2 samples were collected by hand and divided into four plant fractions: vegetative material from the ear shank upward (top), vegetative material from approximately 10 cm above the soil surface to just below the ear (bottom), cobs, and grain. Another 400 stover samples, representing the vegetative material collected directly from a single-pass combine harvesting system or from stover <b>bales</b> were also <b>collected</b> and analyzed. All samples were dried, ground, and analyzed to determine C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Al, B, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn concentrations.

40|$|Timothy {{is grown}} {{as a high}} value forage crop in California. Thrips (Anaphothrips obscurus Müller) have {{recently}} been implicated causing damage by increasing the quantity of brown leaves and lowering {{the value of this}} crop. Minimal studies have explored the relation of thrips levels to yield and damage in timothy and management options for this pest are extremely limited. We performed studies in 2006 - 2008, manipulating thrips levels with disruptive insecticides to establish a hybrid economic injury level (EIL) and provide information on the level of thrips necessary to cause economic loss. Thrips levels were documented and yield and damage was assessed. We also <b>collected</b> <b>bales</b> with varying levels of brown leaves and surveyed growers on the price that they would receive for the bales if it were first or second cutting hay. In all our manipulative experiments, there was a range of thrips levels among treatments and Tetranychid mite levels were flared with cyfluthrin in some experiments. We found no significant impact of thrips or mite levels on yield, but were able to isolate the effect of thrips alone (without mites) on damage in two experiments. The information from these two experiments was combined with the survey data to provide a measure of economic loss based on brown leaf and to establish hybrid EILs. We created EILs for first and second cutting hay prices for methidathion and cyfluthrin. EILs ranged from 19 - 225 accumulated thrips days/tiller. We then created economic thresholds at 75 % the level of the lowest EIL calculated. Economic thresholds ranged from 2 - 24 thrips/tiller/week. In summary, we found that cyfluthrin can significantly flare mites and we created economic thresholds for thrips in timothy that can be used with population information at a single point in time or can be combined with population information over time...|$|R
40|$|Grazing cattle on corn residue as {{a winter}} feed source {{has become an}} {{integral}} part of many Nebraska producers’ management plans. Utilizing corn residues extends the grazing season and is often more economical than grazing winter range or dry lot situations. Corn residue is high in OM and NDF, moderate in digestibility, and low in CP. Cattle grazing corn residues may need to be supplemented with a protein source to meet requirements. The development and application of DNA technology to create new corn hybrids has improved yields with fewer inputs, leading to a continued low cost food supply for consumers. Previous research has demonstrated the safety of transgenic corn, silage, and corn residue as livestock feed sources. In all trials, transgenic corn is nutritionally similar to non-transgenic corn. In the current trial, four treatments were applied to a 53 ha center pivot irrigated field of corn. Treatments included a control, light grazing (2. 5 AUM/ha), heavy grazing (4. 9 AUM/ha), and <b>baling,</b> Samples were <b>collected</b> from all treatment paddocks before and after grazing and analyzed for DM, OM, CP, NDF, IVDMD, and in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD).
