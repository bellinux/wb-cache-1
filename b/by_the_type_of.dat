5|$|The book {{is divided}} into five volumes. Dioscorides {{organized}} the substances by certain similarities, such as their being aromatic, or vines; these divisions do not correspond to any modern classification. In David Sutton's view the grouping is <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> effect on the human body.|$|E
5|$|The innate flavour of {{the dried}} tea leaves is {{determined}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> cultivar {{of the tea}} bush, {{the quality of the}} plucked tea leaves, and the manner and quality of the production processing they undergo. After processing, a tea may be blended with other teas or mixed with flavourants to alter the flavour of the final tea.|$|E
5|$|Breeds {{are often}} {{categorized}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> their wool. Fine wool breeds {{are those that}} have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles. Most of these were derived from Merino sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces. Some major medium wool breeds, such as the Corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American Columbia breed was developed by crossing Lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled Rambouillet ewes.|$|E
40|$|Signs {{and sign}} systems {{constitute}} {{a component of}} regulation and become transformed into system formations organized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> levels of elementary regulation, behavior, and activity; <b>by</b> <b>the</b> aspects of pragmatics, semantics, and syntactics; <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> information-managing systems; and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> external and reflexive regulation. Conviviality problems are regarded as the regulation of human interrelations forming a central domain of regulation in a society...|$|R

5|$|Each {{chromatophore}} contains pigment of {{only one}} colour. In fish and frogs, colour change is mediated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> chromatophores known as melanophores that contain dark pigment. A melanophore is star-shaped; it contains many small pigmented organelles which can be dispersed throughout the cell, or aggregated near its centre. When the pigmented organelles are dispersed, the cell makes a patch of the animal's skin appear dark; when they are aggregated, most of the cell, and the animal's skin, appears light. In frogs, the change is controlled relatively slowly, mainly by hormones. In fish, the change {{is controlled by the}} brain, which sends signals directly to the chromatophores, as well as producing hormones.|$|E
5|$|The Florida {{peninsula}} appeared {{above sea}} level between 100,000 and 150,000years ago. As sea levels rose {{at the end of}} the Wisconsin ice age, the water table appeared closer to land. Lake Okeechobee began to flood and convection thunderstorms were created. Vast peat deposits south of Lake Okeechobee indicate that regular flooding had occurred about 5,000 years ago. Plants began to migrate, subtropical ones from the northern part of Florida, and tropicals carried as seeds by birds from islands in the Caribbean. The limestone shelf appears to be flat, but there are slight rises—called pinnacles—and depressions caused by the erosion of limestone by the acidic properties of the water. The amount of time throughout the year that water is present in a location in the Everglades determines the type of soil, of which there only two in the Everglades: peat, created by many years of decomposing plant matter, and marl, the result of dried periphyton, or chunks of algae and microorganisms that create a grayish mud. Portions of the Everglades that remain flooded for more than nine months out of the year are usually covered by peat. Areas that are flooded six months or less are covered by marl. Plant communities are determined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> soil and amount of water present.|$|E
5|$|The basic garment for all Romans, {{regardless}} of gender or wealth, was the simple sleeved tunic. The length differed by wearer: a man's reached mid-calf, but a soldier's was somewhat shorter; a woman's {{fell to her}} feet, and a child's to its knees. The tunics of poor people and labouring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural, dull shades, with the length determined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> work they did. Finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen. A man who belonged to the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes (clavi) woven vertically into the fabric: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer's status. Other garments could be layered over the tunic.|$|E
