25|$|Success {{was laid}} down by Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney, New South Wales on 9 August 1980. She was {{launched}} on 3 March 1984, and commissioned into the RAN on 23 April 1986. Success is the largest ship to ever be built in Australia for the RAN, and is the largest ship {{to be built in}} Port Jackson (the port of Sydney). She was also the last major vessel to be constructed at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. In June 1983 the contract were renegotiated while construction was underway, with the acceptance date being extended by three years and the project cost increased to $187.3 million. The cost and time overruns were primarily due to protracted dispute between the Commonwealth and the builder over the drawings and specifications received from France, with evidence that the Department of Defence underestimated the extent {{of the differences between the}} original Australian <b>building</b> <b>specifications</b> and those supplied. Additional factors in the time and cost increases were a lack of tradesmen skilled in naval construction, overly bureaucratic management, and low labour productivity. The final project cost was estimated at $197.41 million; the dramatic increase in cost prevented the construction of a planned second ship.|$|E

50|$|Before 1637, {{there are}} no records {{regarding}} <b>building</b> <b>specifications,</b> and the first mention of the make-up of the castle comes during the 17th-century renovation of the structure by Johann Dietrich von Merode-Houffalize. These records detail the castle's numerous structural defects, noting that the buildings were (with {{the exception of the}} Bergfried) without roofs and that many of the walls had collapsed. Makeshift traceries consisting of twigs covered the windows, and numerous beams were rotten. The interior chapel on the second story (like most of the rooms on this floor) could not be entered because of the danger of collapse, which meant that a thorough review of the higher floors was also not possible. Use of the fountain in the main yard of the castle was also impossible because it had filled with rubble.|$|E

40|$|Building {{performance}} simulation (BPS) is {{a powerful}} measure to educate the building design process.

50|$|The DNEF {{allocated}} the locomotives to four of Brazil's state railways. Under Brazilian railway conditions, these modern locomotives {{were not}} popular with local railwaymen {{and were not}} used as much as had been hoped.

In some places the turntables were too short to turn the locomotives {{and they had to}} be turned on triangles. In addition, the <b>building</b> <b>specifications</b> had called for a locomotive capable of a maximum speed of 80 km/h and the ability to negotiate curves with a minimum radius of 80 m.

50|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of using aluminum for mullions {{is that its}} modulus of elasticity is about one-third that of steel. This translates to three times more deflection in an aluminum mullion compared to the same steel section under a given load. <b>Building</b> <b>specifications</b> set deflection limits for perpendicular (wind-induced) and in-plane (dead load-induced) deflections. It {{is important to note}} that these deflection limits are not imposed due to strength capacities of the mullions. Rather, they are designed to limit deflection of the glass (which may break under excessive deflection), and to ensure that the glass does not come out of its pocket in the mullion. Deflection limits are also necessary to control movement at the interior of the curtain wall. Building construction may be such that there is a wall located near the mullion, and excessive deflection can cause the mullion to contact the wall and cause damage. Also, if deflection of a wall is quite noticeable, public perception may raise undue concern that the wall is not strong enough.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Building Performance Simulation (BPS) is a {{powerful}} measure to educate the building design process. However, its use in practice is too large extents limited to the detailed design stage dedicated to the code compliance analysis of worked out design proposals. BPS is not much used to support the conceptual design stage. To date BPS – tools are regarded as pure analysis tools, which do not provide design information. It is hypothesized that, when integrating uncertainty analysis techniques to existing BPS – tools, following an incremental research approach, valuable design information can be provided. The paper gives {{an update on the}} process to extend the capabilities of a tool specifically developed to support the conceptual design stage about uncertainty assessment. The resulting prototype should be capable of providing information about the variation of specific building performance metrics (simulation output) based on the propagated uncertainties of the <b>building</b> <b>specification</b> (simulation input). The results also indicate the degree of impact, sensitivity, of the <b>building</b> <b>specification</b> parameters on the variation of the performance metrics {{as a result of their}} uncertainty. This paper describes an approach to add extra-capabilities to legacy simulation tools and presents a comparison of uncertainties and sensitivities calculated with one detailed design analysis tool, IES, and one conceptual design analysis tool, LEA.

The hall was lit by kerosene pendant lamps which were replaced with gas lighting in late 1892 or early 1893, for which task the hall's architect AB Wilson was consulted. In about November 1894, alterations were made to the front of the hall, again to Wilson's specifications. The shop-front windows were removed and replaced with the present sash windows, the gallery floor was altered, a girder was placed at the front of the gallery platform and a new stairway to the gallery was constructed in the north-western corner of the hall of material from the previous gallery stairs. The internal walls under the gallery were altered suggesting a change in the configuration of the rooms at the front of the hall. The front and vestibule doors were rehung closer to the front wall. The caretakers' residence was eventually moved underneath the hall to a four-roomed basement apartment which still exists.|$|E

40|$|This paper conceptualizes a {{framework}} for bridging the BIM-Specifications divide by embedding project-specific information in BIM objects {{by means of a}} product library.
