5|$|The Underground State {{also became}} officially {{recognized}} by the Polish government, local authorities and the community, with most major cities in Poland erecting various memorials to the Underground State affiliated resistance. In Poznań, there is a dedicated Polish Underground State Monument, erected in 2007.

5|$|As {{with any}} non-repeating calendar, the Maya {{measured}} time from a fixed start point. The Maya set {{the beginning of}} their calendar as the end of a previous cycle of bak'tuns, equivalent to a day in 3114 BC. This was believed by the Maya to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of the creation of the world in its current form. The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great Piktun cycle consisting of either 20 bak'tuns. There was some variation in the calendar, specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the piktun cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13 bak'tuns, and other inscriptions seem to have used an exceptional cycle of 13 + 20 bak'tun in the current piktun. Additionally, there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{the drummer}} landed several acting roles. His first was in 1971, a cameo in Frank Zappa's 200 Motels as a nun afraid {{of dying from}} a drug overdose. Although it only took 13 days to film, fellow cast member Howard Kaylan remembers Moon {{spending}} off-camera time at the Kensington Garden Hotel bar instead of sleeping. Moon's next film role was J.D. Clover, drummer for the fictional Stray Cats at a holiday camp during {{the early days of}} British rock 'n' roll, in 1973's That'll <b>Be</b> <b>the</b> <b>Day.</b> He reprised the role for the film's 1974 sequel, Stardust, and played Uncle Ernie in Ken Russell's 1975 film adaptation of Tommy. Moon's last film appearance was in 1978's Sextette with Starr and Alice Cooper. This was the last film to star Mae West.|$|E

25|$|After this, {{there was}} also a problem with the scheduling, as City were due to play Liga Argentina on the 28th and a game in Rosario on the 29th. However, the Rosario League Committee had not been {{consulted}} and refused to accept the arrangements, resenting the fact that their game would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> after one of the main fixtures of the tour and claiming that City {{would not be able to}} produce their best form. The games were rescheduled, with the Rosario game now being played on the 28th, a less important scratch XI on the 29th and the Liga Argentina game was postponed to the 9 July.|$|E
25|$|When {{the list}} is compiled, the {{material}} day is the day {{the list is}} compiled (1 April 2005 for the 2005 valuation list). If the list is further altered, the material day may be different for that alteration. For example, in the 2005 rating list the material day for an alteration to reflect an extension to a property will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> the extension is completed. Previously the material day for an extension had been the day on which the list was altered. There {{are a number of}} different categories of events which cause the list to be altered (such as a new entry to the list, or the merger of properties), each of which has a specified material day. Most commonly the material day is the day the event occurred.|$|E
25|$|The civil {{calendar}} in Iran since 31 March AD 1925 {{has been}} the Solar Hejri calendar. This is strictly tied to the actual northward equinox, rather than a mathematical approximation to it. An Iranian day is reckoned to begin at midnight. Iranian time is 3.5 hours ahead of GMT. New Year's Day is defined to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> as reckoned by Iranian time, when the northward equinox (the precise moment in time when northern and southern hemispheres of the earth pass through {{the point of the}} earth's orbit when they are equally illuminated by the sun) occurs on or before noon of that day, or during the 12 hours following the noon of the preceding day. This means that the pattern of leap years in the Iranian calendar is complex – usually following a 33-year cycle where the leap day is inserted every fourth year, but in year 33 instead of year 32, but with occasional 29 - year cycles.|$|E

25|$|Juliet {{catches her}} mother {{having an affair}} with one of her {{psychiatric}} clients and threatens to tell her father, but her mother tells her he knows. Shortly afterward, the two announce their intention to divorce, upsetting Juliet. Soon it is decided that the family will leave Christchurch, with Juliet to be left with a relative in South Africa. She becomes increasingly hysterical at the thought of leaving Pauline, and the two girls plan to run away together. When that plan becomes impossible, the two begin to talk about murdering Pauline's mother as they see her as the primary obstacle to their being together. As the date of Juliet's departure nears, it is decided that the two girls should spend the last three weeks together at Juliet's house. At the end of that time, Pauline returns home and the two finalize plans for the murder. Honora plans a day for the three of them at Victoria Park, and the girls decide this will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> Juliet puts a broken piece of brick into a stocking and they go off to the park. After having tea, the three walk down the path and when Honora bends over to pick up a pink charm the girls have put there, Juliet and Pauline bludgeon her to death.|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} Alves fight, Hughes {{stated that he}} had [...] "one more fight" [...] left in him, and {{that he wanted to}} fight Matt Serra. Their rivalry stemmed from the time when Serra was a {{contestant}} on The Ultimate Fighter and Hughes was guest coach. Serra did not like the way Hughes criticized other contestants on the show and was disgusted when Hughes constantly picked on Georges St-Pierre during a lunch break and bragged about his submission victory.

500|$|Apple Records {{released}} Living in the Material World on 30 May 1973 in America. [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" [...] was sequenced on side {{one of the}} LP, {{between the}} ballads [...] "The Light That Has Lighted the World" [...] and [...] "Who Can See It". The album continued Harrison's run of commercial success following the Beatles' break-up in 1970, topping Billboards albums chart in the US and peaking at number 2 in Britain, behind the soundtrack to That'll <b>Be</b> <b>the</b> <b>Day.</b> Amid this success, Rodriguez writes, Harrison and Boyd's relationship [...] "finally reached breaking point" [...] in summer 1973, {{the start of a}} period through to 1975 that Harrison would describe as his [...] "naughty" [...] years.|$|E
500|$|Starr has {{received}} praise from critics and movie industry professionals regarding his acting; director and producer Walter Shenson called him [...] "a superb actor, an absolute natural". By the mid-1960s, Starr {{had become a}} connoisseur of film. In addition to his roles in A Hard Day's Night (1964), Help! (1965), Magical Mystery Tour (1967) and Let It Be (1970), Starr also acted in Candy (1968), The Magic Christian (1969), Blindman (1971), Son of Dracula (1974) and Caveman (1981). In 1971, he starred as Larry the Dwarf in Frank Zappa's 200 Motels and was featured in Harry Nilsson's animated film The Point! He co-starred in That'll <b>Be</b> <b>the</b> <b>Day</b> (1973) as a Teddy Boy and appeared in The Last Waltz, the Martin Scorsese documentary film about the 1976 farewell concert of the Band.|$|E
500|$|Fletcher {{argues that}} The Who's lengthy break {{between the end}} of their 1972 European tour and the {{beginning}} of the Quadrophenia sessions devastated Moon's health, as without the rigours of lengthy shows and regular touring that had previously kept him in shape, his hard-partying lifestyle took a greater toll on his body. He did not keep a drum kit or practice at Tara, and began to deteriorate physically as a result of his lifestyle. Around the same time he became a severe alcoholic, starting the day with drinks and changing from the [...] "lovable boozer" [...] he presented himself as to a [...] "boorish drunk". David Puttnam recalled, [...] "The drinking went from being a joke to being a problem. On That'll <b>Be</b> <b>the</b> <b>Day</b> it was social drinking.

500|$|Aside from Harrison on {{acoustic}} guitars, {{the musicians}} {{on the basic}} track for [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" [...] were Nicky Hopkins (piano), Wright (keyboards), Voormann (bass), and Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner (both on drums). The Starr–Keltner combination followed their pairing at the Concert for Bangladesh shows; this song {{was one of three}} tracks on Material World to which Starr contributed, in between his film work on That'll <b>Be</b> <b>the</b> <b>Day</b> and Son of Dracula. In addition, Pete Ham and Tom Evans of the Apple group Badfinger attended some of the sessions in October, playing acoustic rhythm guitar as they had on much of All Things Must Pass. As with Ham's playing on the 1971-recorded [...] "Try Some, Buy Some", however, any contribution they might have made to [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" [...] went uncredited on the official release.|$|E
500|$|Townshend became {{inspired}} by [...] "Long Live Rock – Rock Is Dead"'s theme and in autumn 1972 began writing material, while the group put out unreleased recordings including [...] "Join Together" [...] and [...] "Relay" [...] to keep {{themselves in the}} public eye. In the meantime, bassist John Entwistle released his second solo album, Whistle Rymes, singer Roger Daltrey worked on solo material, and Keith Moon featured as a drummer in the film That'll <b>Be</b> <b>The</b> <b>Day.</b> Townshend had met up with [...] "Irish" [...] Jack Lyons, {{one of the original}} Who fans, which gave him the idea of writing a piece that would look back on the group's history and its audience. He created the character of Jimmy from an amalgamation of six early fans of the group, including Lyons, and gave the character a four-way split personality, which led to the album's title (a play on schizophrenia).|$|E
500|$|Living in the Material World {{was issued}} on 30 May 1973 in America (with Apple {{catalogue}} number SMAS 3410) and on 22 June in Britain (as Apple PAS 10006).

Material World spent five weeks atop the US charts, having been awarded a gold disc by the RIAA within two days of release, for advance orders. In the UK, the album peaked at number 2, held from the top position by the soundtrack to Starr's movie That'll <b>Be</b> <b>the</b> <b>Day.</b> Despite high sales initially, its follow-on success was limited by what Leng terms the [...] "anomalous" [...] decision to cancel {{the release of a}} second US single, [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long".|$|E
