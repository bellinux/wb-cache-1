Setting out from Bahia, Brazil, the gunboat visited Spanish and Italian ports during the 400thanniversary celebration of Columbus' voyage to the western hemisphere. She concluded the European portion of those festivities on 18 February 1893 when she departed Cadiz, with a replica of Columbus’s caravel Pinta in tow for Cuba. After stops in the Canary Islands, the Netherlands West Indies, and Havana, the gunboat arrived <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> at Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 26 March.|$|E

During this year, she also saw a refit in Norfolk Navy Yard where five 5-inch guns were removed and three additional 3-inch/50 caliber AA guns were added, bringing the total to five. The secondary battery was reduced to sixteen 5-inch/51 caliber guns. In late 1919, she sailed to the Pacific Ocean and joined the newly formed United States Pacific Fleet. She continued to conduct training and patrol duties in the Pacific until the mid-1930s when she was transferred again to the Atlantic, and began operating out of the North Atlantic, with the exception of several occasional trips to the West Coast of the United States.|$|E
5|$|When Cope arrived <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> {{after his}} tour of Europe in 1878, he had {{nearly two years}} of fossil {{findings}} from Lucas. Among these dinosaurs was Camarasaurus, {{one of the most}} recognizable dinosaur recreations of the time. The summer of 1879 took Cope to Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and north to Oregon, where he was amazed at the rich flora and the blueness of the Pacific Ocean. In 1879, the United States Congress consolidated the various government survey teams into the United States Geological Survey with Clarence King as its leader. This was discouraging to Cope because King named Marsh, an old college friend, as the chief paleontologist. The period of Cope's and Marsh's paleontological digs in the American West spanned from 1877 to 1892, by which time both men exhausted much of their financial resources.|$|E

He toured Hampton Normal and Agricultural School, and shopped for horses in Kentucky. The royal party boarded a train to California, where they were house guests of Claus Spreckels at his estate in Aptos (near Santa Cruz), and had {{a few days of}} seeing the sights in the area before sailing back to Hawaii.

25|$|Blackwell {{made several}} trips back to Britain {{to raise funds}} {{and to try to}} {{establish}} a parallel infirmary project there. In 1858, under a clause in the Medical Act of 1858 that recognised doctors with foreign degrees practicing in Britain before 1858, she was able to become the first woman to have her name entered on the General Medical Council's medical register (1 January 1859). She also became a mentor to Elizabeth Garrett Anderson during this time. By 1866, nearly 7,000 patients were being treated per year at the New York Infirmary, and Blackwell was needed <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> The parallel project fell through, but in 1868, a medical college for women adjunct to the infirmary was established.

25|$|Prior to the mission, {{the crews}} were briefed that {{a minimum of}} 2000-3000 (possibly as high as 6000 or more) North Vietnamese regular army troops were encamped in the target area. To ensure security, it was planned that the raid would be carried out in {{complete}} radio silence from beginning to end. The raid did not start off well, as {{on the way to}} the target, two B-52Fs collided in midair during a refueling operation and 8 crew members were killed. An investigation later blamed the cause for the mid-air collision on a combination of poor staff planning, extremely unusual and unique weather conditions, forbidden radio communications and an untested air refueling operation. The next day, the press <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> generally derided the raid as being an expensive and costly failure, and it was claimed that only one water buffalo was killed and only 100 pounds of rice were destroyed.|$|E

Now a major, he {{returned}} to the War College Division in July 1915. He found that there was a general apathy about intelligence-gathering, and the MID had been downgraded from the second division of the General Staff, and merged with the third division, ending its separate identity. Van Deman wrote a history of MID detailing its beginnings in 1885, its rise in 1903, and fall in subsequent years. He was convinced that the Army must have a coordinated intelligence organization if it were to avoid defeat in the near future, especially as it was now obvious that the U.S. would soon be involved in the war in Europe. Eventually Van Deman was able to get an audience with the Secretary of War to present his case. There he convinced the War Department to accept his idea of an intelligence department for U.S. forces. A crucial role was played by Colonel Claude Dansey of the British Security Service in proposing similar ideas to Colonel Edward M. House, a member of an American liaison mission to Britain and one of President Wilson's advisors.|$|E
