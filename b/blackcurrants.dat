5|$|<b>Blackcurrants</b> {{can grow}} well on sandy or heavy loams, or forest soils, {{as long as}} their {{nutrient}} requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought. Although the bushes are winter hardy, frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A pH of about 6 is ideal for <b>blackcurrants</b> and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can be planted at any time of year.|$|E
5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done mechanically by straddle harvesters. These move continually down the rows, straddling {{a row of}} bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The <b>blackcurrants</b> are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of <b>blackcurrants</b> in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a cool place. Some fruit is still picked by hand {{for use in the}} fresh fruit market.|$|E
5|$|American {{gooseberry}} mildew and {{powdery mildew}} can infect {{the leaves and}} shoot tips, and botrytis may cause the fruit to rot in a wet season. Currant and gooseberry leaf spot (Drepanopeziza ribis) is another disease of <b>blackcurrants,</b> {{but it is not}} usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance.|$|E
50|$|It is {{commonly}} known as the <b>blackcurrant</b> gall mite or big bud mite. It feeds on the plants' buds, forms galls, and transmits a virus which causes <b>blackcurrant</b> reversion disease. The mite is a serious pest of <b>blackcurrant</b> crops in Europe, but rarely on other continents.|$|R

5|$|Burgundy and Franche-Comté {{are known}} for their wines. Pike, perch, river crabs, snails, game, redcurrants, <b>blackcurrants</b> are from both Burgundy and Franche-Comté. Amongst savorous {{specialties}} accounted in the Cuisine franc-comtoise from the Franche-Comté region are Croûte aux morilles, Poulet à la Comtoise, trout, smoked meats and cheeses such as Mont d'Or, Comté and Morbier which are at the palate best eaten hot or cold, the exquisite Coq au vin jaune and the special dessert gâteau de ménage. Charolais beef, poultry from Bresse, sea snail, honey cake, Chaource and Epoisses cheese are specialties of the local cuisine of Burgundy. Dijon mustard is also a specialty of Burgundy cuisine. Crème de cassis is a popular liquor made from the <b>blackcurrants.</b> Oil are used in the cooking here, types include nut oils and rapeseed oil.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit of}} <b>blackcurrants</b> can be eaten raw, {{but it has}} a strong, tart flavour. It can be made into jams and jellies which set readily because of the fruit's high content of pectin and acid. For culinary use, the fruit is usually cooked with sugar to produce a purée, which can then be passed through muslin to {{separate}} the juice. The purée {{can be used to make}} blackcurrant preserves and be included in cheesecakes, yogurt, ice cream, desserts, sorbets and many other sweet dishes. The exceptionally strong flavour can be moderated by combining it with other fruits, such as raspberries and strawberries in summer pudding, or apples in crumbles and pies. The juice can be used in syrups and cordials. <b>Blackcurrants</b> are a common ingredient of Rødgrød, a popular kissel-like dessert in North German and Danish cuisines.|$|E
5|$|The juice {{forms the}} basis for various popular cordials, juice drinks, juices and smoothies.

5|$|<b>Blackcurrants</b> {{are also}} used in savoury cooking because their {{astringency}} creates added flavour in many sauces, meat and other dishes and they are included in some unusual combinations of foods. They {{can be added to}} tomato and mint to make a salad, used to accompany roast or grilled lamb, used to accompany seafood and shellfish, used as a dipping sauce at barbecues, blended with mayonnaise, used to invigorate bananas and other tropical fruits, combined with dark chocolate or added to mincemeat in traditional mince pies at Christmas.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blackcurrants</b> {{were once}} {{popular in the}} United States as well, but became less common in the 20th century after currant farming was banned in the early 1900s, when <b>blackcurrants,</b> as a vector of white pine blister rust, were {{considered}} {{a threat to the}} U.S. logging industry. The federal ban on growing currants was shifted to jurisdiction of individual states in 1966, and was lifted in New York State in 2003 through the efforts of horticulturist Greg Quinn. As a result, currant growing is making a comeback in New York, Vermont, Connecticut and Oregon. However, several statewide bans still exist including Maine, New Hampshire, Virginia, Ohio, and Massachusetts. Since the American federal ban curtailed currant production nationally for nearly a century, the fruit remains largely unknown in the United States, and has yet to regain its previous popularity to levels enjoyed in Europe or New Zealand. Owing to its unique flavour and richness in polyphenols, dietary fibre and essential nutrients, awareness and popularity of blackcurrant is once again growing, with a number of consumer products entering the U.S. market.|$|E
5|$|In Russia, {{blackcurrant}} leaves may be {{used for}} flavouring tea or preserves, such as salted cucumbers, and berries for home winemaking. Sweetened vodka may also be infused with blackcurrant leaves making a deep greenish-yellow beverage with a tart flavour and astringent taste. The berries may be infused in a similar manner. In Britain, 95% of the <b>blackcurrants</b> grown end up in Ribena (a brand of fruit juice whose name is derived from Ribes nigrum) and similar fruit syrups and juices.|$|E

5|$|The {{style of}} Cabernet Sauvignon is {{strongly}} influenced by the ripeness of the grapes at harvest. When more on the unripe side, the grapes are high in pyrazines and will exhibit pronounced green bell peppers and vegetal flavors. When harvested overripe the wines can taste jammy and may have aromas of stewed <b>blackcurrants.</b> Some winemakers choose to harvest their grapes at different ripeness levels in order to incorporate these different elements and potentially add some layer of complexity to the wine. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, the wines typically exhibit strong fruit flavors of black cherries and plum. The aroma of <b>blackcurrants</b> {{is one of the}} most distinctive and characteristic element of Cabernet Sauvignon that is present in virtually every style of the wine across the globe. Styles from various regions and producers may also have aromas of eucalyptus, mint and tobacco. As the wines age they can sometimes develop aromas associated with cedar, cigar boxes and pencil shavings. In general New World examples have more pronounced fruity notes while Old World wines can be more austere with heightened earthy notes.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, most fruits rich in vitamin C, such as oranges, became {{difficult}} to obtain in the United Kingdom. Since blackcurrant berries are {{a rich source of}} the vitamin and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the UK climate, the British Government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation's crop increased significantly. From 1942 onwards, blackcurrant syrup was distributed free of charge to {{children under the age of}} two, and this may have given rise to the lasting popularity of blackcurrant as a flavouring in Britain. In Britain the commercial crop is completely mechanised and about 1,400 hectares of the fruit are grown, mostly under contract to the juicing industry. Commercially, most large-scale cultivation of <b>blackcurrants</b> is done in eastern Europe for the juice and juice concentrate market.|$|E
5|$|Fruit in <b>blackcurrants</b> {{is borne}} {{primarily}} on one-year-old shoots. Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely, cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level. This gives the plant {{a chance to}} get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit. The general rule when pruning is to remove all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting. The remaining branches should be thinned so as to remove old unproductive wood and encourage new shoots. An established bush {{should not be allowed to}} become overcrowded and should have about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year. When harvesting by machine, plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged.|$|E
40|$|A strong <b>blackcurrant</b> aroma was {{recently}} perceived in some red wines originating {{from the same}} appellation. Varietal thiols such as 4 -mercapto- 4 -methyl- 2 -pentanone (4 MMP), 3 -(mercapto) hexyl acetate (3 MHA) and 3 -mercapto- 1 -hexanol (3 MH) are compounds potentially responsible {{for the development of}} this aroma. In order to demonstrate the correlation between thiols concentrations in red wines and <b>blackcurrant</b> aroma intensity, a multiple variable analysis was realised with thiols concentrations obtained by chemical analysis and <b>blackcurrant</b> aroma intensities obtained by descriptive sensory analysis. The 4 MMP concentration was very well correlated to the <b>blackcurrant</b> aroma, and 3 MHA and 3 MH present at high concentrations act as enhancers of the perception of this aroma. This correlation was further supported after performing a sensory comparison by classification test. The different factors that could impact on the development of <b>blackcurrant</b> aroma in red wine were discussed...|$|R

5|$|While Cabernet Sauvignon {{can grow}} {{in a variety}} of climates, its {{suitability}} as a varietal wine or as a blend component is strongly influenced by the warmth of the climate. The vine {{is one of the last}} major grape varieties to bud and ripen (typically 1–2 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet franc) and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give the vine an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which increases the likelihood of producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier than ideal and is then blended with other grapes to fill in the gaps. In some regions, climate will be more important than soil. In regions that are too cool, there is a potential for more herbaceous and green bell pepper flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess warmth and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours of cooked or stewed <b>blackcurrants.</b>|$|E
25|$|Extra jam {{is subject}} to {{somewhat}} stricter rules that set higher standards for the minimum fruit content (45% instead of 35% as a general rule, but lower for some fruits such as redcurrants and <b>blackcurrants),</b> as well specifying {{as the use of}} unconcentrated fruit pulp, and forbidding the mixture of certain fruits and vegetables with others.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{detrimental}} effects of mild winter temperatures on {{the consistency of}} cropping of <b>blackcurrant</b> (Ribes nigrum L.) in parts of Europe have led to increasing interest in the genetic control of dormancy release in this species. This study examined patterns of gene expression in leaf buds of <b>blackcurrant</b> to identify key differential changes in these profiles {{around the time of}} budbreak. Results: Using leaf bud tissue of <b>blackcurrant,</b> a cDNA library was generated as a source of <b>blackcurrant</b> ESTs for construction of a custom microarray, which was used to identify differential gene expression during dormancy release. Gene activity was lowest in early stages of dormancy, increasing to reach a maximum around the time of budbreak. Genes with significantly changing expression profiles were clustered and evidence is provided for the transient activity of genes previously associated with dormancy processes in other species. Expression profiling identified candidate genes which were mapped onto a <b>blackcurrant</b> genetic linkage map containing budbreakrelated QTL. Three genes, which putatively encode calmodulin-binding protein, beta tubulin and acetyl CoA carboxylase respectively, were found to co-localise with budbreak QTL. Conclusions: This study provides insight into the genetic control of dormancy transition in <b>blackcurrant,</b> identifying key changes in gene expression around budbreak. Genetic mapping of ESTs enabled the identification of genes which co-localise with previously-characterised <b>blackcurrant</b> QTL, and it is concluded that these genes have probable roles in release of dormancy and can therefore provide a basis for the development of genetic markers for future breeding deployment...|$|R
