5|$|In a 1988 TV special, series creator Gene Roddenberry said that, as {{with the}} first pilot, this one still {{had a lot of}} science-fiction {{elements}} in it, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it</b> ended with Kirk in a bare-knuckle fistfight with Mitchell and that's what sold NBC on Star Trek.|$|E
500|$|... "Papa Don't Preach" [...] is {{a message}} song that {{everyone}} is going to take the wrong way. Immediately they're going to say I am advising every young girl {{to go out and get}} pregnant. When I first heard the song, I thought it was silly. But then I thought, wait a minute, this song is really about a girl who is making a decision in her life. She has a very close relationship with her father and wants to maintain that closeness. To me it's a celebration of life. It says, 'I love you, father, and I love this man and this child that is growing inside me'. Of course, who knows how it will end? <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it</b> starts off positive." ...|$|E
500|$|Len Jones as Joe McClaine, {{a nine-year-old}} adoptee who {{balances}} schoolwork with missions {{as a spy}} for the World Intelligence Network (WIN), using the aid of knowledge and experience captured by a brilliant invention, the Brain Impulse [...] Record And Transfer (BIG RAT). For realism, Joe is voiced by child actor Jones rather than an actress as had usually been {{the case for the}} representation of younger characters on earlier Supermarionation series. On the subject of female casting, Gerry Anderson recalled, [...] "...it always sounded rather odd to me. It never sounded like a real little boy... With Joe 90, I suggested finding a British kid and making him repeat the lines parrot fashion. That's what we did with Len Jones. His performance was only adequate, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it</b> sounded authentic." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{film was}} not well {{received}} by critics. Adam-Troy Castro in Sci Fi Weekly described the work as [...] "a not-very-interesting alien invasion fought by a not-very-interesting hero and not-very-interesting heroine." [...] Leah Holmes from SFX magazine gave it 1.5/5, saying [...] "It's stupid and nonsensical, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it's</b> funny" [...] and George Tiller of PopMatters gave it just 1/10.|$|R
5000|$|Publishers Weekly gave a {{positive}} review for the book, praising {{the character of}} America. The School Library Journal, MTV, and Booklist all gave positive reviews for The Selection [...] while in contrast, Kirkus Reviews panned the novel. The A.V. Club gave a mostly positive review, commenting that it [...] "is something of a Hunger Games rip-off, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it’s</b> an entertaining one".|$|R
500|$|Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy {{awarded the}} story {{four out of}} five stars, writing that it flowed better than Cross' last episode, [...] "The Rings of Akhaten", and allowed for the {{exploration}} of several themes. While he was positive towards the way the story was tied back to a time traveller, he felt that the ending was [...] "perhaps less interesting than what's come before, simply because it feels more familiar", though it was still [...] "solid". IGN's Mark Snow gave the episode a score of 8.4 out of 10. He praised the smaller scope and focus on character, but wrote [...] "the left-field genre detour didn't completely convince, and felt jarringly underwhelming considering the spooky set-up, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it</b> tried something unique". Jordan Farley of SFX gave [...] "Hide" [...] {{four out of five}} stars. Farley felt that the science fiction element left too many answers, but said that it excelled as a love story.|$|E
500|$|... {{utterance}} of 'you're my James Dean / {{you make}} me feel like I'm seventeen' on 'Rather Die Young' is made tolerable by her honeyed vocal slides. Certainly, the 'bad boy' Beyoncé is in love with is more a physical representation of countless painfully banal fantasies about guys who 'drive too fast' and 'smoke too much' than an actual person, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it</b> feels tangible. For once, the pop song trying to make a connection with its listener doesn't feel like a total fraud. Forget Lady Gaga's song about her relationship with her father or Britney Spears' lullaby to her babies – here, I'm convinced, if only for a moment, that Beyoncé really would rather die young than to live her life without her lover, that she cares, even if you don't. This doesn't fully explain why 4 is as enjoyable as it is, but it does convey just how convincing Beyoncé can be when given the right tools – {{and it turns out that}} those tools consist of not much more than Beyoncé's voice itself.|$|E
500|$|With little {{progress}} made on securing a high-profile candidate, Committee working groups held interviews. Of the eight men who applied, {{the most prominent}} was former congressman John Hoeppel, who promised to keep [...] "the Jews and the niggers" [...] out of the district. [...] On October 6, 1945, the Monrovia News Post reported that while Dexter seemed the likely candidate, [...] "of course anything can happen in politics and generally does". [...] The News Post stated that other names discussed by the Committee included [...] "Lt. [...] Richard Nixon, U.S.N.R., of Whittier." [...] Congressman Voorhis wrote his father and political adviser, Charles Voorhis, on October 15, [...] "I understand the General {{has decided not to}} run in the 12th district. [...] Dr. Dexter would, in my opinion, be hard to beat. [...] <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it</b> would be a clean, decent campaign, and I'm not so sure I wouldn't prefer that even if I lost." [...] Herman Perry, Whittier Bank of America branch manager and Nixon family friend, wrote to Nixon, who was then a lieutenant commander in the Navy, telling him he should apply for the Committee's endorsement. [...] Nixon replied enthusiastically. [...] When Dexter finally turned the Committee down, he recommended Nixon, his onetime student. [...] Dexter died only days later of a heart attack, and Patton died in an auto accident before the 1946 campaign began.|$|E

5000|$|Kaori is a tsundere who can't {{be honest}} about her deep love for Amane. She lives next door to Amane and goes to Saint Michael's Girls Academy together. Very {{responsible}} and straightforward. She fulfills the tsukkomi role very well. However, when Amane's repeated loving advances breaks down her tsundere wall, she becomes very cute and doting. She's not that good <b>at</b> cooking, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it's</b> better than Amane.|$|R
5000|$|Sarah Maines from The TV Chick {{stated that}} the episode {{continued}} the show’s streak of improved episodes. [...] "Secret Circle isn’t perfect, {{but over the past}} 5 or 6 episodes the show has found a nice groove and was able to course correct some of the major problems with {{the first half of the}} season. It’s a shame that next week’s episode will probably be its last, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it’s</b> going out on top!" ...|$|R
500|$|Rob Salem of Toronto Star {{said that}} [...] "fans {{who have been}} {{complaining}} about this season’s relative complacency [...] finally got their gore and more when the farm was overrun by suddenly, strangely single-minded walkers." [...] Pamela Mitchell of Houston Chronicle commented that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] was the most eventful episode of the season, while Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery thought that [...] "every single major character gets their moment to shine"; [...] "Epic, action-packed, emotional—'Beside the Dying Fire' is great television," [...] she concluded. TV Guide television critic Michael Logan affirmed that the season finale [...] "was so scary and shock-a-minute outrageous that it nearly made our heads explode." [...] In his A– review, Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club said that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] adequately accomplished what he was hoping for. He wrote, [...] "We're finally off Hershel's farm, in about the most definitive way imaginable: The barn has been burned, and the house itself is overrun by a herd of 'walkers'." [...] New York Starlee Kine adulated the installment, and asserted that it was comparable to episodes of The Walking Dead first season. [...] "It’s just amazing how much smoother the plot holes go down when something is actually happening on this show. For {{the first time since}} last season, I felt engrossed enough to not be consumed with all the small things this show gets wrong. Up until this episode, the majority of this season has consisted exclusively of small things: petty dramas, misdirected stakes, so much stalling. I’m not sure I can {{go so far as to}} say that it got everything right with this one, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it</b> was entertaining and the nonstop action felt like content instead of just bookends." [...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald wrote that it was the closest the program [...] "ever resembled the climax of a George Romero film." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings felt that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] sufficiently encompassed a climax for its storylines, adding that it left the audience anticipating for future installments of the series.|$|E
2500|$|With the 500,000 francs {{that have}} been laid out for this valueless {{distinction}} we might instead have given the médaille militaire {{to three or four}} hundred brave men and done them true honour. [...] That would have been little enough, and far less than their deeds deserved, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it</b> would have been better than nothing. [...] But the commemorative medal is nothing. [...] Indeed, it is less than nothing, worse than nothing. [...] It is a manifestation of that absurd species of egalitarianism which insists on cutting down the great to the same level as the small and rewarding equally those who exceeded their duty and those who shirked it.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson's {{representative}} {{explained the}} incident, saying, [...] "Justin {{was supposed to}} pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra. The garment collapsed and her breast was accidentally revealed." [...] CBS forced Jackson to release a video apology, and said [...] "My decision to change the Super Bowl performance was made after the final rehearsal. MTV, CBS, [...] the NFL {{had no knowledge of}} this whatsoever and unfortunately, the whole thing went wrong in the end. I am really sorry if I offended anyone, that was truly not my intention". Jackson later commented, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident" [...] when the statement was replayed in the media. A written statement read, [...] "The decision to have a costume reveal {{at the end of my}} halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals. MTV was completely unaware of it. It was not my intention that it go as far as it did. I apologize to anyone offended – including the audience, MTV, CBS and the NFL." [...] Due to the event being accidental and unintentional, Jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this. Speaking to USA Today, Jackson said, [...] "It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [...] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ... but there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand." [...] Regarding continued backlash, she responded, [...] "Who knows...Maybe they'll get mad at something that I do in my show, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it</b> won't be new to me, since I've already gone through all of this. But I feel very positive that things are going to work out just fine. Everything happens for a reason." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Hollywood Reporter panned Teen Lust, {{writing that}} it was [...] "Uneven as a {{straightforward}} comedy and never pointed enough as a send-up of religion or sexuality." [...] Fangoria was more positive in their review and gave the film {{two and a half}} out of four skulls, as they felt that the movie did have [...] "a few big laughs and a great premise" [...] and that [...] "It might be a missed opportunity, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it’s</b> not a blown one." ...|$|R
500|$|Alice in Chains toured {{extensively}} in the U.S., Canada, and Europe in 2013 and 2014. In May 2013, the band co-headlined the annual MMRBQ festival with Soundgarden in Camden, New Jersey. Asked in September 2013 if Alice in Chains would make another album, Cantrell replied, [...] "It'll be a while. It's [...] four years since we put the last one out, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it's</b> not the gap that was between the last one, so that's about right - about three to four years." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{his review}} of issue #3, Paul O'Brien {{described}} the series as [...] "one {{of the best things}} to come out of Reload". In {{his review of}} 2004, O'Brien noted that [...] "X has not been a complete creative success, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it's</b> been trying". However, O'Brien was less favourable to later issues of the series; in his review of District X in 2005, he noted that [...] "ultimately, District X feels like a case of potential never quite realised - and not just because it got cut off by a change {{in the direction of the}} line".|$|R
5000|$|Juhi Pandey who co-starred in {{the videos}} said [...] "We knew {{when we were}} {{shooting}} the video that it would {{get a lot of}} reactions. Eyebrows would be raised and {{there would be a lot}} of discussion. We've all had these discussions in our social groups and have all felt angry and frustrated at these statements that have made headlines. Yes, this video will only reach the English-speaking, 'sarcasm-understanding' young person, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it's</b> out there.

5000|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} {{across a wide}} range of media. The website Metacritic, which aggregates reviews and ratings, shows a 68% score for 'Mind Chaos' from twelve critics' reviews.Reviewing for Drowned in Sound, Neil Ashman said [...] "...at their best they produce some thrilling pop music, and while failing to create a consistently brilliant album, tracks like 'Song Away', 'Too Fake' and 'Learn To Lose' sound good in any year." [...] Similarly, Adam Conner-Simons at the Boston Globe summed up his review with the words [...] "Derivative? Maybe, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it’s</b> deftly derived and delivered with purpose and spunk." [...] and a 70% rating.|$|R
5000|$|Longtime Ant fan (and Cool Zombie video extra) Simon Price {{praised the}} album {{in his review}} for The Independent, giving it {{four out of five}} stars. [...] "What this album isn't is an attempt to {{recapture}} Ant's glory days: there's no Burundi double-drumming and no spaghetti-western guitar. The Ant album {{it reminds me of the}} most, in fact, is Dirk Wears White Sox: there's the same mid-fi production, and the same mix of perversion ... It's sprawling, overdue and not for everyone, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it's</b> not a play-it-safe comeback with the hot producer of the day.

5000|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Dracula III: Legacy has been mixed, though more positive in general {{than that of}} Dracula II: Ascension. John Puccio of DVD Town said, [...] "This one is no world beater and hardly scary, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it's</b> got mood and tone and atmosphere to spare, something the first two movies in the ongoing series lacked entirely. ... Dracula III: Legacy contains some decent acting and some solid atmospherics." [...] Kevin Carr of 7M Pictures said, [...] "At least in the cinematic morass that is modern movies, Dracula III {{is better than the}} wimpy vampire lore pioneered by Anne Rice. ... Dracula III falls somewhere below Hellraiser but above the Crow sequels. It's not a grand placement, but there's always a market for vampire movies." ...|$|R

Sasha Geffen wrote in Consequence of Sound that the album [...] "is a huge mess, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it's</b> an honest one"; Pitchfork Medias Meaghan Garvey criticized Cyrus for releasing [...] "the definition of a vanity project".|$|R
