Brown would remain in this role for 10 years and two months, making him the longest-serving Chancellor in modern history.

5|$|Due to the {{hurricane}} and the widespread destruction, {{the hurricane}} caused outbreaks of malaria, dengue, cholera, and various fever and respiratory illnesses. Ongoing flooding caused {{an outbreak of}} Leptospirosis, notably in Cortés Department. There were widespread food and water shortages, leaving villagers near-starvation. Damaged crops also prevented the export of cash crops, and exports decreased by 9.4% in 1999. Many of the people left homeless also became unemployed, and there were reductions in exports and economic growth. Officials set up shelters that housed 285,000people for about a month. In Tegucigalpa, where the Choluteca River was dammed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide,</b> a temporary lagoon filled with sewage persisted for about two months, until a crew from the United States Army Corps of Engineers and United States Geological Survey dug a channel to drain the water.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the death}} of Kirchner caused a power vacuum, as Cristina Kirchner had ruled so far as a figurehead, while Néstor Kirchner still managed the {{government}}. She changed {{the style of the}} government making it more authoritarian, and more critical of the U.S.. She broke with allies of her husband, such as the union leader Hugo Moyano, and increased the political clout of the youth wing La Cámpora instead. She also relied on her public image more than her husband had. The popularity of the Kirchners had been in a decline at the time of Néstor's death, but after being widowed, Cristina Kirchner's popularity increased greatly. As a result, she won the reelection in the 2011 general elections <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide.</b>|$|E

5|$|Local {{elections}} {{were held in}} October. The mayor of Buenos Aires, Aníbal Ibarra, was reelected in a runoff against Mauricio Macri. Neither were Peronists, but Ibarra supported Kirchner and Macri was supported by Duhalde. Duhalde remained an influential figure in the Buenos Aires province; his ally Felipe Solá was elected governor <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide,</b> and the PJ received its highest number of deputies since 1983 and won mayoral elections in several cities lost to the UCR in 1999. The three leading candidates in the Buenos Aires province were all Peronists. Victories in the other provinces gave the PJ control of the Congress, and three-quarters of Argentina's governors were Peronists. According to journalist Mariano Grondona, Argentine politics had become a dominant-party system.|$|E
5|$|The American Red Cross {{called it}} a major disaster, but getting relief into the area was stalled because of {{landslides}} blocking the ridge route running between Los Angeles and Kern counties. California State Route 99 was also blocked <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide</b> ten miles south of Gorman, but the highway was quickly reopened later in the day. All aircraft {{not related to the}} relief effort were ordered not to land at the Tehachapi Municipal Airport. All 417 inmates from the Tehachapi Prison for Women were evacuated because of damage; the California Department of Corrections stated that the facility was left unusable. Most of the injured received medical care at Kern County General Hospital and some sought treatment at Tehachapi Valley Hospital, where some existing patients were moved to make room for new arrivals.|$|E
5|$|The other crescents {{which give}} Bath its {{architectural}} identity include: Camden Crescent {{which was built}} by John Eveleigh in 1788, and damaged <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide</b> in 1889, Lansdown Crescent, designed by John Palmer and constructed {{by a variety of}} builders between 1789 and 1793, and Somerset Place for which the facades were designed by the architect John Eveleigh who went bankrupt during the building, which started in 1790 but was not completed until the 1820s. Some of Somerset Crescent was destroyed during the Second World War and rebuilt as student accommodation in the 1950s and 1960s. It used to form part of the campus of Bath Spa University, but has since been sold.|$|E

5|$|The storm left {{nearly all}} of Zhejiang without power and cut half of all {{communication}} links. The heavy damage prompted officials to declare a state of emergency. In Wenzhou alone, over 18,000homes were destroyed, and 3,850factories were forced to shut down. Also in Wenzhou, Saomai left over 213,000people without clean water. 193people died in the city. In Cangnan County, the typhoon damaged 450schools, totaling ¥25million (RMB, $3.1million USD). Rainfall across the state flooded 56provincial roads and highways. Six people died in Lishui after being crushed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide.</b> Throughout Zhejiang, economic losses totaled ¥4.9billion (RMB, $610million), of which ¥4.5billion (RMB, $560million) was in Wenzhou.|$|E
5|$|After a brief hiatus {{during the}} 1906 general election, which the Liberals won <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide,</b> obtaining a {{majority}} of 126 seats in the House of Commons, Haldane {{turned his attention to}} the Tangier Crisis, which had almost brought France and Germany to war in December. Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, had privately agreed to commit the Army to the aid of France, if attacked, and Haldane began to consider how best to accomplish this. He quickly concluded that there was a need for a regular expeditionary force, specifically prepared and trained for use as a continental intervention force. The question now became how to provide this force, and after a short period Haldane settled on a strength of six infantry divisions and their supporting units. They would need to be organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom, as they would be committed into action as soon as they reached the Continent.|$|E
5|$|At Gunnison, US-89 turns east before curving {{northeast}} {{into the}} Sanpete Valley, {{formed by the}} San Pitch River, {{a tributary of the}} Sevier River. Along US-89 in this valley are several small cities: Manti, Ephraim, Mount Pleasant, and Fairview. Between Ephraim and Mount Pleasant, US-89 meets the south end of SR-132 at Pigeon Hollow Junction. SR-132 was formerly US-189, connecting US-89 with US-91 in Nephi. Beyond Fairview, where the scenic SR-31 turns east, US-89 climbs out of the valley, reaching a summit at Hill Top (elevation 6400 feet/2000 m). Thistle Creek parallels the next leg of the highway, descending through a canyon to the junction with US-6 near the ghost town of Thistle, flooded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide</b> in 1983. Thistle Creek and Soldier Creek, paralleled by US-89 and US-6, merge near this junction to form Spanish Fork, which the overlapped routes follow northwest through Spanish Fork Canyon into the Utah Valley at Moark Junction. US-89 splits to the north from US-6 there, skirts the west edge of Mapleton, and merges with SR-51 - the old Arrowhead Trail (US-91) - south of downtown Springville.|$|E

5|$|Dredd persuaded {{new chief}} judge McGruder {{to permit the}} {{citizens}} to vote in a referendum on whether democratic government should be restored, or the existing Judge System should be retained. McGruder agreed because the Judges had lost much of their credibility in failing to protect the citizens from the Dark Judges during Necropolis: since the Judges' argument in favour of their dictatorial rule rested largely on their allegedly unique ability to protect the city and preserve order (which the last elected government had conspicuously failed to do), the Democrats' calls for reform were consequently more compelling than ever. The Democracy Referendum was scheduled for 2113, and was not popular among the rank-and-file judges, or even the senior ranks, since almost everybody predicted that the unpopular Judges would lose the vote <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide.</b> So much did the Referendum depend on Dredd's personal support that Judge Grice and other judges even tried to assassinate him to prevent the vote from going ahead.|$|E
5|$|The Whitlam Government {{implemented}} {{a large number}} of new programs and policy changes, including the termination of military conscription, institution of universal health care and free university education, and the implementation of legal aid programs. With the opposition-controlled Senate delaying passage of bills, Whitlam called a double dissolution election in 1974 in which he won a majority in the House of Representatives, albeit a slightly reduced one, and picked up three Senate seats.The Whitlam government then instituted the first and only 1974 joint sitting enabled under s. 57 of the Constitution as part of the double dissolution process. Despite the government's second election victory, the opposition, reacting to government scandals and a flagging economy suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and the 1973–75 recession, continued to obstruct the government's program in the Senate. In late 1975, the Opposition Senators refused to allow a vote on the government's appropriation bills, returning them to the House of Representatives with a demand that the government go to an election, thus denying the government supply. Whitlam refused to back down, arguing that his government, which held a clear majority in the House of Representatives, was being held to ransom by the Senate. The crisis ended on 11 November, when Whitlam arrived at a pre-arranged meeting with the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, at Government House in order to call a half-Senate election. Kerr dismissed him and commissioned the opposition leader, Malcolm Fraser, as prime minister. Labor lost the subsequent election <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>landslide.</b>|$|E
