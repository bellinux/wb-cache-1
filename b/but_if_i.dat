25|$|I am {{now before}} {{you in a}} public character. If, in that situation, I have given you offence, you have an undoubted right to call for an apology or defence; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have erred as a private individual, {{the nature of that}} error cannot with {{discretion}} come under your notice. It will probably be investigated by a court, constituted to hear both the accuser and the accused, and where justice only can be done.|$|E
25|$|The Imperial Closet {{this small}} {{building}} was situated {{to the east}} of the Temple of Friendship designed by Gibbs and built in 1739. The interior had paintings of Titus, Hadrian & Marcus Aurelius with these inscriptions beneath each painting: 'Diem perdidi' (I have lost the day), 'Pro me: si merear in me' (For me, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> deserve it, against me) & 'Ita regnes imperator, ut privatus regi tevelis' (So govern when an emperor, as, if a private person, you would desire to be governed). The building was demolished in 1759.|$|E

25|$|It {{will be a}} win-at-all costs approach. We're {{going to}} go out and give 110 per cent-over four days of every Shield game. If you give 110 per cent, you'll win a lot more games than you lose. I've been 12 months out of the game <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> see a ball I think I can hit, I will hit it... It's a big part of the {{captaincy}} so everyone knows where they stand. A happy team turns into a confident team and wins matches. But I have a hell of a lot to learn. It's my first shot at it and I will be listening to a lot of people. People who are willing to give advice and have a bit of a yarn.|$|E
25|$|Still another {{possibility}} is that the code generated may employ an auxiliary variable as the loop variable, possibly held in a machine register, whose value {{may or may not be}} copied to I on each iteration. Again, modifications of I would not affect the control of the loop, but now a disjunction is possible: within the loop, references to the value of I might be to the (possibly altered) current value of I or to the auxiliary variable (held safe from improper modification) and confusing results are guaranteed. For instance, within the loop a reference to element I of an array would likely employ the auxiliary variable (especially if it were held in a machine register), <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> is a parameter to some routine (for instance, a print-statement to reveal its value), it would likely be a reference to the proper variable I instead. It is best to avoid such possibilities.|$|E

The producers told Till his audition served for both Havok and Beast, and the actor replied that despite his lifelong dream of playing a superhero, [...] "I know you'll kill me, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> get Beast, I'm not in the movie.

500|$|Monk was {{originally}} envisioned as a [...] "more goofy and physical" [...] Inspector Clouseau type of character. However, co-creator David Hoberman {{came up with}} the idea of a detective with obsessive-compulsive disorder. This was inspired by his own bout with self-diagnosed obsessive-compulsive disorder; in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette interview, he stated that, [...] "Like Monk, I couldn't walk on cracks and had to touch poles. I have no idea why [...] <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't do these things, something terrible would happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Why {{not just}} tell people I'm an alien from Mars? Tell them I eat live {{chickens}} {{and do a}} voodoo dance at midnight. They'll believe anything you say, because you're a reporter. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I,</b> Michael Jackson, were to say, [...] "I'm an alien from Mars and I eat live chickens and do a voodoo dance at midnight," [...] people would say, [...] "Oh, man, that Michael Jackson is nuts. He's cracked up. You can't believe a single word {{that comes out of}} his mouth." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1921 and 1922 teams {{also claimed}} SIAA titles. The 1921 team {{suffered}} its only loss to undefeated, eastern power Penn State. Tech was captained by fullback Judy Harlan. Future Tech fullback Sam Murray {{was asked about}} a certain strong runner in the 1930s, [...] "He's good. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were playing again, I would have one wish [...] never to see earing down upon me a more fearsome picture of power than Judy Harlan blocking for Red Barron." [...] Barron ran for 1,459 yards on the season.|$|E

500|$|R. Kelly, portraying [...] "The Remix Killer", {{released}} an unofficial remix {{of the song}} in April 2008. During most of his section of the song, Kelly sings of shining, drinking and two-stepping in a club, and he promises to kiss any place on Mariah's body she wants: [...] "Girl, if you let me, I'm gonna touch it / <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> touch it, I'm gonna wanna hit it." [...] Later, he mimics Carey's bridge: [...] "If some honies up in here that want me to touch her body / Touch it / Let me hear you say, 'I-i-i-i do.'" [...] According to Kelly, the remix is unofficial, and his lyrics are freestyle rap.|$|E
500|$|Vows of {{resistance}} from the self-declared president of Anjouan were met with stern words from the AU envoy, saying [...] "He will be overwhelmed...I am afraid {{to say that if}} he tries to do that, it will be the end of him physically, if necessary." [...] In an interview with IRIN, Mohamed Bacar said: [...] " [...] Sambi does not know anything concerning the military, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had to advise him I would say that it's not the solution. The first time [...] the army came we kicked them out. The second time [...] the army came we kicked them out. That means that if they try to come a third time we will kick them out." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2003, riots {{broke out}} in Phnom Penh after a Cambodian {{newspaper}} incorrectly reported that a Thai actress had stated Angkor Wat properly belonged to Thailand. On 29 January, the Thai embassy was burned, and hundreds of Thai immigrants fled the country to avoid the violence. During the riots, a caller to Beehive Radio claimed incorrectly that Cambodian embassy officials were killed in Bangkok. On 31 January, Sonando was arrested and accused of [...] "relaying false information", [...] "inciting discrimination", and [...] "inciting crime". He stated to reporters, [...] "They blame me for broadcasting an opinion of a listener {{which turned out to}} be untrue. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have to go to jail to allow people to express their opinion I am happy." ...|$|E

500|$|Gerard George Lowe {{came from}} Johannesburg, South Africa. He was a {{chemical}} engineer with South African Breweries. He went to Singapore {{to shop for}} electrical and electronic goods. Before he left Johannesburg on 7 March 1995, he told his wife Vanessa, a local airlines employee, his exact schedule, saying: [...] "I will call you the moment I check into the hotel {{to give you the}} contact number. If you do not hear from me on 10 March, it would mean that I would have a seat on the plane to return to South Africa and would arrive home on 11 March. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> do call you on 10 March, that would mean that I have not managed to get a seat and would return on 12 March." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} in time, [...] Morrison was under {{pressure}} by Warner Bros. Records to produce chart singles and two albums within a year. [...] His previous album, His Band and the Street Choir, had been released in November 1970. [...] In an interview with journalist Sean O'Hagan in 1990, he described this period as being {{in contrast to the}} laid back atmosphere pictured on the album cover: [...] "When I went to the West Coast these people [...] weren't that available so I had to virtually put a completely new band together overnight to do [...] So it was a very tough period. I didn't want to change my band <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wanted to get into the studio I had to ring up and get somebody. That was the predicament I was in." ...|$|E
500|$|When the dikes in Grand Forks {{could not}} keep out the {{flooding}} river, Pat Owens ordered the evacuation of over 50,000 people on April 18, which up to that time, had been the largest civilian evacuation in the United States since the evacuation of residents in Atlanta, Georgia, during the Civil War. She later reflected on the decision saying, [...] "...if I evacuate this city and nothing happens they're gonna impeach me. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don't, we're going to lose lives." [...] Because all transportation was cut off between the two cities (and for many miles, the two states), East Grand Forks residents were evacuated to nearby Crookston, namely to the University of Minnesota Crookston, while residents of Grand Forks, who were given mandatory evacuation orders on April 18, went to Grand Forks Air Force Base (residents stayed in airplane hangars containing more than 3,000 cots).|$|E

500|$|Clarke {{was never}} {{sure if she}} would finish her novel or {{if it would be}} published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, {{beginning}} at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule. Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together. Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not for the reader, [...] "clung to this method" [...] "because I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning, [...] would lack depth, and I would just be skimming the surface of what I could do. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had known {{it was going to take}} me ten years, I would never have begun. I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year, or the year after next." [...] Clarke and Greenland fell in love while she was writing the novel and moved in together.|$|E
500|$|In Super Street Fighter IV, the {{developers}} attempted to retain Ibuki's playstyle and feel from Street Fighter III. She was also given a super jump (the only character, other than C. Viper, {{to have one}} in this game) and made adjustments to have combos that utilize it. Capcom's Taketoshi Sano said that [...] "Ibuki is suited to {{those who want to}} get the most out of a single character" [...] and [...] "beginners can use her too, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had to pick I'd say she's suited for intermediate." [...] Capcom Europe described Ibuki’s [...] "Raida" [...] ("Thunder Strike") command grab as having some unique properties and being one of the most powerful moves in the game. According to an MTV guide, Ibuki is [...] "one of the hardest characters to master in this latest iteration" [...] and players need to gain [...] "a strong understanding of each character's moves and abilities before truly coming to grips with what the weak, yet versatile Ibuki has to offer." ...|$|E
500|$|While commenting {{in regards}} to the lyrical content of the song on Australian talk show, Rove, Gaga said that she was unrepentant about her [...] "disco stick" [...] metaphor, though it led to a banning of the music video on Network Ten in Australia. She added that the metaphor was not meant to be subtle and was clear what the lyrics {{constituted}} off. [...] "If anything, I happen to think people are frivolously hard on me", Gaga generalized. She went on to relegate [...] "lot of youth-oriented pop music" [...] as much racier than hers with their sexually provocative lyrics, but Gaga felt that the whole context of her visuals alongside the music was what made people react. [...] "It's the music in relation to the visual, in relation to the way I move and the way I articulate the lyrics. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wanted to make music to make people sing 'la di da' that would be very boring," [...] she concluded.|$|E
