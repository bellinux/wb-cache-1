5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the project, as a 1982 Defense Nuclear Agency report explained, was both medical {{as well as for}} {{research}} purposes: The purposes of 4.1 were to (1) evaluate the severity of radiation injury to the human <b>beings</b> <b>exposed,</b> (2) provide for all necessary medical care, and (3) conduct a scientific study of radiation injuries to human beings.|$|R
5|$|All Operation Crossroads {{operations}} {{were designed to}} keep personnel from <b>being</b> <b>exposed</b> to more than 0.1 roentgen (R) per day. At the time, this {{was considered to be}} an amount of radiation that could be tolerated for long periods without any harmful effects on health. Since there was no special clothing or radiation shielding available, the protection plan relied on managing who went where, when, and for how long.|$|E

Byers hopes that he will meet her at the convention.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} mathematical challenges of chess is the development of algorithms that can play chess. The idea of creating a chess-playing machine dates to the 18thcentury; around 1769, the chess-playing automaton called The Turk became famous before <b>being</b> <b>exposed</b> as a hoax. Serious trials based on automata, such as El Ajedrecista, were too complex and limited to be useful.|$|E

5|$|As many {{symptoms}} {{of carbon monoxide}} poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult. A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as <b>being</b> <b>exposed</b> to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared {{to the amount of}} hemoglobin in the blood.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} coaster's major refurbishment, a new, {{original}} storyline {{was added}} with a completely redesigned queue experience that places guests inside a perilous scientific experiment led by General Thaddeus Ross. The entrance features a statue of Hulk holding one of the ride's vehicles over his head, and arching tracks passing over him. These arching coaster tracks came from the original Hulk Roller Coaster. The televisions now show CGI animations of test subjects <b>being</b> <b>exposed</b> to gamma radiation and being transformed into Hulk-like creatures. As of April 2015, riders must pass through metal detectors and security personnel and must rid themselves of all loose items from their pockets.|$|E
5|$|Despite these precautions, {{pollution}} {{from the power}} stations was still a factor. In 1954, consideration was given to scrapping the plan to build the Union Hall housing estate in Lemington because of probable {{pollution from}} nearby power stations. This was mainly {{because some of the}} houses were as high as, if not higher than, the power stations' chimneys. At times, this meant the estate <b>being</b> <b>exposed</b> to as much as 1.25 parts per million of sulphur dioxide. However the estate was still built, as these peak conditions were thought unlikely to occur on more than 18 days in a year.|$|E

5|$|For most {{conspicuous}} bravery near Richebourg L'Avoue on 18 May 1915. With a bombing party of 10 men, who voluntarily undertook this duty, he conveyed {{a supply of}} 96 bombs to within 20 yards of the enemy's position over exceptionally dangerous ground, after the attempts of two other parties had failed. Lieutenant Smyth succeeded in taking the bombs to the desired position {{with the aid of}} two of his men (the other eight having been killed or wounded), and to effect his purpose he had to swim a stream, <b>being</b> <b>exposed</b> the whole time to howitzer, shrapnel, machine-gun and rifle fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} between these two deposits can {{be accounted for by}} a few factors, including time of eruption and placement. The material inside the caldera must be younger and erupted from a pool of magma that had larger crystals. Its extensive erosion {{can be explained by the}} presence of hydrothermal vents, and its high levels of lithics probably originate from either <b>being</b> <b>exposed</b> to the rocks after they were erupted, lying adjacent to them while they underwent subsidence, or is a result of long, slow formation. Any of these reasons would also effectively account for the poor mixing of the lavas.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will.

5|$|To {{resolve the}} {{possibility}} of his bigamy <b>being</b> <b>exposed,</b> Minnie pushed Brinkley to file for divorce from Sally, which he did in December 1915. To prevent the court from inquiring of Sally directly, he wrote {{that they had been}} married in New York City, and {{that he did not know}} her current place of residence. The divorce was finalized on February 21, 1916. Four days later, Minnie and Brinkley were married again, this time in Liberty, Missouri. Brinkley had not waited the required six months from divorce to subsequent remarriage.|$|E
5|$|Another stock {{plot device}} in the 1970s was the gay {{character}} in a police drama. They served as victims of blackmail or anti-gay violence, but more often as criminals. Beginning in the late 1960s with N.Y.P.D., Police Story, and Police Woman, the use of homosexuals in stories became much more prevalent, according to Vito Russo, {{as a response to}} their higher profiles in gay activism. Lesbians were included as villains, motivated to murder by their desires, internalized homophobia, or fear of <b>being</b> <b>exposed</b> as homosexual. One episode of Police Woman earned protests by the National Gay Task Force before it aired for portraying a trio of murderous lesbians who killed retirement home patients for their money. NBC edited the episode because of the protests, but a sit-in was staged in the head of NBC's offices.|$|E
5|$|Burnet {{served as}} a member or {{chairman}} of scientific committees, both in Australia and overseas. Between 1947 and 1953, {{he was a member}} of the National Health and Medical Research Council's Medical Research Advisory Committee. The committee advised on funding for medical research in Australia. During this same period (1947–52), he was also a member of the Commonwealth government's Defence Research and Development Policy Committee. Declassified files from this committee show that Burnet made the recommendation that Australia pursue development of chemical and biological weapons to target neighbouring countries' food stocks and spread infectious diseases. His report was titled War from a Biological Angle. Between 1955 and 1959, he was chairman of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee; he was concerned that Australians were <b>being</b> <b>exposed</b> to unnecessary medical and industrial radiation.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} environment, several life forms {{have been found}} that can {{withstand}} extreme space conditions for extended periods. Species of lichen carried on the ESA BIOPAN facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007. Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum germinated after <b>being</b> <b>exposed</b> to space for 1.5 years. A strain of bacillus subtilis has survived 559 days when exposed to low-Earth orbit or a simulated martian environment. The lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world. A conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early {{in the history of}} the Solar System, with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks being exchanged between Venus, Earth, and Mars.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of <b>being</b> <b>exposed</b> to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Isabel {{produced}} {{slightly above}} normal tides and rough surf along the Jersey shore, killing one surfer off of Wildwood Crest. The combination of gusty winds {{and the heavy}} surf produced moderate beach erosion along much of the coastline, primarily to beaches facing southeastward. In the Delaware Bay and River area, no significant erosion was reported, though coastal flooding from the hurricane washed out a road and destroyed {{the deck of a}} house in Baypoint. In Cape May County waves eroded the beaches by up to 4feet (1.2m) in Ocean City and Avalon, with several cities experiencing a loss of dunes and geotubes in Whale Beach <b>being</b> <b>exposed.</b> Waves from Isabel in Atlantic County resulted in light damage, minor coastal flooding, and slight beach erosion. The beaches of southern Ocean County experienced a loss of 3 to 4feet (0.9 to 1.2m) of sand, while locations further to the north experienced only minor erosion. Most coastal areas of Monmouth County reported eroded beaches by up to 4feet (1.2m), with Union Beach losing about 5,000sq. feet (465sq. m) of sand.|$|E
