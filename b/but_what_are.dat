500|$|An {{unusually large}} amount of in-camera effects {{were used for the}} pilot in place of {{computer}} generated imagery, including [...] "upside-down day"; shots of Haller using his abilities, where multiple takes of debris were filmed in controlled camera movements and then overlayed on shots of Stevens acting on his own; a montage that appears as a single camera movement, pulling [...] "back in slow motion as we see David Haller’s childhood progress"; and a one-shot action sequence—actually filmed in two shots that were later connected with visual effects—that saw the camera mounted on a cable and run down a hill side. Hawley admitted {{that it would be a}} challenge for the series' other directors to maintain this quality of visuals with much less time to film each episode: Hawley had 21 days to film the pilot, but the subsequent episodes were only scheduled 8 days of filming each. Some of these shoots ultimately had to be extended to 10 or 11 days filming to meet Hawley's vision, which he said were [...] "not good calls to have <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> you going to do? It’s a huge show." [...] Keller felt that each episode in the season was noticeably different from the others, calling the series a uniquely [...] "director-driven show.

2500|$|The Society of American Indians {{was opposed}} to Wild West shows, {{theatrical}} troupes, circuses and most motion picture firms. The Society believed that theatrical shows were demoralizing and degrading to Indians, and discouraged Indians from Wild Westing.

[...] Another, Susan Estrich, said [...] "I teach criminal law. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> we dealing with here? The mafia, or a sports team from a first-class university.

[...] Former prosecutor Wendy Murphy supplied the case {{with some of the most}} inflammatory claims and supported Nifong's withholding of evidence saying, [...] "Nifong should be rewarded for respecting the defendants' rights by not leaking the type of evidence that could help him personally respond to criticism."

2500|$|Botham {{went on to}} Bucklers Mead Comprehensive School {{where he}} {{continued}} {{to do well in}} sport and played for the school's cricket and football teams. He became captain of their under-16 cricket team when he was thirteen. His performances for the school drew the attention of Somerset County Cricket Club's youth coach Bill Andrews. Still thirteen, he scored 80 runs on debut for Somerset's under-15s side against Wiltshire, but the team captain Phil Slocombe did not call on him to bowl as he considered him to be a specialist batsman. Two years later, Botham had the opportunity to choose between football and cricket: Bert Head, manager of Crystal Palace offered him apprentice forms with the First Division club. He already had a contract with Somerset and, after discussing the offer with his father, decided to continue to pursue a cricket career, as he believed he was a better cricketer. When informed {{that he wanted to be}} a sportsman, Botham's careers teacher said to him: [...] "Fine, everyone wants to play sport, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> you really going to do?" ...|$|E
2500|$|She starred with Colin Firth and Jeffrey Dean Morgan in The Accidental Husband, {{a romantic}} comedy where she played a woman who finds herself married while engaged to another man. The film was {{released}} in theaters the UK in 2008, but received a direct-to-video premiere in the US, due to financial problems at distributor Yari Film Group. Also in 2008, she took {{on the role of}} a cocaine addict in the British television drama My Zinc Bed, co-starring Paddy Considine and Jonathan Pryce. In 2009's Motherhood, she starred as a New York City mother whose dilemmas of marriage, work, and self are shown in the trials and tribulations of one pivotal day. Distributed for a limited release to certain parts of the United States only, the independent dramedy garnered just US$93,388 in three weeks of release. [...] The New York Times critic A. O. Scott felt that Thurman's character is [...] "scattered, ambivalent, flaky and inconsistent [...] all of which is fine, and energetically conveyed by Ms. Thurman. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> tolerable quirks in a person can be deadly to a narrative [...] the movie stumbles from loose and scruffy naturalism to sitcom tidiness".|$|E
2500|$|Depending {{on whether}} or not Mathgamain and Máel Muad were {{successful}} in achieving anything following their resolution in 972, Ivar {{may or may not have}} found himself in a very weakened position. Curiously neither of our major primary sources has anything clear to say about the state of affairs at this time. But in 974 Ivar met with misforture, the Annals of Inisfallen reporting that [...] "The son of Aralt made a circuit of Ireland with a great company, and plundered Inis Cathaig, and brought Ímar from it into captivity.", and the Annals of the Four Masters [...] "The plundering of Inis-Cathaigh by Maghnus , son of Aralt, with the Lag-manns [...] of the islands along with him; and Imhar, lord of the foreigners of Luimneach, was carried off from the island, and the violation of Seanan thereby." [...] His captor is easily identified as Maccus mac Arailt, King of Mann and the Isles, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> unknown are the circumstances. Ivar may have gone to Scattery because he had been driven out of Limerick proper, or it could have been for some other reason, and whether or not he and Maccus were already associated is unknown. Benjamin Hudson has offered the explanation that this event can be related to Ivar's earlier adventure in Britain as reported in the Cogad, arguing that the [...] "King of Britain" [...] reported slaying his comrade Amlaíb mac Amlaíb should be understood as either Maccus or his brother Gofraid mac Arailt and not some king of the Welsh, otherwise [...] "it probably would have been mentioned in the insular records". (Assuming Hudson is referring only to the Welsh and English records.) Elaborating, he reads this sequence beginning with [...] "a battle over the exploitation of the Welsh" [...] which the sons of Aralt won, and eventually ending with Maccus following Ivar all the way around Ireland to finish it.|$|E
