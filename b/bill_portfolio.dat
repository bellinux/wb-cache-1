They are effective for the Bank of Canada in 2007. As {{a result of these}} changes, the Bank has begun valuing its holdings of Government of Canada treasury bills on a fair value basis and is carrying any unrealized valuation gains or losses on these investments in a new account (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income) that forms part of its capital base. The Bank's capital base is likely to experience some volatility over time as the treasury <b>bill</b> <b>portfolio</b> records unrealized valuation gains or losses in response to movements in short-term interest rates. The Bank of Canada Act has been amended to allow the Bank's Board of Directors the right to establish a new special reserve fund that will form part of the Bank's capital base.

In April 1948, his portfolio was {{merged with the}} Supply functions of <b>Bill</b> Ashley's <b>portfolio</b> to create the portfolio of Supply and Development and he was attacked by the opposition for the breadth of his powers. Following Labor's defeat at the 1949 election, he became deputy-leader of the Opposition in the Senate. He was relegated to an unwinnable fourth position on Labor's ticket for the 1961 election and left parliament in July 1962.|$|R

[...] Combet had decided to step down over health concerns prior to Prime Minister Gillard's defeat in a leadership spill on 26 June 2013, but brought this decision forward and announced he would step down as minister and not contest his seat in the upcoming election.

They also explore the origin of these disparities. Two of the disparities (bill passage and party leadership) are partly explained by the tendency of districts with larger African American populations to be less electorally competitive.

50|$|Wharton {{served as}} Deputy Secretary of State (the number two {{position}} in the Department) from January 27 to November 8, 1993 under President <b>Bill</b> Clinton. Wharton’s <b>portfolio</b> included the reorganization of the State Department, the foreign aid budget and the restructuring of the Agency for International Development, {{but he was not}} directly involved in the formulation of the policies that ran into trouble at State. Nevertheless, he was forced to resign after Secretary Warren Christopher leaked rumors of his disappointment with Wharton's performance on the job. Editorials and op-eds commented that Wharton was unfairly cast as a scapegoat for the failures of Clinton’s foreign policies since Wharton had not been involved in foreign policy.|$|R
40|$|The article {{provides}} {{evidence that the}} Basel Accord-based IMF mandated regulatory reforms that have been enacted into law in Turkey are neither necessary for the safety and soundness of the Turkish banking system nor sufficient to provide it. There are two reasons for this. First, the diversification and security analysis stressed in Basel Accord-mandated risk management plans is not {{an important source of}} risk reduction in portfolios containing only Turkish assets. Second, a 10 % ratio of equity to Turkish assets is too risky to provide a sound banking system there. This position is argued a four-step chain of reasoning: 1. Diversification as a risk management tool in equity portfolios is ineffective in Turkey due to the high relative volatility of and high covariance among Turkish common stocks. Diversified portfolios have comparable volatilities to a one stock portfolio. During crises the diversified portfolio is substantially riskier than a managed portfolio constructed here. 2. Diversification is also no help in market-traded asset portfolios containing Turkish Treasury bills and common stocks. Because Turkish common stocks are so risky on a relative basis and because of their high covariance with Treasury <b>bills,</b> risk-minimizing <b>portfolios</b> of Turkish market-traded securities contain only Turkish Treasury Bills, risky themselves but safe on a relative basis. 3. Diversification using bank direct loan assets are also not important in minimizing risk in portfolios of Turkish assets. They appear only in relatively small amounts in minimum risk portfolios of Turkish assets. Thus minimum-risk portfolios of Turkish assets contain primarily Turkish Treasury bills. 4. Risk minimizing banks holding only Turkish Treasury bills are too risky under the currently required 10 % leverage ratio. Therefore, all Turkish banks are too risky to be consistent with a safe and sound banking system under the 10 % requirement. On the other hand, the article also provides evidence that Turkish Treasury Bills, when combined with foreign mature market securities, do provide reduced risk through diversification. This suggests that foreign banks will find fertile ground in Turkey. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{based on}} {{the past three decades}} of U. S. {{experience}} shows that the difference between the interest rates on commercial paper and Treasury bills has consistently borne a systematic relationship to subsequent fluctuations of nonfinancial economic activity. This interest rate spread typically widens in advance of recessions, and narrows again before recoveries. The relationship remains valid even after allowance for other financial variables that previous researchers have often advanced as potential business cycle predictors. This paper provides support for each of three different explanations for this predictive power of the paper?bill spread. First, changing perceptions of default risk exert a clearly recognizable influence on the spread. This influence is all the more discernable after allowance for effects associated with the changing volume of paper issuance when investors view commercial paper and Treasury <b>bills</b> as imperfect <b>portfolio</b> substitutes [...] a key assumption for which the evidence introduced here provides support. Second, again under conditions of imperfect substitutability, a widening paper-bill spread is also a symptom of the contraction in bank lending due to tighter monetary policy. Third, there is also evidence of a further role for independent changes in the behavior of borrowers in the commercial paper market due to their changing cash requirements {{over the course of the}} business cycle. ...|$|R
