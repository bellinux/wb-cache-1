A variety of undergraduate disciplines are being coupled with international components to <b>bring</b> <b>U.</b> S. students {{to a higher level}} of global awareness {{to meet the demands of}} today’s economy. The University of Connecticut’s Eurotech Program is an example of this trend. Its students earn degrees in both German and engineering in a five year program. They are given practical training through study and internships in Germany under the auspices of the Baden-Württemberg Exchange Program. One of the Eurotech Program’s major goals is to enhance job opportunities for its graduates by giving them the linguistic and cultural skills to interact with German engineers in the U. S. and Germany and thereby making them more attractive to employers. The study includes an overview of the Eurotech Program, a survey of literature concerning study abroad goals and the collection and analysis of data from former and current participants of the program through their responses on questionnaires. The study highlights the achievements of the program’s goals as the Eurotech students see them...|$|E
40|$|One {{purpose of}} {{passage of the}} Trade Agreements Act of 1979 was to <b>bring</b> <b>U.</b> S. countervailing duty and {{antidumping}} law into conformity with the comparable laws of GATT trading partners by raising the standard required for enforcement action by the International Trade Commission. While the 2 ̆ 2 material injury 2 ̆ 2 standard adopted in the Act had its origins in the GATT, the standard was also influenced by other international agreements, {{as well as the}} history of U. S. countervailing duty law and its application by the ITC [...] sources which were often inconsistent, if not contradictory. The 2 ̆ 2 threat of material injury 2 ̆ 2 standard was particularly difficult to interpret because it was not separately defined from material injury in the Act and, unlike the definition of material injury, it did not require a showing of measurable injury to a domestic industry. The statutory vagueness of the threat standard troubled critics who felt it would be an unmanageable and ineffective guideline for enforcement action. The author argues, however, that an examination of ITC decisions under this standard demonstrates not only that the standard is intelligible but also that it provides an adequate guide for a coherent, predictable, and supportable enforcement policy which is consistent with the GATT...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that advocates for new U. S. {{agricultural}} trade policies should consider refocusing their campaigns on the corporate livestock sector rather than farmers. There {{is little evidence that}} farmers as a group are reaping significant gains from current U. S. agricultural subsidy programs, even though they are the direct recipients. Low prices and high costs have left farmers with stagnant or declining net farm incomes. Furthermore, there is little conclusive evidence that the removal of U. S. subsidy payments would significantly reduce production or raise prices, though there is significant disagreement on this point. There is wider agreement that U. S. farm policies contribute significantly to depressed prices for agricultural commodities. Among the beneficiaries of those low prices are the consumers of U. S. grains and oilseeds, notably the concentrated animal feeding operations that now dominate the U. S. livestock industry. These industrial operations get feed that is generally sold at below farmers’ costs of production. We raise two questions for future research, and provide tentative answers. First, would U. S. policies that ensure higher feed prices reduce the incentives toward concentrated feeding operations and tip the economic balance back toward diversified family farmers? Initial research suggests that the economic benefits of current policies to corporate livestock operators are significant and that their reform could contribute to structural change in the farm sector in favor of family farmers. Second, since subsidies to feed are not now treated as highly disciplined input subsidies for livestock operations under World Trade Organization rules, would a more accurate accounting <b>bring</b> <b>U.</b> S. subsidies above the maximum levels allowed in the prevailing Agreement on Agriculture? We present initial calculations that suggest such an accounting change would put the United States over is limit for 2000 and nearly over for 2001. ...|$|E
40|$|Last year 245, 424 noncitizens {{were removed}} from the United States, and courts played {{virtually}} no role in ensuring that these decisions did not violate individual substantive rights like freedom of speech, substantive due process, or retroactivity. Had these individuals been deported from a European country, domestic and regional courts would have reviewed the decisions to ensure compatibility with these types of rights. Numerous international law scholars and immigration scholars seek to minimize the gap between the legal processes offered in the United States and Europe for noncitizens challenging deportation orders. Many of these scholars contend that greater recognition of international human rights in U. S. courts would <b>bring</b> <b>U.</b> S. deportation jurisprudence closer to its European counterpart. While appealing, these arguments fail to recognize that the availability of rights is not what distinguishes the European deportation jurisprudence from the American deportation jurisprudence. European courts play {{a more active role in}} reviewing deportation decisions than U. S. courts because of institutional cultural norms regarding the State interests at stake in regulating immigration. European adjudicators conceptualize immigration regulation as a legal matter rather than as a political matter as U. S. adjudicators do. This distinction between “immigration regulation is political” and “immigration regulation is legal” leads to different understandings of the judicial role and thus, to drastically different approaches to judicial review. Deportation jurisprudence provides a useful case for analyzing the relationship between legal rules and institutional culture in protecting individual rights. The literature addressing the domestic enforcement of human rights under-analyzes the role that institutional culture plays in human rights enforcement. This literature tends to focus on the importance of adopting specific laws, an independent judiciary, political will at the highest levels of government, and effective law enforcement personnel. While these are all important factors, institutional culture helps to explain compliance problems when States have the right laws, personnel, and political will. This Article addresses this gap in the literature by exploring the relationship between judicial norms regarding immigration and judicial review of deportation decisions...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the role of main social activities, as {{creating}} and sharing personal content. The reason is connected to the raise up, in last ten years, of User Generated Content as a system to allow people to be active on the Web 3. In the first paragraph I analyze the Web-population through recent surveys, showing different ways to classify generations. I comment the Jenkins’ “convergence culture” [2006], the push and pull media definition of Negroponte [1995] and the difference between digital natives and digital immigrants [Prensky 2001]. The second paragraph deals with use and consumption of digital media between young and adults from the computer use to mobile-phone and portable gaming device. In particular the mobile-phone seems to be an important medium to be online in every place and every time: it allows people to take and share photos, video, text and so on. This brings us to the third paragraph where I discuss mobility and applications: following Anderson [2010] the desktop is replaced with the webtop or web-applications that do not require a browser to be used. This is particularly evident for recent mobile devices as iPhone and iPad. Convergence and mobility allow people to share content in every time: yet ten years ago people used to share digital information (file-sharing) as video, music and text, by illegal channels such as Napster, without knowing who uploaded that on the Web. The Web 1. 0 phase was characterized by an “anonymous dimension”. Instead, the current Web allows people to share information about their own life, publishing on social media, freely, their own photo, video, text, with real name and surname (life-sharing). At the center of the Web is the “ego”, the user. In the fifth chapter I analyze three social media that are currently catching up people’s attention – Facebook, YouTube, Twitter – and I try to explain how they make possible to users to share culture and frame of their life. At the end I spent some words about piracy and privacy issue that social media <b>bring</b> <b>u...</b>|$|E
