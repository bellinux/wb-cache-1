5|$|The biography, Lindbergh, {{was highly}} anticipated; {{prior to its}} publication, the book's film rights were bought, sight unseen, by Steven Spielberg, who planned to direct a movie of it. Published in 1998, Lindbergh sold about 250,000 copies in hardcover, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. Berg was noted for his {{exhaustive}} research, {{as well as his}} sympathetic, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> uncritical, approach to Lindbergh, whose alleged anti-Semitism he addressed in a straightforward, unblinking manner.|$|E
5|$|There {{are about}} 2,000 species of antlion {{found in most}} parts of the world, with the {{greatest}} diversity being in warmer areas. The best known species are those in which the larvae dig pits to trap their prey, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> do all species do this. Antlions live in a range of usually dry habitats including open woodland floors, scrub-clad dunes, hedge bases, river banks, road verges, under raised buildings and in vacant lots.|$|E

25|$|The {{generally}} accepted, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> unanimous, {{interpretation is}} that the Olmec-style artifacts, in all sizes, became associated with elite status and were adopted by non-Olmec Formative Period chieftains {{in an effort to}} bolster their status.|$|E

This master’s dissertation {{would not have been possible}} without his guidance, dedication, and unsurpassed knowledge. Another special thank you to my mom for the ongoing courage and motivation.

25|$|All three {{collections}} of this moss were found growing as an epiphyte {{on the trunk}} of a Macrozamia. It is therefore postulated, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> certain, that the species has a preference for this genus.|$|E
25|$|Most (<b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> all) of {{the class}} were {{eventually}} fitted with mechanical stokers; by 1947, 512 locomotives were stoker-equipped, 39 still hand-fired, and the remaining ten were oil-fired, the latter being an experiment tried during the coal-miners' strikes of that period.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{scarcity}} {{of evidence for}} smaller or local cults does not always imply their neglect; votive inscriptions are inconsistently scattered throughout Rome's geography and history. Inscribed dedications were an expensive public declaration, one to be expected within the Graeco-Roman cultural ambit <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> universal. Innumerable smaller, personal or more secretive cults would have persisted and left no trace.|$|E

25|$|Individuals of African descent have a {{lower level}} of binge {{drinking}} followed by those of Asian descent. In the case of Asians their low level of binge drinking {{may be due to the}} presence of the aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (ALDH2, Chromosome 12) in many (<b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> the vast majority) that results in poor metabolism of alcohol, which leads to severe adverse effects such as facial flushing.|$|E
25|$|A duel {{provoked}} by Voisenon inspired him with remorse, and {{he entered a}} seminary; he was soon promoted to the post of secretary to his relative, the Bishop of Boulogne. He became closely attached to Madame du Châtelet, the mistress of Voltaire, and was intimate with the comte de Caylus and Mademoiselle Jeanne Quinault. He made witty <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> edifying contributions to the Étrennes de Saint-Jean, the Bals de Bois, etc.|$|E
25|$|For {{the symbols}} {{in which the}} bulk, or body, {{terminal}} is shown, it is here shown internally connected to the source (i.e., the black triangles in the diagrams in columns 2 and 5). This is a typical configuration, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> the only important configuration. In general, the MOSFET is a four-terminal device, and in integrated circuits many of the MOSFETs share a body connection, not necessarily connected to the source terminals of all the transistors.|$|E

25|$|The {{salivary glands}} of some species however, are {{modified}} to produce proteins; salivary amylase {{is found in}} many, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> all, bird and mammal species (including humans, as noted above). Furthermore, the venom glands of venomous snakes (colloquially called poisonous snakes), Gila monsters, and some shrews, are modified salivary glands. In other organisms such as insects, salivary glands are often used to produce biologically important proteins like silk or glues, and fly salivary glands contain polytene chromosomes that have been useful in genetic research.|$|E
25|$|There was resistance, {{much of it}} from Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors. But {{there was}} also a pattern of denial, {{cover-up}} and cozy bureaucratic collusion between industry and government, the last especially notorious in Japan <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> limited to that country. Even then, pro-nuclear power forces could prevail only by managing to instill in the minds of Japanese people a dichotomy between the physics of nuclear power and that of nuclear weapons, an illusory distinction made not only in Japan but throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|As {{indicated}} above, however, {{only two}} of the megillot are traditionally read in all Jewish communities, Esther on Purim and Lamentations on the Ninth of Av. The practice of reading the other three books on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals is widespread <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> universal. To read them is a venerable custom among Ashkenazim, but many Sephardic Jews do not associate the three books with the three festivals. The association is thus weaker also among Hasidic Jews who were influenced by Sephardic customs.|$|E

25|$|Evangelical Christians {{believe that}} {{religious}} pluralism is heresy and contradicts the Bible. Some Christians {{have argued that}} religious pluralism is an invalid or self-contradictory concept. Maximal forms of religious pluralism claim that all religions are equally true, or that one religion can be true for some and another for others. Some, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> all, Christians hold such pluralism to be logically impossible. Roman Catholicism believes that while it is the fullest and most complete revelation of God to Man, other Christian denominations have also received genuine revelation from God, although partial and incomplete.|$|E
25|$|However, the Patagonian giant frenzy was to {{die down}} {{substantially}} {{only a few}} years later, when some more sober and analytical accounts were published. In 1773 John Hawkesworth published on behalf of the Admiralty a compendium of noted English southern-hemisphere explorers' journals, including that of James Cook and John Byron. In this publication, drawn from their official logs, {{it became clear that the}} people Byron's expedition had encountered were no taller than , very tall <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> giants. Interest soon subsided, although awareness of and belief in the myth persisted in some quarters even up into the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is {{a central}} {{component}} of the Australian healthcare system. The scheme provides reimbursement to community pharmacy for the costs of dispensing prescription medicines prescribed {{in accordance with the}} PBS Schedule, a comprehensive but closed formulary. Drugs are added to the formulary on the basis of an assessment of comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness compared to the therapy most likely to be replaced in practice. The result is that where {{there is no evidence of}} incremental benefit, a drug may not be listed at a higher price than the comparator with the result that for many (<b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> all) drugs the prices for subsidy purposes are a great deal cheaper than in many other major markets.|$|E
