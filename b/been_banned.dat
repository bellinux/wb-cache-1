5|$|Lead, one of {{the leading}} causes of {{toxicity}} in waterfowl, has been known to cause die-offs of wild bird populations.

By 1919, the spent lead pellets from waterfowl hunting was positively identified as the source of waterfowl deaths. Lead shot has <b>been</b> <b>banned</b> for hunting waterfowl in several countries, including the US in 1991 and Canada in 1997.
