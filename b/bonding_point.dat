These composite regions are connected by bi-component fibres — a discontinuous domain of the material. Microstructural and mechanical characterization of this material was carried out with experimental and numerical modelling techniques. Two numerical modelling strategies were implemented: (i) traditional finite element (FE) and (ii) a new parametric discrete phase FE model to elucidate the mechanical behaviour and underlying mechanisms involved in deformation of these materials. In FE models the studied nonwoven material was treated as an assembly of two regions having distinct microstructure and mechanical properties: fibre matrix and <b>bond</b> <b>points.</b> The former is composed of randomly oriented core/sheath fibres acting as load-transfer link between composite <b>bond</b> <b>points.</b> Randomness of material’s microstructure was introduced in terms of orientation distribution function (ODF).

Using a local sum of vertical ([summation operator]BOv) and horizontal ([summation operator]BOh) Mayer bond orders, we proposed a new method to evaluate the competition between the shear and cohesive strengths of the interface. Coupled with the phenomenological theory of fracture, we define the ratio of RBO=[summation operator]BOh/[summation operator]BOv to assess the embrittlement trend of the interface related to sulfur doping or sulfur doping combined with Re substitution. It is shown that sulfur increases RBO by 121 % relative to the sulfur-free [gamma]/[gamma]' interface, which could induce interface embrittlement from the electron <b>bonding</b> <b>point</b> of view.

A new {{analytical}} model for cold and hot bond rolling of clad sheet unbounded before rolling is derived {{to investigate the}} stress field of the clad sheet at the roll gap by using the direct formulation without the Runge Kutta numerical method. Constant shear friction between the rolls and the clad sheet is assumed. Due to the clad sheet unbounded before rolling, double-layer sheets are not bonded {{at the entrance of}} the roll gap. Thus the stress field of the roll gap for this model is different from that for clad sheet bonded firmly before rolling.

30|$|Even {{after many}} <b>bonding</b> <b>points</b> among strands were {{destroyed}} by exposure, nails still passed through the strands, and the strand strength due to fiber strength was manifested. In other words, the density of OSB(aspen) was 0.63  g/cm 3 before exposure, and then decreased to 0.51  g/cm 3 after 5  years (Table  1). The thickness change increased to 15.6  % (Table  1). The reduced density and increased thickness change suggest the destruction of <b>bonding</b> <b>points.</b> However, the strand strength was effectively manifested and showed high nail resistance, and thus OSB retained high levels of shear load in one-plane even when only a few <b>bonding</b> <b>points</b> remained. On the other hand, particleboard is manufactured from particles that are much smaller than strands, and nails rarely pass through the particles. Therefore, particle strength due to fiber strength is rarely manifested. Before exposure, PB(PF) showed the highest shear load in one-plane because PB(PF) had a higher density than the other boards (Table  1). However, the density of PB(PF) was reduced to 0.66  g/cm 3 after 5  years, and the thickness change increased to 15.2  % (Table  1). The reduced density and increased thickness change suggest the destruction of <b>bonding</b> <b>points</b> between particles. Unlike strands, particles lack the fiber strength. This is why shear load in one-plane decreased in PB(PF). On the other hand, MDF is manufactured from fibers that are as small as particles, but the fibers are intertwined and have mutually high adhesion [17]. As a result, the <b>bonding</b> <b>points</b> were not destroyed, and MDF maintained both high density (Table  1) and nail resistance even after exposure.|$|R
30|$|The fiberboards showed {{much lower}} {{thickness}} change than particleboards and strandboards for 5 -year outdoor exposure (Table  6). Our previous reports have {{mentioned that the}} high durability of fiberboard against outdoor exposure is presumably because of its smooth surface, which prevents rainwater from penetrating and deteriorating the board [5, 6]. However, in this study, the F-MUF board showed large reduction in MOR and IB after the JIS Test B. Rainwater did not penetrate the board, but water penetrated the board when it was immersed in boiling water for 2  h, which destroyed the <b>bonding</b> <b>points</b> and reduced its MOR and IB. MUF resin is not durable for boiling water and <b>bonding</b> <b>points</b> were destroyed. However, because the F-MDI board uses MDI resin, which is durable for boiling water [23], boiling water penetrating the board did not destroy its <b>bonding</b> <b>points.</b> Therefore, the MOR and IB of the F-MDI board did not reduce.|$|R

40|$|Originating from {{a broken}} spatial {{inversion}} symmetry, ferroelectricity is a functionality of materials with an electric dipole that can be switched by external electric fields. Spontaneous polarization is a crucial ferroelectric property, and its amplitude {{is determined by the}} strength of polar structural distortions. Density functional theory (DFT) {{is one of the most}} widely used theoretical methods to study ferroelectric properties, yet it is limited by the levels of approximations in electron exchange-correlation. On the one hand, the local density approximation (LDA) is considered to be more accurate for the conventional perovskite ferroelectrics such as BaTiO 3 and PbTiO 3 than the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), which suffers from the so-called super-tetragonality error. On the other hand, GGA is more suitable for hydrogen-bonded ferroelectrics than LDA, which largely overestimates the strength of hydrogen bonding in general. We show here that the recently developed general-purpose strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA functional significantly improves over the traditional LDA/GGA for structural, electric, and energetic properties of diversely-bonded ferroelectric materials with a comparable computational effort, and thus enhances largely the predictive power of DFT in studies of ferroelectric materials.

The panels experienced 1 -year and 3 -month outdoor exposure periods in Shizuoka City, Japan. As the temperature increased, decrements of Ed retention increased. For the same relative humidity, deterioration of the wood-based panels increased with increasing temperature. The highest modulus of rupture (MOR) retention for all the panels was for the 40  °C treatment. As temperature increased, MOR retention tended to decrease. At the 80  °C treatment, MOR retention for particle board (PB) was less than 10  %. Compared to plywood (PW), retention of mat-formed boards declined.

A remarkable variety of candidate high-pressure ground states have been identified with an evolutionary crystal structure search, including a stable alkaline-earth monoboride oI 8 -CaB, a superconductor with an expected critical temperature (Tc) of 5. 5 K. We have extended our previous study of CaB 6 [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 102501 (2012) ] to nearby stoichiometries of CaB[6 +x], finding that extra boron further stabilizes the proposed B 24 units. Here an explanation is given for the transformation of cP 7 -CaB 6 into the more complex oS 56 and tI 56 polymorphs at high pressure. The stability of the known metallic tP 20 phase of CaB 4 at ambient pressure is explained from a crystal structure and chemical <b>bonding</b> <b>point</b> of view. The tP 20 structure is shown to destabilize at 19 GPa relative to a semiconducting MgB 4 -like structure due to chemical pressure from the metal ion.

The stability of all structures has been rationalized through comparison with alkaline-earth analogs, emphasizing {{the importance of the}} size of the metal ion for the stability of borides.

30|$|The {{investigation}} {{showed that}} both MOR and IB could be increased and {{the coefficient of}} variation could be reduced by lowering the air-injection pressure under 0.55  MPa. The lower air-injection pressure allowed isocyanate resin {{to remain in the}} board and reduced the local destruction of <b>bonding</b> <b>points.</b> Therefore, both MOR and IB of board no. 9 and board no. 10 were higher than those of board no. 8, and the coefficients of variation of board no. 9 and board no. 10 were smaller than those of board no. 8. However, MOR and IB of board no. 9 and board no. 10 were lower than those of board no. 5, and the coefficients of variation were larger. Lowering the air-injection pressure reduced the local destruction of <b>bonding</b> <b>points,</b> but some points were still destroyed. As high-moisture particles were used, the hydrophobic isocyanate resin did not penetrate into the particles, but remained on the surface. Therefore, the anchor effect of the isocyanate resin was not fully manifested presumably, resulting in reduced bonding strength. Moreover, air injection blew the isocyanate resin away from the particle surface and caused a local reduction of bonding strength, thereby presumably further reducing the bonding strength. The reduced bonding strength was lower than the vapor pressure. As a result, small local blowouts occurred and caused the local destruction of <b>bonding</b> <b>points.</b> Lowering the air pressure could prevent local destruction somewhat, but not entirely. An important future task is to prevent the local destruction of <b>bonding</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R

Hundreds of ceramic compounds possess the spinel crystal structure and exhibit a remarkable variety of properties, ranging from compounds that are electrical insulators to compounds that are superconducting, or from compounds with ferri- and antiferromagnetic behavior to materials with colossal magnetoresistive characteristics. The unique crystal structure of spinel compounds {{is in many ways}} responsible for the widely varying physical properties of spinels. The objective of this project is to investigate the nature of chemical <b>bonding,</b> <b>point</b> defects, and electronic structure in compounds with the spinel crystal structure. Our goal is to understand and predict the stability of the spinel structure as a function of chemical composition, stoichiometry, and cation disorder. The consequences of cation disorder in spinel materials can be profound.

Our studies provide insight into the mechanisms of point defect formation and cation disorder and their effects on the electronic band structure and crystal structure of spinel-structure materials. our ultimate objective is to develop a more substantive knowledge of the spinel crystal structure and to promote new and novel uses for spinel compounds.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{oriented}} towards {{the investigation of}} the opportunities for ‘positive futures’ in and through sport in Serbia. It critically explores the social significance of established and emerging sports—football (grassroots programme) and rugby league—in the challenging social context of Serbian society via the theoretical prism of social capital. Contemporary debate on sport’s social role, underlining its multidimensional capacity in the creation and maintenance of social capital and associated socially cohesive processes—social inclusion, social integration and active civic participation—in and through sport, is often instigated within the developed world academe, and has not been oriented to questioning the link between sport, social capital and community benefits in the contexts of ‘transitional’ societies residing at the European semi-periphery. This thesis seeks, hence, to address this void by examining the social implications of sport for a multitude of communities in the context of semi-peripheral Serbia. In particular, it investigates the extent to which, and the ways in which, selected sports foster or impede the creation of different forms of social capital instrumental in sport and community development, including the role of wider social and sport policy contexts in these endeavours. Methodologically, the study deploys a qualitative multiple-case study approach using semi-structured individual and group interviews in conjuction with content analysis of official documents and direct observation of selected cases. The exploration of evolving contexts of selected sports against the backdrop of Serbia suggests that the representation of different forms of social capital varies among researched cases relevant to their position within the meso sporting context and to specific traits of the wider social context. In this vein, as a dynamic and transferable social construct, social capital generated and maintained in and through explored sports floats between bonding and bridging points on an axis with linking social capital residing closer to the <b>bonding</b> <b>point</b> on this axis. In these constellations norms of reciprocity are positioned as the key cultural element of the emerging social capital models that assist in opening up the opportunities for expanding social cohesion via social inclusion, social integration and active civic participation. Likewise, the evidence from the study challenges a dominant social capital conceptual approach by portraying the ways cultural elements of the concept—trust and norms of reciprocity—are mutually interwoven, context-dependent and how they interact in their structural webs within extracted sport social capital models. As evidence from the research further shows, the nature of social capital in regard to the explored sports corresponds to the ways socially cohesive processes are established for different scale community benefits. Yet, the reflextion of the correlation between the nature of social capital and the nature of socially cohesive processes in and around selected sports indicates that bonding social capital generated in and through sport may have the capacity to maintain socially cohesive processes while an inherently positive association between bridging social capital and community benefits in and through sport in this particular social context needs to be revisited. Finally, in examining the environment for sport and community development in Serbia, it is indicative that a pro-social sport policy context should comprehensively account for the wider social relevance of sport and its ability to imbue bottom-up cultural change at both sport and society levels. This awarness is central to policy recommendations formulated in the conclusion of this thesis. 	 This study thus provides an original contribution to knowledge by probing the nexus between investigated sports and the nature of social capital created, the role, position and interrelatedness of distincitive structral and cultural social capital elements within the created sport social capital models, associated social benefits and pro-social sport policies in the semi-peripheral context of Serbia...|$|E
