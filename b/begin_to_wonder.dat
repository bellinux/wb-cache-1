5|$|As Stauffenberg flies back to Berlin, Olbricht {{refuses to}} {{mobilize}} the Reserve Army until he knows without a doubt that Hitler is dead (if Hitler isn't dead, Olbricht will be arrested for having the reserve army mobilized without Fromm's permission). Behind Olbricht's back, Mertz forges his signature and issues the orders anyway. With Operation Valkyrie underway, Stauffenberg and his fellow plotters order the arrest of Nazi party leaders and SS officers, convincing lower officers that the Party and the SS are staging a coup. As Army soldiers begin {{to take control of}} Berlin's government ministries, including SS headquarters, mid-level officers relaying the orders <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> which side they should be fighting for. Rumors reach Berlin that Hitler survived the blast, but Stauffenberg dismisses them as SS propaganda. Meanwhile, Fromm learns from Field Marshal Keitel that Hitler is still alive. The General refuses to join the plotters, resulting in them detaining him. Major Otto Ernst Remer of the Reserve Army prepares to arrest Goebbels, but is stopped when Goebbels connects him by phone to Hitler.|$|E

After a string of {{negative}} reviews in the press, Flo overhears three men in a barber's shop saying that he'll [...] "never produce another hit". Stung, he vows to have four hits on Broadway at the same time.|$|E

500|$|The {{first of}} more than a dozen Tornado prototypes took flight on 14 August 1974 at Manching, Germany; the pilot, Paul Millett stated of the occasion: [...] "Aircraft {{handling}} was delightful... the actual flight went so smoothly that I did <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> whether this was not yet another simulation". Flight testing led to the need for minor modifications. Airflow disturbances were responded to by re-profiling the engine intakes and the fuselage to minimise surging and buffeting experienced at supersonic speeds. Testing revealed that a nose-wheel steering augmentation system, connecting with the yaw damper, was necessary to counteract the destabilising effect produced by deploying the thrust reverser during landing rollouts. In August 1976, Soviet espionage activities were exposed trying to obtain information on the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Lindelof and Cuse hyped in September 2007 that [...] "Eggtown" [...] would {{conclude}} Kate's potential pregnancy. [...] After {{having sex}} {{a few times}} in the third season, Kate and Sawyer <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> if Kate is pregnant. [...] In [...] "Eggtown", Kate exclaims to Sawyer that she is not pregnant and Sawyer rejoices, causing Kate to become angry with him and suddenly leave the Barracks. [...] Evangeline Lilly was excited by Kate's new connection to Aaron. [...] Lilly has said that if she could choose to play another Lost character, it would be Claire because of Aaron. Now she gets to have Aaron while portraying Kate. [...] She also enjoyed Kate having more responsibility because it puts her in a different situation from previous seasons.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} match as league leaders, two points {{in front of}} second-placed Chelsea. Their {{previous}} league outing was a 3–1 win against Aston Villa on 16 October 2004. The victory extended Arsenal's unbeaten league run to 49 matches, which set a new English football record. On the same day, Manchester United played out a 0–0 draw against Birmingham City. United sat in sixth position, 11 points behind their opponents. Their inconsistency was documented by several newspapers in the build-up to the match; David Lacey wrote in The Guardian of 23 October 2004: [...] "Manchester United, it is said, are {{in a period of}} transition but if by Christmas they have not begun to pick up, their critics will <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> at what precise point does transition become decline." ...|$|E

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} {{before he was}} executed, Bundy granted an interview to James Dobson, a psychologist {{and founder of the}} Christian evangelical organization Focus on the Family. He used the opportunity to make new statements about violence in the media and the pornographic [...] "roots" [...] of his crimes. [...] "It happened in stages, gradually", he said. [...] "My experience with ... pornography that deals on a violent level with sexuality, is once you become addicted to it ... I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material. Until you reach a point where the pornography only goes so far ... where you <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> if maybe actually doing it would give that which is beyond just reading it or looking at it." [...] Violence in the media, he said, [...] "particularly sexualized violence", sent boys [...] "down the road to being Ted Bundys." [...] The FBI, he suggested, should stake out adult movie houses and follow patrons as they leave. [...] "You are going to kill me," [...] he said, [...] "and that will protect society from me. But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 1980s {{a fierce}} {{interchange}} {{took place between}} Gardner and Colin Wilson. [...] In The Quest for Wilhelm Reich Wilson wrote of this book(Gardner) writes about various kinds of cranks with the conscious superiority of the scientist, {{and in most cases}} one can share his sense of the victory of reason. But after half a dozen chapters this non-stop superiority begins to irritate; you <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> about the standards that make him so certain he is always right. He asserts that the scientist, unlike the crank, does his best to remain open-minded. So how can he be so sure that no sane person has ever seen a flying saucer, or used a dowsing rod to locate water? And that all the people he disagrees with are unbalanced fanatics? A colleague of the positivist philosopher A. J. Ayer once remarked wryly [...] "I wish I was as certain of anything as he seems to be about everything". Martin Gardner produces the same feeling. By Wilson's own account, up to that time he and Gardner had been friends, but Gardner took offence. In February 1989 Gardner wrote a letter published in The New York Review of Books describing Wilson as [...] "England’s leading journalist of the occult, and a firm believer in ghosts, poltergeists, levitations, dowsing, PK (psychokinesis), ESP, and every other aspect of the psychic scene". Shortly afterwards, Wilson replied, defending himself and adding [...] "What strikes me as so interesting is that when Mr. Gardner—and his colleagues of CSICOP—begin to denounce the 'Yahoos of the paranormal,' they manage to generate an atmosphere of such intense hysteria ...". Gardner in turn replied quoting his own earlier description of Wilson: [...] "The former boy wonder, tall and handsome in his turtleneck sweater, has now decayed into one of those amiable eccentrics for which the land of Conan Doyle is noted. They prowl comically about the lunatic fringes of science ..." ...|$|E
