40|$|Phase-pure nanocrystalline diamond {{thin films}} grown from plasmas of a hydrogen-poor carbon argon gas mixture have been {{analyzed}} regarding their hardness and elastic moduli {{by means of}} a microindentor and a scanning acoustic microscope. The films are superhard and the moduli rival single crystal diamond.

This gives strong evidence for the existence of solitary double bonds in the films. The hardness and elasticity of the films then are explained by the assumption, that the solitary double bonds interconnect the nanocrystals in the films, leading to an intergrain <b>boundary</b> <b>adhesion</b> <b>of</b> similar strength as the intragrain diamond cohesion.

40|$|A {{stability}} {{analysis of}} a viscous, incompressible, and electrically conducting liquid sodium flow in an annular linear induction electromagnetic pump for sodium coolant circulation of a Sodium Fast Reactor (SFR) was carried out when transverse magnetic fields permeate the sodium fluid across the narrow annular gap. Due to a negligible skin effect {{and the presence of}} a magnetic core outside the gap, radial magnetic field is assumed to be constant over the narrow channel gap, and the steady state solution of the axial velocity is obtained as a function of radius. Small perturbations for MHD fields were considered in sinusoidal form {{as a function of the}} angular frequency and wave number, and the resulting equations were linearized. The solutions of the perturbed equations were sought in the form of a linear combination of independent orthogonal functions in a non-dimensional radial interval (0, 1), and each orthogonal function was chosen to satisfy the <b>boundary</b> conditions <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> to the solid walls of the channel. Under the assumption that solutions of the equations were not oscillated rapidly according to the radial coordinate, finite numbers of orthogonal polynomials were considered. As a result, simultaneous equations with coefficients of steady-state solutions were arranged, and dispersion relations between angular frequency and wave number of perturbed state were sought. The imaginary part of the angular frequency was taken into consideration from the condition of existence of a nontrivial solution of the system, which leads to the relation between critical Reynolds number (Re-cr) and Hartmann number (H-a). In the present study, critical Reynolds number and wave numbers were plotted against the Hartmann number for a long wave perturbation; thus, it was shown that a magnetic field has a significant stabilizing effect on liquid sodium flow. close...|$|R

Methods: The extent <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> was documented in 216 patient procedures and evaluated in detail in an additional 73 patient procedures. We evaluated the nature <b>of</b> the <b>adhesion</b> and its possible causes, including the location <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> in injection sets, the effect of syringe type, and the effect of prerinsing of syringes with various solutions of non-radiolabeled sestamibi and 99 mTc-sestamibi.

Results: The degree <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> <b>of</b> 99 mTc-sestamibi to the in-jection set was found to be 20. 1 % 6 8. 0 %, with a range (10 th– 90 th percentiles) of 9 %– 31 %. The primary cause <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> appeared to be the lubricant used inside the syringe barrel. Evaluation of 6 different syringe types identified a brand with a lower adhesion rate.

With more reproducible residual activities, we have been able to achieve an approximately 20 % reduction in the dis-pensed dose of 99 mTc-sestamibi used in clinical procedures and a more consistent injected dose with less interpatient variation.

Because plasma proteins {{are excluded from}} these contact zones, we have termed them protected zones <b>of</b> <b>adhesion.</b> To determine whether platelets form similar protected zones <b>of</b> <b>adhesion,</b> gel-filtered platelets stimulated with thrombin or ADP were allowed to adhere to fibrinogen- or fibronectin-coated surfaces. The protein- coated surfaces with platelets attached were stained with either fluorochrome-conjugated goat anti-human fibrinogen or anti-human fibronectin antibodies, or with rhodamine-conjugated polyethylene glycol polymers. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that F(ab') 2 anti- fibrinogen (100 kD) did not penetrate into the contact zones between stimulated platelets and the underlying fibrinogen-coated surface, while Fab antifibrinogen (50 kD) and 10 kD polyethylene glycol readily penetrated and stained the substrate beneath the platelets. Thrombin- or ADP-stimulated platelets also formed protected zones <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> on fibronectin-coated surfaces. F(ab') 2 anti-fibronectin and 10 kD polyethylene glycol were excluded from these adhesion zones, indicating that they are much less permeable than those formed by platelets on fibrinogen-coated surfaces. The permeability properties of protected zones <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> formed by stimulated platelets on surfaces coated with both fibrinogen and fibronectin were similar to the zones <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> formed on fibronectin alone. mAb 7 E 3, directed against the alpha IIb beta 3 integrin blocked the formation <b>of</b> protected <b>adhesion</b> zones between thrombin-stimulated platelets and fibrinogen or fibronectin coated surfaces. mAb C 13 is directed against the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin on platelets. Stimulated platelets treated with this mAb formed protected zones <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> on surfaces coated with fibronectin.
