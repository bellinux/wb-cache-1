5|$|The last {{stage was}} the longest, at , and ran from Nantes {{to the small}} town of Ville-d'Avray, which lies between Versailles and Paris, instead of at the Parc des Princes velodrome. This was because of a <b>bylaw</b> forbidding road races to end on cycling tracks (a <b>bylaw</b> {{subsequently}} repealed in light of the race's success). Garin took his third stage win, and sealed overall victory by 2 hours 59 minutes 31 seconds: this remains the greatest margin of victory in the Tour de France. After celebrating with champagne, the riders cycled to Parc des Princes, where they made several laps of honour before an adoring crowd, to the sound of a bugle.|$|E
5|$|Residents of Moore Park, {{opposed to}} the notion of {{widening}} their small residential street, approached city council in September 1948 to request the new extension connect to Mount Pleasant Road instead. A petition of residents followed, and city council accepted the recommendations. <b>Bylaw</b> 17489, passed February 7, 1949, formally approved the project. Despite the loss of ten houses, this plan was carried out.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bylaws</b> are {{a single}} {{document}} containing laws (rules) by {{which members of}} an organization have agreed to be governed. <b>Bylaws</b> are different from other basic laws governing deliberative societies, charters, constitutions, rules of order, and standing rules. Drafting <b>bylaws</b> {{is similar to the}} study of parliamentary law. It is usually a committee assignment. <b>Bylaws</b> are a legal document and must be precisely worded. <b>Bylaws</b> contain rules that pertain to the following: the official name of the organization; the object or purpose of the organization; requirements for membership; officers and designations; designations of meetings; establishment, composition, powers, and special rules pertaining {{to the board of directors}} and executive board; auxiliaries, departments, divisions and financial matters; parliamentary authority; and methods for amending <b>bylaws.</b> (A set of <b>bylaws</b> for a fictitious organization is provided as a guide in drafting <b>bylaws.</b> Standard print, in parentheses, explains what should be contained in the specific article or section.

5|$|In the 2005 civic election, he {{was again}} elected, though his Richmond First party only won {{three of the}} eight seats. He unsuccessfully lobbied his fellow councillors to appoint him to fill one of Richmond's two seats at Metro Vancouver. With not even his own party members {{supporting}} him for the Metro Vancouver seat and finding himself being alone {{in a number of}} issues, such as supporting the SkyTrain line being elevated, opposing the tree preservation <b>bylaw,</b> and wanting to hire more police officers, Howard left the Richmond First party in February 2006 to be an independent.|$|E
5|$|Howard volunteered {{with the}} Richmond Minor Hockey Association for over 12 years, and was active with Tourism Richmond, the Richmond Chamber of Commerce, and the Real Estate Institute of BC. While {{his mother had}} served as an Alderwoman on the Richmond City Council, Howard's {{political}} career began with a civic <b>bylaw</b> election in October 2001. Howard, belonging to the civic political party Richmond Non-Partisan Association, was elected {{to one of the}} three available seats on the Richmond City Council. After less than a year on council, Howard left the Richmond Non-Partisan Association to join a new pro-business political party, Richmond First, which he saw as being less controlling and allowing him to make more independent decisions. He was re-elected in the November 2002 civic election, with his Richmond First party taking four of the eight council seats.|$|E
5|$|The Culinary Institute of America is {{a nonprofit}} {{organization}} governed by a 24-member board of trustees. These trustees are elected to three-year terms by the Members of the Corporation, the stakeholders of the CIA. Each trustee can serve a maximum of four terms. The board appoints the president and votes on major initiatives for operation of the college, including tuition and fees, nomination of new trustees, operating and capital budgets, planning, major construction projects, and <b>bylaw</b> changes and amendments.

5|$|To {{play for}} an inter-county GAA team, Canavan {{had to work}} around a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) <b>bylaw,</b> because of a dispute in his parish, Errigal Ciarán. Two clubs claimed to {{represent}} the parish, the established Ballygawley St. Ciaran's club and the newly formed club, then called Errigal Ciaran Naomh Malachai. Players from the Errigal team were not recognised as being GAA members, because the club failed to register correctly. Canavan registered {{as a member of}} the Killyclogher hurling club, even though he didn't play the sport, just so he would be eligible for selection for the Tyrone minors. Prior to that, he had not played legitimate club football, but had forged his way onto the Tyrone under-age teams with his performances at school level. The two clubs united under the banner of Errigal Ciaran two years later.|$|E
5|$|Keenly {{interested}} in the well-being of citizens and affairs related {{to the development of}} the growing town, he was nominated for and eventually elected to Edmonton Town Council as an alderman in 1903, finishing first of nine candidates, with 421 votes. His term was to last two years, but was truncated by a year by Edmonton's incorporation as a city, which meant that the entire city council was elected afresh in the 1904 election. In that election he was again elected to a two-year term, finishing first of seventeen candidates, but this time resigned one year into his term in order to run for mayor in the 1905 election. May's time on council included the time in which Alberta was incorporated as a province; as an alderman he voiced his support for a lavish celebration to be in Edmonton, which was to be the capital city of the new province. While sitting on council, he also voted against a proposed <b>bylaw</b> that would have permitted suffrage for women in civic elections; he had initially voted in favour of the law, but had later reconsidered and reversed his vote, effectively killing the bill. The vote previously had been in favour of the bill, by a margin of one vote.|$|E
5|$|On local issues, Howard was an {{advocate}} of opening Richmond to gambling facilities, {{which led to the}} River Rock Casino Resort. He was supportive of heritage preservation measures but opposed Richmond's tree preservation <b>bylaw.</b> He was the only one on council who preferred the elevated option for the Canada Line (then known as the Richmond-Airport-Vancouver Line), whereas the other councillors preferred the ground level option or no SkyTrain extension at all. He was {{an advocate}} for building a convention centre and the most ardent supporter of removing a 55-acre piece of land from the Agricultural Land Reserve as a possible location for it, though the removal was refused. When the possibility of the city constructing a speed-skating oval associated with the 2010 Winter Olympics came, Howard was a vocal supporter. He travelled to Lillehammer, Norway, in 2004 as part of a committee to investigate similar facilities built for the 1994 Winter Olympics. He also traveled to Pierrefonds, Quebec and Asia as part of the sister city program. He was not supportive of proposals to build a new soccer facility or financially contributing to tall ships tourism attractions. Because previous councils had made funding commitments {{at the expense of the}} city's reserve funds rather than the tax base, Howard's time on council was marked with consistent property tax increases around 3 to 4% each year. Howard unsuccessfully lobbied other councillors to hire more police officers. He became the subject of a lawsuit, along with other Richmond First councillors, alleging a conflict-of-interest occurred after they approved a rezoning allowing a controversial pub.|$|E

50|$|It {{was once}} common {{practice}} for organizations {{to have two}} separate governing documents, a constitution and <b>bylaws,</b> but this has fallen out of favor because of the ease of use, increased clarity, and reduced chance of conflict inherent in a single, unified document.

5|$|During {{his first}} term as mayor, Armstrong oversaw many issues that {{concerned}} the city. In March 1911, he expressed his support for a new city hall building to be built, expressing his dissatisfaction with the existing building that housed the council and civic employees, mentioning the ever-expanding number of staff. Later in that year, a committee would be formed concerning the issue, and a new structure would be planned with a planned cost of one million dollars. In July of that same year, he would sign a <b>bylaw</b> that would allow an American entrepreneur to establish a gas plant in the city, an issue that had been presented to council for debate several months prior. Later that year, {{the prospect of a}} municipal gas plant would also be supplied to city council. In July 1911, when, along with the city council, he dismissed a pair of city commissioners after months of debate. The firing triggered a by-election when alderman James H. McKinley would resign in protest to the action. In 1911, he also served as {{a vice president of the}} Union of Alberta Municipalities. Involved in national and provincial affairs, he voiced his support for a canal to be constructed in the Georgian Bay of Lake Huron, stating that the presence of such canal would improve the trading relations of Canada with the United States by allowing an easier route between the two countries. He also was in favour of a hydroelectric project in the Athabasca River. Additionally, during t{{his first term}} as mayor, Armstrong also oversaw the city's festivities on George V's coronation and moved to form a municipal purchasing department.|$|E
