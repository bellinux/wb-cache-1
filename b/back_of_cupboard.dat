50|$|Those records {{which had}} survived the voyage north were {{deposited}} again in Edinburgh Castle. But in 1662 the legal registers were transferred to the Laigh Hall below the Parliament Hall on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh, where parliamentary and other records from the Castle joined them in 1689. The move was partly designed to promote access to the records, but the accommodation was far from satisfactory and the archives were damaged by damp and vermin. Records were piled {{on the floor and}} the <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>cupboards</b> ran with damp. The great fire of 1700, which threatened the Parliament House, forced a temporary removal of the records to St Giles' church for safety. Although the Treaty of Union of 1707 specified that the public records were to remain in Scotland in all time coming, there was no public money available to provide adequate accommodation and supervision for them.|$|R

Maelzel, in {{disclosing}} {{the interior}} of the machine, sometimes slightly deviates from the routine which we have pointed out, yet reeler in any instance does he so deviate from it as to interfere with our solution. For example, he has been known to open, first of all, the drawer--but he never opens the main compartment without first closing the <b>back</b> door <b>of</b> <b>cupboard</b> No. 1--he never opens the main compartment without first pulling out the drawer--he never shuts the drawer without first shutting the main compartment--he never opens the <b>back</b> door <b>of</b> <b>cupboard</b> No. 1 while the main compartment is open--and the game of chess is never commenced until the whole machine is closed. Now if it were observed that never, in any single instance, did M. Maelzel differ from the routine we have pointed out as necessary to our solution, it {{would be one of the}} strongest possible arguments in corroboration of it--but the argument becomes infinitely strengthened if we duly consider the circumstance that he does occasionally deviate from the routine but never does so deviate as to falsify the solution.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Object {{search is}} an {{integral}} part of daily life, and in the quest for competent mobile manipulation robots it is an unavoidable problem. Previous approaches focus on cases where objects are in unknown rooms but lying out in the open, which transforms object search into active visual search. However, in real life, objects may be in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>cupboards</b> occluded by other objects, instead of conveniently on a table by themselves. Extending search to occluded objects requires a more precise model and tighter integration with manipulation. We present a novel generative model for representing container contents by using object co-occurrence information and spatial constraints. Given a target object, a planner uses the model to guide an agent to explore containers where the target is likely, potentially needing to move occluding objects to enable further perception. We demonstrate the model on simulated domains and a detailed simulation involving a PR 2 robot. I...|$|R

5|$|The Crown Jewels {{include two}} sceptres {{originally}} made for Mary of Modena, {{the wife of}} JamesII, in 1685: a gold sceptre with a cross known as the Queen Consort's Sceptre with Cross and another topped by a dove known as the Queen Consort's Ivory Rod with Dove, which, as the name suggests, is made of ivory. Unlike the sovereign's dove, this one has folded wings and is relatively small. It was last used by Queen Elizabeth, later known as the Queen Mother, at the coronation of her husband GeorgeVI in 1937. For the coronation of MaryII, the wife and joint sovereign of WilliamIII, a more elaborate gold sceptre with dove was commissioned in 1689.

40|$|Advertising and {{bulk buying}} is often {{suggested}} as prime contributers to why consumers buy grocery items they never use. In contrast, {{a study of}} 423 homemakers indicates the most unused products are ones that were bought for specific recipes or specific occasions that never arose. Because most of these products {{tend to be more}} specialized and less versatile, they are generally moved to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard</b> and forgotten. Based on detailed interviews, we then outline specific strategies to help consumers shop, use, and dispose of products more carefully and less wastefully. Cabinet Castaways: Why We Buy Products We Never Use Nearly everyone buys products they never actually use. These cabinet castaways and abandoned products are ones that gradually move steadily further back in the cupboard until they are lost, out of sight. The money and effort invested in these products is not trivial.

When they all repaired to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard</b> door in Mr. Audley's room to be measured, his head was found far above Edgar's mark at fourteen, and therewith he was lank and thin, not yet accustomed to the length of his own legs and arms, and seeming as if he was not meant to be seen undraped by his surplice. His features and face were of the family type, but a little smaller, and with much less of the bright rosy tinting; indeed, when not excited he was decidedly pale, and his eyes and hair were a little lighter than those of the rest. It was a refined, delicate, thoughtful face, pretty rather than handsome, and its only fault was a certain melancholy superciliousness or benignant pity for every one who did not belong to the flock of St. Matthew's.|$|R

60|$|Eager to tell Edmund how near she was, she {{stretched}} herself out, almost crept between the shelves, leant {{her head against}} the board on the opposite side, and was about to speak, when she found that it yielded in some degree to her touch. A gleam of hope darted across her, she drew back, fetched her light, tried with her hand, and found that the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard</b> was in fact a door, secured on her side by a wooden bolt, which there was no difficulty in undoing. Another push, and the door yielded below, but only so as to show that there must be another fastening above. Rose clambered up the shelves, and sought. Here it was! It was one of the secret communications that were by no means uncommon in old halls in those times of insecurity. Edmund might yet be saved! Trembling with the excess of her delight in her new-found hope, she forced out the second bolt, and pushed again. The door gave way, the light widened upon her, and she saw into the room! Edmund was lying on the bed, Walter sitting at his feet.|$|R
40|$|Drawing on {{notions of}} obsolescence, {{redundancy}} and supersession, this paper examines the perpetual upgrade economy of digital games {{with reference to}} the archiving of gameplay in player-produced “walkthrough” texts. In concentrating on these largely overlooked documents, we draw attention to a variety of disruptive and resistant practices that exploit, explore, dissect, and above all, linger on the “old games” that videogame advertisers and marketers would perhaps rather see resigned to the bargain bucket or the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard.</b> It {{has become something of a}} cliché to talk of “disruptive” fan practices yet we feel there is merit in aggrandising the production of walkthroughs in this manner. Walkthroughs present and promote unexpected and, indeed, unintended, ways of engaging with digital games that question where game expertise lies, the forms of authority and governance that exist, and above all the flexibility and mutability of games as systems open to investigation, informal customisation and reinvention through often self-consciously exploratory (re) play. Further, in pausing and focusing on specific (areas of) games in detail, even interrogating their malfunctions through glitch- and bug-hunting, walkthroughs might be seen to arrest the otherwise relentless flow of completion and discarding as they encourage the development of new ways of playing (and reasons to play) old games. It is our assertion that player-produced walkthrough texts are essentially documents that codify and archive a slow media approach to gameplay and gaming cultur...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, 208 {{furniture}} and 168 coopered vessels from three Austrian museums were examined. Dendrochronology {{was used to}} date objects and to extract further information such as the necessary time for seasoning, wood loss through wood-working and methods of construction. In most cases sampling was done by sanding the cross section and making digital photographs using a picture frame and measuring digitally. The dendrochronological dates of the sampled furniture range between 1524 and 1937. The group <b>of</b> furniture includes <b>cupboards,</b> chests, tables, benches, commodes and beds. In many cases furniture was artfully painted and sometimes even shows a painted year. With the help of dendrochronology it was proved that some objects had been painted for some time after construction, or had been over-painted. Most furniture, however, was painted immediately after completion. In this case, the seasoning and storage time of the boards and the wood loss due to shaping can be verified. As an average value, 14 years have passed between the dendrochronological date of the outermost ring and the painting. The time span includes time of seasoning and storage and the rings lost by wood-working. This leads, {{on the one hand}} to a short storage time of less than 10 years {{and on the other hand}} to very little wood loss due to manufacturing. Those boards being less shaped turned out to be <b>back</b> panels <b>of</b> <b>cupboards,</b> therefore they are recommended to be sampled for dating. Coopered vessels were dated between 1612 and 1940. There was evidence that staves were split and not sawn in many cases. The staves were often split out of the outermost part of the tree and hardly any wood was worked away which was proved by the close dendrochronological dates of the single staves of a vessel. Since there is a short time of storage and only little wood loss through wood-working, dating of objects without a waney edge becomes reasonable...|$|R
