5|$|In Catholicism, {{there has}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{tradition}} of veneration of the heart, stemming from {{worship of the}} wounds of Jesus Christ which gained prominence from the mid sixteenth century.

5|$|The {{decipherment}} {{and recovery}} of the knowledge of Maya writing has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and laborious process. Some elements were first deciphered in the late 19th and early 20th century, mostly the parts {{having to do with}} numbers, the Maya calendar, and astronomy. Major breakthroughs were made from the 1950s to 1970s, and accelerated rapidly thereafter. By the end of the 20th century, scholars were able to read the majority of Maya texts, and ongoing work continues to further illuminate the content.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{began to}} play with purpose once going behind, {{but for the rest}} of the half {{struggled}} to get the better of Luton's defence. A long ball by Davis sent Rocastle charging forward in the 16th minute, and momentarily upset Luton's shape, but it was caught by Dibble. The Luton goalkeeper was again called into action when Arsenal were awarded a set piece; Sansom slid the ball to Nigel Winterburn, whose shot was gathered. Foster made a timely challenge on Davis on the edge of the penalty area to end another Arsenal attack; Graham's team had been more threatening on right-hand flank with Rocastle and Winterburn. Harford, who had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> figure up front for Luton, still managed to trouble the Arsenal defence with little service; near the end of the first half, he collected a pass from the left, bypassed his marker Adams and aimed his shot at goal, which went wide of the right-hand post.|$|E

Ryan Chavez drummed on the band's fifth studio album, Stay Down, released in 2008 through Curb Appeal Records. Neil Hennessy of fellow Chicago punk rock band The Lawrence Arms became the Smoking Popes' permanent drummer {{prior to the}} album's release.

5|$|The {{result of}} these changes has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and complex road to {{responsible}} government. Effectively providing services and representation for the population has been a particular challenge for the Territories' government, a task often complicated by the region's vast and changing geographic area. A small number of communities in Northwest Territories have unsuccessfully tried to become the capital over the years. The territory has had the seat of government outside of its territorial boundaries twice in its history. The only other political division in Canada without a seat of government inside its own boundaries was the defunct District of Keewatin that existed from 1876 until 1905.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked how}} he, {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E

25|$|Equestrianism has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> tradition, {{popular among}} the Tsars and aristocracy, {{as well as}} part of {{military}} training.

25|$|Metrication or metrification is {{conversion}} to the metric {{system of units}} of measurement. Worldwide, there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> process of independent conversions of countries from various local and traditional systems, beginning in France during the 1790s and spreading widely over the following two centuries, but the metric system has not been fully adopted in all countries and sectors.|$|E
