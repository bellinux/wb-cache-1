40|$|Abstract. Philosophers of {{language}} distinguish among the lexical or linguistic {{meaning of the}} sentence uttered, what <b>is</b> <b>said</b> by an utterance of the sentence, and speaker's meaning, or what is conveyed by the speaker to her audience. In most views, what <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> the semantic or truth-conditional content of the utterance, and is irreducible either to the linguistic meaning or to the speaker's meaning. I will show that those views account badly for people's intuitions on what <b>is</b> <b>said.</b> It will also argue that no distinguished level of what <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> required, and {{that the notion of}} linguistic meaning is the best placed {{to play the role of}} what <b>is</b> <b>said.</b> This relies on two points. First, our intuitions on what <b>is</b> <b>said</b> cannot <b>be</b> detached from the ways in which we talk about what <b>is</b> <b>said,</b> and from the semantics of speech reports and indirect discourse in general.

5|$|As {{was often}} the case with Celtic churches from this period, the church was {{associated}} with a well. It was built by the monks of Penmon and was believed to have healing powers by some people visiting it. It {{is probably one of the}} oldest buildings in Penmon. It has <b>been</b> <b>said</b> that the lower stone walls near the well were part of Seiriol's church in the 6th century; if so, this would make it the oldest remaining Christian building in Wales. A small chamber surrounds the well. In modern times, water from the well has been used as a symbol of Anglesey by the island's representatives at the launch ceremony of the 10th International Island Games (held in Guernsey in June 2003) and the 11th Island Games (held in the Shetland Islands in July 2005).|$|E

It has long <b>been</b> <b>said</b> that a Hollywood adaptation was first {{suggested by the}} entertainer Harpo Marx, who had seen a dramatisation of the novel in Philadelphia in 1935, but the story is of doubtful accuracy. Directed by Robert Z. Leonard and written {{in collaboration with the}} English novelist Aldous Huxley and American screenwriter Jane Murfin, the film was critically well-received, although the plot and characterisations strayed from Austen's original. Filmed in a studio and in black and white, the story's setting was relocated to the 1830s with opulent costume designs.|$|E
