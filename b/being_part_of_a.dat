5|$|Battles use a turn-based battle system, {{with the}} player, enemies, and {{sometimes}} non-playable characters each taking turns and moving across a grid-based battlefield: battles are {{won by the}} player defeating all enemies in a map or killing a boss character. Enemies include human troops and monsters. The players are given {{a limited number of}} units, which are each assigned unique character classes that have various functions in battle, such as being mounted or having access to magic. A unit's class also affects their range of movement on the battlefield. In contrast to the previous game, character classes are not set but can switch once a character reaches a certain level. A special example of class promotion is the two main characters: Alm can promote from a Fighter to a Hero, while Celica promotes from a Priestess to a Princess. Each time a unit raises its experience level, its various stats increase based on a percent chance unique for each character. Spells for magical classes are learned through leveling up rather than <b>being</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> separate system, and each spell consumes part of the caster's health when used.|$|E

The work was likely composed at Winchester.|$|E
