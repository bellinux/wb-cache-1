2500|$|Another {{variant of}} form-milling {{involves}} holding the cutter's axis orthogonally (no canting to the thread's helix angle) and feeding the cutter in a toolpath that will generate the thread. The part {{is usually a}} stationary workpiece, such as a boss on a valve body (in external thread milling) or a hole in a plate or block (in internal thread milling). This type of thread milling uses essentially the same concept as contouring with an endmill or <b>ball-nose</b> mill, but the cutter and toolpath are arranged specifically to define the [...] "contour" [...] of a thread. The toolpath is achieved either using helical interpolation (which is circular interpolation in one plane [...] with simultaneous linear interpolation along a third axis the CNC control model must be one that supports using the third axis) or a simulation of it using extremely small increments of 3-axes linear interpolation (which is not practical to program manually but can be programmed easily with CAD/CAM software). The cutter geometry reflects the thread pitch but not its lead; the lead (thread helix angle) {{is determined by the}} toolpath. Tapered threads can be cut either with a tapered multiple-form cutter that completes the thread in one revolution using helical interpolation, or with a straight or tapered cutter (of single- or multiple-form) whose toolpath is one or more revolutions but cannot use helical interpolation and must use CAD/CAM software to generate a contour-like simulation of helical interpolation.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, flat, <b>ball-nose,</b> roughing, and tapered endmilling {{tools are}} {{investigated}} for their respective wear trends. These curves are {{contrasted with the}} trend exhibited by traditional flat endmills. To isolate the wear behavior of the various tool geometries, an autoregressive based monitoring algorithm is used to track the tool's condition using a tri-axial accelerometer. An accelerometer is used due to its low cost and since it does not limit the machining envelope. To demonstrate repeatability, eight life tests were conducted (two life tests {{for each type of}} endmill). The technique discussed herein successfully identifies impending fracture or meltdown due to wear in all cases, providing sufficient time to remove the tools before failure is realized. Furthermore, the algorithm produces similar trends capable of forecasting failure, regardless of tool geometry, in all cases, without requiring algorithm modifications or a priori information regarding the cutting conditions...|$|E
40|$|In die and mould manufacturing, {{the method}} used for quality control of {{finished}} surfaces is usually visual and tactile inspection of the finish, which is not easily quantifiable. In the present study, {{an evaluation of the}} connection between surface finish appearance and measured surface roughness was carried out using scale-sensitive fractal analysis to find functional correlations and to determine suitable cut-off limits for functional data filtration. A selection of <b>ball-nose</b> end-mills in combination with two different tool steels (hardness 39 and 47 HRC) were used to manufacture surfaces that were inspected and measured. It was found that the method developed in the present study for evaluating functional correlations and designing filters worked well. It was also found that there is a correlation between the surface roughness parameter Sq and the surface finish appearance and that this correlation is stronger in certain wavelengths on the surface...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in conventional incremental sheet forming (ISF) is the extreme sheet thinning resulted in an uneven thickness distribution of formed part. This {{is also the case}} for incrementally formed parts with hole-flanging features. To overcome this problem, a new ISF based hole-flanging processing method is proposed by developing a new ISF flanging tool. Comparative studies are conducted by performing hole-flanging tests using both ISF conventional <b>ball-nose</b> tool and the new flanging tool to evaluate the sheet deformation behavior {{and the quality of the}} final part. Stress distribution and strain variation are investigated by analytical approach and numerical simulation. Experiments have been conducted to validate the analytical model and simulation results, and to further study the fracture behavior. Results show that the new flanging tool generates greater meridional bending than stretching deformation in conventional ISF. The combination of bending-dominated deformation mode with localized deformation of ISF ensures more uniform thickness distribution on hole-flanging part with better resistance to fracture...|$|E
40|$|Brass layer {{formation}} and hardness degradation during the {{resistance spot welding}} of hot-dipped galvanized steel was characterized {{for a number of}} copper-based electrode materials and electrode geometries as part of an overall program to increase electrode life through the analysis of electrode wear. Metallographic, composition, and hardness examinations were conducted on electrodes subjected to single-current and stepped-current life tests. The electrode wear sequence was documented via sequential life testing, in which electrodes were removed for testing and examination at established intervals during single-current testing. Testing was conduced on truncated-cone and <b>ball-nose</b> electrode geometries. Electrode materials included a Class 2 precipitation-hardened copper-zirconium, as well as two new proprietary electrode materials: one precipitation hardened, and the other second phase strengthened. Characterization included the effect of electrode geometry and composition on alloying and hardness retention. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|Free-form {{surfaces}} {{are being used}} in {{a growing number of}} engineering applications, especially in injection molding of consumer products. Decreasing the manufacturing cost and time of these molds will improve the efficiency of manufacturing injection molded consumer products. This paper is motivated by the need for simple strategies {{to improve the quality of}} and decrease the time required to machine free-form surfaces. We present two methods to improve the surface finish of parts finished with <b>ball-nose</b> endmilling. In the first method the surface finish is improved by finding an optimal orientation angle for the workpiece relative to the machining axis. In the second method finish is improved by adaptively varying the step-size when using raster toolpaths. The adaptive variation is controlled by a user-defined finish improvement factor, where the spacing density is increased only if the improvement in surface finish is greater than the finish improvement factor. These methods are implemented using an analytical model of the workpiece surface finish based on the mean scallop height of the machined surface. Results from the analytical model are verified with machining experiments, and we show that the adaptive spacing strategy can improve the surface quality by more than 50 % with a small increase in the toolpath length. To achieve a similar improvement in surface quality by uniformly decreasing the path spacing results in a much larger increase in the toolpath length. The strategies discussed in this paper allow process planners intuitive control over the toolpath layout and spacing and improve the efficiency of machining high quality parts...|$|E
