Advantages associated with a large <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> include higher breakdown voltages, ability to sustain large electric fields, lower electronic noise, and high-temperature and high-power operation. The bandgap of ZnO can further be tuned to ~3–4eV by its alloying with magnesium oxide or cadmium oxide.|$|E
5|$|All {{the above}} Raman modes can be {{observed}} both as Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering. As mentioned above, Raman scattering from CNTs is resonant in nature, i.e. only tubes whose <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> energy {{is similar to the}} laser energy are excited. The difference between those two energies, and thus the <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> of individual tubes, can be estimated from the intensity ratio of the Stokes/anti-Stokes lines. This estimate however relies on the temperature factor (Boltzmann factor), which is often miscalculated – a focused laser beam is used in the measurement, which can locally heat the nanotubes without changing the overall temperature of the studied sample.|$|E

40|$|In the review, {{peculiarities of}} spectra of {{one-dimensional}} photonic crystals made of anisotropic and/or magnetooptic materials are considered. The {{attention is focused}} on <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> of a special type—the so called degenerate <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> which are degenerate with respect to polarization. Mechanisms of formation and properties of these <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> are analyzed. Peculiarities of spectra of photonic crystals that arise due to the linkage between <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> are discussed. Particularly, it is shown that formation of a frozen mode is caused by linkage between Brillouin and degenerate <b>band</b> <b>gaps.</b> Also, existence of the optical Borrmann effect at the boundaries of degenerate <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> and optical Tamm states at the frequencies of degenerate <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> are analyzed...|$|R

40|$|This Letter {{presents}} {{a study of}} the local density of states (LDOS) in photonic quasicrystals. We show that the LDOS of a Penrose-type quasicrystal exhibits small additional <b>band</b> <b>gaps.</b> Among the <b>band</b> <b>gaps,</b> some exhibit a behavior similar to that typical of photonic crystals, while others do not. The development of certain <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> requires large-size quasicrystals. It is explained by the long-range interactions involved in their formation. Moreover, the frequencies where the <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> occur are not necessarily explained using single scattering and should therefore involve multiple scattering. © 2005 The American Physical Society...|$|R

Cadmium telluride (CdTe) is used in solar modules for its high conversion efficiency, low manufacturing costs, and large <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> of 1.44 eV, letting it absorb {{a wide range of}} wavelengths. Bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3), alloyed with selenium and antimony, is a component of thermoelectric devices used for refrigeration or portable power generation.|$|E
5|$|The partly ionic {{structure}} of BN layers in h-BN reduces covalency and electrical conductivity, whereas the interlayer interaction increases resulting in higher hardness of h-BN relative to graphite. The reduced electron-delocalization in hexagonal-BN is also indicated by its absence {{of color and}} a large <b>band</b> <b>gap.</b> Very different bonding – strong covalent within the basal planes (planes where boron and nitrogen atoms are covalently bonded) and weak between them – causes high anisotropy of most properties of h-BN.|$|E
5|$|At higher {{temperatures}} tellurium {{is sufficiently}} plastic to extrude. It melts at 449.51°C. Crystalline tellurium has a structure consisting of parallel infinite spiral chains. The bonding between adjacent atoms {{in a chain}} is covalent, but {{there is evidence of}} a weak metallic interaction between the neighbouring atoms of different chains. Tellurium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 1.0S•cm−1 and a <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> of 0.32 to 0.38eV. Liquid tellurium is a semiconductor, with an electrical conductivity, on melting, of around 1.9 × 103S•cm−1. Superheated liquid tellurium is a metallic conductor.|$|E

However, optical <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> of the ZnO–laali and ZnO–zobo shifted towards the red and blue regions, respectively, when compared with that of ordinary ZnO nanoparticle.

Germanium also reacts with molten caustic soda to yield sodium germanate Na2GeO3 and hydrogen gas. It melts at 938°C. Germanium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 2 × 10−2S•cm−1 and a <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> of 0.67eV.

5|$|Some of astatine's {{reported}} {{properties are}} nonmetallic. It has the narrow liquid range ordinarily associated with nonmetals (mp 302°C; bp 337°C). Batsanov gives a calculated <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> energy for astatine of 0.7eV; {{this is consistent}} with nonmetals (in physics) having separated valence and conduction bands and thereby being either semiconductors or insulators. The chemistry of astatine in aqueous solution is mainly characterised by the formation of various anionic species. Most of its known compounds resemble those of iodine, which is a halogen and a nonmetal. Such compounds include astatides (XAt), astatates (XAtO3), and monovalent interhalogen compounds.|$|E

It is stable in dry air but develops a golden bronze patina in moist air, which blackens on further exposure. Arsenic is attacked by nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. It reacts with fused caustic soda {{to give the}} arsenate Na3AsO3 and hydrogen gas. Arsenic sublimes at 615°C. The vapour is lemon-yellow and smells like garlic. Arsenic only melts under a pressure of 38.6 atm, at 817°C. It is a semimetal with an electrical conductivity of around 3.9 × 104S•cm−1 and a band overlap of 0.5eV.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the existence of}} large phononic <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> in designed hyperuniform (isotropic) disordered two-dimensional (2 D) phononic structures of Pb cylinders in epoxy matrix. The phononic <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> in hyperuniform disordered phononic structures are comparable to <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> of similar periodic structures, for both out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations. A large number of localized modes is identi ed near the band edges, as well as, di usive transmission {{throughout the rest of}} the frequency spectrum. Very high-Q cavity modes for both out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations are formed by selectively removing a single cylinder out of the structure. E cient waveguiding with almost 100 % transmission trough waveguide structures with arbitrary bends is also presented. We expand our results to thin three-dimensional layers of such structures and demonstrate e ective <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> related to the respective 2 D <b>band</b> <b>gaps.</b> Moreover, the drop in the Q factor for the three-dimensional structures is not more than three orders of magnitude compared to the 2 D ones...|$|R
5|$|Diamonds {{containing}} boron as a substitutional impurity are termed type IIb. Only {{one percent}} of natural diamonds are of this type, and most are blue to grey. Boron is an acceptor in diamond: boron atoms have one less available electron than the carbon atoms; therefore, each boron atom substituting for a carbon atom creates an electron hole in the <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> that can accept an electron from the valence band. This allows red light absorption, and due to the small energy (0.37 eV) needed for the electron to leave the valence band, holes can be thermally released from the boron atoms to the valence band even at room temperatures. These holes can move in an electric field and render the diamond electrically conductive (i.e., a p-type semiconductor). Very few boron atoms are required for this to happen—a typical ratio is one boron atom per 1,000,000 carbon atoms.|$|E
5|$|Dislocations are {{the most}} common {{structural}} defect in natural diamond. The two major types of dislocations are the glide set, in which bonds break between layers of atoms with different indices (those not lying directly above each other) and the shuffle set, in which the breaks occur between atoms of the same index. The dislocations produce dangling bonds which introduce energy levels into the <b>band</b> <b>gap,</b> enabling the absorption of light. Broadband blue photoluminescence has been reliably identified with dislocations by direct observation in an electron microscope, however, it was noted that not all dislocations are luminescent, and there is no correlation between the dislocation type and the parameters of the emission.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the relativistic contraction and binding of the 7s subshell, the 6d5/2 orbital {{is expected to be}} destabilized due to spin-orbit coupling, making it behave similarly to the 7s orbital in terms of size, shape, and energy. Hence copernicium may not be a noble metal, but rather a semiconductor with a <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> of around 0.2eV. Copernicium is expected to crystallize in the hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, with lattice parameters a=332pm and c=540pm. The c/a ratio of 1.63 is the ideal value, establishing a kinship between solid copernicium and the solid noble gases, though its cohesive energy (enthalpy of crystallization) should be on the order of that of mercury rather than be near the lower value of the noble gases.|$|E

5|$|Synthetic diamond has {{potential}} uses as a semiconductor, {{because it can}} be doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one less valence electron than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into p-type or n-type semiconductor. Making a p–n junction by sequential doping of synthetic diamond with boron and phosphorus produces light-emitting diodes (LEDs) producing UV light of 235nm. Another useful property of synthetic diamond for electronics is high carrier mobility, which reaches 4500cm2/(V·s) for electrons in single-crystal CVD diamond. High mobility is favourable for high-frequency operation and field-effect transistors made from diamond have already demonstrated promising high-frequency performance above 50GHz. The wide <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> of diamond (5.5 eV) gives it excellent dielectric properties. Combined with the high mechanical stability of diamond, those properties are being used in prototype high-power switches for power stations.|$|E
5|$|ZnO has wide direct <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> (3.37 eV or 375nm at room temperature). Therefore, {{its most}} common {{potential}} applications are in laser diodes and {{light emitting diodes}} (LEDs). Some optoelectronic applications of ZnO overlap with that of GaN, which has a similar bandgap (~3.4 eV at room temperature). Compared to GaN, ZnO has a larger exciton binding energy (~60 meV, 2.4 times of the room-temperature thermal energy), which results in bright room-temperature emission from ZnO. ZnO can be combined with GaN for LED-applications. For instance as transparent conducting oxide layer and ZnO nanostructures provide better light outcoupling. Other properties of ZnO favorable for electronic applications include its stability to high-energy radiation and its possibility to be patterned by wet chemical etching. Radiation resistance makes ZnO a suitable candidate for space applications. ZnO is the most promising candidate {{in the field of}} random lasers to produce an electronically pumped UV laser source.|$|E

40|$|The band {{edges and}} <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> of (InAs) n/(GaSb) m (n,m= 1, 20) superlattices have been {{theoretically}} studied through the plane-wave empirical pseudopotential method for different situations: (i) different substrates, GaSb and InAs; (ii) different point group symmetries, C 2 v and D 2 d; and (iii) different growth directions, (001) and (110). We find that (a) the <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> for the (001) C 2 v superlattices on a GaSb substrate exhibit a nonmonotonic {{behavior as a}} function of the GaSb barrier thickness when the number of (InAs) n layers exceed n= 5; (b) substrate effects: compared with the GaSb substrate, the different strain field generated by the InAs substrate leads to a larger variation of the <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> for the (001) C 2 v superlattices {{as a function of}} the InAs well thickness; (c) effect of the type of interfacial bonds: the In-Sb bonds at the interfaces of the (001) D 2 d superlattices partially pin the band edge states, reducing the influence of the confinement effects on electrons and holes, and lowering the <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> as compared to the (001) C 2 v case. The valence band maximum of the (001) D 2 d superlattices with Ga-As bonds at the interfaces are shifted down, increasing the <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> as compared to the (001) C 2 v case; (d) effect of layer orientation: the presence of In-Sb bonds at both interfaces of the (110) superlattices pin the band edge states and reduces the <b>band</b> <b>gaps,</b> as compared to the (001) C 2 v case. An anticrossing between the electron and hole levels in the (110) superlattices, for thin GaSb and thick InAs layers, leads to an increase of the <b>band</b> <b>gaps,</b> {{as a function of the}} InAs thickness; (e) superlattices vs random alloys: the comparison between the band edges and <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> of the superlattices on a GaSb substrate and those for random alloys, lattice matched to a GaSb substrate, as a function of the In composition, shows that the random alloys present almost always higher <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> and give a clear indication of the effect of superlattice's ordering and period on the behavior of the <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> and <b>band</b> edges. Inclusion of interfacial interdiffusion, using the approach of Magri and Zunger [Phys. Rev.
