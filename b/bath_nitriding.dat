40|$|The area of micro-abrasion is an {{interesting}} and relatively recent area in tribo-testing methodologies, where small particles of less than 10 mm are employed between interacting surfaces. It is topical {{for a number of}} reasons; its direct relation to the mechanisms of the wear process in bio-tribological applications, ease in conducting tests and the good repeatability of the test results. It has widespread applications in conditions used in the space and offshore industries to bio-engineering for artificial joints and implants. There have been many recent studies on the micro-abrasion performance of materials, ranging from work basic metals to nanostructured coatings. However, no significant work is reported on the micro-abrasion resistance of thermochemically treated steels. Hence, this paper looks at the performance of two thermochemically treated steels, Tenifer <b>bath</b> <b>nitride</b> stainless steel (T-SS) and vanadized carbon steel (V-CS) in such conditions with reference to the stainless steel (SS) by varying the applied load and sliding distance. The results indicated that T-SS demonstrates exceptionally poor resistance to micro-abrasion. It was observed that the heat treatment process and properties of the hardened layer (hardness and thickness) are extremely important in determining the micro-abrasion resistance of such steels. Finally, the results were used to develop micro-abrasion mechanism and wastage maps, which can be used to optimize the surface treated materials for micro-abrasion resistance.

40|$|Abstract: Energetic {{nitrogen}} implantation into 316 LN {{stainless steels}} or nickel-chromium alloys {{leads to the}} formation of a very hard and wear resistant surface layer with an expanded lattice. Austenitic stainless steels can be hardened at temperatures around 450 - 5500 C using energetic nitrogen into ion implantation while retaining the corrosion resistance. The expanded austenite is characterized by a concentration dependent diffusion coefficient, strongly increasing at higher nitrogen concentrations. A comparison of the phase formation under identical process conditions at 4500 C were nitrided and investigated at different time parameters. Low temperature salt <b>bath</b> <b>nitriding</b> of austenitic stainless steels can produce a specified nitrided layer with high hardness and good corrosion resistance.

40|$|Forging dies {{are exposed}} to thermal, mechanical, {{tribological}} and chemical stress during use. This results in high abrasive and adhesive die wear which limits the die lifetime. The lifetime can be prolonged by means of appropriate surface treatments. Laser beam surface treatment techniques offer several advantages compared to conventional procedures: they allow an efficient, local modification of the surface layer which can be adjusted to the actual wear types. Within the research activities selected forging dies were laser alloyed/dispersed {{in order to reduce}} the abrasive wear. The dies were subsequently plasma nitrided to decrease the adhesive wear. The optimal combination of such surface treatments was determined via an iterative evaluation of alloying material, process development and die application under industrial conditions in forging companies. The findings up to now show that the die lifetime can be increased from 50 % to 300 %. Some areas of improvement still remain before this technique can be used at industrial level: the process know-how is insufficient as regards laser alloying/dispersing of specific die areas such as radii and edges; difference of results between nitriding processes (plasma, salt <b>bath</b> and gas <b>nitriding)</b> are not well-known in combination with laser pre-treated die surfaces at the moment; a classification of forging dies is required depending on die geometry, strain, material flow path, formed material, etc. The technology of laser alloying/dispersing needs to be made reliable, reproducible and accessible to the forging industry at reasonable costs.

40|$|It is well {{understood}} that the introduction of nitrogen into metallic surfaces improves the mechanical properties of engineering components, such as hardness, wear and fatigue {{as well as the}} corrosion resistance. In addition to conventional techniques such as salt <b>bath</b> and gas <b>nitriding</b> there are currently several methods which utilise plasma environments for mass transfer, e. g. D C plasma nitriding, R F plasma nitriding and plasma immersionion implantation (PI 3). It was the main aim of this investigation to study the plasma nitriding behaviour of a commercially available chromium bearing microalloyed steel, MAXIMA™, in the hot rolled and air cooled condition. The ultimate goal was to assess the possibility of using it as an alternative to conventional quenched and tempered nitriding steels, such as En 19 (AISI 4140) which was used as a reference in this investigation. In order to identify themost suitable gas mixture for the nitriding of MAXIMA™, a comprehensive investigation of DC plasma nitriding at 450 °C was performed by varying the hydrogen concentration in the nitriding atmosphere and examining the structure and the properties of the surface layers. A detailed study of RF plasma nitriding and PI 3 was undertaken using MAXIMA™ steel. In order to gain an insight into the influence of different modes of plasma generation on the formation of the hardened layer and the mass transfer mechanisms involved, a comparison was also made with DC plasma nitriding. All the experiments were conducted on MAXIMA™ steel for five hours at the temperatures of 350, 400, 450, 500 and 550 °C. Optical, scanning electron and atomic force microscopy, in conjunction with microhardness and surface roughness measurements were employed to characterise the nitrided surfaces. X-ray diffraction, both in normal and glancing angle configurations and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy were also utilised to identify the phases that formed on the surface of nitrided specimens and the concentration profiles of different elements. It was found that DC plasma nitriding of MAXIMA™ at all temperatures developed cases with higher surface hardness and roughness, and a slightly thinner compound layer and diffusion zone than those obtained from Enl 9 steel. A comparative study between PI 3 and RF plasma nitriding revealed that the PI 3 process produced surface layers with more favourable properties, such as higher hardnesses and thicker cases, than RF plasma nitriding. Unlike DC plasma nitriding, for the conditions employed no compound layer was formed {{on the surface of the}} samples treated by either PI 3 or RF plasma nitriding. The best case, in terms of hardness and depth, was produced by PI 3 at 350 °C and by DC plasma nitriding at higher temperatures. At all temperatures, RF plasma nitriding produced the shallowest cases with the lowest hardnesses. It has been argued that the mode of plasma generation plays a critical role in nitrogen mass transfer. More specifically, the operating pressure and ion energy have been found to be the key parameters in determining the total nitrogen adsorption on the surface. In DC plasma nitriding mass transfer is primarily controlled by sputtering and re-deposition. The moderate ion energy in DC plasma nitriding causes sputtering of the cathodic surfaces. Sputtered species undergo collision with the nitrogen in the vicinity of the surface because of low mean free path for collision (few millimetres) which is a direct result of the relatively high operating pressure of a DC plasma. In stark contrast, in PI 3 and RF plasma nitriding, the mean free path for collision of the ions and atoms is in the order of several centimetres because of low operating pressure, hence there will be no collisions near the sample and no re-deposition of sputtered material will take place. Owing to extremely high ion energies involved in PI 3, ion implantation is the dominant mass transfer mechanism and sputtering of surface atoms is considerably lower than DC plasma nitriding. The lack of significantly energised ions in RF plasma nitriding eliminates the possibility of implantation and the main mass transfer mechanism is due to the adsorption of low energy neutral species which are incapable of inducing and sputtering...|$|R
