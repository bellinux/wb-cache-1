40|$|What {{authoring}} possibilities arise by <b>blending</b> <b>machine</b> {{and human}} control of live embodied character experiences? This paper explores two different “behind-the-scenes ” roles for human operators during a three-month gallery installation of an embodied character experience. In the Transcription role, human operators type players ’ spoken utterances; then, algorithms interpret the player’s intention, choose from pre-authored dialogue based on {{local and global}} narrative contexts, and procedurally animate two embodied characters. In the Discourse role, human operators select from semantic categories to interpret player intention; algorithms use this “discourse act ” to automate character dialogue and animation. We compare these two methods of blending control using game logs and interviews, and document how the amateur operators initially resisted having to learn the Discourse version, but eventually preferred having the authorial control it afforded. This paper also outlines a design space for <b>blending</b> <b>machine</b> and human control in live character experiences...|$|E

The dielectric properties of the substrates were obtained with the open ended coaxial method for microwave frequency range between 0. 2 MHz and 20 GHz. The results reveal that the permittivity values of the composite can be tuned by changing the ratio of OPEFB/PCL/NiO prior to compounding and blending. These composites may offer alternatives to Teflon, which is made primarily from petroleum, for applications in radio and communications, especially in the fabrication of antennas, transmission and other microwave components...|$|E

40|$|A {{process control}} systems design method whose {{architecture}} incorporates {{the use of}} agents, process agents and subprocess agents to further reduce {{the complexity of the}} system was developed. This is an improvement on an earlier architecture which employed only agents and process agents in its processing. An Algorithmic State Machine (ASM) chart of a complex system with or without a natural divide can be segmented into sub-units and a sub-process agent assigned to each sub-unit. Each of these sub-process agents ensures that systems performance information of each sub-unit is obtained and stored. These information would be used when evaluating system performance or for error tracking. The information also serves for process optimization and maintenance. This improved architecture is therefore one that employes state agents to execute the activities of each of the states in an ASM chart, sub-process agents to take charge of the state agents in one sub-unit and a process agent to co-ordinate the activities of the sub-process agents.

50|$|The Iron Plant Complex has 10 main {{production}} line units (the rest are auxiliary and back up units). Iron ores with large grains from Golgohar are converted by ball mills in the Pelletizing plant. After mixing with Chadermalou's smaller grains and bentonite in <b>blending</b> <b>machines</b> it is changed to pellets (diameter: 6-25 mm) and screened by a two-story roller screen. Pellets solidify in an induration tunnel or furnace at 1280 °C. The Lime Production Plant receives limestone from the Hozmahi mine, {{which is then}} calcinated in two rotary kilns at 780-1050 °C. After screening, calcinated lime {{may be used in}} the Lime Plant, consumed in the Palletizing Plant, Briquet Unit or for industrial water production. At the Direct Reduction plant, pellets are charged in Midrex shaft furnaces after misco-grain screening (less than 5mm). Two reducing gases (derived from cracking natural gas or methane, consisting of Co and H2) are injected into the furnace, combine with oxygen from the pellets resulting in CO2 + H2O. Without oxygen, pellets become sponge irons. After screening, sponge irons are transferred to the Steel Plant. Sponge irons with a diameter less than 5 mm go to the briquet unit to produce briquets (diameter above 25 mm). Then, they are transferred to the Steel Plant with the sponge iron.|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} {{essential}} for robots to maintain wireless connectivity with other systems so that commands, sensor data, and other situational {{information can be}} exchanged. Unfortunately, maintaining sufficient connection quality between these systems can be problematic. Robot mobility, combined with the attenuation and rapid dynamics associated with radio wave propagation, can cause frequent link quality (LQ) issues such as degraded throughput, temporary disconnects, or even link failure. In order to proactively mitigate such problems, robots must possess the capability, at the application layer, to gauge {{the quality of their}} wireless connections. However, many of the existing approaches lack adaptability or the framework necessary to rapidly build and sustain an accurate LQ prediction model. The primary contribution of this dissertation is the introduction of a novel way of <b>blending</b> <b>machine</b> learning with fuzzy logic so that an adaptable, yet intuitive LQ prediction model can be formed.

40|$|The {{dielectric}} {{and magnetic}} behaviour and thermal properties of composites based on nickel–zinc ferrite (NZF) filler {{can be improved}} {{by the addition of}} various types of materials. Amongst others, ferrite–polymer composites have been subjected {{to a wide range of}} research, due to their extensive applications: electromagnetic interference shielding, microwave absorption, electrodes and sensors. Currently, the interest in scientific and technical searches for the potential outcomes of ferrite–polymer materials due to their different uses in applications such as telecommunication applications, microwave devices and electromagnetic interference shielding has been growing stronger. The dielectric and magnetic behaviour and thermal properties for such composite materials depend on size, shape and the amount of filler addition. Nickel–zinc ferrite material was prepared using the conventional solid-state reaction technique. This study highlights the development of microwave-absorbing material from NZF by adding natural fibres, Oil Palm Empty Fruit Bunch (OPEFB) and polycaprolactone (PCL). OPEFB is considered in this study because it is a solid waste product of the oil palm milling process which is widely and cheaply available. The use of OPEFB in this product may save the environment from oil palm solid waste. A Thermal Hake <b>blending</b> <b>machine</b> was used in blending the powder structure of NZF + OPEFB + PCL, which made it homogeneous. These composites were characterized by the use of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The thermal degradation behaviour of the composites was analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermogravimetric (DTG) thermograms. The effective permittivity and effective permeability was obtained over a broad frequency range from 8 to 12 GHz at room temperature. It was observed that the values of effective permittivity and permeability increased as the content of NZF content increased. A rectangular waveguide connected to a microwave vector network analyser (PNA) (HP/Agilent model PNA E 8364 B) was employed in measuring the reflection coefficient S 11 and transmission coefficient S 21 parameters of composites for different percentages of NZF filler. This parameter was then used in calculating the microwave absorbing properties (dB) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A novel GaAs {{monolithic}} membrane-diode (MOMED) {{structure has}} been developed and implemented as a 2. 5 -THz Schottky diode mixer. The mixer <b>blends</b> conventional <b>machined</b> metallic waveguide with micromachined monolithic GaAs circuitry to form, for the first time, a robust, easily fabricated, and assembled room-temperature planar diode receiver at frequencies above 2 THz. Measurements of receiver performance, in air, yield a T receiver of 16 500 -K double sideband (DSB) at 8. 4 -GHz intermediate frequency (IF) using a 150 -K commercial Miteq amplifier. The receiver conversion loss (diplexer through IF amplifier input) measures 16. 9 dB in air, yielding a derived “front-end ” noise temperature below 9000 -K DSB at 2514 GHz. Using a CO 2 -pumped methanol far-infrared laser as a local oscillator at 2522 GHz, injected via a Martin–Puplett diplexer, the required power is 5 mW for optimum pumping and {{can be reduced to}} less than 3 mW with a 15 % increase in receiver noise.

40|$|Abstract. Tool {{nose radius}} is an {{important}} geometrical parameter {{in the design of}} the tool. Due to its direct contact with the workpiece surface it have significant effect not only on the resulting surface quality but also on the tool life. Use of an end mill without nose radius can easily <b>blend</b> during <b>machining</b> due to a lot of stresses acting on the edge of the tool while the large nose radius end mill can increase the strength and rigidity of the tool but can also contribute in increasing the friction between the tool and the workpiece. Therefore careful selection of tool nose radius is important and especially important for Polycrystalline Diamond, PCD insert as this tool material has recently shown great success in terms of tool life, surface roughness and productivity over coated and uncoated carbide tools in high speed end milling of titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and with the use of correct tool geometry it can be further helpful in increasing tool life and surface quality.

5000|$|The album {{grew out}} of rehearsals for the fourth Buzzcocks' album with {{producer}} Martin Rushent. After a troubled 1980 the group had convened at Manchester's Pluto Studios early in 1981 to start work on a new Buzzcocks album. However, the sessions went badly, exacerbated by EMI's refusal to pay an advance for the recordings, which put further strain on the Buzzcocks' already difficult financial situation. Seeing the tensions within the band and sensing that Shelley {{was in need of}} a break, Rushent halted the sessions on 9 February and suggested to Shelley {{that the two of them}} should decamp to Rushent's newly built Genetic Sound studio at his home in Streatley, Berkshire to work on new material. Shelley and Rushent began recording tracks on 13 February 1981, the majority of which dated back to 1973-75, before Shelley had formed the Buzzcocks. Rushent had equipped his new studio with the latest electronic equipment, and in the process of recording Shelley and Rushent grew enormously fond of the sound they had created in the studio, which featured an interesting <b>blend</b> of drum <b>machines,</b> synthesizers and sequencers coupled with guitars. Shelley, weary of the Buzzcocks' financial state, decided to leave the band after Island Records' Andrew Lauder offered him a solo record deal based on the demos. Shelley told the NME in an interview in November 1981, [...] "We came here Genetic Sound in February to record demos but as we started to do them they sounded more and more finished, so we nudged them in that direction and within a few months we'd come up with three finished tracks. Just me and Martin in the studio with all the machines." [...] According to Shelley the album was recorded over [...] "a six or seven month period".|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2004. At Mondi Paper Ltd, Merebank, South of Durban, Paper Machine 2 has {{recently}} been transferred onto a Distributed Control System (DCS). This {{was seen as a}} good opportunity to enhance the control of the pulp feed to the machine. A prime concern in operating a paper machine is to ensure consistent set-point paper properties in the Cross-Direction (CD: ie. across the paper width) and in the Machine-Direction (MD: ie. along the paper length). Sophisticated adjustments are available to ensure an even feed of the stock (consistencies around 2 % m/m wood fibres in water) from the head-box across the receiving width of the paper machine. The properties of prime interest as the pulp is pumped through the head-box distributor onto the receiving belt of the machine are the basis weight (fibre mass per unit area) and moisture content (per unit area). However, the distribution system is highly dependent on the properties of the stock as it arrives at the head-box. Variations in upstream chest levels, the supplied pressure, flow-rate and fibre/water ratio, all cause MD and even CD variations. The problems of maintaining steady conditions at the head-box are well known, and are understood to arise from sub-optimal control in the preceding section involving a <b>blend</b> chest and <b>machine</b> chest, amongst other items, where several pulp streams and dilution water are combined. A number of control loops are involved, but appear to require different tuning for different paper grades. Often individual loops are taken off-line. In this study, an understanding of the controller interactions in the stock preparation section has been developed by detailed dynamic modelling, including all of the existing control loops. The model is built up in a modular fashion using a basic element, having one input (which can collect multiple streams originating elsewhere) and four outputs, linked through a vessel of variable volume. Several basic elements are linked together to form the overall system. All of the necessary properties can be defined so that the model allows the simulation of all features of the network: vessels, pipes, junctions, valves, levels and consistencies. A set of first order differential equations is solved which includes total water balance, species mass balances, derivatives of flow controller action, and derivatives of supervisory controller action. Supervisory controllers for consistency or level cascade onto flow controllers. Flow controllers manipulate valves which give a first-order dynamic response of actual flow. Where valves are manipulated directly by the supervisory level, the flow controller is effectively bypassed. This study involves a constraint problem around the blend chest, resulting in a loss of specification at the paper machine. This was solved by the implementation of a static optimiser. Its objective function penalizes deviations from setpoint of five parameters (ratios, consistency and level) using respective weight factors. Both the model and its optimiser were included in a simulator designed with the graphical user interface (GUI) of Matlab. The simulator has then been used to explore control performance over the operating range, by means of a set of scenarios...|$|R
