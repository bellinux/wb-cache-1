5000|$|Perlstein {{was born}} in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to a Reform Jewish family, the third child of Jerold and Sandra (née Friedman) Perlstein. His father ran <b>Bonded</b> <b>Messenger</b> Service, a {{delivery}} company founded by his grandfather in 1955. Perlstein {{grew up in the}} Bayside and Fox Point neighborhoods of suburban Milwaukee, taking cross country trips with his parents and siblings to national landmarks like Mount Rushmore and Yellowstone National Park. In high school, upon earning his driver's license, Perlstein would head to Renaissance Books in downtown Milwaukee, and spend hours in its basement among stacks of old magazines from the 1960s. He later recounted in an interview: [...] "I ended up getting my own archive on the 1960s culture wars. That's where it started." [...] He also wrote in Rolling Stone: [...] "A sixties obsessive since childhood, I misspent my teenage years prowling a ramshackle five-story used-book warehouse that somehow managed [...] [...] [...] to stay one step ahead of Milwaukee, Wisconsin's building inspectors." [...] Following graduation from Nicolet High School, Perlstein attended the University of Chicago, earning a B.A. in History in 1992. While at the University of Chicago - years Perlstein described as [...] "delightfully noisy and dissident", and a stark contrast to the suburbia of his youth, which [...] "felt like a jail" [...] - he was able to engage with and catch neighborhood jam sessions.|$|E

50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, RNA 5'-triphosphatases (RTPases) are phosphatases that cleave the 5'-terminal γ-β phosphoanhydride <b>bond</b> of nascent <b>messenger</b> RNA molecules, {{enabling the}} addition of a five-prime cap as part of post-transcriptional modifications. RTPases generate 5'-diphosphate-ended mRNA and a phosphate ion from 5'-triphosphate-ended precursor mRNA. mRNA guanylyltransferase then adds a backwards guanosine monophosphate (GMP) group from GTP, generating pyrophosphate, and mRNA (guanine-N7-)-methyltransferase methylates the guanine to form the final 5'-cap structure.|$|R
