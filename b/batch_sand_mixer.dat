40|$|Investigations of {{operating}} parameters of widely used <b>sand</b> <b>mixers</b> reveal a wide variability {{range in the}} values of parameters associated with their power demand. Power efficiency of manufacturing processes has received {{a great deal of}} attention lately, which encourages the research efforts to optimise this aspects of operation of machines and installations as well. In the first place these machines and installations have to work properly as a part of the process line- which applies also to moulding <b>sand</b> <b>mixers.</b> Experiments conducted by the authors suggest that the same goal can be achieved at variable energy input levels. To obtain information about the power demands of <b>sand</b> <b>mixers</b> requires the use of highly specialised equipment, methodology and result processing procedures. This study provides a brief characteristic of measurement equipment and results of measurements taken on a unit AG- 015 (based on a roller mixer) and a laboratory rotor mixer...|$|R

An important part of this diploma thesis is a 3 D model of fundamental parts of <b>sand</b> <b>mixer,</b> as well as its composition. Based on the 3 D model is elaborated strenght analysis of selected parts with finite element method.

25|$|The two batches {{differed}} {{from each other}} because the Eastleigh <b>batch</b> had gravity <b>sanding</b> capability and steam regulators on the right hand side, whilst the Ashford <b>batch</b> had steam <b>sanding</b> and regulators on the left, as was common on most other classes of Southern locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|There {{was not one}} {{bottleneck}} to faster casting production {{but rather}} several. Improvements were made in molding speed, molding sand preparation, sand mixing, core manufacturing processes, and the slow metal melting rate in cupola furnaces. In 1912, the sand slinger was invented by the American company Beardsley & Piper. In 1912, the first <b>sand</b> <b>mixer</b> with individually mounted revolving plows was marketed by the Simpson Company. In 1915, the first experiments started with bentonite clay instead of simple fire clay as the bonding additive to the molding sand. This increased tremendously the green and dry strength of the molds. In 1918, the first fully automated foundry for fabricating hand grenades for the U.S. Army went into production. In the 1930s the first high-frequency coreless electric furnace was installed in the U.S. In 1943, ductile iron was invented by adding magnesium to the widely used grey iron. In 1940, thermal sand reclamation was applied for molding and core sands. In 1952, the [...] "D-process" [...] was developed for making shell molds with fine, pre-coated sand. In 1953, the hotbox core sand {{process in which the}} cores are thermally cured was invented. In 1954, a new core binder—water glass (sodium silicate), hardened with CO2 from ambient air, came into use.|$|R
50|$|Sand from Santa Teresa is made {{of almost}} pure silicon dioxide grains with an average grain size of 0.2 mm {{approximately}} and no visible special features regarding grain shape. But {{in spite of its}} apparent simplicity, many puzzles still remain. For example, after many experiments one <b>batch</b> of <b>sand</b> may stop showing revolving rivers (just as singing sand eventually stops singing), which suggests that the decay is connected to certain properties of the surface of the grains that degrade by continued friction.|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{industrial}} glass furnaces show broad glass melt {{residence time}} distributions in the melting tanks and average residence times may {{be up to}} more than two days for high quality glass products, such as float glass or TV glass, despite the minimum residence times of 8 - 10 hours (or even less than 4 hours for container glass furnaces). Long residence times are associated with large melt tank volume/pull rate ratios and high structural heat losses. The recirculation flows, necessary to supply the batch blanket with sufficient energy for the fusion processes of the batch materials, are often poorly controlled and cause these shown residence time differences. For each elementary process step the most relevant process parameters in terms of desired flow patterns, mixing behavior, temperature, chemistry and required time for completion of the process step are analyzed. From this analysis, it is concluded that the different steps need very different conditions comparing the processes with each other. Therefore glass furnace design modifications should be focused on the development of furnaces with segments, each of them dedicated and optimized for the a certain stage of the melting process: melting-in of <b>batch,</b> <b>sand</b> grain dissolution, removal of gases (bubbles and dissolved gases), re-absorption of residual bubbles and glass melt (chemical and thermal) homogenization. Some developments in fast fining and rapid melting-in of batch will be shown and shortly discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of environmentally toxic acidic waste from mining activities is a world-wide problem. Neutralization of this waste {{can be accomplished}} by physicochemical and/or biological means. In this short-term study, synthetic acid mine drainage was added to sandfilled mesocosms containing silica-dominated (quartz) sand. Glucose was added as a carbon source for microbial iron and/or sulphate reduction. Replicates contained two separate <b>batches</b> of <b>sand</b> obtained from the same quarry site. The investigations used to assess and compare the chemical and biological functioning of the replicates included system hydraulic conductivity measurements, sand chemistry, effluent chemistry and bacterial community fingerprinting. Minor differences in composition of the sand, including the levels of available nutrients and micronutrients, resulted in major differences in measured parameters. Significant differences in effluent chemistry were found in systems containing different <b>batches</b> of <b>sand.</b> It was demonstrated that the characteristics of the sand and the presence of acid mine drainage impacted the bacterial community structure and function. The importance of the physical substrate on the selection of functional microbial communities in systems remediating AMD should not be under-estimated. The physical substrate should be carefully selected and it may be prudent to include small-scale comparative studies in each particular setting prior to full-scale implementation.

40|$|Turbine (rotor) mixers {{are widely}} used in {{foundries}} for bentonite rebonding of synthetic system sands. They form basic equipment in modern sand processing plants. Their major advantage is the short time of the rebond mixing cycle. Until now, no complete theoretical description {{of the process of}} mixing in turbine mixers has been offered. Neither does it seem reasonable to try to adapt the theoretical backgrounds of the mixing process carried out in mixers of other types, for example, rooler mixers [1], to the description of operation of the turbine mixers. Truly one can risk the statement that the individual fundamental operations of mixing in rooler mixers, like kneading, grinding, mixing and thinning, are also performed in turbine mixers. Yet, even if so, in turbine mixers these processes are proceeding at a rate and intensity different than in the roller mixers. The fact should also be recalled that the theoretical backgrounds usually relate to the preparation of sand mixtures from new components, and this considerably restricts the field of application of these descriptions when referred to rebond mixing of the system sand. The fundamentals of the process of the synthetic sand rebonding with bentonite require determination and description of operations, like disaggregation, even distribution of binder and water within the entire volume of the rebonded <b>sand</b> <b>batch,</b> <b>sand</b> grains coating, binder activation and aeration. This study presents the scope of research on the sand rebonding process carried out in turbine mixers. The aim has been to determine the range and specific values of the designing and operating parameters to get optimum properties of the rebonded sand as well as energy input in the process...|$|R
25|$|Quicksand forms {{when water}} {{saturates}} {{an area of}} loose sand and the ordinary sand is agitated. When the water trapped in the <b>batch</b> of <b>sand</b> cannot escape, it creates liquefied soil that can no longer support weight. Quicksand can be formed by standing or (upwards) flowing underground water (as from an underground spring), or by earthquakes. In the case of flowing underground water, {{the force of the}} water flow opposes the force of gravity, causing the granules of sand to be more buoyant. In the case of earthquakes, the shaking force can increase the pressure of shallow groundwater, liquefying sand and silt deposits. In both cases, the liquefied surface loses strength, causing buildings or other objects on that surface to sink or fall over.|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{is usually}} used as {{building}} material {{because it has}} many utilities. The use of aggregate as the material to contruct concrete {{that is used by}} many people makes it difficult to be found. Therefore it needs to find alternative material that is economical. This research uses iron-rust as alternative material to change <b>sand</b> in concrete <b>mixer.</b> This iron-rust can be found in iron industry in Krandegan, Kalisemo Village, Loano Subdistrict, Purworejo regency. This research is aimed to make concrete by using the following comparison volume 1 cement : 2 sand : 3 pebbles and the factor of cement water 0, 5. From this sand comparison, it is made percentage with iron-rust 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 %. The material tested {{is in the form of}} concrete cylinder to every variety with diameter 15 cm and length 30 cm. To test the strong pressure of the concrete cylinder it is used in the age of 28 days. This research shows that the variety with comparison 25 % sand : 75 % iron-rust is the best comparison to reach the highest level of strong pressure, that is 242, 44 kg/cm 2. The iron-rust is used to changed <b>sand</b> in concrete <b>mixer.</b> It needs to conduct further research with the different cement water factor, the more the number of sampel and the more various of iron-rust.

50|$|For {{controlling}} secondary efflorescence, admixtures containing aqueous-based {{calcium stearate}} dispersion (CSD) are often added {{at a later}} stage of the batching process with the mix water. In a typical <b>batching</b> process, <b>sand</b> is first charged into the mixer, then the oil-based primary anti-efflorescence admixture is added with constant mixing to allow the oil to coat the sand. Then coarse aggregates, colorants, and cement are added, followed by water. If CSD is used, it is then introduced usually at this point during or after {{the addition of the}} mix water. CSD is an aqueous dispersion wherein fine solid particles of calcium stearate are suspended in the water uniformly. Commercially available CSD has an average particle size of about 1 to 10 micrometres. The uniform distribution of CSD in the mix may render the resulting concrete masonry unit water repellent, as CSD particles are well distributed in the pores of the unit to interfere with the capillary movement of water.|$|R
40|$|The {{process that}} {{happened}} in decreasing Fe 2 + with a rapid sand filter are mechanical straining, sedimentation, adsorbs and an activities of chemical in the water it self. This research uses 2 stages in testing; they are the batch filter and the column filter. On each of the stages we try using activated sand media. This media is known to able to decrease the Fe 2 +. The water spring is from the 2 nd deep well at the Prambanan water treatment facility. The goal from this research {{is to find the}} criteria design on surface loading and to find out the effectiveness in reducing Fe 2 + that is in the water by using the media of activated sand. From this experiment we found that the maximal filtration speed on activated sand is 12, 85 m/jam.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the potential bio-oil production from the smouldering combustion of faeces mixed with sand, {{through a series of}} experiments. Surrogate faeces, with demonstrated equivalence to human faeces, were used in order to minimize variability in the composition. The yield of bio-oil was studied {{as a function of the}} following experimental parameters: original moisture content of the faeces, airflow rate and sand-to-faeces mass ratio. The amount of bio-oil collected was shown to be dependent on the airflow rate and the relative amount of sand used but independent on the moisture content. The bio-oil obtained was characterized by ultimate analysis, water content and calorific value. Under the experimental conditions studied, up to 70 g of bio-oil per kg of dry faeces (HHV = 27. 6 kJ/g) can be produced. Finally, experiments demonstrated that sand can be reused after each experiment. The effect of the ash accumulation in the sand matrix on smouldering was investigated over five successive tests with the same <b>batch</b> of <b>sand.</b> The implementation of this technology to other type of organic waste would contribute to the development of an integrated waste treatment technology, in combination with bio-oil production...|$|R
40|$|No-bake process {{refers to}} the use of {{chemical}} binders to bond the moulding sand. Sand is moved to the mould fill station in preparation for filling of the mould. A mixer is used to blend the sand with the chemical binder and activator. As the <b>sand</b> exits the <b>mixer,</b> the binder begins the chemical process of hardening. This paper presents the results of decomposition of the moulding sands with modified urea-furfuryl resin (with the low content of furfuryl alcohol below 25 % and different activators: organic and inorganic) on a quartz matrix, under semi-industrial conditions. Investigations of the gases emission in the test foundry plant were executed according to the method extended in the Faculty of Foundry Engineering (AGH University of Science and Technology). Article presents the results of the emitted chosen aromatic hydrocarbons and loss on ignition compared with the different activators used to harden this resin. On the bases of the data, it is possible to determine the content of the emitted dangerous substances from the moulding sand according to the content of loss on ignition...|$|R
30|$|Batch {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} investigate the efficiency of iron and arsenic (III) removal with different dosages of coated sand and limestone {{and the effect of}} initial concentrations of iron and arsenic, respectively, at fixed dosage of coated sand and limestone. Erlenmeyer flasks (250  ml) containing a fixed dosage of coated sand and limestone with 100  ml each of iron or arsenic (III) solution were placed on a mechanical shaker at room temperature (27  °C ±  1) for a fixed time period (2  h). The flask was then removed and the solution was filtered through Whatman No. 41 filter paper. Each batch was repeated three times and the mean value was taken for computation. The effect of limestone addition on the removal efficiency of iron and arsenic (III) was observed by varying the dose of limestone in each <b>batch</b> of coated <b>sand.</b> The same dose of limestone was added to different doses of coated <b>sand</b> in every <b>batch.</b> The effect was also observed without using limestone with different doses of coated sand. The optimized dose of limestone and coated sand was evaluated and used to observe the removal efficiency with varying concentrations of iron and arsenic (III)-spiked water.|$|R
40|$|Sorption of {{hydrophobic}} pollutants such as {{polynuclear aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) to soil and aquifer materials can severely retard their mobility {{and the time}} course of their removal. Because mobile colloids may enhance the mobility of hydrophobic pollutants in porous media and indigenous bacteria are generally colloidal in size, bacterial isolates from soil and subsurface environments were tested for their ability to enhance the transport of phenanthrene, a model PAH, in aquifer <b>sand.</b> <b>Batch</b> isotherm experiments were performed to measure the ability of selected bacteria, including 14 isolates from a manufactured gas plant waste site, to sorb 14 C-phenanthrene and to determine whether the presence of the suspended cells would reduce the distribution coefficient (Kd) for phenanthrene with the sand. Column experiments were then used to test the mobility of isolates that reduced the Kd for phenanthrene and to test the most mobile isolate for its ability to enhance the transport of phenanthrene. All of the isolates tested passively sorbed phenanthrene, and most but not all of the isolates reduced the Kd for phenanthrene. Some, but not all, of those isolates were mobile in column experiments. The most mobile isolate significantly enhanced the transport of phenanthrene in aquifer sand, reducing its retardation coefficient by 25 % at a cell concentration of approximately 5 x 10 (7) ml- 1. The experimental results demonstrated that mobile bacteria may enhance the transport of PAHs in the subsurface...|$|R
40|$|This {{scientific}} {{analysis of}} evidence excavated from glass-making sites, Blunden's Wood (c. 1330 AD), Knightons (c. 1550 AD) and Sidney Wood (1600 - 1620 AD), has provided further {{understanding of the}} technology used to produce `forest' glass in England between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries. The influx of immigrant glass-makers into England during this time, especially during the sixteenth century, had a large impact on the English glass industry. The production of `forest' glass used ash and sand as the raw ingredients in the glass batch. This work demonstrated {{that it was possible}} to determine the correlation between certain components in the glass, and therefore, determine which components entered the <b>batch</b> from the <b>sand,</b> and those that entered from the ash. This work hinted that oak ash was used in preference to beech. In addition to this, it appeared that fritting did take place, from the evidence from Blunden's Wood, at a temperature in the region of 900 °C. This frit was then melted at a temperature that may have been as high as 1300 °C. The changes in glass technology began to take place during the middle of the sixteenth century, and in the first quarter of the seventeenth century the `forest' glass industry ceased. The move to coal-fired furnaces, the higher demand for glass and the improvement in quality of glass all contributed to the expansion and migration of the industry that was seen at the start of the seventeenth century...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} thesis {{has three}} major purposes: (1) {{to explore the}} static liquefaction phenomenon in saturated sand as a relevant geotechnical hazard, (2) to show the conventional testing procedures for index characterisation and strength testing of saturated fine sands at low stress levels, and (3) {{to look into the}} fluidization mechanism and the ongoing research into its applications in saturated sand testing, done at Delft University of Technology. The exploring on static liquefaction was performed by a literature study, which allowed to relate the macroscopic scale of this hazard in underwater slopes with the common practices performed in laboratory conditions. The literature found shows that a change in the framework of understanding saturated sand behaviour, accounting for anisotropy, may occur within the next years. In addition, the literature supports that improvements on the liquefaction prediction can only be done via: improvements of: the theoretical framework in which the sand behaviour is studied, the constitutive and numerical models used for prediction of the liquefaction mechanism and the testing and the physical modelling methods allowing for both sand characterisation and the determination of the constitutive model parameters. Some tests performed to characterise a fine sand were selected to see how the method can affect the obtained results and how the conditions of the sample preparation and control can affect the liquefaction potential on a saturated sand sample. The results support that idea that the amount of fines on the sand, indicated generally by a sieving test, can affect the results of the index minimum and maximum void ratio, differentiating the properties of a sand with fines and a sand without fines. In addition, several variables such as the degree of saturation, confining stress levels and membrane penetration can {{contribute to the development of}} pore pressures and the development of liquefaction. The literature study reveals that fluidization has been used on research on granular soils sedimentation, documented in the work by Allen (1984), and is not as new in earth sciences as it was thought to be. Based on the undrained triaxial testing procedure suggested by Jager and Molenkamp (2015 a), where fluidization will be used for sample preparation, some <b>sand</b> <b>batches</b> were prepared, in which layers were removed to characterise the final product. While the results on void ratio distribution along the depth of the column are not sufficient to draw further conclusions, it was found that the discharge rate can affect the porosity distribution during and after fluidization. The study not only showcases two techniques that can allow a quantitative assessment of fluidization mechanism, but also that inclusion of this method in loose sample preparation could bring improvements into granular soils characterisation.
