On {{one hand}} our stubbornness has paid off, {{but on the}} other hand refusing to buy into the way things are {{traditionally}} supposed to be done has made things worse for us... The realistic part is it hasn't proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> money-making venture for a lot of guys in the band.|$|E

During her childhood, Tisdale was {{featured}} in over one hundred advertisements and had minor roles in television and theatre. She achieved mainstream success as Maddie Fitzpatrick in the Disney Channel series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. This success was heightened when she starred as Sharpay Evans in the High School Musical franchise. The film series proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> success for Disney and earned a large following. The success of the films led to Tisdale signing with Warner Bros. Records, releasing her debut album, Headstrong (2007), through the label. The album was a commercial success, earning a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). She starred as Candace Flynn in the animated series Phineas & Ferb from 2007 to 2015.|$|E

5|$|Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! premiered at Liberty Cinema in {{southern}} Mumbai on 5 August 1994; it eventually ran there for over 100 weeks. The film initially saw {{a very limited}} release, also showing at the Regal and Eros theatres, with only 26 prints total. Eventually it started to appear in many more theatres. When initial viewers complained about the film's length, 2 of the 14 song sequences were removed. These were later restored when film goers were found to enjoy all of the songs. Early reviewers of Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! predicted that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> flop; hence the industry was stunned when it {{went on to become}} the most successful film of all time up to that point.|$|E
5|$|In June2013, Iwata {{took the}} {{additional}} role of Nintendo of America's CEO. As {{one of his}} first changes as CEO, Iwata decided that they would not hold large press conferences at E3, and instead have several smaller events, each aimed at a certain demographic. While traveling to Tokyo in late 2013, Iwata sketched an idea for a series of physical toys that could connect with Nintendo's games. This concept soon developed into the Amiibo line of figures which launched less than a year later. Amiibo proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> success, with more than 6million figurine sold by the end of 2014, roughly a month after launch. By March2016, combined sales of figures and cards—a product released in 2015—exceeded 64million units, proving financially beneficial across all Nintendo platforms.|$|E
5|$|The band {{continued}} to release commercially successful albums, including Some Girls (1978) and Tattoo You (1981), which were their most popular albums worldwide. From 1983 to 1987, tensions between Jagger and Richards almost caused the band to split. However, {{they managed to}} patch up their friendship after they separated temporarily to work on solo projects, and experienced a comeback with Steel Wheels (1989), which {{was followed by a}} large stadium and arena tour. Since the 1990s, new recorded material from the group has been less well-received and less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones have {{continued to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> attraction on the live circuit, with stadium tours in the 1990s and 2000s. By 2007, the band had four of the top five highest-grossing concert tours of all time: Voodoo Lounge Tour (1994–1995), Bridges to Babylon Tour (1997–1998), Licks Tour (2002–2003) and A Bigger Bang Tour (2005–2007).|$|E

5|$|The festival {{turned out}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> success, both {{critically}} and financially. The show {{attracted the attention of}} entertainment executives, including Columbia Pictures, which met with Laliberté and Gauthier under the pretense of wanting to make a movie about Cirque du Soleil. Laliberté was unhappy with the deal, claiming that it gave too many rights to Columbia, which was attempting to secure all rights to the production. Laliberté pulled out of the deal before it could be concluded, and that experience stands out as a key reason why Cirque du Soleil remained independent and privately owned for 28 years, until Guy Laliberte announced in April 2015 that he was selling his majority stake to a group headed by a U.S. private equity firm, and its Chinese partners.|$|E
5|$|Uematsu joined Square in 1985, and {{composed}} the soundtrack to Cruise Chaser Blassty in 1986, his first. While working at Square, he met Hironobu Sakaguchi, who {{asked him if}} he wanted to create music for some of his games, which Uematsu agreed to. For the next year, he created music for a number of games which did not achieve widespread success, including titles like Genesis and Alpha. In 1987, Uematsu and Sakaguchi collaborated on what was originally to be Sakaguchi's last contribution for Square, Final Fantasy, a game that turned out to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> success.|$|E
5|$|Winning the {{contract}} to re-engine the KC-135 tanker fleet for the USAF would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> boon to the CFM56 project (with more than 600 aircraft available to re-engine), and CFMI aggressively pursued that goal {{as soon as the}} Request For Proposals (RFP) was announced in 1977. Like other aspects of the program, international politics played their part in this contract. In efforts to boost the CFM56's chances versus its competitors, the Pratt & Whitney TF33 and an updated Pratt & Whitney JT8D, the French government announced in 1978 that they would upgrade their 11 KC-135s with the CFM56, providing one of the first orders for the engine.|$|E

5|$|Sinclair's team {{crosses the}} wall and goes to Glasgow, Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local {{hospital}} for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed {{by a group of}} marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> gang of brutal cannibals. Sinclair is interrogated by the gang's leader, Sol, who plans to use her as leverage to cross the wall, allowing his army to start their invasion on England; it's the only way to change the UK back to its former glory. He then leaves for the sacrificial ceremony to join the rest of the gang, who grill Dr. Talbot and eat him alive. With the help of Cally, another prisoner, Sinclair escapes and kills Viper, Sol's dedicated partner. After meeting with Norton and Stirling, they escape on a train. Cally reveals that she and Sol are Kane's children. Unsatisfied with Kane's rule, Sol left to create his own army.|$|E
5|$|To ease her heartbreak and the {{rejection}} from her family, Silk turns to alcohol and chain smoking. She gains weight, {{causing her to}} lose her status as a sex symbol. Silk approaches Silva Ganesh with an offer to produce a film together. Ultimately, the audience and industry has lost interest in her, and the film fails. On the other hand, Abraham directs a film which turns out to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> hit, and he feels that he has finally proven to Silk (and himself) that his films do not need any sexualisation to be successful. Having lost her fame and fortune, Silk has accumulated so much debt that she approaches a small-time filmmaker, willing to take on any role. She is shocked to find that he wants her to do a pornographic film, and she refuses. He intoxicates her with alcohol and starts filming, without her permission. The place is raided by the police but Silk manages to escape.|$|E

25|$|The main {{building}} of the college was constructed in three stages between 18851930 and the foundation stone was laid by Cardinal Moran, Archbishop of Sydney, on 15 December 1885. As originally designed by Gilbert, Dennehy and Tappin, of Ballarat, the building was to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> square, representing four identical fronts, but only the South front was completed according to plan due to financial constraints.|$|E

Five years later, on 8 September 1882, his successor, Archbishop Vaughan, presided at the dedication Mass. Archbishop Vaughan gave the peal of bells which were rung {{for the first time on}} that day. Vaughan died while in England in 1883.|$|E
