Hollyer sold the reproductions both via printsellers around the country and directly via catalogue, and the print proved extremely popular.|$|E

He was signed as a replacement for Frenchman M'Baye Niang who had moved on loan to Premier League side Watford. Ocampos made his debut for the club on 5 February, coming on as a late second-half substitute for Andrea Bertolacci in a 1–0 defeat to Sampdoria. He featured sporadically for the club, however, and at the end of the season returned to Marseille having played 29 matches and scored 3 goals across all competitions during his stints with Genoa and Milan.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose that}} {{consumers}} <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> low- (vs. high-) reputation sellers pay {{greater attention to}} surcharges. Thus, reputation moderates the effect of surcharges on purchase. Data from eBay show that consumers adjust bids to account for surcharges when <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> low-reputation sellers but not when <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> high-reputation sellers (study 1). Study 2 replicates this effect with partitioned versus consolidated prices. Study 3 reveals that consumers take longer to make purchasing decisions when <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> low-reputation sellers and that response times mediate the moderating role of reputation. Furthermore, the effect of surcharges levied by low-reputation sellers is attenuated for consumers with low (vs. high) need for cognition (study 4).

5|$|Tensions {{between the}} older {{citizens}} of the Most Holy Redeemer Parish and the gays entering the Castro District were growing, however, and in 1973, when two gay men tried to open an antique shop, the Eureka Valley Merchants Association (EVMA) attempted {{to prevent them from}} receiving a business license. Milk and a few other gay business owners founded the Castro Village Association, with Milk as the president. He often repeated his philosophy that gays should <b>buy</b> <b>from</b> gay businesses. Milk organized the Castro Street Fair in 1974 to attract more customers to the area. More than 5,000 attended, and some of the EVMA members were stunned; they did more business at the Castro Street Fair than on any previous day.|$|E
5|$|Abuses {{of power}} over the villagers by Abir had been {{reported}} by missionaries almost since they began operations in the Congo but the first real public disclosure came in 1901 {{with the publication of}} a report, written by an ex-agent, in several Belgian newspapers. The Free State began an investigation into Abir's abuses during which an inquiry established at Bongandanga heard evidence from missionaries in the concession. As a result, Abir took action against the missionaries, stopping the carriage of their mail on company steamers, stopping the missionaries' boats and confiscating any mail that they carried. Abir also forbid missionaries from buying food from villagers, forcing them to <b>buy</b> <b>from</b> Abir's own stores. In 1904 Roger Casement issued the Casement Report which condemned the Abir system; this resulted in the Free State launching another investigation later that year. Although evidence of unlawful killings made by Abir was uncovered the investigation had no powers of arrest and could only submit a report to the Free State authorities. This lack of action resulted in deteriorating relations between Abir and the missionaries and there was at least one attempted shooting of a missionary. Evidence for Abir's abuses also came from the governor of the French Congo, to the north-west, who claimed that prior to 1903 30,000 people had been driven from the Free State to the French Congo by Abir's actions.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} is to investigate the Romanian online customers’ perception as regards {{to the process of}} <b>buying</b> products <b>from</b> the Internet. The research objectives are: (1) to identify {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> the Internet, (2) to identify the reasons of <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> the Internet, (3) to identify the reasons of frequently <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> the same website. We employed a qualitative research method, based on depth interviews. It is an exploratory and instrumental research. The sample is represented by 30 Romanian online customers who frequently <b>buy</b> products <b>from</b> a specific website. The results show that the most important reasons for online shopping are: space accessibility, access convenience, evaluation convenience, delivery convenience, time saving and money saving. The motivations for repeating the purchase from the same website are: product quality, product diversity, quick delivery, easy to use, recommendations, good deals, safety, reputation and interactivity...|$|R

25|$|Task Review: Renaissance decided upon an Italian theme, but {{spent too}} long with their brand and pricing for the themed {{day that they}} could not <b>buy</b> <b>from</b> the wholesalers, thus forced to <b>buy</b> <b>from</b> {{elsewhere}} and resulting in increased food costs. Although their income was high and their services smoothed out after a shaky start, the team suffered from a lack of supplies that resorted to them cutting prices in half on their pizzas, with their expenditure being much higher due to their high cost overruns. Meanwhile, Alpha chose a Bollywood theme, yet while they managed to arrange all their printing for free, they were forced to cancel their lunch service due to the food not being prepared properly. They soon turned things around by focusing on a sales strategy of selling admission tickets for £5 that were redeemable against dinner, which proved to be a decisive idea as they secured a healthy profit, even before they had served a meal.|$|E

This differs from the Bertrand competition model where it is assumed that firms are willing and able to meet all demand. The limit to output can be considered as a physical capacity constraint which is the same at all prices (as in Edgeworth’s work), or to vary with price under other assumptions.|$|E
