5|$|Augustus' brother, Otto, {{devised the}} scheme to corner United Copper, {{believing that the}} Heinze family already {{controlled}} {{a majority of the}} company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze's shares had been borrowed, and sold short, by speculators <b>betting</b> <b>that</b> the stock price would drop, and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a short squeeze, whereby the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} and most successful practitioners of market manipulation, making his fortune by leveraging both short sales and short sellers. In the former, he would sell stocks to other traders under contract to purchase it at a later date, <b>betting</b> <b>that</b> the market value would go down in the future and he could pocket the difference (trade rules have changed, and short selling is more complicated than this today). In the latter he would execute the opposite maneuver, corner a market by buying up all of the bonds of a particular company or sector, up-ticking the price so as to make a profit at the expense of any short sales based on those stocks. Hardworking, highly ambitious, and with his eyes set on the very top from the very beginning, Little commonly spent twelve hours a day working on such maneuvers in his office and a further six during the evening engaged in currency speculation.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, NAB {{discovered}} {{that as a}} result of unauthorised spot trades on its foreign currency options desk, losses totalling A$360 million had been covered up. Investigations by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority highlighted a need for cultural change. The losses were a result of a failed speculative position where the traders falsified profits to trigger bonuses over a number of years. In order to actually generate the reported profits, the traders speculated on the US dollar, <b>betting</b> <b>that</b> it would rise against the Australian dollar and other currencies.|$|E
500|$|There were {{widespread}} allegations by {{the media}} and English players that the riot was started by bookmakers, or at least encouraged by the widespread <b>betting</b> <b>that</b> was known to be occurring at the match.

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1957, the US National Security Council had {{explored}} including a one-year test moratorium and a [...] "cut-off" [...] of fissionable-material production in a [...] "partial" [...] disarmament plan. The British government, then led by Macmillan, had yet to fully endorse a test ban. Accordingly, it pushed the US to demand that the production cut-off be closely timed with the testing moratorium, <b>betting</b> <b>that</b> the Soviet Union would reject this. London also encouraged the US to delay its disarmament plan, in part by moving {{the start of the}} moratorium back to November 1958. At the same time, Macmillan linked British support for a test ban to a revision of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act), which prohibited sharing of nuclear information with foreign governments. Eisenhower, eager to mend ties with Britain following the Suez Crisis of 1956, was receptive to Macmillan's conditions, but the AEC and the congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy were firmly opposed. In was not until after Sputnik in late 1957 that Eisenhower quickly moved to expand nuclear collaboration with the UK via presidential directives and the establishment of bilateral committees on nuclear matters. In early 1958, Eisenhower publicly stated that amendments to the McMahon Act were a necessary condition of a test ban, framing the policy shift in the context of US commitment to its NATO allies.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded [...] "Earthling" [...] with a B. Unlike Isler, the A.V. Club {{reviewer}} {{loved the}} opening, calling it [...] "one of Fringes most effective freak-meets". Murray continued {{that he believed}} the episode to be [...] "an efficient action/adventure/horror hour, heavy on suspenseful moments and neat effects, light on character development and progress on the master-plot. When {{all is said and}} done and Fringe eventually ends its run, I'm <b>betting</b> <b>that</b> a newcomer will be able to skip 'Earthling' without putting a dent in their overall understanding of the show. But that doesn't mean it wasn't still cool to see people get reduced to dust right in front of our eyes. Jane Boursaw from AOL TV responded negatively to the episode, wishing it had not been yet another [...] "stand-alone creature feature". While praising the special effects, Boursaw expressed disinterest in learning more about Broyles and compared the Fringe case to something already done in The X-Files. She concluded, [...] "Take the creepy alien factor out of it, and this could have been any other police procedural". UGO Networks reviewer Alex Zalben also noted similarities to The X-Files, writing that [...] "the reason [...] is weird for Fringe is that, aforementioned evidence aside, they’ve been very careful to avoid the overarching alien mythology X-Files is famous for.

2500|$|In {{the latter}} half of the twentieth-century Gladstone's {{economic}} policies came to be admired by Thatcherite Conservatives. Margaret Thatcher proclaimed in 1983: [...] "We have a duty to make sure that every penny piece we raise in taxation is spent wisely and well. For it is our party which is dedicated to good housekeeping—indeed, I would not mind <b>betting</b> <b>that</b> if Mr Gladstone were alive today he would apply to join the Conservative Party". In 1996, she said: [...] "The kind of Conservatism which he and I...favoured would be best described as 'liberal', in the old-fashioned sense. And I mean the liberalism of Mr Gladstone, not of the latter-day collectivists". Nigel Lawson, one of Thatcher's Chancellors, believed Gladstone to be the [...] "greatest Chancellor of all time".|$|E

2500|$|Attempts {{were being}} made {{at this time to}} {{regulate}} prize fighting, and a group of gentlemen came together to form the Pelican Club, where fights were held in strict adherence to the [...] "Queensbury Rules." [...] Baird {{became a member of the}} club, but was expelled after becoming involved in a fight scandal. [...] Frank Slavin and Jem Smith fought a match in Bruges. [...] When the fight appeared to be going against Baird's man (Smith), bystanders invaded the ring, and the fight had to be stopped and declared a draw. This coincided with some heavy <b>betting</b> <b>that</b> had been laid on this result, and the committee of the Pelican Club put the blame squarely on Baird's shoulders. [...] He took them to court in an effort to be reinstated, but failed; on 7 March 1890, Mr Justice Stirling, Chancery Court found against him.|$|E
2500|$|Investment banks, {{including}} Goldman, {{have also}} been accused of driving {{up the price of}} gasoline by speculating on the oil futures exchange. In August 2011, [...] "confidential documents" [...] were leaked [...] "detailing the positions" [...] in the oil futures market of several investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, and Barclays, just before the peak in gasoline prices in the summer of 2008. The presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant {{for the fact that the}} banks have deep pockets, and so the means to significantly sway prices, and unlike traditional market participants, neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold. Journalist Kate Sheppard of Mother Jones called it [...] "a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude". However, another source stated that [...] "Just before crude oil hit its record high in mid-2008, 15 of the world's largest banks were <b>betting</b> <b>that</b> prices would fall, according to private trading data...." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the new chapter-based storylines, an artificial intelligence system called [...] "Tactics" [...] was implemented that allowed the player to provide strategies to the party members (who become NPCs in the final chapter), such as prioritizing damage, healing or MP conservation, while maintaining full control of the Hero. , [...] and the remakes of IV allow tactics to be set for characters individually rather than using one tactics mode for all characters, as well as including the [...] "Follow Orders" [...] Tactics mode, which allows other characters to be controlled manually. This [...] "Tactics" [...] system {{is seen as a}} precursor to Final Fantasy XIIs [...] "Gambits" [...] system. The wagon, first introduced in this game, allows the player to choose which characters are used in battle. The wagon can also be seen in Dragon Quest V and Dragon Quest VI. The first casino appears in this installment as a place to play several mini-games (slot machine, poker, and the Monster <b>Betting</b> <b>that</b> was introduced in Dragon Warrior III) using tokens that could be traded for special items. Searching drawers and inside of jars was first introduced in this game as a means to find items.
