5|$|At 1:24a.m., {{one of the}} two men outside {{pushed the}} buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen who heard of a {{disturbance}} in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men. When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax. The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.|$|E

500|$|The {{election}} of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) in 1932 quelled the public affection for dictators. As the country became increasingly enthralled with FDR, who {{was featured in}} countless newsreels, it exhibited less desire for alternative forms of government. Many Hollywood films reflected this new optimism. Heroes for Sale, despite being a tremendously bleak and at times anti-American film, ends {{on a positive note}} as the New Deal appears as a sign of optimism. When Wild Boys of the Road (1933), directed by William Wellman, reaches its conclusion, a dispossessed juvenile delinquent is in court expecting a jail sentence. However the judge lets the boy go free, revealing to him the symbol of the New Deal <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> and tells him [...] "hings are going to be better here now, not only here in New York, but all over the country." [...] A box-office casualty of this hopefulness was Gabriel Over the White House, which entered production during the Hoover era malaise and sought to capitalize on it. By the time the film was released on March 31, 1933, FDR's election had produced a level of hopefulness in America that rendered the film's message obsolete.*Black, pg. 144.|$|E

2500|$|Glazunov {{made his}} {{conducting}} debut in 1888. The following year, he conducted his Second Symphony in Paris at the World Exhibition. He was appointed conductor for the Russian Symphony Concerts in 1896. In March {{of that year}} he conducted the posthumous premiere of Tchaikovsky's student overture The Storm. In 1897, he led the disastrous premiere of Rachmaninoff's Symphony No 1. [...] This catalysed Rachmaninoff's three year depression. [...] The composer's wife later claimed that Glazunov seemed to be drunk at the time. While this assertion cannot be confirmed, it is not implausible for a man who, according to Shostakovich, kept a bottle of alcohol hidden <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> and sipped it through a tube during lessons.|$|E
2500|$|Although it did {{not become}} a {{constitutional}} requirement until 1977, it had been long-standing convention that a Senate casual vacancy be filled by a person from the same political party. However, on 27 February 1975, the Premier of New South Wales, Tom Lewis, controversially appointed Cleaver Bunton, a person with no political affiliations, to replace Murphy in the Senate, beginning the chain of events {{which led to the}} 1975 Australian constitutional crisis. These events in turn laid the groundwork for the 1977 constitutional change that now ensures such an appointment can never be repeated. Soon after his appointment to the bench, Murphy visited Justice Menzies' old chambers in Taylor Square, which would now be his. Staring at the volumes of British law reports on the shelves <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> he said, [...] "I want all of these to go".

He tries to blackmail her with documentation regarding her sexuality; at that time, Maggie was not publicly known to be a lesbian, although some of her colleagues knew, and any public disclosure could possibly have discredited her and tainted her career. When Luthor injures himself and flees the room (due to kryptonite poisoning from his ring), Maggie is tempted with taking the damaging evidence left <b>behind</b> on <b>his</b> <b>desk.</b> She opts to leave the file in Luthor's hands, explaining to Inspector Dan Turpin that she is no longer ashamed of who she is and will not allow anyone to use it against her.|$|R

[...] To this point, there had been almost no noise, few scuffles, and no casualties. [...] He chatted with a guard for a few minutes before sitting <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> which was in view of the door where inmates came to receive their medication. [...] Myles, Smart, and a third inmate named Toms came up to the door, where Myles asked to receive some pills for his migraines. [...] The guard on duty, Officer Cox, turned to retrieve them as another guard opened the door to let a third guard out. [...] As soon as the door opened, Myles rushed through, brandishing a meat cleaver he had acquired from the kitchens. [...] Toms threatened the other guards with a knife, and they allowed themselves to be herded into a nearby lavatory. [...] Myles burst into Deputy Warden Rothe's office and attacked Rothe with the cleaver. [...] Rothe deflected the blow with a plywood letterbox.|$|E

50|$|By {{the final}} years of the series in the 1970s, Warner was getting elderly and looking {{increasingly}} implausible in uniform. He had increasing difficulty moving about, which was helped slightly by a treatment involving bee stings. When it became known that the 1976 series of eight episodes would be the last, some changes saw familiar faces, including long-standing and popular cast member Peter Byrne leave, bringing in some new blood. The final series was shown in 1976 when Warner was 80 and the producers saw the opportunity to make some changes to the format. George Dixon was shown as retired from the police and being re-employed as a civilian as the collator, a temporary appointment which allowed him to train up who would be the next permanent collator. The introductory monologue and winding-up speech continued to be delivered by George Dixon, now out of uniform and <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> collator's <b>desk.</b> There was an increase in action whilst retaining detailed storytelling with Dixon's values at the core.|$|R

60|$|In a {{few minutes}} he laid aside his pen, and, chin on hand, {{considered}} the shop with thoughtful and intelligent eyes.
