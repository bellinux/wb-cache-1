5000|$|Burks' voyeuristic camera {{movement}} in the film was more radical than anything he had done previously, alternating between [...] "tightly framed compositions shot with 50mm fixed lenses and striking camera moves, including <b>backward</b> and forward <b>zooms,</b> elaborate tracking shots pans, crane shots, Dutch tiles, and even the combination zoom and dolly shot." [...] These decisions were not superfluous though; despite their extreme nature, the camera {{movement in}} the film was highly calculated and fluid, ultimately reflecting a [...] "highly effective synthesis of narrative development and artistic expression." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{opening scene}} is a three-minute computer-generated sequence, {{beginning}} {{with a view of}} Earth from high in the exosphere and listening in on numerous radio waves of modern programming emitting from the planet. The camera then starts <b>zooming</b> <b>backward,</b> passing the Moon, Mars, and other features of the solar system, then to the Oort cloud, interstellar space, the Local Bubble, the Milky Way, other galaxies of the Local Group, and eventually into deep space. As this occurs, the radio signals start to drop out and reflect older programming, representing the distance these signals would have traveled at the speed of light, eventually becoming silent as the distance becomes much greater. The sequence eventually resolves into the iris of young Ellie's eye as she is listening on her amateur radio set. This scale view shot of the entire universe was inspired by the short documentary film Powers of Ten (1977). At the time, it was the longest continuous computer-generated effect for a live-action film, eventually surpassed by the opening sequence from The Day After Tomorrow (2004).|$|R

This talk {{will focus on the}} use High Definition TV format in presenting earth science data, The Television (HDTV) networks are mandated to completely switch over from the current TV standard (NTSC) to HDTV in the next seven years. Museums are also beginning to use HDTV format in their displays. The Visualization Analysis Laboratory at Goddard Space Flight Center has been experimenting with the use of HDTV to present earth science data. The experimental package we have developed is called the Electronic Theater (e-theater). The e-theater is a mobile presentation system used for displaying and teaching groups about earth science and the delicate interdependence between the various earth systems. The e-theater takes advantage of a double-wide screen to show the audiences high resolution data displays. The unique architecture used in this exhibit allows several data sets to be displayed at one time, demonstrating the connections between different earth systems. The data animations are manipulated in real-time during the presentation and can be paused, moved forward, <b>backward,</b> looped, or <b>zoomed</b> into, {{to maximize the}} flexibility of the presentation. Because HDTV format is used within the e-theater, the materials generated for the e-theater are made available to the news media and museums...|$|R
