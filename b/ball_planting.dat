50|$|In 1900, Dr. Charles Ripley Gillett and {{his brother}} bought clubs and <b>balls,</b> <b>planted</b> cans in the ground of a cow pasture and {{proceeded}} to teach themselves the game of golf which had recently had been introduced into the United States from Scotland. Soon after, the first Pelham Country Club was formed. This club laid out a nine-hole course on the rolling meadows known as the 'Carson Place'. Dr. Edward P. Fowler of New York City bought the Carson place as a summer home. He lived in the farmhouse, and rented the grounds to the Pelham Country Club for a golf course.|$|R
6000|$|Yes, {{when the}} hour of battle came, he was almost ashamed to say, [...] "Go it, Figs"; {{and not a single}} other boy in the place uttered that cry for the first two or three rounds of this famous combat; at the {{commencement}} of which the scientific Cuff, with a contemptuous smile on his face, and as light and as gay as if he was at a <b>ball,</b> <b>planted</b> his blows upon his adversary, and floored that unlucky champion three times running. At each fall there was a cheer; and everybody was anxious to have the honour of offering the conqueror a knee.|$|R

50|$|The company {{continued}} {{to expand into}} other areas such as avionics, aerospace systems, and metal beverage and food containers. Renamed the Ball Corporation in 1969, it acquired Jeffco Manufacturing Company, a maker of recyclable aluminum beverage cans, and became the largest producer of recyclable beverage cans in the world. Although glass production in Muncie ceased in 1962, it continued at other <b>Ball</b> <b>plants</b> until its final until its final glass manufacturing operations were sold in 1996. Ball Corporation's stock went public on July 13, 1972. It became a publicly-traded stock company on the New York Stock Exchange in 1973. The stock began trading at $26 per share on the NYSE on December 17, 1973, using the trading symbol BLL.|$|R

40|$|The aim of thesis was to {{determine}} the effect of the different plantation biotechnique, different types of packaging and soil type for growing up of Norway spruce and European beech <b>ball</b> and balled <b>planting</b> stock.

The types of planting for different types of planting stock were determined which were subsequently measured various parameters. Based on the measured values, it was found that the planting method is the best and the worst vice versa to the specific soil. Furthermore, the influence of game on planted plants was detected. For afforestation are suitable <b>ball</b> and balled <b>planting</b> stock with type of packaging HIKO V- 120 and HIKO V- 350 for Norway spruce and European beech <b>ball</b> and balled <b>planting</b> stock with type of packaging HIKO V 265...|$|R
25|$|On 14 October 1943, {{a mission}} to Schweinfurt cost the Americans 60 B-17s {{destroyed}} in just over three hours of continuous attacks. The target of these attacks, the <b>ball</b> bearing <b>plants</b> were dispersed before the Americans returned to Schweinfurt. Albert Speer, Hitler's armament minister, said that no weapon failed to reach the front {{due to a lack}} of ball bearings.|$|R
50|$|The {{new engine}} {{provides}} more realistic physics and {{interactions between the}} ball and aspects of the environment, such as accounting for firmness and grass length, and shooting <b>balls</b> through <b>plants</b> and trees.

25|$|In 1943, the {{squadron}} began flying missions to Germany, {{participating in the}} first attack by American heavy bombers on a target in Germany, a raid on the submarine yards at Wilhelmshaven on 27 January 1943. From that time, it concentrated primarily on strategic bombardment of German industry, marshalling yards, and other strategic targets, including the <b>ball</b> bearing <b>plants</b> at Schweinfurt, shipyards at Bremen and an aircraft engine factory at Hamburg.|$|R
50|$|The {{squadron}} operated primarily against strategic targets, {{including the}} locomotive factory at Lille, France, rail yards at Rouen, France and Stuttgart Germany.

50|$|Ball Powder is a fine-grained, spherical {{gunpowder}} {{coated in}} graphite that {{is easy to}} store and transport in any climate and ideal for modern infantry small arms ammunition cartridges.

40|$|Planting trees {{too deeply}} {{has become an}} {{epidemic}} leading to the decline and death of landscape trees. In the landscape, trunk-girdling roots account for more tree deaths than any other factor. Trunk-girdling roots develop when a tree is planted too deeply in the root ball and/or the root <b>ball</b> is <b>planted</b> too deeply in the planting hole. Trunk-girdling roots may lead to decline and death some 12 to 20 years after planting. Trunk-girdling roots may be below ground...|$|R
50|$|The ball {{shape is}} formed from the plant's leaf-pair having fused entirely, {{leaving only a}} tiny slit at the top, where the flower and the {{succeeding}} leaf pair pushes through. The new leaf-pair forms inside the ball. When it is ready, the ball of the old leaf-pair shrivels and dries out, before it is split open by the new leaf-pair <b>ball.</b> The <b>plants</b> are extremely long-lived, and have been kept in captivity for over 50 years.|$|R

His ferocity, when wounded, is terrible, and his {{tenacity}} of life is such that, however many mortal wounds one may give him, he will retain life and strength long enough to kill his assailant before he himself dies, unless he is shot dead at once by a <b>ball</b> being <b>planted</b> in his heart or brain, {{both of which are}} difficult to reach.|$|R
6000|$|... "WEDNESDAY, 18th. This day two provocations happened. First, in {{the morning}} by his Majesty's order, Colonel Borck (the same we saw at Herstal) had gone with a Trumpeter towards Roth; {{intending}} to inform Roth how mild the terms would be, how terrible the penalty of not accepting them. But Roth or Roth's people singularly disregard Borck and his Parley Trumpet; answer its blasts by musketry; fire upon it, nay again fire worse when it advances a step farther; on these terms Borck and Trumpet had to return. Which much angered his Majesty at Ottmachau that evening; as was natural. Same evening, our fine quarters in the Karlau crackled up in flame, the Bishop's winter firewood all along with it: this was provocation second. Roth had taken order with the Karlau; and got a resolute Butcher to do the feat, under pretext of bringing us beef. It is piercing cold; only blackened walls for us now in the Karlau or elsewhere. His Majesty, naturally much angered, orders for the morrow a dose of bomb-shells and red-hot <b>balls.</b> <b>Plant</b> a few mortars on the North side too, orders his Majesty.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1943 longer range raids began, and {{resulted}} immediately in heavy losses.

For {{what was to become}} a famous mission called [...] "Black Thursday", the 326th led the group in the lead wing with 21 aircraft; one 326th Squadron and two other Group aircraft aborted, and of the 12 group aircraft that made it back to England, only 3 came home that day.|$|R

50|$|The land {{on which}} the {{airfield}} stands was originally the Wiesbaden track for horse races built in 1910. In 1929 it was converted into an airfield and in 1936 the German Luftwaffe took over the base. One unit stationed there was Jagdgruppe 50, a fighter group of Messerschmitt Bf 109s. On 17 August 1943 the unit intercepted American bombers {{taking part in the}} ill-fated Regensburg Strike targeting the Messerschmitt factory in Regensburg and the <b>ball</b> bearing <b>plants</b> in Schweinfurt. Alfred Grislawski, a German Luftwaffe fighter ace, took part in that mission.|$|R
50|$|In 1951, {{during the}} Korean War, Olin Industries {{was awarded the}} {{contract}} to manage Badger; the company continued to operate Badger until 2004. To get the plant into operational shape, Olin replaced machinery, office furniture and supplies, and added building production areas and capabilities such as the <b>Ball</b> Powder <b>plant.</b> At that time, Olin Industries was the only manufacturer of Ball Powder in the United States. Ball Powder, which was a trademarked name, had been introduced by Western Cartridge, a subsidiary of Olin Corporation, in 1933, but was not accepted by the U.S. Army until 1944.|$|R
50|$|On 31 July 1943 {{the unit}} was {{declared}} operational, {{with a total}} of 19 aircraft.

Grislawski claimed two Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses downed on this raid. On 6 September the unit's pilots shot down four Flying Fortresses over Stuttgart, one to Grislawski, and two claimed by Graf with the WfGr.21, who was then shot down but survived a forced landing. Grislawski claimed one other kill with the unit, a B-17 on 14 October.|$|R
