25|$|There {{are thus}} two main classes of {{metamorphic}} komatiite; carbonated and hydrated. Carbonated komatiites and peridotites form {{a series of}} rocks dominated by the minerals chlorite, talc, magnesite or dolomite and tremolite. Hydrated metamorphic rock assemblages are dominated by the minerals chlorite, serpentine-antigorite, <b>brucite.</b> Traces of talc, tremolite and dolomite may be present, as it is very rare that no carbon dioxide is present in metamorphic fluids. At higher metamorphic grades, anthophyllite, enstatite, olivine and diopside dominate as the rock mass dehydrates.|$|E
500|$|The {{potential}} of X-ray crystallography {{for determining the}} structure of molecules and minerals—then only known vaguely from chemical and hydrodynamic experiments—was realized immediately. The earliest structures were simple inorganic crystals and minerals, but even these revealed fundamental laws of physics and chemistry. The first atomic-resolution structure to be [...] "solved" [...] (i.e., determined) in 1914 was that of table salt. The distribution of electrons in the table-salt structure showed that crystals are not necessarily composed of covalently bonded molecules, and proved the existence of ionic compounds. The structure of diamond was solved in the same year, proving the tetrahedral arrangement of its chemical bonds and showing that the length of C–C single bond was 1.52 angstroms. Other early structures included copper, calcium fluoride (CaF2, also known as fluorite), calcite (CaCO3) and pyrite (FeS2) in 1914; spinel (MgAl2O4) in 1915; the rutile and anatase forms of titanium dioxide (TiO2) in 1916; pyrochroite Mn(OH)2 and, by extension, <b>brucite</b> Mg(OH)2 in 1919;. Also in 1919 sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and caesium dichloroiodide (CsICl2) were determined by Ralph Walter Graystone Wyckoff, and the wurtzite (hexagonal ZnS) structure became known in 1920.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brucite</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1824 and {{named for the}} discoverer, American mineralogist, Archibald Bruce (1777-1818). A fibrous variety of <b>brucite</b> is called nemalite. It occurs in fibers or laths, usually elongated along 1010, but sometimes 1120 crystalline directions.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of barbertonite has brucite-like layers alternating with inter layers. Neighboring <b>brucite</b> layers are stacked {{so that the}} hydroxyl groups are directly above one another (Taylor et al., 1973). In between <b>brucite</b> layers are inter layers containing CO ions and H2O molecules (Taylor et al., 1973). Oxygen atoms are accommodated in a single set of sites distributed close to the axes that pass through the hydroxyl ions of adjacent <b>brucite</b> layers (Taylor et al., 1973).|$|E
50|$|A notable {{location}} in the U.S. is Wood's Chrome Mine, Cedar Hill Quarry, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

50|$|<b>Brucite,</b> {{the mineral}} form of Mg(OH)2 {{commonly}} found in nature also occurs in the 1:2:1 clay minerals amongst others, in chlorite, in which it occupies the interlayer position normally filled by monovalent and divalent cations such as Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+. As a consequence, chlorite interlayers are cemented by <b>brucite</b> and cannot swell nor shrink.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Brucite</b> is {{the mineral}} form of {{magnesium}} hydroxide, with the chemical formula Mg(OH)2. It {{is a common}} alteration product of periclase in marble; a low-temperature hydrothermal vein mineral in metamorphosed limestones and chlorite schists; and formed during serpentinization of dunites. <b>Brucite</b> is often found in association with serpentine, calcite, aragonite, dolomite, magnesite, hydromagnesite, artinite, talc and chrysotile.|$|E

50|$|<b>Brucite</b> {{may also}} {{crystallise}} in cement and concrete {{in contact with}} seawater. Indeed, the Mg2+ cation {{is the second most}} abundant cation in seawater, just behind Na+ and before Ca2+. Because <b>brucite</b> is a swelling mineral, it causes a local volumetric expansion responsible for tensile stress in concrete. This leads to the formation of cracks and fissures in concrete, accelerating its degradation in seawater.|$|E
50|$|Gibbsite's {{structure}} {{is closely related}} to the structure of <b>brucite,</b> Mg(OH)2. However the lower charge in brucite's magnesium (+2) as opposed to gibbsite's aluminium (+3) does not require that one third of the octahedrons be vacant of a central ion in order to maintain a neutral sheet. The different symmetry of gibbsite and <b>brucite</b> is due to the different way that the layers are stacked.|$|E

50|$|<b>Brucite,</b> {{in which}} some of the Mg2+ cations have been {{substituted}} by Al3+ cations, becomes positively charged and constitutes the main basis of layered double hydroxide (LDH). LDH minerals as hydrotalcite are powerful anion sorbents but are relatively rare in nature.|$|E
