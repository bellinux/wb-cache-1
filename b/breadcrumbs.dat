5|$|In various recipes, other substitutions and {{additions}} are suggested. The Hairy Bikers (Dave Myers and Si King) suggest Welsh cheddar as {{an alternative}} to Caerphilly and propose that it should be served with a red onion and chilli pepper relish. An Australian recipe suggests Lancashire cheese {{as an alternative}} ingredient. Regarding the <b>breadcrumbs,</b> chef Bobby Freeman suggests using half brown and half white <b>breadcrumbs,</b> while the cookbook for the London-based restaurant Canteen proposes using a combination of boiled potatoes and <b>breadcrumbs</b> for the coating of the sausage.|$|E
5|$|The Glamorgan sausage is a Welsh {{vegetarian}} sausage. It {{contains no}} meat or skin, instead {{it is made}} with cheese, generally Caerphilly, but sometimes cheddar, along with leek or spring onion. This mixture is then coated in <b>breadcrumbs</b> and rolled into a sausage shape before cooking. Glamorgan sausages date back to at least the early 19th century, {{at which point the}} sausages would have contained pork fat.|$|E
5|$|Fried {{butter is}} a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century. The first known recipe for fried butter dates to 1615. Fried butter was {{documented}} in the cookbook The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy in 1747. The recipe entailed soaking butter in salted water for a few hours, placing it on a rotisserie ("spit it"), covering it with <b>breadcrumbs</b> and nutmeg, and roasting it under a low fire while continuously covering it with egg yolks and additional bread crumbs. Oysters were recommended to accompany the dish.|$|E

5|$|Glamorgan sausage (Welsh: Selsig Morgannwg) is a {{traditional}} Welsh vegetarian sausage for which the main ingredients are cheese (usually Caerphilly), leeks and <b>breadcrumbs.</b> The earliest published mention of the dish is from the 1850s in the book Wild Wales by George Borrow, although earlier records in the Glamorgan Archives show a version which contains pork. The modern vegetarian version became popular during the Second World War when meat was harder to come by, and is now mass-produced by at least two companies. Variations include swapping the leeks for onions, as well as different herbs and spices, and various types of cheese.|$|E
5|$|In modern versions, Caerphilly {{cheese is}} used, {{which is a}} {{descendant}} of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese recipe and lends the same general texture and flavour. The basic recipe calls for a mixture of cheese, leeks and <b>breadcrumbs,</b> although some recipes swap the leeks for onions or spring onions and may add herbs such as parsley or further flavourings such as mustard. The mixture is then rolled into sausage shapes, and then fried. There is no sausage casing used, although egg is used to bind the mixture {{so that it does}} not fall apart during the cooking process.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The <b>breadcrumb</b> {{scheme was}} {{proposed}} to realize content distribution in next-generation networks. In the bread-crumb (BC) scheme, each node maintains a small piece, called a “breadcrumb, ” of query induction information. The BC scheme can, however, {{increase the amount}} of traffic as well as file acquisition delay since a query for a file is may diverted away from the nearest server with the file even if the query passes close to the server. This paper proposes a hop-aware <b>breadcrumb</b> scheme, in which the query induction information includes latest file acquisition node ID, which enables a query to be diverted toward a closer node, the latest file acquisition node, or the server. Simulations show that the hop-aware <b>breadcrumb</b> scheme yields shorter file acquisition time than the <b>breadcrumb</b> scheme.

25|$|Holishkes, stuffed cabbage, {{also known}} as the cabbage roll, is also a European Jewish dish that emerged from more impoverished times for Jews. Because having a live cow was more {{valuable}} than to eat meat in the Middle Ages, Jews used fillers such as <b>breadcrumbs</b> and vegetables to mix with ground beef. This gave the effect of more meat that was stuffed into the cabbage leaves.|$|E

25|$|Meat can {{be cooked}} in boiling oil, {{typically}} by shallow frying, although deep frying may be used, often for meat enrobed with <b>breadcrumbs</b> as in milanesas. Larger pieces such as steaks may be cooked this way, or meat may be cut smaller as in stir frying, typically an Asian way of cooking: cooking oil with flavorings such as garlic, ginger and onions {{is put in}} a very hot wok. Then small pieces of meat are added, followed by ingredients which cook more quickly, such as mixed vegetables. The dish is ready when the ingredients are 'just cooked'.|$|E

25|$|Vienna is {{well known}} for Wiener Schnitzel, a cutlet of veal (Kalbsschnitzel) or pork (Schweinsschnitzel) that is pounded flat, coated in flour, egg and <b>breadcrumbs,</b> and fried in {{clarified}} butter. It is available in almost every restaurant that serves Viennese cuisine and can be eaten hot or cold. The traditional 'Wiener Schnitzel' though is a cutlet of veal. Other examples of Viennese cuisine include Tafelspitz (very lean boiled beef), which is traditionally served with Geröstete Erdäpfel (boiled potatoes mashed with a fork and subsequently fried) and horseradish sauce, Apfelkren (a mixture of horseradish, cream and apple) and Schnittlauchsauce (a chives sauce made with mayonnaise and stale bread).|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequently}} used meat is pork, followed by beef, lamb, chicken, rabbit, duck and goose; for immediate consumption it is often grilled, or dusted with <b>breadcrumbs</b> and sauteed, in a dish similar to schnitzel. For bigger gatherings, oven roasts are prepared. The need for meat preservation no longer presents the urgency that it did during the Soviet occupation or previous times of trouble, but many favorite techniques survive, include brining, salting, drying and smoking. There are many varieties of smoked pork, including ham and a soft sausage with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or thinly sliced in sandwiches.|$|E

25|$|The {{publication}} of the historical dictionary of the Spanish language allows us to document both, alajur very broadly written as alajú and alfajor. Alajur and multiple geographic variations are sweets made of a paste of almonds, nuts, <b>breadcrumbs</b> and honey. It is effectively possible that alfajor and alajú were Arabisms introduced into the Spanish language in different places and times, and, supposing both {{came from the same}} etymon, from the phonetic point of view, alajú is an Arabism of the Castillian, and so it is still alive in Cuenca, Toledo, Guadalajara and in la Sierra de la peña de Francia; meanwhile the variation alfajor is Andalusian and Murcian. In the Americas, {{the meaning of the word}} alfajor was not known until the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Bazin is {{a common}} Libyan food made with wheat flour and a little plain flour, which is boiled in salted water to make a hard dough, and then formed into a rounded, smooth dome placed {{in the middle of}} the dish. The sauce around the dough is made by frying chopped onions with lamb meat, turmeric, salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, fenugreek, sweet paprika, and tomato paste. Potatoes can also be added. Finally, eggs are boiled and {{arranged}} around the dome. The dish is then served with lemon and fresh or pickled chili peppers, known as amsyar. Batata mubattana (filled potato) is another popular dish that consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and <b>breadcrumbs.</b>|$|E
25|$|Outside Japan (as well as {{recently}} in Japan), {{there are many}} nontraditional and fusion uses of tempura. Chefs over the world include tempura dishes on their menus, and {{a wide variety of}} different batters and ingredients are used, including the nontraditional broccoli, zucchini, asparagus and chuchu. More unusual ingredients may include nori slices, dry fruit such as banana, and ice cream (tempura-based fried ice cream). American restaurants are known to serve tempura in the form of various meats, particularly chicken, and cheeses, usually mozzarella. A variation is to use panko (<b>breadcrumbs),</b> which results in a crisper consistency than tempura batter. Using panko in Japan would no longer qualify the dish as tempura. It would become something else called fry or pronounced in Japanese as furai. Tempura (particularly shrimp) is often used as a filling in makizushi. A more recent variation of tempura sushi has entire pieces of sushi being dipped in batter and tempura-fried.|$|E
