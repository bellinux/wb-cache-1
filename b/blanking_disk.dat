When the unit was first turned on, a green light next to the upper drive flashed, {{indicating}} the user should insert the [...] "master disk" [...] (the disk the user wants to copy). While the Quick Copy read the master disk into memory, the user could place a <b>blank</b> <b>disk</b> into the lower drive, and the unit would automatically begin making the first copy. When the unit was finished reading the master disk, the green light would go on, indicating the master disk was read into memory OK (or, a red light next to the upper drive would indicate a problem reading the master). The master disk could then be removed, and the user could insert a <b>blank</b> <b>disk.</b> As each copy was finished, in either the upper or lower drive, the unit indicated a good copy with a green light or a defective copy with a red light. The user could simply continue removing all the good copies and inserting new <b>blank</b> <b>disks</b> in each drive to make as many copies as desired.

The evaluation of the OXA- 48 disk test was performed with 81 genotypically confirmed OXA- 48 -type-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates (41 extended-spectrum β-lactamase [ESBL] producers, 3 AmpC producers, and 37 non-ESBL, non-AmpC producers). To measure the specificity of the test, 173 genotypically confirmed OXA- 48 -negative Enterobacteriaceae isolates (57 Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase [KPC] producers, 34 VIM producers, 23 KPC/VIM producers, 22 NDM producers, and 37 AmpC or ESBL producers and porin deficient) that were nonsusceptible to at least one carbapenem were chosen for testing. Using the imipenem disk and the distortion of the inhibition halo around both <b>blank</b> <b>disks</b> containing EDTA and EDTA/PBA, the test differentiated all but 3 of the 81 OXA- 48 producers (sensitivity of 96. 3 %).

This evaluation shows that the OXA- 48 disk test is an accurate phenotypic method for the direct differentiation of OXA- 48 -producing Enterobacteriaceae.

Materials and Methods: Different concentrations of PPI-G 2 and PAMAM-G 4 dendrimers were inoculated onto <b>Blank</b> <b>disks</b> and were placed in Mueller-Hinton agar media. Zone of inhibition was investigated by bacterial inoculation according to the McFarland standard 0. 5. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of PPI-G 2 and PAMAM-G 4 dendrimers were determined by Micro-dilution method in nutrient broth culture. Results: Zone of inhibition in concentration 500 μg/ml of PPI-G 2 dendrimers for Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 25, 15 and 20 mm, respectively. Zone of inhibition in concentration 500 μg/ml of PAMAM-G 4 dendrimers for Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 20, 18 and 0 mm, respectively. The MIC of PPI-G 2 dendrimer for Klebsiella oxytoca and for Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 5 μg/ml. Also, the MIC of PPI-G 2 dendrimer for Proteus mirabilis was 50 μg/ml. The MBC of PPI-G 2 dendrimer for Klebsiella oxytoca was 50 μg/ml and it was 500 μg/ml for Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The MIC of PAMAM-G 4 dendrimer attributed to Klebsiella oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis were reported 500 and 1250 μg/ml, respectively. The MBC of PAMAM-G 4 dendrimer belonged to Klebsiella oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis were 1250 and 2500 μg/ml, respectively. Conclusion: According to the results, PPI-G 2 dendrimers can eliminate Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis effectively but PAMAM-G 4 only has antibacterial effect against Klebsiella oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis. Also the antibacterial activity of PPI-G 2 dendrimer is obviously better than those of PAMAM-G 4.
