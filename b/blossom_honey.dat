The antimicrobial action of six Scottish honeys and Manuka Medihoney® was compared against antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli.

40|$|The aim of {{bachelor}} thesis was {{to compare}} production and quality of honey and organic honey from South Bohemia region. Sensory and chemical analysis of selected organic honeydew honey and conventional <b>blossom</b> <b>honey</b> was done. Chemical analysis assessed these traits water content, sucrose content, hydroxymethylfurfural content and electric conductivity. Obtained analyse's results were compared with legislative requirements for honey quality by Czech Ministry of Agriculture Notice no. 73 / 2003 Sb. and Czech beekeepers association's standard no. 1 / 1999 Czech honey. Only organic honey (sample no. 2) did not received Czech honey quality certificate. Measured water content was 19. 5 %. Czech honey standard allows water content only up to 18 %. Higher water content was caused by beekeeper by premature honey removal. Honey was not properly matured. Other analysed traits met both quality standards. Lower honey production was found in case of organic beekeeping. Using <b>blossom</b> <b>honey</b> as a winter season reserve is a common practise in organic beekeeping, which reduces {{the total amount of}} produced (obtained) honey.

40|$|Tese de dout., Química, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Univ. do Algarve, 2012 Erasmus Mundus 2008 - 1022 / 002 Several {{studies were}} {{conducted}} with different Portuguese honey samples from South area (Algarve) in view of exploiting its properties and increasing the commercial value of some types of honey. Initially, the effects of honey storage for long periods were evaluated in terms of physicochemical parameters and bioactivity (Chapter 3) and {{it was concluded that}} after three years most of the properties of honey remained unchanged except for the freshness indicators, which were, as expected, reasonably far from the regulated values. Several commercial samples of honey with different floral origins were subjected to the conventional studies, including melissopalynology pollen analysis, physiochemical and biological (antioxidant properties) analysis. Honey from strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.), a typical plant in Algarve, was the focus of this study. This kind of honey has low acceptability by consumers probably because of unawareness of its existence and/or of its beneficial biological properties. Also, it may not be an obvious preference, due to its exquisite bitter taste, thus being locally called “bitter honey” (Chapter 4). Artisanal bitter honey was compared with other commercial honeys that are appreciated by Portuguese consumers (Chapter 5). This research consisted {{in the study of the}} physicochemical parameters, bioactive compounds and sensorial evaluation; done in comparison with sunflower (Helianthus annuus) honey, french lavender (Lavandula stoechas) <b>honey,</b> orange <b>blossom</b> (Citrus spp.) <b>honey</b> and commercial strawberry tree honey. Finally, in the last stage of the work (Chapter 6), new methods for determination of botanical origin of honey were explored as potential alternatives to the traditional analysis method (melissopalynological). These non-invasive techniques namely electronic tongue, UV-Vis spectroscopy and Vis-NIR spectroscopy, were used with the help of multivariate analysis (principal component analysis, PCA), for the interpretation of data’s obtained with above techniques. It is hoped that this research will represent an enrichment of knowledge on honey from the Algarve and, especially for Arbutus unedo honey, it has been demonstrated that it has the characteristics of similar gourmet honey from Italy existing, therefore, the potential of increasing its commercial value, which would also be advantageous for the interior region of the Algarve where, since the Arab occupation, the strawberry tree is abundant...|$|R

Desta forma, levantou-se o investimento necessário para a produção de mel, em uma propriedade familiar de Cajuru (SP), com estimativas de investimento e custos de produção baseados no Custo Operacional Total (COT) utilizado pelo Instituto de Economia Agrícola, obtendo-se R$ 97. 093, 00 como valor total do investimento. Para a análise econômica, avaliando-se a produção de mel originária de flor de laranjeira e silvestre, o custo operacional total foi de R$ 16. 400, 13, considerando-se que as despesas com insumos perfizeram 70 % do Custo Operacional Efetivo (COE) e 26 % do COT, obtendo-se índice de lucratividade de 46 %. Em relação ao ponto de nivelamento, o apicultor precisa produzir 4. 659 kg de mel, ou vender ao preço mínimo de R$ 1, 93 /kg a produção obtida, para cobrir os custos. Constatou-se, com base no fluxo de caixa, TIR de 7, 24 % e que o investimento inicial retorna em 10 anos, mostrando resultados atrativos para este segmento agropecuário, considerando-se a racionalidade de uso dos fatores de produção, bem como um aumento progressivo na quantidade produzida.
