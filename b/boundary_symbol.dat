The {{two-phase}} free boundary {{problem with}} surface tension and downforce gravity for the Navier-Stokes system is considered {{in a situation}} where the initial interface is close to equilibrium. The <b>boundary</b> <b>symbol</b> of this problem admits zeros in the unstable halfplane in case the heavy fluid is on top of the light one, which leads to the well-known Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Instability is proved rigorously in an Lp-setting by means of an abstract instability result due to Henry [12]. 1...|$|E
40|$|Boutet de Monvel's {{calculus}} {{provides a}} pseudodifferential framework which encompasses the classical differential boundary value problems. In {{an extension of}} the concept of Lopatinski and Shapiro, it associates to each operator two symbols: a pseudodifferential principal symbol, which is a bundle homomorphism, and an operator-valued <b>boundary</b> <b>symbol.</b> Ellipticity requires the invertibility of both. If the underlying manifold is compact, elliptic elements define Fredholm operators. Boutet de Monvel showed how then the index can be computed in topological terms. The crucial observation is that elliptic operators can be mapped to compactly supported $K$-theory classes on the cotangent bundle over the interior of the manifold. The Atiyah-Singer topological index map, applied to this class, then furnishes the index of the operator. Based on this result, Fedosov, Rempel-Schulze and Grubb have given index formulas in terms of the symbols. In this paper we survey previous work how C*-algebra K-theory can be used to give a proof of Boutet de Monvel's index theorem for boundary value problems, and how the same techniques yield an index theorem for families of Boutet de Monvel operators. The key ingredient of our approach is a precise description of the K-theory of the kernel and of the image of the <b>boundary</b> <b>symbol.</b> Comment: 17 pages, submitted to the "Rosenberg proceedings...|$|E

40|$|In {{multilingual}} countries text-to-speech synthesis systems {{often have}} to deal with sentences containing inclusions of multiple other languages in form of phrases, words or even parts of words. Such sentences can only be correctly processed using a system that incorporates a mixed-lingual morphological and syntactic analyzer. A prerequisite for such an analyzer is the correct identification of word and sentence boundaries. Traditional text analysis applies to both problems simple heuristic methods within a text preprocessing step. These methods, however, are not reliable enough for analyzing mixed-lingual sentences. This paper presents a new approach towards word and sentence boundary identification for mixed-lingual sentences that bases upon parsing of character streams. Additionally this approach can also be used for word identification in languages without a designated word <b>boundary</b> <b>symbol</b> like Chinese or Japanese.

They {{consist of a}} single impulse and allow us to model the channel as a simple gain and phase adjustment of the transmitted signal. We begin our analysis by considering the original goal of our approach, {{which is to ensure}} packet synchronization can be performed. It is necessary to examine this performance before we can investigate the bit error rate (BER). Without packet detection, the communications system will fail. For our system to declare successful synchronization the receiver must correctly detect the presence of the packet, as well as accurately determine the <b>symbol</b> <b>boundary.</b> The <b>symbol</b> <b>boundary</b> is used to determine when the packet started and when each symbol begins and ends. Without this information, the receiver is unable to estimate the channel since it does not know when the training data begins and ends. The estimated channel is used by the receiver to estimate the transmitted signal in the secondary filter.|$|R

However, the two-level rule notation {{can be given}} a precise declarative semantics {{in terms of the}} segmentation of sequences of pairs of symbols, quite inde-pendently of any computational representation as sets of finite-state transducers. Thus defined, the two-level model can be shown to be less powerful, in terms of weak generative capacity, than parallel intersections of arbitrary finite-state transducers without empty transitions (the usual computational representation).

Background Koskenniemi (1983 a, 1983 b, 1984) proposed a rule-system for describing morphological regularities in a language, depending centrally on the idea of matching two sequences of symbols [...] a lexical string (made up of the lexical forms of morphemes) and a surface string (the sequence of characters in the normal, inflected, form of the word) ...|$|E
40|$|Parsing can be {{improved}} in automatic speec understanding if prosodic boundary marking is taken into account, because syntactic boundaries are often marked by prosodic means. Because large databases are needed for the training of statistical models for prosodic boundaries, we developed a labeling scheme for syntactic-prosodic boundaries within the German Verbmobil project (automatic speech-to-speech translation). We compare the results of classifiers (multi-layer perceptrons and language models) trained on these syntactic-prosodic boundary labels with classifiers trained on perceptual-prosodic and purely syntactic labels. Recognition rates of up to 96 % were achieved. The turns {{that we need to}} parse consist of 20 words on the average and frequently contain sequences of partial sentence equivalents due to restarts, ellipsis, etc. For this material, the boundary scores computed by our classifiers can successfully be integrated into the syntactic parsing of word graphs; currently, they improve the parse time by 92 % and reduce the number of parse trees by 96 %. This is achieved by introducing a special Prosodic Syntactic Clause <b>Boundary</b> <b>symbol</b> (PSCB) into our grammar and guiding the search for the best word chain with the prosodic boundary scores.

Section 3, demographic questions, asks the online subjects (all {{of the subjects}} are volunteers) to provide their identity information on gender, age, level of education, and email address (optional). Section 4, screening questions, consists of four simple questions on the Chinese language {{which can be used}} to test if a subject is a Chinese speaker or not; the first two questions are open-ended Chinese character identification questions. Each question shows a picture containing a simple Chinese character and asks the subject to identify and type it in a text box below it. The third question is a close-ended homophonic character identification question. It shows the subject a character and asks him/her to identify its homophonic character in 10 different characters. The fourth one is a close-ended antonymous character identification question asking the subject to identify the antonymous character of the given one from 10 different characters.
