25|$|Biocompatibility {{is related}} to the {{behavior}} of <b>biomaterials</b> in various environments under various chemical and physical conditions.

The ambiguity of the term reflects the ongoing development of insights into how <b>biomaterials</b> interact with the human body and eventually how those interactions determine the clinical success of a medical device (such as pacemaker or hip replacement).
