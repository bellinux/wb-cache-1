5|$|Mining {{has been}} done in the Solomon Creek {{watershed}} in the past, causing considerable environmental damage. The mining began {{in the beginning of the}} 1800s and continued until the 1970s. However, there was one strip mining permit in the watershed in the late 1990s. Starting in 1967, the mine pools under the creek stopped having water pumped out of them. This led to them flooding and damaging buildings in the watershed in 1972 during Hurricane Agnes. To remedy the problem of the flooding, the Buttonwood Tunnel and three <b>boreholes</b> known as the South Wilkes-Barre <b>Boreholes</b> were created. The water quality of the creek was assessed in 1970 as part of Operation Scarlift. A 1977 study by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission observed brook trout inhabiting the watershed, although the stream was listed as impaired on account of the mining. A plan called the Solomon Creek Cold Water Conservation Plan was initiated in the summer of 2011 and continued into 2012.|$|E
5|$|Mountains such as Little Wilkes-Barre Mountain and Penobscot Mountain are {{partially}} in the watershed. The {{topography of}} the watershed features refuse piles, crop falls, and strip pits in numerous places due to past mining. Some {{parts of the}} creek are known to run dry at times. Some water from the watershed flows to the South Wilkes-Barre <b>Boreholes,</b> outside of the Nanticoke Creek watershed.|$|E

40|$|Fluid {{pressure}} {{inside a}} <b>borehole</b> produces hydraulic fracture and damage zones {{in the vicinity}} of the <b>borehole.</b> These fractures result from stress concentrations around the <b>borehole.</b> The results of numerical simulation of a <b>borehole</b> subjected to fluid pressure using a micromechanical damage model [2] are presented in this paper.

5|$|The first {{reaction}} of the host tree is traced to the adult wasp and occurs after 10 to 14 days. A phytotoxic secretion of the wasp impairs metabolism in the shoots and needles, causing loss of water balance. The result is brown coloration of the needles and leaf drop. As with many other wood pests, fine resin drops in wasp <b>boreholes</b> {{are found in the}} central trunk. Attacked pines tend to develop flagging. Tip dieback begins with the needles becoming chlorotic and changing from green to yellowish-red, finally turning completely brown over a three- to six-month period. The wasp bores 1/8- to 3/8-inch-diameter holes in the tree. Unstressed trees may be attacked uniformly along the main stem, while trees with low osmotic phloem pressure are preferentially attacked, with denser clusters of <b>boreholes.</b>|$|E

5|$|Conversely, the {{woodwasp}} {{is fully}} {{dependent on the}} symbionts. Decomposition enables the larvae to unlock the wood by producing white rot. The mycetangia of this and other wasps from the family Siricidae support {{a close relationship with}} saprobiontic fungi. Without the process of decomposition of the host tree and weakening of the infested tree, the development of larvae is arrested. If the tree can recover from the consequences of the wasp secretion, it blocks the <b>boreholes</b> with resin, thus killing the larvae.|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} are performed with an isotropic Lucite <b>borehole</b> model {{to measure the}} acoustic wave fields generated by a monopole source in the <b>borehole.</b> The source not only generates acoustic waves propagating along the <b>borehole,</b> {{but also in the}} surrounding formation. If there is a reflection interface in the formation, the acoustic waves can be reflected back to the <b>borehole.</b> We measure the acoustic waves on the model surface to investigate the acoustic fields in the formation. Acoustic measurements record both waves reflected from an interface or fracture and those propagating in the <b>borehole.</b> The frequency of the reflection is higher than that of the <b>borehole</b> waves, and the apparent velocity of the reflection is higher than the P-wave velocity. In this paper, we extract the waves reflected from an interface—which is parallel or declined to the <b>borehole</b> axis—with a high-pass filter. If the apparent velocity of the acoustic wave recorded in a <b>borehole</b> is faster than that of the P-wave propagating along the <b>borehole,</b> the wave must be reflected by a surface outside of the <b>borehole.</b> With these measured waveforms we calculate the distance between the <b>borehole</b> and the reflection surface and the P-wave velocity in the direction perpendicular to the <b>borehole</b> axis. When the reflection is declined to the <b>borehole</b> axis, the reflected waves recorded at both sides of the source have different first-arrival-times and different apparent velocities. Laboratory measurements show a new method to determine an interface out of a <b>borehole,</b> the formation anisotropy, and the distance of a reflection. Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

30|$|Underground {{structures}} are always under pressure because of vertical and tectonic stresses. When a <b>borehole</b> is drilled inside a structure, {{some parts of}} (rock) materials are missed. <b>Borehole’s</b> side walls are maintained only by fluid pressure. Since this fluid pressure is not consistent with in situ structure stresses, new stress redistribution occurs around <b>borehole</b> {{that may lead to}} rock fracture. Therefore, identification of stresses existent around a <b>borehole</b> is of great importance to examine <b>borehole</b> problems. There are two common types of <b>borehole</b> fracture: first one is drilling induced tension fracture (DITF) and the second one, with 90 ° of difference, is called breakout. In a substance with linear elastic behavior, centralization of bigger stress occurs on <b>borehole</b> wall, so <b>borehole</b> fracture is expected to start from this area.|$|R
5|$|Drilling <b>boreholes</b> {{through the}} Hamilton Group shales in the {{subsurface}} can be problematic. The Marcellus has {{a relatively low}} density, and these shales may not be chemically compatible with some drilling fluids. The shale is relatively fragile, and may fracture under pressure, causing a problem in circulating the drilling fluid back up through the borehole known as lost circulation. The formation may also be under-pressurized, further complicating the drilling process.|$|E
5|$|Terraforming is {{a natural}} {{outgrowth}} of colonizing an alien world. The first playable prototype was just a map generator that tested climate changes during the game. This required the designers to create a world builder program and climatic model far more powerful than anything they'd done before. Temperature, wind, and rainfall patterns were modeled in ways that allow players to make changes: for example, creating a ridge-line and then watching the effects. In addition to raising terrain, the player can also divert rivers, dig huge <b>boreholes</b> into the planet's mantle, and melt ice caps.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD), the Chinese had drilled deep <b>boreholes</b> to {{transport}} natural gas from bamboo pipelines to stoves where cast iron evaporation pans boiled brine to extract salt. During the Tang dynasty, a gazetteer of Sichuan province stated {{that at one}} of these 182m (600ft) 'fire wells', men collected natural gas into portable bamboo tubes which could be carried around for dozens of km (mi) and still produce a flame. These were essentially the first gas cylinders; Robert Temple assumes some sort of tap was used for this device.|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{establish}} the existence of the critical condition of <b>borehole</b> stability during air drilling. Rock Failure Process Analysis Code 2 D was used to set up a damage model of the <b>borehole</b> excavated in strain-softening rock. Damage evolution around the <b>borehole</b> was studied by tracking acoustic emission. The study indicates that excavation damaged zone (EDZ) is formed around <b>borehole</b> because of stress concentration after the <b>borehole</b> is excavated. There is a critical condition for <b>borehole</b> stability; the <b>borehole</b> will collapse when the critical damage condition is reached. The critical condition of underground excavation exists not only in elastic and ideal plastic material but in strain-softening material as well. The research is helpful to developing an evaluation method of <b>borehole</b> stability during air drilling.|$|R

5|$|The {{water that}} {{flows through the}} Roman Baths is {{considered}} unsafe for bathing, partly due to its having passed through the still-functioning original lead pipes, and up until World War II, it was advertised {{on the basis of}} the radioactivity it contained. However, the more significant danger is now considered to be infectious diseases. In October 1978, a young girl swimming with the Bath Dolphins, a local swimming club, in the restored Roman Bath contracted meningitis and died, leading to the closure of the bath for several years. Tests showed that Naegleria fowleri, an extremely dangerous disease-causing amoeba, was in the water. The newly constructed Thermae Bath Spa nearby, designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners, and the refurbished Cross Bath allow modern-day bathers to experience the waters via a series of more recently drilled <b>boreholes.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a method-of-moments (MoM) {{analysis}} {{that includes the}} <b>borehole</b> effects on crosshole <b>borehole</b> radar, and we verify that the MoM represents the crosshole <b>borehole</b> radar data correctly. We derive the far-field approximation of an electric field radiated by an electric point source. In this derivation, {{we assume that the}} point source is in a cylindrically layered medium, while the observed electric field is in another cylindrically layered medium. The equations that are derived are used as a transfer function to connect the two impedance matrices—one for the transmitting antenna and the other one for the receiving one. In these matrices, the influence of the scattered field by the <b>borehole</b> is included completely. We conducted field experiments in granite with a controlled <b>borehole</b> medium in order to investigate the influence of the <b>borehole.</b> In this paper, we estimated the relative amplitude and the group delay of the received signals between the water-filled <b>borehole</b> case and the air-filled <b>borehole</b> case.

5|$|Falling {{electricity}} production may be boosted through drilling additional supply <b>boreholes,</b> as at Poihipi and Ohaaki. The Wairakei power station {{has been running}} much longer, with its first unit commissioned in November 1958, and it attained its peak generation of 173MW in 1965, but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering, in 1982 being derated to intermediate pressure and the station managing 157MW. Around {{the start of the}} 21st century it was managing about 150MW, then in 2005 two 8MW isopentane systems were added, boosting the station's output by about 14MW. Detailed data are unavailable, being lost due to re-organisations. One such re-organisation in 1996 causes the absence of early data for Poihipi (started 1996), and the gap in 1996/7 for Wairakei and Ohaaki; half-hourly data for Ohaaki's first few months of operation are also missing, as well as for most of Wairakei's history.|$|E
5|$|Larvae of Sirex {{woodwasp}} develop through arrhenotoky: male larvae develop {{only from}} unfertilized eggs, the females only from fertilized ones. Usually, 10 males are produced per female, but the ratio varies between 20:1 and 1:1. The larvae hatch after eight {{days at the}} earliest, but in some exterior conditions, they may remain in the egg for several months. At the optimal temperature of around 25°C (77°F), they hatch out after 10 to 12 days. Although the larvae hatch at 30°C (86°F) {{two to three days}} earlier, they are 20% more likely to die. Such extreme temperatures result in slower development, and below 6.2°C (43°F), the larvae die. A sufficient interspersion of the wood with the mycelium of the woodwasp is crucial for its hatching, as the fungus prevents the wood from drying out. Without these prerequisites, hatching is not possible. The tree can only ward off the infestation if it floods the <b>boreholes</b> with resin or halts the fungus by producing a wall of polyphenols.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a {{realignment}} of the Glaven channel {{meant that}} the Eye would be left unprotected {{to the north of}} the river, and would eventually be destroyed by coastal change. It was decided that the only practical course of action was to investigate the site while it still existed, and a preliminary evaluation was carried out in 2003 as preparation for a full survey in 2004–05. The surveyed area covered 10ha (25acre), significantly more than the 0.4ha (1acre) of the 1998 investigations. 50 trenches were excavated in a herringbone pattern outside the buildings, each 50m long and 1.80m wide (194 by 5.9ft), and six trenches of varying dimensions were created inside the chapel. The latter equated in total area to two of the standard trenches. The geology was investigated with eight <b>boreholes,</b> and geophysics (magnetometry and metal detection) were used to locate subsurface anomalies.|$|E
40|$|Computer {{simulation}} of <b>borehole</b> ground heat exchangers used in geothermal heat pump systems was conducted using three-dimensional implicit {{finite difference method}} with rectangular coordinate system. Each <b>borehole</b> was approximated by a square column circumscribed by the <b>borehole</b> radius. <b>Borehole</b> loading profile calculated numerically based on the prescribed <b>borehole</b> temperature profile under quasi-steady state conditions {{was used to determine}} the ground temperature and the <b>borehole</b> temperature profile. The two coupled solutions were solved iteratively at each time step. The simulated ground temperature was calibrated using a cylindrical source model by adjusting the grid spacing and adopting a load factor of 1. 047 in the difference equation. With constant load applied to a single <b>borehole,</b> neither the <b>borehole</b> temperature nor the <b>borehole</b> loading was constant along the <b>borehole.</b> The ground temperature profiles were not similar at different distances from the <b>borehole.</b> This meant that a single finite difference scheme was not sufficient to estimate the performance of a borefield by superposition. The entire borefield should be discretized simultaneously. Comparison was made between the present method and the finite line source model with superposition. The discrepancies between the results from the two methods increased with the scale of borefield. The introduction of time schedule revealed a discrepancy between the load applied to the ground heat exchanger and that transferred from the <b>borehole</b> to the ground, which was usually assumed to be the same when using analytical models. Hence, in designing a large borefield, the present method should give more precise results in dynamic simulation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
