40|$|Pathology {{laboratories}} group {{some tests}} that they perform on their high throughput <b>biochemistry</b> <b>analysers</b> into profiles of tests {{that are associated}} with different organs (e. g. liver function tests—LFT). The components of these profiles are historic and often vary between different laboratories. This can lead to confusion and begs the question of what should be in a particular profile. In community medicine profiles may be used as screening tests but some of the components of the profiles may have low sensitivity and specificity and may produce both false positives and negatives. The LFT may include components which are poor liver function tests but are sensitive to fatty liver and hence elevations may cause unnecessary concern. Harmonisation of clinical chemistry reference intervals and units is occurring now so it is time to consider a similar process for components of a profile. A proposed list of analytes to be performed in the LFT profile is given...|$|R
40|$|Eighteen healthy skeletally mature (3 years old) ewes, with {{an average}} weight of 45 kg, of the Portuguese Churra da Terra Quente breed were used to {{evaluate}} the normal values of total and bone-specific isoform of alkaline phosphatase serum activities (ALP and BALP, respectively) and serum osteocalcin (OC) and their correlation with the serum minerals – calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg) and ionized calcium (Ca 2 þ). The sheep were maintained under controlled environmental conditions (constant diurnal photoperiod cycle and identical husbandry and feeding) for six weeks before the collection of the blood samples. The measurement of the total ALP and serum minerals was performed with automated <b>biochemistry</b> <b>analysers</b> using the BioMe´rieuxw kits, the serum electrolyte Ca 2 þ Diametrics Medical, Incw specific cassettes and the BALP and OC METRATM kits from QUIDELw Corporation. The mean+standard deviation values obtained were: total ALP 90. 17 + 85. 72 U/L, BALP 15. 0 + 5. 44 U/L, ratio BALP/ total ALP 29. 28 + 24. 22, OC 13. 02 + 1. 87 ng/mL, Ca 2. 57 + 0. 37 mmol/L, P 2. 13 + 0. 42 mmol/L, Mg 1. 04 + 0. 13 mmol/L, Ca 2 þ 1. 29 + 0. 04 mmol/L. Significant correlations were observed between the total ALP and Ca (r ¼ 0. 5939; P ¼ 0. 05) and OC and Ca (r ¼ 0. 5706; P ¼ 0. 05). Reference to the serum values of bone turnover parameters in sheep could be of great value in research and could provide complementary non-invasive information on the bone healing process, particularly with regard to obtaining an early prognosis of fracture healing...|$|R
40|$|A silicon-based {{biosensor}} chip {{consisting of}} {{an array of}} amperometric enzyme sensors has been developed for monitoring the concentration of glutamate and glutamine in cell-culture fermentation processes. The glutamate sensor was constructed by immobilising glutamate oxidase, while the glutamine sensor by sequential coupling of glutaminase and glutamate oxidase. The enzymes were immobilised by means of cross-linking with glutaraldehyde {{on the surface of}} the patterned platinum thin-film electrodes. The developed biosensors have been electrochemically characterised in solutions with different concentrations of glutamate and glutamine in terms of sensitivity, response time, linear working range and lifetime. A high sensitivity of 96 nA/mM and 100 nA/mM was registered for the glutamate and glutamine sensors, respectively. The preliminary experiments in cell-culture medium have shown a good correlation between the glutamine and glutamate concentrations measured with the biosensor chip and the commercially available <b>biochemistry</b> <b>analyser.</b> The obtained results demonstrate the feasibility of the realised biosensor chip for monitoring the glutamine and glutamate concentrations in fermentation processes.

40|$|Oil palm trunks {{are one of}} the {{potential}} lignocellulosic sources for monosaccharides production. Acid hydrolysis and enzymatic hydrolysis method were combined to obtain higher yield of monosaccharides. Therefore,this paper was designed to study the effect of particle size of oil palm trunk (OPT) on the production of xylose,glucose and arabinose. In acid hydrolysis, 3. 24 % sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) was used at temperature of 121 °C for 40 minutes to degrade the hemicelluloses thus generates xylose. The filtrate was analysed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The result showed that the highest xylose, glucose and arabinose generated were 14. 092 g/L, 10. 233 g/L and 4. 761 g/L respectively at 160 μm particle size. Solid wastes from acid hydrolysis were degraded by cellulotic enzyme to produce glucose and the hydrolysate was analysed using YSI <b>Biochemistry</b> <b>Analyser.</b> The highest glucose produced was 2. 82 g/L at 800 μm particle size. Overall, the highest glucose production was 12. 873 g/L at 160 μm particle size. As the conclusion, combination of both methods helps in increasing the glucose production and reduces the abundant waste of biomass. From this research,it is recommended that purification method should be done in order to obtain high purity of xylose,glucose and arabinos...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of animal-side <b>biochemistry</b> <b>analysers</b> in {{veterinary}} practice, the requirement for ready access to reliable means for interpretation of the results is of increasing importance. At the University of Glasgow Veterinary School (GUVS), a large computerised hospital database containing extensive clinical, laboratory, and pathological information has been maintained. A retrospective study was undertaken to investigate plasma biochemistry results and corresponding post mortem diagnosis data from 754 unwell cattle which had presented to GUVS over the study period. Initial analysis of the clinical biochemistry data from this unwell population revealed that the parameters did not follow a normal distribution. This finding suggested that the accepted reference range method for the interpretation of clinical biochemistry data may provide limited information about the unwell animal. By applying a combination of percentile analysis and conditional probability techniques to the hospital data, {{the development of a}} means of clinical biochemistry interpretation was developed whereby a clinician could determine whether a value was abnormal, the degree of abnormality, and the most likely associated diseases. For example, a urea value of 30 mmol/ 1 lay within the top 5 % of results, {{and one of the most}} common diseases associated with this urea value was pyelonephritis. Furthermore, a Bayesian approach allowed the quantification of the relationship between any plasma biochemistry value and disease through the generation of a ratio termed the 'biochemical factor'. Using the same example, given a urea value of 30 mmol/ 1, pyelonephritis was eight times more likely than before any biochemistry information was known. The results from the study were used to form the basis of a software system which may ultimately be used by the clinician to aid in the recognition, treatment and prevention of disease in the veterinary domain...|$|R

Falcor 350 is a wet-reagent <b>biochemistry</b> <b>analyser</b> that is available for in-house use. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the results produced by this analyser with those obtained by the KoneLab 30 i that served as the reference instrument. Blood samples from 60 clinical cases were analysed for urea, creatinine, total proteins, albumin, creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, total calcium, phosphate, sodium, and potassium using both instruments. Good to excellent correlations (rs value) value) were identified for creatinine (0. 88), total proteins (0. 92), albumin (0. 93), creatine kinase (0. 98), aspartate aminotransferase (0. 98), alkaline phosphatase (0. 94), total bilirubin (0. 98), phosphate (0. 95), and potassium (0. 97). The correlations for total calcium (0. 71), sodium (0. 68), and urea (0. 64) were fair. For albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, phosphate, potassium, total bilirubin, creatinine, and total proteins, the two instruments produce values that are closely related to each other and are sufficiently similar to allow them to be used interchangeably without the need for additional correction factor computations. Because of differences in the methodologies, the Falcor results for alkaline phosphatase, total calcium, and sodium cannot be used interchangeably and should be interpreted using reference intervals established from th...|$|E
40|$|The overall aim of {{this project}} was to provide an {{evidence-based}} means for comparison of feline biochemical analytes to increase the ability to distinguish between sickness and health of cats and enhance veterinarians’ clinical decision-making. Chapter 1, the literature review, has two sections; the first outlines how traditional, population-based reference intervals are generated, followed by a description of subject-based reference limits that are being implemented in human clinical pathology. The second section describes the current approaches for method comparison of analyte values obtained from clinical pathology analysers. Since in-house biochemistry analysers are unable to be calibrated by end-users (such as veterinary hospital staff), any inherent bias in the determination of analyte values cannot be corrected (as it can for commercial laboratory analysers). Bias of in-house biochemistry equipment is well recognised, and Chapter 2 provides the first concurrent assessment of multiple analysers, using a grading system that was devised to assess constant bias and degree of proportional bias. It conclusively demonstrates that results from in-house analysers should not be directly compared to results from others, nor to those determined by commercial laboratory analysers. A potential solution {{may lie in the}} ability of correctly generated reference intervals to account for these analysers’ inherent bias. Chapter 3 demonstrates that reference intervals provided by in-house <b>biochemistry</b> <b>analyser</b> manufacturers as well as a commercial laboratory do not appear to account for the biases for all analytes and consequently may be inaccurate for local hospital population feline populations. It is now recognised in human clinical pathology, that for many biochemical analytes, traditional population-based reference intervals have limitations, as a significant change in an individual’s analyte concentration within the reference limits may still be an important medical indicator for that individual. Conversely, values outside these limits are not always clinically important for an individual. For appropriate analytes, subject-based reference values, often called ‘reference change values’ are used; these are determined from biological variation data which reflect the inherent physiological variation of these analytes within and between individuals. Chapter 4 defines the biological variation of clinical biochemical analytes in cats, determining which analytes are suited for traditional reference interval interpretation or would be better interpreted with reference change values. The high individuality found for most analytes indicate that subject-based reference values (which are determined and documented) should be used to assess feline plasma biochemistry samples. The generation of biological variation data enabled assessment of precision (repeatability) of in-house analysers in relation to this data, the recognised technique for human clinical pathology. These results are documented in Chapter 5 which found that the precision of results from these in-house and commercial laboratory analysers were generally acceptable, so large differences between repeated results from the same patient {{are more likely to be}} due to biological changes rather than analyser variation. Chapter 6 assesses the total error (based on a combination of bias and precision) of values from three in-house biochemistry analysers in relation to a commercial laboratory analyser for feline plasma using multiple quality specifications. This study required an adaptation of method comparison techniques used for human clinical pathology so that these techniques could be used with equipment that is unable to be calibrated. This chapter concludes that in-house analysers provide acceptable results and few clinical decisions would be different based on the results determined by three in-house analysers compared to those determined by the commercial laboratory. The last chapter is a discussion on the impact this research will have on veterinary practice, the projects’ limitations and future directions for this avenue of research...|$|E
