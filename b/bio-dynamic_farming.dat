40|$|Usage {{of mineral}} {{supplements}} regarding avoidance of lacks in supply (especially phosphor or selenium) and fulfilling {{the ideal of}} a closed materials cycle within a farm is controversial discussed among bio-dynamic farmers. A representative survey in Swiss and German <b>bio-dynamic</b> dairy <b>farms</b> was conducted to investigate the mineral feeding strategies of bio-dynamic farmers and the relationships between farm characteristic and usage of mineral supplements. It was shown that 30 % of the dairy herds were fed without external mineral supplements whereas 97 % were fed with salt. Farms in highlands, with loamy soils, a high amount of permanent grassland and lower yielding dairy cows were associated with lower use of mineral supplements. Alternatively most often feeding of fresh or dried leaves of trees and hedges were mentioned in the questionnaire. The survey results demonstrated the differences in usage of mineral supplements in <b>bio-dynamic</b> <b>farms</b> and determined further need {{of research in the}} area of mineral supplementation...|$|R

5000|$|In July 1939, Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, {{the author}} of the {{standard}} work on biodynamic agriculture (<b>Bio-Dynamic</b> <b>Farming</b> and Gardening), came to the UK at the invitation of Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne as a presenter at the Betteshanger Summer School and Conference on Biodynamic Farming at Northbourne's farm in Kent. One of the chief purposes of the conference was to bring together the proponents of various approaches to organic agriculture in order that they might cooperate within a larger movement. Howard attended the conference, where he met Pfeiffer. In the following year, Northbourne published his manifesto of organic farming, Look to the Land, in which he coined the term [...] "organic farming."

40|$|This year marks a centenary of the {{synthetic}} fertilizer industry. German chemists, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch, in 1909 demonstrated their industrial {{process for the}} manufacture of ammonia. The achievement won them accolades including Nobel Prizes. The output of their Haber-Bosch process {{can be used for}} either peace or war, agriculture or munitions, and the rapid adoption by Germany of this industrial process is credited with prolonging WW 1. Most of {{the synthetic}} nitrogenous fertilizer of the past century, and right up to the present, has been manufactured using the Haber-Bosch process. The use of synthetic fertilizers has led to significant negative environmental outcomes. Rudolf Steiner was an early voice against chemical agriculture. Steiner's Agriculture Course of 1924 led to the development and world-wide proliferation of <b>Bio-dynamic</b> Agriculture, a <b>farming</b> system which has always championed the biological fixation of nitrogen by soil micro-organisms. This paper identifies ten key differences between biological and Haber-Bosch chemical fixation of nitrogen...|$|R
40|$|State of the Art: The {{majority}} of vine bio-dynamic growers report positive experiences {{in terms of}} plant production but also wine quality. However, quantitative and scientifically proved data are not available. However {{there is a high}} interest of the wine growers for appoved data on the efficiency of the bio-dynamic preparations. As in other countries bio-dynamic viticulture is rapidly growing in Switzerland. However, there is very little scientific evidence for the efficiency of the preparations. Thus, science-based recommendations for its use or optimisation cannot be given. Project aims including target group: To show the quantitative effects of bio-dynamic preparations on parameters of plant growth, disease tolerance, soil properties and finally also on vine quality. An additional goal of the project is the management improvement of the bio-dynamic growers participating in the trials. The results may show possibilities to optimize the standard and the specific bio-dynamic management measures of the growers. Methodology: In 2003 the project team that includes 4 bio-dynamic growers installed an On-Farm trial on 4 different sites of <b>bio-dynamic</b> vine <b>farms.</b> At each site 4 different treatment blocks are separated: a) with preparation 500 and with prep. 501; b) with 500 alone; c) with 501 alone; d) no preparations. Several times of the year plant growth and health is assessed. Vine quality is assessed by separated microvinifcation per treatment and site. The management of the 4 vineyards is harmonized. Results, conclusion, state of the art: First results do not show differences in disease incidence. There was a tendency found for more chlorophyll in leaves where prep. 501 is applied. At two sites there was a tendency for improvement of the quality of soil aggregates where 500 is applied...|$|R
50|$|In 1938, Ehrenfried Pfeiffer's text <b>Bio-Dynamic</b> <b>Farming</b> and Gardening was {{published}} in five languages - English, Dutch, Italian, French, and German; this became the standard {{work in the field}} for several decades. In July 1939, at the invitation of Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne, Pfeiffer travelled to the UK and presented the Betteshanger Summer School and Conference on Biodynamic Farming' at Northbourne's farm in Kent. The conference has been described as the 'missing link' between biodynamic agriculture and organic farming because, in the year after Betteshanger, Northbourne published his manifesto of organic farming, Look to the Land, in which he coined the term 'organic farming' and praised the methods of Rudolf Steiner. In the 1950s, Hans Mueller was encouraged by Steiner's work to create the organic-biological farming method in Switzerland; this later developed to become the largest certifier of organic products in Europe, Bioland.|$|E

30|$|The {{realization}} of negative impacts of industrial inputs in agriculture, pesticide residues in food, especially {{in respect of}} small holder producer communities, {{has led to a}} resurgence of various low cost smallholder farmer and consumer friendly alternatives, replacing the high risk and cost (including environmental and human costs) of external input based agriculture. There are indeed a variety of agricultural systems in India and across the world. These have been responses to the crisis arising out of conventional scale economies based industrial agriculture systems in both production and distribution. Some of the major variants of sustainable practices and concepts have been agro ecology, sustainable food systems, ecological agriculture, sustainable agriculture, integrated agriculture, low external input sustainable agriculture, organic farming, natural farming, natueco farming, <b>bio-dynamic</b> <b>farming,</b> permaculture, zero budget Farming, indigenous micro-organism based farming, effective micro-organism based farming, etc.|$|E
40|$|In 1974, the Swiss Federal Office of Agriculture (BLW) {{charged the}} former Federal Research Station for Agricultural Chemistry and Hygiene of Environment (FAC, Bern-Liebefeld) {{to set up}} a field trial in {{collaboration}} with the FiBL in order to compare the performance of organic farming systems. When FAC-Liebefeld was shut down, the Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology and Agriculture (FAL-Reckenholz) took over the responsibility for the DOK trial in close cooperation with FiBL. The DOK-long term trial - unique in its conception - compares the consequences of bio-organic, <b>bio-dynamic</b> and conventional <b>farming</b> systems in a randomised plot trial that has no other equivalent. Experimental samples are used by many other laboratories to develop new methods in the areas of soil and food quality. The strategies of fertilization and plant protection are the main differences between the systems, whereas crop rotation and soil tillage were almost identical. The area where the DOK-trial is located, is documented to have long been in use as arable land (1957 – 1973 ley rotation, 1973 – 1975 field legumes and cereals, 1976 oats). In May 1977 the whole area was sown with grass-clover, and in the spring of 1978 the field experiment began with potatoes, spring wheat and spring barley. ...|$|R
40|$|Biodynamic {{agriculture}} and organic farming have {{been regarded as}} having different provenances and having arisen independently. The present account introduces the ‘missing link’ between the two. In 1938 Ehrenfried Pfeiffer published the milestone book on biodynamics: <b>Bio-Dynamic</b> <b>Farming</b> and Gardening. In 1940 Lord Northbourne published Look to the Land, the work that introduced the term ‘organic farming’. In the summer of the intervening year, Pfeiffer travelled from Switzerland to Northbourne’s estate in Kent, UK, and presented for British farmers a nine day course on biodynamics, the Betteshanger Summer School and Conference on <b>Bio-Dynamic</b> <b>Farming,</b> 1 - 9 July 1939. Pfeiffer {{was supported by the}} pre-eminent biodynamic scholar-practitioners, Otto Eckstein and Hans Heinze. Dr Scott Williamson of the Peckham Experiment was the sole British lecturer at the Betteshanger Summer School. For the UK Bio-Dynamic Association, the Betteshanger Summer School was the highlight of the year. Northbourne and Pfeiffer had collaborated on the Farleigh Experiment in 1938, and Northbourne had travelled to Switzerland in January 1939 to arrange Pfeiffer’s visit. War broke out less than eight weeks after the Betteshanger Summer School. Northbourne’s manifesto on organic agriculture, Look to the Land, was published in May of the following year. The book took the Steinerian and biodynamic view of ‘the farm as an organism’ as its central tenet and adopted it as the nominative motif for ‘organic’ farming. The book offered to the Anglophone world an account that was secular and distanced from any Anthroposophic or Germanic roots. Subsequently, Northbourne sought to bring Pfeiffer to the UK but Pfeiffer’s next and final visit was in 1950. The Betteshanger Summer School and Conference on biodynamics has been otherwise unreported. As this account demonstrates, Betteshanger was a stepping stone from biodynamics to organics. Northbourne sponsored Pfeiffer’s visit and the Betteshanger biodynamics conference in 1939, and the following year he introduced his term ‘organic farming’ and its philosophy in his book Look to the Land...|$|E
40|$|The Glass House (1914) is {{the oldest}} extant {{building}} designed by Rudolf Steiner. Now nearing its centenary, the Glass House of Dornach has served as home for two enduring anthroposophic endeavours. It was the production centre for the vibrantly-coloured engraved glass windows of the Goetheanum, {{and it was the}} crucible for evolving Rudolf Steiner’s Koberwitz lectures through to ‘biodynamic agriculture’, Steiner’s new agriculture for the world. In 1919 Guenther Wachsmuth (1893 - 1963) and Ehrenfried Pfeiffer (1899 - 1961) had set up a research laboratory {{in the basement of the}} Glass House. In 1924 the Agricultural Experimental Circle was founded at Koberwitz with the results to be reported to the Natural Science Section of the Goetheanum at Dornach. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer henceforth devoted his life to the advancement of biodynamic agriculture and brought it to public awareness with his 1938 book, <b>Bio-Dynamic</b> <b>Farming</b> and Gardening, published in five languages. Photographs are included of the Glass House, Engraved glass by Assya Turgeniev for the Goetheanum, Ehrenfried Pfeiffer's laboratory, and Sonnenhof at Arlesheim, site of the earliest BD preparations...|$|E
40|$|The short black comic film Asylum (2011, Directed by Joern Utkilen) {{depicts the}} lives of two {{migrants}} Alfred Islami (Mihai Arsene) and Wan Yun Ji (Andy Cheung) living through the interminable time of an immigration detention centre in Scotland. Immigration detention, Asylum reveals, is characterised by an excess of time. In the absurdist tradition of Samuel Beckett’s ‘Waiting for Godot’ (1953) the detainees ‘can only kill time, as they are slowly killed by it’ (Bauman 1998 : p. 88). Alfred Islami dreams of running a biodynamic farm, he spends time reading about <b>bio-dynamic</b> <b>farming</b> methods, acting out his farming fantasies with the few props, chairs, pot-plants, rubber gloves, at his disposal and attempting to procure potatoes and cows from detention officials. Alfred shares a shabby room in the detention centre with Wan Yun Ji (Andy Cheung). While Alfred spends his time playing farmer in order to ‘kill time’, Wan Yun Ji engages in repeated acts of self-harm, including cutting his wrists in a failed suicide attempt and throwing himself through the glass window of his detention centre room. These different strategies of survival represent attempts not only to pass time but to sustain some semblance of agency and self-determination. These are activities which stave off (the seemingly inevitable) psychological deterioration into zombie-like “dead but undead” states of being, which overwhelm detainees around the...|$|E
40|$|Australia’s {{involvement}} in the organic movement has proceeded in four district waves of activity. The First Wave (1920 s & 1930 s) {{was that of the}} Australian anthroposophists who joined Rudolf Steiner’s Agricultural Experimental Circle of Anthroposophic Farmers and Gardeners and culminated with the ‘coming out’ of biodynamic agriculture in 1938 with Ehrenfried Pfeiffer’s book <b>Bio-Dynamic</b> <b>Farming</b> and Gardening and in Australia with Bob Williams presenting the first public lecture on biodynamics at the home of Walter Burley and Marion Mahoney Griffin. The Second Wave of organic agriculture in Australia (1940 s & 1950 s) is anchored by the coining of the term ‘organic farming’ in 1940, in England and it saw the founding of the first associations in Australia dedicated to the advocacy of organics. The Australian Organic Farming and Gardening Society (AOFGS) was founded in 1944 in Sydney and preceded the UK's Soil Association by two years. The Third Wave (1960 s & 1970 s) is anchored by the publication of Rachel Carson’s book Silent Spring in 1962 which breathed new life into the organics movement worldwide. Many new associations and periodicals for the promotion, advocacy and exploration of organics appeared in the two decades that followed Carson. The Fourth Wave (1980 s to present) is anchored by the Chernobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine in 1986 which dramatically refocused the world’s attention on the safety of its food supply. This Fourth Wave of the organics movement witnessed the maturing of organics thinking in Australia and the development of the apparatus of organics governance. The first organics certifiers were established along with the establishment of standards, logos, labeling and product differentiation...|$|E
40|$|An {{incubation}} {{experiment on}} straw decomposition {{was carried out}} with soils from a long-term field trial at Therwil, Switzerland. Two conventional agricultural systems, one with (CONFYM) and one without manure, an organic system managed according to <b>bio-dynamic</b> <b>farming</b> practice (BIODYN) and an unfertilized control were compared. CONFYM received stacked manure and an additional mineral fertilizer. BIODYN received composted farmyard manure and no mineral fertilizers. Both systems received {{the same amount of}} manure based on 1. 4 livestock units haˇ 1. The aim of the investigation was to explain the large differences in soil microbial biomass and activity between the systems, especially between the manured soils. Di€erences in microbial C-utilization effciency were suggested to be the main reason. We followed the decomposition of 14 C-labeled plant material over a period of 177 days under controled incubation conditions. Prior to incubation, microbial biomass was 75 % higher and qCO 2 up to 43 % lower in the BIODYN soil than in the conventional soils. At the end of the incubation period, 58 % of the applied plant material was mineralized to CO 2 in the BIODYN soil compared to 50 % in the other soils. This difference became signifcant 2 weeks after application of plant material and is suggested to be due to decomposition of more recalcitrant compounds. After addition of plant material, the increase of microbial biomass in the unmanured systems was higher than in the manured systems, but with a higher loss rate thereafter. The amount of 14 C incorporated into Cmic as related to 14 CO 2 evolved was markedly higher in the BIODYN soil. The results support the hypothesis that agricultural measures applied to the BIODYN system invoke a higher efciency of the soil microbial community with respect to substrate use for growth...|$|E
40|$|Organic farming (OF) is {{considered}} a promising solution for reducing environmental burdens related to intensive agricultural management practices. The question arises whether OF really reduces the environmental impacts once lower yields and all the changes in farming methods are taken into consideration. This question is addressed in a comprehensive study of Swiss arable cropping and forage production systems comparing OF to integrated production (IP) systems {{by means of the}} life cycle assessment (LCA) method. The LCA study investigated the environmental impacts of two long-term farming system experiments: the DOC experiment comparing bio-dynamic, bio-organic and conventional/integrated farming and the "Burgrain" experiment encompassing integrated intensive, integrated extensive and organic production. All treatments received similar amounts of farmyard manure. The system boundary encompasses the plant production system; storage and application of farmyard manure is included in the system boundary, the animal husbandry is not included. The Swiss Agricultural Life Cycle Assessment method (SALCA) was used to analyse the environmental impacts. In the overall assessment OF was revealed to be either superior or similar to IP in environmental terms. OF has its main strengths in better resource conservation, since the farming system relies mainly on farm-internal resources and limits the input of external auxiliary materials. This results in less fossil and mineral resources being consumed. Moreover the greatly restricted use of pesticides makes it possible to markedly reduce ecotoxicity potentials on the one hand, and to achieve a higher biodiversity potential on the other. This overall positive assessment is not valid for all organic products: some products such as potatoes had higher environmental burdens than their counterparts from IP. The main drawbacks identified for Swiss OF systems are lower yields. As a consequence some production factors are used less efficiently, thus partly negating the advantages of OF. Furthermore, the different manure management strategy leads to relatively high nutrient losses in relation to yield. These two points were shown to be the main priorities for the environmental optimisation of OF systems. The differences between the bio-organic and the <b>bio-dynamic</b> <b>farming</b> systems consisted in a slightly higher input of organic matter, a few applications of mineral fertilisers and copper applications in the former. The eco-efficiency analysis led {{to the conclusion that the}} optimisation of OF is mainly output-driven, i. e. that higher yields of good quality should be achieved with the available (limited) resources. On the contrary, optimisation of IP was found to be input-driven; the inputs should be used in a quantity and manner which minimise the environmental burdens per unit produced. The study showed that despite the efforts of recent years, there is still considerable room for the environmental optimisation of Swiss farming systems.
