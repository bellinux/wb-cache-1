25|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} impact of De Leon and the SLP was their help in founding the Industrial Workers of the World in 1905. <b>Before</b> <b>too</b> long, however they had a falling out with the element that they termed 'the bummery,' and left to form their own rival union, also called the Industrial Workers of the World, based in Detroit. De Leon died in 1914, and with his passing this organization lost its central focus. This body was renamed the Workers International Industrial Union (WIIU) and declined into little more than SLP members. The WIIU was wound up in 1924.|$|E
25|$|The peace {{established}} in Sicily at the Congress of Gela {{did not last}} long. Shortly after the Congress, Syracuse intervened in an episode of civil strife between the democratic and oligarchic parties in Leontini, supporting the oligarchs. <b>Before</b> <b>too</b> long, the prospect of foreign domination had united the Leontinians, and the two parties united in war against Syracuse. Athens had sent an emissary to Sicily in 422 to sound {{out the possibility of}} renewing the war against Syracuse, but achieved nothing. In 416, however, a second Sicilian conflict provided the invitation Athens had sought in 422. The city of Segesta—an Athenian ally in the 420s—went to war against Selinus and, after losing an initial battle, sent to Athens for help. In order to win the Athenians' support, the Segestaeans claimed that they were capable of funding much of the cost of sending a fleet, offering 60 talents of uncoined silver up front, and tricking Athenian ambassadors into believing that the city was more prosperous than it actually was, by making sure that the ambassadors saw all their golden and other valuable objects in a way as if these were just part of what they had.|$|E

500|$|As Harold Wilson did {{not have}} an overall {{majority}} after the February 1974 election, he was widely expected to call another election <b>before</b> <b>too</b> long; he did so in September 1974. Thorpe anticipated {{a turning point in the}} Liberals' fortunes and campaigned under the slogan [...] "one more heave", aiming for a complete breakthrough with entering a coalition a last resort. The phrase is attributed to advertising agent and Liberal parliamentary candidate Adrian Slade. The slogan was memorable, but considered uninspiring. Future Liberal Party leader David Steel called the whole campaign [...] "a slightly less successful re-run of February." [...] In the October 1974 general election, the Liberals received over 700,000 fewer votes and returned 13 MPs, down one, with Wilson achieving an overall majority of three.|$|E
500|$|Accompanied by Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams and 16 policemen, Shippard {{arrived in}} mid-October 1888. The king {{suspended}} concession negotiations {{in favour of}} meetings with him. The colonial official told the king that the Boers were hungry for more land and intended to overrun his country <b>before</b> <b>too</b> long; he also championed Rudd's cause, telling Lobengula that Rudd's team acted {{on behalf of a}} powerful, financially formidable organisation supported by Queen Victoria. Meanwhile, Rhodes sent a number of letters to Rudd, warning him that Maund was his main rival, and that because the London syndicate's goals overlapped so closely with their own, it was essential that Cawston and Gifford be defeated or else brought into the Rhodes camp. Regarding Lobengula, Rhodes advised Rudd to make the king think that the concession would work for him. [...] "Offer a steamboat on the Zambezi same as [...] Stanley put on the Upper Congo... Stick to Home Rule and Matabeleland for the Matabele I am sure it is the ticket." ...|$|E
500|$|Not {{knowing when}} his next billed episode would be, Nimoy {{said in an}} {{interview}} before [...] "Momentum Deferred" [...] aired that he's [...] "waiting to see what these terribly imaginative writers come up with for the future. I’m expecting that I probably will be going back to work for them <b>before</b> <b>too</b> much longer. I'm looking forward to what they send me on the page". After shooting the episode, Pinkner said [...] "We want him back as much as he wants to come back". Nimoy's next appearance occurred six episodes later, in [...] "Grey Matters". As a reference to a brief appearance by Nimoy's character William Bell, sound editor Bruce Tanis was instructed to create bells as a recurring motif in the scene when Bell encounters Olivia and gives her vital information about the parallel universe. Tanis explained that because he couldn't put the sound of bells in everything, he [...] "took some dry ice recordings and pitched them down considerably and reverbed them to become ringing tones that I played underneath the whole scene". Tanis also used some [...] "reversed" [...] ship's bells as well as crystal glass rubs in order to make Bell's office sound like multiple layers of glass and bell sounds; he referred to the scene as [...] "a little ominous" [...] but not [...] "too cliche".|$|E

500|$|As the Commissioners did not {{complete}} their task of drawing up statutes <b>before</b> <b>too</b> {{many of them had}} died to permit the remainder to act, a second charter, dated 7 July 1589, was obtained by the then Principal, Francis Bevans. [...] Elizabeth appointed thirteen Commissioners, any three of whom could approve the statutes, and also confirmed Bevans as Principal. Thereafter Griffith Powell, a former student of the college who had been elected to a fellowship in 1589, drafted some statutes and attempted to have them confirmed by the new Commissioners. However, neither Bevans nor his successor John Williams pressed for statutes to be confirmed. [...] In their absence, the Principal had an autocratic position. Powell's view was that successive Principals were [...] "loath to have any statutes at all", since their power would be [...] "limited" [...] by them. Bevans took Powell's draft to his residence in Hereford, where he stayed for several years and lost the copy. In 1595, Powell took another copy to John Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury and chief Commissioner, who rebuked Bevans for not attempting to obtain statutes. [...] Whitgift passed the draft to two other Commissioners in turn, Gabriel Goodman, the Dean of Westminster, and Herbert Westphaling, Bishop of Hereford. [...] Westphaling signed the draft in June 1601. [...] With two more signatures still being required, the statutes were sent to John Herbert in 1602. However, Williams took the draft statutes away before Herbert approved them, and kept them in his study until 1609 without making further attempts to have them confirmed.|$|E

2500|$|Moore {{remained}} captain {{only for}} one round trip to China, taking 117 {{days for the}} return trip. This was 14 days longer than Thermopylae and 27 days longer than achieved by the iron ship Hallowe'en a few months later. Captain W. E. Tiptaft assumed command in 1873 achieving 118 days on his first return trip, but after the ship had to travel 600 miles up the Yangtze River {{in search of a}} cargo. Steamships were now taking most of the tea. The following year the return journey took 122 days, but on the outward journey Cutty Sark set a record time of 73 days from London to Sydney. In November 1877 the ship was anchored off Deal in the English Channel along with sixty other vessels, waiting out a great storm. The anchor failed to hold and Cutty Sark was blown through the ships, damaging two others before grounding [...] on a mud bank. Fortunately she was pulled clear by the tug Macgregor <b>before</b> <b>too</b> much damage was caused and she was towed to the Thames for repairs.|$|E

Max reveals that Mme Fisher believes her daughter is not good enough for him, but according to Max, Naomi is an acceptable match, simply because she is [...] "like the furniture or the dark", comfortable and reassuring. Ultimately, however, she evokes no passion in him. Likewise, Karen confides that she does not wish to marry Ray. They part, but meet again on Folkestone pier the following Saturday, spending the remainder of the day and evening in a hotel room. Karen awakens in the middle of the night and while examining her and Max's shared circumstances, she develops a type of unconscious awareness of Leopold, despite having no clear evidence he will eventually exist, suggested by the author in second person: [...] "All the same, the idea of you, Leopold, began to be present with her." ...|$|E
