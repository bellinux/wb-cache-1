40|$|We present {{two-dimensional}} filter <b>banks</b> <b>with</b> directional vanishing moments. The directional-vanishing-moment {{condition is}} crucial for the regularity of directional filter banks. However, it is a challenging task to design orthogonal filter <b>banks</b> <b>with</b> directional vanishing moments. Due {{to the lack of}} multidimensional factorization theorems, traditional one-dimensional methods cannot be extended to higher dimensional cases. Kovačević and Vetterli investigated the design of two-dimensional orthogonal filter banks and proposed a set of closed-form solutions called the lattice structure, where the polyphase matrix of the filter <b>bank</b> is characterized <b>with</b> a set of rotation parameters. Orthogonal filter <b>banks</b> <b>with</b> lattice structures have simple implementation. We propose a method of designing orthogonal filter <b>banks</b> <b>with</b> directional vanishing moments based on this lattice structure. The constraint of directional vanishing moments is imposed on the rotation parameters. We find the solutions of rotation parameters have special structure. Based on this structure, we find the closed-form solution for orthogonal filter <b>banks</b> <b>with</b> directional vanishing moments...|$|R

40|$|This Master's thesis {{investigates the}} {{different}} impact on bank lending in China from <b>banks</b> <b>with</b> different ownership {{during the recent}} financial crisis in 2008 to 2009. This paper finds that foreign banks in China were generally lending less comparing to <b>banks</b> <b>with</b> joint ownership in non-crisis years, {{but they did not}} completely contract their credit supply when the recent financial crisis struck. Government banks were quite supportive during the financial crisis by increasing lending in corporate loans and in construction industry specifically. On the other hand, domestic private banks were the most supportive in the crisis as they have increased their credit supply significantly throughout the 2008 to 2009 financial crisis. This paper also studies how banks' financial performance affected the bank lending in China during the 2008 to 2009 financial crisis. <b>Banks</b> <b>with</b> considerable assets were more supportive in the latter year of the financial crisis and <b>banks</b> <b>with</b> high capitalization were generally lending more in real estate, construction and manufacture industries in 2008 but less in corporate loans in 2009. <b>Banks</b> <b>with</b> high profitability changed their lending strategy during the financial crisis by curtailing lending in corporate loans as well as construction industry. In addition, <b>banks</b> <b>with</b> high solvency became stricter and more careful with their lending and <b>banks</b> <b>with</b> sufficient funding also became more selective in the credit supply in the second year of the recent financial crisis...|$|R

Costs, mostly for running of the toll plaza, were NOK7.6 million, in addition to financial costs of NOK20.0 million.

Because the debt had been financed with bonds, the company chose to place revenue in the <b>bank</b> <b>with</b> a higher interest instead of paying off the bonds faster. The preferred shares were repaid in 1980, while all bonds had been repaid by 1985. A/S Sotrabrua was formally liquidated on 9 February 1989.|$|E

5|$|Baccarat is a {{game for}} up to 20 players, {{together}} with a banker and croupier; several packs of cards are used, depending {{on the number of}} players. The value of the ace to nine cards are as their pip value, while tens and court cards count as zero. A player is dealt two cards and adds up the combined pips, discounting 10's and court cards, and only using the single digit value as a score - a King and a 6 will equal 16, but their value will be 6; two 8s will equal 16, and their value will also be 6. Two court cards will count as zero, or baccarat. The idea of the game is to get 9 points. A player may ask for one extra card to be added to their hand.
