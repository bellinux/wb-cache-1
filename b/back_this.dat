5|$|A {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the speed of}} light is to measure the time needed for light to travel to a mirror at a known distance and <b>back.</b> <b>This</b> is the working principle behind the Fizeau–Foucault apparatus developed by Hippolyte Fizeau and Léon Foucault.|$|E
5|$|The {{height of}} horses is usually {{measured}} at the highest point of the withers, where the neck meets the <b>back.</b> <b>This</b> point is used {{because it is a}} stable point of the anatomy, unlike the head or neck, which move up and down in relation to the body of the horse.|$|E

5|$|A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, {{but it is}} not certain that this reference is to the grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in Alsace under the spelling Rissling. In Wachau in Austria, there is a small stream and a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, {{there seems to be no}} documentary evidence to <b>back</b> <b>this</b> up, so this claim is not widely believed to be correct.|$|E
5|$|All of the Lancasters had {{completed}} their attacks by 11:07am GMT, and the 21 bombers began the return journey to Yagodnik. The Force A aircraft {{which had not}} been able to bomb brought their Tallboys <b>back.</b> <b>This</b> flight proved uneventful, and all 27 Lancasters landed at Yagodnik in the evening. The Film Unit aircraft flew directly from Kaafjord to the United Kingdom, and arrived at its home station after a fifteen-and-a-half hour flight; this was the longest operational Lancaster mission of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of {{the work}} survive, having been quoted by Lactantius, and Jerome makes note {{of the work}} in a consolatory letter to Heliodorus of Altino. A popular piece of writing until its loss, the Consolatio is widely {{accepted}} as the distinct work that transmitted the earlier consolatio literary tradition to the Romans of the late Republic. In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio claimed to have discovered a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio, although most scholars now agree that this work was either a fraud or a hoax, with modern stylometric methods seeming to <b>back</b> <b>this</b> up.|$|E

5|$|Pursuit-deterrent {{signals are}} {{behavioral}} signals used by prey that convince predators {{not to pursue}} them. For example, gazelles stot, jumping high with stiff legs and an arched <b>back.</b> <b>This</b> is thought to signal to predators {{that they have a}} high level of fitness and can outrun the predator. As a result, predators may choose to pursue a different prey that is less likely to outrun them.|$|E
5|$|The Mask of Zorro was {{initially}} set for release on December 19, 1997 before the release date {{was changed to}} March 1998. There was speculation within the media about whether TriStar changed the date {{in an attempt to}} avoid competition with Titanic. In reality Zorro had encountered production problems that extended its shooting schedule. In addition, Sony Pictures Entertainment, TriStar's parent company, wanted an action film for its first quarter releases of 1998. The release date was once again pushed <b>back,</b> <b>this</b> time to July 1998, when pick-ups were commissioned. The delay from March to July added $3 million in interest costs.|$|E
5|$|As several squads {{left the}} hill on a patrol, North Koreans {{attacked}} the main company position behind it. The platoon dropped {{down off the}} ridge into a gully on the left. Some {{of the men in}} the advanced squad made their way back to US lines, but North Koreans captured most near the bottom of Ka-san on September 10 as they were trying to make their way through the North Korean lines. About 30 minutes after D Company had reached Hill 755, an estimated North Korean battalion launched an attack down the slope running south to Hill 755 from the crest of Hill 902. The company to turned <b>back</b> <b>this</b> attack. That night, North Korean mortar and small arms fire harassed the company and there were several small probing North Korean attacks.|$|E

5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside {{down from their}} feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way that}} allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the <b>back.</b> <b>This</b> difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, Anthony Camp {{challenges}} {{the belief that}} Sophia had a child and provides a detailed summary of the available evidence. In his book Royal Babylon: the Alarming History of European Royalty, author Karl Shaw writes {{of the possibility that}} the Duke raped his sister, citing evidence from Charles Greville's diaries, as well as other factors. Historian Gillian Gill believes that Sophia secretly gave birth to the child and that this is the reason Sophia never married. Alison Weir and others, however, write of a possible marriage between Sophia and Garth the same year as the child's birth, but {{there is no evidence to}} <b>back</b> <b>this</b> assertion other than the presence of a wedding ring in a portrait of an aged Sophia.|$|E
5|$|Cordyline australis is a light-demanding pioneer species, and {{seedlings}} die when overtopped {{by other}} trees. To grow well, young plants require open space {{so they are}} not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes unless there are wet depressions present, and from hillsides {{unless there is a}} seepage area. The fertility of the soil is another factor—settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the fertility of the soil when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut <b>back.</b> <b>This</b> is why C.australis is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.|$|E

5|$|Darling had {{a strong}} {{personality}} and an independent outlook. Those who knew him well thought him destined {{to be a leader}} in whatever he undertook. He shunned strong drink and tobacco and found it difficult to tolerate overindulgence in alcohol. Normally even-tempered, he did show displeasure at the heckling from the crowd at Lord's at his obstinate defensive effort {{in the face of an}} Australian batting collapse. He was a stickler for fair play, but his actions against the English batsman KS Ranjitsinhji would today be seen as gamesmanship. During the bowler's approach and after the bowler had looked at the field, the Australian fielders moved behind Ranjitsinhji's <b>back.</b> <b>This</b> worried the Indian prince when playing his leg glance and eventually saw him left out of the English team.|$|E
5|$|On 14 October 1952, IX Corps {{launched}} an offensive, Operation Showdown, intended {{to improve its}} defensive lines by capturing a complex of hills and force Chinese lines <b>back.</b> <b>This</b> complex included Pike's Peak, Jane Russell Hill, Sandy Hill, and Triangle Hill, northeast of Kumhwa. The 7th Infantry Division advanced, encountering resistance from the 15th Chinese Field Army. In the ensuing Battle of Triangle Hill, the four hills were captured and recaptured by both sides {{several times in the}} heaviest fighting that year. Eventually, the UN forces withdrew having been unsuccessful in capturing their objectives. UN forces suffered 9,000 killed and the Chinese suffered 19,000 killed or wounded during the fighting. The result of the battle had only been a slight improvement in IX Corps' positions, as Chinese positions had been too well fortified for the UN forces to take and hold the ground. For the remainder of the year, US and Chinese forces both conducted a series of smaller raids on each other's lines, avoiding major conflicts, as armistice negotiations continued unsuccessfully. In November, the Chinese {{launched an}}other offensive to retake ground lost during these operations, which was again repulsed by UN forces.|$|E
5|$|The Arabs {{prepared}} a massive strike for 737, however, intended {{to end the}} war for good. Marwan apparently went to Damascus in person to persuade Hisham to <b>back</b> <b>this</b> project and was successful: an army 120,000 strong was assembled, comprising regular forces of Syria and the Jazira, as well as volunteers for the jihad, Armenian troops under Ashot Bagratuni, and even armed camp followers and servants. The number is clearly an exaggeration, but whatever the real size of Marwan's army, it was a huge force and certainly the largest ever sent against the Khazars. Marwan first secured his rear by subduing the Armenian factions who were hostile to the Arabs and their client Ashot. He then pushed into Iberia, driving its Chosroid ruler to seek refuge in the fortress of Anakopia on the Black Sea coast, in the Byzantine protectorate of Abkhazia. Marwan laid siege to Anakopia itself, but he was forced to retire due to the outbreak of dysentery among his troops.|$|E

5|$|The French right, left, and centre had all now failed. The last {{cohesive}} French force {{consisted of}} two battalions of the Old Guard stationed around La Belle Alliance; they had been so placed {{to act as a}} final reserve and to protect Napoleon {{in the event of a}} French retreat. He hoped to rally the French army behind them, but as retreat turned into rout, they too were forced to withdraw, one on either side of La Belle Alliance, in square as protection against Coalition cavalry. Until persuaded that the battle was lost and he should leave, Napoleon commanded the square to the left of the inn. Adam's Brigade charged and forced <b>back</b> <b>this</b> square, while the Prussians engaged the other.|$|E
5|$|The {{climax of}} the Battle of Tannenberg Line was the Soviet attack of 29 July. The shock units {{suppressed}} the German resistance on the Orphanage Hill, while the Soviet main forces suffered heavy casualties in the subsequent assault at the Grenadier Hill. The Soviet tanks encircled it and the Tower Hill, the westernmost one. Steiner, {{the commander of the}} III SS Panzer Corps, sent out the remaining seven tanks, which hit the surprised Soviet armour and forced them <b>back.</b> <b>This</b> enabled an improvised battle group led by Hauptsturmführer Paul Maitla to launch a counterattack which recaptured the Grenadier Hill. Of the 136,830 Soviets initiating the offensive on 25 July, a few thousand had remained fit for combat by 1 August. The Soviet tank regiments had been demolished.|$|E
5|$|The device {{incorporates}} a 1.7GHz quad-core Snapdragon 600, an ARMv7 SoC, with 2GB of RAM. The chip provides support for LTE networks {{where they are}} available. Most HTC One models come with either 32 or 64 GB of internal, non-expandable storage—unlike the international model, the Chinese and Japanese models include a microSD slot and a removable back cover. Its internal components are arranged in a pyramid-like layout similar to the HTC Butterfly and HTC Windows Phone 8X with larger components (such as the screen and battery) positioned towards the front and smaller components (such as the motherboard) positioned towards the <b>back.</b> <b>This</b> internal layout also allows the device to have a curved backing.|$|E
