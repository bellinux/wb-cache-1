5|$|Avoiding {{stereotypes}} and labeling <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>personal</b> dress, the program uses polo shirts, t-shirts, and other articles of clothing like neckerchiefs as uniforms. Participants uniforms display the White Stag logo, {{which is a}} visible reminder of the program's founding vision articulated by Baden-Powell {{at the conclusion of}} the 1933 World Jamboree. The uniform reminds the individual wearing it of their commitment to the program's values. It instills self-esteem in the person and pride in the program. It eliminates class and socio-economic distinctions. Wearing a uniform improves member's behavior and lessens the impact on a person's personal wardrobe.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} hostility of Bede has {{obscured}} Penda's importance as ruler who wielded an imperium {{similar to that of}} other prominent 7th century 'overkings'. Penda's hegemony included lesser rulers of both Anglo-Saxon and British origins, non-Christian and Christian alike. The relationships between Penda, as hegemon, and his subordinate rulers would have been <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>personal</b> as well as political ties, and they would often have been reinforced by dynastic marriages. It has been asserted that Penda's court would have been cosmopolitan, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual and tolerant. Though a pagan himself, there is evidence that the contemporary Mercian elite contained significant Christian and British elements. Penda must have been intimate with many Britons and may have been bilingual himself.|$|E

25|$|Through most {{of human}} history {{societies}} have been <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>personal</b> relations: individuals in groups know each other and exchange favors. Today in most lower-income societies hierarchies of groups distribute wealth <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>personal</b> relationships among group leaders, a process often linked with clientelism and corruption. Michael Mousseau argues that {{in this kind of}} socio-economy conflict is always present, latent or overt, because individuals depend on their groups for physical and economic security and are thus loyal to their groups rather than their states, and because groups are {{in a constant state of}} conflict over access to state coffers. Through processes of bounded rationality, people are conditioned towards strong in-group identities and are easily swayed to fear outsiders, psychological predispositions that make possible sectarian violence, genocide, and terrorism.|$|E
25|$|Sexual Behavior in the Human Female was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>personal</b> {{interviews}} with approximately 6,000 women.

Comparisons are made of female and male sexual activities. Kinsey's evidence suggested that women were less sexually active than men.|$|E

It may be practiced individually, within a family, socially, or in public. Additionally, there is also militant naturism, including campaigning, and extreme naturism is sometimes considered a separate category.|$|E

25|$|Most current {{scholarship}} {{is of the}} opinion that such long-distance alliances cannot have existed in the 8th century BC.

The German historian Detlev Fehling believes that the entire Lelantine War is an invention of later centuries, produced by a chain of Pseudo-Nachrichten (pseudo-reports). This opinion has been generally rejected.|$|E
25|$|A central {{feature of}} Buddhist {{psychology}} is its methodology, which is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>personal</b> experience through introspection and phenomenological self observation. According to the Buddha while initially unreliable, one's mind can be trained, calmed and cultivated {{so as to}} make introspection a refined and reliable method. This methodology is the foundation for the personal insight into the nature of the mind the Buddha is said to have achieved. While introspection is a key aspect of the Buddhist method, observation of a person's behavior is also important.|$|E
