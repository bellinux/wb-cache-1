5|$|Reenlisted {{prisoners of}} war formed a large section of the {{approximately}} 30,800 former Austria-Hungarian citizens who were registered as active on the Romanian side by late 1917. By the time it stopped recruiting (January 1918), the Corps had enlisted some 8,500 to 10,000 men. However, the Kornilov order came {{too late in the}} war for there to have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> significant Transylvanian-Bukovinan contribution to the Romanian effort.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{questions}} {{over the new}} ships' nomenclature came uncertainty about their actual role due to their lack of protection. If they were primarily to act as scouts for the battle fleet and hunter-killers of enemy cruisers and commerce raiders, then the seven inches of belt armour with {{which they had been}} equipped would be adequate. If, on the other hand, they were expected to reinforce a battle line of dreadnoughts with their own heavy guns, they were too thin-skinned to be safe from an enemy's heavy guns. The Invincibles were essentially extremely large, heavily armed, fast armoured cruisers. However, the viability of the armoured cruiser was already in doubt. A cruiser that could have worked with the Fleet might have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> viable option for taking over that role.|$|E
5|$|Tourism has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> {{successful}} {{industry in}} the area. For over two hundred years visitors have been drawn by the lake and mountain scenery of the Lake District, and many have {{made their way to}} the top of Helvellyn. Among the early visitors to Helvellyn were the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, both of whom lived nearby at one period. Many routes up the mountain are possible so that it may be approached from all directions. The view from the top is one of the most extensive over the Lake District, and on a clear day the view can also stretch from Scotland to Wales.|$|E

5|$|Several factors {{explain the}} {{withdrawal}} of the RAAF's Vengeances from combat. Odgers judged that a key reason behind the decision was the poor performance of the Vengeance compared to other available aircraft in the region. USAAF units equipped with superior types were arriving in New Guinea during early 1944, and Kenney wanted to free up scarce space at forward airfields so that he could launch attacks on the important Japanese bases at Wewak and Hollandia; these targets were beyond the range of the Vengeance. In particular, No. 77 Wing was required to vacate Nadzab so that its airfields could accommodate a group of long-ranged Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighers. Odgers also argued that the Vengeances had proven to be mechanically unreliable, and had difficulty taking off while carrying a full bomb load: in practice it was found that they could carry only the same bomb load as Kittyhawk fighters. The Kittyhawks were also superior at strafing targets and {{did not need to be}} escorted. A 2008 paper written by staff of the RAAF's Air Power Development Centre disputed Odgers' views on the reliability of the aircraft, stating that No. 77 Wing had a good serviceability rate. This paper instead argued that difficulties in supplying the wing may have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> important factor.|$|E

25|$|There is {{considerable}} debate {{about what would}} have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> appropriate term. Some scholars, notably Ruth Ross, argue that mana (prestige, authority) would have more accurately conveyed the transfer of sovereignty. However, it has more recently been argued by others, including Judith Binney, that mana {{would not have been}} appropriate. This is because mana {{is not the same thing}} as sovereignty, and also because no-one can give up their mana.|$|E
25|$|Virgin Money's older logo was {{the word}} 'Virgin' in a red rounded skew rectangle, similar in shape to a credit card, {{followed}} by the word 'Money'. The previous logo had used a red logo with the word 'Virgin' in a large circle and three smaller circles above the word 'Money'.

25|$|York's public stance {{was that}} of a reformer, {{demanding}} better government and the prosecution of the traitors who had lost northern France. Judging by his later actions, there may also have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> hidden motive – the destruction of Somerset, who was soon released from the Tower. Although granted another office, that of Justice of the Forest south of the Trent (14 July 1447), York still lacked any real support outside Parliament and his own retainers.|$|E
25|$|Costas' {{decision}} to be positive rather than negative has been viewed by some in both political parties as a weakness, a lack of the killer instinct. Some have said that Costas is too nice to be a politician. Some have charged {{that it was a}} political mistake not to go after the mayor (Butterfield) on the Pratt deal when Costas had the chance. Maybe. We'll never know if Costas might have won if he had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> typical political campaigner.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} {{literary}} work in Tamil to heap criticism on Brahmins was the Tirumanthiram, a treatise on Yoga from the 13th century. However, anti-Brahminism has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> recent phenomenon {{and has been}} {{partly due to the}} efforts of Christian missionaries of the 19th century. The writings and speeches of Iyothee Thass, Maraimalai Adigal, Periyar, Bharatidasan, C. N. Annadurai and the leaders of Justice Party in the early 20th century and of the Dravidar Kazhagam in more modern times constitute much of modern anti-Brahmin rhetoric.|$|E

25|$|Bismarck {{maintained}} {{good relations}} with Italy, although he had a personal dislike for Italians and their country. He {{can be seen as}} a marginal contributor to Italian unification. Politics surrounding the 1866 Austro-Prussian War allowed Italy to annex Venetia, which had been a kronland ("crown land") of the Austrian Empire since the 1815 Congress of Vienna. In addition, French mobilization for the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871 made it necessary for Napoleon III to withdraw his troops from Rome and The Papal States. Without these two events, Italian unification would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> prolonged process.|$|E
25|$|Another {{consequence}} of increased enrollment has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> unbalanced {{composition of the}} residences. Traditionally, students from all years of study have lived in residence, but increasingly, very few upper year students continue to live on campus, thus making way for more first years. In 2006, Alexandra Hall, traditionally the all-women's residence, was made co-ed {{for the first time}} with rooms in the basement alternating between male and female occupants as well as one wing of the first floor becoming all-male. In addition, two of the five bays were re-converted to co-ed living spaces in 2006.|$|E

She also had been prepared to tackle quite dramatic parts in operas like L'Africaine, Les Huguenots and even Aida. She never attempted to sing any verismo parts, however, because these became popular only in the twilight of her career, during the final decade of the 19th century.|$|E
