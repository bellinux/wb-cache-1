5|$|Veteran West Virginia Senator Harley M. Kilgore {{offered to}} {{exchange}} seats with Barkley, putting Barkley {{on the front}} row with the chamber's senior members and himself on the <b>back</b> <b>row</b> with the freshman legislators, but Barkley declined the offer. In honor of his previous service, {{he was assigned to}} the prestigious Committee on Foreign Relations. In this position, he endorsed Eisenhower's appointment of Cooper as U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal. His relative lack of seniority did not afford him much influence.|$|E
5|$|Wavell Wakefield {{represented}} England in 31 Tests between 1920 and 1927, including 13 Tests as captain. He {{was involved}} in three Five Nations Grand Slams in 1921, 1923 and 1924. Playing as flanker, Wakefield introduced new elements to <b>back</b> <b>row</b> tactics which beforehand concentrated on the set piece. He became a Member of Parliament in 1935, and was knighted in 1944. He became the RFU President in 1950 and following his retirement from politics was awarded the title the first Baron Wakefield of Kendal.|$|E
5|$|Minton {{took his}} Senate seat in January 1935. As a {{freshman}}, {{he sat in}} the <b>back</b> <b>row</b> of the chamber next to fellow freshman Harry Truman, and the pair quickly became friends. Minton was made a member of a special Lobby Investigation Committee chaired by Senator Hugo Black, that was set up to look into questionable lobbyist groups. According to professor of political science Linda C. Gugin, a Minton biographer, in practice the committee's investigations were politically motivated and directed against groups that were challenging New Deal legislation.|$|E

5|$|Sowakula {{arrived in}} New Zealand from Fiji {{at the end}} of 2016 after his agent promised a deal with Taranaki Rugby to place him in the union's academy. Originally a winger, he {{converted}} to the <b>back</b> <b>row</b> and represented the sides development team as they went through their representative season unbeaten, winning the northern regions competition in the process. After a stand-out year and one of the club players of the year in 2017 for Spotswood United, Sowakula earnt his call-up into Taranaki's Mitre 10 Cup side for their 2017 seasons campaign. He made his debut for the province, making the match-day fifthteen at blinside flanker against Waikato.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} the {{starting}} grid, Carlos Sainz Jr. stopped on track and had to be pushed back to pit lane, where he eventually started, only to retire after just a few hundred metres. At the start, both Mercedes drivers got away well and Hamilton tried to overtake Rosberg for the lead around the outside of the first corner, but were unable to do so. Jenson Button made a good start, moving from 16th to 13th, while Marcus Ericsson fell from 13th to 18th. Behind the leaders, the Ferrari drivers retained third and fourth place respectively. Bottas moved into fifth after moving around the outside. Hamilton was able to follow Rosberg closely in the opening laps, while Daniel Ricciardo was the first driver to pit for new tyres on lap four. One lap later, Grosjean was able to use drag reduction system (DRS) to overtake Felipe Nasr for eleventh. With his <b>back</b> <b>row</b> start and an early pit stop, Ricciardo overtook the two Manor Marussia cars around lap nine.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural Monaco Grand Prix {{was held}} on 14 April 1929. Caracciola, driving a 7.1-litre Mercedes-Benz SSK, started from the <b>back</b> <b>row</b> of the grid (which was {{allocated}} randomly), and battled Bugatti driver William Grover-Williams for the lead early on. However, his pit stop, which took {{four and a half}} minutes to refill his car with petrol, left him unable to recover the time, and he eventually finished third. He won the RAC Tourist Trophy in slippery conditions, and confirmed his reputation as a specialist in wet track racing. He partnered Werner in the Mille Miglia and Le Mans endurance races in 1930; they finished sixth in the former but were forced to retire after leading for most of the race in the latter after their car's generator burnt out. Caracciola took victory in the 1930 Irish Grand Prix at Phoenix Park, and won four hillclimbs to take the title of European Hillclimb Champion for the first time. However, he was forced to close his dealership in Berlin after the firm went bankrupt.|$|E

5|$|The top ten drivers {{competed for}} pole {{position}} in Q3 {{and it was}} a battle between the two Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton set his fastest time first with Rosberg right behind him. A much better time in the third sector of the track allowed Rosberg to take his sixth consecutive pole position almost four-tenths ahead of his teammate. Sergio Pérez held third spot for much of the session but was beaten to it by Kimi Räikkönen during the second turn of runs. The two were followed by Daniel Ricciardo and Valtteri Bottas on the third row of the grid. Following a gearbox change after qualifying, Romain Grosjean was demoted five places on the grid. Roberto Merhi and Will Stevens also received five place penalties: Stevens for a change of the Control Electronics unit, Merhi for changes made to his suspension. Both would start the race from the <b>back</b> <b>row</b> of the grid.|$|E
5|$|Culver first {{appeared}} as Casey Donovan in Boys in the Sand, directed by Wakefield Poole, in 1971. The film {{was an instant}} success and {{is considered one of}} the great classics of male erotic cinema. With the success and celebrity he garnered from the film, Donovan believed that he would be able to cross over into mainstream film. While there were meetings with directors like John Schlesinger and Raymond St. Jacques and talk of casting him in mainstream projects including adaptations of novels by Mary Renault and Patricia Nell Warren, the only film opportunities opened for him were as the star of more erotic films. These included the bisexual porn film Score, The <b>Back</b> <b>Row</b> with George Payne, L. A. Tool & Die with Bob Blount and Richard Locke, The Other Side of Aspen with Al Parker and Dick Fisk, Boys in the Sand II and Inevitable Love, with Jon King and Jamie Wingo. Shortly before his death he starred, heavily intoxicated, in the fisting movie Fucked Up, for Christopher Rage. He also appeared in a number of heterosexual porn films, most notably The Opening of Misty Beethoven where he had a scene with Constance Money.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} {{consecutive}} race, the fastest driver in qualifying did not start the race from pole. Michael Schumacher set the fastest time, but a five-place grid penalty left him sixth overall. Two hours before the race, protests against parts introduced onto {{the floor of the}} Red Bull RB8 left team principal Christian Horner with a choice: to change the offending parts and start both cars from the pit lane, guaranteeing that any result the team recorded would be preserved; or to leave the parts on the car, allowing both drivers to start the race from the positions they qualified in, but risking a post-race exclusion. Horner ultimately chose the latter option, and Mark Webber started from pole, establishing an early lead over Nico Rosberg as a first-corner accident eliminated four cars. The race was run under the constant threat of rain, with drivers trying to extend the life of their tyres to avoid being forced to make an additional stop and falling down the order. The rain never materialised, though Jean-Éric Vergne was observed using a set of intermediate tyres late in the race. The variety of strategies used by the front-runners resulted in the last ten laps being contested with the top six cars running nose-to-tail. Webber visibly faded in the final laps, but held on when the following cars were momentarily pinned behind the slow-moving Heikki Kovalainen. Webber won the race – his second on the streets of Monaco – with Rosberg second and Fernando Alonso third, the result giving Alonso a three-point lead in the championship. Red Bull Racing maintained their lead in the Constructors' Championship as rival teams chose not to follow through on the threat of their pre-race protest, while Kovalainen finished thirteenth to see Caterham overtake Marussia for tenth place. Elsewhere, Spanish Grand Prix winner Pastor Maldonado was given a ten-place grid penalty for an incident that saw him clip Sergio Pérez. Combined with a five-place penalty for changing his gearbox, Maldonado started from the <b>back</b> <b>row</b> of the grid where he was eliminated in the first-corner accident.|$|E

25|$|Klien {{returned}} to drive Senna's {{car in the}} first session of Friday free practice for the European Grand Prix. The regular drivers again shared the <b>back</b> <b>row</b> of the grid after qualifying, with Chandhok ahead of Senna. The following day, Chandhok again finished in 18th place, with Senna two places behind after making an unscheduled pit stop for a new front wing, after losing his original part in a collision with Timo Glock's Virgin as the pair were being lapped. At the British Grand Prix, Yamamoto was promoted to the race team in favour of Senna. The drivers again qualified on the <b>back</b> <b>row,</b> with Chandhok ahead, and achieved another double finish in the same order, despite Chandhok sustaining aerodynamic damage to his car from debris. For the German Grand Prix, Senna reclaimed his seat, whilst Yamamoto moved across to the #20 car to replace Chandhok. Yamamoto qualified in 23rdposition, ahead of Di Grassi, who did not set a time due to a gearbox problem, whilst Senna set the 21st-quickest time, ahead of Vitantonio Liuzzi (Force India), who crashed during the session. Both drivers were then moved up an additional place on the grid when Glock was penalised for an unscheduled gearbox change. After racing with the other new teams, Senna was delayed by a slow puncture and finished in 19thplace, and Yamamoto retired on lap19 when his engine cut out. At the Hungarian Grand Prix, the drivers qualified on the <b>back</b> <b>row</b> of the grid. Senna, who qualified ahead, was then elevated to 22ndposition when Kamui Kobayashi (Sauber) was given a penalty for failing {{to stop at the}} pit-lane weighbridge when requested. Yamamoto, along with four other drivers, was given a reprimand for failing to achieve the maximum permitted lap time throughout the qualifying session. In the race, the two cars sandwiched Di Grassi at the finish, with Senna and Yamamoto in 17th and 19thplaces, three and four laps down on the winner respectively.|$|E

25|$|Canopies {{for each}} cardinal-elector were once used during conclaves—a sign of equal dignity. After the new Pope accepts his election, {{he would give}} his new name; at this time, the other Cardinals would tug on a rope {{attached}} to their seats to lower their canopies. Until reforms instituted by Saint Pius X, the canopies were of different colours to designate which Cardinals had been appointed by which Pope. Paul VI abolished the canopies altogether, since, under his papacy, {{the population of the}} College of Cardinals had increased so much {{to the point that they}} would need to be seated in rows of two against the walls, making the canopies obstruct the view of the cardinals in the <b>back</b> <b>row.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} that such a penalty relegated a driver past the <b>back</b> <b>row</b> of the grid, the {{remaining}} penalty carried over to the next race. For example, if a driver qualified in nineteenth position and received a five-place grid penalty, they dropped to twenty-second and last place for that race, and then would receive an additional two-place penalty in the next Grand Prix. These penalties could only be carried over to the next race, rather than accumulate, and only applied to penalties issued for going over the component quota. Penalties cannot be carried over from season to season; when a driver incurred such a penalty during the final race of the season, the stewards {{had the power to}} issue time penalties during the race.|$|E

With the mercurial John Horton and the incisive Mike Beese, the side continued to develop Bath's reputation in the early Seventies with wins over the top Welsh sides. However, the revolution began {{with the arrival of}} coach Jack Rowell in 1978. Rowell transformed the ethos of a club that had traditionally drawn its players from the immediate locality. When formalised competitions started in the 1980s Jack Rowell brought premature professionalism to Bath and began to assemble a side with power and precision. The power, provided by Gareth Chilcott and Roger Spurrell was complemented by the precision of John Horton and winger David Trick.|$|E
