Belldandy appears before Keiichi and offers to grant him a wish. Convinced that the whole incident is a prank played on him by his seniors (Senpais), Keiichi half-jokingly wishes her {{to stay with him}} forever.

She was created by Kōsuke Fujishima as one of three Goddesses who come to Earth to reside with Keiichi Morisato, and she serves as his love interest. She is depicted as a beautiful and powerful young woman, with strong nurturing tendencies, a trusting and innocent character, and an extremely kind heart. Belldandy is accidentally summoned from heaven by Keiichi in order to grant him a wish and stays when Keiichi wishes for [...] "a goddess like you to be <b>by</b> <b>my</b> <b>side</b> forever". The stories follow Belldandy as she builds a relationship with Keiichi, using her powers (which include teleportation, telekinesis, telepathy, and levitation) to help both Keiichi and his friends while keeping her true identity a secret.|$|E

2500|$|As Edvard remembered it, Christian's {{positive}} {{behavior toward}} his children was overshadowed by his morbid pietism. Munch wrote, [...] "My father was temperamentally nervous and obsessively religious—to {{the point of}} psychoneurosis. From him I inherited the seeds of madness. The angels of fear, sorrow, and death stood <b>by</b> <b>my</b> <b>side</b> since the day I was born." [...] Christian reprimanded his children by telling them that their mother was looking down from heaven and grieving over their misbehavior. The oppressive religious milieu, Edvard's poor health, and the vivid ghost stories helped inspire his macabre visions and nightmares; the boy felt that death was constantly advancing on him. One of Munch's younger sisters, Laura, was diagnosed with mental illness at an early age. Of the five siblings, only Andreas married, but he died {{a few months after}} the wedding. Munch would later write, [...] "I inherited two of mankind's most frightful enemies—the heritage of consumption and insanity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rumors {{began to}} {{circulate}} {{alleging that the}} Buccaneers were a disorganized and confused organization, and returning veterans were promised that changes were forthcoming. It was pointed out {{that none of the}} team's administrative staff had any experience in their position, {{at the same time that}} a team of rookie players and coaches was being fielded. These problems were addressed with the firings and resignations of six coaches and administrators at the beginning of the year. Head coach John McKay used the opportunity to take control of more aspects of the organization, and selected replacements of his choosing. McKay was criticized over his handling of the players, and was accused of cutting veterans who could have helped the team, such as Ira Gordon, over ego conflicts. A perception arose that McKay was intolerant toward challenges to his authority, as he frequently cut players who argued with him, and surrounded himself with former USC players and staff. Concern that McKay preferred players who would keep their mouth shut, rather than players with talent, produced resentment among veterans who worried that their limited career spans would be spent with a losing team. Critics accused McKay of attempting a style of play that was more appropriate for the college game, and noted Don Shula's comment that preparing for the Buccaneers was like preparing to play USC. Reporters who covered the team indicated that McKay did not respond to the losing streak with the humor that it was hoped he would, but that he became an [...] "old grouch" [...] who complained about his coaching assistants, game-day officiating, and opposing coaches who he accused of running up the score. This was reflected in a bitter tone that had crept into McKay's trademark humor, with comments such as [...] "I keep a picture of O.J. Simpson <b>by</b> <b>my</b> <b>side</b> at all times to remind me of the days when I knew how to coach".|$|E

60|$|I {{walked a}} few yards away and once more looked wildly round. Far away on the dark {{hillside}} I could see the white-robed figures of the lay brethren bending over their labour.

60|$|I saw her lying dead, and {{her face}} was {{beautiful}} and serene. But it was the other room I entered first, and it was <b>by</b> <b>my</b> sister’s <b>side</b> that I fell upon my knees. The rounded completeness of a woman’s life that was my mother’s had not been for her. She would not have it at the price. ‘I’ll never leave you, mother.’—‘Fine I know you’ll never leave me.’ The fierce joy of loving too much, it is a terrible thing. My sister’s mouth was firmly closed, as if she had got her way.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{is derived}} from the hymn [...] "Fully Saved Today" [...] by William J. Henry (words) and Clarence E. Hunter (music), {{published}} in 1911. It is in call-and-response format. The subject-matter is said to be Psalm 96:2, [...] "Sing unto the Lord, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day". The words of the verses of hymn and song differ, but the refrains are similar. This is the refrain of the hymn: I am fully saved today,I am in the narrow way;And no evil can betide,For I’m walking <b>by</b> <b>my</b> Savior’s <b>side.</b>|$|R

60|$|When I {{received}} a letter from Bianca it was a new source of solitary luxury. Her letters, it is true, were less and less frequent, but they were always full of assurances of unabated affection. They breathed not the frank and innocent warmth with which she expressed herself in conversation, but I accounted for it from the embarrassment which inexperienced minds have often to express themselves upon paper. Filippo assured me of her unaltered constancy. They both lamented in the strongest terms our continued separation, though they did justice to the filial feeling that kept me <b>by</b> <b>my</b> father's <b>side.</b>|$|R
6000|$|While {{the good}} woman {{was forced to}} bestir herself for her lodgers' breakfasts, Lucilla could steal a solitary moment to gaze on the pallid face to which death had {{restored}} much of its beauty.

60|$|These {{were not}} {{exactly the kind of}} words best {{calculated}} to give a lad courage, and I realized that by listening to her many seconds I should become cowardly.

All <b>my</b> family <b>by</b> <b>my</b> father’s <b>side</b> had a knack at physic. ‘There was my uncle that was killed at Brandywine—he died as easy again as any other man the regiment, just from knowing how to hold his breath naturally.

Since then I have scarce thought of aught else. They have murdered my grandfather and uncles and one of my aunts; they have shot away my father's leg, and would have taken his life had he not escaped out of their hands; so that what was before a longing is now a fixed idea, and if my father will but give me permission, assuredly I will carry it out.|$|R
