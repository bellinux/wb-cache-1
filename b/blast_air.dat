50|$|During the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries there were 17 watermills along the river: fulling mills for {{preparing}} cloth, mills for grinding corn and malt, and paper mills.

50|$|Ultimately this {{principle}} was applied even more efficiently in regenerative heat exchangers, {{such as the}} Cowper stove (which preheat incoming <b>blast</b> <b>air</b> with waste heat from flue gas; these are used in modern blast furnaces), and in the open hearth furnace (for making steel) by the Siemens-Martin process.|$|E
40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>blast,</b> {{a sudden}} mass {{movement}} of air, {{can occur in}} underground mining system where caving develops an extensive mass of unsupported rock spanning a large void. <b>Air</b> <b>blast</b> can result in injury to mine personnel, damage to equipment or disrupts mine operation. Evaluation of <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> parameters is, therefore, an essential part to develop strategies to mitigate the hazard. The properties of a muckpile or a caved zone are significant factors affecting the magnitude of <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> in particular on the undercut and extraction levels. This research investigates the effect of muckpile properties on air flow using the numerical code, PFC 2 D. The critical parameters such as thickness, block size and porosity (swell factor) of the muckpile have been studied to quantify how much they could change the magnitude of air pressures and velocities while the air flows through the muckpile. It {{was found that the}} porosity of the muckpile is the most effective parameter on the magnitude of <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> and by designing a thick layer of blasted rock with low porosity in the caved zone, the intensity of the <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> can be significantly reduced. The findings of this study can be used to design <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> plugs or bulkheads in order to isolate any potential <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> from the active workings, or to quantify the minimum thickness of the muckpile above extraction levels to manage <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> hazards...|$|R

5000|$|In the 1950s and 60s, {{the term}} [...] "air doctor" [...] {{was first used}} to refer to the {{non-contact}} method of debris blow-off using compressed air. The printing and textile industries were some of the largest users of air doctors at that time. They often needed wide paths of air from a compressed air system to control the thickness of liquids on a surface, or to blow debris off the surface of materials prior to the next process. Other terms used were air bar, air squeegee, air curtain, air jet, air <b>blast,</b> <b>air</b> blow off, air nozzle, air comb, air blade and air doctor blade. Today the most commonly used term is simply [...] "air knife".|$|E
50|$|This {{leads to}} the natural {{conclusion}} that ice particles which change state from solid to liquid at normal working temperatures are ideally suited for cleaning applications where stringent cleanliness is required {{and at the same}} time the use of cleaning chemicals are not desirable. The ice particles provide impact cleaning before the phase change, which then scrubs and flushes away contaminants, which can be easily collected and disposed.Ice particles will melt into water and some of the water will undergo forced evaporation arising from the <b>blast</b> <b>air</b> movement. In warm climates, complete evaporation can take place, leaving only damp blast debris. This aspect of ice blast is of particular interest to those concerned with waste generation and disposal, especially in the cleaning of hazardous chemicals. Waste minimization is also important for the cleaning of industrial spaces where floor drains are not common.|$|E
50|$|In {{this type}} of <b>blasting,</b> <b>air</b> and dry ice are used. Surface {{contaminants}} are dislodged {{by the force of}} frozen carbon dioxide particles hitting at high velocity, and by slight shrinkage due to freezing which disrupts adhesion bonds. The dry ice sublimates, leaving no residue to clean up other than the removed material. Dry ice is a relatively soft material, so is less destructive to the underlying material than sandblasting.|$|R

5000|$|The {{concept of}} the hoverboard—a {{skateboard}} that can float off the ground—has been explored by various groups since {{the release of the}} film. Attempts similar to hoverboats, which <b>blast</b> <b>air</b> at the ground, have been demonstrated, with a 2015 record distance of 275 meters. A different type is the MagBoard, developed by researchers at the Paris Diderot University. It uses a large superconductor plate on the bottom cooled with liquid nitrogen as to achieve the Meissner effect and allow it to float over a special track; it was shown capable of carrying the weight of a human in its practical demonstration. However, the requirement to run the superconductor at higher, more ambient temperatures prevents this from becoming practical. In March 2014, a company named HUVr Tech purportedly demonstrated a working hoverboard along with several celebrities including Lloyd, though this shortly was revealed as a hoax created by the website Funny or Die. self-balancing 'hoverboards' became popular in 2015 even though they do not hover above the ground.|$|E
50|$|When the coke is very hot, solid {{pieces of}} metal are charged into the furnace through {{an opening in the}} top. The metal is alternated with {{additional}} layers of fresh coke. Limestone is added to act as a flux. As the heat rises within the stack the metal is melted. It drips down through the coke bed to collect in a pool at the bottom, just above the bottom doors. During the melting process a thermodynamic reaction takes place between the fuel and the <b>blast</b> <b>air.</b> The carbon in the coke combines with the oxygen in the air to form carbon monoxide. The carbon monoxide further burns to form carbon dioxide. Some of the carbon is picked up by the falling droplets of molten metal which raises the carbon content of the iron. Silicon carbide and ferromanganese briquettes may also be added to the charge materials. The silicon carbide dissociates and carbon and silicon enters into the molten metal. Likewise, the ferromanganese melts and is combined into the pool of liquid iron in the 'well' {{at the bottom of the}} cupola. Additions to the molten iron such as ferromanganese, ferrosilicon, Silicon carbide and other alloying agents are used to alter the molten iron to conform to the needs of the castings at hand.|$|E
5000|$|Anthracite, {{also known}} as stone coal or rock coal, is very {{difficult}} to ignite, mine, clean, and break into smaller chunks and requires correct conditions to build heat or hold temperature and sustain burning - which oft depend upon the size and uniformity of the coal particles. Yet American cities were cramped for fuels, woodlands were exhausted near bigger towns and Philadelphia, largest city in America needed fuels for mills and foundries as well to sustain manufacturing. Inventor and industrialist Josiah White (owner of a wire mill, foundry and nail factory), had determined how to burn anthracite in iron working processing furnaces during the War of 1812, but its use in smelting operations was hit or miss, dependent upon the material packing geometries of any particular charging load in a cold blast furnace. [...] The earlier development of coking of bituminous coal, as well anthracite coke enabled the smelting of iron using local coal sources with cold <b>blast</b> <b>air</b> in blast furnaces after the latter 1830s allowed the production of the vast quantities of iron that built the fundamental infrastructure of the early North American Industrial Revolution [...] - [...] which was built on iron products and only some steel. At the time, iron was used minimally with respect to wood. Even most railroad tracks were laid with wooden rails, sometimes covered by iron strapping. As more iron became available, more uses were found for iron, creating a cycle of increasing demand, experimentation and improvements - [...] part of the revolution in industrial revolution.|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{computer program}} using FORTRAN language {{was developed to}} model the mass and heat balance {{of the process of}} continuous converting of copper matte {{in order to determine the}} effect of oxygen enrichment in the <b>blast</b> <b>air</b> on process efficiency. The program integrates all parameters involved in the continuous converting of copper matte. It applies fundamental thermodynamics as well as empirical and semi-empirical expressions to predict process outcomes as a function of varying input parameters. These parameters include the tonnages, composition, temperature and enthalpies of <b>blast</b> <b>air,</b> liquid matte, solid matte, reverts, flux and scrap. Predicted process outcomes include the quantities, composition, temperature and heat content of semi-blister, white metal, slag and off-gas. The computer program predicts that using oxygen enriched air enhances process efficiency dramatically. With higher oxygen levels in the blast, higher converting temperatures can be achieved, and hence, allowing the usage of more feed materials (scrap, reverts, etc.). Also, by increasing the oxygen level in the <b>blast</b> <b>air</b> to 30 vol. %, the concentration of sulfur dioxide in the off-gas can be increased by about 45 vol. %. The copper content in the slag was found to be lower when converting at higher temperatures. 2. Keywords: converting, process, copper, modeling...|$|E

2500|$|The Lowe {{process is}} {{performed}} {{in a series of}} three chambers, the generator, the carburettor and the superheater. [...] The original <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> is used to produce air gas in the generator. [...] The heat of primary combustion heats the coal sufficiently, while the air gas is burned by a second <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> in the other two chambers in which the oil for carburetting is decomposed. These chambers contain a quantity of loose fire brick called “checker work,” and the air gas is burned in them during the time the <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> is on the main producer. When the coal and checker work are hot enough, the <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> is shut off and the steam blast is turned on. Heat stored in the checker work pyrolyzes the mixture of water gas and oil, which is led through the chambers while the steam blast is on the producers. The Lowe process is endothermic, and cools the generator and checker work, so the process has to alternate between <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> for heating and steam blast for gas production.|$|R
