5|$|In the 1850s, European-Americans {{settled in}} the area that is now Omak and built houses and inaugurated mining, logging and {{agricultural}} activities. As more white settlers arrived, a dispute about land ownership arose <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Native Americans.|$|E

According to the Shoku Nihongi, an imperially commissioned record of Japanese history completed in 797, Emperor Kanmu who ruled from 781 to 806 {{was the son of}} a Korean concubine, Takano no Niigasa, who was descended from King Muryeong of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.|$|E
5|$|By May 1947, {{authorities}} in Vojvodina {{noted that there}} was a dispute <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{authorities in}} Croatia regarding the interpretation of the position of the border along the Danube, and that the federal authorities, who were asked to mediate in the dispute, supported the position of Croatia. At the same time, Vojvodina requested that Croatia return the territories on the right bank of the Danube that had previously been ceded to it (Varoš-Viza and Mala Siga). While in the Yugoslav framework, the issue received little further attention as its resolution was discouraged by the federal authorities, and because the area involved had limited economic value, was uninhabited and frequently flooded.|$|E

5|$|Gaza's Jewish {{community}} was roughly 3,000 years old, and in 1481 there were sixty Jewish households. Most of them fled from Gaza after the 1929 Palestine riots, when they consisted of fifty families. In Sami Hadawi's land and population survey, Gaza had {{a population of}} 34,250, including 80 Jews in 1945. Most of them left the city after the 1948 War, due to mutual distrust <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Arab majority. Today, there are no Jews living in Gaza.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Sinatra {{worked with}} Quincy Jones {{for the first}} time in nearly two decades on the album, L.A. Is My Lady, which was well {{received}} critically. The album was a substitute for another Jones project, an album of duets with Lena Horne, which had to be abandoned. In 1986, Sinatra collapsed on stage while performing in Atlantic City and was hospitalized for diverticulitis, which left him looking frail. Two years later, Sinatra reunited with Martin and Davis, Jr. and went on the Rat Pack Reunion Tour, during which they played a number of large arenas. When Martin dropped out of the tour early on, a rift developed <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two never spoke again.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{at about}} 11:00 am, 16 tanks, 2 armored {{personnel}} carriers and 30 cars had been sent from the Officer School of Armored and Mechanized Formations, a Poznań garrison, to protect the designated buildings, but no shots were exchanged <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> insurgents. These soldiers engaged in friendly conversation with the protesters; some reports state that two tanks were seized and some troops disarmed. Then the Soviet General Konstantin Rokossovsky, the Minister of National Defense, who was then in command of all armed forces in Poland, decided to take personal control, and the situation changed dramatically.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant Colonel F. O. Chilton's 2/2nd Infantry Battalion {{found that}} it was best to keep skirmishing forward {{throughout}} this advance, because going to ground {{for any length of time}} meant sitting in the middle of the enemy artillery concentrations that inflicted further casualties. The Australian troops made good progress, six tank crossings were readied and mines <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wire had been detected. Five minutes later, the 23 Matildas of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment advanced, accompanied by the 2/2nd Infantry Battalion. Passing through the gaps, they swung right along the double line of posts.|$|E
5|$|Nearly razed to {{the ground}} in 1960 along with other {{buildings}} on Lafayette Square, successful lobbying and support from the newly elected Kennedy administration in 1961 led to the original proposals to gut the building being dropped. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was instrumental in persuading architect John Carl Warnecke, a friend of her husband, to create a design that would incorporate the new buildings with the old, based on the architectural theory of contextualism. The Cutts-Madison House, Cosmos Club building, and Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House were joined, and a courtyard built <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> National Courts building. The building has remained part of the National Courts Building complex ever since, and is now protected by the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Neither paramountcy nor the {{subsidiary}} alliances {{could continue}} after Indian independence. The British took {{the view that}} {{because they had been}} established directly between the British crown and the princely states, they could not be transferred to the newly independent dominions of India and Pakistan. At the same time, the alliances imposed obligations on Britain that it was not prepared to continue to carry out, such as the obligation to maintain troops in India for the defence of the princely states. The British government therefore decided that paramountcy, together with all treaties <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> princely states, would come to an end upon the British departure from India.|$|E

5|$|On October 6, 2016, {{prior to}} the 2016–17 season, Bozon {{was traded to the}} Florida Panthers in {{exchange}} for Jonathan Racine. He was immediately assigned to the Springfield Thunderbirds of the AHL for their inaugural season, and spent the season <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Manchester Monarchs of the ECHL, scoring 15 points in 43 games for Springfield, and another 6 points in 14 games for the Monarchs. At the end of the season, and with his NHL contract over, Bozon signed a contract with Kloten to return to Switzerland for the following season. Because he played junior in the Swiss system, Bozon would not count against the team's import limit, despite being French.|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} an episode in 1279AD, when the {{successor}} of the last great Chola Emperor, pending invasion, sends his people to a mystery location, to survive the threat. The story resumes with an archaeologist, a coolie {{and a member of}} the army going in search of the archaeologist's father to the ruined city that was the place the exiled Chola Prince retreated to. An expedition is promptly arranged, and on the course they stumble on the lost Chola civilization and its king and find unexplained links <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> culture. The shocking events and the problems that arise forms the crux of the story.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot with the {{anamorphic}} process. Peckinpah and his cinematographer, Lucien Ballard, also {{made use of}} telephoto lenses, that allowed for objects and people in both the background and foreground to be compressed in perspective. The effect is best seen in the shots where the Bunch makes the walk to Mapache's headquarters to free Angel. As they walk forward, a constant flow of people passes <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> camera; {{most of the people}} in the foreground are as sharply focused as the Bunch. The editing of the film is notable in that shots from multiple angles were spliced together in rapid succession, often at different speeds, placing greater emphasis on the chaotic nature of the action and the gunfights.|$|E
