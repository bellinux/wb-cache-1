In this sequel paper, {{the effects of}} annealing the same cold-drawn wire on microstructure and mechanical properties are examined. Specifically, segments of the <b>wire</b> were <b>annealed</b> for 1 h at 973 K, 1023 K, 1073 K, 1123 K and 1173 K in a vacuum furnace. The resulting microstructure was characterized by SEM, EBSD and TEM and compared to the asdrawn microstructure. In-situ heating in the TEM of MP 35 N ribbon in a similarly cold worked condition enabled corroboration of microstructure evolution during <b>annealing.</b> <b>Annealed</b> <b>wires</b> were tested monotonically and cyclically in uniaxial tension at room temperature, the latter using a stress ratio (R) of 0. 3. In addition, the <b>annealed</b> <b>wires</b> were tested cyclically at R= - 1 using the rotating beam bending fatigue test. Post-deformation structures and fracture surfaces were characterized using TEM and SEM respectively. Annealing the cold drawn wire results in recrystallization and grain growth; the extent {{is dependent on the}} annealing temperature. Deformation twin boundaries in the as-drawn structure illustrate faceted bulging and eventually complete elimination, the microstructure evolving into fine equiaxed grains containing coarser annealing twins with no significant change in texture. Yield strength decreases rapidly with recrystallization to almost half the value of the as-drawn condition, but is accompanied by an increase in modulus (by similar to 25 %) and tensile elongation reaching 30 %. Cyclic response by the way of S-N curves is not enhanced by annealing on an absolute stress scale (due to the loss in yield strength) although the <b>annealed</b> <b>wires</b> are cyclically superior when the stress data are normalized by yield stress.

The thermal stability and GMI fluctuating variation at different temperature of three-type wires could be quantificationally characterized by GMImax ratio variation difference Δ[ΔZ/Zmax]Tmax of three-type wires, and drastically improved with the driving frequency increasing to 10 MHz, and the working range of magnetic field for possible sensor applications should be below 10 Oe.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} mechanisms of pit elimination in strip drawing and rolling of stainless steel strips. Strip drawing tests with artificial in-dents confirm the role of micro-plasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (MPHL) in allowing pits to be reduced in size and depth. The similarity of results for two oils, which differ in viscosity {{by a factor of}} 10, is attributed to the fact that oil is drawn out of the pits rather easily, so that the behavior tends to the unlubricated case. Similar behavior is observed for strip drawing of shot blast white hot band. For much smoother <b>bright</b> <b>anneal</b> strip, it is suggested that the presence of an oil film in the unpitted region prevents generation of pressure differences between the pits and the unpitted regions. A comparison of strip-drawn and cold-rolled stainless steel samples show that the change in pit area and Rq roughness varies with overall reduction in a remarkably similar way. The reason for such similar behavior is attributed to the absence of hydrodynamic action in preventing pit elimination, albeit for opposite reasons. The similar rate of pit evolution in both cases confirms the usefulness of the strip drawing rig as a tool to model the change of surface topography during rolling, as long as care is taken in matching the regimes of lubrica-tion.

40|$|International audienceElectric charges at {{the surface}} of a passive {{stainless}} steel are generally considered as concentrated either in the passive film itself, or at the metal/passive film interface, or in the electrical double layer at the film solution interface. Rest potential time dependence after immersion of a passive surface in aqueous electrolytes suggests however that slow processes occur in the onset of the surface charge. Specific experiments, such as streaming potential measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in a thin electrolyte cell, were carried out for understanding better this phenomenon. An AISI 304 type austenitic stainless steel with polished or <b>bright</b> <b>annealed</b> surface finishes was immersed in NaCl aqueous solutions with various pH and chloride concentrations. The streaming potential time evolution shows two steps: a first rapid one (~ 2 min) is attributed to the onset of the surface charge. The second step is much slower (approximately several hours) and possibly due to an interphase layer between the passive film and the solution. Following this idea, the whole kinetics is controlled by cation migration across the interphase when the pH is larger than the isoelectric pH (pH iep), while chloride ions are incorporated in the interphase when pH  iep. Impedance measurements allow determining both the kinetics of charge transport and the thin cell conductivity. When glass is used as reference material for the cell walls instead of stainless steel, the Nyquist plots show a high-frequency response. For stainless steel cell walls, a low-frequency response is observed, attributed to a slow charge reorganisation inside the interphase layer.
