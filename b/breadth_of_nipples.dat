40|$|Background: Persistent nipple pain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common reasons given by mothers for ceasing {{exclusive}} breastfeeding. We aimed to determine the frequency <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> pain as a reason for consultation, the most common attributed aetiologies, and the effectiveness of the advice and treatment given. Methods: All consultations at the Breast Feeding Centre of Western Australia (WA) were audited over two six-month periods in 2011 (n = 469) and 2014 (n = 708). Attributed cause(s) <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> pain, microbiology results, treatment(s) advised, and resolution of pain were recorded. Results: Nipple pain was one of the reasons for consultation in 36 % of cases. The most common attributed cause <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> pain was incorrect positioning and attachment, followed by tongue tie, infection, palatal anomaly, flat or inverted nipples, mastitis, and vasospasm. Advice included correction of positioning and attachment, use <b>of</b> a <b>nipple</b> shield, resting the nipples and expressing breastmilk, frenotomy, oral antibiotics, topical treatments, and cold or warm compresses. Pain was resolving or resolved in 57 % of cases after 18 days (range 2 – 110). Conclusion: The multiple attributed causes <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> pain, possibly as a result of a cascade of events, suggests that effective early lactation management for prevention <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> pain and early diagnosis and effective treatment are crucial to avoid early weaning...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND : The {{last several}} decades h ave {{witnessed}} significant advances in the surgical management of carcinoma breast. Many have embraced breast conservation as the procedure of choice in carefully selected patients. It provides excellent cosmetic results side by side being oncologically saf e. Recent evidences have shown that involvement <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> areola complex in breast cancer have been over estimated in the past based on older concept of occult tumor in the region <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> and areola. Preservation <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> and areola improves {{the quality of life}} and reduces the feeling of mutilation and thus is a logical step in conservative management of breast carcinoma. AIMS: (a) To investigate the actual involvement <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> areola complex clinically and histopathologically. (b) To determine the asso ciated risk factors like site, size, distance, grading and lymph node status. MATERIALS AND METHOD S: This was a prospective study over a period of 2008 - 2011 carried out at Department of General Surgery of a tertiary care centre. Total number of patients i ncluded in the study was 54. All patients included in the study had undergone mastectomy for carcinoma of breast (excluding those patients who had clinical involvement <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> areola complex).

40|$|BackgroundLoss <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> {{projection}} is {{a common}} problem following nipple reconstruction. The {{aim of this study}} was to demonstrate that the use of a tightly rolled dermal graft is effective in the long-term maintenance <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> projection. MethodsNipple reconstruction was performed using the C-V flap technique. A dermal graft was harvested from the dog-ear portion of previous scars. The graft was rolled tightly into a compact cylinder and used to augment the nipple reconstruction. Postoperatively, stacked Allevyn dressing was used for protecting the nipple from compression for a minimum <b>of</b> two months. <b>Nipple</b> projection was measured at the time of surgery and at 12 months postoperatively. ResultsForty nipple reconstructions were performed using this technique. There were 19 transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flaps, 10 latissimus dorsi (LD) flaps, and 11 tissue-expanded breast mounds. At one year, the mean projection was 0. 80 cm (range, 0. 62 - 1. 22 cm). The twelve-month average maintenance <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> projection was 70. 2 % for the TRAM flap group, 76. 3 % for the LD flap group, and 61. 8 % for the tissue-expanded group. In two patients with previous irradiation of the reconstructed breasts, relatively poor maintenance <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> projection was noted (45. 7 %). No complications were noted, and all of the donor sites healed well primarily. ConclusionsOur results demonstrated that the use of a C-V flap with a tightly rolled dermal graft for nipple reconstruction improves the long-term maintenance <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> projection. Its advantages include reproducibility, technical simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and minimal donor site morbidity...|$|R

40|$|Background: Sore nipples {{are common}} during {{lactation}} and remain {{the major reason}} for failing to establish successful breastfeeding. To formulate a peppermint gel and to evaluate {{its effect on the}} prevention <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> crack associated with breast-feeding, a randomized double-blinded clinical trial comparing the above formulation with modified lanolin and a neutral ointment was carried out. Material/Methods: Two hundred and sixteen primiparous participants were assigned randomly to three groups. Each group applied only one of the above three preparations on both breasts for 14 days. Each group consisted of 72 primiparous mothers and was seen for a maximum of four follow-up visits within 14 days and a final visit at week 6.

In this study, person-centered analyses were used to examine patterns <b>of</b> <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> participation in both organized and unstructured leisure activities among rural adolescents (N = 276, 49 % female) across grades 7, 8, and 10.

The most popular activity types across profile groups were hanging out with friends, team sports, and outdoor activities. Adolescents involved in a greater <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> organized activities reported the greatest <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> involvement in unstructured leisure and the best functioning.

In contrast to the breast nipple syringoma, which expressed glandular keratins K 8 / 18 / 19, syringoma of the skin only expressed the glandular keratin K 19. Therefore, syringomas <b>of</b> the breast <b>nipple</b> and <b>of</b> the skin resemble glandular lineages <b>of</b> the breast <b>nipple</b> duct or eccrine duct epithelium, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Nipple adenoma is a {{relatively}} rare benign breast neoplasm, and cases of the disease arising from the axillary accessory breast have very seldom {{been reported in the}} English literature. We report a case <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> adenoma arising from axillary accessory breast including clinical and pathological findings. An 82 -year-old woman presented with the complaint of a small painful mass in the right axilla. Physical examination confirmed a well-defined eczematous crusted mass that was 8 mm in size. The diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> adenoma was made from an excisional specimen on the basis of characteristic histological findings. Microscopic structural features included a compact proliferation of small tubules lined by epithelial and myoepithelial cells, and the merging of glandular epithelial cells of the adenoma into squamous epithelial cells in the superficial epidermal layer. Because clinically nipple adenoma may resemble Paget’s disease and pathologically can be misinterpreted as tubular carcinoma, the correct identification <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> adenoma {{is an important factor in}} the differential diagnosis for axillary tumor neoplasms.

40|$|While nipple pain {{is common}} in the first 10 days of {{breastfeeding}} and during the infant’s teething process, sore nipples should not persist beyond this period and are often disregarded as “normal ” by many providers. Sore and painful nipples are NOT normal side effects <b>of</b> breastfeeding. Sore <b>nipples</b> {{may be due to}} abrasions that occur during feeding or from tight fitting clothing. These breaks in the skin pre-dispose the mother to infections <b>of</b> the <b>nipple,</b> as well as mastitis. Less common causes include psoriasis, eczema and contact dermatitis. Always bring mother in for a nipple and latch evaluation. Improper latch or flat/inverted nipples are common causes <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> pain without infection. Consult with an IBCLC to evaluate latch depth and consider changing position during feeding or use <b>of</b> a <b>nipple</b> shield if indicated. If pumping, have mother bring in her pump and flanges to ensure a proper fit. Remember to evaluate the infant for ankyloglossia as a potential cause <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> pain. For non-infected cracked nipples, breast milk combined with nipple cream, such as lanolin may promote healing thus we often encourage patients to express and apply breast milk to the healing nipple after and in-between feeds. Early intervention of skin breaks in the nipple is recommended to prevent secondary impetigo or candidiasis...|$|R
