50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{various parts of}} Stony Brook were {{converted}} into underground culverts or sewers. In around 1882, the Back Bay Fens were dredged to convert them into a holding basin for storm overflow from Stony Brook, following Olmsted's plan, and at {{around the same time}} its waters were diverted into an <b>intercepting</b> <b>sewer</b> near the current Ruggles Station.|$|R
50|$|Prior to this work, central London's drains {{were built}} {{primarily}} {{to cope with}} rain water, and the growing use of flush toilets frequently meant that they became overloaded, flushing sewage and industrial effluent into the River Thames.

50|$|There {{had been}} a long history of failed {{proposals}} to embank the Thames in central London. Embankments along the Thames were first proposed by Christopher Wren in the 1660s, then in 1824 former soldier and aide to George IV, Sir Frederick Trench suggested an embankment known as 'Trench's Terrace' from Blackfriars to Charing Cross. Trench brought a bill to Parliament which was blocked by river interests. In the 1830s, the painter John Martin promoted an embankment to contain an <b>intercepting</b> <b>sewer.</b> In January 1842 the City Corporation adopted a plan designed by James Walker but the plan fell foul of government infighting. The government itself built the Chelsea Embankment in 1854 from Chelsea Hospital to Millbank.|$|R
50|$|As Britain was {{the first}} country to industrialize, {{it was also the}} first to {{experience}} the disastrous consequences of major urbanisation and {{was the first}} to construct a sewerage system {{as we know it today}} to mitigate the resultant unsanitary conditions. Joseph Bazalgette designed an extensive underground sewerage system that diverted waste to the Thames Estuary, downstream of the main centre of population. Six main interceptor sewers, totalling almost 135 miles (217 km) in length, were constructed. The <b>intercepting</b> <b>sewers,</b> constructed between 1859 and 1865, were fed by 450 miles (720 km) of main sewers that, in turn, conveyed the contents of some 13,000 miles (21,000 km) of smaller local sewers. With only minor modifications, Bazalgette's engineering achievement remains the basis for sewerage design up into the present day.|$|R

Sewers north of the Thames feed into the Northern Outfall Sewer, which fed into a major treatment works at Beckton. South of the river, the Southern Outfall Sewer extended to a similar facility at Crossness. With only minor modifications, Bazalgette's engineering achievement remains the basis for sewerage design up into the present day.|$|R

40|$|Background: Below each large city, there lies {{a network}} of many {{hundreds}} of kilometer of sewers, ranging from small pipes to large <b>intercepting</b> <b>sewers.</b> The job of being a sewermen entails several occupational hazards which pose a great danger {{to the health and}} wellbeing and life of the worker; a stark reminder of the importance of employers liability insurance. Sewage workers are exposed to accidental hazards and suffer from occupational lung diseases and upper respiratory tract infections, eye problems, gastrointestinal problems and musculoskeletal problems. Objectives: The present study was conducted to assess the morbidity profile and their prevalence among sewage workers in Mumbai city. Material and Methods: A Cross-sectional study was conducted from May 2005 to October 2005. A total of 150 sewage workers were interviewed and examined. A pre-tested interview tool was used to collect necessary information such as clinical history, socio-demographic profile, clinical examination findings and investigations performed. Results were analysed using Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) 13. 0. Results: Eye problems were most predominant, seen in 70. 6 % workers followed by musculoskeletal problems (68. 0 %), while 58. 0 % workers presented with gastrointestinal and 52. 6 % with respiratory ailment, with obstructive pattern observed in 38 (48. 1 %) subjects being the major finding. Fifty two percent workers had skin problems and injuries were observed in 39 (26. 0 %) workers including minor injuries such as cuts, abrasions and lacerations.

40|$|The {{formation}} and fate of sulfide in a force main and a downstream-located gravity sewer were investigated in an extensive field study. Sulfide formation during approximately 4 hours of anaerobic transport in the force main was significant. The following gravity sewer was aerobic and a fast {{reduction of the}} sulfide concentration was observed due to sulfide oxidation and emission of hydrogen sulfide gas to the sewer atmosphere. During 14 minutes of transport in the gravity sewer, the sulfide concentration decreased on average 30 %. Despite the continuous emission of hydrogen sulfide, the concentration in {{the atmosphere of the}} gravity sewer was generally below 3 % of the concentration in equilibrium with the sulfide concentration in the wastewater. This observation demonstrated that removal of hydrogen sulfide gas by adsorption onto the sewer walls exposed to the sewer atmosphere was fast compared with emission from the wastewater. An application of a conceptual sewer process model for simulating the {{formation and}} fate of sulfide in wastewater collection systems was demonstrated. The model was able to reproduce the average conditions in the investigated <b>intercepting</b> <b>sewer</b> satisfactory, but could not account for the observed variability. Overall, the model predicted that approximately 90 % of the decrease of the sulfide concentration in the gravity sewer was due to sulfide oxidation and that only a small fraction entered the sewer atmosphere, causing odor and corrosion.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} some results of two surveys at sea {{carried out in}} the {{surroundings}} of a urban wastewater discharge on the coast of the Golfo di Palermo, western Sicily (Italy). At the time of the surveys (year 2005) the stretch of water lying before {{the central part of the}} capital town received the untreated wastewater originating from about 200 000 inhabitants, which was discharged on-shore without any prior treatment by the free-surface outfall of “Porta Felice main sewer”. This outfall has crucial importance in the water quality; indeed, the Municipality is steadily implementing a plan featuring an <b>intercepting</b> main <b>sewer</b> along the coast and some pumping stations to connect all the main sewers to the main wastewater treatment plant, located in the SE boundary area of the town. At the moment of the surveys, however, no mitigation measure had been applied yet and the quality of the Gulf was still largely affected by it. Part of the Sanitation Plan was the characterization of the seawater; to this aim, in August and November, 2005, the Università degli Studi di Palermo - on behalf of the Municipality’s Ufficio del Centro Storico - carried out two survey cruises in which the most important seawater quality features were investigated.

In the following year, the River Medlock Improvement Committee became the Rivers Committee, and proposed a combined drainage scheme {{for the city and}} 15 other authorities with responsibility for the areas around the city. All pulled out of the scheme because of the likely cost, but in 1888, the City of Manchester decided to proceed on its own. Two deep level sewers were authorised, which <b>intercepted</b> the existing <b>sewers</b> before they discharged into the rivers. When the first sewer reached Davyhulme, further progress was impeded by the Manchester Ship Canal, then being built, and the site became the location of the sewage treatment works. It had the advantage that treated water could be discharged into the ship canal to maintain water levels.|$|R
