40|$|The {{impact of}} hop variety and hop aroma on {{perceived}} beer bitterness intensity and character was investigated using analytical and sensory methods. <b>Beers</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>malt</b> extract were hopped with 3 distinctive hop varieties (Hersbrucker, East Kent Goldings, Zeus) to achieve equi-bitter levels. A trained sensory panel determined the bitterness character profile of each singly-hopped beer using a novel lexicon. Results showed different bitterness character profiles for each beer, with hop aroma {{also found to}} change the hop variety-derived bitterness character profiles of the beer. Rank-rating evaluations further showed the significant effect of hop aroma on selected key bitterness character attributes, by increasing perceived harsh and lingering bitterness, astringency, and bitterness intensity via cross-modal flavour interactions.

5000|$|The {{leaders of}} the SBA named Herman Weiss of Galveston as the company's first brewmaster. [...] Shiner was {{originally}} a [...] "Lenten" [...] beer, only available in the spring.

They found one in Bavarian-born Kosmos Spoetzl, a onetime soldier who had trained as a brewmaster in his native Germany. Part of the package that lured Spoetzl to Shiner was potential ownership of the brewery. In 1914, he co-leased it with Oswald Petzold with an option to buy in 1915, which he did, giving the brewery his own name but continuing to call the brews Shiner Beers. Spoetzl had attended brewmaster's school and apprenticed for three years in Germany, worked for eight years at the Pyramids Brewery in Cairo, Egypt, and then worked in Canada.

40|$|M. Tech. (Food Technology) Abstract: Beer is an {{alcoholic}} beverage <b>made</b> <b>from</b> cereal grains (especially malted barley) and consumed worldwide including South Africa. However, beer consumption could {{be accompanied by}} moderate to severe mycotoxin exposure amongst consumers which originates principally from contaminated cereals used as ingredients for beer production. Aflatoxins (AFs), ochratoxin A (OTA), deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA) and fumonisins (FBs) {{have been found to}} be the most significant mycotoxins associated with beer contamination. They are produced by some mycotoxigenic fungal strains belonging mainly to the Aspergillus, Penicillium and Fusarium genera. Ochratoxin producing Aspergillus and Penicillium species have been recognized as the most prevalent fungi in South African barley and are thus implicated as principal sources of OTA in <b>beer</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>malted</b> barley. Ochratoxin A, like some other mycotoxins, occasionally finds itself into the beer but its levels may be reduced during the brewing process. Decreases of less than 20 % of OTA can be achieved during this process. Adsorption to particulate matter during various filtration processes has been noted as the major means of mycotoxin decontamination during beer manufacturing. Therefore, the beer filtration stage, a finishing stage of beer processing, is a very important and effective stage for mycotoxin removal, with filter aids playing a significant role. However, no studies have been reported on their effectiveness to remove certain mycotoxins, especially OTA during beer processing in South Africa and elsewhere. In this study, a laboratory beer filtration method using two filter aids currently used in breweries worldwide was adopted. Among the suitable filter aids employed for precise beer filtration, diatomaceous earth (DE) Celite® 577 (C 577) and rice hull ash (RHA) Pattern II described as an emerging filter aid proposed as an alternative to DE; similar in their chemical composition were selected in this study and tested against OTA removal during beer filtration. Secondly, OTA adsorptive capacity test was also performed following the adsorption isotherm method to better understand the mechanism of OTA removal. The filtration method was adopted and validated following the laboratory vacuum filtration system, utilizing a Buchner funnel containing a filtration medium constituted by a septum (filter paper) supporting the filter aid cake, then tested on the removal capacity of OTA on distilled water and a beer samples spiked with OTA (100 [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Ikigage is a Rwandese {{traditional}} <b>beer</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> sorghum <b>malt</b> {{and local}} plants, mainly Vernonia amygdalina “umubirizi”. However, this beer remains less attractive than Western beers of pils type {{because of poor}} hygienic quality, variations of organoleptic quality and limited shelf life. The aim of this work is to characterize ikigage beer {{in order to improve}} its hygienic quality and to reduce the organoleptic variations using the local raw materials. The first part of our study shows that ikigage beer marketed in Rwanda is characterized by the presence of Stapylococcus aureus and many micro-organisms of fecal origin (Escherichia coli and fecal streptococci), by the low ethanol content, high total acidity and an important amounts of proteins. The yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Issatckenkia orientalis), followed by the lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus buchneri), are the predominant microorganisms involved in fermentation of ikigage beer fermentation. Besides, one of the major problems in sorghum beer brewing is the efficient conversion of the starch extracts into fermentable sugars due to the weak activity of β-amylase in sorghum malt. The use of Eleusine coracana “uburo” (Musama variety) malt (30 %), associated with mashing decantation procedure, increases the content of sugar fermentable, maltose particularly, in sorghum wort, and consequently ethanol content in the beer. The second part of our study shows that V. amygdalina, known for its antibacterial properties and its bitterness similar to hops, contributes to the production of methyl salycilate, beta-damascenone and many terpenes compounds (δ- 3 -carene, β-farnesene, farnesol, β-citronellol and linalool), in the sorghum beer “ikigage”. This work reveals also the presence of 14 polyfunctional thiols in beers brewed with ‘non-Western’ raw materials. Among them, the well-known hop constituent 3 -methyl- 2 -buten- 1 -thiol emerged as a key flavour in the unhopped beers containing V. amygdalina. V. amygdalina also contributes to the production of 1 -butanethiol and 4 -sulfanyl- 4 -methyl- 2 -pentanone in sorghum beer. However, contrary to hops, V. amygdalina addition during boiling also appears to strongly inhibit the production of 2 -sulfanylethyl acetate. The third part of our study shows that the use of S. cerevisiae in combination with I. orientalis and L. fermentum as starter allows producing ikigage beer having the GRAS (generally recognized as safe) statute while preserving the organoleptic characteristics similar to those of local traditional beer “ikigage” produced by peasants...|$|R

40|$|Zambian Breweries (ZB) has {{developed}} a clear <b>beer</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> locally grown sorghum.

Sorghum is Zambia s third most important cereal crop after maize and finger millet. The Cooperative League of the United States of America - Smallholder Enterprise and Marketing Programme (CLUSA- SHEMP), a USAID/IFAD-funded project, helped farmers produce a crop that would meet standards required by ZB. Over 4, 000 small-scale farmers are benefiting, selling their sorghum direct to ZB. CLUSA/SHEMP is providing them with loans to procure inputs and implements, and is giving professional and technical advice on sorghum growing and how the harvested crop could meet quality standards. A total of 247 ha were planted for the 2004 / 2005 farming season. Expected to yield between 170 and 300 t of grain, the total revenue for the season for local farmers is around ZMK 216 million (about US$ 43, 200 or 36, 250).
