2500|$|Several {{researchers}} have criticized Eliade's work as having no empirical support. Thus, {{he is said}} to have [...] "failed to provide an adequate methodology for the history of religions and to establish this discipline as an empirical science", though the same critics admit that [...] "the history of religions should not aim at being an empirical science anyway". Specifically, his claim that the sacred is a structure of human consciousness is distrusted as not being empirically provable: [...] "no one has yet turned up the <b>basic</b> <b>category</b> sacred". Also, there has been mention of his tendency to ignore the social aspects of religion. Anthropologist Alice Kehoe is highly critical of Eliade's work on Shamanism, namely because he was not an anthropologist but a historian. She contends that Eliade never did any field work or contacted any indigenous groups that practiced Shamanism, and that his work was synthesized from various sources without being supported by direct field research.|$|E

5000|$|Ryle's The Concept of Mind (1949) is a {{critique}} of the notion that the mind is distinct from the body, and a rejection of the theory that mental states are separable from physical states. In this book Ryle refers {{to the idea of a}} fundamental distinction between mind and matter as [...] "the ghost in the machine". According to Ryle, the classical theory of mind, or [...] "Cartesian rationalism", makes a <b>basic</b> <b>category</b> mistake, because it attempts to analyze the relation between [...] "mind" [...] and [...] "body" [...] as if they were terms of the same logical category. This confusion of logical categories may be seen in other theories of the relation between mind and matter. For example, the idealist theory of mind makes a <b>basic</b> <b>category</b> mistake by attempting to reduce physical reality to the same status as mental reality, while the materialist theory of mind makes a <b>basic</b> <b>category</b> mistake by attempting to reduce mental reality to the same status as physical reality.|$|E
