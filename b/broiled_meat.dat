40|$|Twenty-three Charolais steers, {{slaughtered}} at 31 {{months of}} age and an average live weight of either 674 kg (light group; n= 13) or 751 kg (heavy group; n= 10) {{were used to determine}} the effect of increasing weight at slaughter by genetic selection on meat quality traits. Steers were born to pure-bred Charolais cows from an INRA experimental herd, reared and finished under the same breeding practices. The quality of meat from the M. rectus abdominis excised 24 h postmortem was scored after 14 days ageing between 0 and 10 by sensory analysis using four descriptors: global assessment, initial tenderness, overall tenderness, juiciness and flavor intensity. Shear force measurements were evaluated on raw and <b>broiled</b> <b>meat</b> after 14 days of ageing. The pH, collagen and lipid contents, the collagen solubility, isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), lactate dehydrogenase and cytochrome-c oxidase activities and the proportion of myosin heavy chain isoforms were measured 24 h post-slaughter. The heavy group was characterized by a significantly higher empty live weight (683 vs 614 kg) and carcass weight (before removing external fat: 469 vs 408 kg; after removing external fat: 463 vs 403 kg) at slaughter than the light one but an equivalent fatness score (2. 74 on 5). Scores of heavy steer M. rectus abdominis were significantly higher for descriptors of initial tenderness (6. 95 vs 6. 31) and overall tenderness (6. 79 vs 6. 22) although the intramuscular fat content was equivalent for light and heavy group samples (16. 6 % of dry matter on average). Global assessment and flavor intensity were also slightly in favor of heavy group samples (6. 49 vs 5. 85 and 6. 48 vs 6. 07), but no {{differences were found between the}} two groups in meat juiciness (6. 10 on average). Shear force on raw and <b>broiled</b> <b>meat</b> was not significantly different between groups (5. 13 and 6. 98 daN on average).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop a}} {{simplified}} questionnaire for self-evaluation by adolescents of foods {{associated with the}} risk of coronary diseases. METHODS: Frequency questionnaires about 80 foods were answered by representative samples of 256 adolescents aged 12 to 19 from Rio de Janeiro {{as part of the}} Nutrition and Health Research project. The dependent variable was the serum cholesterol predicting equation as influenced by diet, and the independent variables were the foods. The variables were normalized and, using Pearson's correlation coefficient, those with r> 0. 10 were selected for the regression model. The model was analyzed for sex, age, random sample, and total calories. Those food products that explained 85 % of the cholesterol variation equation were present in the caloric model, and contained trans fatty acids were selected for the questionnaire. RESULTS: Sixty-five food products had a statistically significant correlation (P< 0. 001) with the dependent variable. The simplified questionnaire included 9 food products present in all tested models: steak or <b>broiled</b> <b>meat,</b> hamburger, full-fat cheese, French fries or potato chips, whole milk, pies or cakes, cookies, sausages, butter or margarine. The limit of the added food points for self-evaluation was 100, and over 120 points was considered excessive.

Eleven cases have been found at Oshinara, Nawamachi, Saihaku-gun, Tottori prefecture. The incidence of the infection with T. saginata is high among the grownups in both men and women. The infection may occur when raw or inadequately boiled or <b>broiled</b> <b>meat</b> is eaten. There was a marked increase in the incidence of infection with T. saginata immediately {{after the end of the}} war. Determination of the infection should be based not merely on the detection of eggs in stools but also on form of the uterus in each segment of the worm of adult form. Most of those under study harbored one worm. The infection was attended by such subjective symptoms as abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and intestinal sound, and such objective symptoms as abdominal tenderness, enlargement of the liver, anemic complexion, and irregular pulse. No marked anemic symptoms were found in general, and there was disturbance of liver function in some cases. If no worms are found in stools during the 3 months after the worms have been expelled, the patient may be considered entirely free from infection with T. stginata.

40|$|Cutaneous {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most prevalent invasive malignancy with metastatic potential. The epidermis is exposed {{to a variety of}} environmental DNA-damaging chemicals, principal among which are polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) ubiquitous in the environment, tobacco smoke, and <b>broiled</b> <b>meats.</b> Langerhans cells (LC) comprise a network of dendritic cells situated adjacent to basal, suprabasal, and follicular infundibular keratinocytes that when mutated can give rise to SCC, and LC-intact mice are markedly more susceptible than LC-deficient mice to chemical carcinogenesis provoked by initiation with the model PAH, 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). LC rapidly internalize and depot DMBA as numerous membrane-independent cytoplasmic foci. Repopulation of LC-deficient mice using fetal liver LC-precursors restores DMBA-induced tumor susceptibility. LC expression of p 450 enzyme CYP 1 B 1 is required for maximal rapid induction of DNA-damage within adjacent keratinocytes and their efficient neoplastic transformation; however, effects of tumor progression also attributable to the presence of LC were revealed as CYP 1 B 1 -independent. Thus, LC make multifaceted contributions to cutaneous carcinogenesis, including via the handling and metabolism of chemical mutagens. Such findings suggest a cooperative carcinogenesis role for myeloid-derived cells resident within cancer susceptible epithelial tissues principally by influencing early events in malignant transformation...|$|R

Activation was evaluated by the total level of covalent binding of PhIP to macromolecules. Rat hepatocytes had the lowest rate of metabolism, both to reactive and detoxified metabolites. The products were identified as 4 '-PhIP-sulfate, PhIP-glucuronide, and N(OH) -PhIP-glucuronide. The ring hydroxylation rate was much greater in mouse hepatocytes, the main products being 4 '-PhIP-sulfate and 4 -hydroxy-PhIP. The level of covalent binding in the mouse hepatocytes exceeded those of the rat and guinea pig at high doses of PhIP. An extensive metabolism was seen in guinea pig hepatocytes, the major products being 4 '-PhIP-sulfate, 4 '-O-PhIP glucuronide, PhIP-glucuronide, and N(OH) -PhIP-glucuronide. In addition, several other unknown metabolites were formed. However, the amount of covalent binding in guinea pig hepatocytes {{was similar to that}} in rat hepatocytes. Covalent binding of PhIP metabolites was highest in hamster hepatocytes. Three of the main metabolites were identified as 4 '-PhIP-sulfate, 4 '-O-PhIP-glucuronide, and PhIP-glucuronide, but several unknown PhIP metabolites also were formed. Only minor amounts of N(OH) -PhIP-glucuronide were produced in the hamster.

40|$|In {{practice}} cattle may be slaughtered {{at different}} combinations of age and weight. As each of these factors could affect meat quality traits, the present work aimed to identify which combination {{can be expected to}} increase overall meat quality of m. rectus abdominis of Charolais heifers. Totally, 40 heifers were slaughtered either at 26 +/- 1 or at 36 +/- 1 months of age. Young heifers were sampled at two different carcass weights (349 +/- 12 and 394 +/- 8 kg). Old heifers were also sampled at two different carcass weights (397 +/- 6 and 451 +/- 9 kg). The m. rectus abdominis was excised 24 h postmortem to determine metabolic enzyme activities, myosin heavy-chain isoform proportions, lipid contents, collagen content and collagen solubility. Shear force measurements were evaluated on raw and <b>broiled</b> <b>meat</b> after 14 days of ageing. Meat quality traits scored between 0 and 10 by sensory analysis. Increasing slaughter age from 26 to 36 months had no impact on either raw/broiled shear force (0. 31 <= P <= 0. 47) and/or meat quality traits (0. 62 <= P <= 0. 91) or on physicochemical properties of heifer's meat samples. Increasing carcass weight for a similar slaughter age of 26 months had also impact neither on meat quality traits (0. 52 <= P <= 0. 91) nor on muscular properties. On the contrary, increasing carcass weight for a similar slaughter age of 36 months had induced a decrease of muscular shear force (raw muscle; P= 0. 009) and a concomitant decrease of total collagen content (P= 0. 03). Nevertheless, no significant impact on meat quality traits was revealed by the sensorial panel (0. 13 P 0. 49). Metabolic enzyme activities (0. 13 <= P <= 0. 86) and myosin heavy-chain proportions (0. 13 <= P <= 0. 96) were not significantly impacted by slaughter age and carcass weight. Thus, the impact of increasing carcass weight and/or slaughter age in young Charolais heifers has a limited impact on meat quality traits and associated muscular characteristics. Modulating heifer's cycles (age and/or carcass weight in the studied range) appears to be a way to answer to the numerous marketing chains, without penalising meat quality traits...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} popularity of outdoor cooking of meat, there is interest in determining the chemical and physical changes that occur during the charcoal broiling process. Of particular interest {{is the effect of}} these changes upon the quality of the <b>broiled</b> <b>meat.</b> Although broiling is not a new method of cooking meat, {{a review of the literature}} revealed few reports of scientific work on broiled meats. Some work has been done on the effect of different cooking methods on weight losses, tenderness, palatability, thiamine, protein content, but no reports were found relating surface temperature and cooking time to rate of heat transfer and to final internal temperature. Little research has been done in this area because there has been no means available for measuring surface temperature during broiling. The investigation and results reported in this study were made possible by the development of an experimental model of a coil type thermometer, developed by the Taylor Instrument Company, and an Electronic Universal Nine Point Strip Chart Recorder were used to record temperatures in this study. The thermometer determined the surface temperature of the grill and thermocouples attached to the meat and connected tot he recorder determined the top, internal, and bottom temperatures of the samples. This preliminary study was conducted on beef using charcoal as the source of heat, since the heat from the charcoal could be controlled at an approximately constant temperature. Studies by Salvosa (1963) and Irvine (1963) showed the interrelationships of surface temperature to cooking time and degree of doneness. One grade (Good) Sirloin, two grades (Good and Choice) Porterhouse steaks and ground beef patties were broiled in this study. The steaks were cut in two thicknesses, 1 and 1 / 12 inches, and were broiled at three different cooking temperatures (400 o, 350 o, and 300 o Fahrenheit) to three degrees of doneness. Statistical analysis using these variables produced a change of only two minutes in predicted cooking time. The current study, a continuation of the previous studies, was made to determine the relationships of surface temperature, cooking temperature, cooking time, and degree of doneness, to moisture, protein, and fat content of broiled beef. This study also included a compilation of thiamine and soluble protein results of the previous studies (Salvosa, 1963; and Irvine, 1963) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to {{investigate}} some aspects of epidemiology, risk factors and treatment with ECT in advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD). In study I, we performed a descriptive epidemiologic population-based survey in the Central Health Care District in Östergötland in south-east Sweden, {{with a population of}} almost 150, 000 inhabitants 1989. The case finding was accomplished in three ways: 1. Collection of all prescriptions for Parkinson’s disease. 2. Search in medical files. 3. Checking with all nursing homes in the area. The crude prevalence was found to be 115 per 100, 000 inhabitants. When we used the European Standard Population as a tool for easy comparisons of PD prevalence between different areas and time periods 76 PD-cases per 100, 000 inhabitants were found. The corresponding incidences were 11. 0 (crude) and 7. 9 (age standardised) per 100, 000 person-years. Mean age at onset was 65. 6. A low prevalence and a high age at onset suggested that e. g. environmental factors could influence the occurrence of PD, and the results implies that only few such factors were present in the investigated area. The findings led to study II, a case-control study which investigated the possible impact of nutritional and environmental risk factors for idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IP), including 113 cases and 263 control subjects. Dietary, drinking, and smoking habits, as well as previous occupation, were requested in a structured questionnaire. No increased risk was found for any of the nutrients. A reduced risk was found for coffee, wine, and spirits but also for <b>broiled</b> <b>meat,</b> smoked ham or meat, eggs, French loaf or white bread, and tomatoes. These findings could indicate an antioxidant effect. Frequency of preceding and present smoking was reduced in IP patients. Possible mechanisms are discussed. Various occupational groups and exposures were analysed and increased risks of IP in men were found for agricultural work, pesticide exposure, male carpenters, and in female cleaners. In advanced PD {{there is a need for}} further therapeutic improvements, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one insufficiently explored and evaluated method. In study III ECT 16 non-depressed, nondemented PD patients with advanced disease were treated with ECT. In all patients an antiparkinsonian effect of ECT was seen, lasting between a few days and 18 months. Five patients, all with signs of blood brain barrier damage, developed transitory mental confusion after ECT. The results indicated that ECT could cause increased dopaminergic activity, which led us to study IV. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with the cocaine analogue [123 I]-β-CIT was used in order to visualise dopaminergic neurones in the brain. Six patients with PD were examined before and after a series of ECT, and in three cases SPECT was also repeated after one year. The side-to-side difference in the radiotracer uptake was found to be significantly lower in striatum located contralaterally to the part of the body with most pronounced symptomatology. No significant change in uptake of [123 I]-β-CIT was seen after ECT, although all patients improved and the most pronounced improvement was seen in patients with less advanced PD. Study V points at two new positive observations with maintenance ECT (MECT). i. e. repeated ECT treatment of PD. One patient had either severe mental side effects on higher L-dopa doses or intolerable parkinsonian symptoms on lower doses. MECT implied marked improvement in parkinsonian symptoms without mental side effects. Another PD patient, who also had a mental depression, showed slight improvement of motor symptoms on a series of ECT. When treated with MECT further antiparkinsonian effects were seen.

40|$|Background: As {{caffeine}} {{is specifically}} N 3 -demethylated by CYP 1 A 2, caffeine {{has been used}} as a metabolic probe to determine the relative CYP 1 A 2 activity in human. Grapefruit juice has been demonstrated to inhibit mammalian cytochrome P 450 enzymes like CYP 3 A 4. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine whether the grapefruit juice will inhibit the CYP 1 A 2 activity in unrelated healthy Korean subjects. Method: Volunteers(47 subjects) refraining from methylxanthine-containing foods or beverages were given a cup of coffee (110 mg caffeine) at 8 a. m [...] They voided urine at 12 a. m. and provided 1 hr urine sample at 1 p. m [...] On the second day, the volunteers were given 500 ml of grapefruit juice at 7 a. m. and at 8 a. m., they were given 1 cup of coffee. At 9 a. m. and 11 a. m., they were given 500 ml of grapefruit juice again. Again, the volunteers voided urine at 12 a. m. and provided the 1 hr urine sample at 1 p. m. The caffeine metabolites present in the urine samples from both days were analyzed with HPLC. The relative CYP 1 A 2 activities in each individual were calculated by taking the molar concentration ratio of [paraxanthine + 1, 7 -dimethylurate]/[caffeine]. Results: The basal CYP 1 A 2 activity for all volunteers was 15. 3 ± 7. 7 and after taking the grapefruit juice, the CYP 1 A 2 activity was decreased significantly to 10. 3 ± 6. 2 (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p< 0. 0001). Upon intake of the grapefruit juice, the CYP 1 A 2 activity was decreased in 39 volunteers but the CYP 1 A 2 activity in 8 was increase slightly. The CYP 1 A 2 activities of smokers either before or after the grapefruit juice intake were higher (Mann-Whitney U test, p< 0. 005) and thus, the induction of enzyme activity by cigarette smoking was confirmed. There were no significant differences in the fraction of CYP 1 A 2 inhibition between the nonsmokers and smokers, and the fraction of CYP 1 A 2 activity inhibition had no significant relationship with the basal activity. Conclusion : Intake of grapefruit juice will inhibit the CYP 1 A 2 activity in man and will interfere with the metabolism of clinically useful drugs which are metabolized by CYP 1 A 2. Therefore, in persons whose CYP 1 A 2 activity is severely inhibited by grapefruit juice, taking drugs metabolized by CYP 1 A 2 together with grapefruit juice could bring unexpected drug toxicity. Conversely, as the CYP 1 A 2 is known to ha involved in metabolic activation of procarcinogens belonging to aromatic amines (in cigarette) or heterocyclic amines (in <b>broiled</b> <b>meats),</b> taking grapefruit juice would lower the cancer susceptibility. ope...|$|R
50|$|The word teriyaki {{derives from}} the noun teri (照り), which refers to a shine or luster given by the sugar content in the tare (タレ), and yaki (焼き), which refers to the cooking method of {{grilling}} or <b>broiling.</b> Traditionally the <b>meat</b> is dipped in or brushed with sauce several times during cooking. This popular dish was originally created by Japanese cooks of the seventeenth century, when urbanization, changes in agricultural methods and exposure to new ingredients from abroad gave rise to new, innovative cooking styles. The tare (タレ) is traditionally made by mixing and heating soy sauce and sake (or mirin) and sugar (or honey). The sauce is boiled and reduced to the desired thickness, then used to marinate meat, which is then grilled or broiled. Sometimes ginger is added and the final dish may be garnished with spring onions.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to evaluate the percentage of some selected muscles of antelope relative to its half carcass weight, proximate composition of raw and cooked antelope meat as well as sensory attributes of the meat. Four antelopes of mixed sex and of 2 - 2. 5 years were used for this study. They were purchased live from Ago-Iwoye market in Ogun State, Nigeria and were transported to Meat Science Laboratory of the Department of Animal Production, Olabisi Onabanjo University, Yewa Campus, Ayetoro for processing. They were weighed, bled, eviscerated, washed and chilled at 4 oC for 24 hours. The carcasses were sawed into two halves and one half was weighed and fabricated into primal cuts. Selected muscles were excised from the cuts weighed and their percentages relative to chilled half carcass weight were determined. Proximate composition of raw and cooked semimembranosus and longissimus dorsi muscles {{as well as the}} taste panel evaluation of the two muscles was conducted on a 9 -point hedonic scale I correspond to dislike very much and 9 like very much after <b>broiling</b> the <b>meat</b> at 160 oC for 25 min. The results showed that longissimus dorsi muscle was biggest followed by biceps femoris, quadriceps femoris and semimembranosus muscles, while vectus abdomimis, bradclialis and biceps brachii muscles were smallest. Crude protein, ash, nitrogen free extract and tenderness were higher in cooked meat, while fat was lower. In conclusion, antelope (Antilope cervicapra) should be domesticated to complement the conventional livestocks so that adequate meat supply to growing human population can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAH) {{are a large}} group of compounds made up of two or more fused benzene rings. They are primarily formed by incomplete combustion or pyrolysis of organic matter and during various industrial processes. Consequently, they are found in automobile exhaust, smoke from fires or cigarettes and as a component of air pollution. PAHs generally occur in complex mixtures which may consist of hundreds of compounds. SOURCES PAH are formed whenever organic matter is burned. Emissions from vehicles, domestic heating, agricultural fires and industrial processes are likely to be important sources of atmospheric PAH in New Zealand. PAH are ubiquitous in the environment which means that food, air, water and soil are all potential routes of exposure. For non-smokers, food is regarded as the primary route of exposure. Foods which have been shown to have the highest levels of PAH include charcoal <b>broiled</b> or smoked <b>meats,</b> leafy vegetables, grains and fats and oils. The presence of PAH in leafy vegetables is believed to be due to atmospheric deposition (Benford et al., 2006) ...|$|R
