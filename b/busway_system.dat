The decision {{of investing in}} bus priority systems was stimulated {{by the federal government}} during the 80 's and was based on two main factors: the lack of funds to implement rail transit systems and the need to improve the performance of bus systems, as a real alternative of medium capacity transit system. Therefore, the paper describes the operational planning, the design, the operational schemes and the performance of referential Brazilian <b>busway</b> <b>systems.</b> Examples of different arrangements of <b>busway</b> transit <b>systems</b> are analyzed, including the trunk-and-feeder operation, the use of biarticulated buses and different layouts of bus stops. The paper covers the most expressive experiences of busway implementation in Brazil in the cities of Belo Horizonte, Campinas, Curitiba, Goiânia, Porto Alegre, Recife and São Paulo. Aspects that deserve improvements are also highlighted, including the introduction of ITS devices, which will contribute to the increase of the performance of busways, approaching them to the operation of a metro...|$|R
25|$|Metro Busway is {{an express}} bus system with {{characteristics}} of {{bus rapid transit}} with two lines operating on dedicated or shared-use <b>busways.</b> The <b>system</b> runs a total of 40 miles, with 27 stations and over 38,000 daily weekday boardings as of February 2012.|$|R
5000|$|On kerb-guided buses (KGB) small {{guide wheels}} {{attached}} to the bus engage vertical kerbs {{on either side of}} the guideway. These guide wheels push the steering mechanism of the bus, keeping it centralised on the track. Away from the guideway, the bus is steered in the normal way. The start of the guideway is funnelled from a wide track to guideway width. This system permits high-speed operation on a narrow guideway and precise positioning at boarding platforms, facilitating access for the elderly and disabled. As guide wheels can be inexpensively attached to, and removed from, almost any standard model of bus, kerb guided <b>busway</b> <b>systems</b> are not tied to particular specialised vehicles or equipment suppliers. Characteristically, operators contracted to run services on kerb-guided busways will purchase or lease the vehicles themselves; as second-hand vehicles (with guide wheels removed) have a ready resale market.|$|R

40|$|This paper uses {{state of}} the art stated choice designs to parameterise modal choice models for {{commuting}} and non-commuting travel futures in the presence of new public transport infrastructure (variations of new heavy rail, light rail and dedicated <b>busway</b> <b>systems).</b> D-optimal choice experiments are developed for a set of labelled modal alternatives in which respondents establish a reference benchmark based on the existing service levels (for access, linehaul and egress trip legs) which is used in a computer aided personal interview instrument to generate future scenarios of service levels for current and prospective new modals options. We show that a fully integrated stated choice experiment provides all the information required to obtain behaviourally relevant parameter estimates (within a nested logit framework) for all but the mode-specific constants (MSCs). The MSCs can be calibrated for the current modes within a network model setting, giving the transport planner an appropriate model for predicting the patronage potential for proposed new public transport infrastructure services. A useful by-product is a new set of behavioural values of travel time savings for access, egress, linehaul and wait times. ...|$|R

The principal research objective for this study is to establish how successful Ottawa, Vancouver and Perth's transit systems have been and find out the overriding factors behind the success of the systems. This involves exploration of the following dimensions: urban form influence, transit network provision, best transit mode, and type of institutional arrangement. Ottawa, Vancouver and Perth have successfully introduced public transport systems into automobile-dominant communities. Ottawa is famous for its <b>busway</b> <b>system,</b> Vancouver is well known because of its development of the Skytrain (elevated LRT) and bus system, while Perth is renowned for its Northern Suburbs Rapid Transit System. An examination of Ottawa, Vancouver, and Perth suggests that advanced transit technology and transit-supportive land use patterns are not the factors critical to success. Instead, success is more closely related to: adoption of a `transit-first' investment strategy; the use of intermodal integration to create a multi-destination network; {{and the creation of a}} single transit authority to integrate services.

People throughput and freight throughput have become critical issues for California {{and the rest of the}} nation. PATH has been funding a one-year research project entitled "Definition and Evaluation of Bus and Truck Automation Operations Concepts," proposed by the authors. This report summarizes the results of the research project achieved during the first six months. During those six months, we reviewed literature and developed operating concepts for both urban bus automation and inter-city truck automation. We also selected a small number of most promising operating concepts for urban bus automation and inter-city truck automation, both with variations and intermediate deployment steps. On urban bus automation, we selected one unprotected automated <b>busway</b> <b>system</b> (ABUS) for city operations and two operating concepts for automated bus operations on or along a freeway. All or a subset of these three concepts can be integrated to form other operating concepts. On truck automation, we selected an operating concept for a protected inter-city truck-AHS. These concepts describe how automated systems involving buses or trucks operate as a system and how they interact with the surrounding transportation systems. These systems, if implemented, will revolutionize the current bus or truck transportation systems. They certainly cannot be achieved suddenly, and hence can be regarded as end-state systems. Since these end-state operating concepts re intended for real-world implementation and such implementation requires the participation of many stakeholders, any creditable end-state operating concept must be accompanied by and even justified with credible deployment sequences. We developed deployment sequences for these operating concepts to demonstrate the deployability of these concepts and to explain how to "get there from here. "...|$|E
40|$|Despite its {{potential}} multiple contributions to sustainable policy objectives, urban transit {{is generally not}} widely used by the public {{in terms of its}} market share compared to that of automobiles, particularly in affluent societies with low-density urban forms like Australia. Transit service providers need to attract more people to transit by improving transit quality of service. The key to cost-effective transit service improvements lies in accurate evaluation of policy proposals by taking into account their impacts on transit users. If transit providers knew what is more or less important to their customers, they could focus their efforts on optimising customer-oriented service. Policy interventions could also be specified to influence transit users’ travel decisions, with targets of customer satisfaction and broader community welfare. This significance motivates the research into the relationship between urban transit quality of service and its user perception as well as behaviour. This research focused on two dimensions of transit user’s travel behaviour: route choice and access arrival time choice. The study area chosen was a busy urban transit corridor linking Brisbane central business district (CBD) and the St. Lucia campus of The University of Queensland (UQ). This multi-system corridor provided a ‘natural experiment’ for transit users between the CBD and UQ, as they can choose between busway 109 (with grade-separate exclusive right-of-way), ordinary on-street bus 412, and linear fast ferry CityCat on the Brisbane River. The population of interest was set as the attendees to UQ, who travelled from the CBD or from a suburb via the CBD. Two waves of internet-based self-completion questionnaire surveys were conducted to collect data on sampled passengers’ perception of transit service quality and behaviour of using public transit in the study area. The first wave survey is to collect behaviour and attitude data on respondents’ daily transit usage and their direct rating of importance on factors of route-level transit quality of service. A series of statistical analyses is conducted to examine the relationships between transit users’ travel and personal characteristics and their transit usage characteristics. A factor-cluster segmentation procedure is applied to respodents’ importance ratings on service quality variables regarding transit route preference to explore users’ various perspectives to transit quality of service. Based on the perceptions of service quality collected from the second wave survey, a series of quality criteria of the transit routes under study was quantitatively measured, particularly, the travel time reliability in terms of schedule adherence. It was proved that mixed traffic conditions and peak-period effects can affect transit service reliability. Multinomial logit models of transit user’s route choice were estimated using route-level service quality perceptions collected in the second wave survey. Relative importance of service quality factors were derived from choice model’s significant parameter estimates, such as access and egress times, seat availability, and <b>busway</b> <b>system.</b> Interpretations of the parameter estimates were conducted, particularly the equivalent in-vehicle time of access and egress times, and busway in-vehicle time. Market segmentation by trip origin was applied to investigate the difference in magnitude between the parameter estimates of access and egress times. The significant costs of transfer in transit trips were highlighted. These importance ratios were applied back to quality perceptions collected as RP data to compare the satisfaction levels between the service attributes and to generate an action relevance matrix to prioritise attributes for quality improvement. An empirical study on the relationship between average passenger waiting time and transit service characteristics was performed using the service quality perceived. Passenger arrivals for services with long headways (over 15 minutes) were found to be obviously coordinated with scheduled departure times of transit vehicles in order to reduce waiting time. This drove further investigations and modelling innovations in passenger’ access arrival time choice and its relationships with transit service characteristics and average passenger waiting time. Specifically, original contributions were made in formulation of expected waiting time, analysis of the risk-aversion attitude to missing desired service run in the passengers’ access time arrivals’ choice, and extensions of the utility function specification for modelling passenger access arrival distribution, by using complicated expected utility forms and non-linear probability weighting to explicitly accommodate the risk of missing an intended service and passenger’s risk-aversion attitude. Discussions on this research’s contributions to knowledge, its limitations, and recommendations for future research are provided at the concluding section of this thesis...|$|E
