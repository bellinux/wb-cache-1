40|$|Abstract- This work {{is based}} on the {{analysis}} of engine <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket.</b> There are four <b>mounting</b> <b>brackets</b> to <b>mount</b> engine on vehicle chassis. Analysis is done for only one bracket and the results are considered for other three brackets. Due to the increase in global competitive market, automotive designs are pushed to the limits to decrease the cost {{and at the same time}} increase the stiffness to mass ratio and performance. Above all, the biggest constraint is to achieve all these with reduced design time. In order to get better designs, industries are using tools like FEM Optimization; these techniques are useful in designing the new shape and size with reduced design time. New Topology optimization tool is used in this work in designing engine <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> for analysis to get better design with less time. It also helps in the reduction of unwanted material and thereby mass of the component decreases respectively...|$|R

5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|R

The bracket applies the static loading to an electrical load cell symmetrically positioned between the bridge frame and the bracket.

The camera was in a <b>bracket</b> <b>mounted</b> on the front of their spacesuit, so they looked straight ahead at what they wanted to photograph; no viewfinder was needed.

In addition, by looking at the photographs in sequence, one can see that very often several of them were taken in rapid succession.

40|$|One of {{the main}} causes of {{vibration}} that produce by a car is engine and transmission. Engine and transmission location determination is an important thing that must be considered for a car. Method of locating engine and transmission will be proposed to determine the right position. This method depends to the size and type of engines. The project objective {{is to find a}} location for the engine <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> for a new car. It is important to reduce the vibration from the engine and transmission to the car’s body or chassis. These is also important to fit the engine bay before consider the component of engine clearance with component of body. The stress analysis is done for the location test, different thickness of side member, and different cross section of side member. The FEA software Algor is use for this analysis and Solidwork to modeling the side member. Five different cross section and design are use to analyze the location of the engine <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket.</b> The range location of the <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> is at the middle of the side member. This range depends to the packaging of the engine and the clearance between the components of engine with engine bay. Thickness of the side member also important to decrease the weight of the car and to minimize the stress value when load apply. For conclusion, not all the car has same location of <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> location and many thing must consider before determine this location.
