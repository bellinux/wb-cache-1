5|$|In Scotland, {{where she}} {{is also known as}} Beira, Queen of Winter, she is {{credited}} with making numerous mountains and large hills, which are said to have been formed when she was striding across the land and accidentally dropped rocks from her creel or wicker basket. In other cases she is said to have built the mountains intentionally, to serve as her stepping stones. She carries a hammer for shaping the hills and valleys, and is said to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> of all the goddesses and gods.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus {{had died}} in AD 19, in {{somewhat}} suspicious circumstances in Syria. Following his death, his wife Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with their six children and became increasingly involved {{with a group of}} senators who opposed the growing power of Sejanus. Her relations with Tiberius became increasingly fraught, as she made it clear that she believed that he was {{responsible for the death of}} Germanicus. The climate was further poisoned by the hatred that Tiberius' mother Livia Drusilla (the widow of Augustus) felt for her, since Agrippina's ambition, to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> of emperors and thus Rome's first woman, was an open secret. To Sejanus, Agrippina's sons Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar and Caligula were a threat to his power.|$|E

5|$|The deities {{associated}} with the Eye were not restricted to feline and serpent forms. Hathor's usual animal form is a cow, as {{is that of the}} closely linked Eye goddess Mehet-Weret. Nekhbet, a vulture goddess, was closely connected with Wadjet, the Eye, and the crowns of Egypt. Many Eye goddesses appear mainly in human form, including Neith, a sometimes warlike deity sometimes said to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> of the sun god, and Satet and Anuket, who were linked with the Nile cataracts and the inundation. Other such goddesses include Sothis, the deified form of the star of the same name, and Maat, the personification of cosmic order, who was connected with the Eye because she was said to be the daughter of Ra. Even Isis, who is usually the companion of Osiris rather than Ra, or Astarte, a deity of fertility and warfare who was imported from Canaan rather than native to Egypt, could be equated with the solar Eye.|$|E
5|$|Within {{attachment}} theory, Bowlby, in Attachment and Loss, volume one of Attachment (1969), {{makes it}} quite clear that infants become attached to carers who are sensitive and responsive in their social interactions with them and that this {{does not have to}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> or indeed a female. As a matter of social reality mothers are more often the primary carers of children and therefore {{are more likely to be}} the primary attachment figure, but the process of attachment applies to any carer and infants develop a number of attachments according to who relates to them and the intensity of the engagement. However, attachment theory relates to the development of attachment behaviours and relationships after about 7 months of age and there are other theories and research relating to earlier carer–infant interactions.|$|E

Maria's well lies on the Byrebank burn, in the Loudoun castle policies, which runs down near Loudoun Academy to join the Irvine.|$|E
25|$|To Leo the Great, Mariology is {{determined}} by Christology. If Christ were divine only, everything about him would be divine. Only his divinity would have been crucified, buried and resurrected. Mary would only <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> of God, and Christians would have no hope for their own resurrection. The nucleus of Christianity would be destroyed. The most unusual beginning of a truly human life through her was {{to give birth to}} Jesus, the Lord and Son of King David.|$|E

25|$|The two Marian dogmas of Immaculate Conception and Assumption were {{established}} by popes in the 19th and 20th century. Pope Pius XII issued the Dogma of the Assumption and the Second Vatican Council declared Mary to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mother</b> of the Church. In his 2002 Apostolic Letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae, Pope John Paul II emphasized Saint Louis de Montfort's approach of viewing {{the study of}} Mary as a path to gaining {{a better understanding of}} the mystery of Christ.|$|E
25|$|Southcott’s {{followers}} {{claimed she}} was a prophet and her sealed writings purported to reveal answers to world problems.

25|$|The cultus of Mary was not {{as strong}} in North Africa {{during the time of}} Augustine (354–430) as {{compared}} with that of recent martyrs. Augustine died the year before the Council of Ephesus in 431 declared Mary to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mother</b> of God, which prompted a more in depth consideration of Mary's role. He did not develop an independent Mariology, but his statements on Mary surpass in number and depths those of other early writers. His main themes are discussed in De santa virginitate (“On holy virginity”), where he explains that, like the church, Mary is both virgin and mother, both physically and spiritually.|$|E
25|$|Pre-eminent {{among the}} saints is the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God. In Orthodox theology, the Mother of God is the {{fulfillment}} of the Old Testament archetypes revealed in the Ark of the Covenant (because she carried the New Covenant {{in the person of}} Christ) and the burning bush that appeared before Moses (symbolizing the Mother of God's carrying of God without being consumed). Accordingly, the Orthodox consider Mary to be the Ark of the New Covenant and give her the respect and reverence as such. The Theotokos was chosen by God and she freely co-operated in that choice to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mother</b> of Jesus Christ, the God-man.|$|E
