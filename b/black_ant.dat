60|$|You may be {{sure that}} such a strange thing as a house for human beings to live in did not come into this wild wood without making quite a stir and {{excitement}} among the inhabitants that lived there before. All {{the time it was}} building, there was the greatest possible commotion in the breasts of all the older population; and there wasn't even a <b>black</b> <b>ant,</b> or a cricket, that did not have his own opinion about it, and did not tell the other ants and crickets just what he thought the world was coming to in consequence.|$|E
60|$|You figure her, I hope, {{with her}} white bundle, {{a sort of}} erect <b>black</b> <b>ant,</b> hurrying along the little white path-thread athwart the downland slopes under the {{hot sun of the}} summer afternoon. On she {{struggled}} after her resolute indefatigable nose, and the poppies in her bonnet quivered perpetually and her spring-side boots grew whiter and whiter with the downland dust. Flip-flap, flip-flap went her footfalls through the still heat of the day, and persistently, incurably, her umbrella sought to slip from under the elbow that retained it. The mouth wrinkle under her nose was pursed to an extreme resolution, and ever and again she told her umbrella to come up or gave her tightly clutched bundle a vindictive jerk. And at times her lips mumbled with fragments of some foreseen argument between herself and Skinner.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{examine the}} role of air quality in {{relation}} to chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, wheeze, and dry cough among adolescents from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods. A survey was administered on 6, 363 adolescents from 9 UAE regions. Data consists of demographic, socioeconomic, residential, and behavioural variables, such as location of residence, residing near industry/gas stations/dumpsites/construction sites, residing near overhead power line/plants, exposure to tobacco, residential exposure, ethnicity, concern over air pollution, smoking, and purposely smelling gasoline fumes/glue/correctors/car exhaust/burning <b>black</b> <b>ants.</b> Logistic regression modeling {{was used to determine}} significant predictors of respiratory health. Results. Asthma prevalence was 12. 3 %, followed by chronic bronchitis (1. 8 %) and emphysema (0. 5 %). Overall 12. 2 % reported wheeze and 34. 8 % reported a dry nocturnal cough in the past year. Multivariate analyses suggest that sex is a significant predictor of asthma and dry cough. Exposure to tobacco and arts/crafts/ceramics/stain is significant predictor of respiratory health. Tobacco smoking and purposely smelling gasoline fumes/glue/correctors/car exhaust/burning <b>black</b> <b>ants</b> are significant predictors of wheeze and dry cough. Conclusions. This study suggests that exposure to air quality and behavioral factors such as smoking and purposely smelling gasoline fumes, glue, correctors, car exhaust, or burning <b>black</b> <b>ants</b> are significant predictors of respiratory health among UAE adolescents...|$|R
6000|$|But {{little that}} troubled the magician. He began to mutter spells and strange words, {{and all of}} a sudden he was gone, and in his place was a great <b>black</b> <b>ant,</b> for he had changed himself into an ant. In he ran through a crack of the door (and {{mischief}} has got into many a man's house through a smaller hole for the matter of that). In and out ran the ant through one room and another, and up and down and here and there, until at last in a far-away part of the magic palace he found the three-legged stool, and if I had been in the soldier's place I would have chopped it up into kindling-wood after I had gotten all that I wanted. But there it was, and in an instant the magician resumed his own shape. Down he sat him upon the stool. [...] "I wish," [...] said he, [...] "that this palace and the princess and all who are within it, together with its orchards and its lawns and its gardens and everything, may be removed to such and such a country, upon the other side of the earth." ...|$|E
60|$|A <b>black</b> <b>ant</b> went {{in one day}} {{and made}} a tour of {{exploration}} up and down, over chairs and tables, up the ceilings and down again, and, coming out, wrote an article for the Crickets' Gazette, in which he described the new abode as a veritable palace. Several butterflies fluttered in and sailed about and were wonderfully delighted, and then a bumble-bee {{and two or three}} honey-bees, who expressed themselves well pleased with the house, but more especially enchanted with the garden. In fact, when {{it was found that the}} proprietors were very fond of the rural solitudes of Nature, and had come out there for the purpose of enjoying them undisturbed; that they watched and spared the anemones, and the violets, and bloodroots, and dog's- tooth violets, and little woolly rolls of fern that began to grow up under the trees in spring; that they never allowed a gun to be fired to scare the birds, and watched the building of their nests with the greatest interest,--then an opinion in favour of human beings began to gain ground, and every cricket and bird and beast was loud in their praise.|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Ebrard, {{who wrote}} a book about ants and their habits, tells a story of a little <b>black</b> <b>ant</b> who was {{building}} an arch at the foundation of a new ant-hill. It was necessary to have some means of supporting this arch, which was made of wet mud, until the key-stone should be put in and all made secure. The ant might have put up a couple of props, but this is not their habit in building. Their laws say nothing about props. But the arch must be supported, and so Mr. Ant thought {{that it would be a}} good idea to bend down a tall stalk of wheat which grew near the hill, and make it support the arch until it was finished. This he did by carrying bits of wet mud up to the end of the stalk until he had piled and stuck so much upon it that the heavy top bent over. But, as this was not yet low enough, and more mud could not be put on the slender stem without danger of breaking it, the ant crammed mud in between the stalk at its root and the other stalks, so that it was forced over still more. Then he used the lowered end to support his arch! ...|$|E
