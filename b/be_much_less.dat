5|$|Established {{traits are}} not immutable; traits that have high fitness in one {{environmental}} context may <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> fit if environmental conditions change. In {{the absence of}} natural selection to preserve such a trait, it becomes more variable and deteriorate over time, possibly resulting in a vestigial manifestation of the trait, also called evolutionary baggage. In many circumstances, the apparently vestigial structure may retain a limited functionality, or may be co-opted for other advantageous traits in a phenomenon known as preadaptation. A famous example of a vestigial structure, {{the eye of the}} blind mole-rat, is believed to retain function in photoperiod perception.|$|E
5|$|The real minimum memory {{requirements}} {{depend on}} the architecture and may <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> than the numbers listed in this table. It is possible to install Debian with 60MB of RAM for x86-64; the installer will run in low memory mode and it is recommended to create a swap partition. The installer for z/Architecture requires about 20MB of RAM, but relies on network hardware. Similarly, disk space requirements, which {{depend on the}} packages to be installed, can be reduced by manually selecting the packages needed. , no Pure Blend exists that would lower the hardware requirements easily.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of Sedna resurrected {{the question of}} which astronomical objects should be considered planets and which should not. On 15 March 2004, articles on Sedna in the popular press reported that a tenth planet had been discovered. This question was answered under the International Astronomical Union definition of a planet, adopted on 24 August 2006, which mandated that a planet must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Sedna has a Stern–Levison parameter estimated to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> than 1, and therefore cannot be considered to have cleared the neighborhood, even though no other objects have yet been discovered in its vicinity. To be a dwarf planet, Sedna must be in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is bright enough, and therefore large enough, that this {{is expected to be}} the case, and several astronomers have called it one.|$|E
5|$|That {{game was}} Computer Space, {{developed}} by Bushnell and Ted Dabney. They {{had found the}} Data General Nova, a US$4,000 computer that they thought would be powerful enough to run four games of Spacewar at once; the computer turned out to not actually be powerful enough for the project. While investigating the concept of replacing some of the computer with purpose-built hardware, however, the pair discovered that making a system explicitly for running such a game, rather than general programs, would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> expensive: as low as $100. By 1971 when Bushnell met with Pitts and Tuck, a prototype version had been successfully displayed {{for a short time}} in August 1971 in a local bar, the design was nearly finished, and the pair had founded a company around it called Syzygy. Bushnell had also found a manufacturer for the game, Nutting Associates, who would make the final game cabinets and sell them to distributors. Bushnell felt that Galaxy Game was not a real competitor to Computer Space, due to its high price. Pitts and Tuck believed, however, that despite the economic argument their game was superior, as they felt that Galaxy Game was a true expansion of Spacewar, while Computer Space just a pale imitation. Some players at the time, however, believed Galaxy Game to actually be just a version of Spacewar!. Galaxy Games prototype installation was very popular, though at a low price-per-game, and the pair developed a second version to display at the same location; they were never able to enter production, though, as they eventually had to abandon the idea after spending US$65,000 developing it due to the high cost and lack of business plan.|$|E

25|$|A later {{expedition}} by Vizcaíno {{with the}} same mission sailed on May 5, 1602 with four ships. This expedition was more fruitful. Ensenada, Baja California was founded.

25|$|These {{are simple}} {{to put up}} for {{temporary}} or field use. But they are also widely used by radio amateurs and short wave listeners in fixed locations due to their simple (and inexpensive) construction, while still realizing a resonant antenna at frequencies where resonant antenna elements need to be of quite some size. They are an attractive solution for these frequencies when significant directionality is not desired, {{and the cost of}} several such resonant antennas for different frequency bands, built at home, may still <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> than a single commercially produced antenna.|$|E

25|$|Jamming is {{problematic}} to radar since the jamming signal only needs to travel one way (from the jammer to the radar receiver) whereas the radar echoes travel two ways (radar-target-radar) {{and are therefore}} significantly reduced in power {{by the time they}} return to the radar receiver. Jammers therefore can <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> powerful than their jammed radars and still effectively mask targets along the line of sight from the jammer to the radar (mainlobe jamming). Jammers have an added effect of affecting radars along other lines of sight through the radar receiver's sidelobes (sidelobe jamming).|$|E
25|$|In Judaism, an hour {{is defined}} as 1/12 of the time from sunrise to sunset, so, during the winter, an hour can <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> than 60 minutes, and during the summer, it can be much more than 60 minutes. This {{proportional}} hour {{is known as a}} sha'ah z'manit (lit. a timely hour). A Jewish hour is divided into 1080 halakim (singular: helek) or parts. A part is 3⅓ seconds or 1/18 minute. The ultimate ancestor of the helek was a small Babylonian time period called a barleycorn, itself equal to 1/72 of a Babylonian time degree (1° of celestial rotation). These measures are not generally used for everyday purposes.|$|E
25|$|When the ligand {{is bound}} by FepA, the {{conformation}} of the N-terminal domain is changed {{so as to}} open the pore. There is controversy regarding how space is opened within the barrel to allow the ligand to pass through. Either the N-terminal plug domain remains within the barrel and undergoes conformational changes to create a pore or it temporarily drops out of the barrel. It has been hypothesized that it is energetically nonsensical to remove {{the whole of the}} N-terminal domain for translocation, because this requires the breakage of the salt bridges and numerous hydrogen bonds, however, since the barrel is water-filled, the energy required would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> than previously thought.|$|E
