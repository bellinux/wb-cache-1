5|$|The <b>Beginning</b> <b>or</b> the End (1947) is an American {{docudrama}} {{film about}} the development of the atomic bomb in World War II, directed by Norman Taurog, starring Brian Donlevy and Hume Cronyn, and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The film dramatizes the creation of the atomic bomb in the Manhattan Project and the bombing of Hiroshima.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the length}} of closure is {{defined in terms of}} time between the closure of the vocal tract after the {{preceding}} vowel, and the release before the following vowel, stops at the <b>beginning</b> <b>or</b> end of a word do not have a fortis-lenis contrast. Orthographically in Wagiman, word-initial stops are written using the voiced Roman letters (b, d and g), {{but at the end of}} a word, voiceless letters (p, t and k) are used instead.|$|E
5|$|The Bahá'í {{writings}} {{describe a}} single, personal, inaccessible, omniscient, omnipresent, imperishable, and almighty God {{who is the}} creator of all things in the universe. The existence of God and the universe {{is thought to be}} eternal, without a <b>beginning</b> <b>or</b> end. Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of creation, with a will and purpose that is expressed through messengers termed Manifestations of God.|$|E
5|$|This supreme, states Kaivalya Upanishad, is the eternal, the all-pervading, formless, unmanifest, infinite, inconceivable, {{one without}} <b>beginning</b> <b>or</b> middle or end, {{one which is}} chidananda ("consciousness-bliss"). He is, states the Upanishad, Brahman, Shiva, Indra, Vishnu, Prana (life force, breath), fire and moon (time, lunar calendar). Eternity is him, states the text, all that {{originated}} is him, all that originates is him. Know him, find liberation, {{there is no other}} way, states verse 9.|$|E

The games played include passing ten people in the line through a hula-hoop; if successful, those ten move straight {{to the beginning of}} the line.

5|$|Assonance, {{where the}} use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the <b>beginning</b> <b>or</b> end of a word, was widely used in skaldic poetry, but {{goes back to the}} Homeric epic. Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal {{elements}} of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry. Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Selvo's rule, he took over responsibility for the third construction of St. Mark's Basilica. This final and most famous version of the church, whose construction was begun by Domenico Contarini and finished by Vitale Faliero in 1094, remains an important symbol of the long periods of medieval Venetian wealth and power. The church is also {{a monument to the}} great Byzantine influence on Venetian art and culture throughout its history, but particularly in the 11th century. Though Selvo did not oversee the <b>beginning</b> <b>or</b> completion of St Mark's Basilica, his rule covered a longer period of its construction than the other two Doges who oversaw the project.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} The <b>Beginning</b> <b>or</b> the End {{originated}} in October 1945 with actress Donna Reed, and {{her high school}} science teacher, Edward R. Tompkins, a chemist at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. According to The Hollywood Reporter issues of December 1945 and January 1946, MGM, Paramount and 20th Century-Fox were all interested in making a film about the Manhattan Project. Paramount's Hal B. Wallis was already working on his own version, titled Top Secret, but agreed to merge his project with MGM's and hand over his story and research, offering {{to serve as an}} adviser on the MGM treatment in return for a fixed fee and a percentage of the box office gross.|$|E
5|$|The {{second factor}} {{is the value of}} protection: would the plant be less able to survive and {{reproduce}} after removal of part of its structure by a herbivore? Not all plant parts are of equal evolutionary value, thus valuable parts contain more defenses. A plant’s stage of development at the time of feeding also affects the resulting change in fitness. Experimentally, the fitness value of a plant structure is determined by removing that part of the plant and observing the effect. In general, reproductive parts are not as easily replaced as vegetative parts, terminal leaves have greater value than basal leaves, and the loss of plant parts mid-season has a greater negative effect on fitness than removal at the <b>beginning</b> <b>or</b> end of the season. Seeds in particular tend to be very well protected. For example, the seeds of many edible fruits and nuts contain cyanogenic glycosides such as amygdalin. This results from the need to balance the effort needed to make the fruit attractive to animal dispersers while ensuring that the seeds are not destroyed by the animal.|$|E
5|$|In 1930 the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} the West Indies which included four Test matches—the first Tests to be played in the West Indies. The MCC side was not at full international strength; it included players who were either just <b>beginning</b> <b>or</b> just ending their international careers, and several star English bowlers were missing. The first Test was played in Barbados and Headley was selected, making his debut for the West Indies on 11 February 1930—to the disapproval of some Barbadians who thought his place should have gone to a local player. Batting at number three, he played aggressively in the first innings but the crowd barracked him and he was bowled for 21. However, in the second innings he scored 176, becoming the first West Indian to score a century on his Test debut and only their second centurion overall. He shared century partnerships with both Clifford Roach and Frank de Caires, but these were insufficient to force victory, and the match was drawn. Headley remained in the Test side {{for the rest of the}} series, the only home player other than Roach to appear in all four Tests. In Trinidad, during the second Test, Headley found the unfamiliar conditions difficult—Trinidad was the only Test match ground in the Caribbean which was played on a pitch made from matting instead of grass. Headley scored eight and 39 as West Indies lost the match. The home side levelled the series with their first ever Test victory in the third match of the series, played in British Guiana. In this match Headley became the first West Indian, and only the fifth cricketer of any nation, to score two separate hundreds in a Test match. His first innings of 114 was played mainly in support of Roach, who scored a double century. In the second innings, Headley scored 112 as West Indies batted with a big first innings lead, attacking defensive English bowling.|$|E

5|$|In 1930 the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} the West Indies which included four Test matches—the first Tests to be played in the West Indies. The MCC side was not at full international strength; it included players who were either just <b>beginning</b> <b>or</b> just ending their international careers, and several star English bowlers were missing. The first Test was played in Barbados and St Hill was selected, making his debut for the West Indies on 11 February 1930. He scored 0 and 12 with the bat, took two for 110 from 35 overs in the first innings and was wicketless in the second. The match was drawn. The MCC then travelled to Trinidad and played the cricket team in two games. St Hill played in the first, taking four wickets, but was rested from the second. The Trinidad Sporting Chronicle stated that he was omitted specifically to be ready for the second Test, also played in Trinidad, although he had not asked for a rest. The newspaper questioned why he had then been left out of the team for the Test match, and reported speculation that his omission was for political reasons to discredit the leadership of George Dewhurst, the Trinidad captain in the second game. It suggested that, given his ability with bat and ball, St Hill was worth a net 100 runs to any team in which he played. Having been omitted from the second Test, which West Indies lost, St Hill played in the third in British Guiana. West Indies won the game; St Hill batted at number eleven in the batting order in his first innings, at number five in the second and scored three runs in each innings. With the ball, he took only one wicket and did not play another Test. A review of the series in the Barbados Advocate suggested that St Hill bowled steadily during both his Test appearances, but that his economical bowling figures in British Guiana were slightly unrepresentative as the English batsmen had been concentrating entirely on defence. The article stated that St Hill was more effective on matting pitches than on turf, but that he had many supporters in Trinidad. It believed he warranted a place on the forthcoming West Indian tour of Australia, but that he needed to work on his fielding, which was weak.|$|E
