40|$|Abstract—This article {{presents}} a newly developed robotized palletizer control configuration {{consisting of a}} graphical application running on a human-machine interface (HMI) touch screens, a PLC program, and a servo system that executes palletizer reconfiguration and makes high-speed robotic palletizing possible. The servo system of the palletizer allows the PLC to reconfigure the palletizer automatically, based on the configuration data, and to control the product feed to the robots that execute the palletizing function. This allows the robots to handle several boxes {{at a time and}} therefore achieve high-speed palletizing. Significant downtime reduction during <b>batch</b> <b>changes</b> is achieved due to simplification of operator tasks, which makes the configuration and control method ideally suitable for production environments with frequent <b>batch</b> <b>changes.</b> Packaging and materials handling industries may be financially benefited using this configuration and control method. These include low palletizer downtime, high palletizer throughput, low training costs, no rework due to configuration errors and wider availability of potential operators...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of how to parallelize the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method has received much attention in the literature. In this paper, we focus instead on batch methods that use a sizeable fraction of the training set at each iteration to facilitate parallelism, and that employ second-order information. In order to improve the learning process, we follow a multi-batch approach in which the <b>batch</b> <b>changes</b> at each iteration. This can cause difficulties because L-BFGS employs gradient differences to update the Hessian approximations, and when these gradients are computed using different data points the process can be unstable. This paper shows how to perform stable quasi-Newton updating in the multi-batch setting, illustrates the behavior of the algorithm in a distributed computing platform, and studies its convergence properties for both the convex and nonconvex cases.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{modelling}} and simulating pipelines {{that are used}} for transporting different fluids is addressed in the paper. The problem is solved by including fluid density in the model beside pressure and velocity of the medium. First, the system of nonlinear partial differential equations is derived. Then, the obtained model is linearised and transformed into the transfer function form with three inputs and three outputs. Four different forms of model description are presented in the paper. Since transfer functions are transcendent, they cannot be simulated using classical tools. Rational transfer function approximation of the model was found and that simple model was validated on the real industrial pipeline. It was also compared to the model that does not take the changes in fluid density into account. The latter model cannot cope with <b>batch</b> <b>changes</b> whereas the proposed one can. © 2003 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

After the addition of COD both system had increased percentage removal of nitrate. COD:N 03 ratios applied here with external carbon (16 : 1 minimum) were higher than the experimental 7 : 1 {{reported in the literature}} for complete denitrification.

Considering medium/low volumes and a wide set of different models, a mixed model assembly work cell is a proper automated production system.

30|$|The {{objectives}} of the experiments were to show whether {{it was possible to}} detect process contamination using the BonNDTinspect system as well as whether these contaminations can be differentiated with reference to their concentration and whether a conclusion can be drawn based on the result of wetting on the adhesiveness. The experiments carried out clarify that {{it is not possible to}} differentiate between the standard evaluation criteria such as the average droplet size, the wetting proportion, and the possibility of differentiating highly concentrated amounts of release agent. The effect of the spinodal dewetting of the release agent requires an extension of the evaluation criteria by the mode and the roundness. Furthermore, the experiments showed that a reference investigation with appropriate adaptation of the limit values is necessary in the case of a <b>batch</b> <b>change</b> of the resin system. The BonNDTinspect method can be used to detect surface contamination such as release agents, CFRP dust, and fingerprints. In the case of contamination with corundum, it is impossible to make a statement about the nature of the surface using the selected conditions. As can be seen from the evaluation criteria mean droplet diameter, the roundness, and the mode, the BonNDTinspect-system showed good sensitivity to all contaminations.|$|E

Using a whole-genome microarray, we studied the expression profile of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves after oviposition by two pierid butterflies. For Pieris brassicae, the deposition of egg <b>batches</b> <b>changed</b> the expression of hundreds of genes {{over a period of}} 3 d after oviposition. The transcript signature was similar to that observed during a hypersensitive response or in lesion-mimic mutants, including the induction of defense and stress-related genes and the repression of genes involved in growth and photosynthesis. Deposition of single eggs by Pieris rapae caused a similar although much weaker transcriptional response. Analysis of the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid mutants coi 1 - 1 and sid 2 - 1 indicated that the response to egg deposition is mostly independent of these signaling pathways. Histochemical analyses showed that egg deposition is causing a localized cell death, accompanied by the accumulation of callose, and the production of reactive oxygen species. In addition, activation of the pathogenesis-related 1 ::beta-glucuronidase reporter gene correlated precisely with the site of egg deposition and was also triggered by crude egg extract. This study provides molecular evidence for the detection of egg deposition by Arabidopsis plants and suggests that oviposition causes a localized response with strong similarity to a hypersensitive response...|$|R

40|$|Soft sensors {{based on}} multivariate {{statistical}} models are used very frequently for the monitoring of batch processes. From {{the moment of}} model calibration onward, the model is usually assumed to be time-invariant. Unfortunately, batch process conditions are subject to several events that make the correlation structure between <b>batches</b> <b>change</b> with respect {{to that of the}} original model. This can determine a decay of the soft sensor performance, unless periodic maintenance (i. e., updating) of the model is carried out. This article proposes a methodology for the automatic maintenance of PLS soft sensors in batch processing. Whereas the adaptation scheme usually follows chronological order in classical recursive updating, the proposed strategy defines the reference data set for model recalibration as the set of batches (nearest neighbors) that are most similar to the currently running batch. The nearest neighbors to a running batch are identified during the initial evolution of the batch following a concept of proximity in the latent space of principal components. In this way, for any new batch to be run, a model can be tailored on the running batch itself. The effectiveness of the proposed updating methodology is evaluated in two case studies related to the development of adaptive soft sensors for real-time product quality monitoring: a simulated fed-batch process for the production of penicillin and an industrial batch polymerization process for the production of a resin...|$|R
