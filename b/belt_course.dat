5|$|The end bays of {{the west}} (main) facade are framed in pedimented pavilions, which have {{recessed}} brick panels above the impost line, and below it are bricks coursed to resemble rustication. One glazed roundel is at the middle of each tympanum. The pedimented central bay has an arched recessed entrance {{with a pair of}} oversized double wood doors beneath a fanlight. The arch is flanked with blind roundels above the impost line, with rustication below. The bay's tympanum is undecorated. The arch impost line continues as a <b>belt</b> <b>course</b> between the pavilions and forms the sills for recessed wood-framed, fixed-sashed, nine-light windows on the building's second level. The windows are divided by Doric pilasters.|$|E
5|$|Designed by William R. Walker & Son and {{constructed}} by S. Mason & H. A. Smith in 1886, the one story red brick Queen Anne style building is basically rectangular with a low-pitched hipped roof. The red bricks are laid in dark red mortar and is contrasted by the granite sill course and brownstone <b>belt</b> <b>course</b> at window sill level. The building has a central closed entry pavilion which projects out {{and has two}} porches oriented to face Mulberry and Cedar Street. The building has three lunette windows {{on the sides of}} the main block, each divided into thirds, and a smaller windows on the pavilion's pedimented end. The rear ell has double hung two-over-two sash windows. At the time of the nomination, during the renovations to a single family home, the house had its Cedar Street porch closed in with plywood and the smaller lunette windows were boarded in, but the exterior wooden trim was largely extant.|$|E
5|$|The Blackstone is a 22-floor {{rectangular}} {{structure and}} its structural steel frame is cased in tile and plaster fireproofing. On the exterior {{south and east}} (front) elevations is a one-story base of pink granite, with high arched openings; it supports the red brick- and terra cotta-trimmed building shaft. Above the granite base are four stories of white, glazed terra cotta. The large windows of {{the second and third}} floor, which once poured natural light into the lobby, ballroom, and restaurants, have mostly been covered for a theater. The majority of the building rises as a 12-story shaft of red brick dotted with white, terra cotta window surrounds; above this section is a <b>belt</b> <b>course</b> of terra cotta and two stories of red brick. Above this, the original design included an intermediate terra cotta cornice topped by a cast-iron railing. This has been removed and replaced with red brick and white glazed brick, flush {{with the rest of the}} building. The mansard roof was originally decorated with small spires around the perimeter, and 2 very tall flagpoles.|$|E

5000|$|The {{east and}} west {{profiles}} have projecting bays with staircased entries. On the east it is centered with an arched window similar to those on the auditorium wing between two cast-stone <b>belt</b> <b>courses</b> and framed with some slightly projecting bricks. On the west end, a small flat-roofed extension projects to the south, and the [...] consists of a row of five smaller arch windows between darker <b>belt</b> <b>courses.</b> The south elevation has windows in all ten bays on both stories.|$|R
25|$|Other new {{construction}} continued in previously established styles. In 1911 and 1913 respectively, new brick commercial buildings went up at 189 and 205 Main in the Renaissance Revival style. Their application differed {{from those that}} had gone before. On 189 was a <b>belt</b> <b>course</b> and stone quoins; on the other building all the decoration, including the flat-arched lintels and corbeled cornice, was brick.|$|E
500|$|The {{church is}} chiefly {{built out of}} red brick, with a <b>belt</b> <b>course</b> and a parapet of Bedford stone. [...] Light tan brick is used for {{decorative}} patterns and embellishments.|$|E
2500|$|The Lakeview Depot was {{designed}} by Frederick J. DeLongchamps, a well known regional architect with offices in San Francisco and Reno. [...] The depot was constructed by I. A. (Andy) Underwood, a prominent Lakeview builder. [...] The depot is a two-story Mission Revival style structure with some Prairie School architectural influences. [...] It is a brick masonry structure built on a concrete foundation with a footprint measuring [...] by [...] [...] The depot has a hip roof, covered with tin sheets stamped to look like mission tiles. [...] The structure has wide overhanging eaves supported by large triangular brackets set in pairs. [...] There is an arcade style pavilion attached to {{the south end of}} the building. [...] The pavilion is covered by curvilinear gable typical of the California Mission style. [...] The banks of windows under the overhanging eaves and a prominent <b>belt</b> <b>course</b> of masonry high on the exterior walls are typical of the Prairie School architecture. [...] These exterior features are all common characteristics of railroad passenger stations constructed during the period just prior to World War I.|$|E
50|$|The façade is of red {{pressed brick}} with cut stone piers and <b>belt</b> <b>courses</b> {{up to the}} third floor, and {{finished}} at the top story with arched opening which agreeably relieves the otherwise somewhat rigid and austere treatment of the windows.|$|R
5000|$|The church {{building}} was constructed from 1867 to 1870. It is a Gothic Revival built of dressed dolomite. [...] It {{is dominated by}} a tall, square, crenelated corner tower. It rises in three stages, which are separated by <b>belt</b> <b>courses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{reflects a}} mix of Victorian and Romanesque Revival influences. The facades, with vertical pilasters and horizontal <b>belt</b> <b>courses</b> creating a grid, reflect Victorian compositional strategies. Details such as the round arches over groups of windows and the arched main entrance and corner entrance are Romanesque Revival elements.|$|R
2500|$|Mount Airy is {{composed}} of a massive two-story central block above a high basement, [...] long and [...] deep, two curving one-story passageways, and two -square two-story end dependencies set forward. [...] The five-part unit, [...] long, encloses three sides of a semi-circular forecourt. This court is raised by a low terrace above the entrance drive and is reached by cut and molded stone steps, flanked by elaborate carved stone vases on pedestals. Set on a ridge, the house commands a wide view of the Rappahannock River Valley. The [...] walls of the central unit are made of dark-brown sandstone, carefully hewn and laid in courses of random height, with architectural trim in light-colored limestone. It {{is possible that the}} exterior may originally have been stuccoed though no trace remains. The north or entrance façade is approached from the forecourt by a flight of steps leading to a recessed loggia, whose square columns, faced with four Roman Doric pilasters, define three rectilinear openings. The projecting central pavilion is of rusticated limestone, with three windows in the second story and a crowning pediment. The south or garden facade is almost identical in composition except that the three entrances in the pavilion are spanned by round arches with heavily marked voussoirs and keystones, and the upper windows are unframed. The other windows are framed by stone architraves and sills, and the limestone <b>belt</b> <b>course</b> and rusticated angle quoins are very prominent. The existing broad hip roof, pierced by four interior chimneys located near the ridge, is a replacement of the original roof, possibly a hip-on-hip that was destroyed by fire in 1844.|$|E
50|$|The ground-floor windows—situated by the caretaker's {{apartment}} at {{the northwest corner}} and across the rear façade—have shallow segmental arches. The sills of the second-story windows form a continuous <b>belt</b> <b>course</b> of sandstone. These sash windows are topped by jack arches with upwardly protruding keystones. Above this is another <b>belt</b> <b>course</b> and a dentilled cornice.|$|E

50|$|Hotel Oregon, {{also known}} as Oakman Drugs, Oakman Glass, and Spartan Hotel, is a {{historic}} hotel building located at Spartanburg, Spartanburg County, South Carolina. It was built in 1909, and is a three-story, brick building with two first floor storefronts. It features horizontal granite <b>belt</b> <b>courses,</b> decorative brick panels, brick cornices, and a stepped front parapet.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse is an {{excellent}} example of Second Renaissance Revival architecture. This style conveyed the dignity of government and was often used for civic buildings during the late nineteenth century. Some of the hallmarks of the Renaissance Revival style found on the building include a prominent cornice, balustrades, and quoins (corner blocks). <b>Belt</b> <b>courses,</b> another common feature, encircle the building at each level.|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} the steeple's four stages has corner buttresses and two stone <b>belt</b> <b>courses,</b> the upper one serving as the springline for the quatrefoiled transom over the main {{entrance}} on the south side. Another course, slightly flared, {{marks the beginning of}} the next stage, with a narrow lancet window {{in the center of each}} side. Each has diamond glass and some vergeboard in the arch.|$|R
50|$|It was {{designed}} by Topeka architect George Ropes. It is a two-story-with-basement red brick building with a 110 x 60 ft plan and height almost 65 ft. Its foundation is a native limestone wall, separated from brick above by a smooth cut stone <b>belt</b> <b>course.</b> A second <b>belt</b> <b>course</b> circles the building at level of the second story's window sills.|$|E
50|$|The <b>belt</b> <b>course</b> often {{projects}} {{from the}} side of the building. Georgian architecture is notable for the use of belt courses.|$|E
50|$|Although the <b>belt</b> <b>course</b> has {{its origins}} as a {{structural}} {{component of a}} building, by the 18th century it was almost purely a decorative element and had no functional purpose. In brick or stone buildings taller than three stories, however, a shelf angle is usually used to transfer the load of the wall to a hidden, interior steel wall. Flashing is used to cover the space exposed by the shelf angle to help limit the intrusion of water. Where flashing is considered aesthetically unpleasing, a <b>belt</b> <b>course</b> is often used.|$|E
50|$|The two-story, frame, front gabled, Colonial Revival {{house is}} {{symmetrical}} in plan, {{with the exception}} of the wrap-around porch. It features Georgian corner pilasters, pedimented dormers, wooden <b>belt</b> <b>courses,</b> anAdamesque-style cornice with dentils and decorative modillions, and an elliptical fanlight. The porch features columns in the Doric order and a plain dentilled cornice. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.|$|R
5000|$|This {{section of}} the {{district}} also includes the Lake Linden Village Hall and Fire Station (1901). The Hall is a two-story Richardsonian Romanesque structure on a rough sandstone base. [...] The first story is constructed of red brick, with lighter brick above; <b>belt</b> <b>courses</b> run between floors and above the windows. The doorways and windows are arched, and an octagonal cupola sits atop the structure.|$|R
25|$|There {{are four}} stages to the bell tower, all {{set off by}} smooth-finished <b>belt</b> <b>courses.</b> Its corner buttresses {{continue}} to the top, gradually changing from square to circular as they do and {{becoming part of the}} crowning parapet along with a small pediment on each side. The stages are fenestrated, from top to bottom, with a single lancet arched window, double lancet-arched windows, a diamond panel and louvered Gothic window.|$|R

2500|$|The second Williams Block {{was five}} stories tall, divided into bays {{containing}} three windows per floor; each floor had slightly different window shapes. [...] The building was constructed of brick, sheathed {{on the front}} with sandstone. [...] A cast iron cornice and flat roof topped the structure. [...] <b>Belt</b> <b>courses</b> were located above and below windows, and additional decoration consisted of bas relief carvings and cast iron entabulatures.|$|R
50|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>courses</b> {{encircle}} the building, delineating {{the interior}} floors. A distinctive cornice, which echoes the arched {{shape of the}} windows on {{the first and second}} stories, is topped by a slate roof. The roof form is primarily hipped, crossed by central gable parapet-wall dormers and terminated at each end with octagonal turrets. Entrance to the building is gained through a large, central Romanesque arch on the Phillips Street facade.|$|R
50|$|The Garden Court Apartments is an H-shaped {{building}} standing nine stories {{tall with}} a symmetrical façade facing Jefferson Avenue. The lowest two stories {{are faced with}} limestone, while {{the remainder of the}} building is made from red brick. Two rounded bay window units rise the full nine stories. The top story has limestone <b>belt</b> <b>courses</b> and window surrounds, and a balustrade runs {{along the edge of the}} flat roof.|$|R
50|$|The {{materials}} {{and design of}} the one-story rear addition, built in 1932-1933, generally match the original building. The west elevation continues the rusticated pilasters and projecting <b>belt</b> <b>course,</b> but is terminated by a flat, stone parapet at the second-story level.|$|E
50|$|The half-block {{east and}} west elevations, {{identical}} to each other, have eight fenestration bays and pairs of one-story entry doors located {{toward the center of}} each elevation. The Greek key <b>belt</b> <b>course</b> and carved frieze and cornice continue from the front facade.|$|E

50|$|On the 13-bay south (front) facade, the five-bay {{projecting}} entrance pavilion, {{itself with}} the center three bays projecting, is complemented by two lesser projections on {{the third and fourth}} bays from the center. Bricks are laid in stretcher bond. Stone <b>belt</b> <b>courses</b> provide sills and lintels the narrow one-over-one double-hung sash windows on the first story. Segmental arches of vertical brick, with keystones, spring from the lintels on the flanking projections.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} stages to the bell tower, all {{set off by}} smooth-finished <b>belt</b> <b>courses.</b> Its corner buttresses {{continue}} to the top, gradually changing from square to circular as they do and {{becoming part of the}} crowning parapet along with a small pediment on each side.
