40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines {{are used in}} many applications. The same engine type may have different components mounted to it depending upon its use. These engine mounted components need to be designed against fatigue in order to withstand the engine vibrations. Measured engine vibrations are commonly used as input data for fatigue estimation. The focus in this thesis is set on heavy-duty diesel engines, typically used in trucks, buses and industrial applications. All of the appended papers use engine vibration measurements to evaluate the proposed methods. In Paper A, the engine block motion is described with a seven degree of freedom kinematic model. These degrees of freedom consist of six rigid body modes and one assumed twisting degree of freedom. With this description, measured engine block vibrations {{can be used to}} accurately predict the vibration in positions that have not been measured. Relating the measured vibrations of an engine mounted component with the projected motion of the engine block at that same position, makes it possible to identify local dynamic phenomena. In Paper B, the kinematic model of Paper A is extended with three assumed bending deformation mode shapes. For the current engine type, all of the assumed deformation modes are ranked within the 10 - 300 Hz frequency range. The deformation mode of highest importance is the engine block twist. Including bending deformation increases the accuracy of the engine block vibration description but it also increases the demands on instrumentation. In Paper C, the possibility to modify measured engine vibration signals, for addition or removal of engine mounted components, is investigated. For this purpose, engine vibration measurements were performed with and without a 29 kg <b>brake</b> <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> mounted to the engine. For the task of removing the effect that this engine mounted component has on the engine block, the two cases of knowing, and not knowing the vibration of the component are both considered. The proposed methodology successfully predicts the changes in engine vibration due to system modification. The proposed method {{can also be used to}} estimate the time response of a component's centre of gravity. In this study the component's dynamic properties are derived from measurements but they could also be produced using finite element analysis. This can be useful early in the design process to find critically stressed areas due to base excitation. QC 20171222 </p...|$|E

50|$|Flivver Lo-Vs were {{arranged}} in mixed trains consisting of trailers and motor cars. While trailer cars were equipped with <b>brakes,</b> but no <b>air</b> <b>compressors</b> or motors, motor cars were equipped with all three. The Flivvers {{were part of}} the first generation of Lo-V subway cars, along with the first Steinways. Flivvers utilized parts from the IRT Composites, which were being modified at the time to provide service on the IRT's Manhattan and Bronx elevated lines beginning in 1916.|$|R
5000|$|However, <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> can be {{made much}} more {{effective}} than vacuum brakes for a given size of <b>brake</b> cylinder. An <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> <b>compressor</b> is usually capable of generating a pressure of [...] vs only [...] for vacuum. With a vacuum system, the maximum pressure differential is atmospheric pressure ( [...] at sea level, less at altitude). Therefore, an <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system can use a much smaller brake cylinder than a vacuum system to generate the same braking force. This advantage of <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> increases at high altitude, e.g. Peru and Switzerland where today vacuum brakes are used by secondary railways. The much higher effectiveness of <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> and {{the demise of the}} steam locomotive have seen the <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> become ubiquitous; however, vacuum braking is still in use in India, in Argentina and in South Africa, but this will be declining in near future.|$|R
50|$|The design {{used the}} same boiler as the Nord's first 4-6-2 Pacifics, the 3.1150 series; they had Belpaire fireboxes, a steam dome on the first boiler ring, and a sandbox on the second. The boiler has 90 Serve tubes, and a 24-element Schmidt superheater. They were fitted with Nord's {{variable}} exhaust. While they were delivered with vacuum brakes, they were all retro-fitted with Westinghouse <b>air</b> <b>brakes,</b> the <b>compressor</b> being sited on the left-hand side.|$|R
5000|$|Acquisitions continued. In January 1963, Midland-Ross {{acquired}} the J. Leukart Machine Company of Columbus, Ohio, manufacturer of precision machining equipment. In April, it {{acquired the}} Steel City Electric Co. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, {{a manufacturer of}} electrical cables, junction boxes, and other industrial electrical equipment. That same year, it changed the name of its Midland Brake division to Power Controls. The company had significantly diversified its product line, and now primarily manufactured <b>air</b> and vacuum <b>brake</b> systems, <b>air</b> <b>compressors,</b> <b>brake</b> valves, treadles, and slack adjustors. By 1965, Midland-Ross' sales had risen to a record $210 million ($ in [...] dollars). In February of that year, it acquired National Malleable and Steel Castings Co. (a company which made grinding balls, iron and steel castings, and railway equipment) for $30 million ($ in [...] dollars). The purchase included two subsidiaries, Industrial Castings (an iron and steel casting manufacturer) and Capitol Foundry (maker of steel grinding balls for the mining industry).|$|R
50|$|Truck (lorry) horns may be {{electrically}} operated and similar to car horns, but are often air horns driven by air from an <b>air</b> <b>compressor,</b> which many trucks have {{in order to}} operate the <b>air</b> <b>brakes.</b> The <b>compressor</b> forces <b>air</b> past a diaphragm in the horn's throat, causing it to vibrate. Such air horns are often used as trim items, with chromed straight horns mounted {{on top of the}} cab. This design may also be installed on customised automobiles, using a small electrical compressor. Usually two or more are used, some drivers {{go so far as to}} install train horns. The frequencies vary to produce a variety of different chords, but in general are lower than those of automobile horns—125-180 Hz (approximately C₃-G₃). Sound levels are approximately 117-118 decibels.|$|R

50|$|Following {{the success}} of the first six petrol railcars, Sentetsu put another 21 into service in the next two years, with the Gyeongseong Works {{delivering}} eleven (numbered 15 through 25) in 1931 and ten more in 1932 (numbered 26 through 35). These were also powered by the Waukesha 6RB engine and seated 100, but they were shorter than the first six cars. The passenger compartment was heated by hot water pipes connected to a boiler in the goods compartment. They were equipped with both <b>air</b> and hand <b>brakes,</b> and the <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> had a multiple V-belt drive. Driving cabs were located {{at both ends of the}} railcar. It is not known what their new numbers and classification became in Sentetsu's 1938 general renumbering, but some eventually were numbered in the 70-79 range.|$|R

5000|$|Lo-Vs were {{arranged}} in mixed trains consisting of trailer cars and motor cars. While trailer cars were equipped with <b>brakes,</b> but no <b>air</b> <b>compressors</b> or motors, motor cars were equipped with all three. [...] "Lo-V" [...] {{is short for}} [...] "Low Voltage" [...] which refers to the cars' form of propulsion control. Earlier Composite and [...] "Hi-V" [...] (High Voltage) equipment that ran on the IRT had utilized a 600 volt DC circuit that ran directly through the motorman's master controller to control the car's propulsion. The 600 volts was also trainlined through the whole train {{by the use of}} high voltage jumper cables which had to be run between cars. However, Lo-V equipment used battery voltage (32 volts) in the motor control circuit to move high voltage (600 volt) contacts underneath the car, which would control the car's propulsion. Likewise, it would no longer be necessary to use 600 volt jumpers between the cars. This tremendously improved safety of the equipment for both train crews and shop personnel alike.|$|R

5000|$|The US Patent and Trademark Office {{assigned}} , , and [...] for the design. The locomotive and railcar bodies, {{and interior}} fittings, were built by Pullman-Standard. The Electro-Motive Company (EMC) developed the electric propulsion system {{driven by the}} Winton engine. As was their practice as a system engineering firm at the time, they contracted manufacture {{of the components of}} their systems to primary equipment manufacturers. General Motors' Cleveland subsidiary, the [...] Winton Engine Company, provided the prime mover. The <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> <b>compressor,</b> main generator, traction motors and control equipment were manufactured by the General Electric Company. Skepticism that development efforts for Diesel motors underway in the early 1930s would yield to timely release of an engine adequate for high speed rail service led to use of a spark-ignition distillate engine. Trucks were strongly influenced by German passenger bogie design, as investigated by Union Pacific chief engineer A.H. Fetters.|$|R

5000|$|The main {{competitor}} to the <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> is {{the vacuum}} brake, which operates on negative pressure.

5000|$|The Westinghouse <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system. In this system, air {{reservoirs}} are provided on every vehicle and the locomotive charges the train pipe {{with a positive}} air pressure, which releases the vehicle brakes and charges the {{air reservoirs}} on the vehicles. If the driver applies the brakes, his <b>brake</b> valve releases <b>air</b> from the train pipe, and triple valves at each vehicle detect the pressure loss and admit air from the <b>air</b> reservoirs to <b>brake</b> cylinders, applying the brakes. The Westinghouse system uses smaller <b>air</b> reservoirs and <b>brake</b> cylinders than the corresponding vacuum equipment, because a moderately high air pressure can be used. However, an <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> is required to generate the compressed air and in the earlier days of railways, this required a large reciprocating steam <b>air</b> <b>compressor,</b> and this was regarded by many engineers as highly undesirable.|$|R
