40|$|In {{the modern}} global economy, {{there is a}} demand for high {{precision}} in manufacture as competitive pressures drive businesses to seek greater productivity. This results in a demand for {{a reduction in the}} errors associated with CNC machine tools. To this end, it is useful to develop a greater understanding of the mechanisms which give rise to errors in machine tool drives. This programme of research covers the geometric, thermal and load errors commonly encountered on CNC machine tools. Several mathematical models have been developed or extended which enable {{a deeper understanding of the}} interaction between these errors, various details of <b>ballscrew</b> design and the dynamic behaviour of <b>ballscrew</b> driven systems. Some useful models based on the discrete matter or “lumped mass” approach have been devised. One extends the classical eigenvalue method for finding the natural frequencies and other dynamic characteristics of <b>ballscrew</b> systems to include viscous damping effects using a generalised eigenvalue approach. This gives the damping coefficient of each predicted vibration mode along with the estimates of the natural frequencies, enabling many of the natural frequencies predicted by standard undamped natural frequency analyses to be dismissed as being of little consequence to the vibratory behaviour of the system. A development of this modelling method gives the sensitivity of the system to changes in stiffness and damping characteristics, which is helpful at the preliminary design stage of a <b>ballscrew</b> system, and is an aid in deciding the most convenient remedy to vibration problems which may occur in service. The second set of lumped-mass models is specially developed to take account of the changes in the configuration of the system with time as the nut moves along the screw while taking into account the non-linear phenomena of backlash and Coulomb friction. These can deal with the axial, torsional and transverse degrees of freedom of the system and predict many aspects of the dynamic behaviour of a <b>ballscrew</b> system which have an effect on the errors arising from such systems. They also include features which calculate the energy converted to heat by all the energy dissipative mechanisms in the model which can be used in conjunction with models already developed at the University of Huddersfield to predict thermal errors. Further, a strategy for compensation of some of these errors has been devise...|$|E

Development of reliable health monitoring techniques for EMAs promises to maintain or even increase the overall availability {{and safety of}} these new aircraft designs. When it comes to EMAs and similar mechanisms, certain fault types clearly manifest themselves through loss of functionality. Other faults, referred to as latent, do not immediately result in a significantly compromised actuator performance, thus making them challenging to detect. This paper presents a new vibration-based hybrid technique for detecting latent EMA faults without needing an initial stage of fault feature learning. The two faults considered in the study are a high-criticality jam and a low-criticality spall (metal flaking) in the actuator <b>ballscrew</b> mechanism. The actuator position is used to resample variable-speed vibration measurements of a single accelerometer into constant-rate measurements.

The vibration signatures approach is also compared to the diagnostic approach based on EMA motor current measurements.

The present study is concerned with the development of a condition monitoring system for high speed Computer Numerical Control (CNC) milling machine tools.

SIMULINK models have been developed to represent the majority of the dynamic behaviour of the feed drives from the actual CNC machine tool. Various values for the position controller and the load torque have been applied to the motor to show their behaviour. Development of a mechatronic hybrid model for five-axis CNC machine tool using Multi-Body-System (MBS) simulation approach is described. Analysis of CNC machine tool performance under non-cutting conditions is developed. ServoTrace data have been used to validate the Multi-body simulation of tool-to-workpiece position.

40|$|The {{precision}} {{control of}} linear feed axes in machine tools is {{examined in this}} thesis. Al¬though high precision in machining has been {{a focal point for}} engineers for over 200 years, the traditional solutions have often been based on complex mechanical designs. In this thesis, two aspects of feed axis controller design are examined: i) the use of appropriate mathematical models and ii) the signiﬁcance of three of the most common performance limiting factors that have traditionally affected precision in linear feed axes. The three particular performance limiting factors considered are: i) dynamic stiffness, ii) torsional vibrations and iii) backlash. The most effective way of obtaining knowledge about a control system is through appro¬priate mathematical modelling. A new two-body model for a simple motor-transmission¬load system is presented in this thesis. This new model is shown to provide a more accurate representation of both the total inertia and lowest natural frequency of a system, when compared with the two-body model that is traditionally used by researchers and system designers. A new model to represent backlash in a two-body system is also pre¬sented. These new models are then extended to provide accurate mathematical models of four common linear feed axis drive conﬁgurations: i) a rotary motor driving a rack and pinion transmission, ii) a rotary motor directly driving a <b>ballscrew</b> transmission, iii) a rotary motor driving a <b>ballscrew</b> transmission via a synchronous belt, and iv) a linear motor directly driving the axis. Different control solutions to the problems of dynamic stiffness, torsional vibrations and backlash are examined in this thesis, with each controller implemented on specially con¬structed test-beds. An approach using Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) is presented xxi for systems with inherently low dynamic stiffness. This QFT approach is shown to pro¬vide a transparent design process, which results in high dynamic stiffness. Different controllers for torsional vibrations are compared both theoretically and experimentally, with many previously published solutions shown to be theoretically equivalent. A new backlash controller is also presented, which is shown experimentally to provide dynamic stability and good tracking performance at both high and low velocities. The importance of treating these performance limiting factors simultaneously is also ad¬dressed in this thesis, with the control solutions developed to address some factors shown to also affect the other factors. The QFT approach is shown to provide a suitable inte¬grated design process, where the implications of any compromises, on the control of each factor, are clearly visible...|$|E
