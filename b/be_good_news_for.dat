50|$|As {{time went}} on, figs were spread from their {{indigenous}} region of Western Asia, and their comfortable {{home in the}} Mediterranean, throughout many other {{places around the world}} (of course, despite their increasing ability to grow in many different regions, the Mediterranean still remains the ideal location for the raising of figs. They migrated into Afghanistan and expanded to southern Germany and the Canary Islands. They made their way to England and then China, and eventually to Japan, South Africa, India, Australia, the United States (California to be more specific.), and of course many other places around the globe. Figs soon found themselves woven into the economy of many different countries. The production, import, and export of figs is vital in some regions.  For example, in 2010, Turkey was the number one exporter and producer of figs in the world, producing around 24% of the world’s supply and exporting around 254, 838 metric tons. Egypt was the second largest producer, producing around 184,972 metric tons. Austria trailed Turkey as the second largest exporter, exporting somewhere near 6,131 metric tons. In 2009, France, Austria, and Germany were the top 3 importers of figs, with Canada trailing as number 4. The demand for figs has remained steady for many years and it looks as though it will stay that way for a while, or perhaps even increase, which would of course <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>for</b> the countries that lead in the fig trade.|$|E
