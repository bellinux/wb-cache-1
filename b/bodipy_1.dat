The X-ray structure {{analysis revealed that}} the benzimidazole NH group is involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding with fluoride atoms {{which resulted in a}} coplanar geometry between BODIPY and benzimidazole moiety. The presence of benzimidazole moiety at 3 -position of BODIPY siginificantly altered the electronic properties, which is clearly evident in bathochromic shifts of absorption and fluorescence bands, improved quantum yields, increased lifetimes compared to BODIPY 2. The anion binding studies indicated that <b>BODIPY</b> <b>1</b> showed remarkable selectivity and specificity toward F- ion over other anions. Addition of F- ion to <b>BODIPY</b> <b>1</b> resulted in quenching of fluorescence accompanied by a visual detectable color change from fluorescent pink to nonfluorescent blue [...] The recognition mechanism is attributed to a fluoride-triggered disruption of the hydrogen bonding between BODIPY and benzimidazole moieties leading to (i) noncoplanar geometry between BODIPY and benzimidazole units and (ii) operation of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from benzimidazole moiety to BODIPY unit causing quenching of fluorescence. Interestingly, when we titrated the nonfluorescent blue 1 -F- solution with TFA resulted in a significant enhancement of fluorescence intensity (15 -fold) because the PET quenching is prevented due to protonation of benzimidazole group. Furthermore, the reversibility and reusability of sensor 1 for the detection of F- ion was tested for six cycles indicating the sensor 1 is stable and can be used in reversible manner...|$|E

40|$|In our {{laboratory}} for organic synthesis in Leuven, {{a lot of}} synthetic methods have been developed concerning organic polycyclic donor systems such as pentacene, carbazoles and more recently indolo[3, 2 -b]carbazoles (ICZs). This project {{is related to the}} ICZs and will focus on developing new synthetic methodologies to prepare novel building blocks, which will be coupled with known acceptor moieties like diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), BODIPY and maleimides, to synthesize donor-acceptor materials which can be tested for organic electronics. The aim of this project is to provide a synthetic contribution to this research area. In first instance, the already available 2, 8 -functionalized ICZs will be converted to acceptor-donor-acceptor (A-D-A) molecules by coupling with complementary functionalized acceptor units. For this purpose, palladium catalyzed reactions such as Suzuki-, Stille- or Sonogashira coupling reactions will be used. Previous research showed that optimalization of the reaction conditions is of importance to obtain high yields for these reactions. The properties of these A-D-A molecules will be investigated by UV-VIS spectroscopy. The aim is to obtain a broad and intense absorbance over the visible wavelength range.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>Bodipy</b> GM <b>1</b> in monolayers of binary and ternary lipid mixtures with coexisting fluid and ordered phases has been examined {{using a combination}} of atomic force microscopy and near-field scanning optical microscopy. Monolayers deposited at high (30 mN/m) and low (5 or 10 mN/m) surface pressures were examined and compared to those containing the same concentration of unlabeled ganglioside. Measurements of monomer and dimer Bodipy emission were used to distinguish aggregated from dilute ganglioside levels. For binary DPPC/DOPC monolayers, <b>Bodipy</b> GM <b>1</b> is distributed throughout both the fluid and ordered phases at low surface pressures, and both labeled and unlabeled gangliosides result in a reduction in the size of ordered DPPC domains at 0. 4 % and the appearance of small aligned ganglioside-rich domains at 4 %. In agreement with earlier studies, GM 1 is heterogeneously distributed in small islands in the condensed DPPC domains at high surface pressure. By contrast, <b>Bodipy</b> GM <b>1</b> causes the disappearance of large DPPC domains at 0. 4 % and the formation of a new GM 1 -rich phase at 4 %.

In particular, dyes functionalized with oligo(ethylene glycol) ether styryl or naphthalene vinylene {{groups at the}} α positions of the BODIPY core (3 - 6) become partially soluble in water, and their absorptions and emissions {{are located in the}} far-red or near-infrared region. Three synthetic approaches are attempted to access the meso-carboxylic acid (COOH) -substituted BODIPYs 7 and 8 from the meso-ester-substituted BODIPYs. Two feasible synthetic routes are developed successfully, including one short route with only three steps. The meso-COOH-substituted BODIPY 7 is completely soluble in pure water, and its fluorescence maximum reaches around 650 nm with a fluorescence quantum yield of up to 15 %. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations are conducted to understand the structure-optical properties relationship, and it is revealed that the Stokes shift is dependent mainly on the geometric change from the ground state to the first excited singlet state. Furthermore, cell staining tests demonstrate that the meso-ester-substituted <b>BODIPYs</b> (<b>1</b> and 3 - 6) and one of the meso-COOH-substituted BODIPYs (8) are very membrane-permeable.

Each type of domain exchanged constituents but assumed fixed positions, suggesting self-clustering and anchorage to spectrin. Domains showed differential association with 4. 1 R versus ankyrin complexes upon antibody patching. BODIPY-lipid domains also responded differentially to uncoupling at 4. 1 R complexes [protein kinase C (PKC) activation] and ankyrin complexes (in spherocytosis, a membrane fragility disease).

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been part of these methods for many years therefore; too much financial effort has been spent on this field. Since PDT relays on three important components namely: Sensitizer, molecular oxygen and light, our group has worked and published several photosensitizers derived from BODIPY over the years. In this thesis two different ideas to be used in PDT are introduced. First, Heavy atom free orthogonal BODIPY trimmers are introduced {{for the first time in}} literature and they are believed to work according to DS-TR principle.

The last decade has witnessed {{particular interest in}} the development of two-photon excitable probes, due to their advantageous features in tissue imaging compared to the corresponding one-photon probes [1]. Recently, we have designed and synthetized an aminonaphthalimide–BODIPY derivative as energy transfer cassettes and were found to show very fast and efficient BODIPY fluorescence sensitization [2]. This was observed upon one- and two-photon excitation, which extends the application range of the investigated bichromophoric dyads in terms of accessible excitation wavelengths. In order to increase the two-photon absorption of the system aminonaphthalimide fluorophore was replace with a Prodan analog (<b>BODIPY</b> dyad <b>1),</b> which presents found a variety of applications as probes and labels in biology [3]. The two-photon absorption cross-section  of the dyads is significantly incremented by the presence of the 6 -acetyl- 2 -naphthylamine donor group. The emission maximum of a BODIPY fluorophore can significantly be red-shifted in comparison to their precursors by conjugation with aromatic aldehydes.

40|$|Boron dipyrromethenes are {{strongly}} colored solids that form intensely colored solutions with bright fluorescence upon irradiation and are better known by {{their trade name}} BODIPY. Over {{the last two decades}} these dyes have become an important class of fluorophores on account of their many excellent characteristics, as is evident from the numerous applications being reported for these dyes. Particularly their rich functionalization chemistry is a major reason for their attractiveness, as it allows a practically unlimited structural modification and hence provides a method to fine tune their chemical and physical properties. However, the traditional derivatization strategies are rather inefficient and/or require the manipulation of unstable intermediates. More efficient strategies to functionalize BODIPY dyes are based on C–H functionalization, allowing the introduction of the desired group in one reaction step. In this work, several C–H functionalization reactions were discovered and developed. Two different approaches to achieve functionalization of the C–H bond were explored. The first is based on transition metal catalyzed reactions involving C–H activation, the second strategy is based on radical reactions. The first developed reaction is a palladium catalyzed C–H arylation between a boron dipyrrin and a bromoarene at high temperatures. This arylation reaction affords 3 -monoaryl and 3, 5 -diaryl dyes in moderate yields. A cross-dehydrogenative C–H arylation procedure between benzothiophene and BODIPY was also investigated, but could provide the desired product only in a low yield. A milder arylation protocol at room temperature was developed using a ferrocene catalyzed reduction of aryldiazonium salts {{in the presence of a}} boron dipyrromethene dye. This radical C–H arylation is a fast and high yielding reaction displaying a broad scope. By using this procedure both 3 -monoaryl and 3, 5 -diaryl dyes can be synthesized. A second radical transformation that was developed uses oxidation of organoboranes, such as potassium trifluoroborate salts and boronic acids, in the presence of a BODIPY dye and provides a broad range of 3 -monoalkylated fluorophores. By pushing the reaction at a higher temperature di-, tri- and tetraalkylated dyes can also be prepared. These novel protocols proved to be powerful synthetic tools for the preparation of a broad range of BODIPY derivatives. The utility of these reactions was demonstrated by synthesizing several sophisticated molecules, including asymmetrically substituted fluorophores, annulated chromophores and solid-emissive dyes.

Structural integrity of the dyad was arrived from two-dimensional NMR spectral studies, while single-crystal X-ray structure of the dyad provided the relative orientation of the two macrocycles {{to be similar to}} 62 degrees. Because of direct linking of the two entities, ultrafast energy transfer from the (<b>BODIPY)</b> -B- <b>1</b> * to azaBODIPY was witnessed. A good agreement between the theoretically estimated Forster energy transfer rate and experimentally determined rate was observed, and this rate was found to be higher than that reported for BODIPY-azaBODIPY analogues connected with spacer units. In agreement with the free-energy calculations, the product of energy transfer, (1) azaBODIPY* revealed additional photochemical events such as electron transfer leading to the creation of BODIPY center dot+-azaBODIPY(center dot-) radical ion pair, more so in polar benzonitrile than in nonpolar toluene, as evidenced by femtosecond transient spectroscopic studies. Additionally, the spectral, electrochemical, and photochemical studies of the precursor compound azaBODIPY-dipyrromethane also revealed occurrence of excited-state events.

Using this approach, prominent red fluorescent labeling of the Golgi apparatus, Golgi apparatus-associated tubulovesicular processes, and putative Golgi apparatus transport vesicles was seen in living human skin fibroblasts, as well as in other cell types. Based on fluorescence ratio imaging microscopy, we estimate that C 5 -DMB-Cer and its metabolites were present in Golgi apparatus membranes at concentrations up to 5 - 10 mol %.

This lipid exhibits a shift in its fluorescence emission maximum from green (approximately 515 nm) to red (approximately 620 nm) wavelengths with increasing concentrations in membranes. When cells were incubated with 5 microM C 5 -DMB-SM at 4 degrees C and washed, only plasma membrane fluorescence (yellow-green) was observed. When these cells were briefly (< or = 1 min) warmed to 37 degrees C to allow internalization to occur, and then incubated with defatted bovine serum albumin (back-exchanged) at 11 degrees C to remove fluorescent lipids from the plasma membrane, C 5 -DMB-SM was distributed in a punctate pattern throughout the cytoplasm. Interestingly, within the same cell some endosomes exhibited green fluorescence, whereas others emitted red-orange fluorescence. Furthermore, the red-orange endosomes were usually seen at the periphery of the cell, while the green endosomes were more uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. This mixed population of endosomes was seen after internalization times as short as 7 s and was also seen over a wide range of C 5 -DMB-SM concentrations (1 - 25 microM). Control experiments established that the variously colored endosomes were not induced by changes in pH, membrane potential, vesicle size, or temperature. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the apparent concentration of the lipid analog in the red-orange endosomes was severalfold higher than its initial concentration at the plasma membrane, suggesting selective internalization (sorting) of the lipid into a subset of early endosomes. Colocalization studies using C 5 -DMB-SM and either anti-transferrin receptor antibodies or fluorescently labeled low-density lipoprotein further demonstrated that this subpopulation of endosomes resulted from receptor-mediated endocytosis. We conclude that the spectral properties of C 5 -DMB-SM can be used to distinguish unique populations of early endosomes from one another and to record dynamic changes in their number and distribution within living cells...|$|R

However, the entire signaling pathways downstream of DIF- 1 remain to be elucidated. To characterize DIF- 1 and its potential receptor(s), we synthesized two fluorescent derivatives of DIF- <b>1,</b> boron-dipyrromethene (<b>BODIPY)</b> -conjugated DIF- <b>1</b> (DIF- 1 -BODIPY) and nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) -conjugated DIF- 1 (DIF- 1 -NBD), and investigated their biological activities and cellular localization. DIF- 1 -BODIPY (5  µM) and DIF- 1 (2  nM) induced stalk cell differentiation in the DIF-deficient strain HM 44 in the presence of cyclic adenosine monosphosphate (cAMP), whereas DIF- 1 -NBD (5  µM) hardly induced stalk cell differentiation under the same conditions. Microscopic analyses revealed that the biologically active derivative, DIF- 1 -BODIPY, was incorporated by stalk cells at late stages of differentiation and was localized to mitochondria. The mitochondrial uncouplers carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), at 25 – 50  nM, and dinitrophenol (DNP), at 2. 5 – 5  µM, induced partial stalk cell differentiation in HM 44 in the presence of cAMP. DIF- 1 -BODIPY (1 – 2  µM) and DIF- 1 (10  nM), as well as CCCP and DNP, suppressed chemotaxis in the wild-type strain Ax 2 in shallow cAMP gradients. These results suggest that DIF- 1 -BODIPY and DIF- 1 induce stalk cell differentiation and modulate chemotaxis, at least in part, by disturbing mitochondrial activity...|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}} Taking {{the high}} road: Highly efficient electronic energy transfer takes place from {{a set of}} appended aryl polycyclic hydrocarbons to an expanded boron dipyrromethene (Bodipy) -based dye (see figure) despite negligible spectral overlap with the lowest-energy excited state localised on the acceptor. A multi-component array has been constructed around an expanded boron dipyrromethene (Bodipy) dye that absorbs and emits in the far-red region. One of the appendages is a perylene-based moiety that {{is connected to the}} boron atom of the terminal <b>Bodipy</b> by a <b>1,</b> 4 -diethynylphenylene connector. Despite {{the fact that there is}} almost negligible spectral overlap between fluorescence from the perylene unit and absorption by the Bodipy residue, electronic energy transfer is rapid and essentially quantitative. It is concluded that at least half of the photons absorbed by perylene are transferred to the upper-lying singlet excited state (S 2) associated with the Bodipy-based acceptor. The second appendage is a pyrene unit that is covalently linked to fluorene, through an ethynylene spacer, and to the boron atom of the Bodipy terminus, through a 1, 4 -diethynylphenylene connector. Pyrene absorbs and emits at higher energy than perylene and there is strong spectral overlap with the Bodipy-based S 2 state, and none with the corresponding S 1 state. Electronic energy transfer is now very fast and exclusively to the S 2 state of the acceptor. It is difficult to compute reasonable estimates for the rates of Coulombic energy transfer, because of uncertainties in the orientation factor, but the principle mechanism is believed to arise from electron exchange. Comparison with an earlier array built around a conventional Bodipy dye indicates that there are comparable electronic coupling matrix elements for the two systems. It is notable that pyrene is more strongly coupled to the Bodipy unit than perylene in both arrays. These new arrays function as highly effective solar concentrators. </p...|$|R

Normal A 7 r 5 cells (cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells), Cav- 1 overexpressing cells, and cells treated with 10 mM cyclodextrin for 30 minutes were immunolabeled with Cav- 1 and CD 36. The peripheral to central ratio of CD 36 in Cav- 1 overexpressing cells (1. 52 ± 0. 19) was significantly higher than in control cells (1. 05 ± 0. 16, p= 0. 035) and cyclodextrin-treated cells (0. 861 ± 0. 279, p= 0. 035). Fatty acid uptake at 5, 10, and 15 seconds was quantified with fluorescence of C <b>1</b> <b>BODIPY</b> 500 / 510 C 12, a long-chain fatty acid analog. A 7 r 5 VSM cells overexpressing Cav- 1 had decrease a in the rate of fatty acid uptake compared to control cells. Cells treated with cyclodextrin also had a decrease in fatty acid uptake compared to control. Cav- 1 overexpressing cells incubated in 0. 05 mM palmitate had 31. 4 ± 8. 8 % apoptosis, where only 3. 9 ± 1. 0 % of Cav- 1 overexpressing cells incubated in palmitate were apoptotic (p= 0. 044).

40|$|Ultrafast {{electronic}} spectroscopy {{was conducted}} on simple molecular systems in order to elucidate mechanisms involved in intra-electronic energy transfer {{as well as the}} role of solvent in reaction dynamics. ^ Intra-electronic energy transfer has been investigated for a series of 9 -bromo- 10 -phenylethynyl-anthracene- 4, 4 -difluoro- 4 -bora- 3 a, 4 a-diaza-s-indacene (ANBO) molecular cassettes. The ANBO series is a group of molecules with varying fluorescence spectrum dependent on the BODIPY derivative. A case study of ANBO 2 was conducted since it is representative of the structures in the ANBO series. The relaxation time of the donor La bromo-anthracene-ethynylphenyl state of ANBO 2 has been measured by both fluorescence upconversion and fluorescence detected two-photon absorption to be 630 fs. The acceptor (BODIPY) fluorescence time response of ANBO 2 shows a biexponential rise (∼ 50 fs, 800 fs), which demonstrates that two or more processes are occurring. The measured intra-electronic energy transfer rates for the ANBO series are not sensitive to the spectral overlap of the fluorescence of the donor and absorption of the acceptor portions of the molecules. The intra-electronic coupling mechanism for the ANBO series is proposed to be a non-uniform coupling of the higher manifold of vibrational levels of the S <b>1</b> <b>BODIPY</b> state with the La state of bromo-anthracene-ethynylphenyl. The observed response of ANBO 2 was compared with quantitative predictions of Förster theory including a monopole representation of the transition charge interaction. No agreement was found. The through bond coupling and super exchange were also considered. ^ The photodissociation of HgBr 2 in solution was examined using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Wavepacket dynamics were observed for the HgBr radical after HgBr 2 photolysis. Whereas the photolysis of HgBr 2 in acetonitrile and ethanol show conventional damped wavepacket dynamics of HgBr, in dimethyl sulfoxide a chirped wavepacket with a nonexponential decay is observed. The chirped wavepacket in transient absorption response on the photolysis of HgBr 2, which is attributed to the modification of the HgBr potential as a result of solvation occurring on the time scale of the wavepacket motion, provides microscopic insight into the structural and dynamical properties of the solvation process. ...|$|R

However, the mechanism of Tiaozhi Tongmai Granules is still unclear. In this study, we have combined experiments with network pharmacology to explore the anti-atherosclerosis mechanism of Tiaozhi Tongmai Granules. Method: 120 male ApoE−/− mice were randomly divided into three groups: the model group, Chinese herb group and Atorvastatin group. The model group, Atorvastatin group and Chinese herb group were fed with a high-fat diet, a high-fat diet plus atorvastatin (5. 1  mg/kg/d) and a high-fat diet plus Tiaozhi Tongmai Granules (16. 5  g/kg/d) for 16 weeks, respectively. Atherogenesis was identified by H&E staining. The colocalization of neutral lipid stain BODIPY and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC 3) and the colocalization of BODIPY and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP 1) within ApoE−/− mice aortic plaques were tested using fluorescence confocal microscopy and the Pearson's coefficients were calculated. To further explore the anti-atherosclerosis mechanism of Tiaozhi Tongmai Granules, the network pharmacology was used to construct the herb-compound-target network. Results: The size of the aortic lipid plaque in the Chinese herb group and Atorvastatin group were smaller compared with the model group on the 16 th week. Compared with the model group on the 16 th week, the BODIPY and LC 3 colocalization rate, the <b>BODIPY</b> and LAMP <b>1</b> colocalization rate of the Chinese herb group and Atorvastatin group all presented significant increase in the aortic plaque (P < . 001), showing that Tiaozhi Tongmai Granules could enhance autophagosome activity in the macrophage. In the herb-compound-target network, 17 active compounds and 27 targets were obtained through literature searching and using LHRI & DAVID Bioinformatics. It was found that 23 targets were correlated with the macrophage. Some of them participated in macrophage inflammatory response, and the other targets could promote/inhibit phagocytosis of the macrophage. It was hypothesized that the active compounds of Tiaozhi Tongmai Granules were acting on these targets and having y the biological effects. Conclusions: In the progression stage of atherosclerosis, Tiaozhi Tongmai Granules can still make the macrophage have higher autophagosome activity, and play a role of anti-atherogenesis...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use of {{advanced}} fluorescence imaging and spectroscopic methods for investigating various properties of biological membranes. The cell membrane is a complex environment comprised {{of a variety of}} important molecules all necessary for maintaining cellular function. The dynamics of processes involved in membranes are typically over very short time and spatial frames. Advanced fluorescence imaging and spectroscopic methods present an opportunity for probing the dynamic nature of this environment due to their high levels of both spatial and temporal resolution. The following thesis consists of three biological problems centred on the cellular membrane, investigated through high resolution techniques. The first area of investigation focusses on the insulin regulated metabolism of glucose in fat and muscle tissue. Traditional experiments are performed using either isolated rat adipocytes or differentiated fibroblasts which both required lengthy and expensive culturing procedures. A new modified HeLa cell line was investigated to determine its efficacy as a homologue to the well characterised adipocyte model as a method for investigating factors affecting glucose metabolism. A direct comparison of the dynamic recruitment of the molecule Glucose Transporter 4 (GLUT 4) to the plasma membrane was undertaken using a custom built Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM) system. Utilising TIRFM the time dependant translocation of GLUT 4 to the plasma membrane under insulin stimulation was investigated in the two cell lines. This was achieved through analysis of the increase in normalised fluorescence signal found within the 110 nm illuminated region of the TIRFM system. It was found that in the HeLa cell line responsiveness to insulin stimulation was present but with a significant difference in GLUT 4 levels to the imaged adipocytes. It was also seen that this observed response occurred over a significantly longer time frame than in adipocyte cells with a half rise time in fluorescence intensity taking, on average, 5 minutes longer. In addition, the dynamic mobility of GLUT 4 Storage Vesicles (GSVs) within the vicinity of the membrane was assessed through image analysis techniques. The abundance of mobile and stationary vesicles was assessed. In the adipocyte cells a sharp increase in mobile GSVs was observed over the initial 5 minutes after insulin stimulation. The amount of immobilised GSVs was seen to increase at a constant rate over the time course of experimentation. In the HeLa cell line, a similar rate of mobile GSV activity was observed, however, a decline in stationary GSVs was found. The increased accumulation of mobile vesicles at the plasma membrane is in accordance with previously proposed models of GSV recruitment. However, the reduction in stationary vesicles at the membrane surface in the HeLa cell line suggested differences in the machinery associated with vesicle fusion. The second area of study focussed on the analysis of the environmentally sensitive class of fluorophores known as molecular rotors, in particular the meso-substituted BODIPY rotor. Molecular rotors are said to report on the viscosity of the environment in which they reside but questions still remained over their efficacy of assessing viscosity in complex environments such as lipid bilayers. A combined Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence lifetime system was optimised to simultaneously probe the lateral mobility and viscosity sensitive fluorescent lifetime of the dye in artificial bilayer systems. The diffusion coefficients measured directly through FCS were compared with those inferred from the lifetime values by conversion through the Saffman-Delbruck model. Those measured by FCS were found to be similar to previously simulated values suggesting a well working experimental system. The values found through lifetime analysis were of the same order to those measured by FCS but differed by as much as a factor of 2 in some cases. The reasons for this most likely lie through the inherent assumptions made using the Saffman-Delbruck model. In addition, the probes were assessed in bilayers of differing degrees of phospholipid saturation. It was observed that the viscosity of the environment increased with decreasing saturation in the hydrocarbon tail regions of the lipids. This was noted through the diffusion coefficients measured with both methods. The final chapter focussed on the creation of a system to increase the resolution of Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) by implementing a TIRFM illumination scheme. The focus of this work was to increase resolution for imaging of membrane viscosity through {{the use of}} molecular rotors. Molecular rotors in cellular systems are susceptible to endocytosis over certain time frames, limiting their use in physiologically relevant studies in vitro. A gated FLIM system was constructed through the combination of pulsed laser diodes and a gated Intensified Charge Coupled Device (ICCD) camera. To investigate the abilities of the system to selectively image a surface localised signal relating to membrane viscosity, Supported Lipid Bilayers (SLBs) were used. It was found, through both lifetime and FCS, that the substrate on which the bilayer was deposited reduced the mobility of the probe and the measured fluorescence lifetime. The effect was a change in diffusion coefficient by a factor or 2 - 3 which was taken into account when assessing the viscosity measured through FLIM of SLBs. The TIRF-FLIM principle was then demonstrated through imaging of SLBs containing the molecular rotor BODIPY against a highly fluorescent background of the fluorophore FITC. FITC provided a background with a distinctly longer lifetime to that of the rotor in the bilayer. The system was able to resolve the surface localised lifetime signal over a range of concentrations of background signal from nano-molar to micro-molar. The critical point, where the bilayer lifetime became indistinguishable from the background, came at a fluorophore ratio of 2 : <b>1</b> <b>BODIPY</b> to FITC...|$|R
