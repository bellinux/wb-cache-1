60|$|George hid her. He did it, too, without wasting {{precious}} time by asking questions. In a situation which {{might well have}} thrown the quickest-witted of men off his balance, he acted with promptitude, intelligence and despatch. The fact is, George had for years been an assiduous golfer; {{and there is no}} finer school for teaching concentration and a strict attention to the matter in hand. Few crises, however unexpected, have the power to disturb a man who has so conquered the weakness of the flesh as to have trained himself to bend his left knee, raise his left heel, swing his arms well out from the <b>body,</b> <b>twist</b> himself into the shape of a corkscrew and use the muscle of the wrist, at the same time keeping his head still and his eye on the ball. It is estimated that there are twenty-three important points to be borne in mind simultaneously while making a drive at golf; and to the man who has mastered the art of remembering them all the task of hiding girls in taxicabs is mere child's play. To pull down the blinds {{on the side of the}} vehicle nearest the kerb was with George the work of a moment. Then he leaned out of the centre window in such a manner as completely to screen the interior of the cab from public view.|$|E

The Coupé has a sleek fastback rear window that slopes down to an integrated spoiler shaped to deliver downforce to the rear axle at speed.|$|E
40|$|The hermit's <b>body</b> <b>twist</b> “Rusie Dotton ” are {{physical}} exercise postures which are evidently restored in the Region of King Rama I (1782 - 1809). He {{was the first}} King of Chakri Dynasty who established Bangkok as the capital of Thailand. The restoration was aimed to integrate all knowledge of Thai medicine which Rusie dotton is obviously included. The king would like his people to use the Rusie Dotton for relaxation and therapy [1]. The king had ordered to build and keep all Rusie Dotton sculptures at Wat Phrachetuphon Vimolmangklaram Rajwaramahaviharn (Wat Pho or The temple of the redining buddha) so that his people can access, follow, and relax with Hermit's <b>body</b> <b>twist</b> easily. The temple is located adjacent to the Grand Palace in Bangkok. Later on, during the Region of King Rama III (1787 - 1851). He graciously ordered Krommuen Naronghariruks to lead in sculpting all 80 Rusie Dotton postures into new sculptures. These new sculptures were formed by zinc and tin (Chin) making them more durable. Finished sculptures are distributed to the monasteries surrounding the temple. Each of the sculptures has companied by an engraved stone. Each of the stones has been distinctly engraved by poems composed by the King Rama, and his royal families, royal court officials, poets, monks, and common people...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} explores how {{directives}} are constituted {{in and through}} situated verbal, bodily, and spatial practices. The foci are parental directives requesting routine family tasks {{to be carried out}} in an immediate situational context and necessitating the childs locomotion {{from one place to another}} (e. g., to take a bath, brush his/her teeth). As documented, such directive sequences were designed with what is here called parental shepherding moves, that is, "techniques of the body" (Mauss 1973 [1935]) that monitor the childs body for compliance. <b>Body</b> <b>twist,</b> a form of tactile intervention, was deployed to terminate the childs prior activity and initiate a relevant activity by perceptually reorienting the child in the lived architecture of the home. Tactile and non-tactile steering constituted means for monitoring and controlling the direction, pace, and route of the childs locomotion. Overall, these embodied directives served as multifunctional cultural tools that scaffolded the child into reflexive awareness of the dialogic and embodied characteristics of social action and accountability...|$|E

40|$|Children's {{physical}} fitness are suggested {{to show signs}} of improvement gradually over time. However, their level of {{physical fitness}} continue to remain low, with no change evident from a long-term perspective. The throwing ability in childen is remarkably low with factors of physical fitness. Thus far, instruction has focused on teaching children how to throw a ball (throwing form) to master throwing motion. However, to help them practice moving their <b>body</b> and <b>twisting</b> their core, it may be more effective to teach them correct foot motion. I created the Step -kun to serve as an instructional tool to indicate proper foot movements. Using the Step -kun, children were able to perform foot movements linked to shifting the weight of their body (p< 0. 001) and <b>body</b> <b>twisting</b> motions (p< 0. 05). Records taken after the lesson showed statistically significant improvement (p< 0. 01), and those children who practiced the <b>body</b> <b>twisting</b> motion showed particularly significant improvement (p< 0. 01). These findings suggest that the Step -kun may be useful in helping children learn proper throwing motion and improve their throwing ability. 子どもの体力が少しずつ向上の兆しがあると言われているが、長期的な視点で見れば依然として低い状態である。とりわけ投能力の低下が著しい。これまで投能力向上のために投げ方（フォーム）を身に付けさせることを中心に指導が行われてきた。本研究では、投動作の習得と投能力向上のために自作教具「ステップくん」を作製し、特に投動作の習得過程で活用することの有効性を明らかにすることを目的とした。その結果、「ステップくん」を活用したことで、体重移動に結び付く足上げ動作（p< 0. 001 ）や体のひねり動作（p< 0. 05 ）が習得された。また、授業後の記録も有意に向上（p< 0. 01 ）し、特に体のひねり動作を習得した群ほど記録は向上していた（p< 0. 05 ）。「ステップくん」の特異的効果と限定はできないものの、「ステップくん」を活用することで投動作は身に付き、投能力を向上させることが可能であることが示唆された...|$|R

40|$|We aim at {{investigating}} the morphology, kinematic and helicity {{evolution of a}} loop-like prominence during its eruption. We use multi-instrument observations from AIA/SDO, EUVI/STEREO and LASCO/SoHO. The kinematic, morphological, geometrical, and helicity evolution of a loop-like eruptive prominence are studied {{in the context of}} the magnetic flux rope model of solar prominences. The prominence eruption evolved as a height expanding twisted loop with both legs anchored in the chromosphere of a plage area. The eruption process consists of a prominence activation, acceleration, and a phase of constant velocity. The prominence body was composed of left-hand (counter-clockwise) twisted threads around the main prominence axis. The twist during the eruption was estimated at 6 pi (3 turns). The prominence reached a maximum height of 526 Mm before contracting to its primary location and partially reformed in the same place two days after the eruption. This ejection, however, triggered a CME seen in LASCO C 2. The prominence was located in the northern periphery of the CME magnetic field configuration and, therefore, the background magnetic field was asymmetric with respect to the filament position. The physical conditions of the falling plasma blobs were analysed with respect to the prominence kinematics. The same sign of the prominence <b>body</b> <b>twist</b> and writhe, as well as the amount of twisting above the critical value of 2 pi after the activation phase indicate that possibly conditions for kink instability were present. No signature of magnetic reconnection was observed anywhere in the prominence body and its surroundings. The filament/prominence descent following the eruption and its partial reformation at the same place two days later suggest a confined type of eruption. The asymmetric background magnetic field possibly played an important role in the failed eruption. Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures, in press in A&...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a general method for the {{formulation}} of the dynamical equations of general $N$-axis, serial-type robotic manipulators of otherwise arbitrary architecture, with rigid and flexible links, is presented. The dynamic simulation {{of this type of}} manipulator is also included. The two different methods of formulation discussed here are the hybrid Newton-Euler (NE) /Euler-Lagrange (EL) formulation for the study of flexible-link manipulators and the NE formulation, for the study of rigid-link manipulators. The hybrid NE/EL formulation lends itself to a systematic and conceptually straightforward formulation for flexible-link manipulators, as opposed to the NE formulation which, in this case, will be much more difficult. The novelty in both of the approaches is the introduction of the natural orthogonal complement to eliminate the constraint wrenches, which are readily computed from the generalized twist of the overall manipulator. Another salient feature of the natural orthogonal complement method is that it can be readily applied to manipulators with kinematic loops. The formulation of the dynamical equations of flexible-link manipulators is carried out by considering each link as an unconstrained body and writing its EL equations disregarding kinematic couplings. These equations are expressed in terms of the <b>body</b> <b>twist</b> and its time derivative. The individual-link equations, along with the associated constraint wrenches, are assembled to obtain the constrained dynamical equations of the manipulator. The nonworking constraint wrenches are then efficiently eliminated by simple matrix multiplication of the said equations by the transpose of the natural orthogonal complement to obtain the independent dynamical equations. These equations are then solved for accelerations using the Cholesky decomposition. The integration of the accelerations is performed using Gear's stiff method of backward differentiation. To ascertain the effects of link flexibility on the overall performance of the manipulator, the dynamic simulation of the flexible-link manipulator is compared with the dynamic simulation of the same manipulator considering all links to be rigid. Numerical examples, chosen from specialized literature are included to demonstrate the validity of the dynamical equations and the algorithms to solve them. The dynamic simulation, ranging from a single-link- to a six-link-manipulator, with all links flexible, is presented. The results of simulations for all these manipulators indicate that the effects of structural flexibility on the motion of the manipulator can be considerable even at low speeds. The simulation results also bring to light the effects of various joint torques on the elastic behaviour of the manipulator. Finally, {{it was found that the}} stability of the numerical integration schemes used depended largely on the type of input joint torques...|$|E
