5000|$|There {{are several}} {{options for the}} {{mounting}} of a pony bottle.

This is a much safer procedure than the buddies having to have to be connected through use of hosed regulators. The addition of a pony bottle to the divers equipment will add an off-balanced weight to the side on which it is mounted. To compensate for this an equal <b>balancing</b> <b>weight</b> is often added to the tank band on the opposite side of the pony, or in an off-side weight pocket.

But starting with <b>balanced</b> <b>weight</b> functions {{gives rise to a}} different and somewhat liberating attitude. Because these functions are additive, complexmodels can be built rather easily, and such functions arise naturally from weighted circuits. The idea of a <b>balanced</b> <b>weight</b> function extends to a multi-particle system called an induced field, in which each particle is influenced by the other particles as a function of their locations, and yet the invariant distribution of the system is still immediately available. This simplicity encourages the formulation of relatively complex models with the expectation that their invariant behavior will be available for interpretation and application. Three different and somewhat novel processes are created this way and for each the invariant distribution is given explicitly. These results may be of some independent interest as well as illustrating the method...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{unsupervised}} salient object segmentation approach based on kernel density estimation (KDE) and two-phase graph cut. A set of KDE models are first constructed {{based on the}} pre-segmentation result of the input image, and then for each pixel, a set of likelihoods to fit all KDE models are calculated accordingly. The color saliency and spatial saliency of each KDE model are then evaluated based on its color distinctiveness and spatial distribution, and the pixel-wise saliency map is generated by integrating likelihood measures of pixels and saliency measures of KDE models. In {{the first phase of}} salient object segmentation, the saliency map based graph cut is exploited to obtain an initial segmentation result. In the second phase, the segmentation is further refined based on an iterative seed adjustment method, which efficiently utilizes the information of minimum cut generated using the KDE model based graph cut, and exploits a <b>balancing</b> <b>weight</b> update scheme for convergence of segmentation refinement. Experimental results on a dataset containing 1000 test images with ground truths demonstrate the better segmentation performance of our approach.

40|$|The work {{described}} {{consists of}} two parts. In the first part, a survey is performed to assess {{the state of the}} art in rotor balancing technology as it applies to Army gas turbine engines and associated power transmission hardware. The second part evaluates thermal spray processes for <b>balancing</b> <b>weight</b> addition in an automated balancing procedure. The industry survey reveals that: (1) computerized balancing equipment is valuable to reduce errors, improve balance quality, and provide documentation; (2) slow-speed balancing is used exclusively, with no forseeable need for production high-speed balancing; (3) automated procedures are desired; and (4) thermal spray balancing is viewed with cautious optimism whereas laser balancing is viewed with concern for flight propulsion hardware. The FARE method (Fuel/Air Repetitive Explosion) was selected for experimental evaluation of bond strength and fatigue strength. Material combinations tested were tungsten carbide on stainless steel (17 - 4), Inconel 718 on Inconel 718, and Triballoy 800 on Inconel 718.

40|$|ALSTOM Power in Västerås, Sweden {{have for}} some time {{investigated}} the possibility to balance a generator rotor on site after rewinding. After extensive testing and investigations {{it was found that}} it would be theoretical possible. One of the problems left to solve was how to mount the <b>balancing</b> <b>weight</b> on to the rotor inside the air gap of the generator. This has to be solved before the overhead goal of balancing on site is going to be possible. This thesis work is a continuation of the results that emerge during the course “creative product development” at Luleå Technical University 2004 - 2005 when a project group received the same question at issue to investigate. The work started with analysing the work and result this group came up with. Based on that we analysed if some of the these ideas is possible to develop or to be improved. The goal with the work is to manufacture a prototype that works and be implemented in ALSTOM as a service to offer to the customers. All solutions have been discussed together with the R&D department at ALSTOM to avoid the biggest errors that can occur merging different technical areas. This has also given us an insight how ALSTOM earlier has thought about some to the problems that we have been facing during the work. The work have followed the product development process designed by Karl T. Ulrich and Steven D. Eppinger in the book “Product Design and Development”. After the first investigating steps we started to work in a 3 D-envieroment with the software IDEAS. Before the prototype was sent to production a number of simulations in 3 D-space was performed to ensure that the physical dimensions would not be a problem. Finally the production was outsourced to an external company specialized on making prototype models. With the final product produced a number of tests have been carried out to verify our simulations and assumptions. These tests have given the results that ALSTOM was looking for and probably during 2007 ALSTOM will start selling the service balancing on site. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
