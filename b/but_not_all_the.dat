5|$|The SPARS enjoyed {{success in}} the work place, but they also {{suffered}} a degree of intolerance at times. On more than one occasion, male guardsmen would {{make the point that}} the USCG had struggled along without women for over 150 years. Attitudes toward them ranged from enthusiasm and amusement to open hostility. <b>But</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> objections were personal or petty. Many of the men simply failed to see the need for women in the service, while others felt it was an unnecessary expense. However, if the women were equal to the job the men were willing to give them their due. Many men, regulars and reservists, supported them, taught them the ropes, and gave them encouragement.|$|E

Civil partnerships can take place on any approved premise in the UK and in approved religious venues in England and Wales since 2011 (though religious venues are not compelled), but cannot include religious readings, music or symbols. Adultery and non-consummation are also not grounds for the dissolution of a civil partnership.|$|E
25|$|At 10.50am, {{commander}} Kölle {{decided to}} make an emergency landing on a reclaimed island near Laragne Buech, north of Sisteron {{in the region of}} Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur in south-eastern France as he knew he couldn't keep his ship in the air much longer. The commander steered his ship into the dry bed of a river, but the zeppelin bounced up again, losing one of her propellers on impact.

After burning the aircraft, the crew of 17 men along with the first officer and commander Kölle were taken into custody as prisoners of war.|$|E

Prior to this episode, most of Glees musical performances were cover versions, and by October 2009 {{he had received}} offers from multiple songwriters willing to devise original tracks. At the time, he stated that Diane Warren would write two ballads for the show, and if successful, Glee may continue to use original music in the future, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time. These plans {{did not come to}} fruition, nor did a December 2009 claim by OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder that he had been recruited by Glees music supervisor, Adam Anders, to write an original song for the series. Murphy later stated that he planned to showcase original music during the second season, aiming to find a way for this to occur organically, as: [...] "It wouldn’t work [...] if they just broke out and started singing their own songs. You wouldn't get it. I {{think it has to be}} an assignment." ...|$|E
500|$|Extreme {{amounts of}} {{rainfall}} were produced over Alabama. Dauphin Island {{had the highest}} amount of rainfall, 37.75inches (959mm) reported by the HPC. [...] Dauphin Island Sea Lab recorded 36.71inches (932mm) of rain, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> rain may have recorded in the rain gauge at this location, so it is possible the rainfall may have been underestimated. Doppler weather radar estimates show that around 43inches (1,090mm) of rain fell {{off the coast of}} Dauphin Island. A storm surge of over 6.5feet (1.98m) occurred off Highway 182, midway between Gulf Shores and Fort Morgan, in addition to the rainfall. Unusually, when the storm stalled off the coast of Alabama, prevailing northerly winds forced the water out of Mobile Bay, causing tides to be twofeet (0.61m) below normal. Observers noted that, if river channels had not remained, it would have been possible to walk across the bay unhindered by water. Additionally, a four-story condominium project that was under construction in Gulf Shores crashed due to high winds. [...] In addition, three tornadoes occurred in Alabama, one being in Orange Beach, another in Opelika, while the other one occurred in Alabama Port. There were some other tornadoes that also caused minimal damage.|$|E

2500|$|Although mythical {{elements}} {{are not so}} prominent in Exodus as in Genesis, ancient legends have an influence on the book's content: for example, {{the story of the}} infant Moses's salvation from the Nile is based on an earlier legend of king Sargon of Akkad, while the story of the parting of the Red Sea trades on Mesopotamian creation mythology. [...] Similarly, the Covenant Code (the law code in Exodus 20:22–23:33) has some similarities in both content and structure with the Laws of Hammurabi. These influences serve to reinforce the conclusion that the Book of Exodus originated in the exiled Jewish community of 6th-century BCE Babylon, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> sources are Mesopotamian: the story of Moses's flight to Midian following the murder of the Egyptian overseer may draw on the Egyptian Story of Sinuhe.|$|E

This first occurs in the {{otherwise}} monochrome Andrei Rublev, which features a color epilogue of Rublev's authentic religious icon paintings.

In 1966, in an interview conducted shortly after finishing Andrei Rublev, Tarkovsky dismissed color film as a [...] "commercial gimmick" [...] and {{cast doubt on the}} idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color. He claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time, and that color should therefore be used in film mainly to emphasize certain moments, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time, as this distracts the viewer. To him, films in color were like moving paintings or photographs, which are too beautiful to be a realistic depiction of life.|$|E
