25|$|By 10 November, French {{opposition}} to the Torch landings had ceased, creating a military vacuum in Tunisia. On 9 November, Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson took command of the Eastern Task Force in Algiers, which was renamed the British First Army. Anderson ordered troops eastward to seize the ports of <b>Bougie,</b> Philippeville and Bône and the airfield at Djedjelli, preliminary to advancing into Tunisia. Allied planners had ruled out an assault landing in Tunisia, {{because of a lack}} of troops and the threat from the air; the Allies needed to advance before the Axis could reinforce Tunis. On 11 November, the British 36th Infantry Brigade had landed unopposed at <b>Bougie</b> but supply difficulties meant Djedjelli was only reached by road on 13 November. Bône airfield was occupied following a parachute drop by 3rd Parachute Battalion and this was followed up on 12 November by No. 6 Commando seizing the port.|$|E

25|$|In 1510, {{the three}} {{brothers}} raided Cape Passero in Sicily and repulsed a Spanish attack on <b>Bougie,</b> Oran and Algiers. In August 1511 they raided the areas around Reggio Calabria in southern Italy. In August 1512 the exiled ruler of <b>Bougie</b> invited the brothers {{to drive out}} the Spaniards, and during the battle Oruç lost his left arm. This incident earned him the nickname Gümüş Kol (Silver Arm in Turkish), {{in reference to the}} silver prosthetic device which he used in place of his missing limb. Later that year the three brothers raided the coasts of Andalusia in Spain, capturing a galliot of the Lomellini family of Genoa who owned the Tabarca island in that area. They subsequently landed on Menorca and captured a coastal castle, and then headed towards Liguria and captured four Genoese galleys near Genoa. The Genoese sent a fleet to liberate their ships, but the brothers captured their flagship as well. After capturing a total of 23 ships in less than a month, the brothers sailed back to La Goulette.|$|E
25|$|Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (1897–1989) {{achieved}} significant {{advances in}} techniques for tracheal intubation when he introduced his new curved laryngoscope blade in 1943. The Macintosh blade remains {{to this day}} {{the most widely used}} laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation. In 1949, Macintosh published a case report describing the novel use of a gum elastic urinary catheter as an endotracheal tube introducer to facilitate difficult tracheal intubation. Inspired by Macintosh's report, P. Hex Venn (who was at that time the anesthetic advisor to the British firm Eschmann Bros. & Walsh, Ltd.) set about developing an endotracheal tube introducer based on this concept. Venn's design was accepted in March 1973, and {{what became known as the}} Eschmann endotracheal tube introducer went into production later that year. The material of Venn's design was different from that of a gum elastic <b>bougie</b> in that it had two layers: a core of tube woven from polyester threads and an outer resin layer. This provided more stiffness but maintained the flexibility and the slippery surface. Other differences were the length (the new introducer was , which is much longer than the gum elastic <b>bougie)</b> and the presence of a 35° curved tip, permitting it to be steered around obstacles.|$|E
25|$|Andrea Doria {{managed to}} find a safer harbour for the {{remainder}} of the fleet at Cape Matifu, 5 miles east of Algiers. He enjoined Charles V to abandon his position and join him in Matifu, which Charles V did with great difficulty. From there, still oppressed by the weather, the remaining troops sailed to <b>Bougie,</b> still a Spanish harbour at that time. Charles could only depart for the open sea on 23 November. Throwing his horses overboard, Charles abandoned his army and sailed home. He finally reached Cartagena, in southeast Spain, on 3 December.|$|E

25|$|Spain {{captured}} and occupied several ports in North Africa, including Mers-el-Kebir (1505), Oran (1509), Tripoli (1510), and <b>Bougie</b> (1510); Spain also established treaty relations {{with a half}} dozen others. Among these agreements were ones with Algiers (1510), which included Spanish occupation of the off-shore island Peñón de Argel, with Tlemcen (1511), a city about 40km. inland, and with Tunis, whose Spanish alliance lasted on-and-off for decades. Near Tunis, the port of Goletta was later occupied by Spanish forces who built there a large and strong presidio; they also constructed an aqueduct to Tunis {{for use by the}} kasbah.|$|E
25|$|The Fatimid {{movement}} had originated locally in al-Maghrib, {{based on the}} strength of the Kotama Berbers in Kabylia (Setif, south of <b>Bougie,</b> eastern Algeria). The two founders of the movement were recent immigrants from the Islamic east: Abu 'Abdulla ash-Shi'i, originally from San'a in Yemen; and, arriving from Salamiyah in Syria, 'Ubaidalla Sa'id. These two were religious dissidents who had come west to al-Magrib specifically to propagate their beliefs. The later, 'Ubaidalla Sa'id, claimed descent from Fatimah the daughter of Muhammad; he was to proclaim himself the Fatimid Mahdi. Their religious affiliation was the Ismaili branch of the Shia.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{maritime customs}} ports were then: Tunis, Sfax, Mahdia, Jerba, and Gabés (all in Tunisia); Oran, <b>Bougie</b> (Béjaïa), and Bône (Annaba) (in Algeria); and Tripoli (in Libya). At such ports generally, the imports were off loaded {{and transferred to}} a customs area from where they were deposited in a sealed wharehouse, or funduq, until the duties and fees were paid. The amount imposed varied, usually five or ten percent. The Tunis customs service was a stratified bureaucracy. At its head was often {{a member of the}} ruling nobility or musharif, called al-Caid, who not only managed the staff collecting duties but also might negotiate commercial agreements, conclude treaties, and act as judge in legal disputes involving foreigners.|$|E
25|$|A prosperous economy {{permitted}} a refined and luxurious court {{life and the}} construction of the new palace cities of al-'Abbasiya (809), and Raqada (877), where were situated the new residences of the ruling emir. The architecture of Ifriqiya was later imitated further west in Fez, Tlemcen, and <b>Bougie.</b> The location of these palace cities for Aghlabid government was purposely was outside of the sway of Kairouan, which city had become dominated by Muslim clerical institutions, which were independent of emir's control. Yet generally Ifriqiyah during the era under the Aghlabid Dynasty (799-909) for the most part continued its leading rôle in the region, in the newly installed Muslim Maghrib, due generally to its peace and stability, recognized cultural achievements, and material prosperity.|$|E
25|$|After {{the conquest}} of Melilla in 1497, the Spanish expansionist policy in North Africa was {{developed}} during the regency of Ferdinand the Catholic in Castile, stimulated by the Cardinal Cisneros, once the Reconquista in the Iberian Peninsula was finished. That way, several towns and outposts in the North African coast were conquered and occupied by Castile: Mazalquivir (1505), Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera (1508), Oran (1509), Algiers (1510), <b>Bougie</b> and Tripoli (1510). Tripoli was taken on 24-25 July, the feast of St. James, protector of Spain; the claim was made that 10,000 Muslims were killed and many captured. In the Atlantic coast, Spain took possession of the outpost of Santa Cruz de la Mar Pequeña (1476) {{with support from the}} Canary Islands, and it was retained until 1525 with the consent of the treaty of Cintra (1509).|$|E
25|$|After {{the conquest}} of Tripoli to the Knights of Malta by the Ottoman admiral Turgut Reis in 1551, and the fall of <b>Bougie</b> to the {{governor}} of Algiers, Salih Reis, in 1555, the towns of Oran and Mers El Kébir remained as the only Christian strongholds in Barbary, along with the island of La Goulette, which helped fight the Ottoman and Moorish pirates who constantly plundered and razed the coasts of Naples, Sicily and the Levant. An Ottoman fleet composed of 50 galleys {{under the command of}} the renegade Hasan Corso besieged both cities in the Siege of Oran in 1556, but the Sultan Suleiman ordered lift the siege to withdraw the galleys to serve in the Eastern Mediterranean, so both Mers El Kébir and Oran remained in Spanish hands despite the poor state of their defenses.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the anarchy in Zirid Ifriqiya (Tunisia) made it {{a target}} for the Norman kingdom in Sicily, who between 1134 and 1148 had taken control of Mahdia, Gabès, Sfax, and the island of Jerba, all of which served as centers for {{commerce}} and trade. The only strong Muslim power then in the Maghreb {{was that of the}} newly emerging Almohads, led by their caliph a Berber Abd al-Mu'min. He responded with several military campaigns into the eastern Maghrib which absorbed the Hammaid and Zirid states, and removed the Christians. Thus in 1152 he first attacked and occupied <b>Bougie</b> (in eastern Algeria), ruled by the Sanhaja Hammadids. His armies next entered Zirid Ifriqiya, a disorganized territory, taking Tunis. His armies also besieged Mahdia, held by Normans of Sicily, compelling these Christians to negotiate their withdrawal in 1160. Yet Christian merchants, e.g., from Genoa and Pisa, had already arrived to stay in Ifriqiya, so that such a foreign merchant presence (Italian and Aragonese) continued.|$|E
25|$|There {{they built}} three more galliots and a {{gunpowder}} production facility. In 1513 they captured four English ships {{on their way}} to France, raided Valencia where they captured four more ships, and then headed for Alicante and captured a Spanish galley near Málaga. In 1513 and 1514 the three brothers engaged Spanish squadrons on several other occasions and moved to their new base in Cherchell, east of Algiers. In 1514, with 12 galliots and 1,000 Turks, they destroyed two Spanish fortresses at <b>Bougie,</b> and when a Spanish fleet under the command of Miguel de Gurrea, viceroy of Majorca, arrived for assistance, they headed towards Ceuta and raided that city before capturing Jijel in Algeria, which was under Genoese control. They later captured Mahdiya in Tunisia. Afterwards they raided the coasts of Sicily, Sardinia, the Balearic Islands and the Spanish mainland, capturing three large ships there. In 1515 they captured several galleons, a galley and three barques at Majorca. Still in 1515 Oruç sent precious gifts to the Ottoman Sultan Selim I who, in return, sent him two galleys and two swords embellished with diamonds. In 1516, joined by Kurtoğlu, the brothers besieged the Castle of Elba, before heading once more towards Liguria where they captured 12 ships and damaged 28 others.|$|E
25|$|The entire Maghrib, {{as well as}} Tunisia {{under the}} early Hafsids, enjoyed an era of {{prosperity}} due {{to the rise of}} Saharan-Sudanese as well as the Mediterranean trade, the latter including trade with Europe. Across the region, repeated buy and sell dealings with Christians {{led to the development of}} practices and structured arrangements at were crafted to ensure security, customs revenue, and commercial profit. The principal customs ports were then: Tunis, Sfax, Mahdia, Jerba, and Gabés (in modern Tunisia); Oran, <b>Bougie</b> (Bejaia), and Bône (Annaba) (in modern Algeria); and Tripoli (in modern Libya). Generally at such ports, the imports were off loaded and transferred to a customs area from where they were deposited in a sealed warehouse, or funduq, until the duties and fees were paid.

The amount of the duties varied, usually five or ten percent. It was possible for an arriving ship to deliver its goods and pick up the return cargo in several days time. Christian merchants of the Mediterranean, usually organized by their city–of–origin, set up and maintained their own trading facilities in these North African customs ports to handle the flow of merchandise and marketing.|$|E

By 1504 they had entered into a privateer agreement with the Hafsid sultan Mohammad b. al-Hasan (1493–1526). By it the 'prizes' (ships, cargoes, and captives) were to be shared. The brothers operated from Goletta they ran similar operations from Djerba in the south, where Aruj was governor. During these years in Spain, those who remained non-Christian were required to leave, including Muslims; at times Aruj employed his ships to transport a great many Moorish Andalucians to North Africa, especially Tunisia. For these efforts Aruj won praise and many Muslim recruits. Twice Aruj joined the Hafsids in unsuccessful assaults on <b>Bougie,</b> held by Spain.
