50|$|Importantly, {{the bottom}} edge of the prism must be roughly {{parallel}} to the ground in order to provide an accurate estimate on sloped ground. Wedge prisms can be difficult to use in wet conditions due to the effect water droplets have on the optical properties of the glass. Wedge prisms come in different colors such as clear or amber. The amber provides the same function as the clear wedge prism, only it reduces glare and is easier to use on overcast or cloudy days. Operating a wedge prism is one technique used in forestry today because, the wedge prism is simple, relatively inexpensive, portable, and as accurate as other angle gauges when properly calibrated and used properly. One simply holds the prism directly over the plot center, and by focusing on a tree, the refracted light will offset the trunk of the tree. The wedge prism is used to take measurements in both land management and in timber procurement. Other tools often used to accompany the wedge prism in taking forest inventory are clinometers, <b>Biltmore</b> <b>sticks,</b> relascopes, and Diameter Tapes.|$|R

TITLE: An Evaluation of Growth Simulation Models for Non-Industrial Private Forest Stewardship Planning in Southern Illinois MAJOR PROFESSOR: DR: Andrew Carver After timber is harvested, changes occur {{that should be}} recorded to provide guidelines and justification for future forest stewardship practices. In 1997, an inventory of the Scherrer property timber was conducted in order to record the impacts that might result in changes in a stand following a timber harvest and a timber stand improvement project. The timber was harvested {{in the summer of}} 1998 using a 20 -inch diameter limit, with a lower limit on sugar maples and hickory species. Pre-harvest and post-harvest data were collected using a <b>Biltmore</b> Cruising <b>Stick,</b> diameter tape, 1002 ̆ 7 tape measure, forester 2 ̆ 7 s compass, and a 10 -factor wedge prism. Pre-harvest data was collected on 71 plots, and post-harvest data was collected on 61 plots. The data were analyzed using the SILVAH computer program for pre-harvest and post-harvest data. The Ned program was used to run four growth simulators. The growth simulators used were FIBER, NW-TWIGS, SILVAH, and OAKSIM, each programmed for a five year time horizon after harvest. The actual relative density measured before treatment was 77 percent per acre. The field-measured post-harvest density decreased to 57 percent. The computer simulated relative density ranged between 31 to 69 percent per acre. The pre-harvest board-foot volume was 8266 International ¼ 2 ̆ 7 scale. The actual field-measured post-harvest volume was 6591 board feet per acre. The range for simulated boardfoot volumes was 2395 to 6295 board feet per acre. The results of the study support the validity of using the NW-TWIGS simulator for stewardship planning in Southern Illinois. The NW-TWIGS model yielded results closest to the actual field measurements. FIBER and SILVAH produced the same result. OAKSIM was the least. A study of the hardwood regeneration indicates that, at present, ash is the dominant species overall. The white oak, hickory, sugar maple, and black oak volumes decreased in composition within stands. Ash, northern red oak, cherrybark oak, sweetgum, and beech composition remained largely unchanged. Whereas yellow poplar, black walnut and the chestnut oak group increased in percent presence within stands...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Biltmore</b> <b>stick</b> {{is a tool}} used {{to measure}} various tree dimensions, such as {{diameter}} at breast height and height. It looks much like an everyday yardstick. A <b>Biltmore</b> <b>stick</b> {{is considered to be}} only marginally accurate. Some foresters use the tool regularly, however, many prefer to use more accurate tools such as a diameter tape to measure diameter at breast height (DBH) and a clinometer to measure height. On {{the other end of the}} spectrum, some foresters consider the use of a <b>Biltmore</b> <b>stick</b> to be no more accurate than their own visual estimates (based on experience estimating the height and DBH of trees), and make it practice for their surveys to be largely completed in this manner.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Biltmore</b> <b>stick</b> is {{so named}} because it was {{developed}} at the Biltmore Estate, {{one of the first}} places in the US where forestry was applied as a science. Gifford Pinchot, future first chief of the US forest service, and then Carl A. Schenck were hired in the 1890s to restore 125000 acre of land around the Biltmore estate to a healthy forest. Schenck was the developer of the <b>Biltmore</b> <b>stick.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Biltmore</b> <b>stick</b> {{uses the}} {{principle}} of similar triangles. Similar triangles involve using identical angles but different side lengths.|$|E
50|$|To measure height, {{the user}} of the <b>Biltmore</b> <b>stick</b> stands a fixed {{distance}} from the tree, usually 66 ft in the United States. The stick is held upright, with the back edge of the stick facing the user. The back edge of the stick will be marked with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 log markings, indicating the number of 16-foot logs in a tree. The bottom of the stick should line up with {{the bottom of the}} tree's trunk. The height of the tree is how high the tree goes up on the stick to a merchantable top.|$|E
