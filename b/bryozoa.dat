5|$|Parasitic infestations, stings, and bites {{in humans}} {{are caused by}} several groups of organisms {{belonging}} to the following phyla: Annelida, Arthropoda, <b>Bryozoa,</b> Chordata, Cnidaria, Cyanobacteria, Echinodermata, Nemathelminthes, Platyhelminthes, and Protozoa.|$|E
5|$|Other fauna, such as hydrozoa, <b>bryozoa</b> {{and brittle}} stars, often dwell among the {{branches}} of gorgonian and coral colonies. The pygmy seahorse not only makes certain species of gorgonians its home, but closely resembles its host and is thus well camouflaged. Some organisms have an obligate relationship with their host species. The mollusc Simnialena marferula is only found on the sea whip Leptogorgia virgulata, is coloured like it and has sequestered its defensive chemicals, and the nudibranch Tritonia wellsi is another obligate symbiont, its feathery gills resembling the tentacles of the polyps.|$|E
5|$|Fractals are {{infinitely}} self-similar, iterated mathematical constructs having fractal dimension. Infinite iteration is {{not possible}} in nature so all 'fractal' patterns are only approximate. For example, the leaves of ferns and umbellifers (Apiaceae) are only self-similar (pinnate) to 2, 3 or 4 levels. Fern-like growth patterns occur in plants and in animals including <b>bryozoa,</b> corals, hydrozoa like the air fern, Sertularia argentea, and in non-living things, notably electrical discharges. Lindenmayer system fractals can model different patterns of tree growth by varying {{a small number of}} parameters including branching angle, distance between nodes or branch points (internode length), and number of branches per branch point.|$|E
5|$|As {{often the}} most {{abundant}} apex predator within its ecosystem, the blacktip reef shark {{plays a major role}} in structuring inshore ecological communities. Its diet is composed primarily of small teleost fishes, including mullet, groupers, grunters, jacks, mojarras, wrasses, surgeonfish, and smelt-whitings. Groups of blacktip reef sharks in the Indian Ocean have been observed herding schools of mullet against the shore for easier feeding. Squid, octopus, cuttlefish, shrimp, and mantis shrimp are also taken, as well as carrion and smaller sharks and rays, though this is rare. Off northern Australia, this species is known to consume sea snakes, including Acrochordus granulatus, Hydrelaps darwiniensis, Hydrophis spp. and Lapemis hardwickii. Sharks off Palmyra Atoll have been documented preying on seabird chicks that have fallen out of their nests into the water. Miscellaneous items that have been found inside the stomachs of this species include algae, turtle grass, coral, hydrozoa, <b>bryozoa,</b> rats, and stones.|$|E
25|$|Provincetown Harbor {{supports}} {{a wide variety}} of marine life from algae, seagrasses and plankton through <b>bryozoa,</b> hydroids, echinoderms, crustaceans, mollusks, fish, birds, marine mammals, and other animals.|$|E
25|$|For example, some colonial organisms, such as <b>Bryozoa</b> (especially the Cheilostomata) have {{relatively}} large colonies, but are classified by fine skeletal {{details of the}} small individuals of the colony.|$|E
25|$|In {{some species}} of <b>Bryozoa,</b> {{the first part}} of the stomach forms a muscular gizzard lined with chitinous teeth that crush {{armoured}} prey such as diatoms. Wave-like peristaltic contractions then move the food through the stomach for digestion.|$|E
25|$|Early Paleozoic climates were {{warmer than}} today, {{but the end}} of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge {{continent}} Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, <b>Bryozoa</b> and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.|$|E
25|$|The {{project began}} with {{work on a}} few, mostly slim volumes in which a single senior {{specialist}} in a distinct field of invertebrate paleozoology would summarize one particular group. As a result, each publication became a comprehensive compilation of everything known at that time for each group. Examples of {{this stage of the}} project are Part G. <b>Bryozoa,</b> by Ray S. Bassler (the first volume, published in 1953), and Part P. Arthropoda Part 2, the Chelicerata by Alexander Petrunkevitch (1955/1956).|$|E
25|$|The marine {{invertebrate}} collection {{is composed of}} specimens from taxa other than crustaceans and molluscs. It includes Annelida, Brachiopoda, <b>Bryozoa,</b> Cestoda, Cephalochordata, Hemichordata, Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Echinodermata, Echiura, Entoprocta, Nematoda, Foraminifera, Phoronida, Rotifera, Turbellaria, Trematoda, Urochordata, Porifera, Priapulida and Sipuncula. Specimens are mostly marine (Western Atlantic and Antarctic Ocean), but some are neotropical freshwater and terrestrial. Containing nearly 200,000 lots and 200 type specimens, the collection was built with the efforts of late-19th-century researchers including Ernst and Eveline Marcus, Gilberto Righi, Luis Roberto Tommasi, Antonio Sérgio Ferreira Ditadi, Jeanete Maron Ramos, Gertrude Rita Kloss and Sérgio de Almeida Rodrigues.|$|E
25|$|The Cesar-Ranchería Basin is {{underlain}} by Neoproterozoic basement. The Sierra Nevada Metamorphic Belt {{was formed}} during the Grenville orogeny, when the supercontinent Rodinia was formed {{due to the}} collision of Amazonia, Baltica and Laurentia. The granulites and gneisses of the complex have been dated to 1.5 to 1.0 Ga. The phyllites and quartzites of the Perijá Formation were formed during the Early Paleozoic and {{are related to the}} Caledonian orogeny. The shales of the Río Cachirí Group were deposited in the Devonian and contain abundant fossils of brachiopods, <b>bryozoa,</b> corals and crinoids. The formation is time-equivalent with the fossiliferous Floresta and Cuche Formations of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense. The sediments were deposited in an epicontinental sea {{at the edge of the}} Paleo-Tethys Ocean, the last remnant of the Rheic Ocean.|$|E
25|$|The Lophotrochozoa, evolved within Protostomia, {{include two}} of the most {{successful}} animal phyla, the Mollusca and Annelida. The former, which is the second-largest animal phylum by number of described species, includes animals such as snails, clams, and squids, and the latter comprises the segmented worms, such as earthworms and leeches. These two groups have long been considered close relatives because of the common presence of trochophore larvae, but the annelids were considered closer to the arthropods because they are both segmented. Now, this is generally considered convergent evolution, owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two phyla. Lophotrochozoa also includes the Nemertea or ribbon worms, the Sipuncula, and several phyla that have a ring of ciliated tentacles around the mouth, called a lophophore. These were traditionally grouped together as the lophophorates. but it now appears that the lophophorate group may be paraphyletic, with some closer to the nemerteans and some to the molluscs and annelids. They include the Brachiopoda or lamp shells, which are prominent in the fossil record, the Entoprocta, the Phoronida, and possibly the <b>Bryozoa</b> or moss animals.|$|E
500|$|Nemerteans' affinities with Annelida (including Echiura, Pogonophora, Vestimentifera {{and perhaps}} Sipuncula) and Mollusca make the ribbon-worms members of Lophotrochozoa, which [...] include {{about half of}} the extant animal phyla. Lophotrochozoa groups: those animals that feed using a lophophore (Brachiopoda, <b>Bryozoa,</b> Phoronida, Entoprocta); phyla in which most members' embryos develop into trochophore larvae (for example Annelida and Mollusca); and some other phyla (such as Platyhelminthes, Sipuncula, Gastrotricha, Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, Nemertea, Phoronida, Platyhelminthes and Rotifera). These groupings are based on {{molecular}} phylogeny, which compares sections of organisms DNA and RNA. While analyses by molecular phylogeny are confident that members of Lophotrochozoa are more closely related to each other than of non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that three fossil species may be nemerteans, but none is confirmed. Traditional taxonomy divides the phylum in two classes, Anopla ("unarmed" [...] – their proboscises do not have a little dagger) with two orders, and Enopla ("armed" [...] with a dagger) with two orders. However, it is now accepted that Anopla are paraphyletic (have given rise to another group), as one order is more closely related to Enopla than to the other order of Anopla. The phylum Nemertea is monophyletic. Its synapomorphies include the rhynchocoel and eversible proboscis. Traditional taxonomy says that nemerteans are closely related to flatworms and that both are relatively [...] "primitive" [...] acoelomates. Now both phyla are regarded as members of the Lophotrochozoa, a very large [...] "super-phylum" [...] that also includes molluscs, annelids, brachiopods, <b>bryozoa</b> and many other protostomes.|$|E
500|$|Molecular {{phylogeny}} {{indicates that}} Phoronida {{are closely related}} to Brachiopoda, but <b>Bryozoa</b> (Ectoprocta) are not closely related to this group, despite using a similar lophophore for feeding and respiration. This implies that the traditional definition [...] "Lophophorata" [...] is not monophyletic. Recently the term [...] "Lophophorata" [...] has been applied only to the Phoronida and Brachiopoda, and Halanych thinks this change will cause confusion. Some analyses regard Phoronida and Brachiopoda as sister-groups, while others place Phoronida as a sub-group within Brachiopoda, implying that Brachiopoda is paraphyletic. Cohen and Weydman's analysis (2005) concludes that phoronids are a sub-group of inarticulate brachiopods (those in which the hinge between the two valves have no teeth and sockets) and sister-group of the other inarticulate [...] sub-groups. The authors also suggest that the ancestors of molluscs and the brachiopod+phoronid clade diverged between 900 Ma and 560 Ma, most probably about 685 Ma.|$|E

2500|$|Miami-Dade County is {{only about}} [...] above sea level.

Eastern Dade is composed of Oolite limestone while western Dade is composed mostly of <b>Bryozoa.</b> Miami-Dade is among the last areas of Florida to be created and populated with fauna and flora, mostly in the Pleistocene.|$|E
2500|$|In warm, clear {{tropical}} waters corals {{are more}} abundant than towards the poles where the waters are cold. Calcium carbonate contributors, including plankton (such as coccoliths and planktic foraminifera), coralline algae, sponges, brachiopods, echinoderms, <b>bryozoa</b> and mollusks, are typically found {{in shallow water}} environments where sunlight and filterable food are more abundant. [...] Cold-water carbonates do exist at higher latitudes but have a very slow growth rate. The calcification processes are changed by ocean acidification.|$|E
2500|$|The Iguape Formation is [...] {{thick and}} {{consists}} of bioclastic calcarenites and calcirudites, containing <b>bryozoa,</b> echinoids, corals, foraminifera, fragmented shells, and algae remains. They are interbedded with grey-greenish clays, siltstones, marls and variegated grey fine-to-medium grained conglomerates. These facies are interbedded with and change laterally to the Marambaia Formation. The depositional environment {{is thought to be}} a marine carbonate platform, influenced by the arrival of alluvial clastics in the most proximal areas. Biostratigraphic data from planktonic foraminifera, calcareous nanofossils and palynomorphs indicate a Tertiary age.|$|E
2500|$|Sea {{levels in}} the Devonian were {{generally}} high. Marine faunas were dominated by <b>bryozoa,</b> diverse and abundant brachiopods, the enigmatic hederelloids, microconchids and corals.

Among vertebrates, jawless armoured fish (ostracoderms) declined in diversity, while the jawed fish (gnathostomes) simultaneously increased in both the sea and fresh water. Armoured placoderms were numerous during the lower stages of the Devonian Period but became extinct in the Late Devonian, perhaps because of competition for food against the other fish species. Early cartilaginous (Chondrichthyes) and bony fishes (Osteichthyes) also become diverse and played a large role within the Devonian seas.
