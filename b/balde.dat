5|$|Celtic F.C.'s {{participation}} in the 2002–03 UEFA Cup came {{as a result of}} their defeat in the UEFA Champions League third qualifying round against FC Basel (3–3 aggregate score with the Swiss team progressing to the group stage on away goals). During the 2003 UEFA Cup competition, Celtic goalkeeper Rab Douglas and defender Bobo <b>Balde</b> appeared in twelve matches, which led the team in that category. They both missed the 2nd leg of the first round against FK Sūduva. Douglas conceded twelve goals and had six clean sheets. Celtic outscored opponents 27 to 12 on their run to the final. Striker Henrik Larsson scored eleven goals, including a hat-trick in the first game against FK Sūduva.|$|E
5|$|Normal time {{ended with}} the game at 2–2. The ensuing periods of extra time saw {{defensive}} football from both sides; Celtic was down to ten men when Bobo <b>Balde</b> was dismissed on 95 minutes after his second yellow card. On 112 minutes, Derlei reacted quickest to a Robert Douglas block and rounded McNamara make it 3–2 for Porto. Porto managed to hang on even after having Nuno Valente sent off just {{before the end of}} extra-time, thus ensuring that Porto had ended their 16-year wait between European trophies. It was Porto's first UEFA Cup win, and they were also the first team to win a trophy on the silver goal rule.|$|E

5|$|Feyenoord {{started the}} 2013–14 Eredivisie {{campaign}} on the road against PEC Zwolle on 4 August 2013 with a stoppage time loss. Later that week Feyenoord was drawn against European debutant FC Kuban Krasnodar from Russia for the play-off round of the Europa league. They finished their home opener on 11 August with nine men, {{which resulted in a}} three-goal loss against FC Twente. Later that week the club announced it had loaned forward Samuel Armenteros for one season from Anderlecht. The following Sunday they played De Klassieker away and lost by one goal after an early lead. Feyenoord opened their European season 22 August 2013 in Russia and lost to FC Kuban Krasnodar, with Ibrahima <b>Baldé</b> scoring the only goal of the match. Feyenoord won their second home game of the season 25 August against NAC, due to a hattrick by Graziano Pellè of which two goals were scored in two consecutive minutes. The second leg of the Europa League play-off round was played 29 August at home in De Kuip, where they lost 1–2 and were eliminated from the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The humid weather {{meant that}} the game was played at a {{relatively}} slow pace, which seemed to favour Porto. This caused a number of rash challenges from Celtic, one of which led to Joos Valgaeren getting a yellow card on 8 minutes. After this {{it was very much}} a stoic affair, until 32 minutes into the first half when Capucho played in Deco, but he could do no more than fire his shot straight at Celtic's goalkeeper Robert Douglas. Straight after this attack Celtic broke on the counter with Henrik Larsson, putting Didier Agathe through on the right, but his cross was too high for Chris Sutton. Larsson had a chance to make it 1–0 on 35 minutes, but from Sutton's assist he was unable to make enough contact with the ball. Porto came close on 41 minutes when Deco moved past Bobo <b>Baldé</b> to go one on one against Robert Douglas, who saved Deco's shot with his legs. Porto finally found a way through on 45 minutes when, after an offensive play from Deco, Derlei followed up Dmitri Alenichev's shot on target, which had been saved by Robert Douglas. This gave Porto a 1–0 lead on the stroke of half time and Derlei's 11th goal of the competition.|$|E

5000|$|In 1986, guitarist Jeremy Popoff and bassist Kevin <b>Baldes</b> met, {{and soon}} after, began playing music together. Later on, <b>Baldes</b> (16 at the time) and Popoff's brother, A. Jay (14 at the time), formed the pop metal band Razzle in 1988 with Sean Holland. The lineup {{included}} Kevin <b>Baldes</b> (bass, lead vocals), Sean Holland (guitar), and A. Jay Popoff (drums, percussion). They performed their first show on June 26, 1988, at The Troubadour. In 1989, A. Jay switched from drums to lead vocals, {{and the band}} added guitarist Jeremy Popoff and drummer Allen Shellenberger. Things began to come together in 1990, when the group released a demo tape and an EP entitled New Vibe Revolution in 1993. Razzle dissolved in 1993 and became Stain in 1994, which had a much harder and heavier sound. They released a demo tape in 1995 and eventually signed with Malicious Vinyl in 1995. After finding out the name [...] "Stain" [...] was already owned, the band changed their name to Lit.|$|R

500|$|Around 80,000 Celtic fans {{travelled}} {{to watch}} the club compete in the UEFA Cup Final, held in Seville on 21 May 2003. Played in humid weather, the first half was a somewhat stoic affair, but Porto scored just before half-time when Derlei netted Dmitri Alenichev's parried shot. Celtic levelled two minutes into the second half when Henrik Larsson headed Didier Agathe's cross from the right past goalkeeper Vitor Baiai. Porto regained the lead five minutes later when Deco's angled pass to Alenichev saw the Russian score. Again Celtic rallied, with Larsson scoring with another header, this time from an Alan Thompson corner. Celtic were however being frustrated by the referee's over-indulgence of Porto's time-wasting and their players' persistent feigning of injury. With the game tied at 22 on 90 minutes, the final went into extra time. Bobo <b>Baldé</b> was sent off on 95 minutes after his second yellow card. On 112 minutes Derlei reacted quickest to a Rab Douglas block and rounded Jackie McNamara to make it 3–2. Porto managed to hang to win the UEFA Cup. Nonetheless, the exemplary conduct {{of the thousands of}} travelling Celtic supporters received widespread praise from the people of Seville and the fans were awarded prestigious Fair Play Awards from both FIFA and UEFA [...] "for their extraordinarily loyal and sporting behaviour".|$|E
500|$|Celtic {{qualified}} for the Champions League in 2003–04, but again could only finish third in the group stages and therefore dropped into the UEFA Cup. After a straightforward aggregate win over FK Teplice, Celtic were drawn against Barcelona in the round of 16. A dramatic first leg in Glasgow saw Celtic win 1–0 through an Alan Thompson goal, but goalkeeper Rab Douglas and Barcelona's Thiago Motta were sent off during half-time for fighting in the tunnel. [...] The return match in Spain saw Celtic fielding 19-year-old reserve goalkeeper David Marshall in place of Douglas and young defender John Kennedy standing in for Bobo <b>Baldé,</b> who was also suspended. Celtic found themselves under a sustained barrage of pressure, but the two youngsters turned in outstanding performances. Marshall pulled off outstanding saves from Luis Enrique and Luis García, while Kennedy {{made a number of}} great tackles to keep Barcelona at bay. [...] Celtic held out for a scoreless draw on the night to win on aggregate and progress to the quarter-finals. Celtic's run in Europe was finally ended in the next round by another Spanish side, Villarreal, losing 3–1 on aggregate. The club went straight into the group stages for the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League, but finished bottom of their group on five points, one point behind Shakhtar Donetsk who {{qualified for}} the UEFA Cup spot, and behind Barcelona and AC Milan who progressed to the next stage of the Champions League.
