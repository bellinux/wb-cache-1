50|$|Research of {{this topic}} {{includes}} {{the design and}} assembly of devices for the direct production of solar fuels, photoelectrochemistry and its application in fuel cells, and the engineering of enzymes and photoautotrophic microorganisms for microbial biofuel and <b>biohydrogen</b> production from sunlight.|$|E
5000|$|Fermentative {{hydrogen}} production is the fermentative conversion of organic substrates to H2. Hydrogen produced {{in this manner}} is often called <b>biohydrogen.</b> The conversion is effected by bacteria and protozoa, which employ enzymes. Fermentative {{hydrogen production}} {{is one of several}} anaerobic conversions.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the high}} {{carbohydrate}} content, crop residues {{can be considered as}} an appropriate feedstock to produce biofuels. Some algorithms have been developed to estimate the potential capacity of biofuel production from agricultural residues. Based on the experimental data obtained from a study that used ethanol organosolv pretreated rice straw to produce <b>biohydrogen</b> using Enterobacter aerogenes, the annual global amount of collectable rice straw (not total produced straw) for biofuel production was estimated about 249 million tonnes, that could approximately produce 355.78 kilotonnes of hydrogen and 11.32 million tonnes of lignin by the proposed organosolv technology and it was found that China contributes to about 32% of global potential capacity to produce <b>biohydrogen</b> from rice straw.|$|E

50|$|Dark {{fermentation}} is the fermentative {{conversion of}} organic substrate to <b>biohydrogen.</b> It {{is a complex}} process manifested by diverse groups of bacteria, involving a series of biochemical reactions using three steps similar to anaerobic conversion. Dark fermentation differs from photofermentation in that it proceeds without the presence of light.|$|E
50|$|Competing for <b>biohydrogen,</b> {{at least}} for {{commercial}} applications, are many mature industrial processes. Hydrogen is usually derived from fossil fuels by steam reforming of natural gas - {{sometimes referred to as}} steam methane reforming (SMR) - is the most common method of producing bulk hydrogen at about 95% of the world production.|$|E
50|$|As {{the price}} of fossil fuels {{increases}} and reserves diminish, biofuel production {{is seen as a}} viable contribution to current. as well as future energy demands, Halanaerobium hydrogeninformans can use several pure sugars for hydrogen production, Hence, this bacterium can potentially increase the efficiency and efficacy of <b>biohydrogen</b> production from renewable biomass resources.|$|E
50|$|<b>Biohydrogen</b> can be {{produced}} in bioreactors that utilize feedstocks, the most common feedstock being waste streams. The process involves bacteria feeding on hydrocarbons and exhaling hydrogen and CO2. The CO2 can be sequestered successfully by several methods, leaving hydrogen gas. A prototype hydrogen bioreactor using waste as a feedstock is in operation at Welch's grape juice factory in North East, Pennsylvania (U.S.).|$|E
5000|$|Anoxygenic {{photosynthetic}} bacteria do not generate oxygen during photosynthesis, having {{only a single}} photosystem which cannot split water. Nitrogenase is expressed under nitrogen limitation. Normally, the expression is regulated via negative feedback from the produced ammonium ion but {{in the absence of}} N2, the product is not formed, and the by-product H2 continues unabated <b>Biohydrogen.</b> Example species: Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Rhodobacter capsulatus.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Biohydrogen</b> is H2 that is {{produced}} biologically. [...] Interest {{is high in}} this technology because H2 is a clean fuel and can be readily produced from certain kinds of biomass. [...] Many challenges characterize this technology, including those intrinsic to H2, such as storage and transportation of a noncondensible gas. Hydrogen producing organisms are poisoned by O2. Yields of H2 are often low.|$|E
5000|$|For past 15 years Professor Takahashi {{has also}} been {{involved}} with hydrogen, and in the mid-90’s chaired the U.S. Secretary of Energy’s Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel, which produced the Green Hydrogen Report, which served {{as the basis for}} funding the national hydrogen research program. [...] He has widely published in this field, and currently coordinates a <b>biohydrogen</b> program funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{in policy}} analysis, {{forecasting}} future production of biofuels is key data for making better decisions. Thereby, statistical time series models {{have recently been}} developed to forecast renewable energy sources. In other research, a multiplicative decomposition method was designed to forecast future production of <b>biohydrogen.</b> The optimum length of the moving average (seasonal length) and start point, where the averages are placed, were indicated based on the best coincidence between the present forecast and actual values.|$|E

50|$|Some {{scientists}} and {{companies are going}} beyond using just the oil, and are proposing to convert fronds, empty fruit bunches and palm kernel shells harvested from oil palm plantations into renewable electricity, cellulosic ethanol, biogas, <b>biohydrogen</b> and bioplastic. Thus, by using both the biomass from the plantation {{as well as the}} processing residues from palm oil production (fibers, kernel shells, palm oil mill effluent), bioenergy from palm plantations can have an effect on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Examples of these production techniques have been registered as projects under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Utilization of {{wastewater}} as {{a potential}} substrate for <b>biohydrogen</b> production has been drawing considerable interest in recent years especially in the dark fermentation process. Industrial wastewater as a fermentative substrate for H2 production addresses most of the criteria required for substrate selection viz., availability, cost and biodegradability (Angenent, et al., 2004; Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). Chemical wastewater (Venkata Mohan, et al., 2007a,b), cattle wastewater (Tang, et al., 2008), dairy process wastewater (Venkata Mohan, et al. 2007c, Rai et al. 2012), starch hydrolysate wastewater (Chen, et al., 2008) and designed synthetic wastewater (Venkata Mohan, et al., 2007a, 2008b) {{have been reported to}} produce <b>biohydrogen</b> apart from wastewater treatment from dark fermentation processes using selectively enriched mixed cultures under acidophilic conditions. Various wastewaters viz., paper mill wastewater (Idania, et al., 2005), starch effluent (Zhang, et al., 2003), food processing wastewater (Shin et al., 2004, van Ginkel, et al., 2005), domestic wastewater (Shin, et al., 2004, 2008e), rice winery wastewater (Yu et al., 2002), distillery and molasses based wastewater (Ren, et al., 2007, Venkata Mohan, et al., 2008a), wheat straw wastes (Fan, et al., 2006) and palm oil mill wastewater (Vijayaraghavan and Ahmed, 2006) have been studied as fermentable substrates for H2 production along with wastewater treatment. Using wastewater as a fermentable substrate facilitates both wastewater treatment apart from H2 production. The efficiency of the dark fermentative H2 production process was found to depend on pre-treatment of the mixed consortia used as a biocatalyst, operating pH, and organic loading rate apart from wastewater characteristics (Venkata Mohan, et al., 2007d, 2008c, d, Vijaya Bhaskar, et al., 2008d).|$|E

50|$|Recently, {{due to the}} {{popularity}} of second generation biofuels, the organosolv process has been considered {{in the context of}} bioethanol production. Cellulose from the organosolv process is susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis into glucose followed by fermentation to dilute ethanol. The organosolv fractionation of mountain beetle killed lodgepole pine has yielded 97% conversion to glucose. Pan et al. recovered 79% of the lignin using conditions of 170 °C, 1.1% w/w H2SO4, 65% v/v ethanol for 60 minutes.Furthermore, ethanol organosolv pretreated rice straw was used to produce <b>biohydrogen</b> using Enterobacter aerogenes. The effect of temperature (120-180 °C), residence time (30-90 min), and ethanol concentration (45-75% v/v) on the hydrogen yield, residual biomass, and lignin recovery was investigated using RSM. The glucose concentration at the optimum conditions was 4.22-fold of untreated straw.|$|E

5000|$|The {{molecular}} hydrogen needed as an onboard fuel for hydrogen vehicles {{can be obtained}} through many thermochemical methods utilizing natural gas, coal (by {{a process known as}} coal gasification), liquefied petroleum gas, biomass (biomass gasification), by a process called thermolysis, or as a microbial waste product called <b>biohydrogen</b> or Biological hydrogen production. 95% of hydrogen is produced using natural gas, and 85% of hydrogen produced is used to remove sulfur from gasoline. Hydrogen can also be produced from water by electrolysis at working efficiencies in the 50-60% range for the smaller electrolysers and around 65-70% for the larger plants. Hydrogen can also be made by chemical reduction using chemical hydrides or aluminum. [...] Current technologies for manufacturing hydrogen use energy in various forms, totaling between 25 and 50 percent of the higher heating value of the hydrogen fuel, used to produce, compress or liquefy, and transmit the hydrogen by pipeline or truck.|$|E
50|$|The Green Energy Development Center has {{developed}} an anaerobic bioreactor. This bioreactor yields 151/hr biogas from every liter of anaerobic sludge, {{making it one of}} the best performing bioreactors in the world. Due to these and other achievements, FCU was chosen as the site for the APEC Research Center for Advanced <b>Biohydrogen</b> Technology, which was established in cooperation with APEC and the National Science Council. In addition, the Taiwan branch of the International Association for Hydrogen Energy (IAHE) has been established on the FCU campus. In 2011, FCU completed the world’s first Bio-H2 gas station. The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Research Center has twice been honored by the US-based Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) with a Special Achievement in GIS award. In 2010, this research center was invited to join the European Union’s Plan4All project; among its 25 collaborative partners, FCU was the only academic organization from Taiwan. In that same year, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) approved the GIS Research Center as its first software standards compliance testing center in Asia.

Microalgae are of significant use in healthcare.Chlorellin from the green microalga Chlorellais an effective antibiotic against Gram +ve and -vc bacteria. Algae are an excellent feed stock for green fuel as they are used for the production of biodiesel, bioethanol, biogasoline, biomethanol, biobutanol and recently <b>biohydrogen.</b> The full genome sequences of many species of cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae have been used for evolutionary studies and the identification and comparison of the genes coding for specific proteins. Collections of cDNAs and ETs also aid in genomic research by providing fast and inexpensive ways to discover new genes and their functions and map their positions on chromosomes. Many species of diatoms are used for synthesizing nanoparticles and are being explored for their use as drug delivery systems.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Biohydrogen</b> {{is being}} {{investigated}} as a clean and renewable energy source. Two main enzymes produce hydrogen in microbes, hydrogenase and nitrogenase; Cyanothece has both enzymes. [...] The nitrogenase fixes nitrogen, releasing hydrogen as a byproduct. The two different hydrogenase enzymes are an uptake hydrogenase associated with the nitrogenase and a bidirectional hydrogenase. When cultures are entrained in light-dark cycles, the nitrogenase and uptake hydrogenase are both active during the “night”, with many copies per cell. [...] Western blots show only a few copies of the bidirectional hydrogenase occur at any time. About 300 μmol H2/(mg Chl h) was produced by sp. ATCC 51142 from cultures that were grown in continuous light at 30 μmol photons/(m2s), anaerobic conditions, 50 mM glycerol, and without any nitrate (so the nitrogenase was active). [...] Glycerol in the growth medium reduces the need for carbon fixation, leaving more energy for nitrogen fixation and hydrogen production. [...] It was shown by acetylene reduction that hydrogen generation and nitrogen fixation were directly proportional. [...] A parallel study has demonstrated concomitant and uninterrupted production of both H2 and O2 in continuously illuminated photobioreactor cultures, upon nitrogen-deprivation of ammonium-limited chemostat growth. Further work on improving the supply of protons and electrons to nitrogenase, as well as protecting it from oxygen could stimulate even better rates.|$|E

This strain produced a <b>biohydrogen</b> yield of 1. 90 mol H 2 /mol glucose with productivity of 170 mL/L/h using pure glucose as substrate. The highest cumulative <b>biohydrogen</b> collected after 24 h of fermentation was 2468 mL/L-medium. <b>Biohydrogen</b> fermentation using sago hampas hydrolysate produced higher <b>biohydrogen</b> yield (2. 65 mol H 2 /mol glucose) than sago pith residue (SPR) hydrolysate that produced 2. 23 mol H 2 /mol glucose. A higher <b>biohydrogen</b> productivity of 1757 mL/L/h was obtained when using sago hampas hydrolysate compared to when using pure glucose that has the productivity of 170 mL/L/h. A comparable <b>biohydrogen</b> production was also obtained by C. butyricum A 1 when compared to C. butyricum EB 6 that produced a <b>biohydrogen</b> yield of 2. 50 mol H 2 /mol glucose using sago hampas hydrolysate as substrate.
