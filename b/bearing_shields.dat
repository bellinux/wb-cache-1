25|$|The Palm House (1844–1848) was {{the result}} of {{cooperation}} between architect Decimus Burton and iron founder Richard Turner, and continues upon the glass house design principles developed by John Claudius Loudon and Joseph Paxton. A space frame of wrought iron arches, held together by horizontal tubular structures containing long prestressed cables, supports glass panes which were originally tinted green with copper oxide to reduce the significant heating effect. The 19m high central nave is surrounded by a walkway at 9m height, allowing visitors a closer look upon the palm tree crowns. In front of the Palm House on the east side are the Queen's Beasts, ten statues of animals <b>bearing</b> <b>shields.</b> They are Portland stone replicas of originals done by James Woodford and were placed here in 1958.|$|E
25|$|Lord Astor also {{commissioned}} a triptych altarpiece {{for the family}} chapel within the Octagon Temple at Cliveden. This was executed in the late 1890s. Frank Pearson was the supervising architect and Hitch carried out the carving. The whole altarpiece is uniformly gilded, with cabuchons of semi-precious stones in the frames. The subject is the Adoration and the two wings of the triptych feature more attendant merchants or possibly shepherds. The central panel is topped by carved angels and a central finial representing the Lamb, all gilded. The altarpiece is set on a base with three more reliefs of angels <b>bearing</b> <b>shields</b> of arms: a double panel flanked by single outer panels. The creation of the chapel and the conversion it involved of Leoni's Octagon Temple of 1735, {{may be attributed to}} the death in 1894 of Astor’s wife Mary, only a year after his purchase of the estate. The chapel is in the lower room with the floor removed above to create a small domed octagonal chapel. The first, second and third Viscounts Astor are buried there, with red marble commemorative slabs in the floor which is of Opus Alexandrinum.|$|E
2500|$|This window {{displays}} four allegories: Victory, {{as a woman}} {{holding a}} crown and surrounded by a laurel branch and a helmet on a shield; Labour, a male figure amongst objects such as a shovel, spinning wheel, and astrolabe, with the motto Fortitudo Industria et Pax (Strength Industry and Peace); Progress, a man holding a book and quill, surrounded by a celestial crown, weighing scales, hourglass, and galley; and Science, a male holding a microscope and flask, amongst symbols such as a globe and torch, all below a ribbon indicating metallurgy, mineralogy, and chemistry. These four figures are arranged above four lower panels, the first showing three inscriptions: THANKS BE TO GOD WHO GIVETH US THE VICTORY, from 1 Corinthians 15:57, FAITH UNTO DEATH, and ACQUIT YE LIKE MEN BE STRONG, both from 1 Corinthians 16:13. Also in this section is {{a crowd of people}} <b>bearing</b> <b>shields</b> and spears, who represent the people of Canada uniting in response to the call of the man shown in the second panel, who holds a sword and trumpet, calling [...] "To Arms"; at his side is a child holding flowers, representing faith and courage. This section also displays the words THOU HAST GIRDED ME WITH STRENGTH UNTO THE BATTLE, from Psalm 18:39. In the third panel stands a woman supporting a rod entwined with winged serpents, the Rod of Asclepius, characterising the nurses of battle, and below her is the phrase TRUE WORTH THAT NEVER KNOWS IGNOBLE DEFEAT SHINES WITH UNDIMMED GLORY, taken from Horace's Odes. The fourth bay displays a group of men and horses congregating from farms, offices, and factories, while a fleet of ships rests at bay awaiting the men to carry them to war.|$|E

25|$|Mars Cocidius {{is found}} in five {{inscriptions}} from northern England. About twenty dedications in all are known for the Celtic god Cocidius, mainly made by Roman military personnel, and confined to northwest Cumbria and along Hadrian's Wall. He is once identified with Silvanus. He is depicted on two votive plaques as a warrior <b>bearing</b> <b>shield</b> and spear, and on an altar as a huntsman accompanied by a dog and stag.|$|R
60|$|On the {{particular}} day of Owen's arrival it {{was crowded with}} regiments, twelve of them, all dressed in their different uniforms and <b>bearing</b> <b>shields</b> to match, not {{one of which was}} less than 2500 strong. At this moment the regiments were massed in deep lines, each battalion by itself, {{on either side of the}} broad roadway that ran straight up the kraal to where the king, his sons, his advisers and guards, together with the company of wizards, were placed in front of the royal house.|$|E
60|$|He {{had become}} Chancellor, when the King thought of making him Archbishop. He was clever, gay, well educated, brave; {{had fought in}} several battles in France; had {{defeated}} a French knight in single combat, and brought his horse away as a token of the victory. He lived in a noble palace, he was the tutor of the young Prince Henry, he was served by one hundred and forty knights, his riches were immense. The King once sent him as his ambassador to France; and the French people, beholding in what state he travelled, cried out in the streets, 'How splendid must the King of England be, when {{this is only the}} Chancellor!' They had good reason to wonder at the magnificence of Thomas a Becket, for, when he entered a French town, his procession was headed by two hundred and fifty singing boys; then, came his hounds in couples; then, eight waggons, each drawn by five horses driven by five drivers: two of the waggons filled with strong ale to be given away to the people; four, with his gold and silver plate and stately clothes; two, with the dresses of his numerous servants. Then, came twelve horses, each with a monkey on his back; then, a train of people <b>bearing</b> <b>shields</b> and leading fine war-horses splendidly equipped; then, falconers with hawks upon their wrists; then, a host of knights, and gentlemen and priests; then, the Chancellor with his brilliant garments flashing in the sun, and all the people capering and shouting with delight.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bearing</b> <b>shields</b> {{reduce the}} entry of dirt into the bearing. Metal and rubber {{non-contact}} shields are commonly used, of which rubber shields are slightly more effective. Neither shield type is totally effective, often resulting in the need for bearing maintenance.The ball retainer is usually made of either metal, plastic, or glass. Plastic types are preferred since they are quieter.|$|E
5000|$|An industrious {{but poor}} cobbler tried to fish {{until he was}} so hungry {{that he thought he}} would hang himself if he caught nothing. He caught a {{beautiful}} fish. It told him to cook it and then give two pieces to his wife, and bury two more in the garden. He did this. His wife gave birth to twin boys, and two plants sprang up, <b>bearing</b> <b>shields,</b> in the garden.|$|E
50|$|The former Crawford and Co Building {{possesses}} a facade design that, in its individual elements and their composition, is uncommon {{and has always}} been uncommon. The use of skyline decoration - emu and kangaroo statues <b>bearing</b> <b>shields,</b> picks and shovels; an ornamental central pediment featuring lion's heads, acanthus leaves and egg; and dart mouldings upon a balustraded parapet - plus dissimilar and abundant enrichment to each storey including moulded faces on the keystones of the entrance and ground floor window arches is an idiosyncratic stylist combination.|$|E

5000|$|A free-standing, {{carved wooden}} screen made of bog oak in the Great Hall {{probably}} dates from between 1530 and 1540. It {{is described by}} Pevsner as being [...] "of an exuberance of decoration matched nowhere else in England" [...] {{and is the only}} known surviving example from {{the first half of the}} 16th century. It stands at the north end of the great hall, covering the entrance to the original kitchens. It has three spiral finials, two outer ones carved from single lengths of timber at the sides of the screen framing eight traceried panels. On the top-rail are two angels, a male and female <b>bearing</b> <b>shields</b> with the arms of Fitton and Banastre families. Two horizontal rails are morticed into the uprights. Three errors were possibly incorporated by its makers to avoid a charge of heresy, as a contemporary belief was that God alone could create perfection. One panel on the hall side is upside down, on the opposite side one panel has a different pattern and an angel has an extra finger.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} at the riverside, next to a quay at the limit of {{navigation}} of the River Fowey. It is probably {{on the site of}} the 7th century oratory of St Winnoc. A stone church was built in the 12th century, probably cruciform in plan, and there are traces of the Norman stonework on the north side. The transept arch was reconstructed in the 13th century. About 1465 the south wall was demolished and the south aisle, arcade and roofs built. The chancel was restored by J. H. Seddon in the 19th century, retaining the 16th century east window. The west tower is of standard Cornish Perpendicular style. There is stained glass of c. 1500 in the east windows of the chancel and S aisle. The 16th century rood screen, carved with leaves and flowers, was restored by Violet Pinwell in 1907 (by Edmund H. Sedding according to Pevsner). The loft, rood and some of the south aisle screen were newly made in the restoration. The granite font, carved with angels <b>bearing</b> <b>shields,</b> is 14th century. The pulpit is of c.1600 and richly carved. There are also carved bench ends of various dates from 1485 to 1630. The monuments include one in slate to William Sawle, d. 1651.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, {{the outer}} {{square of the}} palace is {{assaulted}} by 10,000 soldiers wearing golden armor and golden flower sigils, with Prince Jai in the lead. They overpower the assassins and proceed to the inner square of the palace, trampling upon the bed of golden flowers arranged for the ceremony. However, thousands of silver armoed soldiers appear, being the reserve army of the Emperor, <b>bearing</b> <b>shields,</b> pikes, and bow-and-arrows, and they slaughter the golden soldiers {{down to the last}} man. Prince Jai rises from the sea of bodies and is taken captive. Behind him, the courtyard is cleaned with mechanical efficiency by a legion of servants, with bodies being removed, floors being scrubbed and laid with carpets, and pots of yellow flowers being replaced, making it seem as if the entire rebellion never happened. At midnight, the Double Ninth Festival begins as scheduled. At the table, the Emperor expresses disappointment with Prince Jai, saying that he was already planning to give Prince Jai the throne. He offers to pardon Prince Jai if the latter cooperates with the Empress's poisoning. Prince Jai refuses and kills himself. Another cup of poisoned tea is brought to the Empress, but she slaps it away, and the liquid is shown to corrode the table's wood, along with the golden flower image engraved into the wood.|$|E
