5|$|FES is {{the oldest}} variant of Guinness that is still available, {{although}} its ingredients and production methods have varied over time. In 1824, it had an original gravity (OG) of 1082. After a peak in strength in 1840, when the beer had an OG of 1098, by 1860, the beer was reduced to its current standard strength of around 1075 OG. FES was originally brewed with pale and brown malts. <b>Black</b> <b>malt</b> was used from 1819, and by 1828 its use had entirely replaced brown malt. In 1883, the beer was produced with 85 per cent pale malt, 10 per cent amber malt and 5 per cent roasted malt. From 1929 – 1930 onwards, Guinness switched from using roasted malt in the beer's production to roasted barley. Amber malt continued {{to be added to}} the grist until 1940. Flaked barley was introduced in the early 1950s, and the hopping rate was decreased.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Black</b> <b>malt,</b> {{also called}} patent malt or black patent malt, is barley malt {{that has been}} kilned {{to the point of}} carbonizing, around 200 °C. The term [...] "patent malt" [...] comes from its {{invention}} in England in 1817, late enough that the inventor of the process for its manufacture, Daniel Wheeler, was awarded a patent. <b>Black</b> <b>malt</b> provides the color and some of the flavor in black porter, contributing an acrid, ashy undertone to the taste. In small quantities, <b>black</b> <b>malt</b> {{can also be used to}} darken beer to a desired color, sometimes as a substitute for caramel color. Due to its high kilning temperature, it contains no enzymes. ASBC 500-600/EBC >1300.|$|E

5000|$|Tooheys Old {{is a dark}} ale type of beer {{produced}} in Australia by Tooheys. It has been brewed since 1869 and Tooheys began bottling it in 1970. It has 4.41% alcohol per volume while only containing 132 calories. It is on tap in many bars in New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and Queensland. It is made with top fermentation ale yeast, lightly hopped with <b>black</b> <b>malt</b> giving it a very dark, almost blackish, colour.|$|E
50|$|This kind of beer {{was usually}} made with barley, {{approximately}} 25 to 30 percent corn, and 1 to 2 percent each caramel and <b>black</b> <b>malt</b> {{to give it}} a dark color. It had an original gravity of 1.040-1.050, an average bitterness of 27 IBU. The beer was typically kegged and served relatively young, with a short time of 6 to 8 days from mash in to keg. The beer is an easy-drinking, slightly sweet, dark amber to light brown ale.|$|E
50|$|Mild ales are {{generally}} based on mild malt or pale malt. Most milds contain, in addition, {{a quantity of}} crystal malt; dark milds, meanwhile, make use of chocolate malt, <b>black</b> <b>malt</b> or dark brewing sugars. Milds tend to be lightly hopped compared to pale ale and are usually low in alcohol; strong mild ales used to reach six or seven per cent abv, but very few such beers are still brewed. Sarah Hughes Dark Ruby Mild, brewed to a pre-World War I recipe, is a rare example of a strong Mild (6.0% ABV).|$|E

2500|$|Malting is {{the process}} of {{converting}} barley or other cereal grains into malt, for use in brewing, distilling, or in foods and takes place in a maltings, sometimes called a malthouse, or a malting floor. The cereal is spread out on the malting floor in a layer of 8 to 12cm (3 to 5 inch) depth. The malting process starts with drying the grains to a moisture content below 14%, and then storing for around six weeks to overcome seed dormancy. When ready, the grain is immersed or steeped in water two or three times over two or three days to allow the grain to absorb moisture and to start to sprout. When the grain has a moisture content of around 46%, it is transferred to the malting or germination floor, where it is constantly turned over for around five days while it is air-dried [...] The grain at this point is called [...] "green malt". The green malt is then dried and pre-toasted in an oven (or kiln) to the desired colour and specification. Malts range in colour from very pale through crystal and amber to chocolate or <b>black</b> <b>malts.</b>|$|R
40|$|Phenol-specific {{extracts}} of 12 Belgian special beers {{were analyzed}} by gas chromatography hyphenated to olfactometry (AEDA procedure) and mass spectrometry (single ion monitoring mode). As guaiacol and 4 -methylphenol were revealed to be more concentrated in brown beers (> 3. 5 and > 1. 1 μg/L, respectively), they are proposed as specific markers of the utilization of dark malts. Analysis of five differently colored malts (5, 50, 500, 900, and 1500 °EBC) allowed confirmation of high levels of guaiacol (> 180 μg/L; values given in wort, for 100 % specialty malt) and 4 -methylphenol (> 7 μg/L) for chocolate and <b>black</b> <b>malts</b> only (versus respectively < 3 μg/L and undetected in all other worts). Monitoring of beer aging highlighted major differences between phenols. Guaiacol and 4 -methylphenol appeared even more concentrated in dark beers after 14 months of aging, reaching levels not far from their sensory thresholds. 4 -Vinylphenols and 4 -ethylphenols, on the contrary, proved to be gradually degraded in POF(+) -yeast-derived beers. Vanillin exhibited an interesting pattern: in beers initially containing < 25 μg/L, the vanillin concentration increased over a 14 month aging period to levels exceeding its sensory threshold (up to 160 μg/L). Beers initially showing an above-threshold level of vanillin displayed a decrease during aging...|$|R
50|$|In brewing, {{the color}} of a grain or product is {{evaluated}} by the Standard Reference Method (SRM), Lovibond (°L), American Society of Brewing Chemists (ASBC) or European Brewery Convention (EBC) standards. While SRM and ASBC originate in North America and EBC in Europe, all three systems can be found in use throughout the world; degrees Lovibond has fallen out of industry use but has remained in use in homebrewing circles as the easiest to implement without a spectrophotometer. The darkness of grains range from as light as less than 2 SRM/4 EBC for Pilsener malt to as dark as 700 SRM/1600 EBC for <b>black</b> <b>malt</b> and roasted barley.|$|E

5000|$|Porter {{originated}} in London, England {{in the early}} 1720s. The style quickly became popular in the City especially with porters (hence its name): it had a strong flavour, took longer to spoil than other beers, increased in alcohol content with age, was significantly cheaper than other beers, and was not easily affected by heat. Within a few decades, porter breweries in London had grown [...] "beyond any previously known scale". Large volumes were exported to Ireland, where by 1776 it was being brewed by Arthur Guinness at his St. James's Gate Brewery.

After spending {{most of his life}} in a nomadic existence [...] "up and down the dial", WKRP settles Johnny down and establishes a relatively stable ensemble of friends and associates for him. Although the tradeoff is a cramped apartment and low pay, this arrangement doesn't seem to overly concern him much (at one point he describes himself as [...] "a 40-year-old man who lives like a college student"). He is also believed to have been incarcerated at least twice; once in Mexico, where he says he was involved in a [...] "minor misunderstanding with 145 Mexican cops," [...] and another time in New Jersey when he indicated that he, [...] "Went through Princeton....It was in a car....A police car actually! Very, very educational." [...] He was a hippie in the 1960s, 10-12 years before the show's time frame. It is implied that he smokes marijuana by his overall character, and occasional references to drug culture (e.g. Mr. Carlson once dismissed a business as a front for selling drug paraphernalia, and Johnny immediately asked where it was). In the first season episode, [...] "Fish Story", he shows a near superhuman resistance to the effects of alcohol, apparently building up a high tolerance after years of heavy drinking. He is often seen wearing a <b>Black</b> Death <b>Malt</b> Liquor T-shirt, designed by Rip Off Press underground comic artist Dave Sheridan.|$|R
50|$|The large London porter breweries pioneered many {{technological}} advances, {{such as the}} use of {{the thermometer}} (about 1760) and the hydrometer (1770). The use of the latter transformed the nature of porter. The first porters were brewed from 100% brown malt. Now brewers were able to accurately measure the yield of the malt they used, and noticed that brown malt, though cheaper than pale malt, only produced about two thirds as much fermentable material. When the malt tax was increased to help pay for the Napoleonic War, brewers had an incentive to use less malt. Their solution was to use a proportion of pale malt and add colouring to obtain the expected hue. When a law was passed in 1816 allowing only malt and hops to be used in the production of beer (a sort of British Reinheitsgebot), they were left in a quandary. Their problem was solved by Wheeler's invention of the almost <b>black</b> (kilned) patent <b>malt</b> in 1817. It was now possible to brew porter from 95% pale malt and 5% patent malt, though most London brewers continued to use some brown malt for flavour.|$|R
40|$|Although {{there are}} product-to-product differences, the {{majority}} of the crystal and caramel malts tested have been shown to have a net destabilizing impact on foam. A foaming test using a model beer has been developed to quantify the magnitude of this inhibitory effect. Lipid analysis using thin-layer chromatography reveals that there are elevated levels of triglycerides in problematic malts. There also appear to be oxidized lipids in the specialty malts, probably produced in the heating stage of malt production with higher levels in more intensely heated products. However some specialty malts, such as <b>black</b> <b>malt,</b> while containing such foam-negative entities, do display superior foaming properties, probably because they develop even more powerful foam-positive components in the severe heating events. © 2014 The Institute of Brewing & Distilling...|$|E

40|$|To produce {{specialty}} malt, malts were roasted by combined microwave-hot air {{at various}} specific microwave powers (SP = 2. 5 to 3 W/g), microwave heating times (tmw = 3. 3 to 3. 5 min), oven temperatures (Toven = 180 to 220 °C), and oven heating times (toven = 60 to 150 min). The response variables, color, energy consumption by microwave (Emw) and oven (Eoven), total energy consumption (Etot), quantity of neo-formed contaminants (NFCs), which include hydroxymethylfurfural, furfural, furan, and acrylamide were determined. Response surface methodology (RSM) {{was performed to}} analyze and predict the optimum conditions for the specialty malt. Production using combined microwave-hot air roasting process based on minimum energy consumption and level of NFCs. At 95 % confident level, SP, Toven, and toven were the most influencing effects with regard to Etot, whereas tmw did not affect Etot. Toven and toven significantly affected malt color. Only Toven significantly influenced the NFCs content. The optimum parameters were: SP = 2. 68 W/g for 3. 44 min, Toven = 206 °C for 136 min for coffee malt, SP = 2. 5 W/g for 3. 48 min, Toven = 214 °C for 136 min for chocolate malt, and SP = 2. 5 W/g for 3. 48 min, Toven = 211 °C for 150 min for <b>black</b> <b>malt.</b> Comparing with conventional process, combined microwave-hot air reduced Etot by approximately 40 %, 26 %, and 26 % for coffee, chocolate, and black malts, respectively, and reduced HMF, furfural, furan, and acrylamide contents by 40 %, 18 %, 23 %, and 95 %, respectively, for <b>black</b> <b>malt.</b> Practical Application: An important goal for research institutions and the brewery industry is to produce colored malt by combining microwave and hot air roasting, while saving energy, getting desirable color, and avoiding the formation of carcinogenic and toxic neo-formed contaminants (NFCs). Therefore, one objective {{of this study was}} to compare energy consumption and content of NFCs during roasting of malt by hot air-only and combined microwave-hot air processes as well as to determine the effect of specific power, microwave processing time, oven temperature, and oven processing time during combined microwave-hot air roasting. Another objective was to predict the optimum conditions for the production of coffee, chocolate, and black malts. © 2010 Institute of Food Technologists®. financial support from Natl.

40|$|Guignardia citricarpa, {{the causal}} agent of Citrus Black Spot, {{is subject to}} {{phytosanitary}} legislation in the European Union and the U. S. A. This species is frequently confused with G. mangiferae, which is a non-pathogenic, and is commonly isolated as an endophyte from citrus fruits and {{a wide range of}} other hosts. Recently, necrotic spots similar to those caused by G. citricarpa were observed on fruit of Citrus maxima intercepted in consignments exported from Asia. In these spots, pycnidia and conidia of a Guignardia species closely resembling G. citricarpa were observed, and therefore measures were taken for the consignments in line with the European Union legislation for G. citricarpa. To determine the identity of the causal organism on this new host, fungal isolates were subjected to DNA sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS 1, 5. 8 S, ITS 2), translation elongation factor 1 -alpha (TEF 1) and actin genes. A combined phylogenetic tree resolved three species correlating to G. citricarpa, G. mangiferae and a previously undescribed species, Phyllosticta citriasiana sp. nov., closely related to G. citricarpa. Morphologically P. citriasiana can be distinguished from G. citricarpa by having larger conidia, longer conidial appendages, and in not producing any diffuse yellow pigment when cultivated on oatmeal agar (OA). Furthermore, it is distinguishable from G. mangiferae by having smaller conidia, with a narrower mucoid sheath. In culture, colonies of P. citriasiana can also be distinguished from G. citricarpa and G. mangiferae by being darker shades of grey and <b>black</b> on OA, <b>malt</b> extract agar (MEA), potato-dextrose agar, and cornmeal agar. Furthermore, cultures of P. citriasiana achieved optimal growth after 2 weeks at 21 - 27 °C, and ceased to grow at 30 - 33 °C. In contrast, colonies of G. citricarpa and G. mangiferae achieved optimal growth at 27 - 30 °C, and ceased to grow at 30 - 36 °C Colonies of P. citriasiana also grew faster than those of G. citricarpa and G. mangiferae on OA and MEA.
