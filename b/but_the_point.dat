25|$|Examples of {{infidelity}} are found acted out in television and film {{because of the}} drama often. In {{the beginning of the}} popular series Grey’s Anatomy, one of TV’s most beloved couples, Derek and Meredith, began their relationship while Derek was married to Addison. Although, Derek and Meredith went on to have a strong relationship, Addison changed. She never married again, or even held a serious relationship for long, during her time on the series and let her bitterness for Derek’s unfaithfulness be known. Another example is the film The Other Women. It is based off the unfaithfulness of one man to three different women. When the wife finds out about the affair she has a breakdown. She cries, she becomes helpless without the support of others and she drinks in attempts {{to come to grips with}} the infidelity. There are many more examples {{of infidelity}} in films and television, and real life, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> is: if your partner cheats on you it is impossible to be completely unbothered.|$|E

500|$|Because {{of these}} influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's {{personal}} style, the media often defined her as punk, something she denied being.

Lavigne also commented on the matter: [...] "I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [...] rebel... punk, and I am so not any of them." [...] Although she stated to have punk influences on her music: [...] "I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music.

500|$|As a result, the Tri-Cities Blackhawks drafted Cousy, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> {{guard was}} unenthusiastic {{about his new}} employer.

As compensation for having to give up his driving school, Cousy demanded a salary of $10,000 from Blackhawks owner Ben Kerner. When Kerner only offered him $6,000, Cousy refused to report. Cousy was then picked up by the Chicago Stags, but when they folded, league Commissioner Maurice Podoloff declared three Stags available for a dispersal draft: team scoring leaderMax Zaslofsky, Andy Phillip and Cousy. Celtics owner Walter A. Brown was one of the three club bosses invited. He later made it clear that he was hoping for Zaslofsky, would have tolerated Phillip, and did not want Cousy. When the Celtics drew Cousy, Brown confessed: [...] "I could have fallen to the floor." [...] Brown reluctantly gave him a $9,000 salary.|$|E
500|$|... "Acrobat" [...] {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{personal}} songs on Achtung Baby with Bono acknowledging personal weakness, contradictions, and inadequacy. The Edge noted that the song contained [...] "a bit of venom", likening it to [...] "the bitter, John Lennon tradition of 'Working Class Hero', slightly snarling and cynical." [...] Bono stated [...] "as we moved from the eighties to the nineties, I stopped throwing rocks at the obvious symbols of power and the abuse of it. I started throwing rocks at my own hypocrisy... 'Acrobat' [...] 'Don't believe what you hear, don't believe what you see / If you just close your eyes / You can feel the enemy...' I can't remember it, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> is: you start to see the world in a different way, and you're part of the problem, not just part of the solution". In 2006, he noted it was [...] "a song about being a hypocrite, and I think we all can be and I certainly have been. And you know, you exact very high standards on people in the world but then you don't live them personally", noting the theme was most evident in the lyric [...] "I must be an acrobat to talk like this and act like that". Hot Press editor Niall Stokes felt The Edge's guitar playing combined elements of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] with [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky". Speaking of its theme he said [...] "at its heart is an awareness of the ravages of time, and what it does to people and to relationships. But beyond that, there is the self-awareness that, itself, comes only with experience... Bono acknowledges his own weakness and inadequacy. He is more conscious now than ever before of the contradictions in his own position."

[...] Variety Weekly called it [...] "an out-and-out box office flop" [...] only six days after its premiere and claimed that the film had taken two years to shoot, cost $700,000 and was originally 130 reels long. The review went on to say that [...] "nothing more morbid and senseless, from a commercial picture standpoint, has been seen on the screen for a long, long time" [...] and that despite its [...] "excellent acting, fine direction and the undoubted power of its story... it does not entertain." [...] In its December 1924 – January 1925 issue, Exceptional Photoplays called it [...] "one of the most uncompromising films ever shown on the screen. There have already been many criticisms of its brutality, its stark realism, its sordidness. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> is that it was never intended to be a pleasant picture." [...] In the February 1925 issue of Theatre Magazine, Aileen St. John-Brenon wrote that [...] "the persons in the photoplay are not characters, but types—they are well selected, weighed and completely drilled. But they did not act; they do not come to life. They perform their mission like so many uncouth images of miserliness and repugnant animalism." [...] Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times gave the film a mostly positive review in regards to the acting and directing while criticizing how it was edited, writing that MGM [...] "clipped this production as much as they dared... and are to be congratulated on their efforts and the only pity is that they did not use the scissors more generously in the beginning." [...] In a Life Magazine article, Robert E. Sherwood also defended MGM's cutting of the film and called von Stroheim [...] "a genius... badly in need of a stopwatch." [...] Iris Barry of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) disliked the tinting, saying [...] "a not very pleasing yellow tinge is smudged in."
