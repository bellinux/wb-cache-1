25|$|Australia also {{produces}} considerable amounts of cotton. The {{majority of the}} cotton produced is genetically modified to be resistant to the herbicide glyphosate or to actively kill pests through the production of <b>Bt</b> <b>toxin</b> (Bt-cotton).

25|$|Genetically {{modified}} (GM) cotton {{was developed}} to reduce the heavy reliance on pesticides. The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) naturally produces a chemical harmful only to {{a small fraction of}} insects, most notably the larvae of moths and butterflies, beetles, and flies, and harmless to other forms of life. The gene coding for <b>Bt</b> <b>toxin</b> has been inserted into cotton, causing cotton, called Bt cotton, to produce this natural insecticide in its tissues. In many regions, the main pests in commercial cotton are lepidopteran larvae, which are killed by the Bt protein in the transgenic cotton they eat. This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad-spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests (some of which have developed pyrethroid resistance). This spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology and further contributes to noninsecticide pest management.|$|E
2500|$|This {{study should}} be {{interpreted}} with caution given that [...] no repetition of the experiment nor any attempt to find confounding factors was made. In addition, <b>Bt</b> <b>toxin</b> and transgenic Bt pollen showed no acute toxicity to any of the life stages of the bees examined, even when the <b>Bt</b> <b>toxin</b> was fed at concentrations 100 times that found in transgenic Bt pollen from maize.|$|E
30|$|Despite the {{assumption}} that <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> are highly specific, many of these toxins actually show cross-order activity [14],[15]. Several <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> {{have been reported to}} affect non-target taxa [16]-[21], especially non-target Lepidoptera [22]-[28].|$|R
50|$|Concerns over {{possible}} {{environmental impact}} from accumulation of <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> from plant tissues, pollen dispersal, and direct secretion from roots have been investigated. <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> may persist in soil for over 200 days, with half-lives between 1.6 and 22 days. Much of the toxin is initially degraded rapidly by microorganisms in the environment, while some is adsorbed by organic matter and persists longer. Some studies, in contrast, {{claim that the}} toxins do not persist in the soil. <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> {{are less likely to}} accumulate in bodies of water, but pollen shed or soil runoff may deposit them in an aquatic ecosystem. Fish species are not susceptible to <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> if exposed.|$|R
30|$|Varieties of Bt {{corn and}} Bt cotton {{registered}} in the USA were producing 18 different combinations of 11 <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins.</b> Each variety produces 1 – 6 <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> that kill caterpillars, beetles, or both (Tabashnik et al. 2009).|$|R
2500|$|Complicating {{factors can}} affect {{the success of the}} high-dose/refuge strategy. For example, if the {{temperature}} is not ideal, thermal stress can lower <b>Bt</b> <b>toxin</b> production and leave the plant more susceptible. More importantly, reduced late-season expression has been documented, possibly resulting from DNA methylation of the promoter. [...] The success of the high-dose/refuge strategy has successfully maintained the value of Bt crops. This success has depended on factors independent of management strategy, including low initial resistance allele frequencies, fitness costs associated with resistance, and the abundance of non-Bt host plants outside the refuges.|$|E
50|$|The diamondback moth was {{the first}} insect found to have become {{resistant}} to biological control by the <b>Bt</b> <b>toxin</b> (from Bacillus thuringiensis) in the field.

50|$|Bacillus thuringiensis, a {{bacterial}} disease of Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Diptera, {{is a well-known}} insecticide example. The toxin from B. thuringiensis (<b>Bt</b> <b>toxin)</b> has been incorporated directly into plants {{through the use of}} genetic engineering. The use of <b>Bt</b> <b>Toxin</b> is particularly controversial. Its manufacturers claim it has little effect on other organisms, and is more environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides. However, at least one scientific study has suggested that it may lead to slight histopathological changes on the liver and kidneys of mammals with <b>Bt</b> <b>toxin</b> in their diet.|$|E
40|$|Transgenic crops expressing toxin {{proteins}} from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) {{have been}} deployed {{on a large scale}} for management of Helicoverpa armigera. Resistance to <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> has been documented in several papers, and therefore, we examined the role of midgut microflora of H. armigera in its susceptibility to <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> [...] . ...|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to native <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins,</b> {{there are several}} reasons to assess in more detail the potential toxicity of <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> expressed in genetically engineered plants: It is known that there are several differences {{in the structure of the}} Cry toxin expressed in the genetically engineered plants and those used in traditional mixtures [5, 6]. Traditionally, the Bt protoxin has been used for spraying as protoxin and in crystallised (inactivated) form. However, the Cry toxins expressed in the genetically engineered plants are already solubilised and activated. It is known that changes in the structure of the protein can have considerable influence on the toxicity of the Bt proteins [7]. Therefore, the risk assessment taken from traditional <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> used in biological pest control can only be applied to a limited extent to the <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> expressed in plants.|$|R

50|$|During 2009 and 2010, some Iowa fields showed severe {{injury to}} corn {{producing}} <b>Bt</b> <b>toxin</b> Cry3Bb1 by {{western corn rootworm}}. During 2011, mCry3A corn also displayed insect damage, including cross-resistance between these toxins. Resistance persisted and spread in Iowa. Bt corn that targets western corn rootworm does not produce a high dose of <b>Bt</b> <b>toxin,</b> and displays less resistance than that seen in a high-dose Bt crop.|$|E

50|$|In 1995, Monsanto {{introduced}} the NewLeaf variety of potato which {{was their first}} genetically modified crop. It was designed to resist attack from the Colorado potato beetle due to the insertion of <b>Bt</b> <b>toxin</b> producing genes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. The insect-resistant potatoes found only a small market, and Monsanto discontinued the sale of seed in 2001.|$|E
30|$|Despite our {{confidence}} in the material used previously, we accounted for this issue in our new studies by using <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> from another source. These toxins were produced by Dr. Marianne Pusztai-Carey, Case Western University, Cleveland, Ohio, {{one of the most}} experienced, widely respected and routined producer of <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> used by a large community of scientists researching on particular issues of resistance evolution to these <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> in target pests (e.g., [11 – 13]).

30|$|It {{has to be}} {{stressed}} that these questions not only concern genetically engineered soybeans that express <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins.</b> And in assessing these questions, {{it should also be}} taken into account that <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> from other transgenic plants, such as stacked maize, can be mixed with the soybeans in the diet and enhance immune system reactions based on the identified mechanisms.|$|R
40|$|To control {{some key}} insect pests, corn has been genetically {{modified}} to produce insecticidal proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt).

50|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the fate of Bt toxins that are ingested in foods. <b>Bt</b> <b>toxin</b> proteins {{have been shown to}} digest within minutes of exposure to simulated gastric fluids. The instability of the proteins in digestive fluids is an additional indication that Cry proteins are unlikely to be allergenic, since most known food allergens resist degradation and are ultimately absorbed in the small intestine.|$|E
50|$|Monsanto invented {{and sells}} genetically {{modified}} seeds {{that make a}} crystalline insecticidal protein from Bacillus thuringiensis, known as Bt. In 1995 Monsanto's potato plants producing <b>Bt</b> <b>toxin</b> were approved by the Environmental Protection Agency, following approval by the FDA, making it the first pesticide-producing crop to be approved in the United States. Monsanto subsequently developed Bt maize (MON 802, MON 809, MON 863, MON 810), Bt soybean and Bt cotton.|$|E
30|$|Multiple {{challenges}} or stressors continuously affecting organisms can {{be regarded}} as the normal real-life situation in the field as well as in regard to consumption of food and feed. Additive or synergistic effects of <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> in combination with other stressors are also relevant for the health risk assessment of Intacta soybeans. Although empirical data on mammals are mostly lacking, the data that are available can be used to derive robust hypotheses for further investigation of health risks: Combinatorial effects are known to enhance the toxicity of <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> in invertebrates and have been observed in experiments with pyrethroids [23], azadirachtin, [24], avidin [25], bacteria [14], nosema [26] and other <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> [27, 28]. Since the stacked Intacta soybeans and food and feed derived thereof are likely to contain residues from spraying with glyphosate formulations, the possible interaction between <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> and co-stressors, such as pesticides, are relevant to the health risk assessment.|$|R
30|$|In {{assessing}} these questions, {{it should}} also be taken into account that <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> from other transgenic plants, such as stacked maize, can be mixed with the soybeans in the diet and thereby enhance immune system responses based on the mechanisms identified, even if the soybeans do not express <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> themselves. For example, genetically engineered plants, such as the genetically engineered maize ‘Smartstax’ (MON 89034  ×  1507  × MON 88017  ×  59122), express up to six <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins,</b> resulting in a much higher concentration of the potentially immunogenic proteins. We are not aware of studies that have investigated the impact on the immune system of consuming food or feed derived from these plants alone or in combination with soybeans.|$|R
40|$|Genes {{encoding}} cry 1 Ab and cry 1 Ac δ-endotoxins {{from the}} bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) {{that have been}} incorporated in several crops to enhance their resistance to insect pests may possibly influence the activity and abundance of natural enemies of insect pests. The ladybird beetle, Cheilomenes sexmaculatus (L.) might ingest <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> expressed by genetically modified plants by feeding on aphids, early instar larvae of lepidopterans, and other soft bodied insects feeding on transgenic plants. Therefore, we studied the effects of Cry 1 Ab and Cry 1 Ac <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> on C. sexmaculatus under direct and indirect exposure conditions. For direct exposure, the neonate C. sexmaculatus larvae were fed either pure 2 M sucrose (control) or sucrose solution containing Cry 1 Ab or Cry 1 Ac (0. 1 %), and on alternate days with aphids till pupation. Direct exposure of C. sexmaculatus larvae to <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> resulted in reduced larval survival and adult emergence {{as compared to the}} controls, which might be due to long-term direct exposure. However, there were no adverse effects of the <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> on C. sexmaculatus when the larvae were reared on Aphis craccivora Koch fed on different concentrations of Cry 1 Ab or Cry 1 Ac in the artificial diet. A significant and positive correlation was observed between the presence of <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> in aphids, and coccinellid larvae and adults (r= 0. 53 ** to 0. 86 **). The results suggested that a direct exposure to <b>Bt</b> <b>toxins</b> expressed in transgenic plants or predation on H. armigera on Bt-transgenic plants will have little effect on the activity and abundance of the ladybird, C. sexmaculatus...|$|R

50|$|Bacillus thuringiensis is a {{bacterial}} disease that affects Lepidopterans {{and some other}} insects. Toxins produced by strains of this bacterium are used as a larvicide against caterpillars, beetles, and mosquitoes.

Because these toxins have little effect on other organisms, they are considered more environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides. The toxin from B. thuringiensis (<b>Bt</b> <b>toxin)</b> has been incorporated directly into plants {{through the use of}} genetic engineering.
