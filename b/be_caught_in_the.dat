5|$|Another {{indication}} that feet and other tetrapod traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic is how they were feeding. They {{did not have the}} modifications of the skull and jaw that allowed them to swallow prey on land. Prey could <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shallows, at the water's edge or on land, but had to be eaten in water where hydrodynamic forces from the expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E
5|$|The concept, which {{originated}} in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, was {{to remove the}} reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be multiple rings of defensive walls, one inside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured. If assailants made it past {{the first line of}} defence they would <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall.|$|E
5|$|Yonekura {{and his men}} {{had reached}} Kaiapit after an {{exhausting}} night march. Yonekura was aware that the Australians had reached Kaiapit but his main concern was not to <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open by Allied aircraft. Spotting Australian positions in the pre-dawn light, the Japanese column opened fire. A torrent of fire descended on the Australians, who replied sporadically, attempting to conserve their ammunition. Although he was running low on ammunition, King launched an immediate counter-attack on the Japanese, which took them by surprise.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately for the Patriots, {{they would}} <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of a}} bizarre Super Bowl week subplot. Prior to the AFC Championship game, Irving Fryar had cut two fingers with a kitchen knife, {{requiring}} them {{to be put in}} a cast.

It was a distraction that, many thought, epitomized the history of these Patriots – coming as it did in what was otherwise to that point the franchise's finest hour.|$|E
25|$|The various {{techniques}} of fast bowling {{lend themselves to}} three ways of getting the batsman out. They may be bowled or caught LBW either by speed, the yorker or by seam or swing causing the ball to move in toward them, in which case placement of fielders is irrelevant. Swing or seam may be employed to move the ball away from the batsman {{in which case the}} ball will strike the outside edge of the bat and may <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slips. A badly-played bouncer will either fly off the outside edge as above or may result in a mistimed shot that can be caught near the boundary.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years Two Harbors {{consisted}} of two separate communities called Agate Bay and Burlington. The village of Burlington along Burlington Bay was platted in 1856, first incorporated on May 23, 1857; it had a post office that operated from 1856 until 1862. The first residence constructed in Agate Bay was owned by Thomas Sexton (1854), he created a fourteen by sixteen foot shack. The early settlers lived in primitive conditions, which was common for both the area and time. Their homes were made of logs and had dirt floors. Diets often consisted of homegrown vegetables and animals that could <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area (at that time there were many dense forests, so deer meat was not an abundant food source).|$|E

25|$|A ball {{rotating}} {{around the}} seam will move either {{right or left}} when it hits the pitch, depending on which way the ball is spinning. A ball bouncing to the right {{is said to be}} an off cutter as it is travelling from off stump to leg stump for a right-handed batsman. Conversely, a ball that bounces to the left is a leg cutter, travelling from leg to off stump for a right-handed batsman. Cutters are usually aimed so that they hit the pitch just outside the batsman's off stump and move away from the wicket. This will cause the ball to catch the outside edge of the bat instead of the middle and fly up to <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slips.|$|E
25|$|Voting in most Irish {{constituencies}} {{occurred on}} 14 December 1918. While {{the rest of}} the United Kingdom fought the 'Khaki election' on other issues involving the British parties, in Ireland four major political parties had national appeal. These were the IPP, Sinn Féin, the Irish Unionist Party and the Irish Labour Party. The Labour Party, however, decided not to participate in the election, fearing that it would <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> political crossfire between the IPP and Sinn Féin; it thought it better to let the people make up their minds on the issue of Home Rule versus a Republic by having a clear two-way choice between the two nationalist parties. The Unionist Party favoured continuance of the union with Britain (along with its subordinate, the Ulster Unionist Labour Association, who fought as 'Labour Unionists'). A number of other small nationalist parties also took part.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{were set}} {{a target of}} 239 for victory, and {{although}} {{that would have made}} it the highest-scoring innings in the match, they had five sessions in which to do it. However, what followed was a master-class in bowling from Broad, who took seven wickets for 44 runs in just 11 overs – his best Test figures – as New Zealand were bowled out for 68, their sixth-lowest score in Tests against England. Only BJ Watling and Neil Wagner managed to make it into double figures, theirs being two of the three wickets that Broad did not manage to take. Watling was not helped by a knee injury he had picked up on day 3 that meant McCullum had to keep wicket {{for the rest of the}} innings, but he nevertheless came out to bat, only to <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slips off Anderson for 13. Wagner's wicket was the last to fall; it looked as though he would be caught after hitting the ball straight up in the air to long leg, but the fielder missed the catch. In the confusion that followed, the ball was thrown back to Anderson at the bowler's end with Wagner stranded mid-pitch in the middle of his second run. With that, the day's play concluded with 14 wickets in less than two sessions and England went 1–0 up in the two-match series.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} inhabitants on the Kurnell Peninsula {{were the}} Gweagal people, a clan of the Tharawal (or Dharawal) tribe who occupied {{the region for}} thousands of years. Their tribe spanned the areas between the Cooks and Georges Rivers from the shores of Botany Bay and westwards towards Liverpool. According to a Gweagal elder, Dharawal {{is similar to a}} state and Gweagal is similar to a shire within the state, Cunnel (Kurnell) is a family village within the shire. A clan consisted of approximately 20 to 50 people who lived in their own territory. They had no written language and each tribe had its own dialect. They knew how to light fires long before the arrival of white man. Their clothing consisted of a woven hair sash in which they used to carry tools and weapons and sometimes the optional possum-skin coat for the winter season. The Gweagal Aborigines were the northernmost tribe of the Dharawal nation. They fished from canoes or from the shore using barbed spears and fishing lines with hooks in and around Botany Bay and the Georges River. Waterfowl could <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> swamplands (Towra Point), and the variety of soils would have supported a variety of edible and medicinal plants. Birds and their eggs, possums, wallabies and goannas were also a part of their staple diet, in which they made fur coats and ceremonial attire. The abundance of fish and other foodstuffs in these heavily timbered waterways meant that these natives were less nomadic than those of Outback Australia. The various middens, rock carvings and paintings in the area confirm this.|$|E
