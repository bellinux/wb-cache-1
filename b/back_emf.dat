40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{comparing}} control techniques for two existing permanent mag-net motors with harmonics in their <b>back</b> <b>emfs.</b> To do so, ideal models of a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor and a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) have been modi-fied {{to describe the}} behavior of two existing permanent magnet motors. Comparisons of the motor constant and the relative torque ripple are performed when the motors are controlled with Field Oriented Control (FOC) {{as well as with}} traditional BLDC control. A novel control scheme aiming at controlling the currents to have the same shape as the <b>back</b> <b>emfs</b> are presented. Simulations are performed to show how this method affects the motor constant and relative torque ripple. Torque ripple due to phase commutation in BLDC motors is discussed and a version of lead angle adjustment is implemented to reduce this problem.

2500|$|An {{inductor}} {{consists of}} a coiled conductor. Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction gives the <b>back</b> <b>emf</b> (voltage opposing current) due to a rate-of-change of magnetic flux density [...] through a current loop.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{armature}} windings of a direct-current or universal motor are moving through a magnetic field, {{they have a}} voltage induced in them. This voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called [...] "back electromotive force (emf)". The voltage {{is proportional to the}} running speed of the motor. The <b>back</b> <b>emf</b> of the motor, plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes, must equal the voltage at the brushes. This provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a DC motor. If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower <b>back</b> <b>emf</b> results, and more current is drawn from the supply. This increased current provides the additional torque to balance the new load.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{locomotive}} accelerates, the now-rotating motor armatures {{will start to}} generate a counter-electromotive force (<b>back</b> <b>EMF,</b> meaning the motors are also trying to act as generators), which will oppose {{the output of the}} main generator and cause traction motor current to decrease. Main generator voltage will correspondingly increase in an attempt to maintain motor power, but will eventually reach a plateau. At this point, {{the locomotive}} will essentially cease to accelerate, unless on a downgrade. Since this plateau will usually be reached at a speed substantially less than the maximum that may be desired, something must be done to change the drive characteristics to allow continued acceleration. This change is referred to as [...] "transition," [...] a process that is analogous to shifting gears in an automobile.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{permanent}} magnets (PMs) and armature windings of partitioned stator (PS) PM machines {{are located in}} two separate inner and outer stators, their positions can be exchanged to optimize the space utilization, especially in radial field rotating machines. Therefore, in this paper, the influence of PM and armature winding stator positions on the electromagnetic performance of PS-PM machines is investigated {{based on the novel}} PS-PM machines (PS-PMMs) with surface-mounted PM (SPM) stator. Similar to the single-stator surface-mounted PMMs (SS-PMMs), flexible rotor pole number, bipolar phase flux linkage, and symmetrical phase <b>back</b> electromotive force (<b>EMF)</b> are also obtained in PS-PMMs. Based on the same 12 / 10 stator/rotor pole number combination, PS-PMM-I (PMs located in the inner stator) and PS-PMM-II (PMs located in the outer stator) exhibit 120 % and 160 % higher phase <b>back</b> <b>EMFs</b> as well as 120 % and 139 % larger average torques, respectively, than the SS-PMM together almost without scarifying the PM utilization efficiency under the same machine size and the same rated copper loss. Further, the proposed PS-PMM-IIs have both higher phase <b>back</b> <b>EMFs</b> and larger average torques than PS-PMM-Is among all the main stator/rotor pole number combinations. Meanwhile, for both PS-PMM-Is and PS-PMM-IIs with 12 -pole stator, the machines with the 11 -pole rotor exhibit the optimal torque capabilities. Moreover, the reluctance torque is also negligible in the proposed PS-PMMs due to very low saliency ratio. The analyses are validated by experiment results of the prototype machine...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new adaptive torque estimation algorithm for an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) with parameter variations and cross-coupling between d- and q-axis dynamics. All cross-coupled, time-varying, or uncertain {{terms that are}} not part of the nominal flux equations are included in two equivalent mutual inductances, which are described using the equivalent d- and q-axis <b>back</b> electromotive forces (<b>EMFs).</b> The proposed algorithm estimates the equivalent d- and q-axis <b>back</b> <b>EMFs</b> in a recursive and stability-guaranteed manner, in order to compute the equivalent mutual inductances between the d- and q-axes. Then, it provides a more accurate and adaptive torque equation by adding the correction terms obtained from the computed equivalent mutual inductances. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that torque estimation errors are remarkably reduced by capturing and compensating for the inherent cross-coupling effects and parameter variations adaptively, using the proposed algorithm...|$|R

40|$|PM {{brushless}} DC (BLDC) motors {{should be}} fed by square-wave currents synchronized with the <b>back</b> <b>emfs</b> {{to develop a}} constant torque with the required value. In practice, phase inductances and limited source voltage produce non ideal square-wave currents and unbalanced phase currents during commutations. Such phenomena affect the torque developed by the PM BLDC drives by deviating its value from the requested one and by giving rise to torque ripple. In this paper, an analytical study of the torque characteristics, namely motor torque and torque ripple, of PM BLDC drives is carried out {{as a function of}} the motor speed and is supported by experimental data. Torque characteristics are expressed in terms of a quantity distinctive of the motor, thus giving a generalized formulation to the results...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{experimental}} results of 3 -phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) sensorless speed control are presented. To estimate the rotor position, a sliding mode current observer (SMCO) was implemented. This observer estimates the <b>back</b> <b>emfs</b> {{of the motor}} in the stationary reference frame using only the measured voltages and currents of the motor. These emfs were utilized to obtain the rotor position. The speed of the motor was calculated by differentiating the rotor position angle. The stability of the proposed SMCO was verified using Lyapunov method to determine the observer gain. The saturation function was adopted {{in order to reduce}} the chattering phenomenon caused by the SMCO. A vector control method was employed to achieve the sensorless drive system. The control application was developed in C/C++ language and implemented using the Texas Instruments TMS 320 LF 2812 digital signal processor (DSP).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to study a medium voltage {{brushless}} DC (BLDC) motor for the Cascaded Cell Commutated (CCC) drive topology for high power applications. Presently AC motors and drives are dominant industrial solutions in both low and medium voltage drives. They have advanced machine design and control technology. However, the DC machines still have better speed control, higher starting torque and more power density. The main aim of this project to develop the CCC drive in order to compete better with DC motors allowing replace the brushes by electronically commutator.

40|$|Due to {{the special}} doubly-salient structure, flux-reversal {{permanent}} magnet (FRPM) machines typically suffer from relatively large torque and speed ripples, as well as acoustic noise and vibration, especially at low speeds.

In this paper, an improved configuration of FRPM machine is proposed by introducing a small space-gap between the two adjacent magnets belonging to the same stator tooth to improve the symmetry of phase back-EMF waveform. The influence of the small space-gap on phase back-EMF waveform is evaluated by employing 2 D finite element analysis (FEA), and consequently, an optimal value of space-gap for a more sinusoidal back-EMF waveform is obtained...|$|R
