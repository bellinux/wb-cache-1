25|$|Kannur {{district}} has had industrial importance from very early days. With {{a variety of}} natural and man-made resources including fertile soil, amenable climate, rich forests, fishing potential and minerals along with road, rail and inland water transport links, the district offers ample scope {{for the development of}} industries. Nevertheless, Kannur is an industrially backward district. There is only one major and five mini industrial estates in the district. Keltron Complex, Mangattuparamba and Western India Plywood's, Valappattanam are the two major industries. Western India Plywoods {{is one of the biggest}} wood <b>based</b> <b>industrial</b> complexes in South East Asia. The {{district has}} 12 medium-scale industries, most of which are either cotton textile or plywood manufacturing.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{therefore}} fitting {{to see the}} year 1815, in which the United Kingdom of the Netherlands embodied a newly independent political incorporation of the original Habsburg Netherlands, {{as the end of}} an economic era also. The hoped for economic resurgence of the Netherlands (other than [...] that of the Southern Netherlands with which it was now temporarily reunited) would, however, not really take flight before the structural problems of the old economy were finally laid to rest around 1850 with the final liquidation of the public debt of the old Republic. This explains at least partly why the Dutch economy was so tardy in implementing the steam-power <b>based</b> <b>industrial</b> revolution of the 19th century.|$|E

40|$|Sponsored Report (for Acquisition Research Program) Over {{the past}} twenty years, {{following}} the end of the Cold War, the defense <b>industrial</b> <b>base</b> in the US has witnessed many changes and continues to face new challenges. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the evolution of the US and global defense <b>industrial</b> <b>base</b> in response to the shifting economic and strategic landscape. Specifically, it examines the impact of macroeconomic factors on the defense <b>industrial</b> <b>bases</b> in the US and overseas, and discusses the trends in fiscal debts and deficits and their potential impact on military spending. Second, it discusses the impact of the shift in defense priorities toward irregular warfare and away from conventional warfare on the defense <b>industrial</b> <b>base,</b> and discusses areas of growth, as well as potential shrinkage. Third, it evaluates the ability of large defense contractors to compete with smaller firms in growing market spaces due to rising legacy overhead costs, as well as the financial impact of the strategic business base shift of large defense contractors. The analysis then assesses the development of the global defense <b>industrial</b> <b>base</b> and the role of foreign contractors in the US defense <b>industrial</b> <b>base.</b> In examining global supply chain arrangements, which promote interlinkages between domestic <b>industrial</b> <b>bases,</b> the study looks at the role of exchange rate volatility and declining military spending on defense products. Finally, the analysis examines the greater overseas orientation of elements of the US defense <b>industrial</b> <b>base</b> which are focused on traditional military equipment, as well as the growth of overseas defense <b>industrial</b> <b>bases.</b> Acquisition Research Progra...|$|R
