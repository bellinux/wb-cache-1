The vehicles tested included a Wrightbus-bodied single decker owned by FirstGroup, a Plaxton President-bodied Dennis Trident 2 double decker from Lothian Buses, {{and a white}} Alexander Dennis Enviro500 triple-axled double decker. The test vehicles were fitted with sensors to assess vibration levels and ride quality.Hot weather testing of the track took place during May/June 2010.In addition to the bus fleet, Cambridgeshire County Council trialled and purchased a specially adapted [...] "guided gritter" [...] lorry for use during periods of cold weather, which will spray salt water rather than rock salt. [...] In November 2011 this was augmented with a customised [...] "Multihog" [...] gritter/snowplough vehicle from Ireland designed for clearing the accompanying maintenance track and cycleway. The Multihog is powered by 90-horsepower engine allowing it to travel at up to 40 km/h and features a <b>brine</b> <b>tank,</b> rather than solid grit.|$|E

50|$|The Lion Salt Works {{was built}} in 1894 when John Thompson Junior and Henry Ingram Thompson {{purchased}} {{the site of the}} Red Lion Hotel, ajdacent to the bridge on the Ollershaw Lane in Marston. John Thompson Junior retired shortly afterwards to Eddisbury Hall in Macclesfield. Henry Ingram Thompson sunk a brine shaft, built a <b>brine</b> <b>tank</b> and engine house and built the first pan and stove house (number 1) on site around the Red Lion Hotel. By 1899 the Red Lion Hotel had been demolished and two cottages converted to the Red Lion Inn. This allowed them to build two further pan and stove houses (2 and 3). On site there were also two butter pans and two fishery pans. A Manager's House and Smithy were built at the south-west of the site. By 1906 a mineral railway had been built that extended to the south of the site. Henry Ingram Thompson ran the site with his sons Jack Thompson and Alan Kinsey Thompson. The salt works exported salt to Canada, North America and West Africa. The domestic market saw salt sold to Cheshire, Manchester and Liverpool.|$|E

The arrival of ice plants and <b>brine</b> <b>tanks</b> on seiners changed the previous fishing industry, where the handliners had to be within an hour's row of the cannery to prevent the catch from spoiling, {{and led to the}} canning outports' decline.

50|$|A {{purse seiner}} is a fishing vessel {{which uses a}} {{traditional}} method of catching tuna and other school fish species. A large net {{is set in a}} circle around a school of fish while on the surface. The net is then pursed, closing the bottom of the net, then pulling up the net until the fish are caught alongside the vessel. Most of these types of vessels then transfer the fish into a <b>tank</b> filled with <b>brine</b> (extra salty refrigerated water). This freezes large amounts of fish quickly. Trip lengths can vary from 20 to 70 days depending on the fishing. The fish is held in refrigerated <b>brine</b> <b>tanks</b> and unloads either directly to the canneries or is trans-shipped to carrier vessels to freight to the canneries, leaving the purse seine vessel close to the fishing grounds to continue fishing. Purse seiners longer than 70 metres are called super seiners.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{establishing}} the relationships between house, rind and core microbiotas of cheese varieties manufactured at the same industrial dairy plant. Caciotta and Caciocavallo Pugliese cheeses were chosen as model systems. Mesophilic lactobacilli, cocci and, especially, thermophilic cocci were the most abundant cultivable bacteria found on equipment, which were located in the production area. According to cell counts, catabolic profiles of microbial communities deriving from equipment, and cheese core and rind differed. As shown by 16 S rRNA targeted metagenomics, Streptococcus thermophilus dominated the communities from knife surface, <b>brine</b> <b>tank,</b> curds and core cheeses {{as well as it}} was the main colonizing bacterium from drain table, rinds and ripening room of Caciocavallo Pugliese cheeses. Compared to S. thermophilus, the other starters used (. Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus helveticus) showed low relative abundance in cheeses and/or colonization capability. A set of other genera/species, which varied depending on the equipment surfaces and cheese making, contributed to the formation of a rather heterogeneous house microbiota. Representatives from such communities had (e. g., Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum group) or not (e. g., Actinobacteria) the capacity to colonize cheeses, which depended on the variety (Caciocavallo Pugliese or Caciotta cheese) and layer (rind or core). Other genera/species were mainly associated to the rind and ripening room of Caciotta (. Staphylococcus species and Brochothrix spp.) or Caciocavallo Pugliese (.

40|$|Artificial ground {{freezing}} (AGF) {{is a process}} used to strengthen soil and rock by freezing trapped pore water. Freezing is accomplished by pumping calcium chloride brine, chilled to approximately – 30 ˚C in ammonia refrigeration plants, through heat exchangers drilled into the ground. A knowledge gap exists {{in the field of}} AGF regarding the relationship between the performance of the refrigeration plants and the ground heat removal process. The coupling of these two aspects of AGF requires knowledge of the plant’s refrigeration capacity as a function of many factors; the most important of which is the temperature of the brine returning from the freeze pipes. However, refrigeration plant manufacturers do not provide sufficient information about the plant’s performance as a function of brine temperature. Typically, AGF plants are only rated at one operating point due to the impracticality in experimentally rating such large plants and the lack of any standard test methods. Refrigeration system models available in the existing literature do not emulate the compressor control system responsible for preventing compressor overloading. Therefore, the goal of this research is to develop a model that can predict the performance of an AGF refrigeration plant over a range of operating points, using plant specifications that are readily available in the documentation provided by the manufacturer of the plant. To fill the knowledge gap, a thermodynamic model is developed of an existing 1500 TR AGF plant at Cameco’s Cigar Lake mine. The Cigar Lake plant uses flooded shell-and-tube evaporators, two-stage economized twin screw compressors, and air cooled condensers packaged into five refrigeration modules. Each component in the system, including the evaporator, compressor, and condenser, is modeled individually, and then the individual models are combined to calculate the overall system capacity. The model emulates the behavior of the compressor’s slide valves, which are used to limit the plant capacity, limit suction pressure, control intermediate pressure, and control the discharge pressures in the system. In addition, the model accounts for the effects of the oil injection into the screw compressors, which cools the compressors and seals the spaces between the lobes of the compressor rotors. The model is validated using operating data from the Cigar Lake plant, which was collected over a period of eight months by plant operators. After calibration, the modeled plant capacities and the temperature of the brine leaving the refrigeration plant are found to be in agreement with the measured capacities and brine temperatures. The overall plant capacity results match measured capacities within ± 14 %, and the predicted brine temperatures match the measured values leaving the plant within ± 5 %. The modeled capacities match the measured capacities within the uncertainty in the measured data. The simulation of the Cigar Lake plant demonstrates that the performance of the plant is highly dependent upon the temperature of the brine returning to the plant. For example, a ± 10 % change in brine temperature causes a 22 % overall change in the capacity of the refrigeration plant. The simulation also demonstrates that, even with the plant’s air cooled condensers, changes in the ambient temperature have little effect on the performance of the plant with the existing equipment. Furthermore, the results show that the selected suction pressure of the second compression stage, or intermediate pressure, affects the performance of the refrigeration plant. These findings lead to important plant performance optimization opportunities. An optimization study using the model demonstrates that, by selecting a lower intermediate temperature than what the existing literature suggests, an improvement in overall refrigeration plant capacity of 3 % can be achieved. Additional simulations identify the <b>brine</b> <b>tank,</b> which allows for different brine flow rates to exist on the field and plant side of the tank, as an inefficient component in the system. The <b>brine</b> <b>tank</b> not only cools the brine returning from the field before it is pumped to the refrigeration modules but it allows heat to be transferred between the warm and cold brine. By eliminating the tank, plumbing all of the refrigeration modules in parallel, and installing appropriately sized evaporators, the capacity of the refrigeration plant can be increased by 17 %. Further capacity gains can be realized by upgrading the evaporators to increase their capacity...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the inoculation described in this paper was to test the feasibility of culturing Artemia in man-made earthen salterns and of producing adults and cysts for use in aquaculture projects in the Philippines.

5000|$|In the mid-1920s, Shikrey Baddour, a Lebanese {{immigrant}} from nearby Goldsboro, first saw {{opportunity in the}} wasted cucumber crops of area farmers. Baddour {{came up with the}} idea of buying the cucumbers, putting them in a <b>brining</b> <b>tank,</b> and selling the brined cucumbers, or brine stock, to other pickle firms. Baddour enlisted the aid of George Moore, a sailor from Wilmington who had worked in a Castle Hayne pickle plant. The plan didn't work the way they had envisioned, however: they had no buyers for their product.By January 1926, a new plan was put into place through the efforts of a group of Mount Olive business people,led by Headley Morris Cox, who formally established the Mt. Olive Pickle Company, Inc. to pack and sell its own pickles. Thirty-seven original shareholders put forward $19,000 in capital to get the company started in what all viewed as a [...] "community proposition." [...] Many of today's stockholders are grandchildren and great grandchildren of the charter stockholders.The board of directors hired H.M. Cox as President, Moore as factory superintendent and Baddour as salesman and gave them each shares of stock for their initial investments. The board also purchased 1 acre of land from farmer J.A. Westbrook for $1,000. The land is part of the current manufacturing site today. Westbrook's home still stands across from the plant. Mt. Olive surpassed $500,000 in sales in 1942. The company initiated a profit-sharing plan in 1943 and by 1947 its sales reached more than $1 million a year.|$|R
40|$|The {{use of a}} multi-ecological tracer {{approach}} provides {{valuable and}} complementary insights to investigate the complex biology and ecology of large pelagic fish. Brine immersion freezing {{is the most common}} preservation technique used onboard for large fish to be frozen whole until they are delivered for sale and processing. We evaluated the effect of brine freezing on lipid and fatty acid composition, C and N stable isotope ratios, and organochlorine contaminant levels of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis). Fresh tunas were stored in a saturated sodium chlorine <b>brine</b> immersion <b>tank</b> maintained at - 20 A degrees C for 6 weeks, and ecological tracers were analysed on dorsal muscle samples collected before and after brine freezing. No significant effect of the fish preservation technique was found except for delta N- 15 whose signatures slightly increased after a 6 -week period of brine immersion. Because N isotopic shift was close to the analytical precision and probably related to a higher risk of salt penetration in small tunas with abraded skin, we consider our results as conservative and conclude that ecological tracers can indeed be analysed on brine-freezing-preserved tunas...|$|R

The determination of the rates and pathways of degradation have facilitated prediction of how the hazard changes with time and altered storage conditions.

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that areas such as Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Essex were {{intensely}} exploited for salt in the Iron Age and Romano-British periods. Previous research has tended to focus on the eastern coast of Britain, with less attention being paid to other potential salt-producing areas. In previous studies in southern Britain, much emphasis has been placed on the distribution of salt and the ‘equipment’ used to produce and potentially transport salt - briquetage. Much less {{attention has been paid to}} the production process. This research project directly addresses this imbalance, by placing the emphasis on to the study of the production sites, and by creating and analysing a new dataset to contextualise sites using a holistic perspective. The analysis of salt-production sites has redefined the archaeological terminology for salt production, and has critically evaluated how these sites have been incorporated into the archaeological record. The re-categorisation of the archaeological remains on a site by site basis has enabled the formation of a comprehensive dataset for the first time. This has enabled a regional and chronological comparison of salt-production in southern Britain to be undertaken. The analysis has shown that despite problems of incorrect perceptions of salt production practices, inconsistent recording and categorisation, and severe site damage by human and natural forces, it is possible, to inject concepts of ‘agency’ and ‘identity’ into these sites by exploring evidence of technological choice and use of space. It was possible to identify distinctive ‘working areas’ containing features (hearths and <b>brine</b> <b>tanks)</b> where the main stages of salt-production were carried out. New ‘Modes of Salt-Production’ have been created in order to compare different methods of organisation and ‘site management’ across time and space. These modes enable a new approach about salt-production to be made set in the wider context of supply networks and specific consumer markets. This research has shown that there were significant regional and chronological variations in salt-production; with three main areas of activity identified in Somerset, Dorset and Kent. The most significant chronological change was the substantial increase in salt-production during the 1 st century A. D. followed by its decline in the 2 nd century A. D in Kent and Dorset. However, this was not the case in Somerset, where the dominant period of salt-production occurred between the 2 nd and 4 th centuries A. D. The identification of regional trends in the scale and organisation of production, as well as the rich diversity of sites, shows that producers adapted to changes in the supply and consumption of salt over time. Considerably more salt would have been required to supply the growing population in the 1 st century A. D and this encouraged the creation of many new production sites. However, the diversity in site character suggests that there was little tight control of coastal salt-production sites at that time. It is argued that instead, focus was placed upon the exploitation of salt from inland brine springs in Cheshire and Worcestershire. This is evidenced in the organisation, technology and creation of military supply bases close to these sites. Instead, it is argued that the Roman invasion formalised and expanded existing supply networks from coastal salt-production sites, in addition to creating new inland networks. This resulted in the creation of more formal ‘production and/or distribution centres. It is also probable that the emergence of uniform salt-production sites in Somerset in the later Roman period, reflects that this area had become predominant for the supply of salt to major ‘consumer sites such as legionary fortresses and the larger towns...|$|R
40|$|A {{system to}} {{generate}} a 1 - to 3 -gallon per minute stream of 350 F (177 C) simulated geothermal brine is discussed. A 10, 000 -gallon tank serves as the <b>brine</b> holding <b>tank.</b> The solution is prepared by diluting 26 % sodium chloride, derived from a Gulf Coast salt dome with steam condensate, deaerating, heating the brine to 350 F in a steam heat exchanger, injecting the desired cations and anions into a flowing stream with chemical injection pumps, and mixing with in-line mixers. Non-scaling cations are normally added to the 10, 000 -gallon base brine solution; anions, such as bicarbonate, silicate, etc. are injected as the sodium salts. Sulfide is injected separately as sodium sulfide solution. Hydrochloric acid is injected to adjust pH to the desired 6 - 8 pH unit range. Composition of the resulting simulated geothermal brine may be varied over wide ranges for each component. The system is presently in operation on a hydrogen sulfide oxidation study while heat exchangers are being constructed for the scaling studies. Two heat exchanger systems will be used. The first is a large U-tube exchanger designed to receive the hot brine on the shell side with cool water circulating in the tubes. The second {{is a series of}} three smaller straight tube exchangers with the hot brine in the tube side. Both systems will be completely instrumented to measure heat transfer coefficients in each exchanger. Proposed experiments include: addition of scale control agents, injection of carbon dioxide to prevent carbonate scaling, and exploration of the effects of electrical and magnetic fields on scaling...|$|R
40|$|Currently, all transoceanic vessels {{entering}} the Great Lakes must perform ballast water exchange or saltwater flushing, procedures {{designed to reduce}} the risk of new biological invasions from ballast water. Vessels not in compliance with these regulations presently have limited, often costly, and/or time-consuming alternatives available. Treatment with sodium chloride brine at an initial concentration of 230 ‰ has been proposed as an emergency ballast water management option and is examined here. Six shipboard trials were conducted under operational conditions to determine the efficacy of brine ballast water treatment. Trials were conducted on three vessels with full ballast tanks and on three vessels with only residual ballast water. <b>Brine</b> distribution in <b>tanks</b> was adequate, noting that vessel movement was essential to ensure mixing into ballast water or ballast residuals. Once mixing has occurred, approximately 25. hour exposure to 45 ‰ brine or 1 hour exposure to 115 ‰ brine is required to effectively exterminate freshwater zooplankton.

40|$|Table olives {{have been}} a {{component}} of the Mediterranean diet for centuries and their consumption is increasing worldwide because of their nutritional and palatable characteristics. The raw olive drupe is inedible because of its high content in a bitter glucoside named oleuropein, which is hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions during the two most popular methods of preparing table olives, the Spanish-style green olives and the California-style black olives. Moreover, natural olives are those that do not suffer the alkaline treatment but lose their bitterness slowly for months due to the acid hydrolysis of the oleuropein (1). Recently, a new and rapid method to debitter olives has been proposed, which is based on the oxidation of the oleuropein (2). However, this method has failed in some cases and a study has been carried out to optimize this new process. Olives preserved in acidified <b>brine</b> into industrial <b>tanks</b> were maintained under oxygen overpressure for several days and the phenolic content was analyzed. The reduction in olives of the oleuropein concentration ranged from 30 to 100 %, being lower as the storage time in tanks progressed. As it has been previously reported (2), the enzyme polyphenoloxidase catalyzes the oxidation reaction of oleuropein giving rise to non-bitter products. Likewise, the activity of this enzyme is highly reduced in preserved olives (3). Hence, it was hypothesized that the debittering must be carried out soon after brining of olives. New oxidation experiments were performed with olives stored just only one month in the acidified brines and the reduction of oleuropein concentration in fruit reached 90 - 95 %. These results open the possibility of debittering natural olives {{in just a few days}} instead of months without the use of sodium hydroxide, which is not allowed for organic table olives in many countries.
