500|$|The {{value of}} horses {{was known to}} all. In 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele, men at the front {{understood}} that [...] "at this stage to lose a horse was worse than losing a man <b>because</b> <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> men were replaceable while horses weren't." [...] For Britain, horses were considered so valuable that if a soldier's horse was killed or died he was required to cut off a hoof {{and bring it back}} to his commanding officer to prove that the two had not simply become separated.|$|E
500|$|On {{the way to}} Constantinople, Cacambo {{reveals that}} Cunégonde—now horribly ugly—currently washes dishes {{on the banks of}} the Propontis as a slave for a Transylvanian prince by the name of Rákóczi. After {{arriving}} at the Bosphorus, they board a galley where, to Candide's surprise, he finds Pangloss and Cunégonde's brother among the rowers. Candide buys their freedom and further passage at steep prices. The baron and Pangloss relate how they survived, but despite the horrors he has been through, Pangloss's optimism remains unshaken: [...] "I still hold to my original opinions, <b>because,</b> <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> I'm a philosopher, and it wouldn't be proper for me to recant, since Leibniz cannot be wrong, and since pre-established harmony is the most beautiful thing in the world, along with the plenum and subtle matter." ...|$|E

30|$|In our {{proposed}} model, the PN between SUi and PU 2 {{proved to}} be unsuccessful, <b>because,</b> <b>after</b> performing <b>all</b> the cooperation steps, the utility functions of both of the users remain unchanged, resulting in spectrum sharing disagreement.|$|R

"If {{it should}} be asked why was the present plan adopted in {{preference}} to any other, the answer is, <b>because,</b> <b>after</b> taking <b>all</b> circumstances into consideration, {{it appeared to be}} the best; or, in other and more proper terms, attended with the least inconvenience."— The Commission, from their [...] "Remarks" ...|$|R
500|$|The {{second part}} of the Memorial {{described}} suggestions for the social and political organization of Indian communities relative to colonial ones. Las Casas advocated the dismantlement of the city of Asunción and the subsequent gathering of Indians into communities of about 1,000 Indians to be situated as satellites of Spanish towns or mining areas. Here, Las Casas argued, Indians could be better governed, better taught and indoctrinated in the Christian faith, and would be easier to protect from abuse than if they were in scattered settlements. Each town would have a royal hospital built with four wings {{in the shape of a}} cross, where up to 200 sick Indians could be cared for at a time. He described in detail social arrangements, distribution of work, how provisions would be divided and even how table manners were to be introduced. Regarding expenses, he argued that [...] "this should not seem expensive or difficult, <b>because</b> <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> everything comes from them [...] and they work for it and it is theirs." [...] He even drew up a budget of each pueblo's expenses to cover wages for administrators, clerics, Bachelors of Latin, doctors, surgeons, pharmacists, advocates, ranchers, miners, muleteers, hospitalers, pig herders, fishermen, etc. He showed that this arrangement could easily be maintained and gold still be extracted at a profit.|$|E
500|$|Kyle, Cartman, Stan, [...] and Kenny enjoy a {{nice day}} outside with the weather being warm until {{a large group of}} Harley riders disturb them. The {{residents}} of South Park are frustrated by a large group of Harley riders frequently making noise in town. The Harley riders eat lunch and talk about how nobody is paying attention to them, so one of the Harley riders comes up with a noise to get everyone's attention. Before the Harley riders take off, Cartman confronts the bikers, describing them as insecure losers who ride loud motorcycles to draw attention to themselves. Cartman tells them their behavior makes them look like [...] "fags" [...] and, when other children begin referring to the bikers with the same slur, the bikers assume they are being insulted because they are not being loud enough. They believe that they should be louder <b>because</b> <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> children are around loud stuff today (such as the Xbox 360 and Surround sound system). The motorcyclists equip their motorcycles with horns, sirens and various musical instruments. The boys devise a plan to rid the town of the bikers. However, once Butters reveals that he likes Harley motorcycles, he is not allowed to participate in the scheme. As the riders eat at a diner, Cartman defecates on the seats of their motorcycles while Kyle and Stan spray paint [...] "FAGS GET OUT" [...] on several buildings around town. The boys are pleased when the bikers temporarily leave town, but the graffiti alarms Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave because they interpret it as homophobia.|$|E

2500|$|There was {{evidence}} that Brawley's mother and King participated knowingly in the hoax. Neighbors told the grand jury that in February they overheard Glenda Brawley saying to King, [...] "You shouldn't have took the money <b>because</b> <b>after</b> it <b>all</b> comes out, they're {{going to find out}} the truth." [...] Another neighbor heard Mrs. Brawley say, [...] "They know we're lying and they're going to find out and come and get us." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I haven't enough," [...] Scott said, smiling. [...] "But I {{have some}} rich {{relations}} who might finance me if I could show them a sure snap. I'd {{like to do}} so, anyhow, <b>because,</b> <b>after</b> spending most <b>all</b> my money, I feel I've got to make good." ...|$|R
2500|$|In Clarke's {{authorized}} biography, Neil McAleer writes that: [...] "many {{readers and}} critics still consider Childhood's End Arthur C. Clarke's best novel." [...] But Clarke {{did not use}} ESP in any of his later stories, saying [...] "I've {{always been interested in}} ESP and, of course, Childhood's End was about that. But I've grown disillusioned, partly <b>because</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> this time they're still arguing about whether these things happen. I suspect that telepathy does happen." ...|$|E
2500|$|The god {{of death}} {{is an element of}} several {{religions}} in Westeros and Essos, on grounds from Martin that [...] "worship {{of death is}} an interesting basis for religion <b>because</b> <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> death is the one universal. It doesn't seem to matter what gods you pray to. We all die in the real world and in fantasy worlds. So if there was one culture where you did not die, I suspect that God would become very popular. They will promise us eternal life, but whatever". He also stated the belief [...] "that {{the world we live in}} was created by the evil god [...] kind of persuasive" [...] when [...] "you look at the world, particularly the Medieval world".|$|E

6000|$|... "The reason I {{want you}} to attend this meeting is <b>because</b> the schoolhouse, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> {{is the place where}} a real reform among the farmers must have its base. I'd like to see you working with us," [...] she said, turning {{suddenly}} towards him.|$|R
40|$|Title {{of short}} story: WHITING RICH AND STRANGE A story of ethnic {{people in an}} oil {{refinery}} town in NW Indiana. Comments are most welcome. This {{is part of a}} series of stories based in the industrial part of Chicago's Indiana suburbs. I am also placing the story in the Shakespeare group <b>because</b> [...] <b>after</b> <b>all</b> [...] it is a Romeo and Juliet story. "Rich and Strange' should need no explanation to those in Shakespeare group. This is a line from a song in _The Tempest_. Thanks, Gloria McMilla...|$|R
5000|$|In Defending Identity, Sharansky {{presents}} {{nationalism and}} religious commitment as a [...] "force for good," [...] not merely an ideology of evil. [...] "Strong identities are as valuable to a well-functioning society {{as they are}} to ... well-functioning individuals." [...] He writes that [...] "without identity, a democracy becomes incapable of defending the values it holds most dear." [...] He says religious identity [...] "is very difficult to neutralize with rational argument, <b>because</b> what, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> is the totalitarian regime trying to do? It’s trying to discover rational arguments to prove your physical survival on obedience." ...|$|R
60|$|Grace's eyes sparkled, for she saw {{where the}} hint led, but she hid her resentment, <b>because,</b> <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> she had doubts. Osborn needed money and Hayes was cunning.|$|E

6000|$|... "Point out what? Tell {{him that}} he oughtn't to be called Conway? <b>Because,</b> <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> I suppose that's the worst of it. If {{you mean to say}} that Dalrymple is in love with Mrs. Broughton, you never made a greater mistake in your life." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{project was}} {{assigned}} to John Houseman and was to be called Memo to a Bad Man. Houseman decided to change the milieu from New York theatre to Hollywood <b>because</b> he felt <b>after</b> <b>All</b> About Eve that a Hollywood setting would have more novelty. Clark Gable was originally attached to star; then Spencer Tracy. Eventually Kirk Douglas signed to play the lead. Vincente Minnelli was to direct.|$|R
50|$|The typical Holst story {{might be}} a gentle but twisted fable, such as {{the tale of a}} frog who, having become {{addicted}} to morphine during a laboratory experiment, was rejected by the woman whose kiss transformed him back into a prince <b>because</b> he was, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> only a junkie. Holst also wrote a number of paragraph-length prose pieces, which distilled a brief scene or anecdote into a glimmering, evanescent koan.|$|R
6000|$|Tennyson, {{according}} to Matthew Arnold, was not un esprit puissant. Other and younger critics, who have attained to a cock-certain mood of negation, {{are apt to}} blame him because, in fact, he did not finally agree with their opinions. If a man is necessarily a weakling or a hypocrite <b>because,</b> <b>after</b> trying <b>all</b> things, {{he is not an}} atheist or a materialist, then the reproach of insincerity or of feebleness of mind must rest upon Tennyson. But it is manifest that, almost in boyhood, he had already faced the ideas which, to one of his character, almost meant despair: he had not kept his eyes closed. To his extremely self-satisfied accusers we might answer, in lines from this earliest volume (The Mystic):- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And, therefore, <b>because</b> <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> though I profess Christianity, {{there is}} Jewish blood in my veins, I {{would have a}} {{marriage}} that must satisfy even my father when he regains his freedom, as I believe he will--for, after all, he is not charged with any sin against the faith." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--yes. Precisely! But where ELSE? That's the {{one half}} of the problem: supposing you do not agree to a logical {{progression}} in human social activity. <b>Because</b> <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> human society through the course of ages only enacts, spasmodically but still inevitably, the logical development of a given idea." ...|$|E
60|$|TARLETON. [again impressed] Thats an idea. Thats a new idea. I believe I {{ought to}} have made Johnny an author. Ive never said so before for fear of hurting his feelings, <b>because,</b> <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> the lad cant help it; but Ive never thought Johnny worth tuppence {{as a man of}} business.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see how {{it could}} have been easier to prevent than to undo your error. I don't admit it's an error, but I call it so <b>because</b> you do. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> an {{engagement}} is nothing but an open confession between two people that they are in love with each other and wish to marry. There need be no sort of pledge or promise to make the engagement binding, if there is love. It's the love that binds." ...|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{response}} to Take One has been mixed. Allmusic said that [...] "The songs aren’t horrible but they’re not memorable and neither are Lambert’s performances, but that’s unfair to him: these recordings {{were designed to}} sell middle-of-the-road pop with commercial aspirations and have absolutely no room for flair, since the whole point is to showcase the lyric and melody. Lambert acquits himself in that regard, sounding {{like nothing more than}} a demo singer <b>because</b> that was, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> what he was".|$|R
30|$|As expected, {{the lowest}} speeds {{for the first}} {{sections}} are presented {{at the end of}} the simulation time because only the “emer” and slow vehicles are presented. Any possible “charge” and fast vehicles have previously crossed this section. This concentration of the slower vehicles {{at the end of the}} simulation occurs only for the first sections, <b>because</b> <b>after</b> node 14, <b>all</b> “emer” vehicles have increased their SOC over the “charge” threshold, changing their status. In both analyzed scenarios, the average speeds of the traffic flow exceed 30  km/h.|$|R
6000|$|... "Including {{every sort}} of service. <b>Because,</b> <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> even supposing it is damnable to repeat prayers and creeds {{you do not}} believe in, and {{administer}} sacraments you think superstition, nobody can be damned but yourself. On the other hand if you express doubts that are not yet perfectly digested--you experiment with the souls of others...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Humour me," [...] the Prince begged. [...] "I {{am going}} {{to speak to you}} even more intimately. I shall venture to do so <b>because,</b> <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> she is better known to me than to you. I {{am going to}} tell you that of all the women in the world, Naida Karetsky is the most likely to make you happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is pretty}} well {{all of the}} story, I think. Sivajee Punt {{was one of the}} killed. The prisoners were all either hung or imprisoned for life.

50|$|The Georgia Southern Eagles {{took the}} field as the underdog and {{received}} very little respect or chance from the press, analysts, {{and of course the}} Falcon faithful. In fact, the MAC champion Falcon fans were insulted that they were paired with the Eagles <b>because</b> they were, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> conference champions and the Eagles were not. Mother Nature was not friendly as the teams took the field with on and off heavy rain and strong winds, but this would not change the task at hand.|$|R
50|$|Chaitanya das {{immediately}} {{fell over}} and lost consciousness. This is <b>because</b> he knew, <b>after</b> <b>all</b> this introduction, {{he could not}} withdraw his promise. It was too much. The gift was given {{and now it was}} taken back. Srinivas Acharya was taken away by this Sannyasi and then his transcendental career started. He came to Vrindavan and he became a disciple of Gopal Bhatta Goswami. Gopal Bhatta Goswami became his diksha guru. This was all arranged by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu personally and then even though he became initiated by Gopal Bhatta Goswami, he was sent for spiritual studies to Radha Damodar mandir, to Srila Jiva Goswami Prabhupada so he could learn the Vaisnava philosophy there.|$|R
5000|$|The freedom fries {{renaming}} was {{not without}} controversy or opposition. Timothy Noah of Slate noted that the move was [...] "meant to demonize France for its exasperating refusal to support a war against Iraq". He compared the 2003 renamings to the renaming of all things German in World War I, but argued that the freedom fries episode was even worse <b>because</b> [...] "Germany, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> was America's enemy, whereas France is America's NATO ally." [...] The episode occurred {{despite the fact that}} neither french fries nor french toast are typically French (see origins of french fries and french toast), with American people and politicians being driven intentionally or unintentionally by the name confusion.|$|R
