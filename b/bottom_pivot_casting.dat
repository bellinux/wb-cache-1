50|$|Some motorcycles, {{such as the}} Yamaha TRX850, have hybrid frames {{that employ}} alloy {{castings}} at the swingarm pivot area. Another variation is to suspend the engine from a trellis frame, but have the swingarm <b>pivot</b> <b>cast</b> into {{the rear of the}} engine.|$|R
50|$|Inside, the lobby, reached {{through a}} long {{vestibule}} with bulletin boards, is minimally decorated. The mosaic tile floor is white with a green border. Above black marble baseboards, the walls have wooden wainscoting rising to a plaster cornice at the high ceiling. Two single-paned windows with top and <b>bottom</b> <b>pivots</b> are located just below the ceiling. There are two original wooden tables with glass tops.|$|R
50|$|Like the {{subsequent}} Classes 2E, 3E and 4E, the Class 1E had bogie mounted draft gear. It had a Bo+Bo wheel arrangement with an articulated inter-bogie linkage, therefore no train forces were transmitted {{directly to the}} locomotive body. The bogie pivot centres were 6604 mm apart. One of the <b>bottom</b> <b>pivot</b> centres was fixed while the other was free to move longitudinally to allow for any wear occurring in the articulated coupling between the two bogies.|$|R
50|$|The {{reversing}} {{and hand}} brake gear {{were provided with}} universal joints. The steam and exhaust pipes had ball-and-socket joints, with {{the centre of the}} ball coinciding with that of the spherical <b>pivot</b> <b>casting.</b> The exhaust of the inner cylinders on the front power unit passed to the smokebox via a similar ball-and-socket joint, installed close to the universal joint. The exhaust of the rear power unit's cylinders escaped through the auxiliary chimney in the coal bunker.|$|R
50|$|Their type H.T-1 {{mechanical}} stokers {{were capable}} of delivering 15000 lb of coal per hour, which ensured a high firing rate when required. The stoker was driven by a totally enclosed double-acting two-cylinder variable-speed reversing steam engine, located on the hind <b>pivot</b> <b>casting</b> and operated from the cab. The coal bunker on the rear engine unit's frame was designed with sloping sides to allow the coal to gravitate to the mechanical stoker's conveyor screw trough, which extended {{the full length of}} the bunker.|$|R
50|$|The bike had a {{prototype}} sprung frame built under the Bentley and Draper patents. The frame {{as far back}} as the gearbox bracket was normal K. Behind this however is a triangulated tubular swinging fork assembly worked in a trunnion bearing. From the rear fork-ends two seta-stays were pivoted and connected to the sprung part of the frame below the saddle by a system of links and spindles incorporating two coil springs. Friction dampers were fitted to these links and there were also two more at the <b>bottom</b> <b>pivots</b> at the fork-ends.|$|R

50|$|Each of {{the five}} stories had a central drive shaft, off of which pulleys were {{attached}} to power the machinery. The floors were supported by turned wood columns. The wooden window sashes pivoted such that the top third pivoted inward and the <b>bottom</b> two-thirds <b>pivoted</b> about its center {{so they could be}} left open even during rain. The new and old halves of the building were separated by firewalls and a central staircase and elevator.|$|R
5|$|Spotted eagle rays, {{in common}} with many other rays, often fall victim to sharks such as the tiger shark, the lemon shark, the bull shark, the silver tip shark, and the great hammerhead shark. A great hammerhead shark has been {{observed}} attacking a spotted eagle ray in open water by taking a large bite {{out of one of}} its pectoral fins, thus incapacitating the ray. The shark then used its head to pin the ray to the <b>bottom</b> and <b>pivoted</b> to take the ray in its jaws, head first. Sharks have also been observed to follow female rays during the birthing season, and feed on the newborn pups.|$|R
50|$|A pivot {{window is}} a window hung on one hinge on each of two {{opposite}} sides which allows the window to revolve when opened. The hinges may be mounted top and <b>bottom</b> (Vertically <b>Pivoted)</b> or at each jamb (Horizontally Pivoted). The window will usually open initially to a restricted position for ventilation and, once released, fully reverse and lock again for safe cleaning from inside. Modern pivot hinges incorporate a friction device to hold the window open against its own weight and may have restriction and reversed locking built in. In the UK, where this type of window is most common, they were extensively installed in high-rise social housing.|$|R

Internal parasites include the gnathostomatid nematode Echinocephalus sinensis in the spiral intestine. External parasites include the monocotylid monogeneans Decacotyle octona, Decacotyle elpora and Thaumatocotyle pseudodasybatis on the gills.|$|R
50|$|Each ISPR {{provides}} 1.571 m3 (55.5 ft3) {{of internal}} volume being about 2 m (79.3 in) high, 1.05 m (41.3 in) wide, and 85.9 cm (33.8 in) deep. The rack weighs 104 kg (230 lb) and can accommodate an additional 700 kg (1540 lb) of payload equipment. The rack has internal mounting provisions to allow attachment of secondary structure. The ISPRs will be {{outfitted with a}} thin center post to accommodate sub-rack-sized payloads, such as the 483 mm (19-inch rack) Spacelab Standard Interface Rack (SIR) Drawer or the Space Shuttle Middeck Locker. Utility pass-through ports are located on each side to allow cables to be run between Racks. Module attachment points are provided {{at the top of}} the rack and via pivot points at the <b>bottom.</b> The <b>pivot</b> points support installation and maintenance. Tracks on the exterior front posts allow mounting of payload equipment and laptop computers. Additional adapters on the ISPRs are provided for ground handling.|$|R
40|$|Bamboo {{traditional}} construction {{had been}} proved at home construction in Earthquake Zone where home construction with bamboo construction still stands on intact post earthquake whereas, many brick or concrete construction buildings destroy. Bamboo {{has some of}} weaknesses as building materials; physically {{it is difficult to}} be made mechanically because of dimensional variation and length difference in bamboo connections. Based on the statement above, it need to be designed an aid tool to clipped bamboo and make center line so that connection of cone bamboo will be made easier. This bamboo clip system used “ V “ form where the system was moved with handle and transmitted to ulir pivot by chain and cogwheel for bottom clip from up ulir <b>pivot</b> to <b>bottom</b> ulir <b>pivot.</b> The working of bamboo will be gripped both of center line. Based on the research that push force was 28 N/mm 2 to 65 N/mm 2 therefore, from the push force it designed grip aid tool to process the making of bamboo connections...|$|R
50|$|Another {{function}} of the cephalofoil is suggested by an observation of a great hammerhead attacking a southern stingray (Dasyatis americana) in the Bahamas: the shark first knocked the ray to the sea bottom with a powerful blow from above, and then pinned it with its head while pivoting to take a large bite from {{each side of the}} ray's pectoral fin disc. This effectively crippled the stingray, which was then picked up in the jaws and sawed apart with rapid shakes of the head. A great hammerhead has also been seen attacking a spotted eagle ray (Aetobatus narinari) in open water by taking a massive bite out of one of its pectoral fins. The ray thus incapacitated, the shark once again used its head to pin it to the <b>bottom</b> and <b>pivoted</b> to take the ray in its jaws head-first. These observations suggest that the great hammerhead seeks to disable rays with the first bite, a strategy {{similar to that of the}} great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), and that its cephalofoil is an adaptation for prey handling.|$|R
50|$|The Colman Building is a {{historic}} office building located in Seattle, Washington. It occupies a half of a block in downtown Seattle in proximity to Pioneer Square, bound by First Avenue, Marion and Columbia Streets. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places {{as well as being}} a City of Seattle landmark. The building was built in several stages with a change of design between 1889 and 1906. It was commissioned by Scottish immigrant and master machinist James Colman who arrived in Seattle in 1872. Architect Stephen Meany designed the original plans while the reconstruction that is visible today was designed by August Tidemand inspired by the Chicago School with less ornamentation and large <b>pivoting</b> windows. The <b>cast</b> iron elements from the original building remain on the first floor, while the second floor was rebuilt of rusticated stone. Four floors of red brick trimmed with marble were built on top of this. The building is crowned with a copper cornice.|$|R
5000|$|The {{works for}} the bridge at either river bank were of brick, masonry and {{concrete}} on 13 in square pitch pine piles. The remainder of the bridge foundations consisted of cast iron piers fitted with cutting shoes sunk by excavation by hand labour working in airlocks, and by weighting. Piers for the swing span consisted of eight cast iron cylinders tapering from 6 to 4.5 ft diameter from base to top which surrounded a ninth cylinder of 7 ft base diameter; the [...] wall width cylinders were sunk {{to the level of}} sandstone bedrock at a depth of around 78 ft; after which they were filled with concrete. The central river pier had similar foundations of two 8 ft cast iron piers braced together. The swing span turntable consisted of 29 ft diameter steel conical roller paths and bearings, supported on a circular 20 in deep box girder in eight sections, with a twelve section box girder above, supporting the superstructure. The bridge turned about a central heavy <b>cast</b> <b>pivot,</b> with ties to the upper and lower box girders, and to the bearings. The bridge superstructure was constructed of wrought iron plate girders, with an asymmetric 'hogback' shape; the swing span extremities were 45 and 85 ft from the centre line, with a 92.45 LT counterweight; the maximum web depth was 14.5 ft. The fixed span was of similar, but symmetrical construction. The bridge was turned by the reaction of a rotating vertical shaft on a rack on the lower roller path. Power was supplied hydraulically from an accumulator (charged by steam engine power) near the railway station, via underground concentric pressure and return pipes in the central swing span pier - driving a pair of three cylinder hydraulic engines located in the cabin. Accumulators and steam engines were duplicated. The locking mechanism for the bridge was also hydraulically powered. As a consequence of the realignment of track resulting from the resiting of the bridge the station at Selby was also partially reconstructed.|$|R
