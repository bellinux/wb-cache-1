50|$|The {{original}} LD process consisted in {{blowing oxygen}} {{over the top}} of the molten iron through the water-cooled nozzle of a vertical lance. In the 1960s steelmakers introduced <b>bottom-blown</b> <b>converters</b> and introduced inert gas blowing for stirring the molten metal and removing the phosphorus impurities.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Bottom-blown</b> Oxygen <b>Converter</b> or BBOCTM is a {{smelting}} furnace {{developed by the}} staff at Britannia Refined Metals Limited (“BRM”), a British subsidiary of MIM Holdings Limited (which {{is now part of}} the Glencore group of companies). The furnace is currently marketed by Glencore Technology. It is a sealed, flat-bottomed furnace mounted on a tilting frame that is used in the recovery of precious metals. A key feature is the use of a shrouded lance to inject oxygen through the bottom of the furnace, directly into the precious metals contained in the furnace, to oxidize base metals or other impurities as part of their removal as slag.|$|R
