5|$|After leaving West Ham, Greaves put {{on weight}} and did not attend a match as either a player or a spectator for two years. Drinking formed {{a large part of}} his life and he became an alcoholic; at times he was {{drinking}} 20 pints of lager during the day and consuming a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vodka</b> in the evening. He later admitted that he was also regularly driving whilst drunk during this period. Seeking an answer to his alcoholism, Greaves decided to return to football at a lower level where he would not be required to be as fit as he had been whilst playing in the Football League. He started playing for his local side, Brentwood, and made his debut on 27 December 1975 in a 2–0 defeat to Witham Town.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills walking {{around on a}} bridge, as she reminisces about her {{relationship}} with her boyfriend. As the song builds up to the first verse, they are depicted {{in the living room of}} a hazy-looking apartment, and Kills smiles at him, who kisses her. They start to involve physically, however he pushes her away and opts to smoke a cigar; Kills, simultaneously, takes several pills. As they start to hallucinate, images of dilated pupils appear quickly on the screen and they are shown on the same setting dressed formally. They leave the apartment and drive to a bar—still smoking—and as they reach there, Kills observes an empty stage and decides to sing there. She keeps hallucinating and sees herself in a golden dress as opposed to what she is actually dressing—a black T-shirt. As she continues to sing, a short-haired man who is watching her performance smiles at her and hits on her. Kills' on-screen boyfriend walks up to him and they start a fight while Kills sings. A few moments after, Kills—who was oblivious to the fight—tries to break them up but gets hit by her boyfriend, and leaves the bar crying. He pursues her and they both argue inside their car. They abruptly stop arguing and begin having sexual intercourse. As the song reaches its end, Kills and her boyfriend are again in their apartment, where she spills a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vodka</b> on the ground. After looking at him, she lights it which causes the apartment to burn.|$|E

500|$|Mark Dennis QC, for the prosecution, {{argued that}} Harwood's {{use of force}} against Tomlinson had been {{unnecessary}} and unreasonable, and had caused Tomlinson's death. He argued that a [...] "clear temporal link" [...] between the incident and Tomlinson's collapse had been provided by the Guardian video, that Tomlinson had posed no threat, and that the use of force had been a [...] "gratuitous act of aggression." [...] The defence argued that Tomlinson's health was relevant. The court heard that he had liver and brain disease caused by alcohol abuse, numbness in his legs and balance problems, and that he had been treated at least 20 times between 2007 and 2009, mostly at A departments, related to falling while drunk.

2500|$|Side Note: This joke is {{a play on}} {{the fact}} that in Russia it is {{believed}} that three is the optimal number of people for drinking. This in turn goes back to when in the Soviet Union a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vodka</b> cost 2.87 Soviet rubles, 3 rubles being a convenient price for three men to buy a bottle and have 13 kopecks left for a snack. The classic for the latter was a rectangular pack of soft processed cheese [...] "Druzhba" [...] (Friendship), with that exact price. Therefore, a natural company is 3, each contributing 1 ruble. This procedure was dubbed [...] "to have arranged for three (persons)" [...] ( [...] ; soobrazit' na troikh, literal translation: [...] "to have figured out for three"). Much of Soviet folklore is based on this interpretation of the [...] "magic of the number 3".|$|E
2500|$|On November 22, 2011, Toni Annette Medrano accidentally {{killed her}} 3-week-old son, Adrian Alexander Medrano, {{while she was}} {{sleeping}} {{on the couch with}} him.

The following morning, she woke up and found her infant son unresponsive and cold to the touch. While Grace was covering the case, she infamously dubbed Medrano [...] "Vodka Mom". During one of her shows, Grace brought a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vodka</b> onto her set and poured shots to demonstrate how much Medrano had drunk the night of her son's death. In June 2012, Medrano was charged with two counts of second-degree manslaughter. If convicted on both counts, Medrano would have faced a maximum of ten years in prison.|$|E
