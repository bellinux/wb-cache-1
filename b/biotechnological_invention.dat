Taking into account that this is a <b>biotechnological</b> <b>invention,</b> the key question that this paper highlights is the interpretation of the provisions of their patentability. Namely, thanks to the advanced methods of isolation, purification and preparation for implementation, modern patent systems do not exclude a priori living organisms from patent protection.

In {{this article}} the {{patentability}} of <b>biotechnological</b> <b>invention</b> is discussed focusing on some controversies still arising in that area. Beginning {{from a few}} landmark decisions permitting broad patenting of biotechnological inventions both in Europe and USA (albeit not issued concurrently) the answer for the patentability of living organisms has been made obvious. The assessment should no longer rely on the distinction that {{the subject matter of}} the invention is alive. The above has confirmed the biotechnology directive enacted in 1998. The directive should not be perceived as the sufficient tool for regulation of patentability of <b>biotechnological</b> <b>invention.</b> In the last ten years patent offices across the world are facing several important questions regarding more specific interpretation of the requirements of patentability in that context. The article shows how the concept of novelty, inventive step (non-obviousness) and industrial capability is understood in the field of biotechnology, with particular focus on gene patents. Also the line between invention and discovery is commented. As a separate issue, the exclusion from patentability due to contradiction with morality principles is briefly introduced.

40|$|Biotechnology {{either as}} a subject matter or {{invention}} and the act of patenting are relatively new to many developing countries. <b>Biotechnological</b> <b>invention</b> has limitless potentials. It is particularly important to pharmaceutical, medicinal, drug, chemicals, foods and agricultural industries worldwide. Developing countries {{could take advantage of}} the mandatory obligations of TRIPS as they have abundance of genetic resources. By supplying raw ingredients for biotechnology they may occupy the position of biotechnology producers globally.. This looks even brighter due to the current trend in patenting the same where the bar for non-obvious has been lowered drastically. This note explores on how the above current intellectual property trend and policy particularly in context of biotechnology law purportedly benefiting developing countries are putting constraints upon many of them instead. Firstly some background facts of TRIPS, which governs patent and is binding upon every country member domestically are presented. It then briefly explains biotechnology invention, the basic patentability requirements and the new trend of judicial courts in developed nations in interpreting the non-obvious requirement and reasons for doing so. Finally, the study will examine the disabilities of developing countries in overcoming even the much lowered standard of non-obvious requirement. This paper also points out that there are still many major tasks undone at national level which are hampering them from producing their first <b>biotechnological</b> <b>invention</b> or becoming active biotechnological producer...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePlant {{innovation}} is expensive. It is therefore crucial {{to protect the}} intellectual property of the breeder as all plant varieties are living self-reproducible material. Intellectual property protection of plant innovation varies from country to country. Plant varieties are not patentable in Europe. Protection of biotechnological inventions is obtained by patent if the invention is new, has an inventive step and industrial applicability. The protection conferred by a patent to a <b>biotechnological</b> <b>invention</b> also applies to varieties {{in which it is}} inserted, namely transgenic varieties. In Europe the exceptions to the protection of conventional and transgenic varieties are the same, namely, under certain conditions, the possibility of using farm-saved seeds and access to the genetic diversity of the protected variety for breeding. The possibilities of protection depend on national laws and examples of various countries including developing countries growing transgenic varieties are presented...|$|E

The chapter is divided into three parts - international, European and national sources. Discussion regarding European sources is split into two subsections dealing with EPC and EU law. The author examines in particular the complicated legislative procedure for the adoption of the Directive 98 / 44 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 6 th July 1998 on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions and its impact on European patent law.

40|$|In recent years, the {{biotechnology}} industry has surpassed a market worth of 200 billion dollars, with over 1. 4 million jobs dependent on that market. However, the {{biotechnology industry}} is also uniquely {{dependent on the}} patent system to protect the huge investments {{of time and money}} required to bring new research to the market. Increasingly, courts have improperly used the Patent Act 2 ̆ 7 s Section 101 subject matter eligibility requirement as a functional barrier for new biotechnological patents, creating substantial uncertainty in the validity of many patents. In particular, the courts have utilized judicially created exceptions to allowable subject matter [...] laws of nature, natural phenomenon, and abstract ideas [...] to invalidate a wide variety of biotechnology patents. This improper use has resulted in a tangled and confusing body of law, and a merging of Section 101 subject matter eligibility and Section 103 obviousness requirements for a valid patent. Recently, the Federal Circuit has begun to push back against this improper use, providing limiting principals in the use of Section 101 and the judicial exceptions. Instead of using Section 101 as a new functional barrier to patent validity, the Federal Circuit has properly delineated between the subject matter eligibility and obviousness requirements. This allows for more predicability in the validity of patents, and clarity for those seeking to patent a new <b>biotechnological</b> <b>invention...</b>|$|E
40|$|Arguably, {{no other}} <b>biotechnological</b> <b>invention</b> has been excoriated {{with so much}} {{confused}} rhetoric on “utility” as the invention relating to Genetic Use Restriction Technologies (“GURTs”) patented in the United States, Canada, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark and many other countries. Otherwise known by their rather inflammatory nickname of both “terminator patents,” GURTs have become the lightning rod for both technophiles and Luddites. At {{the heart of the}} controversy is a misunderstanding of the changed meaning of the concept of utility in patent law. This paper argues that while the public understanding of utility as social usefulness is well grounded in history of patent law, modern development in the jurisprudence of utility has not been stagnant. To the contrary, utility in patent has moved from puritanical notions to its current articulation as the ability of an invention to do what it promises to do as per the disclosure filed with the patent office. In other words, the test of utility is no longer anchored on whether the alleged invention is socially useful or ethically permissible. Rather, the overriding criterion in modern patent law is whether the alleged invention performs or fulfills what it predicts to do as per its disclosure. In order to appreciate this shift, it has to be born in mind that across the centuries, courts in various jurisdictions have evolved in their conception of what utility means in patent law. From an original focus on social usefulness with a puritanical slant, utility has moved to a struggle between social usefulness and mechanical operability and now to mechanical predictability. Consequently, this paper argues that a fundamental misconception on the recent criticisms against the utility or otherwise of “terminator” technologies is that utility is mistaken for its original notion of social usefulness. The present reality is that utility of inventions has weaned itself from the high-minded impulses of the Venetian patent system and the British Statute of Monopolies...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the current legal protection for agricultural <b>biotechnological</b> <b>inventions</b> in Europe and the U. S. It has been a subject of debate whether plants and agricultural <b>biotechnological</b> <b>inventions</b> which includes plants, transgenic plants and plant varieties, can {{be the subject of}} patent protection, in addition to or {{as an alternative to the}} protection afforded by plant variety rights. Biotechnological patents have been criticized for granting an excessive scope of protection to proprietors, whereas plant variety rights have been slighted for not providing enough protection. Hence, this research is built on a few main themes, namely; the discussion of IP protection for agricultural <b>biotechnological</b> <b>inventions</b> as currently in practice in Europe and the U. S., as well as the deliberation on the current system as practised in Malaysia. The research also discusses the issue of the interface between the patent regime and plant variety rights over agricultural <b>biotechnological</b> <b>inventions</b> as there are possible overlaps between the two systems, notwithstanding the exclusivity of protection of plant varieties under the PVR system. The research looks at the prospect for Malaysia as a developing country to enhance its current IP framework and legislation in order to develop its agricultural biotechnology industry. Hence, it focuses on whether there is a single system as a model of IP regime to be adopted by Malaysia in order to provide the best IP protection for its agricultural biotechnology industry. The comparative approach is inevitable, in referring to the European model and the American model as a guide. The relevant factors such as the different setting, society and economic strength are given due consideration in coming up with the proposal to amend the current intellectual property law and legal system in Malaysia.

40|$|In {{order to}} take ethical {{considerations}} of patenting biological material into account, the so-called ‘‘ordre public or morality clause’’ was implemented as Article 6 in the EC directive on the legal protection of <b>biotechnological</b> <b>inventions,</b> 98 / 44 /EC. At first glance, this seems to provide a significant advantage to the European patent system with respect to ethics. The thesis of this paper argues that the ordre public or morality clause does not provide sufficient protection against ethically problematic uses of the patent system within the area of life. On the contrary, there are worrisome obstacles to any effective and comprehensive critical analysis of the ethical aspects of bio-patenting, especially {{in the field of}} agriculture. These obstacles can be seen as indirect consequences of the implementation of ethical considerations in form of the ordre public and morality clause in the EC Directive. Therefore, Article 6 of the EC Directive on the legal protection of <b>biotechnological</b> <b>inventions</b> seems to ultimately weaken the position of ethics in the debate concerning bio-patenting because the ordre public and morality clause is usually interpreted in an exclusively bio-ethical way in the sense of an ‘‘intrinsic ethics,’’ which is primarily interested in questions regarding the moral status of particular entities. It is argued that an important cause of this phenomenon is that the decisive reasons against bio-patenting are concerns of social ethics, and not bio-ethics...|$|R

50|$|While some {{feel that}} a patent on living {{material}} is unethical, others believe that not allowing patents on <b>biotechnological</b> <b>inventions</b> would also be unethical.

40|$|The European Parliament {{rejected}} in 1995 the European Commission proposal to harmo-nize legal protection of <b>biotechnological</b> <b>inventions.</b> Although {{it did not}} seem initially the most contentious of the many issues involved in the current legal and ethical debate around biomedicine and genetics, patenting is now focusing bioethics in Europe. Key words: bioethics, European Community, human genetics, patenting. Among its efforts to achieve a common market in Europe, the European Commission (EC) proposed in 1988 an initiative to harmonize the legal protection of <b>biotechnological</b> <b>inventions</b> (EC, 1989, pp. 3 ff). Surprising-ly, one decade later, the patenting issue still seems to be the main stum-bling block for the bioethics debate in the European institutions. In fact, the initial proposal adopted by the EC in late 1988 (and then presented to the Council of Ministers, which was the real decision-maker for an inter-nal market in the legal system of the European Community, and published in the Official Journal early in 1989) did not raise in new terms the general issue of the patentability of living matter. As early as 1843 the first known patent for a living organism was granted in Finland, and Louis Pasteur obtained a U. S. patent for a yeast free from organic germs of disease in 1873. Since the Diamond v. Chakrabarty ruling (447 U. S. 303), most Patent Offices have gone beyond the issue of whether living matter is patentable.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{intellectual}} property in the legal systems of individual states is constantly expanded, also because of accession to international conventions, treaties and agreements. Primarily however, the subject scope increases steadily as {{a growing number of}} so-called intellectual subjects achieve the status of non-material property, to which exclusive rights apply. The exclusive right to a plant variety, regulated by the Law of June 26, 2003 on the legal protection of plant varieties, on grounds of a model laid down in the International UPOV Convention, is regarded an industrial property law. The breeder’s right should thus be considered a neighbouring right or one related to the rights gathered under the collective title of industrial property. The WTO/TRIPS Agreement creates an international standard of protection for plant varieties, obligating states to protect plant varieties by patents, sui generis rights or a combination of the two. The prohibition of patenting plant and animal varieties within the European Patent Convention, directive 98 / 44 /EC on the legal protection of <b>biotechnological</b> <b>inventions</b> and domestic legislation on protection of industrial property – do not mean that the exclusion refers to plants and animals per se. Exclusion from patenting does not concern microbiological cultivation nor the effects of this which allows patent protection of inventions from the sphere of biotechnology (<b>biotechnological</b> <b>inventions).</b> It appears that the decisive factor, significant for the further development of exclusive rights to variety, is the extent of protection awarded to its cultivator, which at the same time will condition the legal situation of the variety’s user (land possessor) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{accumulated}} {{importance of}} the patent law morality exclusion over the recent decades has been prompted by the increased protection sought for <b>biotechnological</b> <b>inventions.</b> This raises specific ethical concerns such as the respect for human dignity. The morality exclusion is regarded as an indispensable safeguard in the patent system of the 21 st century, but its application and scope remains unclear, not least due to a division of competence between the European Union (EU), the European Patent Organisation and national Member States. In addition, the international Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) {{under the auspices of}} the World Trade Organization (WTO) sets minimum standards for the operation of the morality exclusion. In this study the scope, interpretation and application of the morality exclusion in European and international patent law is described and analysed by applying the legal dogmatic method. The object of study is the European patent law morality exclusion in terms of Article 53 (a) and Rule 28 of the European Patent Convention and Article 6 of Directive 98 / 44 /EC on the legal protection of <b>biotechnological</b> <b>inventions.</b> A connected purpose of this study is to describe, problematize and analyse the compliance by the regional rules (EU, European Patent Organisation) with the international framework provided by Article 27. 2 of the TRIPS Agreement. Although this study is not limited to specific technologies, the majority of issues raised are done so in relation to the morality exclusion concerning <b>biotechnological</b> <b>inventions,</b> which is reflected in this work. Furthermore, the theoretical framework is dependent on the functioning of the morality exclusion in the respective systems, both regional (EU, European Patent Organisation) and international (WTO). This approach necessitates a consideration of the characteristics of each legal system. This thesis uncovers the differences in the interpretation of the morality exclusion (both within as well as between the legal systems), which causes legal uncertainty in this particularly complex field where patent law and ethics interact. The effects of such variations on the scope and application of the morality exclusion are clarified and critically reviewed. According to the wording of the morality exclusion, the commercial exploitation of an invention with regard to morality or ordre public is a central prerequisite in the assessment of excluded subject matter. Consequently, the interpretation of this particular requirement is subject to critical review, since its implications are decisive for the scope of application of the morality exclusion. It is furthermore questioned whether the European morality exclusions are TRIPS-compliant, and the possible effects (and available remedies) of non-compliance for the EU legal order are analysed. This in turn involves issues of norm conflicts in international and EU law. The author presents a critical analysis, investigates the interaction between legal systems and suggests clarifications in order to attain the optimal functioning of the morality exclusion...|$|R
