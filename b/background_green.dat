2500|$|This {{underground}} station, {{opened on}} August 19, 1933, has one island platform between two tracks.

2500|$|The {{distinctive}} [...] "Lex" [...] mosaics were preserved {{during the}} renovation, by installing pre-arranged blocks along the station wall that cup the Lexington Avenue Line above it. The wall tiles have the red [...] "Lex" [...] evenly spaced out, {{similar to the}} IND style, with blue <b>background,</b> <b>green</b> borders, and white lettering. In 2002, the station received a major overhaul. It has received a state of repairs as well as upgraded the station for ADA compliance and restoring the original late 1910s tiling. The MTA repaired the staircases, re-tiling for the walls, new tiling on the floors, upgrading the station's lights and the public address system, installing ADA yellow safety threads along the platform edge, new signs, and new trackbeds in both directions. The station could not be made ADA-compliant to install elevators on the platform, because the platform columns on the Lexington Avenue side make the platform too narrow for a wheelchair to navigate.|$|E

There is usually a small spot of bright yellow {{at the corners of}} the mouth.|$|E
5000|$|Motor Cycling {{was one of}} {{the first}} British {{motorcycle}} magazines. Launched in 1910, the front covers often had varying degree of green <b>background,</b> <b>green</b> or contrasting text and B&W illustrations or photographic images. This common theme resulted in almost a 'trademark' appearance, being called [...] "The Green 'un", distinguishing it from its rival publication The Motor Cycle which had variation on blue background colouring with contrasting text and images ("The Blue 'un").|$|E

5000|$|A subdued grey-beige tint {{replaced}} the yellow-ochre colour. On {{top of this}} <b>background,</b> <b>green</b> and brown irregular patterns were screen-printed. A final innovation applied to this camouflage colour printing were the [...] "splinters" [...] irregularly printed on the fabric. Directional, dark-green dashed lines ("grass" [...] or [...] "rain") were printed in selected areas to help break up the silhouette. Many similar rain pattern designs inspired by splittermuster were made after the war by Warsaw Pact countries. During the war, cost-saving measures required textiles to be printed with changed colours {{and many of the}} lower-cost two-colour options were abandoned. These cost-saving measures caused significant deviations from the original colour patterns. In 1941 splitter pattern jump smocks were issued to German paratroops for the invasion of Crete.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect is}} {{inducted}} {{by looking at}} a test image similar to that below. It contains oppositely oriented gratings of lines, horizontal and vertical. Next, the subject stares alternately at two induction images {{similar to the ones}} directly beneath the top image. One image should show one orientation of grating (here horizontal) with a colored background (red) and the other should show the other orientation of grating (here vertical) with a different, preferably oppositely colored <b>background</b> (<b>green).</b> Each image should be gazed at by the subject for several seconds at a time, and the two images should be gazed at for a total of several minutes for the effect to become visible. The subject should stare approximately at the center of each image, allowing the eyes to move around a little. After several minutes, the subject should look back to the test image; the gratings should appear tinted by the opposite color to that of the induction gratings (i.e., horizontal should appear greenish and vertical pinkish).|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} novel {{inversion}} algorithm to image buried objects in inhomogeneous media from the electromagnetic {{data on the}} outer boundary. Our method is based on exploiting the Cauchy data to derive a new Born-like linearization of the inverse problem. The main advantage of this formulation is to avoid {{the use of the}} <b>background</b> <b>Green</b> function and therefore is computationally more efficient. It also provides better accuracy than classical Born approximation. In the case of stratified media, our approach can be coupled with any appropriate continuation method. We discuss here the coupling with a continuation method based on the use of approximate transmission conditions. The feasibility and robustness of our methodology is validated through numerical experiments for single and multiple targets...|$|E

Few studies, however, examine {{whether this is}} the case for walking and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). We investigated to what extent neighbourhood green space was associated with weekly participation and frequency of walking and MVPA in a large cross-sectional survey of Australian adults 45  years and older. Methods Logit and negative binomial regression were used to estimate the degree of association between walking, MVPA and neighbourhood green space in a sample of 203   883 adults from the Australian 45 and Up Study. Walking and MVPA were measured using the Active Australia Survey. Green space was measured {{as a percentage of the}} total land-use within 1  km radius of residence.
