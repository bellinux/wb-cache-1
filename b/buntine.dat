Another long-serving master {{of the first half}} of the 20th Century was Colonel Albert Douglas Arthur (1889-1949). In 1951 the college library was housed in a new room and renamed the A.D. Arthur Memorial Library in his honour. The library moved into the Nesbitt Wing upon its completion and when it moved again into Prescott Hall an adjoining study room was named the A.D. Arthur Annex. Arthur's name has not been connected with the college library since the 1970s but his portrait in oils still hangs in the Ben Jarvie Common Room. In 2014, past masters Phil Davis OAM and Robert <b>Buntine</b> were honoured with rooms in the AJ Rae Resource and Library Centre being named after them. Davis is the college's third-longest serving master (1951–2000), after Cortis Jones and Jarvie, and <b>Buntine</b> was the Deputy Headmaster during the headship of Tony Rae.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAbsorption {{is one of}} the {{so-called}} inverse resolution operators of Inductive Logic Programming. The paper studies the properties of absorption that make it suitable for incremental generalization of definite clauses using background knowledge represented by a definite program. The soundness and completeness of the operator are established according to <b>Buntine's</b> model of generalization called generalized subsumption. The completeness argument proceeds by viewing absorption as the inversion of SLD-resolution. In addition, some simplifying techniques are introduced for reducing the non-determinism inherent in usual presentations of absorption. The effect of these simplifications on completeness is discussed...|$|R

We adopt script A signℒ-log, {{a language that}} combines the function-free Horn clausal language DATALOG and the description logic script A signℒscript C sign by using concept assertions as type constraints on variables. For constrained DATALOG clauses we define a relation of subsumption, called B-subsumption, inspired by <b>Buntine's</b> generalized subsumption. We show that B-subsumption induces a quasi-order, denoted as ≥B, over the space of constrained DATALOG clauses and provide a procedure for checking ≥B under the object identity bias...|$|R
