It {{could also result in}} a {{decrease}} in the output of the Montour Power Plant, causing a <b>brownout</b> in the area. A severe failure of the dam is considered by the Multi-jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan to be the most dangerous threat to Montour County.|$|E

2500|$|On 8 April 2010, a USAF CV-22 {{crashed in}} {{southern}} Afghanistan. Three US service members and one civilian {{were killed and}} 16 injured in the crash. [...] Initially it was unclear if the accident was caused by enemy fire. [...] The loaded CV-22B was at its hovering capability limit, landing at night near Qalat (altitude approx. 5,000 feet) in <b>brownout</b> conditions, in turbulence due to the location in a gully. [...] The USAF investigation ruled out <b>brownout</b> conditions, enemy fire, and vortex ring state as causes. [...] The investigation found several factors that significantly contributed to the crash; these include low visibility, a poorly executed approach, loss of situational awareness, and a high descent rate.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>brownout</b> is {{a drop in}} voltage in an {{electrical}} power supply. The term <b>brownout</b> comes from the dimming experienced by lighting when the voltage sags. Brownouts can cause poor performance of equipment or even incorrect operation.|$|E
25|$|The daily <b>brownouts</b> {{that plagued}} the economy were also {{addressed}} through {{the enactment of}} policies that placed guaranteed rates. The economy {{during the first year}} of Ramos administration suffered from severe power shortage, with frequent <b>brownouts,</b> each lasting from 8 to 12 hours. To resolve this problem, the Electric Power Crisis Act was made into law together with the Build-Operate-Transfer Law. Twenty power plants were built because of these, and in effect, the administration was able to eliminate the power shortage problems in December 1993 and sustained economic growth for some time.|$|R

Data compiled by POGO from government sources show the Chinook flew 7 percent of all U.S. Army helicopter flight hours between 2003 and 2005 but accounted for 30 percent of all brownout-related accidents.|$|E

50|$|Through the 1970s to the 1990s, {{growing demand}} led to {{increasing}} numbers of power stations. In some areas, supply of electricity, especially at peak times, could {{not keep up with}} this demand, resulting in poor power quality including blackouts, power cuts, and <b>brownouts.</b> Increasingly, electricity was depended on for industry, heating, communication, lighting, and entertainment, and consumers demanded ever higher levels of reliability.|$|R

50|$|In aviation, a <b>brownout</b> (or brown-out) is an {{in-flight}} visibility restriction due to dust or {{sand in the}} air.In a <b>brownout,</b> {{the pilot}} cannot see nearby objects which provide the outside visual references necessary to control the aircraft near the ground. This can cause spatial disorientation and loss of situational awareness leading to an accident. Pilots have compared landing during brownouts to parallel parking an automobile with one's eyes closed.|$|E
50|$|Helicopter <b>brownout</b> is a US$100 {{million per}} year problem for the U.S. Military in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Army cites <b>brownout</b> in three {{out of every four}} {{helicopter}} accidents there.Brownout accidents occur close to the ground and at low airspeed, giving these accidents a higher survivability than other types. However, there have been deaths in military accidents in Iraq and Afghanistan, and nearly all of those were preventable.|$|E
