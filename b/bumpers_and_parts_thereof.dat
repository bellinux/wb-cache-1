30|$|Based on the {{findings}} of the study, bilateral trade agreement is able to expand the export of the Philippines with its trade partner, Japan. Based on the export data of Philippine export to Japan, there are certain commodities that were initially decreasing prior to the agreement that significantly increased, 7  years since the implementation of the agreement such as: meat and edible meat offal (15, 3312.2 %), umbrellas, sun umbrellas, walking-sticks, whips, riding-crops <b>and</b> <b>parts</b> <b>thereof</b> (1878.1 %), explosives; pyrotechnic products, matches, pyrophoric alloys, certain combustible preparations (1091.7 %).

It is further recommended to pursue assessment of other trade agreements undertaken by the Philippines to support this conclusion.|$|R
