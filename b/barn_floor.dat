2500|$|... "Winnow": The {{winnowing}} {{process is}} performed by throwing up the grain, after being trodden down, {{against the wind}} with a shovel. The threshing-floor, which was commonly on the harvest-field, was carefully leveled with a large cylindric roller and consolidated with chalk, that weeds might not spring up, and {{that it might not}} chop with drought. The farmer usually remained all night in harvest-time on the threshing-floor, not only for the protection of his valuable grain, but for the winnowing. That operation was performed in the evening to catch the breezes which blow after the close of a hot day, and which continue for the most part of the night. This duty at so important a season the master undertakes himself; and, accordingly, in the simplicity of ancient manners, Boaz, a person of considerable wealth and high rank, laid himself down to sleep on the <b>barn</b> <b>floor,</b> {{at the end of the}} heap of barley he had been winnowing.|$|E

60|$|Equal grumbling heralded the {{introduction}} of a threshing-machine, which Captain Carbonel purchased after long consideration. The beat of the flail on <b>barn</b> <b>floors</b> was a regular winter sound at Uphill, as in all the country round, but to get all the corn threshed and winnowed by a curious revolving fan with four canvas sails, was a troublesome affair, making farmers behindhand in coming to the market. And as soon as he could afford the venture the Captain obtained a machine to be worked by horse-power, for steam had hardly been brought as yet into use even for sea traffic, and the first railway was only opened late in 1830, the time of the accession of William the Fourth.|$|R

40|$|The pig's hoof is {{characterized}} by sudden changes between hard and soft horn and a high growth rate of the horn wall.

Some hoof alterations are described, the question of poor footing is discussed. The author provides recommendations regarding the recognition of inadequate <b>barn</b> <b>floors</b> and their improvement. Stable claws develop in animals housed on floors with soft surfaces or under restricted movement. Hoof cracks or soft heel ulcers are frequently seen in animals housed on rough and abrasive floors. Slatted floors with wide gaps and sharp edges cause a high rate of lesions at the coronary border.

40|$|A {{survey of}} 715 Holstein dairy farms in Pennsylvania {{was used to}} {{construct}} demographics for the average Holstein dairy farm. The average Holstein dairy farm was composed of 69 lactating cows; 11 nonlactating, pregnant cows; 44 heifers; and 18 calves. Milk production averaged 27. 3 kg (60. 0 lb). Crop area averaged 73. 6 ha. Milk production, crop area and type, average county yields, and herd animal groups were used to construct a typical feeding program for these farms. Typical rations were constructed for six feeding groups (three milk production groups, one nonlactating group, two heifer groups) to meet milk production, pregnancy, and growth requirements. Rations were constructed based on three forage qualities (excellent, average, and poor) typically observed on Pennsylvania dairy farms. Data for animal description (milk production, body weight, growth, and pregnancy status) and ration components and amounts consumed for each animal group were input into the excretion model of the Dairy Nutrient Planner computer program (DNP). Excretion of fecal N and dry matter (DM), urinary N, and total P and K were produced for each animal group and used to assess potential volatile losses of N. Work at the Marshak Dairy, New Bolton Center, indicates the majority of urinary N is rapidly lost as ammonia from dairy facilities. Based on this observation, the losses of N as ammonia were estimated to be 4. 63, 4. 62, and 4. 28 tonne/year for the farm with excellent, average, and poor quality forages, respectively. Volatile losses of N may be reduced most by controlling levels of urea in urine. Urinary N may be reduced through dietary manipulation of protein and carbohydrate sources. Conversion of urea to ammonia may be reduced by altering the pH of <b>barn</b> <b>floors</b> and gutters. Entrapment of ammonia may be accomplished by acidification of manure slurry. Atmospheric ammonia contributes to acid rain, eutrophication of estuaries and lakes, and particulate air pollution. Reduction of ammonia emissions from dairy barns can significantly reduce atmospheric pollution and improve air and water quality...|$|R

40|$|Assessment {{and control}} of {{environment}} and thus animal comfort in production confinement is typically based on predetermined ambient temperature levels. This traditional approach often falls short in meeting the animals’ true thermal need {{because it does not}} integrate the effects of other contributing factors, such as drafts, humidity (particularly in hot conditions), radiation (in poorly insulated <b>barns),</b> <b>floor</b> type and/or condition (dry vs. wet), nutritional plane and health status of the animal. Singular and certain combined effects of physical and nutritional factors on swine have been researched and documented quite extensively over the years (Boon, 1981, 1982; Brody, 1945; Bruce and Clark, 1979; Close, 1981; DeShazer and Overhults, 1982; Hahn et al., 1987; Le Dividich, 1982; Mount et al., 1968, 1975; Riskowski et al., 1990; Sallvik, 1984; Ye and Xin, 2000; Xin and DeShazer, 1991; Xin et al., 1999, 2000). Yet it is formidable to measure all influencing factors to produce a comprehensive thermal comfort index for assessment and control. The best indicator of the environment adequacy and thus animal comfort is animals themselves that integrate both external and internal factors, which in turn lead to distinctive resting behaviors. Huddling, resting next to one another, and spreading are the stereotypical postural patterns of animals that experience cold, comfortable, and warm/hot sensation, respectively. Dedicated animal caretakers often use such behavioral patterns to fine-tune the ideal air temperature settings. However, it is laborious and impractical for the caretakers to perform such manual adjustments on a continual and consistent basis. Computer vision offers a potential alternative to replace human observation of the animals and adjustment of control set-point. Previous work has examined feasibility and technical aspects of such an approach for assessment of thermal comfort based on image analysis of resting behavior of group-housed pigs (Geer et al., 1991; Hu and Xin, 2000; Shao, 1997; Shao et al., 1997, 1998). Though positive and promising, the results and data processing methods were limited to static conditions. For such an approach to be ultimately applicable to production conditions, it must be implemented on a real-time basis. Therefore, the objective of this endeavor was to explore a realtime computer vision system that allows continuous assessment {{and control of}} thermal comfort of group-housed pigs based on their resting patterns...|$|R
