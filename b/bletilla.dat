50|$|They {{have a great}} {{reputation}} of being the absolute easiest orchid for a beginner to grow. Unlike most tropical epiphytic orchids, this plant comes from somewhat temperate zones and grows in soil rather than on trees and require no extraordinary care to grow successfully. They prefer well drained evenly moist soils that are high in organic material and that never dry out nor remain sodden. They are sympodial growers and will form handsome clumps {{in only a few}} years. Other species and hybrids are occasionally available, the most common being B. striata var. alba, a white variation of the rose-mauve B. striata. <b>Bletilla</b> ochracea, a somewhat rare species from China has unusual flowers with yellow sepals and petals with a red-marked white lip and is becoming more available to collectors. <b>Bletilla</b> Penway Dragon (formosana × szetschuaunica) appears {{to be one of the}} exciting new hybrid grex if it becomes more available.|$|E

It {{is better to}} keep them in pots of well drained media so that water does not sit around the roots during winter when the plants are not actively growing.

50|$|<b>Bletilla</b> striata is {{the most}} common form found in the nursery trade and is often labeled simply as 'Hardy Orchid' or 'Chinese Ground Orchid' and is quite inexpensive. This {{beautiful}} and hardy deciduous orchid has the distinction of being one of the first orchids in cultivation in England dating from around 1794. The very flat knob-like tuberous root system is typically sympodial, expansive and each shoot is of annual duration only. On established plants, almost every new growth shoot has a flower spike before leaves fully develop. Each shoot can have up to fourteen beautiful rose-mauve flowers with a ruffled lip about 30mm diameter, scentless and looking something like a miniature Cattleya orchid flower. An established clump can have literally dozens of flower spikes flowering in the late Spring and the clumps only increase in beauty with time. They rarely exceed two feet in height.|$|E

Tumor volume (V 2) was assessed by MRI (on day 13 after treatment) and the tumor growth ratio (V 2 /V 1) was calculated. RESULTS: The mean tumor volume before (V 1) and after (V 2) treatment was 0. 0355 cm 3 and 0. 2248 cm 3 in group A, 0. 0374 cm 3 and 0. 0573 cm 3 in group B, 0. 0380 cm 3 and 0. 3674 cm 3 in group C, respectively.

40|$|We have {{prepared}} Chinese traditional herb <b>Bletilla</b> striata into microspheres as a novel embolic agent for decades. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the biocompatibility of <b>Bletilla</b> striata microspheres (BSMs). After a thermal test of BSMs in vitro, the cell biocompatibility of BSMs was investigated in mouse fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells using the methyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. In addition, blood biocompatibility was evaluated. In vivo intramuscular implantation and renal artery embolization in rabbits with BSMs were used to examine the inflammatory response. The experimental rabbits did not develop any fever symptoms after injection of BSMs, and BSMs exhibited no cytotoxicity in cultured mouse fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Additionally, BSMs exhibited high compatibility with red blood cells and no hemolysis activity. Intramuscular implantation with BSMs resulted in a gradually lessened mild inflammatory reaction that disappeared after eight weeks. The occlusion of small renal vessels was associated with a mild perivascular inflammatory reaction without significant renal and liver function damage. In conclusion, we believe that BSMs exhibit high biocompatibility and are a promising embolic agent...|$|E

40|$|Background: Polysaccharide {{isolated}} from <b>Bletilla</b> striata, a well known traditional Chinese medicine (<b>Bletilla</b> striata polysaccharide [BSP]) {{has been found}} to play important roles in endothelial cells proliferation, inducible nitric oxide stimulation, wound healing acceleration and other processes. Recent studies found that B. striata has anti oxidative properties, however, potential anti aging effects of BSP in whole organisms has not been characterized. Objective: To investigate whether BSP has anti aging effects on Caenorhabditis elegans. Materials and Methods: After treatment with BSP, the lifespan, locomotion ability, and stress resistance of C. elegans was determined. To provide insight into the underlying mechanism for the anti aging effect of BSP, we measured its effect on bacterial growth, brood size of C. elegans, and the insulin/insulin like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway. Results: After BSP treatment, the lifespan of C. elegans was extended, and its locomotion ability and stress resistance were increased. BSP was found to have no effect on bacterial growth or on reproduction of C. elegans, However, mRNA levels of age- 1 and hcf- 1 were reduced after BSP treatment. Additionally, we observed that BSP did not extend the lifespan of daf 16 mutant animals. Conclusion: BSP produces an anti aging effect on C. elegans through the insulin/IGF signaling pathway and holds promise for future development as a functional food...|$|E

40|$|Interspecific {{hybridization}} is {{a common}} method in orchids breeding, because many orchids have highly interspecific crossability. We succeeded to establish interspecific <b>Bletilla</b> hybrids. Although the elite hybrid obtained could propagate vegetatively in vitro, somaclonal variation {{is a big problem}} in micropropagation. Seedlings are alternative choice to avoid somaclonal variation but not practical for hybrid cultivars. Establishment of seedling cultivars is expected to provide more advantageous plantlets production. To establish seedling cultivars, use of haploid plant is one of the excellent methods. In seedling varieties, some risks i. e., viral disease, somaclonal mutation, and lower multiplication rate will be reduced. In this study, we investigated to induce haploid and dihaploid plants from female gametes by Naphthalene acetic acid sodium salt (NAA-Na) treatment in diploid <b>Bletilla</b> Briganthes and tetraploid Phalaenopsis, respectively. Unfertilized capsules were produced by treatment of the 2 % (w/v) NAA lanoline paste or NAA-Na solution on stigma. Although seeds number harvested was a few, the seeds were cultured on Hyponex medium, containing 3 gL– 1 Hyponex (6. 5 - 6 - 19), 20 gL– 1 sucrose and 10 gL– 1 agar or on NPCW medium containing 20 gL– 1 sucrose and 10 gL– 1 agar aseptically. In diploid Ble. Brigantes, some seeds developed into seedlings and the ploidy levels were haploid and diploid (doubled haploid). The seedlings acclimatized successfully were all doubled haploid, raised, and flowered. These NAA-Na induced plants produced fertile seeds of both self and cross fertilization. In tetraploid Phalaenopsis, the ploidy levels of seedlings which germinated from NAA-Na induced seeds were dihaploid only.

In this study, silymarin was encapsulated in self-assembled nanoparticles of <b>Bletilla</b> striata polysaccharide (BSP) conjugates modified with stearic acid and the physicochemical properties of the obtained nanoparticles were characterized. The silymarin-loaded micelles appeared as spherical particles with a mean diameter of 200 nm under TEM.

However, no detailed studies on its hemostatic approach have been performed. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the hemostatic effects of B. striata Micron Particles (BSMPs) and their hemostatic mechanisms.

In vitro coagulation studies revealed BSMP-blood aggregate formation via stereoscope and texture analyzers. In vivo studies based on rat injury model illustrated the BSMP capabilities under conditions of hemostasis. Compared to other BSMPs of different size ranges, BSMPs of 350 – 250 [*]μm are most efficient in hemostasis. As powder sizes decrease, the degree of aggregation between particles and hemostatic BSMP effects declines. The BSMP in contact with a bleeding surface locally forms a visible particle/blood aggregate as a physical barrier that facilitates hemostasis.

Mixed polymer formulations like chitosan-sodium alginate, sodium alginate-calcium alginate and chitosan-sodium alginate-calcium alginate were prepared and coated separately on cotton gauze surface using pad-dry-cure method. The herbal extract of <b>Bletilla</b> striata was immobilized on the polymer coated fabrics to increase the rate of wound healing.

Animal model was used to reveal the wound closure effect of the prepared specimens. A novel design of various polymer coated cotton gauze fabric for wound healing with antimicrobial activity was developed using 40 s Ne yarn.
