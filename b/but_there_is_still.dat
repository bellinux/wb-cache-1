5|$|Although the Eskaya {{had been}} known to {{people living in the}} {{vicinity}} of Bohol’s southeast highlands prior to World War II, {{it was only in the}} early 1980s that they came to wider public attention when government agricultural advisers toured the province to introduce Green Revolution policies.

25|$|Mechanical fiber splices are {{designed}} to be quicker and easier to install, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> the need for stripping, careful cleaning and precision cleaving. The fiber ends are aligned and held together by a precision-made sleeve, often using a clear index-matching gel that enhances the transmission of light across the joint. Such joints typically have higher optical loss and are less robust than fusion splices, especially if the gel is used. All splicing techniques involve installing an enclosure that protects the splice.|$|E

Although some European nations provided air-refueling aircraft, the conflict highlighted the problem Europe has {{with a lack}} of such aircraft and dependence on the United States for tanker support during a major operation. Some European nations sought to address this lack of capability, such as the Italian Air Force purchase of the Boeing KC-767, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> a huge difference in air-refueling capability between the US and some European air forces.|$|E
25|$|Huni's chronological {{position}} as the last king of the third dynasty is seen as fairly certain, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> some uncertainty on the succession order of rulers {{at the end of}} 3rdnbsp&dynasty. It is also unclear under which Hellenized name the ancient historian Manetho could have listed him in his historical writing Aegyptiacae. Most possibly he is to be identified with the Hellenized name Aches, as Winfried Barta proposes. Many Egyptologists believe that Huni was the father and direct predecessor of king Sneferu, but this is questioned by other scholars. Huni is seen by scholars as a confusing figure in Egyptian history, because he was long remembered in Egyptian traditions, but only very few documents, objects or monuments have endured.|$|E
25|$|Water quality remains good {{through the}} length of the river. Figures for the final section before it joins the River Idle show that the levels of ammonia and {{dissolved}} oxygen are those which would be expected in a natural ecosystem. Between 1991 and 2006, the BOD has been reduced by more than 50 percent, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> room for improvement. Levels of phosphates and nitrates, which are affected by agricultural activity, are quite high, but some improvements have occurred. Water quality is also measured by two biological indexes. These are NTAXA, which relates to the total number of invertebrate species found in samples of the water, and ASPT, (the Average Score Per Taxon), calculated from the numbers of specific invertebrates which are graded according to their sensitivity to organic pollution. The assessment for the years 2004 to 2006 rated the final section as grade A (very good) on the first index, and grade B (good) on the second. This indicates that the water is not far short from unpolluted.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, the International Atomic Energy Agency {{presented}} {{the results of}} a series of public opinion surveys in the Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues report. Majorities of respondents in 14 of the 18 countries surveyed believe that the risk of terrorist acts involving radioactive materials at nuclear facilities is high, because of insufficient protection. While majorities of citizens generally support the continued use of existing nuclear power reactors, most people do not favour the building of new nuclear plants, and 25% of respondents feel that all nuclear power plants should be closed down. Stressing the climate change benefits of nuclear energy positively influences 10% of people to be more supportive of expanding the role of nuclear power in the world, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> a general reluctance to support the building of more nuclear power plants. After the Fukushima Disaster, Civil Society Institute (CSI) found out that 58 percent of the respondents indicated less support of using nuclear power in the United States. Two-thirds of the respondents said they would protest the construction of a nuclear reactor within 50 miles of their homes.|$|E

500|$|By far {{the most}} {{explosive}} growth in species numbers (in absolute terms) {{has been in the}} genera Microcebus and Lepilemur.

[...] Since then, three additional species have been described, one of {{which turned out to be}} identical to a previously described species.

500|$|The name [...] "White Deer Hole Creek" [...] {{is unique}} in the USGS Geographic Names Information System and on its maps of the United States. Although the whole creek is now {{referred}} to by this name, in 1870 the name applied only to the section from the confluence with Spring Creek east to its mouth, while the main branch west of Spring Creek was called [...] "South Creek". Meginness used this name in 1892 and it appeared on a 1915 state map of Union County (but not the 1916 Lycoming County map). In 2009 the name [...] "South Creek" [...] has disappeared, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> a [...] "South Creek Road" [...] on the right bank of the creek in Gregg Township from {{near the mouth of}} Spring Creek west to the county line.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Moaning Lisa" [...] finished 34th {{place in the}} weekly ratings for the week of February 5–11, 1990 with a Nielsen rating of 13.8. It was the highest rated show on the Fox Network that week. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said: [...] "Certain scenes of this, the most syrupy of Simpsons episodes, sent viewers raised on the later seasons scurrying to the bathroom. Yes, the final moments may give you goosepimples, and are {{a world away from}} the anti-schmaltz normally associated with the series, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> much to recommend here. In fact, the Homer–Bart subplot is more successful than the main storyline; Homer's nightmare about their relationship is genuinely disturbing." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool midfielder Vladimír Šmicer {{was looking}} forward to playing a part in the final: [...] "Everyone wants to play in the final, I'm no different. I was just happy to be on the pitch against Auxerre because I didn't know even the day before whether I'd be fit enough after my injury problem. I'm still not 100% fit, I just wanted to train well this week and be fit for the final." [...] Šmicer was hopeful that victory in the final would rescue Liverpool's season: [...] "I hope that this re-ignites our season. Our season is not good, we know, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> plenty to play for. We have not said this is a bad season, let's forget about it and {{concentrate}} on the next one, we have been criticised and we are intent on responding on the pitch." [...] Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy was eager to win the match: [...] "Winning in Cardiff would be a massive result for us, we have to be honest, we haven't been as good as Manchester United over the last 10 years. And winning would bring European football next year, which isn't guaranteed at the moment." ...|$|E
