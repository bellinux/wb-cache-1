5000|$|The M96 is {{chambered}} for the [...]223 Remington/5.56 mm NATO cartridge, {{and uses}} STANAG 4179 AR-15 magazines. Barrels have 1-in-9 twist ratio as {{is common for}} [...]223 Remington semiautomatic rifles. The M96 is gas operated, with a fixed gas cylinder and moving piston connected to the operating rod and bolt carrier. All variants are equipped with a gas regulator, which allows fine-tuning for low or high powered cartridges, outside temperature, etc. and is probably unique for a civilian rifle in this caliber. The bolt carrier has been specially designed for strength and slow cyclic rate for improved reliability. The M96 bolt is a six-lug design somewhat similar to an AR-15 bolt but with larger, stronger lugs. The M96 receiver is stamped stainless steel with a special <b>blackening</b> <b>treatment.</b> The barrel is parkerized chromoly steel and the stocks are molded plastic. Incidentally, the buttstock is the {{one part of the}} M96 that is interchangeable with the Stoner 63. The M96 has adjustable military-type sights (rear aperture and front protected post) and does not have a standard scope mount or Picatinny rail.|$|E
40|$|THE {{observation}} that the nervous system of prawns contains fibres surrounded by a sheath which <b>blackens</b> on <b>treatment</b> with osmium tetroxide was first made in studies of Palaemon squilla by Retzius (1888, 1890) and Friedlander (1889). The descriptions which they gave of these remarkable fibres seem to have attracted littl...|$|R
5000|$|The Ford Explorer Sport was {{announced}} March 28, 2012 {{as an option}} for the 2013 model year and went on sale in June 2012. The [...] "Sport" [...] trim level comprises <b>blackened</b> exterior <b>treatments,</b> stiffened chassis and suspension, larger brakes and {{the installation of the}} EcoBoost 3.5L Twin Turbo V6 rated at [...] and [...] of torque. It is the only version to feature a combined 4WD/EcoBoost option (a FWD version is not being offered for the Sport trim), allowing its MPG to average between 16/city and 22/highway. [...] This version will be slotted above the Limited trim and is expected to compete in this segment against Jeep Grand Cherokee's SRT trim and Dodge Durango's R/T trims and a newly updated 2013 Chevrolet Traverse, the latter of which unveiled their new look on the same day as the Explorer Sport as their response to Ford's news.|$|R
40|$|In a pot {{experiment}} {{the problem of}} groundnut 'peg drying' where plants were slightly stunted with mottled leaves and blackened pegs and pods was investigated. Soil from the affected fields was used and plants were treated with dibromochloropropane or Vitavax [carboxin] and given 1. 43 mg boric acid/kg soil and/or 0. 5 g calcium sulphate/kg soil. Peg tips were <b>blackened</b> in all <b>treatments</b> to varying degrees. Plant growth was slightly improved by the nematicide but not by the fungicide which caused phytotoxic effects. Plant growth, root mass, number of pegs and pods and pod filling were improved by calcium and/or boron application...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} has {{investigated}} {{the application of}} high pressures (200 and 400 MPa) in chilled prawn tails, both conventionally stored (air) and vacuum packaged. Vacuum packaging and high-pressure treatment did extend the shelf life of the prawn samples, although it did affect muscle color very slightly, giving it a whiter appearance. The viable shelf life of 1 week for the air-stored samples was extended to 21 days in the vacuum-packed samples, 28 days in the samples treated at 200 MPa, and 35 days in the samples pressurized at 400 MPa. Vacuum packaging checked the onset of <b>blackening,</b> whereas high-pressure <b>treatment</b> aggravated the problem. From a microbiological point of view, batches conventionally stored reached about 6 log CFU/g or even higher at 14 days. Similar figures were reached in total number of bacteria in vacuum-packed samples and in pressurized at 200 -MPa samples at 21 days. When samples were pressurized at 400 MPa, total numbers of bacteria were below 5. 5 log CFU/g at 35 days of storage. Consequently, a combination of vacuum packaging and high-pressure treatment {{would appear to be}} beneficial in prolonging freshness and preventing spotting. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
