5|$|Kingsley Amis, in The James Bond Dossier, {{noted that}} {{although}} Bond {{is a very}} good shot and the best in the Secret Service, he is still beaten <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>instructor,</b> something that added realism to Bond's character. Amis identified a number of skills where Bond is very good, but is still beatable by others. These included skiing, hand-to-hand combat, underwater swimming and golf. Driving was also an ability Amis identified where Bond was good, but others were better; one of those who is a better driver than Bond is Sir Hugo Drax, who causes Bond to write off his battleship-grey supercharged Bentley 4½ Litre. Bond subsequently drives a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he uses in the remaining books of the series, although he is issued an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device during the course of Goldfinger.|$|E
25|$|Between 1989 and 1992, the AP-12 {{display system}} {{was subject to}} a {{substantial}} upgrade. In 1999, a new tactical liquid-crystal display (LCD) system derived from the Saab JAS 39 Gripen, which replaced the CRT-based AP-12 system, began flight tests with the Swedish Air Force. On the twin-seat SK 37 trainer, the rear cockpit used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>instructor</b> is only fitted with conventional instrumentation and lacks a HUD, computer controls and other features.|$|E
25|$|However {{technology}} {{also allows}} for a multitude of smaller workstations in a classroom setting. Administrators network student workstations so that the instructor can launch individual scenarios at each station. Computer models are used to accurately simulate conditions such as wind, seas, and currents. Moreover, shallow-water effects or other hydrodynamic forces, such as ships passing close to each other, can also be depicted. A computer application records training sessions, complete with voice commands issued <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>instructor</b> which are received by the students via a headset.|$|E

500|$|In various episodes, Santa's Little Helper {{can be seen}} {{chewing on}} {{newspapers}} and other objects in the Simpsons' household, destroying furniture, and digging holes in the backyard. In [...] "Bart's Dog Gets an F" [...] (season two, 1991), he manages to infuriate the entire family by destroying valued items in the home. As a result, Homer and Marge {{want to get rid}} of the dog, but Bart and Lisa convince them that he can be trained at an obedience school. Santa's Little Helper does not do well there as Bart is unwilling to use a choke chain suggested <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>instructor.</b> The night before the final exam, Bart and Santa's Little Helper play, thinking it will be their last few hours together. This bonding breaks down the communication barrier, allowing the dog to understand Bart's commands, and consequently pass the obedience school.|$|E
500|$|Summer {{vacation}} {{starts for}} AJ {{and his friends}} Danny and Morgan, {{who live in the}} city of Downer. When AJ wants to be spontaneous for his plans to spend the vacation, he impulsively decides to get a job. The trio comes across a corporate office. AJ wants to apply for the corporation that owns it, but Danny and Morgan suggest that he prepares for the interview. AJ turns to his father, Peter, for advice. He equips AJ with an oversized business suit, and afterward the trio enter the office to help AJ apply. AJ shows his resume, and immediately he is hired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Instructor</b> of First Impressions. Workers of the office welcome AJ, who wears the same style of business suit as they do. When he sees that each worker has their own assistant, AJ hires Morgan as his [...] "secretary" [...] and tells her to fetch papers. Meanwhile, he asks [...] "towel boy" [...] Danny to wipe the sweat off his brow.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Mahathir began {{stressing}} that Malays needed {{to abandon their}} [...] "crutches," [...] and implemented a policy of [...] "meritocracy". However, this policy by and large streams Bumiputras into what is termed matriculation, {{as a prelude to}} university admission, whereby students take a course and later sit for a test set <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>instructor.</b> The non-Bumiputras generally sit for the Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia (STPM) standardised examination to enter university. Although it is possible for non-Bumiputras to enter matriculation, and Bumiputras who prefer to take the STPM may do so, in practice, it is difficult for non-Bumiputras to gain entry into the matriculation stream.|$|E

2500|$|While Manilow was at Concord Records, the Barry Manilow Scholarship {{was awarded}} for four {{consecutive}} years (2002–2005) {{to the six}} highest-achieving students to reward excellence in the art and craft of lyric writing. The UCLA Extension course [...] "Writing Lyrics That Succeed and Endure" [...] was taught by long-time Manilow collaborator Marty Panzer, and each student received three additional [...] "master class" [...] advanced sessions {{as well as a}} three-hour private, one-on-one session with Panzer. Scholarship recipients were selected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>instructor</b> based on progress made within the course, lyric writing ability, and the instructor's assessment of real potential in the field of songwriting. In February 2002, Manilow returned to the charts when Arista released a greatest hits album, Ultimate Manilow. On May 18, 2002, Manilow returned to CBS with Ultimate Manilow, his first special at the network since his Big Fun on Swing Street special in 1988.

60|$|The {{ignorance of}} most of our {{classical}} students {{in regard to the}} history of English literature is appalling; and yet it is impossible properly to study a given work of a given author without some knowledge of the background against which that particular writer stands. I have, therefore, sketched the politics, society, and literature of the age in which Dryden lived, and during which he gave to the world his Palamon and Arcite. In the critical comments of the introduction I have contented myself with little more than hints. That particular line of study, whether it concerns the poet's style, his verse forms, or the possession of the divine instinct itself, can be much more satisfactorily developed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>instructor,</b> as the student's knowledge of the poem grows.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes units {{also have}} a {{separate}} awards ceremony, which is attended <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>instructors,</b> guests, and parents.

60|$|For {{the first}} five minutes it was as even a fight as one could have wished to see. It raged {{up and down the}} road without a pause, now in a solid mass, now {{splitting}} up into little groups. The science was {{on the side of the}} school. Most Wrykynians knew how to box to a certain extent. But, at any rate at first, it was no time for science. To be scientific one must have an opponent who observes at least the more important rules of the ring. It is impossible to do the latest ducks and hooks taught you <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>instructor</b> if your antagonist butts you in the chest, and then kicks your shins, while some dear friend of his, of whose presence you had no idea, hits you at the same time on the back of the head. The greatest expert would lose his science in such circumstances.|$|E
