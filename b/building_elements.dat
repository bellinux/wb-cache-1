The caretaker stayed in the premises until March 1991, when lease arrangement difficulties and the previous failure of the mains forced the caretaker's withdrawal. It only took until September 1991 for vandals to destroy the keepers' cottages by fire. In 1992 the Australian Construction Services cleared the site and stabilised some of the <b>building</b> <b>elements,</b> and a security fence was installed.|$|E
5|$|The Iraqi {{offensive}} {{began on}} the night of 29 January, when approximately 2,000 soldiers in several hundred armored fighting vehicles moved south. The Gulf War's first ground engagement was near observation post 4, built on the Al-Zabr police <b>building.</b> <b>Elements</b> of the Iraqi 6th Armored Brigade, ordered to take the heights above Al-Zabr, engaged Coalition units at Al-Zabr. At 20:00 hours, U.S. Marines at the observation post, who had noticed large groups of armored vehicles through their night vision devices, attempted to talk to battalion headquarters but received no response. Contact was not established until 20:30 hours, which prompted Task Force Shepard to respond to the threat. Coalition soldiers at observation post 4 opened fire on the Iraqi column, but this largely ineffective fire drew a heavy Iraqi response which forced the company to retire south, by order of its commanding officer.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} form of seismic {{retrofit}} to lower buildings is adding strength to the existing structure to resist seismic forces. The strengthening may be limited to connections between existing <b>building</b> <b>elements</b> or it may involve adding primary resisting elements such as walls or frames, particularly in the lower stories.|$|E

25|$|Amsterdam's 1912 cooperative-commercial Scheepvaarthuis (Shipping House) is {{considered}} the starting point and prototype for Amsterdam School work: brick construction with complicated masonry, traditional massing, and the integration of an elaborate scheme of <b>building</b> <b>elements</b> (decorative masonry, art glass, wrought-iron work, and exterior figurative sculpture) that embodies and expresses {{the identity of the}} building. The School flourished until about 1925.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{materials}} like stone, {{mortar and}} clay were abandoned as <b>building</b> <b>elements,</b> with simple wooden walls, floors and partitions becoming prevalent. Native species like cedar (sugi) were popular as an interior finish {{because of its}} prominent grain, while pine (matsu) and larch (aka matsu) were common for structural uses. Brick roofing tiles and a type of cypress called hinoki were used for roofs. It was sometime during this period that the hidden roof, a uniquely Japanese solution to roof drainage problems, was adopted.|$|E
25|$|Sophisticated 3-D {{building}} energy simulation {{tools are}} available to model how a building will perform {{with a range of}} design variables such as building orientation (relative to the daily and seasonal position of the sun), window and door type and placement, overhang depth, insulation type and values of the <b>building</b> <b>elements,</b> air tightness (weatherization), the efficiency of heating, cooling, lighting and other equipment, as well as local climate. These simulations help the designers predict how the building will perform before it is built, and enable them to model the economic and financial implications on building cost benefit analysis, or even more appropriate – life cycle assessment.|$|E

25|$|Clay {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{building}} materials on Earth, among other ancient, naturally-occurring geologic materials such as stone and organic materials like wood. Between one-half and two-thirds of the world's population, in both traditional societies as well as developed countries, still live or work in buildings made with clay, often baked into brick, as an essential part of its load-bearing structure. Also a primary ingredient in many natural building techniques, clay is used to create adobe, cob, cordwood, and rammed earth structures and <b>building</b> <b>elements</b> such as wattle and daub, clay plaster, clay render case, clay floors and clay paints and ceramic building material. Clay was used as a mortar in brick chimneys and stone walls where protected from water.|$|E
500|$|The {{structure}} for the blocks was a challenge. [...] At first, the design team had considered switching to plastic blocks, until the team found Circle Redmont Inc., a prefabricated glass panel company in Melbourne, Florida which specializes in structural glass panel systems. [...] Circle Redmont {{came up with the}} plan of turning grates on their sides to be used as <b>building</b> <b>elements.</b> The individual grids are [...] tall and either [...] or [...] wide with cell capacity of an average of 250 blocks. [...] Each tower is composed of 44 grids stacked and welded. [...] The combination of the refraction of the glass and the thinness of the metal make the grid virtually invisible.|$|E
500|$|According to Safdie, the {{building}} [...] "is by definition the physical symbol {{of peace in}} the capital's skyline" [...] and needed to convey the spirit of peace. [...] Safdie stated: [...] "I'm not one who believes in overt symbolism, but my sense of a building dedicated to peace {{was a sense of}} the lightness of being,...It should be a serene building. It should not be an aggressive building. It should be full of light." [...] Safdie achieved this by designing a glass curtain wall facing the Lincoln Memorial and a billowing glass ceiling. [...] The ceiling is one of the <b>building</b> <b>elements</b> in common with Safdie's design for the Yitzhak Rabin Center in Israel. [...] The [...] thick roof is made of 1,482 white glass panels and supported by steel frames while the interior of the roof is covered by a translucent plastic film. [...] It is opaque and white during the day and glows at night.|$|E

50|$|The U-factor or U-value, is {{the overall}} heat {{transfer}} coefficient that describes how well a <b>building</b> <b>element</b> conducts heat or the rate of transfer of heat (in watts) through one square metre of a structure divided by the difference in temperature across the structure. The elements are commonly assemblies of many layers of components such as those that make up walls/floors/roofs etc. It measures the rate of heat transfer through a <b>building</b> <b>element</b> over a given area under standardised conditions. The usual standard is at a temperature gradient of 24 °C (75.2 °F), at 50% humidity with no wind (a smaller U-factor is better at reducing heat transfer). It is expressed in watts per meter squared kelvin (W/m²K). This means that the higher the U-value the worse the thermal performance of the building envelope. A low U-value usually indicates high levels of insulation. They are useful as {{it is a way of}} predicting the composite behavior of an entire <b>building</b> <b>element</b> rather than relying on the properties of individual materials.|$|R
2500|$|The {{geometry}} of the building {{is based on a}} triangle, most obviously manifested for visitors in the coffered ceiling grids and tiles of the principal floor. Madigan said of this device that it was [...] "the intention of the architectural concept to implant into the grammar of the design a sense of freedom so that the building could be submitted to change and variety but would always express its true purpose". [...] This geometry flows throughout the building, and is reflected in the triangular stair towers, columns and <b>building</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|E
2500|$|With {{a barrel}} vault design the vectors of {{pressure}} {{result in a}} downward force on the crown while the lower portions of the arches realise a lateral force pushing outwards. [...] As an outcome this form of design is subject to failure unless the sides are anchored or buttressed to very heavy <b>building</b> <b>elements</b> or substantial earthwork sidings. [...] For example, at Muchalls Castle in Scotland adjacent walls to the barrel vaulted chambers are up to 4,6 meters (15feet) thick, adding the buttressing strength needed to secure the curved design. Well documented cases exist of the long term stress effects on inadequately laterally supported barrel vaults such as the 17th century church of Guimarei.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{strengths}} of concrete {{are used for}} different purposes. [...] Very low-strength - [...] or less - [...] concrete may be used when the concrete must be lightweight. [...] Lightweight concrete is often achieved by adding air, foams, or lightweight aggregates, with the side effect that the strength is reduced. [...] For most routine uses, [...] to [...] concrete is often used. [...] concrete is readily commercially available as a more durable, although more expensive, option. [...] Higher-strength concrete is often used for larger civil projects. [...] Strengths above [...] are often used for specific <b>building</b> <b>elements.</b> [...] For example, the lower floor columns of high-rise concrete buildings may use concrete of [...] or more, to keep {{the size of the}} columns small. [...] Bridges may use long beams of high-strength concrete to lower the number of spans required. [...] Occasionally, other structural needs may require high-strength concrete. If a structure must be very rigid, concrete of very high strength may be specified, even much stronger than is required to bear the service loads. Strengths as high as [...] have been used commercially for these reasons.|$|E
