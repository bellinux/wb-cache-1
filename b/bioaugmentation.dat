50|$|<b>Bioaugmentation</b> {{is favored}} in a {{contaminated}} area because microorganisms that were originally {{in the environment}} did not accomplish their task during bioremediation {{when it came to}} breaking down chemicals in the contaminated soil. A potential reason for this can be due to environmental stresses, as well as changes in the microbial population due to mutation rates. When microorganisms are added, they are potentially more suited {{to the nature of the}} new contaminant, meanwhile the older microorganisms are similar to the older pollution and contamination. However, this is merely one of many factors; site size is also a very important determinant. In order to see whether <b>bioaugmentation</b> should be implemented, the overall setting must be considered. Also, some highly specialized microorganisms are not capable of adapting to certain site settings. And, availability of certain microorganism types (as used for bioremediation) may also be a problem. Although <b>bioaugmentation</b> may appear to be a perfect solution to contaminated soil, it can have its drawbacks.

According to the United States EPA, bioremediation is a [...] "treatment that uses naturally occurring organisms to break down hazardous substances into less toxic or non toxic substances". Technologies can be generally classified as in situ or ex situ. In situ bioremediation involves treating the contaminated material at the site, while ex situ involves the removal of the contaminated material to be treated elsewhere. Some examples of bioremediation related technologies are phytoremediation, bioventing, bioleaching, landfarming, bioreactor, composting, <b>bioaugmentation,</b> rhizofiltration, and biostimulation.|$|E

Many used to simply place dirt over the pit, but it is far more productive and economically beneficial to use <b>bioaugmentation.</b> With the use of advanced microbes, drilling companies can actually treat the problem in the oilfield pit instead of transferring the waste around. Given suitable environmental conditions, microbes are placed in the oilpit to break down hydrocarbons and alongside are other nutrients. Before treatment there was a total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) level of 44,880 ppm, which within just 47 days the TPH was lowered to a level of 10,000 ppm to 6,486 ppm.

5000|$|The {{genes for}} enzymes AtzA-C {{have been found}} to be highly conserved in atrazine-degrading organisms worldwide. In Pseudomonas sp.

The {{insertion}} elements flanking each gene suggest that they are involved in the assembly of this specialized catabolic pathway. Two options exist for degradation of atrazine using microbes, <b>bioaugmentation</b> or biostimulation. Recent research suggests that microbial adaptation to atrazine has occurred in some fields where the herbicide is used repetitively, resulting in more rapid biodegradation. Like the herbicides trifluralin and alachlor, atrazine is susceptible to rapid transformation in the presence of reduced iron-bearing soil clays, such as ferruginous smectites. In natural environments, some iron-bearing minerals are reduced by specific bacteria in the absence of oxygen, thus the abiotic transformation of herbicides by reduced minerals is viewed as [...] "microbially induced".|$|E
50|$|Biostimulation {{involves}} the {{modification of the}} environment to stimulate existing bacteria capable of bioremediation. This {{can be done by}} addition of various forms of rate limiting nutrients and electron acceptors, such as phosphorus, nitrogen, oxygen, or carbon (e.g. in the form of molasses). Alternatively, remediation of halogenated contaminants in anaerobic environments may be stimulated by adding electron donors (organic substrates), thus allowing indigenous microorganisms to use the halogenated contaminants as electron acceptors.EPA Anaerobic Bioremediation Technologies Additives are usually added to the subsurface through injection wells, although injection well technology for biostimulation purposes is still emerging. Removal of the contaminated material is also an option, albeit an expensive one. Biostimulation can be enhanced by <b>bioaugmentation.</b> This process, overall, is referred to as bioremediation and is an EPA-approved method for reversing the presence of oil or gas spills.

5000|$|Accelerated in situ {{bioremediation}} {{is defined}} when a specified microorganism is targeted for growth {{through the application}} of either nutrients or an electron donor to the contaminated site.

[...] Besides nutrients, microorganisms can also be introduced directly to the site within accelerated in situ bioremediation. The addition of extraneous microorganisms to a site is termed <b>bioaugmentation</b> and is used when a particular microorganism is effective at degrading the pollutant at the site and is not found either naturally or at a high enough population to be effective. Accelerated in situ bioremediation is utilized when the desired population of microorganisms within a site is not naturally present at a sufficient level to effectively degrade the pollutants. It also is used when the required nutrients within the site are either not at a concentration sufficient to support growth or are unavailable.|$|E

50|$|In {{spite of}} its advantages, the main {{challenge}} observed with fermentative H2 production processes is the relatively low energy conversion efficiency from the organic source. Typical H2 yields range from 1 to 2 mol of H2/mol of glucose, which results in 80-90% of the initial COD remaining in the wastewater {{in the form of}} various volatile organic acids (VFAs) and solvents, such as acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and ethanol. Even under optimal conditions about 60-70% of the original organic matter remains in solution. <b>Bioaugmentation</b> with selectively enriched acidogenic consortia to enhance H2 production was also reported (Venkata Mohan, et al., 2007b). Generation and accumulation of soluble acid metabolites causes a sharp drop in the system pH and inhibits the H2 production process. Usage of unutilized carbon sources present in acidogenic process for additional biogas production sustains the practical applicability of the process. One way to utilize/recover the remaining organic matter in a usable form is to produce additional H2 by terminal integration of photo-fermentative processes of H2 production (Venkata Mohan, et al. 2008e, Rai et al. 2012) and methane by integrating acidogenic processes to terminal methanogenic processes.|$|E
