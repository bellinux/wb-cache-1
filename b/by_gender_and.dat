25|$|Begun in 1955, Cherry Street Hall, {{located at}} 5030 Cherry Street, {{was a more}} traditional-style {{dormitory}} on the UMKC Volker campus. It housed approximately 300 students in 168 single, double and triple rooms with each floor being separated <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> sharing a communal bathroom. Cherry Street Hall was often regarded by students as having better opportunities for social interaction than Oak Street. In August 2009, Cherry Street Hall was closed as a student residence. In May 2011 the Psychology Department moved into the newly renovated Cherry Hall.|$|E
25|$|Tournaments {{are often}} {{organized}} <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> number of players. Common tournament configurations include men's singles, women's singles, and doubles, where two players play {{on each side}} of the net. Tournaments may be organized for specific age groups, with upper age limits for youth and lower age limits for senior players. Example of this include the Orange Bowl and Les Petits As junior tournaments. There are also tournaments for players with disabilities, such as wheelchair tennis and deaf tennis. In the four Grand Slam tournaments, the singles draws are limited to 128 players for each gender.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{business}} suits are generally in solid colours or with pin stripes; windowpane checks are also acceptable. Outside business, {{the range of}} acceptable patterns widens, with plaids such as the traditional glen plaid and herringbone, though apart from some very traditional environments such as London banking, these are worn for business now too. The colour of the patterned element (stripes, plaids, and checks) varies <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> location. For example, bold checks, particularly with tweeds, have fallen out of use in the US, while {{they continue to be}} worn as traditionally in Britain. Some unusual old patterns such as diamonds are now rare everywhere.|$|E
25|$|People make {{exceptions}} to and modify their space requirements. A number of relationships may allow for personal space to be modified, including familial ties, romantic partners, friendships and close acquaintances, {{where there is}} a greater degree of trust and personal knowledge. Personal space is affected by a person's position in society, with more affluent individuals expecting a larger personal space. Personal space also varies <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> age. Males typically use more personal space than females, and personal space has a positive relation to age (people use more as they get older). Most people have a fully developed (adult) sense of personal space by age twelve.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the Pentagon was done {{during a time when}} parts of the U.S. were under legally-mandated racial segregation. This had structural consequences to the design of the building. Under the supervision of colonel Leslie Groves, the decision to have separate eating and lavatory accommodations for white persons and black persons was made and carried out. The dining areas for black persons were put in the basement and on each floor there were double toilet facilities separated <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> race. These measures of segregation were said to have been done in compliance with the U.S. Commonwealth of Virginia's racial laws. The Pentagon as a result has twice the number of toilet facilities needed for a building of its size.|$|E

25|$|Some {{examples}} {{of social and}} religious transition ceremonies {{that can be found}} in the U.S., as well as in other cultures around the world, are Confirmation, Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, Quinceañeras, sweet sixteens, cotillions, and débutante balls. In other countries, initiation ceremonies play an important role, marking the transition into adulthood or the entrance into adolescence. This transition may be accompanied by obvious physical changes, which can vary from a change in clothing to tattoos and scarification. Furthermore, transitions into adulthood may also vary <b>by</b> <b>gender,</b> <b>and</b> specific rituals may be more common for males or for females. This illuminates the extent to which adolescence is, at least in part, a social construction; it takes shape differently depending on the cultural context, and may be enforced more by cultural practices or transitions than by universal chemical or biological physical changes.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} {{and interviews with}} members of open source projects have described a male-dominated culture within open source communities that can be unwelcoming or hostile towards females. There are an initiatives such as Outreachy that aim to support more women and other underrepresented gender identities to participate in open source software. However, within the discussion forums of open source projects the topic of gender diversity can be highly controversial and even inflammatory. A central vision in open source software is that because the software is built and maintained on the merit of individual code contributions, open source communities should act as a meritocracy. In a meritocracy, the importance of an individual in the community depends {{on the quality of}} their individual contributions and not demographic factors such as age, race, religion, or gender. Thus proposing changes to the community based on gender, for example, to make the community more inviting towards females, go against the ideal of a meritocracy by targeting certain programmers <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> no based on their skill alone.|$|E
25|$|A {{skipping}} rope (British English) or jump rope (American English) {{is a tool}} used in the sport of jump rope where one or more participants jump over a rope swung so that it passes under their feet and over their heads. There are multiple subsets of jump rope including: single freestyle, single speed, pairs, three person speed (double dutch), and three person freestyle (double dutch freestyle). The events are often separated <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> age. There are hundreds of competitive teams all around the world. There are a few major organisations that support jump rope as a sport as seen below, schools rarely have jump rope teams, and states do not sanction official events for high school or elementary school. In freestyle events, jumpers {{use a variety of}} basic and advanced techniques in a routine of one minute, which is judged by a head judge, content judges, and performance judges. In speed events, a jumper alternates their feet with the rope going around the jumper every time one of their feet hit the ground for 30 seconds, one minute, or three minutes. The jumper is judged on the number of times the right foot touches the ground in those times.|$|E

25|$|Prison {{reformer}} John Howard (1726–1790) visited Lancaster in 1776 {{and noted}} {{the conditions in}} the prison. His efforts to instigate reform led to prisoners in gaols throughout the country being separated <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> category of their crime. Improvements were also made to sanitation; in the 18thcentury more people died from gaol fever than by hanging. In {{the last two decades}} of the century, around £30,000 was spent rebuilding Lancaster's county gaol. Architect Thomas Harrison was commissioned to complete the work. Under his auspices, the Gaoler's House was built in 1788 in a Gothic style. Separate prisons were built for men and women. The Shire Hall and Crown Court were complete by 1798. Harrison had to divide his time between Lancaster and designing and building Chester Castle's Shire Hall and Courts; work at Lancaster slowed, partly because of dwindling funds due to war with France, and Harrison was released from the work as the Justices of the Peace felt it was taking too long. The artist Robert Freebairn was paid £500 to paint twelve watercolours of the work in 1800 to be presented to the Duke of Lancaster, King GeorgeIII. In 1802 the castle received more funding and Joseph Gandy was commissioned to complete the interiors of the Shire Hall and Crown Court.|$|E

Activity patterns {{within the community}} range vary <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> season. Males generally stay within a core area all year, whereas females only confine themselves to a core area during the cold wet season, then expand their range throughout the community range during the hot, rainy season. Females expand their traveling range slightly after giving birth, still staying within the core area, but gradually range further in December when they begin stashing their infants with other community members while they look for food. Females range the furthest later during the hot, rainy season. Both activity level and reproductive activity can be summarized in the following table.|$|E

Interested in film at a young age, she took film studies at the University of Toronto and, later, New York University. While in {{university}} she was influenced <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> minority theories, as reflected in her first film, the short Sally's Beauty Spot (1990). While continuing her studies she produced two more films before taking a five-year hiatus to live in Korea beginning in 1995. After her return, she released another short film and her feature film debut, The Art of Woo (2001). She continues to produce short films, although at a reduced rate. Lee's films often deal with gender and racial issues, reflecting the state of East Asians in modern society; a common theme in her work is sexuality, with several films featuring interracial relationships.|$|E
