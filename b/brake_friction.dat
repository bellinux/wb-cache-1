40|$|Tire-road {{interaction}} addresses safety {{with respect}} to <b>braking</b> <b>friction</b> and energy efficiency {{in the context of}} rolling resistance. These phenomena are coherent, but their engineering solutions can be contradictory. For example, highly skid-resistant surfaces may not be ideal for fuel economy, but surfaces with low rolling resistance may be prone to skidding. Several experimental and numerical studies have investigated the individual phenomena, but insufficient {{attention has been paid to}} studying them coherently. The present study computed <b>braking</b> <b>friction</b> and rolling resistance for various operating parameters and their coherent response for each parameter with the use of a thermomechanical contact algorithm. Micromechanical finite element simulations of a rolling or braking pneumatic tire against selected asphalt concrete surfaces were performed for various operating conditions, such as tire load, inflation pressure, speed, and ambient air and pavement temperatures. The coefficients of <b>braking</b> <b>friction</b> and rolling resistance were found to decrease with the inflation pressure and the temperature and to increase with the wheel load. The <b>braking</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient was found to decrease with the speed, in contrast to the rolling resistance coefficient, which increases with the same parameter. A full-skidding tire registered lower <b>braking</b> <b>friction</b> than a 20 % slipping tire. Also, an asphalt surface with higher macrotexture offered higher <b>braking</b> <b>friction</b> and higher rolling resistance, and vice versa...|$|R

5000|$|Drum brakes have {{a natural}} [...] "self-applying" [...] characteristic, better known as [...] "self-energizing." [...] The {{rotation}} of the drum can drag either {{one or both of}} the shoes into the friction surface, causing the brakes to bite harder, which increases the force holding them together. This increases the stopping power without any additional effort being expended by the driver, but it does make it harder for the driver to modulate the brake's sensitivity. It also makes the brake more sensitive to brake fade, as a decrease in <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> also reduces the amount of brake assist.|$|E

25|$|A {{band brake}} {{consists}} of a band, strap, or cable that wraps around a drum that rotates with a wheel and is pulled tight to generate <b>braking</b> <b>friction.</b> Band <b>brakes</b> appeared as early as 1884 on tricycles. Star Cycles introduced a band brake in 1902 on its bicycles with freewheels. Band brakes are still manufactured for bicycles today.|$|R
50|$|When the {{traction}} control computer (often incorporated into another control unit, {{such as the}} ABS module) detects one or more driven wheels spinning significantly faster than another, it invokes the ABS electronic control unit to apply <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> to wheels spinning with lessened traction. Braking action on slipping wheel(s) will cause power transfer to wheel axle(s) with traction due to the mechanical action within the differential. All-wheel drive (AWD) vehicles often have an electronically controlled coupling system in the transfer case or transaxle engaged (active part-time AWD), or locked-up tighter (in a true full-time set up driving all wheels with some power all the time) to supply non-slipping wheels with torque.|$|E
50|$|These {{systems are}} {{alternatives}} {{to a traditional}} limited-slip differential. The systems harness various chassis sensors such as speed sensors, anti-lock braking system (ABS) sensors, accelerometers, and microcomputers to electronically monitor wheel slip and vehicle motion. When the chassis control system determines a wheel is slipping, the computer applies the brakes to that wheel. A {{significant difference between the}} limited-slip differential systems listed above and this brake-based system, is that brake-based systems do not inherently send the greater torque to the slower wheel, plus the added <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> material wear that results from the use of such a system if the vehicle is driven in an environment where the brake-based system will activate on a regular basis.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} in expansion characteristics between rubber and braided stainless steel brake lines {{is a result}} of differences in hose construction. Where rubber hoses typically consist of a rubber inner hose wrapped in a textile reinforcement braid then covered in an additional rubber outer sheath, braided stainless steel hoses typically consist of a Teflon® or generic PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) inner hose wrapped in a braid consisting of stainless steel wire. The stainless wire braid more effectively resists expansion due to pressure inside the hose core. This improves brake system effectiveness by more directly transferring operator input (hydraulic pressure) to <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> surfaces. While available without a coating, the stainless braid is typically coated or covered with a clear or colored material such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) to protect the wire and inner hose from the elements and chemicals, to protect the vehicle or machine from abrasion, and for an improved appearance. Coated braided stainless steel hoses have the same essential construction as rubber hoses in terms of an inner hose wrapped in a braid followed by an outer layer, but the different materials in the braided stainless steel hoses offer substantially different and arguably better characteristics. To more thoroughly explain why, it is helpful to understand the basics of a hydraulic brake system.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to generate the knowledge for formulating low-Cu and Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials without using and releasing hazardous materials that are listed on Washington State and California State Senate Bills. Model brake material samples were manufactured and tested in the Friction Assessment and Screening Test (FAST) and the full scale automotive brake dynamometer (Dyno) using a SAE J 2430 test procedure. The SAE recommended a J 2430 test procedure which provided the necessary data for the Brake Effectiveness Evaluation Procedure (BEEP) by the Brake Manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 Council. The newly developed low-Cu and Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials were formulated by modifying a typical Non Asbestos Organic (NAO) (T-Baseline) formulation and a typical Semi-Metallic (M-Baseline) formulation. The NAO Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials contain geopolymer and natural hemp fibers as a partial replacement of phenolic resin and synthetic Kevlar fibers, respectively. Friction performance and wear data from a series of FAST tests were used to train an artificial neural network, which was used to optimize the NAO Cu-free formulations. Then, the optimized low-Cu and Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials were tested on the Dyno. Dyno test results showed that all NAO Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials have passed the Brake Effectiveness Evaluation Procedure (BEEP), did not exhibit thermal fade when temperature was increased and were slightly sensitive to speed. The NAO Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials exhibits slightly lower average friction level when compared to the baseline materials (T-Baseline). The Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials, as well as the rotors, exhibit higher wear than the detected wear on the T-Baseline material. The semi-metallic low-Cu and Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials have also passed the BEEP. Dyno test results indicated that the semi-metallic low-Cu and Cu-free friction materials did not exhibit thermal fade and were slightly sensitive to speed. The semi-metallic low-Cu and Cu-free materials exhibited lower friction level and higher wear on the pads when compared to the M-Baseline material. The semi-metallic Cu-free material outperformed the M-Baseline material in term of rotor wear. Analyses using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) microanalysis on the tested materials show that the friction surface of the T-baseline material was covered with fully developed and stable friction layer (third body) consisting mostly of Fe-oxides, different forms of carbon and compounds of materials originally present in the bulk material. The NAO Cu-free materials (T 30 - 15 and T 30 - 16) did not develop a sufficient friction layer. The friction layer seemed to be responsible for the detected lower wear in the T-Baseline compared to the NAO Cu-free materials (T 30 - 15 and T 30 - 16), and it acted as a solid lubricant on the interface between the rubbing pad and the cast iron rotor lowering the adhesive forces. The friction and wear of the T-Baseline material was controlled by adhesive mechanisms. The NAO Cu-free materials (T 30 - 15 and T 30 - 16) with content of geopolymer replacing phenolic resin matrix exhibited extensive abrasive wear in addition to adhesive mechanisms. The capacity to form a friction layer on the surface plays a considerable role when lowering the wear of NAO <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials. The friction layer was formed by compaction and interaction of brake wear particles, and its stability and character depend on the chemistry of the bulk materials in contact as well as the temperature, pressure and sliding speed during a friction process. SEM and EDX analyses also showed that the semi-metallic pads have developed friction layer on the friction surfaces. The difference was that the M-Baseline material had well developed friction layer, but the Low-Cu (M 4) and Cu-free (M 5) materials, had many smaller patches of friction layer disturbed on the surfaces...|$|E

Friction coefficient of the friction composites containing SiC increased with increasing SiC content; especially, the thermal fade of the friction material without SiC (SiC- 0) improved. The specific wear {{rate of the}} friction composites containing SiC increased with SiC added up to 9. 0 vol. % and then turned down, but the negative specific wear rate of SiC- 0 obviously improved. With elevating friction temperature, an increase in both friction coefficient and wear of all the samples was observed. The extension evaluation method represents an effective tool to rank the friction composites. The ranking of five friction materials, described in the weighted average dependent degrees, was evaluated in the order from the best to the worst: SiC- 3. 4, SiC- 14. 6, SiC- 5. 6, SiC- 0, and SiC- 9. 0.

The tests were carried out in the VTI tyre testing facility on smooth and roughened water covered ice at a speed of 30 km/h. Water covered ice can be {{regarded as one of the}} most dangerous road conditions. Both braking tests and steering tests were performed. The braking tests measured maximum <b>braking</b> <b>friction</b> corresponding to ideal ABS <b>braking</b> performance and <b>friction</b> with a locked wheel. The steering tests measured maximum lateral friction and friction at a 20 -degree side slip angle (skid angle). The latter value represents conditions in skidding of the whole vehicle or excessive steering angle when entering a curve. The results on water covered smooth ice show that a new non studded winter tyre can get about 30 % improved <b>braking</b> <b>friction</b> and about 40 % improved steering friction by means of mixing the special aggregate composition into the tread rubber compound. Testing this improved tyre on water covered stud roughened ice showed that the friction for normal driving is practically the same as on smooth ice.
