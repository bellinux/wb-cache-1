The plot features a poetess who {{falls in love}} with and marries an insipid young poet, giving up her own writing to attend to his needs. She becomes bored, writes a successful play, and then goes mad. The False Laurel was the least successful of her books, selling fewer than 200 copies. It received a poor review from The Bookman <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> one from The Athenaeneum.|$|E

The {{design for}} the chassis featured rear wheel steering and packaged the fuel tank behind the centre bulkhead. Suspension design largely focused on road use, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable. The concept car was fitted with a four-channel anti-lock braking system.|$|E
5|$|In 1066, {{the comet}} {{was seen in}} England and thought to be an omen: later that year Harold II of England died at the Battle of Hastings; {{it was a bad}} omen for Harold, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> omen for the man who {{defeated}} him, William the Conqueror. The comet is represented on the Bayeux Tapestry and described in the tituli as a star. Surviving accounts from the period describe it as appearing to be four times the size of Venus and shining with a light equal to a quarter of that of the Moon. Halley came within 0.10AU of Earth at that time.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E
5|$|This {{variation}} {{is named after}} Alekhine thanks to his wins in the games Alekhine–Rabinovic (Baden Baden, 1925) and Alekhine–Seitz (Hastings, 1926). White does not try to keep its material advantage (the e5-pawn) and concentrates on establishing a strong pawn center and space advantage. A controversial point is whether the typical black manoeuvre Bf8–b4–xc3 is advantageous for Black (as it saddles White with doubled pawns) or for White (as it reinforces his centre). Lalic thinks both, considering 6...Bb4+ {{to be a bad}} move after 4...Nxe5 5.f4 Nec6 6.Nf3, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> one after 4...Nxe5 5.f4Nec6 6.Be3. After 4.e4 the main line is 4...Nxe55.f4 when Black has an important choice to make about where to move the Ne5. The retreat to the queenside with 5...Nec6 is considered best, while the retreat to the kingside with 5...Ng6 is probably playable.|$|E

25|$|This {{design is}} simple, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{basis for a}} {{practical}} design because it automatically stabilises its operating point, since feedback internally operates from DC up through the audio range and beyond. Further circuit elements would probably {{be found in a}} real design that would roll-off the frequency response above the needed range to prevent the possibility of unwanted oscillation. Also, the use of fixed diode bias as shown here can cause problems if the diodes are not both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors if the output transistors turn on too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage.|$|E
25|$|England started well {{getting the}} early wicket of Devon Smith {{in the third}} over, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{partnership}} between Chris Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, producing a second-wicket partnership of 77 gave West Indies a strong platform. England then got two quick wickets of Chanderpaul and Samuels {{in the space of}} 15 deliveries to put the game in the balance. West Indies solidified their position, however, with Runako Morton and Chris Gayle putting on 85 for the fourth wicket. Quick batting from Dwayne Bravo (42 runs from 24 balls) ensured that the West Indies set a good score of 289/5 {{at the end of the}} innings and England needed 290 runs to win.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no trace}} of reason in God because reason is desire and God lacks nothing. Adam was not created in reason. Had it been otherwise, his problem could have been healed by natural {{learning}} {{and there would be}} no need of Christ and no need of faith. The worldly case against reason is that its products do not last: a great remedy for some human problem is devised but soon lost patience with and a new novelty is again demanded. Thus thy wisdom is thy woe. Reason should not be discarded but placed as subservient to faith. Reason, like fire and water, is a bad master <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> servant. Above all, one cannot use reason to seek out the Lord.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{noticed that the}} {{elements}} in the boron group have similar physical properties, although most of boron's are exceptional. For example, all of the elements in the boron group, except for boron itself, are soft. Moreover, {{all of the other}} elements in group 13 are relatively reactive at moderate temperatures, while boron's reactivity only becomes comparable at very high temperatures. One characteristic that all do have in common is having three electrons in their valence shells. Boron, being a metalloid, is a thermal and electrical insulator at room temperature, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> conductor of heat and electricity at high temperatures. Unlike boron, the metals in the group are good conductors under normal conditions. This is in accordance with the long-standing generalization that all metals conduct heat and electricity better than most non-metals.|$|E
25|$|Beauty is a Wound is a {{novel by}} Indonesian author Eka Kurniawan, {{published}} in 2002. The novel weaves history into satire, tragedy and the supernatural to depict {{the state of the}} nation before, during and after the 1965 incidents. There is less focus on the military aspect of the coup, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of focus on the communists themselves through the form of interpersonal relationships and communist ghosts who could not find peace. Without meaning to, perhaps, the novel also gives readers a glimpse of the economy of Indonesia at the time using the example of a flourishing prostitute business and a temporary swimsuit business, among others. Kurniawan projects his feelings about the revolution and coup by constructing a story of theatrical characters around it and delivers a history of the nation all the way from Dutch occupation to Suharto.|$|E

That game was later on won by Joe Pavelski in overtime, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{response}} by the Kings in game two gave them a 4-0 shutout victory in San Jose. In game three, San Jose became the fifth team in NHL playoff history to win a game after facing a 4–0 deficit, where Devin Setoguchi of San Jose scored the game-winning goal in overtime, to make the final score 6-5. Still, at home, Los Angeles lost game four by a score of 6–3. In game five, at San Jose, Los Angeles would win by a score of 3–1. However, that would not be enough, as Joe Thornton of San Jose scored the game-winning goal in overtime of game six to eliminate Los Angeles from the playoffs, in a 4-2 series win.|$|E
25|$|The Australian women's cricket team toured England in August and September 2005. They played five One-day Internationals (ODIs), two Test {{matches and}} one Twenty20 International.

Brunt was also the heroine of the second Test, where she took nine wickets in the match and made 52 in England's first Test win over the Australians since December 1984. It also gave England their first win in the Women's Ashes since 1963. England also won their next ODI thanks to a century from Claire Taylor, but Australia took the series 32 after winning the last ODI by just four runs. The last match of the series was a Twenty20 International, which was Australia's first, and they won it by seven wickets.|$|E
25|$|Nicolas Flamel is a {{well-known}} alchemist, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> example of pseudepigraphy, the practice of giving your works the name of someone else, usually more famous. Though the historical Flamel existed, the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 1612. Flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors, and his entire {{interest in the subject}} revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher's stone. His work spends {{a great deal of time}} describing the processes and reactions, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations. Most of 'his' work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him, especially as regarded the philosopher's stone. Through the 14th and 15th centuries, alchemists were much like Flamel: they concentrated on looking for the philosophers' stone. Bernard Trevisan and George Ripley made similar contributions. Their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art.|$|E
