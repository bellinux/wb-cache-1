25|$|The Type 87 Chi-I had a Type 90 57mm cannon as {{its main}} armament, with one machine {{gun in the}} front hull glacis and another located in a small rear turret. The armour was riveted steel plates with a minimum {{thickness}} of 6mm and a maximum of 17mm. The engine compartment was located {{in the middle of}} the hull and the tank was powered by a V8 gasoline engine. The tank chassis had a complex parallelogram suspension system with two pairs of road <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels</b> per leaf spring arrangement. Hara later designed a bell crank scissors suspension which paired the <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels</b> and connected them to a coil spring mounted horizontally outside the hull. This suspension became standard on the majority of the subsequently designed Japanese tanks and can be seen on the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank and Type 97 Chi-Ha, as examples.|$|E
500|$|In 1871, Wheatley {{followed}} {{these with}} two 4-4-0s, nos. 224 and 264, which were {{built at the}} NBR's Cowlairs locomotive works. These two locomotives formed the 224 Class. A leading bogie was chosen because of the preponderance of sharp curves on the NBR; the <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels</b> were quite small, at [...] diameter, and had solid centres, without spokes. The bogie centre was fixed, {{as opposed to the}} Adams type used later by the NBR, and the bogie wheelbase was [...] The coupled wheels were [...] diameter, and the other principal dimensions were: cylinders [...] diameter by [...] stroke; coupled wheelbase [...]|$|E
500|$|The 224 Class were {{followed}} in 1873 {{by the four}} locomotives of Wheatley's 420 Class, nos. 420–3. These differed from the 224 Class in several respects: the <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels</b> were [...] diameter instead of the coupled wheelbase was [...] instead of the dome was mounted on the boiler barrel instead of the firebox; and the rear wheel splashers were shaped to the wheel instead of being square-topped. They were intended for use on the Waverley route, over which an increase of traffic was anticipated: the Midland Railway (MR) were at the time building their Settle–Carlisle line. This route not yet being open, and the English traffic being entirely {{in the hands of}} the London and North Western Railway who worked closely in tandem with the Caledonian Railway, the NBR's main rival, the trains over the Waverley route were comparatively light and well within the capabilities of the 420 Class.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a new-type <b>bogie</b> <b>wheel</b> and its properties, i. e., <b>bogie</b> <b>wheel</b> with tubular spaced-damping, which has vibration-reducing buffering functions. The mechanic model of <b>bogie</b> <b>wheel</b> based on crawler bulldozer of some type was built. Matlab software {{was used to}} simulate such <b>bogie</b> <b>wheel.</b> The results show that <b>bogie</b> <b>wheel</b> with spaced-damping can effectively buffer the vibration on such bulldozer under different load cases...|$|R
50|$|It {{features}} an elongated Vijayanta Tank's hull with seven <b>Bogie</b> <b>wheel</b> stations, the same {{used for the}} M-46 Catapult integrated to a hydraulically operated bridge laying system.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{suspension}} system uses layered rubber, with pneumatic secondary suspension. The <b>bogie</b> <b>wheel</b> base is 2200 mm (motor bogie) with 820 mm wheels. Braking is by tread brakes, and regenerative braking on power bogies, and by two axle-mounted disc brakes per axle on trailer bogies.|$|R
50|$|The Type 87 Chi-I had {{a complex}} {{parallelogram}} suspension system with {{two pairs of}} road <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels</b> per leaf spring arrangement. Hara designed a bell crank scissors suspension that paired the <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels</b> and connected them to a coil spring mounted horizontally outside the hull. This suspension became standard on {{the majority of the}} subsequently designed Japanese tanks and can be seen on the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank and Type 97 Chi-Ha, as examples.|$|E
50|$|In service, {{difficulty}} was {{experienced with}} the trailing <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels</b> fouling the firebox and {{the heads of}} stays and rivets. This was partially overcome by fitting stops to the engine frame, but this restriction of the sideways movement of the <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels</b> resulted in derailments in tight curves such as on diverging points. The engines performed well at relatively low speeds, but were prone to serious lateral oscillations at higher speeds. Cases of derailment on straight track at speed demonstrated the limitations of a design {{where there was no}} leading carrying wheel to stabilise the engine and considerable overhang of the cylinders.|$|E
5000|$|The Railway Inspectorate {{found that}} the leading axle of the {{locomotive}} had fractured and questioned both {{the use of a}} [...] "goods locomotive" [...] on passenger work, where they would travel at higher speeds than usual, and the locomotive having no leading <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{problems}} with moving such a large heavy weapon, a self-propelled version was made by mounting it on a stretched Heavy Tank T26E3 chassis that had an extra <b>bogie</b> <b>wheel</b> per side as the T92 Howitzer Motor Carriage, but the war ended {{before it could be}} used and was later scrapped.|$|R
50|$|In {{the quest}} for greater {{tactical}} mobility, the Ordnance Department experimented with a self-propelled version. Like the 240 mm howitzer, it was mounted on a stretched Heavy Tank T26E3 chassis that had an extra <b>bogie</b> <b>wheel</b> per side as the 8in Gun Motor Carriage T93, but the war ended before they could be used and were later scrapped.|$|R
50|$|The South African Class 19B, {{numbered}} in {{the range}} from 1401 to 1414, was a later model of the original Class 19 which had been designed in 1928 under the supervision of Colonel F.R. Collins DSO, Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the SAR from 1922 to 1929. It was virtually identical to the Class 19 apart from the wheelbase of the front bogie which had been increased from 6 ft to 6 ft to improve the clearance between the cylinders and the <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels,</b> since the <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels</b> of predecessors Classes 19 and 19A fouled the cylinder covers on sharp curves. The longer wheelbase bogie also facilitated the removal of cylinder covers at running sheds. Because of this difference, the new engines were designated Class 19B.|$|E
50|$|The plant, {{along with}} many in the Oshawa area, was {{critical}} to war supply operations in both World Wars. In the First World War, Ford was supplied with castings. In the Second World War, half of Ontario Malleable's production was occupied with the manufacture of <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels</b> for Bren gun carriers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1930, {{fourteen}} Class 19B locomotives entered service. Built in Germany by Berliner, it {{was virtually}} {{identical to the}} Class 19 apart from the wheelbase of the front bogie, which had been increased from 6 ft to 6 ft to improve the clearance between the cylinders and the <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|E
50|$|From 2 February 2015 Lucchini RS and Unipart Rail {{create a}} new joint venture called LUR (Lucchini Unipart Rail Ltd). The new {{business}} will have an annual turnover of around £60m (about €75m) and employ over 300 people. Both production sites (Manchester and Doncaster) will remain. LUR focuses solely on the traction system of <b>bogies,</b> <b>wheels</b> and axels, wheelsets, gearboxes and final drivers. Lucchini RS holds 60% of LUR.|$|R
50|$|Kim Il-sung's longest train journey {{took place}} in 1984 when he visited almost every socialist country in Eastern Europe. The train ride went via China, through the Soviet Union, with stops in Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Romania. The rest of the trip went through the Soviet Union, again. A second train {{accompanied}} Kim's carrying <b>bogies</b> (<b>wheels</b> and axles) of the other gauge (sizes) needed.|$|R

5000|$|The LSWR 380 {{class was}} {{a class of}} 4-4-0 tender {{locomotives}} designed by William Adams for the London and South Western Railway and introduced about 1879. They were built by Beyer, Peacock and Company and received LSWR numbers 380-391. They were nicknamed [...] "steam rollers" [...] because of their small solid <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels.</b> The design was developed from Adams' 46 class 4-4-0T, later rebuilt as 4-4-2T.|$|E
50|$|By 1932, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was {{producing}} an air-cooled diesel engine that was suitable for tanks. It was placed experimentally into a Type 89. This later {{became known as}} the Type 89-B medium tank. Subsequently, Major Tomio Hara designed the basis of many of the suspensions of future Japanese tanks, the bell crank scissors which had paired <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels</b> connected by a coil spring mounted horizontally outside the hull.|$|E
5000|$|Three <b>bogies</b> or <b>wheel</b> {{assemblies}} {{under the}} unit. Each bogie has two powered axles individually driven by traction motors. See also: Bo-Bo-Bo.|$|R
50|$|Because of this feature, {{railroad}} cars {{intended for}} three-rail operation {{will not work}} on two-rail track unless their wheels are first insulated from each other. Cars intended for two-rail track will operate on three-rail track, {{but they will not}} activate controls wired to an insulated rail. Conversion of three-rail cars for two-rail operation, or vice versa, is thus a common practice among hobbyists. It requires either replacing the <b>bogies</b> (<b>wheel</b> assemblies) on the car, or replacing metal axles with axles made of a non-conductive material.|$|R
50|$|In 1971, {{they came}} out with the Rocket and Lightning models of snowmobiles. These sleds {{combined}} aluminum tunnels with Canadian Curtiss Wright (CCW) engines. The Rocket was a 340, and the Lightning a 400 with electric start. By 1972, Mercury started production of the Hurricane, a more modern snowmobile with optional with slide rail suspension (as opposed to <b>bogie</b> <b>wheel).</b> In 1974 Mercury introduced the Sno-Twister 400cc snowmobile designed primarily for racing. It featured a Kohler free-air engine and succeeded in dominating the 400cc class.|$|R
5000|$|... 20 October 2013: J549 {{undertakes}} {{its first}} test runs {{after completion of}} a 9-year overhaul. During the overhaul the loco received new tyres on the pony truck and coupled wheels, a new smokebox barrel, cylinders re-bored, motion gear re-metaled and the tender <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels</b> re-profiled. The test run included a light engine trial around Maldon yard, followed by a line test to Muckleford and return with Y133. The following week it undertook load tests to Muckleford and Castlemaine.|$|E
50|$|The Type 95 So-Ki was {{an armored}} {{railroad}} {{car of the}} Imperial Japanese Army used for patrolling and guarding railway lines in both Manchuria and Burma. The chassis {{was based on the}} Type 95 Ha-Go Light Tank. The Type 95 So-Ki had light armor and no weapons armament. It had a simple suspension system with <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels</b> suspended on bell cranks {{on each side of the}} chassis. The tracks were driven through the front sprockets. There were three small return wheels.|$|E
50|$|Just to {{the north}} of the viaduct, the Makatote Tramway has a Category 2 listing by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, with {{remnants}} of rails, skid sites, a log hauler, water pits and <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels.</b> In the 1930s Western Red Cedar and Lawson's Cypress were planted near the tramway by the State Forests Service as part of a wider experimental high-altitude planting programme. Japanese Cedar, Douglas Fir, Ponderous Pine, Weymouth Pine and Sugar Pine were also considered for the experiment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{diesel-electric}} locomotives of Class T 448.0 {{are of a}} [...] "hood unit" [...] design, with a full-width cab offset from the centre, with external walkways alongside the long hood housing the engine, riding on two two-axle <b>bogies</b> (<b>wheel</b> arrangement: Bo-Bo) of standard ČKD design. The bogie frame is an H-shaped structure of welded construction, with two TE-005 DC traction motors. The wheelsets are sprung {{with a pair of}} helical springs and dampened by a pair of parallel shock absorbers. The gear ratio is 78:15.|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were built}} as two-cylinder compounds using the Worsdell-von Borries system, having an 18 in high-pressure cylinder and a 26 in diameter low-pressure cylinder, each with 24 in stroke. Inside Walschaerts valve gear was fitted which was standard on the BNCR. The driving wheels were of 6 ft diameter. The only visible {{difference between the}} two builders was the number of spokes on the <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels,</b> the Belfast-built batch had nine spokes while those built at Derby had ten.|$|E
50|$|The outside {{frames of}} the Dukes were curved upwards over {{each pair of}} driving wheels. Inner and outer frames were 3/4 in thick. The first 40 {{members of the class}} were fitted with Mansell pattern <b>bogie</b> <b>wheels</b> with wooden centres. The first 25 tenders built also had Mansell pattern wheels, and a shorter than normal {{wheelbase}} of 11 ft so that the locomotives would fit on the smaller turntables then in use west of Newton Abbot. The engine bogie was of a centre-less type designed by Dean.|$|E
50|$|A Project has {{now been}} {{launched}} {{to build a new}} member of this class (No. 567) to modern engineering standards (using metric steel and specifications) for running on the Great Central Railway (preserved). It will be a semi-new build locomotive, with a potential boiler, cylinder block and tender chassis already found, and the rest costing about £450,000. The <b>Bogie</b> <b>wheels</b> are identical to those on the 'Brighton Atlantic Project', so the pattern for these could be utilised (courtesy of the Bluebell Railway) - other new-build projects based on Kitson design/manufacture may also have useful parts.|$|E
5000|$|Two <b>bogies</b> or <b>wheel</b> {{assemblies}} {{under the}} unit. Each bogie has one powered axle, one idle axle, {{and one more}} powered axle. All powered axles are individually driven by traction motors.|$|R
5000|$|They {{differed}} {{little from}} the prototype; the <b>bogie</b> <b>wheel</b> diameter {{had been reduced}} by two inches from 3 ft to 3 ft and the valve setting amended to give an increased travel of 7.5 in. The overall weight of the locomotive had increased by [...] to [...] but a tractive effort of 27275 lbf kN compared favourably with the 24935 lbf kN of the 'Saint'. The original locomotives were built with Churchward 3500 imp gal tenders but after 4958 Collett's larger 4000 imp gal types became standard although a few later locomotives were fitted with smaller tenders if these were available as they entered service.|$|R
