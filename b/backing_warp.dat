An S-twist thread is out on the front warp (right warp) and a Z- twist on the <b>back</b> <b>warp</b> (left warp, reverse warp). All the warp ends pass through a sley with {{individual}} perforations- to keep the threads from tangling.On a machine with 3000 front warp ends, that will mean 6000 perforations, all front warp ends will be of the same count, and all <b>back</b> <b>warp</b> ends will be of the same count, though the two warps can carry different counts. The warp threads interact with the brass bobbin threads to form the net or openwork ground. The reverse warp threads (introduced in 1830) lock the front warp threads against the bobbin threads. The warp threads are tensioned by a spring.|$|R

50|$|Beams are the {{vertical}} threads from a beam roller {{that contributes to}} the pattern. Lace is made up of motif that is repeated vertically and horizontally. If a design has 48 horizontal repeats, there will be 48 threads on each beam roller. Every beam roller has its own guidebar, made of thin watch-spring steel. Each front warp ends has its own guidebar. The <b>back</b> <b>warp</b> ends share 4 stump bars between them. The guide bars are controlled by the Jacquards so can be reposition for each motion, indeed they are also known as Jacquard bars; they are held in a bar box above the sley but below the carriages.|$|R

50|$|Kersey yarns were spun {{in large}} gauges (thicknesses) from {{inferior}} carded wool, and made thick and sturdy cloth. Kersey was a warp-backed, twill-weave cloth woven on a four-treadle loom. As a rule, half the relatively small, numerous and closely set warp ends threads were struck {{with a big}} kersey weft in a two-and-two, unbalanced and highly prominent twill. The rest of the ends were simultaneously struck in a one-and-three twill, so they appeared mainly {{on the back of}} the cloth, while the back-warp stitches on the face of the cloth were concealed among the face-warp threads. One of the secrets of weaving a good kersey lay in combining the adequate stitching of the weft by the <b>back</b> <b>warp</b> with the concealment of the back-warp stitches.The back of the cloth was napped and shorn after fulling, producing a dense, warm fabric with a smooth back.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{tension of}} {{warp and weft}} run through the whole weaving process in knitted carpet weaving equipment. The {{performance}} of delivering warp mechanism and guiding weft mechanism {{in this kind of}} equipment influences the quality of carpet directly. A self-adjusting delivering warp mechanism is designed in this thesis, which is used in knitted carpet weaving equipment or other textile equipment that delivers warp by warp-spindle and demands even warp tension. The self-adjusting delivering warp mechanism consists of the device for setting and detecting warp tension, the device for driving warp-spindle in different speed, and the device for transmitting warp-spindle movement. The device for setting and detecting warp tension can determine initialization tension of warp, according to the technical requirements, can detect and feed <b>back</b> <b>warp</b> tension in real time. The device for driving warp-spindle in different speed makes the rotating speed of warp-spindle change according to the warp tension. The self-adjusting delivering warp mechanism realizes the function on controlling the rotating speed of warp-spindle in closed loop, and on stabilizing delivering warp tension...|$|R

5000|$|Once in the {{physical}} realm, daemons are often found fighting alongside Chaos worshippers- mainly {{the forces of the}} Chaos Space Marines, but also Chaos-influenced Imperial Guard and rebels known as the Lost and the Damned. Less frequently, other races such as the Orks (it is hard to tell) or Eldar can be corrupted by the Chaos Gods. When this happens, they too can be seen fighting alongside daemons, although not necessarily those of the four major gods. Like Fantasy daemons, they are sometimes difficult for physical weapons to destroy, but certain specially prepared weapons do exist which can more easily defeat them, banishing them <b>back</b> to the <b>Warp</b> (or even obliterating them from existence); like their Fantasy counterparts, if they are defeated in combat, the power holding them in {{the physical}} universe can begin to fade, banishing them <b>back</b> to the <b>warp.</b> (On a side note, the current release of the Codex: Chaos Space Marines has removed the [...] "instability" [...] rule, thus daemons are no longer in danger of dissipating in battle.) ...|$|R

The trilogy adds new features across all three games, including unified checkpoints, pause menus and save systems, including both manual and automatic saving, time trials, which were first introduced in Warped, and the ability to play most levels in each game as Crash's sister Coco. It also features remastered audio and cutscenes, featuring newly recorded dialogue from past voice actors from the franchise.|$|R
