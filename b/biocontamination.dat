40|$|The {{biological}} pressure {{represented by}} non-indigenous macroinvertebrate species (NIMS) {{should be addressed}} {{in the implementation of}} EU Water Framework Directive as this can have a direct impact on the ’naturalness’ of the invaded macroinvertebrate assemblage. The <b>biocontamination</b> concept allows assessment of this deviation from naturalness, by evaluation of abundance and disparity contamination of an assemblage. This study aimed to assess the <b>biocontamination</b> of macroinvertebrate assemblages in Lithuanian rivers, thereby revealing the most high-impact non-indigenous species, and to explore the relationship between <b>biocontamination</b> and conventional metrics of ecological quality. Most of the studied rivers appeared to be impacted by NIMS. The amphipods Pontogammarus robustoides, Chelicorophium curvispinum and snail Litoglyphus naticoides were revealed as high-impact NIMS for Lithuanian lotic systems. Metrics of ecological quality which largely depend upon the richness of indicator taxa, such as the biological monitoring working party (BMWP) score and Ephemeroptera/Plecoptera/Trichoptera (EPT) taxa number, were negatively correlated with <b>biocontamination,</b> implying they could provide unreliable ecological quality estimates when NIMS are present. Routine macroinvertebrate water quality monitoring data are sufficient for generation of the <b>biocontamination</b> assessment and thus can provide supplementary information, with minimal extra expense or effort. We therefore recommend that <b>biocontamination</b> assessment is included alongside established methods for gauging biological and chemical water quality...|$|E

40|$|Background: Water and High Purity Water (HPW) {{distribution}} {{systems can}} be contaminated with human pathogenic microorganisms. This <b>biocontamination</b> may pose a risk to human health as HPW is commonly used in the industrial, pharmaceutical and clinical sectors. Currently, routine microbiological testing of HPW is performed using slow and labour intensive traditional microbiological based techniques. There {{is a need to}} develop a rapid culture independent methodology to quantitatively detect and identify <b>biocontamination</b> associated with HPW. Results: A novel internally controlled 5 -plex real-time PCR Nucleic Acid Diagnostics assay (NAD), was designed and optimised in accordance with Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments guidelines, to rapidly detect, identify and quantify the human pathogenic bacteriaStenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescenswhich are commonly associated with the <b>biocontamination</b> of water and water distribution systems. The specificity of the 5 -plex assay was tested against genomic DNA isolated from a panel of 95 microorganisms with no cross reactivity observed. The analytical sensitivities of the S. maltophilia, B. cepacia, P. aeruginosa and the S. marcescens assays are 8. 5, 5. 7, 3. 2 and 7. 4 genome equivalents respectively. Subsequently, an analysis of HPW supplied by a Millipore Elix 35 water purification unit performed using standard microbiological methods revealed high levels of naturally occurring microbiological contamination. Five litre water samples from this HPW delivery system were also filtered and genomic DNA was purified directly from these filters.

40|$|Harbours, {{which are}} often characterised by {{anthropogenic}} stress in combination with intensive international ship traffic, {{tend to be very}} susceptible to aquatic invasions. Since alien macrocrustaceans are known to be very successful across many European waters, a study was made on their distribution and impact in the four Belgian coastal harbours (Nieuwpoort, Ostend, Blankenberge and Zeebrugge). Biological and physical–chemical data were gathered at 43 sampling sites distributed along a salinity gradient in the four harbours. One-fourth of all crustacean species recorded were alien and represented on average 30 % of the total macrocrustacean abundance and 65 % of the total macrocrustacean biomass. The large share of alien crustaceans in the total macrocrustacean biomass was mainly due to several large alien crab species. Most alien species were found in the oligohaline zone, whereas the number of indigenous species slightly increased with increasing salinity. The low number of indigenous species present at low salinities was probably not only caused by salinity, but also by the lower water quality in this salinity range. Based on the site-specific <b>biocontamination</b> index (SBCI), which was used to assess the ecological water quality, the harbour of Nieuwpoort and Ostend scored best and were classified as good, indicating the limited abundance and the low number of alien macrocrustaceans. Sampling locations situated more inland generally had a higher SBCI and a lower ecological water quality. Zeebrugge and Blankenberge were characterised by a severe <b>biocontamination.</b> For Zeebrugge, this is probably related to the intensive transcontinental commercial ship traffic, whereas for Blankenberge, this could be due to introduction of alien species via recreational crafts or due to its geographical location in the proximity of Zeebrugge. Consistent monitoring of estuarine regions and harbours, which are seen as hotspots for introductions, could help in understanding and predicting the impact of alien species on native biota...|$|E

The methods and procedures currently implemented for detecting <b>biocontamination</b> in direct product environments are highly time-consuming and labor-intensive.

For this reason, a Sensor system is currently being developed at the Fraunhofer IPA for detecting biotic contamination by stimulating a specific fluorescence of universal cell contents.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} decades, surface <b>biocontamination</b> {{has become a}} major concern in food {{industries}} and medical environments where its outcomes could vary from financial losses to public health issues. Understanding adhesion mechanisms of involved microorganisms is essential to develop new strategies of prevention and control. Adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a nosocomial pathogenic bacterium, relies on several bacterial features, amongst which are bacterial appendages such as flagella and type IV pili. Here, we examine the role of P. aeruginosa PAO 1 flagella and type IV pili in the adhesion to abiotic surfaces with various hydrophobicities. Adhesion kinetics showed, that after 60 min, flagella increased the adhesion of the strain to surfaces with high hydrophobicity while no effect was observed on hydrophilic surfaces. Flagella of adherent bacteria exhibited specific and conserved pattern on the surfaces that suggested a higher affinity of flagella for hydrophobic surfaces. Based on these results and on previous studies in the literature, we proposed a model of flagella-mediated adhesion onto hydrophobic surfaces where these appendages induce the first contact and promote the adhesion of the bacterial body. These findings suggest that anti-bioadhesive surface design should take into consideration the presence of bacterial appendages...|$|E

No significant difference between the samplers was observed for the mold concentrations on Sabouraud agar, whereas Sampl'Air collected significantly more bacteria on tryptic soy agar than Air Ideal or BACTair at one of the sites. Impactor location in the room was nevertheless associated with the variability observed with the three samplers at the highest microbial concentration levels.

40|$|<b>Biocontamination</b> {{control is}} a very {{significant}} part of the manufacturing process of sterile drugs. Sterility is frequently monitored by active or passive air sampling measurements, but there are no specific rules as to how this is to be done. This study tested air sampling methods of active impaction and passive sedimentation under standardized conditions. Aspergillus niger (A. niger) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were selected in this experiment to examine parallels, correlations and differences between the two methods. The results show that the number of colony forming units per plate (CFU/plate) was higher for A. niger in the active method, whereas for S. aureus it was higher in the sedimentation method. A high correlation coefficient was found between the impaction and sedimentation methods for A. niger. For S. aureus, depending on the culture media used and the time for passive air sampling, a larger number of CFU/plate was found than in active air sampling. This study concludes that active and passive air sampling can be used for monitoring the air in clean rooms. For fungal spore detection, the impaction is more efficient, as it is possible to sample a higher volume of air in a shorter period of time, whereas the optimal measurement methods for S. aureus depend on a number of factors...|$|E

Air samples from incubation chambers were adsorbed on Tenax TA and dinitrophenylhydrazine cartridges and were analyzed by thermal desorption-gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. Metabolic activity was measured by determining CO 2 production, and microbial concentrations were determined by a dilution plate method. At 80 to 82 % RH, CO 2 production did not indicate that microbial activity occurred, and only 10 % of the spores germinated, while slight increases in the concentrations of some VOCs were detected. All of the parameters showed that microbial activity occurred at 90 to 99 % RH. The microbiological analyses revealed weak microbial growth even under drying conditions (32 to 33 % RH). The main VOCs produced on the building materials studied were 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol, 1 -pentanol, 1 -hexanol, and 1 -octen- 3 -ol. In some cases fungal growth decreased aldehyde emissions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess, for the first time, the {{presence}} of muramic acid (Mur) and 3 -hydroxy fatty acids (3 -OH FAs), chemical markers for terrestrial bacteria in "curated" lunar samples by use of state-of-the-art gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The Apollo lunar sample collection has been stored, under isolation conditions, at the Johnson Space Center since 1969. Markers were absent in three of the four samples analyzed. However, one sample clearly contained markers for Earth bacteria (83 - 469 ppb for 3 -OH FAs and 156 ppb for Mur). The bacterial markers were present at several orders of magnitude higher levels in terrestrial dust (7. 6 - 36. 9 X 10 (3) ppb for 3 -OH FAs and 125. 3 X 10 (3) ppb for Mur). The lunar sample containing markers consisted of dust rinsed from flight hardware, suggesting terrestrial <b>biocontamination</b> as the source. In conclusion, pristine lunar dust is strikingly different from terrestrial dust in lacking chemical markers for terrestrial bacteria. It is suggested that future life detection studies of other samples of extraterrestrial origin (e. g., from Mars) might be greatly aided by concurrent analysis of chemical markers for terrestrial bacteria and by including pristine lunar dust to provide a negative baseline...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe <b>biocontamination</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{problems}} in various industrial sectors, specifically in medicine and environment fields. It has been shown that surface characteristics of materials, such as superhydrophobic character, can allow obtaining " antibioadhesive " surfaces. Indeed, the wetting is reduced which may favor the "sliding" of the aqueous medium on the surface. Hence, its ability to interact with bacteria may also be reduced. This phenomenon is associated with the chemical functionality of the coating and its nano-roughness, in order to not mechanically trap the bacteria. Here, such anti-bioadhesive surfaces are designed from polyethylene terephtalate (PET) by three steps plasma-treatment. First, the nano-roughness is created by oxygen plasma-treatment with controlled dimensions. Then, the plasma-treated polymeric surface was hydrophobized with a tetrafluorocarbon plasma, allowing to obtain a water contact angle of 145 ± 4 °. However, the SEM pictures give evidence of show the degradation of the structuration caused by the CF 4 -plasma and consequently, the superhydrophobicity was not reached. Thus, a plasma-polypyrrole layer was deposited before the plasma-fluorination, which has a protective role against the degradation generated by fluorinated species, preserving the structuration and improving the fluorination rate. Therefore, the obtained surfaces are superhydrophobic with water contact angle of 157 ± 2 ° and a hysteresis of 65 ± 3 °. The ability of these surfaces to reduce bioadhesion will be performed in further work...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} the mode of contamination in relation with the nature of solid substrates on the resistance of spores of Bacillus atrophaeus -selected as surrogates of Bacillus anthracis- to a disinfectant, peracetic acid. Methods and Results: Six materials confronted in urban and military environments were selected for their different structural and physicochemical properties. In parallel, two modes of contamination were examined, i. e. deposition and immersion. Deposition was used to simulate contamination by an aerosol and immersion by an extended contact with liquids. A pronounced difference in the <b>biocontamination</b> levels and spatial organization of spores was observed depending on the mode of contamination {{and the nature of the}} solid substrate considered, with consequences on decontamination. Contamination by immersion led to lower efficiency of peracetic acid decontamination than contamination by deposition. Infiltration of spores into porous materials after immersion is one reason. In contrast, the deposition mode aggregates cells at the surface of materials, explaining the similar disinfecting behaviour of porous and nonporous substrates when considering this inoculation route. Conclusions: The inoculation route was shown to be as influential a parameter as material characteristics (porosity and wettability) for decontamination efficacy. Significance and Impact of the Study: These results provide comparative information for the decontamination of B. atrophaeus spores in function of the mode of contamination and the nature of solid substrates...|$|E
40|$|RIDA®COUNT test {{plates were}} used as an easy-to-handle and rapid {{indicator}} of microbial counts in karst ecosystems of several caves in Slovakia and Slovenia. All of the caves had a high organic input from water streams, tourists, roosting bat colonies or terrestrial surroundings. We sampled swabs, water and air samples to test robustness and universality of the RIDA®COUNT test kit (R-Biopharm AG, Germany, [URL] for quantification of total bacteria, coliforms, yeast and mold. Using data from swabs (colony-forming units CFU per cm 2) we proposed a scale for description of <b>biocontamination</b> level or superficial microbial load of cave niches. Based on this scale, surfaces of Ardovská Cave, Drienovská Cave and Stará Brzotínská Cave (Slovakia) were moderately colonized by microbes, with total microbial counts (sum of total bacterial count and total yeast and molds count) {{in the range of}} 1, 001 - 10, 000 CFU/ 100 cm 2, while some surfaces from the show cave Postojna Cave (Slovenia) can be considered highly colonized by microbes (total microbial counts ≥ 10, 001 CFU/ 100 cm 2). Ardovská Cave also had a high concentration of airborne microbes, which can be explained by restricted air circulation and regular bat activity. The ratio of coliform to total counts of bacteria in the 9 km of underground Pivka River flow in Postojna Cave dropped approximately 4 -fold from the entrance, indicating the high anthropogenic pollution in the most exposed site in the show cave. The RIDA®COUNT test kit was proven to be applicable for regular monitoring of eutrophication and human influence in eutrophic karst caves...|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, it is {{tried in}} this paper to study the effect of two {{nanoparticles}} in water-base drilling-typical fluid. Specifically, {{the effect of this}} matter on the yield point (YP) and consistency index (k) and flow behavior index (n) was examined to improve cement-contaminated cement during drilling operation. Decreasing the flow behavior index by adding nanofumed silica in base fluid is among the results of the test. Cementing operation was of drilling steps employed several times to strengthen casing pipes. So, cement contaminations are avoidable in drilling. Silica (silicate mud) is a drilling fluid that matter used for specific purposes including being economic, lower <b>biocontamination,</b> better thermal and pressure stability, lubricating drilling pipes and shale prevention. Regarding each typical drilling costs of each foot and importance of time in the operation, it is possible to replace technically and economically the ordinary addition (here, the widely used sodium hydroxide) with fumed silica nanoparticles in drilling fluid to improve cement-contaminated drilling fluid. One of the nano-TiO 2 matter advantages is possessing suitable thermal transition qualities in drilling fluid. In drilling mud composition, there are a series of solid particles making electrochemical bounds with other liquid-phase matters. The resistance the matters show against cut is called yield point the unit; on the other hand, the point expresses viscosity and electrostatic forces between particles. In laminar flow, lines are parallel; mud moves in separate parallel layers with different velocities and passes through ring spaces or pipes. With the increase, flow velocities get closer in different layers. Displacement of mud is more difficult with slow flow because drilling particles tend to layers with low velocity and move in the layers and cause low velocity in the layers, their displacement gets harder. One way to avoid the problem is to increase the yield point.|$|E
40|$|Prior to {{deploying}} bi-directional probes {{that will}} return to Earth samples from the atmosphere, surface and subsurface of Mars, {{it is essential to}} fully appreciate the risks and impacts of possible <b>biocontamination</b> to planetary ecosystems on both Earth and Mars. NASA’s present planetary protection policy (PPP) stems from: “Biological Contamination of Mars: Issues and Recommendations”, the recommendations of the NRC’s Space Studies Board, and is a weak and outdated policy that fails to adequately ensure protection of either Earth or Mars. This {{is due to the fact}} that this policy downplays the likelihood of finding life on Mars, discovering organisms that would also prove viable on Earth, and grossly underestimating the potential outcome of interactions between these seemingly disparate organisms and ecosystems. In light of mounting evidence which suggests the potential, past or present, for the existence of life on Mars – given by the suggestive results of ALH 84001, a growing appreciation for the breadth of tenuous conditions under which extremophiles exist on Earth and, perhaps most importantly, the recent evidence from NASA suggesting the existence of liquid water near the surface of Mars – this paper calls for the implementation of a stricter PPP for the transfer and handling of samples derived from Mars. In contrast to NASA’s present PPP, this paper argues that there are several significant ecosystems on Earth with the potential to be seriously impacted by the introduction of xenoterrestrial organisms. Thus, this platform aims to raise the awareness of the necessity to achieve a unilateral policy ensuring necessary care in handling samples returned from Mars by highlighting possible sources and routes of contamination to both planets and discussing methods for ensuring adequate segregation and evaluation of these samples, as well as the impact and management of a contaminating event...|$|E
