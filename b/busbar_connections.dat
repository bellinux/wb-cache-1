40|$|We {{study the}} {{transport}} of a quantum particle through square lattices of various sizes by employing the tight-binding Hamiltonian from quantum percolation. Input and output semi-infinite chains {{are attached to the}} lattice either by diagonal point to point contacts or by a <b>busbar</b> <b>connection.</b> We find resonant transmission and reflection occuring whenever the incident particle's energy is near an eigenvalue of the lattice alone (i. e., the lattice without the chains attached). We also find the transmission to be strongly dependent on the way the chains are attached to the lattice. Comment: 4 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
40|$|After the {{research}} for years, the automatic generation method of the switching orders for single substation is gradually matured, {{but it is}} still difficult to establish a versatile generation method of switching orders for multi-substations because of the high complexity dimensions of the tasks. Here, it is pointed out that de-coupling the problem of versatile generation for switching order the complexity can be reduced, then the generation of switching orders for multi-substations can be implemented. Storing the heuristic rules of generating the switching orders for different voltage sides (load side or receiving side), different <b>busbar</b> <b>connection</b> diagram and different switching tasks by database of cases, after the versatile switching order problem is de-coupled the switching orders of special operation for special bus type at special voltage class can be generated by the inference rules of switching order stored in each case database. Using the case database established for 13 substations that belong to a certain power bureau, the versatile switching orders for 39 substation in 110 kV and higher power networks are generated by the versatile switching order generation system developed by the given method.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sandia Laboratories is {{performing}} modeling and {{analysis on the}} causes of solar arc fault failures and fires. As part of this work, recent module failures (modules ~ 6 years in service) at a large photovoltaic power plant in the southwest United States have been documented, and the failure modes determined through physics based analysis. The analysis and modeling indicates that arc faults within the module are likely {{the cause of the}} observed failures. Failed or failing solder <b>connections</b> between the <b>busbars</b> and connector ribbons, and connector ribbons and the backside contacts are the common theme in these failures. Electrical modeling shows that an interconnect ribbon to <b>busbar</b> <b>connection</b> that has separated by 5 microns (through either diurnal cycling or corrosion) can experience a sufficient electric field driven by just the module voltage, to cause an arc flash. Further thermo-mechanical modeling shows that a mere 0. 4 mm 2 arc region can generate heat energy sufficient to shatter the glass, burn off (volatilize or boil) the copper busbar’s tin coating, as well as char the other materials used in a solar module stack, all within the millisecond to 2 second time frame...|$|R
40|$|Toroidal field (TF) and poloidal field (PF) {{coils of}} {{steady-state}} superconducting tokamak (SST- 1) have been fully refurbished to ensure cryostable and low-dc-resistance interpancake and intercoil joints, helium leak tightness of the winding pack, and 3 ̆e 10 MΩ winding pack to ground insulation resistance under cold conditions. As per SST- 1 mission mandate, all TF coils and PF 3 Top had been cold tested at full operational parameters. A dedicated large coil test facility was integrated for these tests. Specially adapted solutions such as magnet preparation cum transport stand, demountable busbar supports, demountable sensor mountings, reusable joints for <b>busbar</b> <b>connections</b> inside cryostat, etc., were developed. These measures led to timely and {{successful completion of}} cold tests and integration of the magnet system on to the SST- 1 machine shell. The functionality of various diagnostics of the magnet system was also established during these tests.

40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) {{prototype}} test string- 1, hereafter {{referred to}} as the string, is composed of three ten-meter long prototype dipole magnets and one six-meter long prototype quadrupole magnet. The magnets are immersed in a pressurized static bath of superfluid helium that is maintained at a pressure of about 1 bar and at a temperature of about 1. 9 K. This helium bath constitutes one single hydraulic unit, extending along the 42. 5 m of the string length. We have measured the triggering of quenches of the string magnets due to the quenching of a single dipole magnet located at the string's extremity; i. e. "quench propagation". Previously reported measurements enabled to establish that in this configuration the quench propagation is mediated by the helium and not by the inter-magnet <b>busbar</b> <b>connections</b> [1], [2]. We present a model of helium mediated quench propagation based on the qualitative conclusions of these two previous papers, and on additional information gained from a dedicated series of quench propagation measurements that were not previously reported. We will discuss the specific mechanisms and their main parameters involved at different time scales of the propagation process, and apply the model to make quantitative predictions...|$|E
40|$|In recent times, {{electromagnetic}} emissions from various electrical components have induced {{more than one}} debate whether they represent a harmful influence to our health. In addition, interferences caused by power frequency magnetic fields (PFMFs) on electron beam based electronic equipment (e. g. cathode ray tubes found in TV screens and computer monitors, electron microscopes) become evident at levels over 1 microtesla. These issues have caused some concern with the general public {{but also to the}} utilities, their customers and the electromagnetic compatibility community. On the other hand, they have also spurred efforts to study and mitigate these fields. Although most published studies and debates are concerned with fields from power transmission lines, similar levels of PFMFs {{can be found in a}} city neighbourhood. For this reason this study focuses on the fields originating from the last stages of the power network before reaching the customer, in particular the components of in-house secondary substations. However the methods developed in this study can also be applied more generally. Conductive and ferromagnetic shielding, passive and active compensation and other techniques are described. These techniques make use of modern methods of analysis such as algebraic computing and 2 D/ 3 D modelling. It was found that shielding using thin conductive plates and a proper design can provide for cost-effective mitigation of PFMFs. It was shown that the choice of either ferromagnetic or conductive shielding is dependant on a number of variables, which can only be determined by a proper 2 D or 3 D modelling. It was also found that cable and <b>busbar</b> <b>connections</b> and not the transformers are the main cause of large PFMF emission from substations. These and other results were applied to actual cases where the measured values were considered as problematic, or where low emission was a requirement already at the design stages...|$|E

This leads to non-ideal converter operation, namely voltage overshoot, voltage drop and resonance with snubber capacitors. By analyzing the currents and fields in and around busbars, parasitic inductance can be predicted and limited. Conference Pape...|$|R

50|$|The main coil is {{the outer}} part of the line trap which is made from {{stranded}} aluminum cable. The reactor coil, depending on the device, {{can be made up}} of several aluminum wires, allowing equal distribution amongst the parallel wires. The stranded aluminum coil is wound in one layer. However, when the application of more than one layer is necessary, separation between layers is required to provide a cooling duct between them to avoid overheating. The cooling duct is created with spacer bars made out of epoxy resin and fiberglass. The coil carries rated continuous power frequency currents, therefore this is the power inductor in this system. It provides a low impedance path for the electricity flow. Since the power flow is rather large at times, the coil used in a line trap must be large in terms of physical size. Hence, a line trap unit is inserted between the <b>busbar</b> and <b>connection</b> of coupling capacitor to the line. It is a parallel tuned circuit containing inductance and capacitance. It has low impedance for power frequency and high impedance to carrier frequency. This unit prevents the high frequency carrier signal from entering the neighboring line.|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} of a particle through disordered clusters {{can be treated}} either classically or quantum mechanically, {{depending on the size}} of the systems involved. In this thesis we employ both treatments. ^ In the classical part we extend ordinary site percolation on a square lattice to fully coordinated (FC) percolation and to iterated fully coordinated (IFC) percolation models. FC percolation comes about by adding a full coordination requirement to ordinary site percolation. In IFC percolation we iterate this requirement one more time. We find all three models to belong to the same universality class. We also find a developing Euclidean signature as we iterate the models from ordinary to FC and then to IFC percolation. ^ In the quantum part we study the transmittance of a particle traversing through square lattices and through disordered clusters. The square lattices and disordered clusters are attached to two semi-infinite chains serving as the input and output leads. The leads and the clusters are coupled together through either point to point contacts or <b>busbar</b> <b>connections.</b> In transport through square lattices we find resonant transmission and reflection whenever the energy of the incident particle is close to a doubly-degenerate eigenvalue of the uncoupled lattice. We also find the transmission to be sensitive to the type of coupling chosen. In transport through disordered clusters we find the transmission to decrease as the clusters become larger. This hints that states are localized. Furthermore, we find the transmission to be independent of the coupling chosen in the presence of strong disorder. This independence is lost in weakly disordered clusters. We also find hints of localized-to-localized transitions as we vary the degree of disorder. However, the clusters we have been studying are still too small to make definite conclusions. We thus find it necessary to extend our analyses to larger-sized clusters. ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{television}} stations, recording studios, {{and other}} installations where signal quality is critical, a special signal ground {{known as a}} [...] "technical ground" [...] (or [...] "technical earth", [...] "special earth", and [...] "audio earth") is often installed, to prevent ground loops. This is basically {{the same thing as}} an AC power ground, but no general appliance ground wires are allowed any connection to it, as they may carry electrical interference. For example, only audio equipment is connected to the technical ground in a recording studio. In most cases, the studio's metal equipment racks are all joined together with heavy copper cables (or flattened copper tubing or <b>busbars)</b> and similar <b>connections</b> are made to the technical ground. Great care is taken that no general chassis grounded appliances are placed on the racks, as a single AC ground connection to the technical ground will destroy its effectiveness. For particularly demanding applications, the main technical ground may consist of a heavy copper pipe, if necessary fitted by drilling through several concrete floors, such that all technical grounds may be connected by the shortest possible path to a grounding rod in the basement.|$|R
40|$|With {{more and}} more {{renewable}} energy generation (REG) <b>connections,</b> <b>busbar</b> voltage violation and line overloading problems may occur for some parts of a distribution network. However, building new circuits to accommodate REG may have high monetary and environmental costs. This paper considers distribution automation as a supplementary scheme to traditional primary asset investments and analyzes the operational benefits from introducing an autonomous regional active network management system (AuRA-NMS) to a practical distribution system with rich renewable sources. The benefits are quantified in terms of optimal power flow control and investment deferral, and the resulting quantification will inform distribution network operators of the trade-offs between investment in the automation system and in the primary assets, thus helping them to make cost-effective investment decisions. Time-series-based simulation for over an entire year is implemented to calculate the benefits of active power loss and curtailment reductions for AuRA-NMS over the current practice. Part I of this paper illustrates the current schemes for voltage control and constraint management, advanced voltage control and constraint management enabled by the distribution automation, and the annual benefit by introducing the AuRA-NMS to the system with different considerable new DG integrations. Part II analyzes the investment deferral benefit by deploying AuRA-NMS...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} hopping {{transport}} of a quantum particle through finite, randomly diluted percolation clusters in two dimensions. We investigate how the transmission coefficient T behaves {{as a function}} of the energy E of the particle, the occupation concentration p of the disordered cluster, the size of the underlying lattice, and the type of connection chosen between the cluster and the input and output leads. We investigate both the point-to-point contacts and the <b>busbar</b> type of <b>connection.</b> For highly diluted clusters we find the behavior of the transmission to be independent of the type of connection. As the amount of dilution is decreased we find sharp variations in transmission. These variations are the remnants of the resonances at the ordered, zero-dilution, limit. For particles with energies within 0. 25 <= E <= 1. 75 (relative to the hopping integral) and with underlying square lattices of size 20 x 20, the configurations begin transmitting near p_a = 0. 60 with T against p curves following a common pattern as the amount of dilution is decreased. Near p_b = 0. 90 this pattern is broken and the transmission begins to vary with the energy. In the asymptotic limit of very large clusters we find the systems to be totally reflecting except when the amount of dilution is very low and when the particle has energy close to a resonance value at the ordered limit or when the particle has energy at the middle of the band.
