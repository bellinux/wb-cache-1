The gene for a second sRNA, SurC, located in the region between dnaJ and dnaK, was switched on at a late stage of sporulation by the RNA polymerase sigma factor σK, which directs gene transcription in the mother cell compartment of the developing sporangium. Finally, a third intergenic region, that between polC and ylxS, which specified several sRNAs, including two transcripts produced {{under the control of the}} forespore-specific sigma factor σG and a third transcript generated by σK, was identified.

Here we use atomic force microscopy (AFM) with tips <b>bearing</b> specific <b>probes</b> (lectins, antibodies) to analyze the major glycopolymers of pathogenic and non-pathogenic yeast cells at molecular resolution. We show that non-ubiquitous b- 1, 2 -mannans are largely exposed on the surface of native cells from pathogenic Candida albicans and C. glabrata, the former species displaying the highest glycopolymer density and extensions. We also find that chitin, a major component of the inner layer of the yeast cell wall, is much more abundant in C. albicans. These differences in molecular properties, further supported by flow cytometry measurements, may play an important role in strengthening cell wall mechanics and immune interactions.

The structure-affinity relationship study suggests the existence of a certain degree of conformational freedom of the amino acid residues interacting with the substituents in positions 3 and 4 of the quipazine quinoline nucleus. Thus, the tacrine-related heterobivalent ligand 6 o was designed in an attempt to capitalize on the evidence of such a steric tolerance. Compound 6 o shows a nanomolar potency for both the 5 -HT 3 receptor and the human AChE and represents the first example of a rationally designed high-affinity 5 -HT 3 receptor ligand showing nanomolar AChE inhibitory activity. Finally, the computational analysis performed on compound 6 o allowed the rationalization of the structure-energy determinants for AChE versus BuChE selectivity and revealed the existence of a subsite at the boundary of the 5 -HT 3 receptor extracellular domain, which could represent a peripheral site similar to that evidenced in the AChE gorge...|$|R

In contrast, neither the omission of calcium ions nor the addition of 0. 5 microM tetrodotoxin affected dialysate 5 -HT or 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA). Reserpine did not decrease the output of 5 -HT and 5 -HIAA 24 h later and p-chloroamphetamine increased 5 -HT in both vehicle- and reserpine-treated rats severalfold. 8 -Hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT), at 1 or 10 microM, perfused into the raphe did not change the outputs of 5 -HT or 5 -HIAA. Higher doses (0. 1, 1, and 10 mM) increased extracellular 5 -HT in the raphe, probably via an inhibition of uptake. In animals <b>bearing</b> two <b>probes</b> (raphe nuclei and ventral hippocampus), only the 10 mM dose of 8 -OH-DPAT perfused into the raphe decreased the hippocampal output of 5 -HT and 5 -HIAA. The systemic injection of 0. 1 mg/kg 8 -OH-DPAT decreased dialysate 5 -HT and 5 -HIAA in the raphe and hippocampus. These results suggest that extracellular 5 -HT in raphe nuclei originates from a cytoplasmic pool and is not dependent on either nerve impulse of 5 -HT neurons or local activation of 5 -HT 1 A receptors.

However, ThnY showed substitutions in highly conserved positions of the pyridine nucleotide binding domain of these ferredoxin reductases. ThnY expression is co-regulated with all other genes required for tetralin biodegradation, and presumably thnY is part of the thnCA 3 A 4 RY operon. ThnY has been purified, and its biochemical and functional properties were characterized. ThnY was found to be a monomeric orange-brown iron-sulfur flavoprotein (estimated mass of 37, 000 Da) containing one non-covalently attached flavin adenine dinucleotide and one plant type ferredoxin 2 Fe- 2 S cluster.

Snap-to-it probes were prepared from peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligomers by modifying each terminus with a coordinating ligand. The two coordinating ligands constrain the probe into a macrocyclic configuration through formation of an intramolecular chelate with a divalent transition metal ion. On hybridization with a DNA target, the intramolecular chelate in the snap-to-it probe dissociates, resulting in the probe ‘snapping-to’ and binding the target nucleic acid. Thermal transition analysis of snap-to-it probes with complementary and single-mismatch DNA targets revealed that the transition between free and target-bound probe conformations was a reversible equilibrium, and the intramolecular chelate provided a thermodynamic barrier to target binding {{that resulted in a}} significant increase in mismatch discrimination. A 4 – 6 °C increase in specificity (ΔTm) was observed from snap-to-it <b>probes</b> <b>bearing</b> either terminal iminodiacetic acid ligands coordinated with Ni 2 +, or terminal dihistidine and nitrilotriacetic acid ligands coordinated with Cu 2 +. The difference in specificity of the PNA oligomer relative to DNA was more than doubled in snap-to-it probes. Snap-to-it probes labeled with a fluorophore-quencher pair exhibited target-dependent fluorescence enhancement upon binding with target DNA...|$|R
40|$|The Escherichia coli AlkB protein was {{recently}} found to repair cytotoxic DNA lesions 1 -methyladenine and 3 -methylcytosine {{by using a}} novel iron-catalyzed oxidative demethylation mechanism. Three human homologs, ABH 1, ABH 2 and ABH 3, have been identified, and two of them, ABH 2 and ABH 3, were shown to have similar repair activities to E. coli AlkB. However, ABH 1 did not show any repair activity. It was suggested that ABH 3 prefers single-stranded DNA and RNA substrates, whereas AlkB and ABH 2 can repair damage in both single- and double-stranded DNA. We employed a chemical cross-linking approach to probe the structure and substrate preferences of AlkB and its three human homologs. The putative active site iron ligands in these proteins were mutated to cysteine residues. These mutant proteins were used to cross-link to different DNA <b>probes</b> <b>bearing</b> thiol-tethered bases. Disulfide-linked protein–DNA complexes can be trapped and analyzed by SDS–PAGE. Our results show that ABH 2 and ABH 3 have structural and functional similarities to E. coli AlkB. ABH 3 shows preference for the single-stranded DNA probe. ABH 1 failed to cross-link to the probes tested. This protein, unlike other AlkB proteins, {{does not seem to}} interact with DNA in its E. coli expressed form...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{understandings}} in {{the development}} and spread of cancer have led to the realization of novel single cell analysis platforms focused on circulating tumor cells (CTCs). A simple, rapid, and inexpensive analytical platform capable of providing genetic information on these rare cells is highly desirable to support clinicians and researchers alike to either support the selection or adjustment of therapy or provide fundamental insights into cell function and cancer progression mechanisms. We report on the genetic profiling of single cancer cells, exploiting a combination of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and electrochemical detection. Cells were isolated using laser capture and lysed, and the mRNA was extracted and transcribed into DNA. Seven markers were amplified by MLPA, which allows for the simultaneous amplification of multiple targets with a single primer pair, using MLPA probes containing unique barcode sequences. Capture probes complementary to each of these barcode sequences were immobilized on a printed circuit board (PCB) manufactured electrode array and exposed to single-stranded MLPA products and subsequently to a single stranded DNA reporter <b>probe</b> <b>bearing</b> a HRP molecule, followed by substrate addition and fast electrochemical pulse amperometric detection. We present a simple, rapid, flexible, and inexpensive approach for the simultaneous quantification of multiple breast cancer related mRNA markers, with single tumor cell sensitivity...|$|R
