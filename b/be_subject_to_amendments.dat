Im Beitrag werden – ohne einen Anspruch auf Vollständigkeit – Forschungszugänge für (Gestaltungs-) Kompetenzen, Curricula, fachdidaktische Konzepte, Lehr-Lern-Arrangements, die Leistungserfassung und die lehrenden Akteure skizziert. Eröffnet werden einige wirtschaftsdidaktische Forschungskorridore, die für eine Bildung für nachhaltige Entwicklung in der ökonomischen Bildung von Interesse sein könnten. Ausgangspunkt ist die Überlegung, dass die ökonomische Bildung erst durch die Auseinandersetzung mit Nachhaltigkeit ihren Bildungsauftrag erfüllt. Although the {{discourse}} about sustainability has intensified {{over the last}} few years, this topic still does not get sufficient attention {{from the point of view}} of economical didactics. In this article, the writer outlines different research approaches for competences of organization, curricula, concepts of technical didactics, classroom arrangements that involve teaching and learning, the assessment of performances and the learning individuals. This contribution is not exhausting and therefore might <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>amendments</b> in the future. The writer presents a number of research approaches that seem to be promising for gains within the field of education for sustainable development and vocational education. As a starting point, the writer deems important that economical education can only fulfill its mission goals through an intense discourse about sustainability...|$|E

5|$|The {{convention}} {{spent several}} weeks in August in debating {{the powers of}} Congress. Although Mason was successful {{in some of his}} proposals, such as placing the state militias under federal regulation, and a ban on Congress passing an export tax, he lost on some that he deemed crucial. These losses included the convention deciding to allow importation of slaves to continue to at least 1800 (later amended to 1808) and to allow a simple majority to pass navigation acts that might require Virginians to export their tobacco in American-flagged ships, when it might be cheaper to use foreign-flagged vessels. The convention also weakened the requirement that money bills begin in the House and not <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>amendment</b> in the Senate, eventually striking the latter clause after debate that stretched fitfully over weeks. Despite these defeats, Mason continued to work constructively to build a constitution, serving on another grand committee that considered customs duties and ports.|$|R

Article 1 declared that the Dáil had [...] "full powers to legislate" [...] and would consist of representatives elected in elections conducted by the British government. For the exercise of executive power it created a cabinet, answerable to the Dáil, called the Aireacht (or Ministry), headed by a prime minister called the [...] "Príomh Aire" [...] (in practice also known as the President of Dáil Éireann). The constitution made no reference to a judiciary but this did not prevent the Dáil from establishing a system of Dáil Courts.
