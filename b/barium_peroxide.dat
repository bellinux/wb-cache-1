50|$|Thermate {{composition}} is a thermite one enriched with a salt-based oxidizer (usually nitrates, e.g. <b>barium</b> nitrate, or <b>peroxides).</b> In contrast with thermites, thermates burn with evolution of flame and gases.

50|$|Alexander von Humboldt {{synthesized}} one of {{the first}} synthetic peroxides, <b>barium</b> <b>peroxide,</b> in 1799 as a by-product of his attempts to decompose air. Nineteen years later Louis Jacques Thénard recognized that this compound could be used for the preparation of a previously unknown compound, which he described as oxidized water - subsequently known as hydrogen peroxide. Thénard and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac synthesized sodium peroxide in 1811. The bleaching effect of peroxides and their salts on natural dyes became known around that time, but early attempts of industrial production of peroxides failed, and the first plant producing hydrogen peroxide was built in 1873 in Berlin. The discovery of the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide by electrolysis with sulfuric acid introduced the more efficient electrochemical method. It was first implemented into industry in 1908 in Weißenstein, Carinthia, Austria. The anthraquinone process, which is still used, was developed during the 1930s by the German chemical manufacturer IG Farben in Ludwigshafen. The increased demand and improvements in the synthesis methods resulted in the rise of the annual production of hydrogen peroxide from 35,000 tonnes in 1950, to over 100,000 tonnes in 1960, to 300,000 tonnes by 1970; by 1998 it reached 2.7 million tonnes.|$|E

The working hypothesis was that the <b>barium</b> <b>peroxide</b> was oxidized to barium superoxide, and the superoxide acted as a nucleophile displacing the halogen. The resulting product was then chemically and electrolytically oxidized. The products of the oxidation were halide ions and barium carbonate. It was also shown that under similar conditions one could destroy polyvinyl chloride bottoms. However, it was shown that this technique would not destroy ethylenediamine, 1, 4 dicyanobutane or aromatic nitrobenzenes.

40|$|The {{current work}} assesses {{the impact of}} {{structural}} differences between stable and metastable ZrO 2 precursors on the mechanochemical preparation of BaZrO 3. Monoclinic (m-ZrO 2) and tetragonal (t-ZrO 2) zirconia polymorphs were prepared without stabilizing additives by slow alkaline precipitation. High-energy milling of the individual ZrO 2 precursors induced different partial transformations in each case. The as-synthesized m-ZrO 2 powders showed partial conversion to the tetragonal polymorph on mechanical activation, reaching about 10 % t-ZrO 2 after 420 min accompanied by increases in strain. In contrast, the as synthesized t-ZrO 2 powders underwent the inverse transformation to the monoclinic phase, producing about 50 % m-ZrO 2 after 120 min with the liberation of strain.
