5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of {{deception}} <b>by</b> <b>trial</b> and error. From mistakes during Camilla he learned to focus on what he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what he wanted them to think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting deception only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Portia have hunting tactics as {{versatile}} and adaptable as a lion's. All members of Portia have instinctive tactics for their most common prey, but can improvise <b>by</b> <b>trial</b> and error against unfamiliar prey or in unfamiliar situations, and then remember the new approach. They can also make detours {{to find the best}} attack angle against dangerous prey, even when the best detour takes a Portia out of visual contact with the prey, and sometimes the planned route leads to abseiling down a silk thread and biting the prey from behind. Such detours may take up to an hour, and a Portia usually picks the best route even if it needs to walk past an incorrect route. If a Portia makes a mistake while hunting another spider, it may itself be killed.|$|E
5|$|New {{drugs are}} the {{products}} of a long drug development process, {{the first step of}} which is often the discovery of a new enzyme inhibitor. In the past the only way to discover these new inhibitors was <b>by</b> <b>trial</b> and error: screening huge libraries of compounds against a target enzyme and hoping that some useful leads would emerge. This brute force approach is still successful and has even been extended by combinatorial chemistry approaches that quickly produce large numbers of novel compounds and high-throughput screening technology to rapidly screen these huge chemical libraries for useful inhibitors.|$|E

5|$|The {{cerebellum}} modulates {{the outputs}} of other brain systems, whether motor related or thought related, {{to make them}} certain and precise. Removal of the cerebellum does not prevent an animal from doing anything in particular, but it makes actions hesitant and clumsy. This precision is not built-in, but learned <b>by</b> <b>trial</b> and error. The muscle coordination learned while riding a bicycle {{is an example of}} a type of neural plasticity that may take place largely within the cerebellum. 10% of the brain's total volume consists of the cerebellum and 50% of all neurons are held within its structure.|$|E
5|$|Chulip is an adventure/simulation game {{in which}} the player must improve the hero's {{reputation}} {{in the community of}} Long Life Town by kissing its various citizens. The player's health is represented by a number of hearts. To gain more hearts the player has to find and kiss other characters in the game. Finding out how and when to kiss other characters is a puzzle in of itself. The game and each of its non-player characters (NPCs) follow a 24-hour day schedule. In the daytime, many of the NPCs of the game are walking around the streets. To succeed in kissing an NPC, the player is required to wait for the correct time where they will be happy and press the corresponding button. The player must sometimes complete a certain task for that NPC. Choosing the wrong time to kiss will often result in the player getting hit and losing health. Exploring Long Life Town presents the player with numerous environmental hazards discovered <b>by</b> <b>trial</b> and error. For instance, attempting to use the town's playground equipment or being suddenly shot at by the night-patrolling policeman will cause instant death. One mission ends in the player being struck by lightning, removing more than ten hearts and resulting in a game over if the player does not have sufficient health.|$|E
5|$|Cofresí {{received}} a council of war trial, with {{no possibility of}} a civil trial. The only right granted the pirates was to choose their lawyers; the arguments the attorneys could make were limited, and their role was a formality. José Madrazo was again the prosecutor. The case was hurried—an oddity, since other cases as serious (or more so) sometimes took months or years. Cofresí was reportedly tried as an insurgent corsair (and listed as such in a subsequent explanatory action in Spain), in accordance with measures enacted by governor Miguel de la Torre the year before. It is thought {{that the reason for}} the irregularities was that the Spanish government was under international scrutiny, with several neutral countries filing complaints about pirate and privateer attacks in Puerto Rican waters; there was additional pressure due to the start of David Porter's court-martial in the United States for invading the municipality of Fajardo. The ministry rushed the Cofresí trial, denying him and his crew defense witnesses or testimony (required <b>by</b> <b>trial</b> protocol). The trial was based on the pirates' confessions, with their legitimacy or circumstances not established.|$|E
5000|$|The Assize of Clarendon was an 1166 act of Henry II of England {{that began}} the {{transformation}} of English law from such systems for deciding the prevailing party in a case, especially felonies, as <b>trial</b> <b>by</b> ordeal or <b>trial</b> <b>by</b> battle or <b>trial</b> <b>by</b> compurgation to an evidentiary model, in which evidence, inspection, and inquiry was made by laymen, knights or ordinary freemen, under oath. This act greatly fostered the methods that would eventually be known in common law countries as <b>trial</b> <b>by</b> jury.|$|R

5|$|During the day, the French {{strengthened}} {{the positions of}} both battered ships, soldiers from the surrounding area gathering on the beaches to deter any boat attacks on the grounded vessels. Among the soldiers were men taken from several of Muskein's landing barges that were sheltering in the Dives River. These troops were identified <b>by</b> <b>Trial,</b> which briefly closed with Confiante to determine her condition and was fired on by the remaining guns in operation on the frigate. With their evacuation covered from the shore, most of the crew were removed from Confiante, including all the wounded. The French eventually abandoned the wrecked corvette in the evening. Vésuve was in better condition and remained well protected. Her crew shored up their vessel at low tide to prevent her falling over and prepared to heave the ship off as the tide rose. Due to the strong French military presence, Laforey decided to delay any operation against the beached vessels until circumstances were more favourable.|$|E
5|$|The single-player {{adventure}} {{begins by}} personalizing a player character. Each character has randomly generated values for their statistical character attributes: charisma, constitution, dexterity, intelligence, strength, and wisdom. While the algorithm stays the same, the player can randomize repeatedly for new character attribute distributions until satisfied. The player {{begins with a}} sword, armor, shield, and no money, and can only see his immediate surroundings, rather than the whole level. Monsters spawn randomly, and players have three options in battle: fight, use magic, or evade. Magic includes combative missiles, fireballs, lightning bolts, and turning the undead, as well as health regeneration and trap navigation. The effects of the game's most complex spells are not outlined in the instruction manual and must be learned <b>by</b> <b>trial</b> and error. Like the game, the battle events are carried out in real time instead of in turns. Enemies increase in difficulty as the player progresses through the dungeon. They include both living and undead monsters such as elves, dragons, mummies, and wraiths. Defeating enemies awards experience points, which accrete to raise the player's experience level and increase player stats. The player is rewarded with treasures that include magical weapons, armor items, and potions. Players can code their own features into the game.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} must {{investigate}} the surroundings through finding and entering doors. These doors contain shops where players can buy equipment, rooms which provide additional information {{needed in the}} quest, traps which contain powerful enemies, and exits {{to the next level}} which can be opened after finding a key. Some of the doors in the game are hidden and can only be found through <b>by</b> <b>trial</b> and error. At the beginning of the game, shops are visible and are clearly marked with the appropriate signs. Later on in the game, as Wonder Boy gets closer to the MEKA Dragon, the shop doors become unmarked while others are traps set by the level's bosses; {{near the end of the}} game, many of the shops are invisible and contain more powerful weapons. There are four types of shops throughout the game: boot shops allow the player to buy boots which make Wonder Boy jump higher and run faster, armor shops contain armor which makes Wonder Boy incur less damage from enemy attacks, shield shops contain shields which allow him to repel fire from enemies, and magical shops allow players to purchase Magic Weapons. There are also various rooms in the game which the player can enter and receive additional assistance in the quest: taverns where players can buy drinks and receive information from the bartender, Fortune Teller rooms where players may receive information about future events, and hospitals which allow players to refill their life meter and Hourglass Timer for a small price. Other rooms contain a boss in which the player must defeat to get the key to the next level, to earn additional gold, or to upgrade to a more powerful sword.|$|E
50|$|Priestly {{cooperation}} in <b>trials</b> <b>by</b> fire and water was forbidden by Pope Innocent III at the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 and replaced <b>by</b> compurgation. <b>Trials</b> <b>by</b> ordeal became rarer over the Late Middle Ages, but {{the practice was}} discontinued only in the 16th century.

50|$|Bethesda then filed {{motion in}} limine against Interplay. Interplay then {{filed a motion}} in limine against Bethesda the day after. Shortly after, the <b>trial</b> <b>by</b> jury which Bethesda {{requested}} on October 26, 2010 was changed to a <b>trial</b> <b>by</b> court because the APA contract (aka the second contract that sold Fallout to Bethesda) stated that all legal matters would be resolved via a <b>trial</b> <b>by</b> court and not a <b>trial</b> <b>by</b> jury. The <b>trial</b> <b>by</b> court began on December 12. In 2012, {{in a press conference}} Bethesda revealed that in exchange for 2 million dollars, Interplay gave to them full rights for Fallout Online. Interplay's rights to sell and merchandise Fallout, Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel expired on December 31, 2013.|$|R
25|$|Proving {{a number}} is prime {{is not done}} (for large numbers) <b>by</b> <b>trial</b> division. Many mathematicians have worked on primality tests for large numbers, often {{restricted}} to specific number forms. This includes Pépin's test for Fermat numbers (1877), Proth's theorem (around 1878), the Lucas–Lehmer primality test (originated 1856), and the generalized Lucas primality test. More recent algorithms like APRT-CL, ECPP, and AKS work on arbitrary numbers but remain much slower.|$|E
25|$|Bollier {{testified at}} the trial that the Scottish police had {{originally}} shown him a fragment of a brown 8-ply circuit board, of a prototype timer which had never been supplied to Libya. Yet the sample {{he was asked to}} identify {{at the trial}} was a green 9-ply circuit board that Mebo had indeed supplied to Libya.

25|$|The Visby lenses provide {{evidence}} that sophisticated lens-making techniques were being used by craftsmen over 1,000 years ago, {{at a time when}} researchers had only just begun to explore the laws of refraction.
