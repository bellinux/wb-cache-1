5|$|The 365-day haab was {{produced}} by a cycle of eighteen named 20-day winals, completed {{by the addition of}} 5-day period called the wayeb. The wayeb was considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> time, when the barriers between the mortal and supernatural realms were broken, allowing malignant deities to cross over and interfere in human concerns. In a similar way to the tz'olkin, the named winal would be prefixed by a number (from 0 to 19), {{in the case of the}} shorter wayeb period, the prefix numbers ran 0 to 4. Since each day in the tz'olkin had a name and number (e.g. 8 Ajaw), this would interlock with the haab, producing an additional number and name, to give any day a more complete designation, for example 8 Ajaw 13 Keh. Such a day name could only recur once every 52 years, and this period is referred to by Mayanists as the Calendar Round. In most Mesoamerican cultures, the Calendar Round was the largest unit for measuring time.|$|E
5|$|SMAW welding, {{like other}} welding methods, can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> and {{unhealthy}} practice if proper precautions are not taken. The process uses an open electric arc, which presents {{a risk of}} burns which are prevented by personal protective equipment {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area can lead to a condition called arc eye, in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding helmets with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, and in recent years, new helmet models have been produced that feature a face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. To protect bystanders, especially in industrial environments, translucent welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc, but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E
5|$|The PanzerI was {{upgraded}} {{in order}} to increase its lethality. On 8August 1937, Major General García Pallasar received a note from Generalísimo Francisco Franco that expressed the need for a PanzerI (or negrillo, as their Spanish crews called them) with a 20-millimeter gun. Ultimately, the piece chosen was the Breda Model 1935, due to the simplicity of the design over competitors such as the German Flak 30. Furthermore, the 20mm Breda was capable of perforating 40millimeters of armour at 250meters (1.57in at 275yd), which was more than sufficient to penetrate the frontal armour of the T-26. Although originally 40 Italian CV.35 light tanks were ordered with the Breda in place of their original armament, this order was subsequently canceled after it was thought that the adaptation of the same gun to the PanzerI would yield better results. Prototypes were ready by September1937 and an order was placed after successful results. The mounting of the Breda in the Panzer I required the original turret to be opened at the top and then extended by a vertical supplement. Four of these tanks were finished at the Armament Factory of Seville, but further production was canceled as it was decided sufficient numbers of Republican T-26 tanks had been captured to fulfill the Nationalist leadership's request for more lethal tanks. The Breda modification was not particularly liked by German crews, as the unprotected gap in the turret, designed to allow the tank's commander to aim, was found to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> weak point.|$|E

25|$|In Federalist No. 8, Alexander Hamilton {{worried that}} {{maintaining}} a large standing army would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> and expensive undertaking.

The implication was that control of a large military force is, at best, difficult and expensive, and at worst invites war and division. He foresaw the necessity of creating a civilian government that kept the military at a distance.|$|E
25|$|This time, {{however, the}} Bulgarians {{had decided to}} change the {{approach}} towards the Serbs.

According to Constantine VII's book De Administrando Imperio Simeon I resettled the whole population to the interior of Bulgaria and those who avoided captivity fled to Croatia, leaving the country deserted.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, the {{hobo spider}} was {{considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> species based on a toxicology study on rabbits where lesions appeared after spiders were induced to bite the rabbits. This laboratory study {{has led to the}} proposal that {{in some parts of the}} U.S. nearly all bites attributed to the brown recluse spider are in reality the hobo spider's bite. The CDC and other U.S. government agencies have also used this same study as the basis for a report claiming that the hobo spider bite causes necrosis in humans, despite the absence of any confirmed cases. Subsequent attempts to replicate the study by injecting sufficient venom to ensure envenomation have failed to produce necrotic lesions, and there is even question as to whether the lesions observed in the original study were necrotic. The CDC no longer considers it a dangerously venomous species.|$|E
25|$|After the affair, it came {{to light}} that Greenpeace had miscalculated the amount of toxic waste present aboard the Brent Spar. Greenpeace {{admitted}} that its claims that the Spar contained 5000 tons of oil were inaccurate, apologizing to Shell on September 5. However, Greenpeace dismissed {{the importance of the}} amount of oil on board, pointing to wider industrial responsibility as the main issue at hand, as the Brent Spar was to be the first offshore installation to be dumped in the northeast Atlantic ocean; Greenpeace claimed that it would likely have been followed by the scuttling of dozens or hundreds more platforms, setting what they consider to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> precedent. The organization went on to point out that Shell's decision to scrap the platform had been taken before Greenpeace announced the existence of an incorrect amount of toxic waste, and that their mistake therefore did not influence Shell's decision.|$|E

500|$|Director Winrich Kolbe {{had some}} {{ideas about how}} the {{engineering}} set, suggesting that it should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> place with the Voyager crew {{looking down on the}} engine core. Braga compared the idea to the Foucault pendulum in the rotunda at Griffith Observatory. James' designs were not as elaborate as Kolbe suggested, but together with visual effects supervisor Ronald B. Moore they worked out a means of enabling the director to film from above. They raised the set [...] over a blue screen to enable it to be backlit properly. Kolbe had a further impact on the design of the set; he suggested in a production meeting on February 25 that the change of lighting suggesting by James for the bridge should shift from the Starfleet colors to orange in order to maximise the alien effect. James produced a foamcore model of the Dauntless bridge, to both illustrate the final construction and to enable Kolbe to plan out his camera angles while it was still being built.|$|E
