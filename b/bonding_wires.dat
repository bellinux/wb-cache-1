40|$|Due to the {{multitude}} of advantages <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antennas have over conventional planar antennas (especially onchip planar antennas), they have received much research attention within the last four years. The focus of the contributions made {{so far has been}} on exploiting different configurations of single-element and array <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antennas for short-range applications at RF/microwave frequencies. However, the effects of process tolerances of <b>bond</b> <b>wires</b> on the radiation characteristics of <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antennas have not been studied in published literature. Therefore in this paper, we investigate the impact of up to 20 % fluctuations in the parameters of <b>bond</b> <b>wires</b> on the performance of 42 GHz and 60 GHz <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antennas. Our results reveal that the length and radius of <b>bond</b> <b>wires</b> are the most and least sensitive parameters, respectively. Furthermore, the severity of the impact of process tolerances depends on the impedance bandwidth of the original antenna, before considering the tolerances. For example, a 10 % change in the length of a <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> causes the resonance frequency of a 42 GHz antenna to be shifted out of the specified 3 GHz bandwidth (40. 5 GHz- 43. 5 GHz) required for point-to-point communication. However, although a 10 % change in length of a <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> yields a 2. 5 GHz shift in the resonance frequency of a 60 GHz <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antenna, it doesn't completely detune the antenna because of the original 6 GHz bandwidth available, prior to the fluctuation. Therefore, to prevent the impact of process tolerances from severely degrading the performance <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antennas, these antennas should be designed to have larger bandwidths than specified. For experimental verification, a <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antenna was designed, fabricated and measured. Very good correlation was obtained between measurement and simulation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—During {{manufacture}} of <b>wire</b> <b>bonding</b> in packaged IC products, {{the breaking of}} <b>bond</b> <b>wires</b> and the peeling of bond pads occur frequently. The result is open-circuit failure in IC products. There were several prior methods reported {{to overcome these problems}} by using additional process flows or special materials. In this paper, a layout method is proposed to improve the <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> reliability in general CMOS processes. By changing the layout patterns of bond pads, the reliability of <b>bond</b> <b>wires</b> on <b>bond</b> pads can be improved. A set of different layout patterns of bond pads has been drawn and fabricated in a 0. 6 - m single-poly triple-metal CMOS process for investigation by the <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> reliability tests, the ball shear test and the wire pull test. By im-plementing effective layout patterns on bond pads in packaged IC products, not only the <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> reliability can be improved, but also the bond pad capacitance can be reduced for high frequency application.

50|$|Red phosphorus, {{used as a}} charring-promoter flame retardant, {{facilitates}} {{silver migration}} when present in packaging. It is normally coated with aluminium hydroxide; if the coating is incomplete, the phosphorus particles oxidize to the highly hygroscopic phosphorus pentoxide, which reacts with moisture to phosphoric acid. This is a corrosive electrolyte that {{in the presence of}} electric fields facilitates dissolution and migration of silver, short-circuiting adjacent packaging pins, lead frame leads, tie bars, chip mount structures, and chip pads. The silver bridge may be interrupted by thermal expansion of the package; thus, disappearance of the shorting when the chip is heated and its reappearance after cooling is an indication of this problem. Delamination and thermal expansion may move the chip die relative to the packaging, deforming and possibly shorting or cracking the <b>bonding</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Secondary {{breakdown}} is {{a failure}} mode in bipolar power transistors. In a power transistor with a large junction area, under certain conditions of current and voltage, the current concentrates in a small spot of the base-emitter junction. This causes local heating, progressing into a short between collector and emitter. This often leads {{to the destruction of}} the transistor. Secondary breakdown can occur both with forward and reverse base drive. Except at low collector-emitter voltages, the secondary breakdown limit restricts the collector current more than the steady-state power dissipation of the device. Power MOSFETs do not exhibit secondary breakdown, and their safe operating area is limited only by maximum current (the capacity of the <b>bonding</b> <b>wires),</b> maximum power dissipation and maximum voltage. [...] However, Power MOSFETs have parasitic PN and BJT elements within the structure, which can cause more complex localized failure modes resembling Secondary Breakdown.|$|E
50|$|The {{physical}} layout of an opto-isolator depends {{primarily on the}} desired isolation voltage. Devices rated {{for less than a}} few kV have planar (or sandwich) construction. The sensor die is mounted directly on the lead frame of its package (usually, a six-pin or a four-pin dual in-line package). The sensor is covered with a sheet of glass or clear plastic, which is topped with the LED die. The LED beam fires downward. To minimize losses of light, the useful absorption spectrum of the sensor must match the output spectrum of the LED, which almost invariably lies in the near infrared. The optical channel is made as thin as possible for a desired breakdown voltage. For example, to be rated for short-term voltages of 3.75 kV and transients of 1 kV/μs, the clear polyimide sheet in the Avago ASSR-300 series is only 0.08 mm thick. Breakdown voltages of planar assemblies depend on the thickness of the transparent sheet and the configuration of <b>bonding</b> <b>wires</b> that connect the dies with external pins. Real in-circuit isolation voltage is further reduced by creepage over the PCB and the surface of the package. Safe design rules require a minimal clearance of 25 mm/kV for bare metal conductors or 8.3 mm/kV for coated conductors.|$|E

Testing indicated that each GLAS laser should last for two years, requiring GLAS to carry three lasers in order to fulfil the nominal mission length. During the initial on orbit test operation, a pump diode module on the first GLAS laser failed prematurely on 29 March 2003. A subsequent investigation indicated that a corrosive degradation of the pump diodes, due to an unexpected but known reaction between indium solder and gold <b>bonding</b> <b>wires,</b> had possibly reduced {{the reliability of the}} lasers.

50|$|Earthing connects exposed {{conductive}} {{parts of}} electrical equipment to earth {{in order to}} complete a circuit {{in the event that}} the insulation on a live conductor should fail. Earthing therefore provides a return path for the current required to blow fuses or trip circuit breakers and RCDs, and ensures that the supply is reliably disconnected {{in the event of a}} fault. Bonding is the connection of the exposed conductive part of electrical equipment or objects like mains water / gas supply pipe to the main Earth terminal (MET) to bring all exposed metalwork into the same electrical potential. This is done to minimise the danger of electric shock due to human contact with live parts which could result from bad insulation and insulation failures. <b>Bonding</b> <b>wires</b> are typically thicker than earthing wires to ensure that they have a sufficiently low resistance that hazardous voltages (as calculated by V=IR) cannot appear even in the presence of large fault currents. In domestic wiring, earthing of equipment is done by bonding together the earth points and metallic parts of the appliances and earthed bodies using green/yellow wire coming from the consumer main earthing terminal. The earth terminal is in turn connected to either consumer’s earth electrode (TT system) or to the earth point given by the supplier (TN system). In pre-1966 buildings, the earthing may be connected only to the plumbing system, which is creating potential earthing problems in buildings where the metal pipes are being replaced by non-conductive plastic pipes.|$|E

Today, virtually all digital electronics use CMOS circuitry. Bernard worked at Fairchild Semiconductor in Silicon Valley from 1958 ( [...] he was employee number 158 [...] ), through the buyouts of the company by Schlumberger and National Semiconductor, and finally retiring in 1990. In the 1960s Fairchild Semiconductor, a division of Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp., and Texas Instruments, revolutionized electronics by employing the first integrated circuit technology. Fairchild's Robert Noyce [...] filed for this patent using deposited (printed) metal lines and Jean Hoerni's Planar Process ( [...] patent also filed by Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments but with using <b>bonding</b> <b>wires</b> [...] ). At the time virtually all the devices were of the bipolar type which were used to construct RTL and DTL type circuits ( [...] Resistor-Transistor-Logic, Diode-Transistor-Logic), which unfortunately drew more power than was desired, and eventually lost ground to Texas Instruments' TTL (Transistor-Transistor-logic). The next great technological leap in computer chips would be CMOS transistors, which promised significantly lower power and greater circuit density than the Bipolar circuitry. Although Frank Wanlass first filed for the CMOS patent in 1963, Fairchild could not produce the devices for commercial output for many years because of the mystery of the mobile ions degrading their performance. Much research time and money was expended in 1967 and 1968 at Fairchild on trying to manufacture the highly promising technology, the MOS SGT ( [...] Metal Oxide Semiconductor Silicon Gate Technology [...] ) circuits utilizing the field effect from the [...] "gate" [...] on the conducting [...] "channel" [...] from source to drain.|$|E

Their results reveal that although the partial self-inductance of the signal wires is the same in both configurations, the partial mutual inductance of the coplanar configuration is higher, resulting in a smaller loop inductance. Consequently, the return and insertion losses are smaller. By reducing the distance between the signal and return currents, they further reduced the loop inductance, and significantly optimized the coplanar configuration. For example, considering a 1 mm long <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> with a diameter of 25 micron, they successfully kept the power lost through the coplanar configuration below 10 % at 15 GHz, in comparison to the 70 % power lost through the two-conductor configuration at the same frequency.
