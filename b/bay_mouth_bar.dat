30|$|The {{sandstone}} {{from the}} Oligocene Xiaganchaigou Formation (E 3) in the Lengdong area, Qaidam Basin, China, is extensively distributed and {{acts as an}} effective regional reservoir for hydrocarbon accumulation. Based on thin sections, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) image analysis and cathodoluminescence (CL), a comprehensive analysis of the sedimentology, petrography, diagenesis and reservoir quality of the Oligocene sandstone reservoirs of the Xiaganchaigou (E 3) Formation in the Lengdong area, Qaidam Basin, are studied. The sandstones in the Lengdong area are classified as argillaceous sandstone, silty sandstone, fine sandstone, medium sandstone, pebbly sandstone, conglomeratic sandstone and conglomerate based on their grain sizes, degrees of sorting, and matrix contents. Five sedimentary facies were identified in the Xiaganchaigou Formation (E 3) of the Lengdong area, Qaidam Basin: distributary channel, interdistributary <b>bay,</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>bar,</b> central bar and distal sand sheet facies. Their major diagenetic processes include compaction, carbonate cementation and feldspar and calcite cement dissolution. The porosity and permeability values of the fine sandstone, conglomerate, and conglomeratic sandstone are the highest, followed by those of the medium sandstone and silty sandstone, and the argillaceous sandstone and pebbly sandstone have the lowest porosity and permeability values. The diagenetic sequence {{in the study area}} ranges from the eodiagenesis B stage to the mesodiagenetic A stage. Compaction has significantly reduced the primary porosity. Carbonate cements, mainly calcite cements, occlude pores by precipitating in intergranular and intragranular spaces. Dissolution largely contributes to increasing the secondary porosity. The well-sorted and relatively coarser-grained sandstones that formed in higher-energy sedimentary facies (distributary channel, mouth bar and central bar) have a better reservoir quality than the poorly sorted, clay-rich sandstones that formed in low-energy environments (interdistributary bay and distal sand sheet). Based on the comprehensive analysis of petrographic data, diagenesis and sedimentary facies, the reservoir in the Lengdong area is classified into three types: type A, type B and type C. Type A, located {{in the center of the}} study area, is the most favorable reservoir, while type C sandstone is the last to consider when looking for a good reservoir. This study can guide hydrocarbon exploration in the Lengdong area, as well as in northwestern China and similar areas throughout the world.|$|E

30|$|This study {{discusses}} the formation mechanisms {{of the delta}} front reservoir of K 1 q 4 of the Quantou Formation in the central region of the Fuyu oil field and summarizes the types of deposition based on an analysis of facies markers and a comprehensive study of the sedimentary microfacies using well cores, logs, and geologic data. The results show that K 1 q 4 of the Quantou Formation mainly formed through shallow-water sedimentation on a delta front and includes five sedimentary microfacies: underwater distributary channels, underwater natural levees, underwater diversion <b>bays,</b> river <b>mouth</b> <b>bars,</b> and distal bars. Due {{to the effects of}} allocyclicity, the composite sand body evolved by vertical overlaying, whereas because of the effects of autocyclicity, the composite sand body evolved by horizontal transport.

A more detailed re-interpretation and re-logging of the same section, with a supporting juxtaposed sections show a transition from a distal prodelta setting with prodelta mud and storm deposits with hummocky cross stratification into proximal prodelta settings with abundant and large scale soft-sediment deformed layers.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{processes}} {{for the formation of}} deltas and their fluvial networks is the deposition of <b>mouth</b> <b>bars</b> in front of prograding distributaries. Waves influence <b>mouth</b> <b>bar</b> growth, {{but it is not clear}} how and to what extent. Toward this end, we conduct a modeling study on deltas forming in sheltered bays, where waves are locally generated and both longshore currents and surf zone are absent. We focus on the simplified case of a homopycnal river plume subject to frontal wave attack, and we begin by isolating the effects of waves on jet spreading. An analytical model for the hydrodynamic interaction between incoming waves and a turbulent expanding jet is developed and tested with the numerical model Delft 3 D coupled to the wave model SWAN. Both the analytical model and Delft 3 D predict that incoming surface gravity waves increase the spreading of the jet and the interaction between wave and current boundary layers causes an increase in bottom friction. To investigate how waves influence <b>mouth</b> <b>bar</b> morphodynamics, a set of numerical simulations is run with Delft 3 D-SWAN utilizing a geometry and wave characteristics typical of sheltered bays. Our numerical results show that in the presence of waves, <b>mouth</b> <b>bars</b> form up to 35 % closer to the river mouth and 40 % faster when compared to cases without waves. The distance from the river mouth to the stagnated <b>mouth</b> <b>bar</b> decreases with increasing wave height and wave period. The timescale of bar formation is inversely proportional to wave height and directly proportional to wave period. Our modeling study suggests that wave influence on <b>mouth</b> <b>bar</b> growth is complex. Small waves, like the ones modeled here, promote <b>mouth</b> <b>bar</b> formation via increased jet spreading and faster formation time, which in turn should create deltas with more distributary channels. On the other hand, large waves suppress <b>mouth</b> <b>bar</b> formation, as seen in other studies, leading to fewer distributary channels.

50|$|A <b>mouth</b> <b>bar</b> is {{a bar in}} a {{river that}} is {{typically}} created {{in the middle of}} a channel in a river delta. It is created by a positive feedback between mid-channel deposition and flow divergence. As the flow diverges near the ocean, sediment settles out in the channel and creates an incipient <b>mouth</b> <b>bar.</b> As flow is routed around the incipient bar, additional sediment is deposited on the incipient bar. This continued process results in the formation of a full-fledged <b>mouth</b> <b>bar,</b> which causes the channel to bifurcate. This continued process leads to the characteristic fractal tree pattern found in some prograding river-dominated deltas.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Clinothems are seaward-dipping beds {{which are}} {{deposited}} during the progradation of delta-front <b>mouth</b> <b>bars.</b> Measurements taken from clinothems {{in the field}} and from geospatially constrained, photo-realistic virtual outcrops were used to record clinothem dip, maximum bed thickness, and bed thickness every 10 m along a series of depositional-dip-oriented profiles from two ancient river-dominated delta successions which crop out in central Utah, USA. These data show systematic changes in bed dip and bed thinning which highlight discrete packaging of the beds into bedsets, interpreted to represent the progradation of stream <b>mouth</b> <b>bars</b> in the delta front. Individual bedsets are characterized by a progressive steepening of beds coupled with a more rapid thinning. Systematic collection of 2800 locations along 73 separate clinothems from the Panther Tongue Sandstone Member and parasequence 1 f from the Ferron Sandstone were used to study the relationship between bed thickness, dip, and decay gradient parameter (t), which describes the down-dip bed thinning. Clinothems in the Panther Tongue are much longer and more gently dipping than the clinothems in the Ferron Sandstone. In both systems, beds can be clustered into groups (bedsets) which show a systematic decrease in t-values and an increase in dip angle. Boundaries between the groups are defined by a sudden increase in t-values and a concurrent decrease in dip angle. These bedsets are interpreted to represent individual stream <b>mouth</b> <b>bars</b> which amalgamate to form <b>mouth</b> <b>bar</b> complexes within the delta-front sand bodies. The use of virtual outcrops was essential for the collection of the large volumes of thickness data and the recognition of very subtle (, 1 u) changes in dip angle which have made these interpretations possible...|$|R

30|$|The {{observed}} {{velocity field}} at the surface (− 10  m depth) on July 5 (Figure  11 e) shows a clockwise circulation {{that is similar to}} the simulation, although current speeds for the circulation were generally five times greater than simulated speeds. The underestimation of the surface velocity field {{can be attributed to the}} model's vertical resolution; the layer thickness around the surface layer, from 0 to 20  m, is coarse (4  m), which may insufficiently resolve the surface boundary layer. Local inconsistencies between the simulation and observations were found to correspond to detailed flow patterns around the <b>bay</b> <b>mouth</b> and along the northern coast in the outer bay. The inconsistency around the <b>bay</b> <b>mouth</b> can be attributed to tidal components, for example, the 10  cm s− 1 velocity observed at the <b>bay</b> <b>mouth</b> (Ohtani [1981]) can be attributed to the M 2 tidal component. The local wind pattern can induce the observed inconsistency in the outer bay, because the horizontal resolution of the wind (GPV/MSM) was originally 5  km, insufficient to resolve the 10  km spatial pattern of the wind. The observed speed at a depth of − 50  m (Figure  11 f) was comparable to the simulated speeds (not shown), which also suggests that the simulation underestimated the surface velocity field.|$|R
