They were there for us to enjoy and they were there for us to pray. But it wasn't meant to be carved into images, which is very wrong for all of us. The more I think about it, the more it's a desecration of our Indian culture. Not just Crazy Horse, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E
2500|$|We {{sympathize with}} your {{difficult}} position, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> agree that locking the gates {{is contrary to}} the principle of open inquiry for which the university stands. Historically, Harvard has never locked its gates (at least, not in recent memory), and we believe that security issues can be addressed differently. [...] We do not share the perception that the Occupy movement constitutes a threat to Harvard. To the contrary, we are in sympathy with protests against increasing inequality in the United States and believe that Harvard should welcome discussions of the issue.|$|E

60|$|WILLIE. Oh, I see. What's {{best for}} everybody! I see! Well, for myself, I'm much obliged--there's nothing {{for us to}} do, gentlemen, <b>but</b> for <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to bow {{acknowledgments}} to Mr. Job Arthur Freer, who so kindly has ALL our interests at heart.|$|R
60|$|HESTER. [Waving him back.] Don't, don't! You cannot love me at all, {{unless you}} love her also. You cannot honour me, unless she's holier to you. In her all womanhood is martyred. Not she alone, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are {{stricken}} in her house.|$|E

6000|$|... "Dear little girl," [...] he said, [...] "perhaps you are right. I am not {{altogether}} honest. I {{am not in}} the least like the sort of man who ought to look at you and feel towards you as I have looked and felt during these wonderful days. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have our weak spots, you know.

5000|$|We won't be able {{to detect}} the changes while they happen because they will be deep, but slow, and will take centuries to fully develop. Future generations will look unto us as an era of {{permanent}} turmoil, <b>but</b> not <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> will live realizing this.|$|R
50|$|At 13, {{her life}} was tough and her parents had to move to their uncle. She always {{wondered}} what life was all about then.

6000|$|She gently {{smiled as}} she answered, [...] "We are the ghosts of the future. We {{are the people who}} are to live in this city generations hence. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> do not know that, principally because we do not think about it and study about it enough to know it.

60|$|In this {{condition}} we lived upwards of a year, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{began to be}} very much tired of it, and, whatever came of it, resolved to attempt an escape. We had furnished ourselves with no less than three very good canoes; and as the monsoons, or trade-winds, generally affect that country, blowing in most parts of this island one six months of a year one way, and the other six months another way, we concluded {{we might be able to}} bear the sea well enough. But always, when we came to look into it, the want of fresh water was the thing that put us off from such an adventure, for it is a prodigious length, and what no man on earth could be able to perform without water to drink.|$|E

"She was a-visiting {{there at}} Booth's Landing, {{and just in}} {{the edge of the}} evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry to stay all night at her friend's house, Miss What-you-may-call-her I disremember her name--and they lost their steering-oar, and swung around and went a-floating down, stern first, about two mile, and saddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck. Well, about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading-scow, and it was so dark we didn't notice the wreck till we was right on it; and so WE saddle-baggsed; <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> was saved but Bill Whipple--and oh, he WAS the best cretur!--I most wish 't it had been me, I do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] cried Mary Louise, {{blushing}} red. [...] "I couldn't {{have done}} anything at all {{without the help of}} you girls.

5000|$|It {{will take}} a {{combined}} effort of academia, government, and industry {{to bring about the}} change from a gasoline economy to a hydrogen economy.

6000|$|... "You see," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Merrill {{wiping his}} brow, for {{he found the}} matter even more difficult than he had imagined, [...] "it was not until Duncan told me how you had acted in his library that I guessed the truth--that I remembered myself how you had acted. I knew {{that you were not}} mixed up in politics, but I also knew that you were an intimate friend of Jethro's, and I thought that you had been let into the secret of the woodchuck session. I don't defend the game of politics as it is played, Mr. Wetherell, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who are friends of Jethro's are generally willing to lend a hand in any little manoeuvre that is going on, and have a practical joke when we can. It was not until I saw you sitting there beside Duncan that the idea occurred to me. It didn't make a great deal of difference whether Duncan or Lovejoy got to the House or not, provided they didn't learn of the matter too early, because some of their men had been bought off that day. It suited Jethro's sense of humor to play the game that way--and it was very effective. When I saw you there beside Duncan I remembered that he had spoken about the Guardian letters, and the notion occurred to me to get him to show you his library. I have explained to him that you were innocent. I--I hope you haven't been worrying." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must {{understand}} this diamond was a valuable one--a little Jew chap, a diamond merchant, {{who was with}} us, had put it at three or four thousand when Padishah had shown it to him--and this idea of an ostrich gamble caught on. Now it happened that I'd been having a few talks on general subjects {{with the man who}} looked after these ostriches, and quite incidentally he'd said one of the birds was ailing, and he fancied it had indigestion. It had one feather in its tail almost all white, by which I knew it, and so when, next day, the auction started with it, I capped Padishah's eighty-five by ninety. I fancy I was a bit too sure and eager with my bid, and some of the others spotted the fact that I was in the know. And Padishah went for that particular bird like an irresponsible lunatic. At last the Jew diamond merchant got it for £175, and Padishah said £180 just after the hammer came down--so Potter declared. At any rate the Jew merchant secured it, and there and then he got a gun and shot it. Potter made a Hades of a fuss because he said it would injure the sale of the other three, and Padishah, of course, behaved like an idiot; <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were very much excited. I can tell you I was precious glad when that dissection was over, and no diamond had turned up--precious glad. I'd gone to one-forty on that particular bird myself.|$|E

6000|$|In certain moods {{she could}} wring his heart by such {{imagined}} speeches, the very quality {{of her voice}} was in them, a softness that his ear had loved, and not only could she distress him, but when Benham was in this heartache mood, when once she had set him going, then his little mother also would rise against him, touchingly indignant, with her blue eyes bright with tears; and his frowsty father would back towards him and sit down complaining that he was neglected, and even little Mrs. Skelmersdale would reappear, bravely tearful on her chair looking after him as he slunk away from her through Kensington Gardens; indeed every personal link he had ever had to life could in certain moods pull him back {{through the door of}} self-reproach Amanda opened and set him aching and accusing himself of harshness and self-concentration. The very kittens of his childhood revived forgotten moments of long-repented hardness. For a year before Prothero was killed there were these heartaches. That tragedy gave them their crowning justification. All these people said in this form or that, [...] "You owed a debt to us, you evaded it, you betrayed us, you owed us life out of yourself, love and services, and you have gone off from us all with this life that was ours, to live by yourself in dreams about the rule of the world, and with empty phantoms of power and destiny. All this was intellectualization. You sacrificed us to the thin things of the mind. There is no rule of the world at all, or none that a man like you may lay hold upon. The rule of the world is a fortuitous result of incalculably multitudinous forces. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> you could have made happier. You could have spared us distresses. Prothero died because of you. Presently it will be the turn of your father, your mother--Amanda perhaps...." ...|$|E
60|$|Another {{class of}} tramp is a man, the most {{valuable}} part of whose stock-in-trade is a highly perplexed demeanour. He is got up like a countryman, and you will often come upon the poor fellow, while he is endeavouring to decipher the inscription on a milestone-- quite a fruitless endeavour, for he cannot read. He asks your pardon, he truly does (he is very slow of speech, this tramp, and he looks in a bewildered way all round the prospect while he talks to you), <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> shold do as we wold be done by, and he'll take it kind, if you'll put a power man in the right road fur to jine his eldest son as has broke his leg bad in the masoning, and is in this heere Orspit'l as is wrote down by Squire Pouncerby's own hand as wold not tell a lie fur no man. He then produces from under his dark frock (being always very slow and perplexed) a neat but worn old leathern purse, from which he takes a scrap of paper. On this scrap of paper is written, by Squire Pouncerby, of The Grove, 'Please to direct the Bearer, a poor but very worthy man, to the Sussex County Hospital, near Brighton'--a matter of some difficulty at the moment, seeing that the request comes suddenly upon you {{in the depths of}} Hertfordshire. The more you endeavour to indicate where Brighton is--when you have with the greatest difficulty remembered--the less the devoted father can be made to comprehend, and the more obtusely he stares at the prospect; whereby, being reduced to extremity, you recommend the faithful parent to begin by going to St. Albans, and present him with half- a-crown. It does him good, no doubt, but scarcely helps him forward, since you find him lying drunk that same evening in the wheelwright's sawpit under the shed where the felled trees are, opposite the sign of the Three Jolly Hedgers.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have seen}} to-day that every shade of popular opinion is {{represented}} here, with Freedom or rather Free-Soil as the basis. We {{have come together}} as in some sort representatives of popular opinion against the extension of slavery into territory now free in fact {{as well as by}} law, and the pledged word of the statesmen of the nation who are now no more. We come--we are here assembled together--to protest as well as we can against a great wrong, and to take measures, as well as we now can, to make that wrong right; to place the nation, as far as it may be possible now, as it was before the repeal of the Missouri Compromise; and the plain {{way to do this is}} to restore the Compromise, and to demand and determine that Kansas shall be free! [Immense applause.] While we affirm, and reaffirm, if necessary, our devotion to the principles of the Declaration of Independence, let our practical work here be limited to the above. We know that there is not a perfect agreement of sentiment here on the public questions which might be rightfully considered in this convention, and that the indignation which we all must feel cannot be helped; <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> must give up something for the good of the cause. There is one desire which is uppermost in the mind, one wish common to us all--to which no dissent will be made; and I counsel you earnestly to bury all resentment, to sink all personal feeling, make all things work to a common purpose in which we are united and agreed about, and which all present will agree is absolutely necessary--which must be done by any rightful mode if there be such: Slavery must be kept out of Kansas! [Applause.] The test--the pinch--is right there. If we lose Kansas to freedom, an example will be set which will prove fatal to freedom in the end. We, therefore, in the language of the Bible, must [...] "lay the axe to the root of the tree." [...] Temporizing will not do longer; now is the time for decision--for firm, persistent, resolute action. [Applause.] ...|$|E

6000|$|Neither {{are these}} {{commands}} to each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> by ourselves, <b>but</b> to <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> together, {{as members of}} a family. If you will look through them they are not things to be done to ourselves, but to our neighbours; not experiences to be felt about our own souls: but rules of conduct to our fellow-men. They are all different branches and flowers from that one root: [...] "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." ...|$|R
6000|$|We hear a {{great deal}} about repentance, and how {{necessary}} it is for a man to repent of his sins; for unless a man repent, he cannot be forgiven. <b>But</b> do we <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> really know what repentance means? ...|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{reorganization}} {{and before the}} national publicity, 8 of 11 freshman women who received invitations to join Delta Zeta during formal recruitment chose not to become members.
