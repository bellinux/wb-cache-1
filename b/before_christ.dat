25|$|The New Testament {{consists}} of {{writings of the}} apostles and a very few other authors writing within apostolic times.

The eastern regions of ancient Christianity adopted primarily the Greek-language Jewish translation of those writings known as the Septuagint, while the western regions (under the administration of Rome) depended at first on various Latin translations.|$|E

25|$|Groups {{of liberal}} Catholics view the {{traditional}} {{image of the}} Virgin Mary as presented by the Catholic Church as an obstacle towards realization of the goal of womanhood, and {{as a symbol of}} the systemic patriarchal oppression of women within the Church. Moreover, some liberal Catholics view the cultivation of the traditional image of Mary as a method of manipulation of Catholics at large by the Church hierarchy. Other liberal Christians argue that the modern concepts of equal opportunity for men and women does not resonate well with the humble image of Mary, obediently and subserviently kneeling <b>before</b> <b>Christ.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jeremiah {{exists in}} two versions, a Greek translation, called the Septuagint, {{dating from the}} last few centuries <b>before</b> <b>Christ</b> and found in the {{earliest}} Christian manuscripts, and the Masoretic Hebrew text of traditional Jewish bibles – the Greek version is shorter than the Hebrew by about one eighth, and arranges the material differently. Equivalents of both versions were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, so that {{is clear that the}} differences mark important stages in the transmission of the text. Most scholars hold that the Hebrew text underlying the Septuagint version is older than the Masoretic text, and that the Masoretic evolved either from this or from a closely related version. The shorter version ultimately became canonical in Greek Orthodox churches, while the longer was adopted in Judaism and in Western Christian churches.|$|E
25|$|A 14th-century mosaic (right) {{from the}} Kahriye-Cami or Chora Church in Istanbul gives an {{excellent}} {{view of a}} range of costume from the late period. From the left, there is a soldier on guard, the governor in one of the large hats worn by important officials, a middle-ranking civil servant (holding the register roll) in a dalmatic with a wide border, probably embroidered, over a long tunic, which also has a border. Then comes a higher-ranking soldier, carrying a sword on an untied belt or baldric. The Virgin and St Joseph are in their normal iconographic dress, and behind St Joseph a queue of respectable citizens wait their turn to register. Male hem lengths drop as the status of the person increases. All the exposed legs have hose, and the soldiers and citizens have foot-wrappings above, presumably with sandals. The citizens wear dalmatics with a wide border around the neck and hem, but not as rich as that of the middle-level official. The other men would perhaps wear hats if not {{in the presence of the}} governor. A donor figure in the same church, the Grand Logothete Theodore Metochites, who ran the legal system and finances of the Empire, wears an even larger hat, which he keeps on whilst kneeling <b>before</b> <b>Christ</b> (see Gallery).|$|E

[...] At Paine's request, his wife's likeness was incorporated into the left panel of the window as a red-clad figure kneeling <b>before</b> <b>Christ.</b> [...] The west window, designed by Charles Connick, pays homage to Waltham's manufacturing history. In addition to images of Ruth, Solomon, and Noah — all industrious figures in the Bible — the window features rivets, a bicycle wheel, a watch escapement, a Metz car, and other symbols that reference Waltham's industrial character. [...] Along the south wall is a signed Tiffany window, designed by Tiffany artist Frederick Wilson. [...] The window depicts the Nativity, and was given to the church in 1908 by John H. Storer in memory of Frank Henry Perkins and Mary Ella Perkins. [...] Also along the south wall is a window by noted Boston stained glass artist Donald MacDonald. [...] This work, given in memory of Harriet K. Parmenter, depicts the Easter scene of the risen Christ revealing himself to Mary Magdalene.|$|E

500|$|As well as lavish illumination, {{the period}} saw the {{development}} of a distinct English tradition of line drawing in manuscripts, sometimes with the addition of light colour in ink or wash (watercolour), often to reinforce ink in highlighting outlines. This is often divided into two rather different sub-styles. These also developed from continental styles [...] one of which, sometimes referred to as the [...] "Utrecht style", was influenced strongly by the presence in Canterbury from around 1000 of the Carolingian Utrecht Psalter, where each psalm is illustrated with a panoramic ink drawing full of tiny figures. The Harley Psalter from Canterbury (probably 1020s) is a copy, with differences in style such as the addition of coloured washes. Dunstan was himself an artist, as were many monks who rose to senior positions, and the earliest datable outline drawing is probably by him, and includes a portrait of him prostrating himself <b>before</b> <b>Christ.</b> This was added to a blank page in an older book, probably before his exile in 956. The other [...] "Winchester" [...] style of drawing can be characterised by detailed and agitated drapery, an effect sometimes taken to excess, but giving animation to figures. The skilled use of line drawing continued to be a feature of English art for centuries, for example in the Eadwine Psalter (Canterbury, probably 1150s) and the work of Matthew Paris, monk of St Albans (c. 1200 – 1259) and his followers.|$|E
