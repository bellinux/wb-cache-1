The proposed model predicts the experimental data of permeability reduction during coinjection of solvent and asphaltenic oil into core with reasonable agreement. Viscosity variation due to sonication of crude oil is used to determine the fluid mobility applied in the model. The results of modeling indicate that the fluid samples exposed to ultrasound may cause much less asphaltene-induced damage inside the porous medium. Sensitivity analysis of the model parameters showed that there is an optimum time period during which the best stimulation efficiency is observed. The results of this work can be helpful to better understand the role of ultrasound prohibition in dynamic behavior of asphaltene deposition in porous media.

40|$|The {{study of}} flow of non-Newtonian fluids in porous media is very {{important}} and serves {{a wide variety of}} practical applications in processes such as enhanced oil recovery from underground reservoirs, filtration of polymer solutions and soil remediation through the removal of liquid pollutants. These fluids occur in diverse natural and synthetic forms and can be regarded as the rule rather than the exception. They show very complex strain and time dependent behavior and may have initial yield-stress. Their common feature is that they do not obey the simple Newtonian relation of proportionality between stress and rate of deformation. Non-Newtonian fluids are generally classified into three main categories: time-independent whose strain rate solely depends on the instantaneous stress, time-dependent whose strain rate is a function of both magnitude and duration of the applied stress and viscoelastic which shows partial elastic recovery on removal of the deforming stress and usually demonstrates both time and strain dependency.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. Absorption heat pumps (AHPs) operate by refrigeration techniques that use heat without requiring a compressor. In this study, an innovative AHP system is proposed that uses waste heat at 80 °C to produce hot air (at least 120 °C), {{which can be used}} for applications such as drying, and to simultaneously generate steam of 100 – 115 °C. Air is heated directly by heat exchange in the absorber working in the heating mode of a LiBr/H 2 O AHP system. Steam is then produced by heat exchange with the absorption solution, which is still at high temperature. The performance of a bench-scale AHP was evaluated by examination of running in a continuous mode. The tested AHP achieved a hot air temperature of more than 120 °C at the outlet of the absorber, and steam up to 115 °C was simultaneously generated by recovering heat from 80 °C hot water. The coefficient of performance, which is defined as the ratio of heat generated to the power consumed for pumping fluid, exceeded 20.

The Helmholtz-type water-cooled pulse combustor consists of a combustion chamber, a resonant pipe and aero-dynamic intake valves supplying air needed for combustion. Inside the boiler model a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> is mounted representing one of the convective parts of the boiler.

The laboratory experiments showed: weakening of the generated pressure pulsations of the exhaust gases on the boundary between burner and the interior of the boiler model; weakening of pressure pulsations in the free space of the boiler model; weakening of pressure pulsations during propagation through the tube bundle; impacts of the pulsating flow of the exhaust gases and generated sound energy {{on the walls of the}} boiler model.

50|$|Tubular modules look {{similar to}} {{shell and tube}} heat {{exchangers}} with <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> with the active surface of the membrane on the inside. Flow through the tubes is normally turbulent, ensuring low concentration polarisation but also increasing energy costs. The tubes can either be self-supporting or supported by insertion into perforated metal tubes. This module design is limited for nanofiltration by the pressure they can withstand before bursting, limiting the maximum flux possible. Due to both the high energy operating costs of turbulent flow and the limiting burst pressure, tubular modules are more suited to ‘dirty’ applications where feeds have particulates such as filtering raw water to gain potable water in the Fyne process. The membranes can be easily cleaned through a ‘pigging’ technique with foam balls are squeezed through the tubes, scouring the caked deposits.|$|R

The medium has been modeled as a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> and the capillary forces inside these tubes have been investigated. This has been done by applying well known theory of immiscible flow to tubes of different shapes. How the wettabillity of the media affect the meniscus curvatures have been studied and how this relates to the cross-section geometry and width of a single tube. The tube radius was modeled by a function being narrow {{in the middle of the}} tube and wider towards the end. How the menisci was affected by this curvature due to varying radius have been investigated. Different degrees of complexity have been used to see if simple approximations are able to capture the relevant physics or if a higher order of complexity is needed. It was found that the cross-sectional shape does not have a big impact on the flow, however thin film flow is neglected. When looking at how the radius affected the results it was found that approximations used in previous work was sufficient for small wetting angles, however at large wetting angles this expression became inaccurate. Finally different radius functions was tested to see if the shape of the radius had impact.

A {{numerical}} study of flow field and {{heat transfer rate}} in external flow of a novel heat exchanger (Anglia Ruskin University, 2001) was conducted. The design comprises of confined impinging jets from a staggered <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> in which the fluid flows in an opposite staggered arrangement array after impingement. The RNG k-ε model and enhanced wall treatment near wall turbulence modelling was applied to model a three-dimensional computational domain. The accuracy of the model was validated in two- and three-dimensional cases for single impinging jets with available experimental results. The arrangement of the staggered array was fixed Sn/D= 2. 1 and S p/D= 1. 6 where Sn and Sp are the distances between tubes transverse and parallel to fluid flow respectively and D was the hydraulic diameter of tubes. The dimensionless tubes to impinging surface distance (H/D) were {{in the range of}} 0. 2, 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 and the Reynolds number based on the tubes' hydraulic diameter and average fluid velocity at the exit of tubes in the range of 1000, 5000, and 20000 were studied. The global heat transfer rate on both impinging and confinement plates increased with decreasing of H/D and increasing of Reynolds number; however, the slope of increasing Reynolds number was sharper in low H/Ds. The friction factor increased with a decreasing H/D and an increasing of the Reynolds number. The local Nusselt number was studied on both impinging and confinement plates.

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{performance}} of an innovative receiver for linear Fresnel reflectors is carried out in this paper, and the results are analyzed with a physics perspective of the process. The receiver consists of a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> parallel to the mirror arrays, resulting on a smaller cross section for the same receiver width as the number of tubes increases, due to the diminution of their diameter. This implies higher heat carrier fluid speeds, and thus, a more effective heat transfer process, although it conveys higher pumping power as well. Mass flow is optimized for different tubes diameters, different impinging radiation intensities and different fluid inlet temperatures. It is found that the best receiver design, namely the tubes diameter that maximizes the exergetic efficiency for given working conditions, is similar for the cases studied. There is a range of tubes diameters that imply similar efficiencies, which can drive to capital cost reduction thanks to the flexibility of design. In addition, the length of the receiver is also optimized, and it is observed that the optimal length is similar for the working conditions considered. As a result of this study, it is found that this innovative receiver provides an optimum design for the whole day, even though impinging radiation intensity varies notably. Thermal features of this type of receiver could be the base {{of a new generation of}} concentrated solar power plants with a great potential for cost reduction, because of the simplicity of the system and the lower weigh of the components, plus the flexibility of using the receiver tubes for different streams of the heat carrier fluid...|$|E
