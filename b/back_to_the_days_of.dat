5|$|The Notitia lists {{a number}} of barbarian {{military}} settlements in the empire. Known as laeti or gentiles ("natives"), these were {{an important source of}} recruits for the army. Groups of Germanic or Sarmatian tribespeople were granted land to settle in the Empire, in return for military service. Most likely each community was under a treaty obligation to supply a specified number of troops to the army each year. The resettlement within the empire of barbarian tribespeople in return for military service was not a new phenomenon in the 4th century: it stretches <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Augustus. But it does appear that the establishment of military settlements was more systematic and on a much larger scale in the 4th century.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} that summer, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin {{reported}} that she was too frail to hold her birthday reception for the public, an annual tradition dating <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the monarchy. As one of her last public appearances in September, she officially {{became a member of the}} American Red Cross. Following several months of deteriorating health that left her without the use of her lower limbs, as well as a diminished mental capacity rendering her incapable of recognizing her own house, her inner circle of friends and caregivers sat vigil for the last two weeks of her life knowing the end was near. In accordance with Hawaiian tradition, the royal kāhili fanned her as she lay in bed. On the morning of November 11, Liliʻuokalani died at the age of seventy-nine at her residence at Washington Place.|$|E

5|$|The charter {{became part}} of English {{political}} life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling English Parliament passed new laws, it {{lost some of its}} practical significance. At the end of the 16th century there was an upsurge in interest in Magna Carta. Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the Anglo-Saxons, that protected individual English freedoms. They argued that the Norman invasion of 1066 had overthrown these rights, and that Magna Carta had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as habeas corpus. Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir Edward Coke used Magna Carta extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the divine right of kings propounded by the Stuart monarchs. Both James I and his son Charles I attempted to suppress the discussion of Magna Carta, until the issue was curtailed by the English Civil War of the 1640s and the execution of Charles.|$|E

25|$|These ploughs date <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> {{the steam}} engine and the horse. In almost {{universal}} use on farms, they have right- and left-handed mouldboards {{enabling them to}} work {{up and down the}} same furrow. Reversible ploughs may either be mounted or semi-mounted and are heavier and more expensive than right-handed models, but they have the great advantage of leaving a level surface which makes seedbed preparation and harvesting easier. Very little marking out is necessary before ploughing can start and idle running on the headland is minimal compared with conventional ploughs.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a television film in 1999, the play spent years under revision before finally opening on Broadway in 2013. Regarded as an elegy, the story harkens <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> tabloid journalism prior to the 24-hour news reporting cycle. The production received six nominations for Tony Awards, winning two, including Courtney B. Vance for Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play. The play received considerable critical comment, partly because it was Ephron's last play {{and partly because of}} Hanks's debut. Critical reaction was generally warm to mixed, and the limited Broadway run was profitable.|$|E
25|$|The Bills rivalry had {{its roots}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the AAFC, {{when there was a}} team from Buffalo with the same name in that league. The Browns and AAFC Bills played six games, {{including}} a league championship game, before the Browns were selected to merge into the NFL and the Bills left out. After the current incarnation of the Bills joined the NFL, the Browns and Bills have played each other from time to time. Though the Browns and Bills are in different AFC divisions, a mellow rivalry has since developed between the teams due to the similarities between Buffalo and Cleveland and shared misfortune between the teams. There have been some competitive moments between the Bills and Browns as well, such as a playoff game in 1990 and two games with playoff-implications in 2007 and 2014.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the municipality's flag can be traced <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the failed 1868 revolt against Spanish rule known as the Grito de Lares. The flag {{is derived from the}} Dominican Republic flag of 1844-49 (reflecting the rebel leaders' dream to {{eventually}} join with the Dominican Republic and Cuba into one nation) and was knitted by Mariana Bracetti, a revolutionary leader, at the behest of Dr. Ramón Emeterio Betances, the revolt's leader, who designed it. This flag is formed by a white Latin cross in the center. The width of the arms and base are equal to a third part of the latitude of the emblem. It has two quadrilaterals located above and two below the arms of the cross. The superior (top) ones are blue and the inferior (bottom) ones red. A five-point white star is located {{in the center of the}} left superior (top) quadrilateral.|$|E

25|$|Hanson {{was widely}} accused {{of trying to}} take Australia <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the White Australia Policy, {{particularly}} through reference to Arthur Calwell, one of the policy's strongest supporters. In her maiden address to the Australian Parliament following the 1996 election, Hanson said:I and most Australians want our immigration policy radically reviewed and that of multiculturalism abolished. I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians. Between 1984 and 1995, 40 per cent of all migrants coming into this country were of Asian origin. They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate.Hanson's remarks generated wide interest in the media both nationally and internationally, but she herself did not retain her seat in Parliament at the 1998 election or subsequent 2001 and 2004 federal elections. Hanson also failed to win election in the 2003 and 2011 New South Wales state elections. In May 2007, Hanson, with her new Pauline's United Australia Party, continued her call for a freeze on immigration, arguing that African migrants carried disease into Australia.|$|E
25|$|Claims of {{ties between}} Sabbatean Kabbalah and Sufism go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Sabbatai Zevi. This is {{largely based on}} the {{contention}} that Zevi's exile in the Balkans brought him into close contact with several forms of unorthodox Sufism which existed in the region. The Dönme community of Salonika came to {{play a significant role}} in the Sufi life of the region and its members actively involved with a number of Sufi orders, particularly the Mevlevi. Some alleged similarities between Dönme and unorthodox Sufi practice seem to exist, including the violation of kashrut/halal, sexual license, ecstatic singing, mystical interpretations of sacred scripture, and the practice of ritual meals. However, confirmed direct ties between Sabbatai Zevi and any Sufi order are conjectural and hearsay. The often claimed connection between the movement and Bektashi Sufism relies merely on circumstantial evidence and coincidence rather than any concrete substantiation. During Zevi's lifetime the Bektashi order had yet to attain widespread popularity in the Balkans; it came to dominate southern Albania only in the late 19th century. Nevertheless, there were a number of other heterodox Sufi movements in the region in the mid-17th century, including the Hamzevis, Melamis and Qalandars.|$|E
