40|$|Recent {{studies in}} higher plants or animals {{have shown that}} {{phospholipase}} D (PLD) signaling regulates many aspects of development, including organization of microtubules (MTs), actin and the endomembrane system. PLD hydrolyzes structural phospholipids to form the second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA). To {{begin to understand the}} signaling pathways and molecules that regulate cytoskeletal and endomembrane arrays during early development in the brown alga, Silvetia compressa, we altered PLD activity by applying <b>butyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> to zygotes. 1 -Butanol activates PLD and is a preferred substrate, primarily forming phosphatidyl butanol (P-butanol), which is not a signaling molecule. Treatment with 1 -butanol inhibited cell division and cytokinesis but not photopolarization or germination, suggesting an MT-based effect. Immunolabeling revealed that 1 -butanol treatment rapidly disrupted MT arrays and caused zygotes to arrest in metaphase. MT arrays recovered rapidly following butanol washout, but subsequent development depended on the timing of the treatment regime. Additionally, treatment with 1 -butanol early in development disrupted endomembrane organization, known to require functional MTs. Interestingly, treatment with higher concentrations of 2 -butanol, which also activates PLD, mimicked the effects of 1 -butanol. In contrast, the control t-butanol had no effect on MTs or development. These results indicate that S. compressa zygotes utilize PLD signaling to regulate MT arrays. In contrast, PLD signaling does not appear to regulate actin arrays or endomembrane trafficking directly.

Initial work in this project utilized a novel molybdenum sulfide catalyst previously shown to be active for hydrodesulfurization reactions of coal liquids. A pressurized fixed-bed flow-through reactor was constructed, and the MoS{sub 2 } catalysts were tested with syngas {{under a variety of}} conditions. Unfortunately, the catalysts, even with higher molybdenum loading and addition of promoters, failed to give alcohol products. A batch reactor test of the catalyst was also conducted, but did not produce alcohol products. Group VIII metals have been used previously in catalysts for syngas reactions. Ruthenium and rhodium catalysts were prepared by impregnation of a hydrotalcite support. Tests with these catalysts in flow-through reactors also did not produce the desired alcohol products. The formation of higher alcohols from smaller ones, such as methanol and ethanol, could be commercially important if high selectivity could be achieved.

Esterification rate of crude ricebran oil with methyl alcohol was studied using different volumetric ratios of alcohol to oil, different catalyst loads and catalyst types. Catalysts used were sulfuric acid at a concentration of 2 % of the oil/alcohol mixture in addition to hydrochloric acid and Amberlite IR- 120 cation exchange resin at the same molar concentration of H+ as in case of sulfuric acid. The reaction was fastest using sulfuric acid which has been then used to prepare esters of ricebran oil with methyl, ethyl, propyl and <b>butyl</b> <b>alcohols.</b> The four products have been evaluated as a fuel for diesel engines according to their fuel properties compared to regular diesel fuel.

40|$|The {{properties}} of films of carboxymethyl cellulose, CMC, of different degree of substitution, DS, {{have been examined}} {{by the use of}} perichromic indicators (probes). The film properties that have been determined are: empirical polarity, E-T(33); "acidity", alpha; "basicity", beta; and dipolarity/polarizability, pi*. This has been achieved by employing the following perichromic probes: 4 -nitroaniline, 4 -nitroanisole, 4 -nitro-N,N-dimethylaniline, and 2, 6 -dichloro- 4 -(2, 4, 6 -triphenyl-pyridinium- 1 -yl) phenolate, WB. The correlations between both E-T(33) - or pi* and DS were found to be linear; that between beta and DS is a second order polynomial; no obvious correlation was found between alpha and DS. The polarities of CMC films are in the range of those of <b>butyl</b> <b>alcohols.</b> As models for CMC, we have employed cellulose plus CMC of high DS; oxidized cellulose with degree of oxidation = 0. 5; sodium glucuronate. The former model behaved akin to CMC, but the plots of the perichromic properties versus DS showed different slopes/intercepts. FTIR data and molecular dynamics simulations on the solvation of WB have shown that this difference can be traced to more efficient hydrogen bonding between the film of the model and the probe. This affects the intra-molecular charge-transfer energy of the latter, leading to different responses to the variation of DS. Based on the excellent linear correlation between E-T(33) and DS, for CMC from different origins, we suggest that perichromism is a simple, accurate, and expedient alternative for the determination of DS of the biopolymer derivative.

40|$|Chapter 1 of {{this thesis}} gives an {{overview}} {{about the history}} of the acetone, butanol and ethanol (ABE) fermentation. The responsible solventogenic clostridia with their central metabolism are briefly discussed. Despite the fact that scientific research on the key organisms of the ABE process has continued over the past decades and even increased in recent years, still numerous aspects remain unclear. Economically, the biggest challenge within the ABE fermentation field, remains the 1 -butanol toxicity. Due to its toxicity the yield of 1 -butanol does not exceed 1 - 2 % (w/v), and only little progress has been made over the past years. Nevertheless, the ABE fermentation process became interesting again, because of the global interest in biofuels or biofuel additives. Nowadays, in an attempt to reach higher yields, other microorganisms are also being explored as hosts for the production of solvents. E. coli is often chosen as a promising host organism for the microbial production of biofuels. Nevertheless, clostridial hosts remain interesting, due to several reasons, like i) availability of a genetic system, ii) natural production of solvents and iii) relatively high tolerance towards solvents. A disadvantage of the usage of these solventogenic organisms is the inability to use cellulose and hemi-cellulose as substrate. With respect to the production of potentially interesting 1 -butanol derivatives, we focussed on 2, 3 -butanediol. This industrially valuable compound is already produced in nature by several bacteria, but not by C. acetobutylicum. In this thesis, the production of 2, 3 -butanediol by Clostridium acetobutylicum is investigated. In Chapter 1 the 2, 3 -butanediol biosynthesis pathway is extensively described. The two industrially most important and sequenced solventogenic clostridia are C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052. A lot of biochemical information is known about the various metabolic steps of the central catabolic pathway of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. In Chapter 2, comparisons are made between the pathways of both species. With the genome sequence of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 also available, likely candidates for the 34 involved enzymatic conversions within the central catabolic pathway of C. beijerinckii, could be predicted. The enzymatic conversions involved in glucose uptake, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, pyruvate conversion and acetyl-CoA conversion towards the different end products are being discussed. Chapter 3 describes and investigates a novel approach in solving the problem of the 1 -butanol toxicity towards C. acetobutylicum. Increasing of the tolerance of 1 -butanol has been tried more often in other research groups. In our approach, we chose for the introduction of new biosynthesis pathways that enable the production of less toxic 1 -butanol derivatives. The toxicity of compounds is expected to correlate with its lipophilicity, e. g. the tendency to accumulate in cell membranes. It can be expressed as the logarithm of the partition coefficient with octanol and water (log Kow value). Chapter 3 describes the growth experiments that were performed to access the toxicity of the various derivatives that were selected, viz. iso-butanol, 2 -butanol, tert-butanol, 2, 3 -butanediol, iso-amyl <b>alcohol,</b> <b>butyl</b> acetate, butyl butyrate and butyl lactate. Iso-butanol, 2 -butanol and 2, 3 -butanediol emerged as likely alternatives to 1 -butanol, based on their log Kow value and their behaviour in the toxicity test. 2, 3 -Butanediol appeared to be a potential candidate, which is less toxic to C. acetobutylicum than 1 -butanol. The precursor of 2, 3 -butanediol, acetoin, which is already produced by C. acetobutylicum in small amounts, is formed by the decarboxylation of acetolactate. The conversion is catalyzed by acetolactate decarboxylase. In Chapter 4 the identification, heterologous production, purification and biochemical characterization of a acetolactate decarboxylase from C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 is described. Ca-ALD encoded by CAC 2967 was proven to exhibit acetolactate decarboxylase activity. Size exclusion chromatography revealed that the native enzyme mainly exists as dimer of 27 kDa subunits. Optimal activity was found around 40 °C, and at pH 5. 2. The enzyme is dependent on the presence of bivalent metal ions, like Zn 2 + or Co 2 +. The half life is estimated as 25 hours at 37 °C. The Ca-ALD binds acetolactate cooperatively with a Hill coefficient of 1. 49. Also, a K 1 / 2 of 16. 8 mM and a Vmax of 51. 9 U/mg was determined. Furthermore, a shuttle vector was constructed to express Ca-ald under control of the strong adc promoter in C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. However, despite successful transformation, no significant increase in acetoin production was observed in the Ca-ALD overexpressing strain. Only one additional enzyme is needed to complete the 2, 3 -butanediol biosynthesis pathway in C. acetobutylicum. This enzyme, catalyzing the reduction of acetoin to 2, 3 -butandiol is called an acetoin reductase. Chapter 5 describes the identification, heterologous production, purification and biochemical characterization of an acetoin reductase from C. beijerinckii. A bioinformatic screening within the genome of C. beijerinckii, revealed eight putative acetoin reductases. Out of six successfully cloned genes, one (CBEI_ 1464) showed substantial acetoin reductase activity after heterologous expression in E. coli. This purified enzyme (Cb-ACR) was found to exist predominantly as homodimer of 37 kDa subunits. The enzyme has a preference for NADPH (Km = 0. 32 μM) as electron donor, with a specific activity amounting to 76 U. mg- 1. Optimal activity was found around 68 °C, for both reactions and at pH 6. 5 and 9. 5, for the reduction and oxidation reaction, respectively. ICP-AES analysis revealed the presence of ~ 2 Zn 2 + atoms and ~ 1 Ca 2 + atom per monomer. To gain insight into the reaction mechanism, but also into the substrate- and cofactor-specificity, a structural model was constructed with a ketose reductase (sorbitol dehydrogenase) from Bemisia argentifolii (silverleaf whitefly) as template. The catalytic zinc atom is likely coordinated by Cys 37, His 70, Glu 71 in Cb-ACR, while the structural zinc site is probably composed of Cys 100, Cys 103, Cys 106, and Cys 114. The acetoin reductase (Cb-ACR) found in C. beijerinckii is used for in vivo experiments in C. acetobutylicum. In Chapter 6 the production of D- 2, 3 -butanediol production in C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 by heterologous expression of Cb-ACR is described. Under certain conditions Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 (and derived strains) generates both D and L stereoisomers of acetoin, but due to the lack of an ACR enzyme, does not produce 2, 3 butanediol. A gene encoding ACR from Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 has been functionally expressed in C. acetobutylicum under control of two strong promoters, i. e. the constitutive thl promoter and the late exponential adc promoter. Both ACR-overproducing strains have been grown in batch cultures, during which 89 90 % of the natively produced acetoin has been converted to 20 22 mM D 2, 3 butanediol. Addition of a racemic mixture of acetoin did lead to the production of both, D 2, 3 butanediol and meso 2, 3 butanediol. A metabolic network is proposed that is in agreement with the experimental data. Native 2, 3 butanediol production is a first step towards a potential homo fermentative 2 butanol producing strain of C. acetobutylicum as will be discussed in this thesis...|$|R
