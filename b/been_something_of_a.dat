5|$|Historically, Ashland has <b>been</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{political}} outlier {{in southwest}} Oregon. In {{the presidential election}} of 1860, Ashland favored Abraham Lincoln while its neighbors strongly preferred pro-slavery candidates. In the early 1900s, Ashland voters supported women's suffrage and prohibition, generally {{out of step with}} the rest of the region. In more recent elections, liberal Ashland has supported tax levies and environmental regulations opposed by voters elsewhere in Jackson and nearby counties. Critics sometimes refer to the city as the People's Republic of Ashland.|$|E
5|$|Iguanodon gives {{its name}} to the unranked clade Iguanodontia, a very populous group of ornithopods with many species known from the Middle Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous. Aside from Iguanodon, the best-known members of the clade include Dryosaurus, Camptosaurus, Ouranosaurus, and the duck-bills, or hadrosaurs. In older sources, Iguanodontidae was shown as a {{distinct}} family. This family traditionally has <b>been</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wastebasket taxon, including ornithopods that were neither hypsilophodontids or hadrosaurids. In practice, animals like Callovosaurus, Camptosaurus, Craspedodon, Kangnasaurus, Mochlodon, Muttaburrasaurus, Ouranosaurus, and Probactrosaurus were usually assigned to this family.|$|E

25|$|The exact date {{on which}} Port Victor was {{converted}} into a refrigeration ship is not known, but {{it is known that}} ships of the Anglo-Australian Line, including Port Victor, began to transport apples and pears from Tasmania to Britain in about 1891, suggesting the conversion took place around this time. As marine refrigeration was still in its infancy, this particular venture seems to have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hit-and-miss affair, with some fruit shipments arriving in Britain in good condition and others not.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{there has}} <b>been</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> revival in Danish theatre. Many new playwrights and {{producers}} have appeared including Astrid Saalbach (born 1955), {{winner of the}} Nordic Drama Award in 2004, and Peter Asmussen (born 1957), who wrote the film script for Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves. Danish musicals have also been a particularly successful feature of the modern theatre. Knud Christensen, commonly known as Sebastian, was particularly successful with Cyrano (1992), based on Rostand’s play and Klokkeren fra Notre Dame (The Hunchback of Notre Dame) (2001). Bent Fabricius-Bjerre's musical Matador (2007) {{is based on a}} successful TV series of the same name.|$|E
25|$|In the mid- to late-1990s, San Francisco {{grew more}} prosperous and its {{population}} expanded {{with the advent}} of the dot-com boom, and the Metro system began to feel the strain of increased commuter demand. Muni criticism had <b>been</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> feature of life in San Francisco, and not without reason. The Boeing trains were sub-par and grew crowded quickly. And the difficulty in running a hybrid streetcar and light rail system, with five lines merging into one, led to scheduling problems on the main trunk lines with long waits between arrivals and commuter-packed trains sometimes sitting motionless in tunnels for extended periods of time.|$|E

25|$|Somerled was slain in 1164 at the Battle of Renfrew, amidst an {{invasion}} of mainland Scotland, commanding forces drawn from all over his kingdom. The reasons for his attack are unknown. He may have wished to nullify Scottish encroachment, but the scale of his venture suggests that he nursed greater ambitions. On his death, Somerled's vast kingdom disintegrated, although his sons retained much of the southern Hebridean portion. Compared to his immediate descendants, who associated themselves with reformed religious orders, Somerled may have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> religious traditionalist. In {{the last year of}} his life, he attempted to persuade the head of the Columban monastic community, Flaithbertach Ua Brolcháin, Abbot of Derry, to relocate from Ireland to Iona, a sacred island within Somerled's sphere of influence. Unfortunately for Somerled, his demise denied him the ecclesiastical reunification he sought, and decades later his descendants oversaw the obliteration of the island's Columban monastery. Iona's oldest surviving building, St Oran's Chapel, dates to the mid-12th century, and may have been built by Somerled or his family.|$|E
25|$|If 1936 had <b>been</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{disappointment}} 1937 {{started with}} great success. Wickets came {{in virtually every}} innings and with his 4 wickets against Derbyshire at Taunton he had reached 100 wickets for the season by 15 July, the earliest any Somerset player has reached 100 first-class wickets. Having also scored over 700 runs at this point Andrews must surely {{have been in the}} reckoning for either the Players or even a Test place against the New Zealanders. Wellard was selected for the Players at Lord's and later played a single Test against the tourists. Wellard's 1937 figures were no better than Andrews's but he had had a much better 1936 than Andrews. Andrews performances fell away later in the season but he still finished with 137 wickets for Somerset at an average under 20 and with 1000 runs at an average over 20 he completed the double, even achieving it in Championship matches alone. The highlight of the season was the match against Surrey at The Oval. On the third morning Somerset had just avoided following-on and when Surrey batting again they were dismissed for 35 in 13.4 overs. Andrews took 8-12 including a hat-trick. Despite a rapid 91* from Wellard Somerset lost by 11 runs.|$|E

500|$|Film scholar Peter Hames has {{summarized}} three {{themes of}} Loves of a Blonde {{that have been}} discussed repeatedly in critical writings on the film, themes that have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> constant throughout Forman's career: [...] "the impermanence of young love, the confusion and despair of middle age, and the gulf between the generations". [...] Another theme that is often identified involves the awkwardness and confusion surrounding sex in a repressed society. Most critics have also commented on the confluence of comedy and sadness in the film's depiction of everyday life in a totalitarian state, [...] although while some consider Loves of a Blonde Forman's most pointed critique of Czech society under communism, others {{point out that the}} grim conditions are not solely due to misguided public policy, but that individuals create their own isolation as well.|$|E
500|$|In 1937 {{there were}} two events of huge {{importance}} in Britten's life: his mother died, and he met the tenor Peter Pears. Although Britten was extraordinarily devoted {{to his mother and}} was devastated at her death, it also seems to have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> liberation for him. Only after that did he begin to engage in emotional relationships with people his own age or younger. Later in the year he got to know Pears while they were both helping to clear out the country cottage of a mutual friend who had died in an air crash. Pears quickly became Britten's musical inspiration and close (though for the moment platonic) friend. Britten's first work for him was composed within weeks of their meeting, a setting of Emily Brontë's poem, [...] "A thousand gleaming fires", for tenor and strings.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} for the DVD single, Alex Castle of IGN gave the music {{a score of}} 9 out of 10, writing [...] "the thing sounds fantastic" [...] and that the song is [...] "pretty good". However, he {{admitted}} that he [...] "would probably not have been particularly impressed" [...] if he hadn't seen the music video. James Oldham of NME described it as [...] "magnificent, sultry, pneumatic trip-soul ballad, which gently blooms into a magical garden of fluttering harps and shivering strings." [...] He also added that the track [...] "is no mere soundtrack" [...] for the video. AllMusic's Heather Phares gave the DVD single four out of five stars, considering it [...] "a necessary addition to the collections of dedicated Bjork fans". Douglas Wolk of CMJ New Music Monthly also gave the single a positive review, commending its B-sides and writing it [...] "was hardly the most striking piece at the time—but the tune turns out to have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sleeper." ...|$|E
500|$|Russell {{refused to}} attend the {{ceremony}} when his #6 jersey was retired in 1972, or his induction into the Hall of Fame in 1975. While Russell still has sore feelings towards the city, there has <b>been</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reconciliation; and he has even visited the city regularly in recent years, something he never did {{in the years immediately}} after his retirement. When Russell originally retired, he demanded that his jersey be retired in an empty Boston Garden. In 1995, the Celtics left Boston Garden and entered the FleetCenter, now the TD Garden, and as the main festive act, the Boston organization wanted to re-retire Russell's jersey in front of a sellout audience. Perennially wary of what he long perceived as the racist city of Boston, Russell decided to make amends and gave his approval. On May 6, 1999, the Celtics re-retired Russell's jersey in a ceremony attended by his on-court rival (and friend) Chamberlain, along with Celtics legend Larry Bird and Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The crowd gave Russell a prolonged standing ovation, which brought tears to his eyes. He thanked Chamberlain for taking him to the limit and [...] "making [...] a better player" [...] and the crowd for [...] "allowing [...] {{to be a part of}} their lives." [...] In December 2008, the We Are Boston Leadership Award was presented to Russell.|$|E
500|$|In 1977, Davis Publications {{launched}} Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, {{and after}} Bova's departure, Joel Davis, {{the owner of}} Davis Publications, contacted Condé Nast {{with a view to}} acquiring Analog. [...] Analog had always <b>been</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> misfit in Condé Nast's line up, which included Mademoiselle and Vogue, and by February 1980 the deal was agreed. [...] The first issue published by Davis was dated September 1980. [...] Davis was willing to put some effort into marketing Analog, so Schmidt regarded the change as likely to be beneficial, and in fact circulation quickly grew, reversing a gradual decline over the Bova years, from just over 92,000 in 1981 to almost 110,000 two years later. [...] Starting with the first 1981 issue, Davis switched Analog to a four-weekly schedule, rather than monthly, to align the production schedule with a weekly calendar. [...] Instead of being dated [...] "January 1981", the first issue under the new regime was dated [...] "January 5, 1981", but this approach led to newsstands removing the magazine much more quickly, since the date gave the impression that it was a weekly magazine. [...] The cover date was changed back to the current month starting with the April 1982 issue, but the new schedule remained in place, with a [...] "Mid-September" [...] issue in 1982 and 1983, and [...] "Mid-December" [...] issues {{for more than a decade}} thereafter. [...] Circulation trended slowly down over the 1980s, to 83,000 for the year ending in 1990; by this time the great majority of readers were subscribers, as newsstand sales declined to only 15,000.|$|E
