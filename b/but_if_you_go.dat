25|$|To my {{knowledge}} {{there is only}} one top-flight professional gay footballer who came out â€“ Justin Fashanu. He ended up committing suicide. I have been advising a top premiership star who is bisexual. If it came out that he had gay tendencies, his career would be over in two minutes. Should it be? No, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on the terraces and hear the way fans are, and also, that kind of general attitude that goes with football, it's almost like going back to the dark ages.|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} soundtrack for Watchmen, {{director}} Zack Snyder {{decided to go}} with covers instead of original songs, saying [...] "If you go with the original song, you just get the moment. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> with covers you also {{get all of the}} baggage you bring to it, [...] I like the baggage. It kind of resonates and rings across time, it's not just of the moment." [...] The soundtrack was produced by composer Tyler Bates and musical producer Marius de Vries. While Bates' job was initially only writing a musical score and helping the song transitions, the composer ended working closely with de Vries as [...] "the songs and the score just began bleeding into one another" [...] - the only track in which de Vries worked alone was the remix of [...] "Army of Me".|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Evangelical {{journalist}} Richard Abanes, who {{has written}} several books arguing against new religions and Mormonism, published a polemical text that made similar allegations to the video: Harry Potter and the Bible: The Menace Behind the Magick. Later editions incorporated comparisons and contrasts between Harry Potter and the more overtly Christian works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. In an interview with CBN.com, Abanes remarked that, [...] "One of the easiest ways to know whether a fantasy book or film has real world magick in it is to just ask a simple question, 'Can my child find information in a library or bookstore that {{will enable them to}} replicate what they are seeing in the film or the book?' If you go to The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings what you see in, story magic and imagination, it is not real. You can't replicate it. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to something like Harry Potter, you can find references to astrology, clairvoyance, and numerology. It takes seconds to go into a bookstore or library and get books on that and start investigating it, researching it, and doing it." ...|$|E

"Moreover, Albert, you cannot but {{be proud}} of the name your father and those before him have won by their gallant deeds, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> into the Church {{it would no longer}} appear in the roll of the knights of England. It would be ill indeed that a line of knights, who have so well played their part on every battle-field since your {{ancestor}} came over with the Conqueror, should become extinct." ...|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Guardian Glover stated, [...] "I'm influenced by LCD Soundsystem as much as Ghostface Killah. A lot of the rap shows I saw as a kid were boring, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> to a Rage show or a Justice show, the kids were losing their minds. Kids {{just want to go}} nuts, Odd Future know that. People want to experience something physical." [...] He has also spoken of his being influenced by Salvador Dali.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> slick {{off when}} Redskins are rampagin' around, you'll {{be sure to}} get nabbed an' roasted alive, an' so you'll never deliver your letters." ...|$|E
60|$|Poor people, You see I have {{no power}} with the Duke, <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> into the court without, My almoner shall from my private purse, Divide a hundred ducats 'mongst you all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. I doubt it, {{as far as}} you're concerned; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> away now, you {{certainly}} won't live with me again, for I shall not let you come back. Understand that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Three places. Arm, shoulder, {{and a bad}} one in the breast. It {{got your}} lung, I'm afraid. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>go</b> quick, you've a chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In their ways, {{in their}} places--Yes. <b>But</b> not <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> {{up to them}} and look at them. Not at the dinner table, not in their beds.... What a time of disillusionment you must have had! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} fancy you {{are well}} enough, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> must <b>go,</b> I wonder whether {{you would do}} a good turn to Alfreton?" [...] she said. [...] "The lad has been speculating--and he seems anxious lately." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{may have}} had twenty, Henry, for what I know; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to that gentleman, he can {{tell you all about}} it. Go speak to him, Henry; it is the Master of Ravenswood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's possible," [...] said Stannard. [...] "I didn't {{engage to}} lend you ammunition, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to the barn, you'll find a brown valise. Bring me the valise and I may {{find you a}} box of cartridges." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nott {{regarded}} {{him with an}} expression of patronizing superiority. [...] "That's what we ladled out to the public gin'rally, and to Ferrers and his gang in partickler. We said Petalumey, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to Madrono Cottage, San Rafael, you'll find Rosey thar." ...|$|E
60|$|THE matron {{had given}} her leave to go {{out as soon as}} the women's tea was over and Maria looked forward to her evening out. The kitchen was spick and span: the cook said you could see {{yourself}} in the big copper boilers. The fire was nice and bright and on one of the side-tables were four very big barmbracks. These barmbracks seemed uncut; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> closer <b>you</b> would see that they had been cut into long thick even slices and were ready to be handed round at tea. Maria had cut them herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} fancy you {{are well}} enough, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> must <b>go,</b> I wonder whether {{you would do}} a good turn to Alfreton?" [...] she said. [...] "The lad has been speculating and he seems anxious lately." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{impossible}} to talk quietly here," [...] he whispered. [...] "I am very busy. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could <b>go</b> {{and wait for}} me in my house. It's less than ten minutes' walk. Oh, yes, you don't know the way." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> (as {{more and}} more of you will go) into the great towns, you will hear much noisy and violent {{speaking}} from pulpits, and at public meetings. You will read much noisy and violent writing in newspapers and books.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not {{difficult}} to do, if we have time--if we have to-morrow morning, and early. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to Gaydene you will hardly return to-night, and I shall lose my chance,--and yet it is to me a business most precious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know all}} about it. Of course you have not stolen them, {{and of course there}} was nothing to steal. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on calling her Maria you'll find that he'll have a pull on you. Men don't call other men's wives names for nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{was just}} sending Tony after it. <b>But,</b> father, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> up to Moore's camp, don't say {{too much about}} what has happened. Don't tell them just when you took the back-trail, and just how long Wayland and I were in camp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, I {{am sorry}} you are going, very sorry, Charlie; <b>but,</b> even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> {{altogether}} {{on to the}} staff, I shall see {{a good deal of}} you, for, as the king is always with the army, this must be your headquarters still.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps {{you think}} that fishes were always fishes, and never lived {{anywhere}} except in the water, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> to Australia {{and talked to the}} black people in the sandy desert in the centre of the country, you would learn something quite different. They would tell you that long, long ago you would have met fishes on the land, wandering from place to place, and hunting all sorts of animals, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> consider how fishes are made, you will understand how difficult this must have been and how clever they were to do it. Indeed, so clever were they that they might have been hunting still if a terrible thing had not happened.|$|R
6000|$|Morton laughed, rather sadly. [...] "That's a fine, womanly reason, {{and may be}} {{sufficient}} for you; <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go,</b> understand, Kate, it is against my wish. I do not care to know anything more about her and her problems; she has interfered too much with my work already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{now he is}} Reggie Burke, keener on polo than on {{anything}} else, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to the Sind and Sialkote Bank tomorrow you would find Mr. Reginald Burke a very capable man of business, known and liked by an immense constituency North and South of this." ...|$|E

"And see, James," [...] said Mr. Henry, [...] "if I go, and the Prince has {{the upper}} hand, {{it will be}} easy to make your peace with King James. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go,</b> and the {{expedition}} fails, we divide {{the right and the}} title.

2500|$|Approximately {{three dozen}} {{people came to}} the 1st Golden Raspberry Awards. The 2nd Golden Raspberry Awards had double the {{attendance}} as the first, and the 3rd awards ceremony had double this number. By the 4th Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony, CNN and two major wire services covered the event. Wilson realized that by scheduling the Golden Raspberry Awards prior to the Academy Awards, the ceremony would get more press coverage: [...] "We finally figured out you couldn't compete with the Oscars on Oscar night, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> the night before, when the press {{from all over the}} world are here and they are looking for something to do, it could well catch on," [...] he said to BBC News.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, let me {{warn you}} to keep your distance," [...] said Dick sternly. [...] "If you don't, you'll regret it. We have been very easy {{with you in the}} past, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> too far, I, for one, will be for putting you where your father is, in prison." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot die. I {{would stay}} {{to look upon}} the sun, not for my own sake, but because of our child that will be born. Nor can I fly with you, since then your boat will be stopped. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> alone, the guards will let it pass. They have their commands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Brindisi mail leaves to-morrow night, Captain, if {{you travel}} by Egypt, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> by Tunis, 7.15 a.m. Saturday {{is the time}} from Charing Cross. Only, as I {{understand}} that high explosives and arms have to be provided, these might take awhile to lay in and pack so as to deceive customs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, boy," [...] {{interrupted}} his father, [...] "I {{will not}} listen to your reasons. I have heard them often enough--too often--and they are foolish, false, utterly inconclusive. <b>You</b> may <b>go</b> to Jericho as far as I am concerned; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do <b>go,</b> <b>you</b> shall never darken my doors again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then that's all right," [...] said Ann briskly. [...] "I {{was afraid}} {{that you might not}} approve. <b>But,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do, I'll <b>go</b> right ahead." ...|$|R
