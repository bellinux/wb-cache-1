5|$|Any {{model of}} the origin of Siletzia must account for {{interactions}} with plate <b>boundaries</b> <b>that</b> were being subducted under North America through the Eocene. Early studies were plagued by indeterminate locations for these boundaries, particularly of the Kula-Farallon (K-F) spreading ridge: basalts {{at the head of the}} Gulf of Alaska (along the Alaska panhandle) have ages and compositions corresponding to the Siletz volcanics, suggesting that the K-F ridge was offshore of the Yukon at the same time it was offshore of Washington. This can be resolved by assuming that by about 56 Ma the eastern part of the Kula plate had broken away to form the Resurrection plate, with the new Kula-Resurrection (K-R) spreading ridge running up the Gulf of Alaska towards Kodiak Island, and the former K-F (now R-F) ridge reaching Washington. Subduction of this plate under western Canada was rapid, and it disappeared entirely with subduction of the K-R ridge about 50 Ma.|$|E

For example, Birmingham's interstate highway system attempted to maintain the racial <b>boundaries</b> <b>that</b> had been established by the city's 1926 racial zoning law. The construction of interstate highways through black neighborhoods in the city led to significant population loss in those neighborhoods and is associated {{with an increase in}} neighborhood racial segregation.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} {{moments of}} atoms in a ferromagnetic material {{cause them to}} behave something like tiny permanent magnets.

25|$|Throughout history, {{different}} states designate the groups within their <b>boundaries</b> <b>that</b> {{are recognized as}} indigenous peoples according to international or national legislation by different terms. Indigenous people also include people indigenous based on their descent from populations that inhabited the country when non-indigenous religions and cultures arrived—or at the establishment of present state boundaries—who retain {{some or all of}} their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions, but who may have been displaced from their traditional domains or who may have resettled outside their ancestral domains.|$|E
25|$|The {{region that}} became Michigan was {{initially}} unorganized territory and essentially remained under British control; {{that did not}} stop Arthur St. Clair, the first Governor of the Northwest Territory, from establishing a structure of government for the area, if only on paper. Knox County was established on June 20, 1790 with <b>boundaries</b> <b>that</b> included the western half of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan and roughly the middle third of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In 1792, the boundaries of Hamilton County were expanded to include the eastern portions of Michigan not included in Knox County.|$|E
25|$|The Council is a unicameral body {{consisting}} of 51 Council members, whose districts {{are defined by}} geographic population <b>boundaries</b> <b>that</b> each contain approximately 157,000 people. Council members are elected every four years, except that after every census held in years divisible by twenty, districts are redrawn, requiring two consecutive two-year terms, the second of which is held in the redrawn districts. The Speaker of the Council, selected by the 51 Council members, is often considered the second most powerful post in New York City's government after the Mayor.|$|E

25|$|The General Act of the Berlin Conference {{required}} disputes {{to go to}} arbitration and issuing the Ultimatum was {{a breach}} of this rule. After the Ultimatum Portugal asked for arbitration, but because the 1875 Delagoa Bay arbitration had been in favour of Portugal, Lord Salisbury refused and demanded a bi-lateral treaty. Talks started in Lisbon in April 1890, and in May the Portuguese delegation proposed joint administration of the disputed area between Angola and Mozambique. The British government refused this, and drafted a treaty that imposed <b>boundaries</b> <b>that</b> were generally unfavourable to Portugal.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{attenuation}} {{results from}} the incoherent scattering of light at internal surfaces and interfaces. In (poly)crystalline materials such as metals and ceramics, in addition to pores, most of the internal surfaces or interfaces are {{in the form of}} grain <b>boundaries</b> <b>that</b> separate tiny regions of crystalline order. It has recently been shown that when the size of the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent. This phenomenon has given rise to the production of transparent ceramic materials.|$|E
