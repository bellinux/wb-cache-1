25|$|Other {{methods include}} {{shrinkage}} stope mining, which is mining upward, creating a sloping underground room, long wall mining, which is grinding a long ore surface underground, and {{room and pillar}} mining, which is removing ore from rooms while leaving pillars in place to support {{the roof of the}} room. Room and pillar mining often leads to retreat mining, in which supporting pillars are removed as miners retreat, allowing the room to cave in, thereby loosening more ore. Additional sub-surface mining methods include hard rock mining, which is mining of hard rock (igneous, metamorphic or sedimentary) materials, bore hole mining, drift and fill mining, long hole slope mining, sub level caving, and <b>block</b> <b>caving.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of fragmentation {{is an important}} aspect of the design and planning of any excavation. The distribution of fragment sizes in situ helps assess the requirement of explosive energy to excavate the rock material. In addition, the information {{can also be used to}} evaluate the ground water flow, leaching characteristics and the requirement of additional rock handling equipment in construction projects. In the <b>block</b> <b>cave</b> mining method, the {{assessment of}} in situ and secondary fragmentation is an integral part of the design of the excavations at the extraction level and the selection of material handling systems for transporting the ore to the processing stations. Secondary blasting requirements can also be estimated based on the fragment size distributions developed for the <b>block</b> <b>cave.</b> Methods of estimating fragment size distributions in <b>block</b> <b>cave</b> mines have been based on joint set parameters estimated from structural mapping in available excavations or outcrops. While this is acceptable in the absence of any other means of assessing the fragmentation, the results can often be misleading since the structural mapping is often carried out in limited areas and the results applied uniformly to the entire deposit. This new study proposes to use the core piece lengths information gathered from the boreholes to develop in situ and primary fragmentation estimates for <b>block</b> <b>cave</b> operations. Under this proposed study, drill core piece lengths from an exploration program in Indonesia will be used along with structural mapping data to develop estimates for in situ and primary fragment size distributions. Methods for estimating secondary fragmentation from primary fragmentation will be evaluated and the estimates of secondary fragmentation from the different methods will be compared with the actual fragmentation characteristics observed at the drawpoints. The primary assumption in the development of primary fragment size distributions from drill core data is that each drill hole piece represents one in situ rock block. The relationships between the joint spacings and lengths of the different joint sets, evaluated from the joint set characteristics gathered from available excavations, outcrops or oriented core drilling programs, can be utilized for estimating the shape of the rock blocks...|$|R

40|$|The Black Mountain {{porphyry}} Cu-Au deposit {{is located}} in the central-western portion of the Baguio mineral district, Philippines, approximately six kilometers southwest of Baguio City in the Upper Bued River. It consists of two orebodies hosted within the Black Mountain Intrusive Complex (BMIC). The 'Main' or 'Kennon' orebody occurs at the northwest end of the elongate intrusive complex. Main was <b>block</b> <b>caved</b> from 1969 1983 and had a preproduction reserve of 47 Mt at 0. 38 % Cu and 0. 35 g/t Au + 0. 01 % Mo.

40|$|The mining {{industry}} can greatly benefit from automation. A {{great deal of}} {{work has been done}} on this subject and is still ongoing. With automation comes the possibility for optimization, because more information is available, and actions can be repeated with more accuracy. Many factors in an underground environment make mining automation a challenging prospect. These factors include the difficulty and cost of installing the needed infrastructure. The work described in this dissertation focuses on a mining setup where vehicles such as LHDs and trucks are used to collect and transport ore underground. Considerable {{progress has been made in}} automating underground vehicles, and successful tests have been done underground. The next obvious step is to find ways of using the increased data to optimize the decisions that are made with regards to the dispatching of the vehicles. Possible solutions to the problem of optimizing the autonomous vehicle dispatch system in an underground mine are investigated. Possible optimization strategies are evaluated using a simulated environment. In the simulated environment a <b>block</b> <b>cave</b> mine is modelled, and the simulation setup is discussed in detail. The operation of a <b>block</b> <b>cave</b> mine as it is operated currently is simulated to obtain a benchmark for the evaluation of further results.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the past}} various {{systems have been}} used to plan the {{extraction}} of ore from <b>block</b> <b>cave</b> operations. These systems have varied from rather sophisticated models with empirical “gravity flow ” rules applied to the very rudimentary models where only the recorded mined tonnage’s have been accounted for against the available resource. The normal requirement of these models has been to only plan the movement of ground through the drawpoints. Little cognisance has been taken of the other parameters that affect the total mining operations. The intended purpose of the linear program planning system is to not only include the management, resource availability and geotechnical constraints, but to also include the mining rules. The paper will discuss the various constraints that have been considered, and attempt to illustrate where the system better serves the production system than previous ones. A brief technical discussion on the linear programming system is included. 1...|$|R

Kaiser 5 This paper reports the findings from a benchmark study testing several numerical methods, {{with a focus on}} the influence of undercut depth on block caving-induced surface deformation. A comparison is drawn between continuum v. discontinuum treatments of the modelled geology. Results were evaluated with respect to different simulated levels of ground disturbance, from complete collapse to small-strain subsidence. The results show that for a given extraction volume, the extent of ground collapse at surface decreases as undercut depth increases. The presence of sub-vertical faults was seen to limit the extent of the modelled caving zones. In contrast, the extent of small-strain surface subsidence was seen to increase with increasing undercut depth. The faults in this case did not have the same limiting effect. Overall, the findings emphasise the importance of balancing model simplification against the need to incorporate more complex and computationally demanding representations of the rock mass structure...|$|R
