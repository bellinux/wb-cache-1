5|$|Relative {{to their}} high standards, UConn {{struggled}} {{during the first}} two years following Taurasi's graduation in 2004. Some of its highly touted recruits did not play up to expectations while others suffered injuries. Taken together during the three years 2005–2007, UConn never made a Final Four, something that has <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> routine (17 final fours in 22 years from 1995 to 2016).|$|E
5|$|Cells of {{the genus}} Azotobacter are {{relatively}} large for bacteria (1–2 μm in diameter). They are usually oval, but may take various forms from rods to spheres. In microscopic preparations, the cells can be dispersed or form irregular clusters or occasionally chains of varying lengths. In fresh cultures, cells are mobile due to the numerous flagella. Later, the cells lose their mobility, <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> spherical, and produce {{a thick layer of}} mucus, forming the cell capsule. The shape of the cell is affected by the amino acid glycine which is present in the nutrient medium peptone.|$|E
5|$|The {{aesthetic}} and technical mastery of Borobudur, and also its sheer size, has evoked {{the sense of}} grandeur and pride for Indonesians. Just like Angkor Wat for Cambodian, Borobudur has become a powerful symbol for Indonesia — to testify for its past greatness. Sukarno {{made a point of}} showing the site to foreign dignitaries. The Suharto regime — realized its important symbolic and economic meanings — diligently embarked on a massive project to restore the monument with the help from UNESCO. Many museums in Indonesia contain a scale model replica of Borobudur. The monument has <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> an icon, grouped with the wayang puppet play and gamelan music into a vague classical Javanese past from which Indonesians are to draw inspiration.|$|E

5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Turkey is characterised by achievements and challenges. Over the past decades access to drinking water has <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> universal {{and access to}} adequate sanitation has also increased substantially. Autonomous utilities have been created in the 16 metropolitan cities of Turkey and cost recovery has been increased, thus providing {{the basis for the}} sustainability of service provision. Intermittent supply, which was common in many cities, has become less frequent. In 2004, 61% of the wastewater collected through sewers was being treated. Remaining challenges include the need to further increase wastewater treatment, to reduce the high level of non-revenue water hovering around 50% and to expand access to adequate sanitation in rural areas. The investment required to comply with EU standards in the sector, especially in wastewater treatment, is estimated to be in the order of €2 billion per year, more than double the current level of investment.|$|E
5|$|Arrangements devised in 1963 between 'Aflaq and the Military Committee {{led to a}} {{very close}} mutual {{involvement}} {{of the military and}} civilian sectors of the regime, so {{that by the end of}} 1965 the politics of the Syrian army had <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> identical to the politics of the Ba'th Party. The principle military protagonist of the period Hafiz, J'did, and 'Umran were no longer on military service and their power depended on their intermediary supporters in the army and in the party. In November 1965, the National Command issued a resolution which stated it was forbidden for the Regional Command to transfer or dismiss military officers without the consent of the National Command. After hearing of the resolution, Jadid rebelled immediately, and ordered Colonel Mustafa Tlas to arrest the commanders of the Homs garrison and his deputy, both supporters of National Command. In response, Razzaz called for an emergency session of the National Command which decreed the Regional Command dissolved, and made Bitar Prime Minister. Hafiz was made Chairman of a new Presidential Council and Shibli al-Aysami his deputy. Umran was recalled from exile and reappointed to the office of Minister of Defence and commander-in-chief, and Mansur al-Atrash was appointed Chairman of a new and expanded National Revolutionary Council. Jadid and his supporters responded by making war on the National Command. Assad, who neither liked nor had sympathy for the Aflaqites, did not support a showdown through the use of force. In response to the coming coup, Assad, along with Naji Jamil, Husayn Mulhim and Yusuf Sayigh, left for London.|$|E

The very first scanning of the now ubiquitous Universal Product Code (UPC) barcode was on a pack of Wrigley Company chewing gum in June 1974.|$|E
25|$|The Cumberland Valley was {{dotted with}} Scottish-Irish {{settlements}} throughout its entire area, a district which had <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> exclusively {{the possession of}} this racial group, with whom were mingled small numbers of English and German settlers constituting perhaps {{ten percent of the}} population. It was well adapted to farming, and the Scottish-Irish, in this early period, were mostly farmers, but later they developed a marked aptitude for trade and the professions.|$|E

25|$|The Order of Free Gardeners is a {{fraternal society}} that {{was founded in}} Scotland {{in the middle of}} the 17th century and later spread to England and Ireland. Like {{numerous}} other friendly societies of the time, its principal aim was the sharing of secret knowledge linked to the profession and mutual aid. In the 19th century, its activities of mutual insurance became predominant. By the end of the 20th century, it had <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> entirely extinct.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of fine synthetic fibres such as nylon {{in the construction}} of fishing gear during the 1960s marked an expansion in the commercial use of gillnets. The new materials were cheaper and easier to handle, lasted longer and required less maintenance than natural fibres. In addition, multifilament nylon, monofilament or multimonofilament fibres <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> invisible in water, so nets made with synthetic twines generally caught greater numbers of fish than natural fibre nets used in comparable situations.|$|E
25|$|Standard housing also expanded: By 1968 {{there were}} many new side streets, in {{particular}} a new estate encompassed by Pilgrim Avenue; development along Pelham Road had <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> continuous, and the new village now expanding northwest towards the old Immingham. Further growth {{took place in the}} late 1960 and 1970s: northwest of Pelham Road, with the village continuous towards Church Lane; a new estate southeast of Pilgrim Road; as well as further infilling to the southwest.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, housing estates {{were built}} along Garvaghy Road. In 1969, Northern Ireland was {{plunged into a}} {{conflict}} known as the Troubles. Portadown underwent major population shifts; these new estates <b>became</b> <b>almost</b> wholly Catholic, {{while the rest of}} the town's estates <b>became</b> <b>almost</b> wholly Protestant. Many Orangemen joined the Northern Ireland security forces: the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the British Army's Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR).|$|R

The public face of Blue Book {{continued}} to be the official Air Force investigation of UFOs, but the reality was it had essentially been reduced to doing very little serious investigation, and had <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> solely a public relations outfit with a debunking mandate. To cite one example, {{by the end of}} 1956, the number of cases listed as unsolved had dipped to barely 0.4 percent, from the 20 to 30% only a few years earlier.|$|E

25|$|In the Niayes {{region of}} Senegal, a coastal area close to Dakar, {{livestock}} keeping was difficult {{due to the}} presence of a population of Glossina palpalis gambiensis. Feasibility studies indicated that the fly population was confined to very fragmented habitats and a population genetics study indicated that the population was genetically isolated from the main tsetse belt in the south eastern part of Senegal. After completion of the feasibility studies (2006–2010), an area-wide integrated eradication campaign that included an SIT component was started in 2011, and by 2015, the Niayes region had <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> tsetse fly free.|$|E
25|$|A core {{standard}} valve layout {{based on}} the action of three valves had <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> universal by (at latest) 1864 as witnessed by Arban's Method published in that year.

The most common four-valve layout is a superset of the well-established 3-valve layout and is noted in the table, despite the exposition of four-valve and also five-valve systems (the latter used on the tuba) being incomplete in this article.|$|E

Modigliani's behaviour at this time sheds some light upon his developing style as an artist, in that the studio had <b>become</b> <b>almost</b> a sacrificial effigy for all that he resented about the academic art that had marked {{his life and his}} training up to that point.|$|E
