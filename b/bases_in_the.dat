5|$|The USAAF <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mariana Islands {{were within}} range {{of a number of}} Japanese air <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific. These {{included}} Wake Island to the east, Truk and the Gilbert and Marshall Islands to the southeast, Woleai to the south and Yap to the southwest. To the north the Japanese had air <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nampo Shoto chain of islands and Bonin Islands, which included three airstrips on Iwo Jima. Several of the minor islands in the Mariana chain also remained in Japanese hands, and there were airfields on Rota and Pagan. The Japanese were unable to use most of these bases, however, as they had been isolated and heavily damaged by United States air attacks, and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (IJAAF) and Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had relatively few aircraft and pilots available.|$|E
5|$|Initially in the United Kingdom {{there were}} a few American Cockers that had {{accompanied}} service personnel to American <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s and 1960s. In addition, several came over with embassy staff and business people returning home.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, Sihanouk's {{delicate}} {{domestic and foreign}} policy balancing act was beginning to go awry. In 1966, an agreement was struck between the prince and the Chinese, allowing the presence of large-scale PAVN and Viet Cong troop deployments and logistical <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern border regions. He had also agreed to allow the use of the port of Sihanoukville by communist-flagged vessels delivering supplies and material to support the PAVN/Viet Cong military effort in South Vietnam. These concessions made questionable Cambodia's neutrality, which had been guaranteed by the Geneva Conference of 1954.|$|E
5|$|Crete {{had been}} the target of Muslim attacks since the first wave of the Muslim conquests in the mid-7th century. It had {{suffered}} a first raid in 654 and again in 674/675, and parts of the island were temporarily occupied during the reign of the Umayyad Caliph al-Walid I (r. 705–715). Nevertheless, the island was never conquered and despite occasional raids in the 8th century it remained securely in Byzantine hands; Crete was too far from the Arab naval <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Levant for an effective expedition against it to be undertaken.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the rapid}} Muslim conquests of the 7th century, the Byzantine Empire found itself {{confined}} to Asia Minor, the southern coasts of the Balkans, {{and parts of}} Italy. As Byzantium remained the Caliphate's major infidel enemy, Arab raids into Asia Minor continued throughout the 8th and 9th centuries. Over time, these expeditions, launched from <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arab frontier zone on an almost annual basis, acquired a quasi-ritualized character {{as part of the}} Muslim jihad (holy war).|$|E
5|$|In 1913–1914 two Kaiser-class ships, Kaiser and König Albert {{took part}} in a major {{overseas}} tour to South America and South Africa.

5|$|In 1942 Fleming {{attended}} an Anglo-American intelligence summit in Jamaica and, despite the constant heavy rain during his visit, {{he decided to}} live on the island once the war was over. His friend Ivar Bryce helped find a plot of land in Saint Mary Parish where, in 1945, Fleming had a house built, which he named Goldeneye. The name of the house and estate has many possible sources. Fleming mentioned both his wartime Operation Goldeneye and Carson McCullers' 1941 novel Reflections in a Golden Eye, which described the use of British naval <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean by the US Navy.|$|E

5|$|In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases {{make copies}} of DNA polynucleotide chains. To {{preserve}} biological information, {{it is essential that}} the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.|$|E
5|$|In May 1934, {{following}} {{reports of}} a Japanese spy operating out of Dutch Harbor, the United States Navy dispatched Edwin T. Layton to the Aleutians to investigate the allegations. The result {{of this investigation was}} the arrest of the only Japanese man in the region, as well as the town's only prostitute, a woman accused of conspiring with the Japanese man. During the 1930s, a number of United States governmental committees, boards and reports concluded that air <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Aleutians would be for the most part impractical due to the region's inclement weather.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944 the United States Twentieth Air Force's XXI Bomber Command {{prepared}} to conduct strategic bombing raids on the Japanese home islands from <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mariana Islands. These attacks were {{to replace the}} largely unsuccessful Operation Matterhorn raids which had been conducted by XX Bomber Command aircraft based in India and staging through bases in China since June 1944. While XX Bomber Command conducted photo reconnaissance sorties over Japan {{as part of this}} effort, the aircraft flying from China lacked the range to reach Japan's main industrial centers. Without photographic intelligence XXI Bomber Command was unable to develop detailed plans for raids against its intended targets.|$|E

5|$|In late June 1942, the Allies {{decided to}} seize <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} Solomon Islands {{with the objective}} of denying their use by the Japanese to threaten the supply and communication routes between the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand. They also intended to use Guadalcanal and Tulagi as bases to support a campaign to eventually capture or neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain. Admiral Nimitz committed much of the Pacific Fleet to the task, including three of his four carrier task forces. They fell under the command of the recently appointed Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, commander of the South Pacific Area.|$|E
