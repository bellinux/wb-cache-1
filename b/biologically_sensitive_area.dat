Seafloor geology and benthic biological data were analyzed in conjunction with seafloor core sample geostatistical interpolation to locate suitable substrates for OCE anchoring.

40|$|Although tourism {{has been}} {{considered}} as an important activity {{for the well-being of}} the economies and state regulations on tourism have a considerable history in Turkey, the concept of sustainable tourism was first mentioned in the 8 th Five-Year Development Plan (2001 - 2005). Until that time however, almost all shores, forests, natural attractions and high plateaus were announced as tourism areas. In this regard, a productive and rationale use of the natural resources and even protection of ecologically and <b>biologically</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas</b> require a comprehensive determination of tourism policies and plans. The aim of the paper is to analyse state policies on sustainable tourism and discuss future plans and projects of the government in Turkey. Further, the study also aims to offer recommendations for policy makers in order to better manage the policies regarding sustainable tourism. ...|$|R

Existing submarine cable pathways were considered to determine pathways for power transmission cables that circumvent <b>biologically</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas.</b> Suitability analysis indicates that areas east of the Miami Terrace and north of recently identified deep-sea coral mounds are the most appropriate for OCE siting due to abundance of sand/sediment substrate, existing underwater cable route access, and minimal biological presence (i. e., little to no benthic communities). Further reconnaissance requires higher resolution maps of geological substrate and benthic community locations to identify specific OCE development locations, classify benthic conditions, and minimize potentially negative OCE environmental impacts...|$|R

40|$|As {{one of the}} {{fastest-growing}} cities in America, Tucson, Arizona suffers from a classic case of urban sprawl. Fueled by the prevalence of lot splits and cheap suburban land, little was done to curb the city's unsustainable growth until 1998, when the discovery of endangered pygmy owls in Tucson sparked the creation of the Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan. The plan aims to preserve biodiversity in Tucson and surrounding Pima County by limiting development in <b>biologically</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas</b> of the desert. In addition, Pima County is applying for a county-wide Section 10 Permit from US Fish & Wildlife Service. Water is another limiting factor in the city's growth. When Tucson overdrafted its groundwater resources, the city bought additional water from the Colorado River, which was channeled to Tucson through the Central Arizona Project. Due to infrastructure problems, initial delivery of canal water in 1992 was shut down in 1994. Tucson Water, the city's main water utility, later turned to recharge and recovery as a way to treat river water. Even with the addition of river water, Tucson, like other cities in the American Southwest, continues to search for new water sources for its ever-growing population. by Lisa Song. Thesis (S.

40|$|During {{the past}} 10 years, the {{evolution}} of marine spatial planning (MSP) and ocean zoning has become a crucial step in making ecosystem-based, sea use management a reality. The idea was initially stimulated by international and national interest in developing marine protected areas, e. g., the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. More recent attention {{has been placed on}} managing the multiple use of marine space, especially in areas where conflicts among users and the environment are already clear, e. g., in the North Sea. Even more recent concern has focused on the need to conserve nature, especially ecologically and <b>biologically</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas,</b> in the context of multi-use planning of ocean space. Despite academic discussions and the fact that some countries already have started implementation, the scope of MSP has not been clearly defined. Terms such as integrated management, marine spatial management, and ocean zoning are all used inconsistently. This {{is one of the reasons}} why its importance is not more seriously reflected at the levels of policy and decision-making in most countries. This article attempts to deal with this problem. It describes why MSP is an essential step to achieve ecosystem-based sea use management, how it can be defined and what its core objectives are. The article concludes with an analysis of the use and achievements of MSP worldwide, with particular focus on new approaches in Europe.

40|$|Increasingly, {{people are}} abandoning {{traditional}} vacation {{for a new}} type of tourism that gives them the sense of nature. Trekking in mountains, bird watching, archaeological digs, desert and photo safaris, scuba diving are some new types of vacations that attract tourists to travel to relatively remote and unspoiled areas. This type of travel is referred to as nature-based travel, ecotourism, or environmentally sustainable tourism. These terms are used interchangeably to reflect this trend in the travel industry. While many studies continuously attempt to differentiate between the terms used to reflect this type of travel, the general concern is to address the dialectic relationships between the natural and the man made, the visitors and tourists and the local population, and tradition and modernity. The generic concept of environmentally sustainable tourism has emerged in parallel to the realization of the potential benefits in combining people interest in nature with their concern for the environment. It is a responsible way of travel; an alternative to traditional travel, but it is not for everyone. It appeals to people who love nature and indigenous cultures. It allows those people to enjoy an attraction or a locality and ensures that local cultures and environments are unimpaired. As the environmentally sustainable tourism industry expands world-wide, well planned, ecologically sensitive facilities are in high demand that can be met with ecolodges: small scale facilities that provide tourists with the opportunity of being in close contact with nature and local culture. In response to this theme, research papers in this issue of Open House International attempt to answer the primary question: How much change in or alternations of natural and cultural environments will be acceptable? They explore sustainable planning and design for tourism by debating, analyzing, and visioning a wide spectrum of issues, with a focus on the developments taking place in <b>biologically</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas,</b> whether desert, forest, tropical coasts, or rural environments. Interestingly, they cover the planet Earth from Australia through the Arab World and Turkey to Argentina and Chile. An important shared aspect in these papers is that emphasis is placed upon integrating people, nature, and local economy into responsive development processes while offering lessons on how such integration may take place...|$|R

A theoretical model utilizing a 3 -dimensional finite element method (FEM) approach was established to extract the coupling-of-modes (COM) parameters in the absence and presence of mass loading covering the electrode structures. The COM model was used to simulate the frequency response of an R-SAW resonator by a P-matrix cascading technique. Cascading the P-matrixes of unloaded areas with mass loaded areas, the sensitivity for different <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas</b> was obtained by analyzing the frequency shift. The performance of the sensitivity analysis was confirmed by the measured responses from the silicon dioxide (SiO 2) deposited on different <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas</b> of R-SAW resonators.
