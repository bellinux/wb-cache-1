5|$|A September 1999 {{report from}} Baird's {{ministry}} showed that 10,600 workfare placements {{had been created}} {{in the first six}} months of 1999, a figure which the Toronto Star observed was significantly lower than that which had <b>been</b> <b>predicted</b> by the government.

5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is tilted only 5° from the ecliptic, the {{interior}} of this crater lies in perpetual darkness. Estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from Earth-based radar studies. Peaks along {{the rim of the}} crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight, spending about 80–90% of each lunar orbit exposed to the Sun. Continuously illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have <b>been</b> <b>predicted</b> to exist since the 1900s.|$|E
5|$|Rockwell workers mixed {{hazardous}} {{and other}} wastes with concrete to create one-ton solid blocks called pondcrete. These were {{stored in the}} open under tarps on asphalt pads. The pondcrete {{turned out to be}} weak storage, an outcome that had <b>been</b> <b>predicted</b> by Rockwell's own engineers. Relatively unprotected from the elements, the blocks began to leak and sag. Nitrates, cadmium and low-level radioactive waste began to leach into the ground and run downhill toward Walnut Creek and Woman Creek.|$|E

5|$|The use {{of weather}} charts {{in a modern}} sense began in the middle portion of the 19th century in order to devise a theory on storm systems.

5|$|While slight {{variations}} on the standard genetic code had <b>been</b> <b>predicted</b> earlier, none was discovered until 1979, when researchers studying human mitochondrial genes determined that they used an alternative code. However, the mitochondria of many other eukaryotes, including most plants, use the standard code. Many slight variants have been discovered since, including various alternative mitochondrial codes. Further, the AUA, AUC, and AUU codons are all allowable start codons.|$|E

Cu+Ne5 <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> {{to have a}} square pyramid shape. Cu+Ne6 has a seriously distroted octahedral shape. Cu+Ne12 has an icosahedral shape. Anything beyond that is less stable, with extra neon atoms having to make an extra shell of atoms around an icosahedral core.|$|R
5|$|Although all {{elements}} up to oganesson have been discovered, {{of the elements}} above hassium (element 108), only copernicium (element 112), nihonium (element 113), and flerovium (element 114) have known chemical properties, and only for the copernicium is there enough evidence for a conclusive categorisation at present. The other elements may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to relativistic effects; for example, flerovium has <b>been</b> <b>predicted</b> to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, {{even though it is}} currently placed in the carbon group. More recent experiments have suggested, however, that flerovium behaves chemically like lead, as expected from its periodic table position.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium is {{calculated}} to have several properties {{that differ from}} its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may even give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones. Copernicium has also been calculated to possibly show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all, although more recent calculations cast doubt on this possibility. It has also <b>been</b> <b>predicted</b> {{to be more difficult}} to oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the other group 12 elements.|$|E
5|$|Despite the UERL's {{success in}} {{financing}} and constructing the Hampstead Railway in only seven years, its opening {{was not the}} financial success that had been expected.

40|$|Predictions of alpha heating in L-mode and H-mode DT plasmas in ITER are {{generated}} using the PTRANSP code. The baseline toroidal field of 5. 3 T, plasma current ramped to 15 MA and a flat {{electron density profile}} ramped to Greenwald fraction 0. 85 are assumed. Various combinations of external heating by negative ion neutral beam injection, ion cyclotron resonance, and electron cyclotron resonance are assumed to start half-way up the density ramp. The time evolution of plasma temperatures and, for some cases, toroidal rotation <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> assuming GLF 23 and boundary parameters. Significant toroidal rotation and flow-shearing rates <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> by GLF 23 even in the L-mode phase with low boundary temperatures, and the alpha heating power <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> significant if the power threshold for the transition to H-mode {{is higher than the}} planned total heating power.
