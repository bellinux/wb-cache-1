After reaching maturity (7 - 9 months), MSG-treated rats and litter-matched untreated control rats were decapitated and brains dissected into brain regions. Opiate receptor assays were run with [3 H]morphine (mu receptor ligand) and [3 H]~-alanine 2 -~-leucine 5 (DADL) enkephalin (delta receptor ligand) for each brain region for both MSG and control rats simultaneously. Scatchard plot analyses showed a selective increase in delta receptors in the thala-mus only. No corresponding change in mu receptors in the thalamus was found. The cross-competition IC 5,, data supported this conclusion, showing a loss in the potency Injection of monosodium glutamate (MSG) dur-ing the neonatal period produces destruction of cell bodies in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (Olney, 1969). Dopamine and acetylcholine trans-ferase levels are reduced in the arcuate nucleus after MSG treatment (Lechan et al., 1977; Nemeroff et al., 1977). Since the cell bodies of the brain beta-endorphin (<b>B-END)</b> system, which also contains adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), are located within the arcuate nucleus (Watson et al., 1977; 1978 u, b), one might expect a decrease in <b>B-END</b> in MSG-treated animals. Immunocytochemical tech-niques demonstrate a loss of the cell bodies and de-generation of the fibers from the ACTH/B-END system in brain after MSG treatment (Bodnar et al., 1980).

40|$|The classic {{theory of}} {{mammalian}} brain and behavioral sexual differentiation holds that an organizational action of testosterone, secreted perinatally by the male’s testes, controls male-typical aspects of brain and behavioral development, whereas no active perinatal sex hormone signaling {{is required for}} female-typical differentiation. However, it has recently been shown using aromatase knock out (ArKO) mice, which are deprived of estradiol due to a targeted mutation in the aromatase gene, that estradiol may also actively contribute to the differentiation of female-typical aspects of behavior over a specific pre-pubertal period. Female ArKO mice showed significantly lower levels of lordosis behavior than wild type controls following adult ovariectomy and treatment with ovarian hormones. This deficit was restored by treating female ArKO mice with estradiol benzoate between postnatal days 15 and 25. However, the mechanism by which estradiol acts prepubertally in female mice to feminize lordosis behavior remains to be elucidated. Therefore, in a first attempt, we are determining which neuropeptides are in particularly sensitive to estradiol action over the prepubertal period. We will focus on neuropeptides which {{have been shown to}} be implicated in lordosis behavior. Studies by the group of Micevych have proposed an important role for NPY and beta-endorphin (<b>B-END)</b> neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) in the estradiol-mediated activation of lordosis behavior in female rats. An in vitro study recently showed that kisspeptin directly activates ARC <b>B-END</b> neurons. This is particularly interesting since unpublished results from our laboratory showed that Kp neurons are directly involved in the expression of lordosis behavior. We are thus currently determining the expression of NPY, <b>B-END,</b> and kisspeptin in the ARC as well as μ-opioid receptors MORs in the MPN over the prepubertal period and their possible modulation by prepubertal estradiol treatment...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies had}} shown the {{existence}} of an extra-arcuate cell group in lateral hypothalamus which contains alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (a-MSH) -like immunoreactivity, but no other pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) immunoreactivity. The question we have attempted to address in this series of studies is whether the material is indeed a-MSH or a cross-reacting material. Chromatographic studies failed to detect any material which is different from a-MSH or des-acetyl-a-MSH, suggesting that either the material is authentic a-MSH/des-acetyl-a-MSH, or that it is not detected by our RIAs. A series of manipulations including dissections of arcuate vs. extra-arcuate hypothalamic areas, treatment with colchicine, lesions with monosodium glutamate and knife cuts were aimed at isolating the extra-arcuate region and showing that it contains an excess of a-MSH over beta-endorphin (<b>B-END),</b> presumably deriving from the extra-arcuate group. However, all studies showed parallel changes in a-MSH and <b>B-END,</b> suggesting that we were not detecting a non-POMC derived a-MSH in these studies. This led to the tentative conclusion that the material was not a-MSH and was not being detected by our RIA's. This hypothesis was tested by further characterizing the material immunohistochemically. These studies led {{to the conclusion that the}} extra-arcuate material had a carboxy-terminal homology with a-MSH but differed from it in the midregion, since antisera directed at the 4 - 10 region of a-MSH failed to stain this non-POMC cell group.

Electrospray ionization MS indicates that narrow SEC fractions consist of different isomers, the number of which increases with molecular mass. Molecular mass moments and polydispersity numbers increase with polycondensation degree. The SANS measurements and SEC-DV data yield values for the polymers fractal dimension, which can be rationalized in the framework of percolation theory that originally was designed for randomly branched polymers.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether the Arp 2 / 3 complex activated by N-WASP (VCA) branches actin filaments at the side (side branching), or at the barbed (B-) end (end branching) of the mother filaments, we have directly observed the branching process of actin filaments and examined single-molecule unbinding under optical microscope. We found that side branching was predominant, though not exclusive. At the initial stage of polymerization, the branching at the <b>B-end</b> occurred and subsequently the side branching started to occur. In either type of branching, the mother and daughter filaments elongated at nearly the same rate (growing type). Inde-pendently of the stage of polymerization, branching due to the direct coupling of filaments with an acute angle to the mother fil-aments (a coupling type) occurred. Phalloidin suppressed the growing type of branching but not the coupling type, implying that actin monomers are required for the former but not the latter.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{investigate}} {{the involvement of}} the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the nuclear factor (NF) -�B pathway with diabetes-induced retinal inflammation. METHODS. Six weeks after induction of diabetes, C 57 BL/ 6 mice were treated with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT 1 -R) blocker (ARB) telmisartan or valsartan, the AT 2 -R blocker PD 123319, or the NF-�B inhibitor dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ) daily for 1 week. Retinal mRNA and protein levels of the RAS components were examined by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Leukocyte adhesion to the retinal vasculature was evaluated with a concanavalin A lectin perfusion-labeling technique. Retinal expression levels of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) - 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were examined by RT-PCR and ELISA. ARB or DHMEQ was applied to murine capillary endothelial (<b>b-End</b> 3) cells stimulated with a high concentration of glucose to analyze nuclear translocation of NF-�B via immunohistochemistry for p 65 and mRNA and protein levels of ICAM- 1 and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) - 1. RESULTS. Induction of diabetes led to a significant increase in retinal expression and production of the RAS components including angiotensin II, AT 1 -R, and AT 2 -R. Retinal adherent leukocytes were significantly suppressed by AT 1 -R, but not by AT 2 -R, blockade. Administration of the ARB, but not of PD 123319, inhibited diabetes-induced retinal expression of ICAM- 1 and VEGF.

40|$|The {{spontaneous}} emission spectrum for a three level cascade configuration atom {{in a single}} mode high-Q cavity coupled to a zero temperature reservoir of continuum external modes is determined from the atom-cavity mode master equation using the quantum regression theorem. Initially the atom is in its upper state and the cavity mode empty of photons. Following Glauber, the spectrum is defined via the response of a detector atom. Spectra are calculated for the detector located inside the cavity (case A), outside the cavity end mirror (Case <b>B-end</b> emission), or placed for emission out {{the side of the}} cavity (Case C). The spectra for case A and case B are found to be essentially the same. In all the cases the predicted lineshapes are free of instrumental effects and only due to cavity decay. Spectra are presented for intermediate and strong coupling regime situations (where both atomic transitions are resonant with the cavity frequency), for cases of non-zero cavity detuning, and for cases where the two atomic transition frequencies differ. The spectral features for Cases B(A) and C are qualitatively similar, with six spectral peaks for resonance cases and eight for detuned cases. These general features of the spectra can be understood via the dressed atom model. However, Case B and C spectra differ in detail, with the latter exhibiting a deep spectral hole at the cavity frequency due to quantum interference effects.
