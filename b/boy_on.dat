5|$|Brooks {{was born}} on 23 February 1876 at Draycott Moor near Faringdon, {{the son of a}} farm labourer. He grew up near Windsor, Berkshire, where his father {{afterwards}} worked in the Great Park, and as a child frequently encountered members of the Royal Family. After leaving school in 1890, he worked as a <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> the estates, where one of his duties was to look after a mule given to Queen Victoria by Lord Kitchener. In 1892 he enlisted in the 3rd Dragoon Guards, and after leaving the army joined the Glamorganshire Yeomanry as a volunteer.|$|E

Koprowski's prototype vaccine was given to an eight-year-old <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> 27 February 1950.

5|$|The {{meeting with}} Fleming led to Hawks's first {{job in the}} film industry, as a prop <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> the Douglas Fairbanks film In Again, Out Again (on which Fleming was {{employed}} as the cinematographer) for Famous Players-Lasky. According to Hawks, a new set needed to be built quickly when the studio's set designer was unavailable, so Hawks volunteered {{to do the job}} himself, much to Fairbanks's satisfaction. He was next employed as a prop boy and general assistant on an unspecified film directed by Cecil B. DeMille. (Hawks never named the film in later interviews and DeMille made five films roughly in that time period).|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{his career}} von Stroheim used {{grotesque}} imagery and characters. This is most {{apparent in the}} wedding-banquet scene, which includes a midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> crutches. The wedding guests violently and crudely devour their meal like animals. This scene was unlike any other in films of that period, which treated meals with dignity {{and a sense of}} communion. Other instances of grotesque imagery include Trina's fingers becoming infected and amputated. Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as the sewer with the dead rat and a garbage truck driving by as they kiss.|$|E
5|$|In Wonder Boy in Monster Land, players control Wonder Boy as he {{destroys the}} monsters in Monster Land and defeats the MEKA dragon. When the player begins the game, Wonder Boy starts {{out in the}} City of Wonder Land without any items or gold, but {{to give him a}} chance, at the {{beginning}} of the game, the city's mayor gives him a sword and a revival potion and sets him off on his own. The game is divided into twelve levels, and each of them has its own unique features, items, monsters, and secrets. These levels include towns, valleys, deserts, islands, and castles. Players use the D-pad to move Wonder <b>Boy</b> <b>on</b> the main screen, to enter doors by pressing upward, and to use Magic Weapons by pressing downward. The D-pad is also used to select between various items when in a shop. Players also have two buttons: one which makes Wonder Boy attack with his sword and buy items in the shop; and one which makes Wonder Boy jump and skip through storylines.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} October 2011 in Georgia, with filming occurring in Atlanta (including Inman Park) and several areas in Cobb County (including the Oakleigh, Echo Mill, and Amberton subdivisions {{in the city}} of Powder Springs). Filming also took place at Marietta Square {{in the city of}} Marietta, where businesses were renamed and an alley behind Hemingway's Bar & Grill was treated to artificially age the buildings. One of the Marietta scenes filmed involved a young <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> a skateboard being abducted by aliens. Scenes were also filmed in the Brookhaven community. On October 25, 2011, a casting call was made for extras to fill the football stadium during two nights of filming on November 2â€“3 at Campbell High School in Smyrna, Georgia. On November 23, 2011 a minor, walk-on role in the film was auctioned to benefit the Stiller Foundation; the role was sold for $23,000 to an undisclosed bidder.|$|E

5|$|Rainfall {{from the}} storm reached over 7inches (175mm) a short {{distance}} east of Pensacola, Florida, though impact in the state was minor. Wind gusts peaked at 38mph (61km/h) in Pensacola. In Alabama, Beryl produced sustained winds of 38mph (61km/h), with gusts to 54mph (86km/h), as well as above normal tides. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in coastal portions of Alabama, peaking at 16.09inches (408mm) on Dauphin Island. Rough waves overturned a shrimp boat in Mobile Bay. A 15-year-old <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> the boat drowned, the only direct fatality {{from the storm}}. The boy's father, also on the boat, spent 24hours in the water before being rescued by the United States Coast Guard. The waves caused severe beach erosion along the coastline, with Dauphin Island losing 60 to 70feet (18 to 21m) of beach.|$|E
5|$|The jurist Richard Posner saw Tripp as {{reviving}} psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's {{theory that}} masturbation helps to cause homosexuality by fixating a <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> the male genitals, {{based on evidence}} that homosexuals begin masturbating earlier than heterosexuals. Posner criticized the theory {{on the grounds that}} homosexuality and early masturbation could both be effects of whatever factor might be responsible for causing homosexuality. The geneticist Dean Hamer wrote that The Homosexual Matrix was influential and that Tripp provided the clearest articulation of the social learning theory of sexual orientation. However, Hamer found the theory itself implausible, and rejected it on numerous grounds, arguing that it is inconsistent with anthropological evidence and human evolutionary history, and fails to explain the existence of homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Very {{was born}} on August 28, 1813, in Salem, Massachusetts and {{spent much of his}} {{childhood}} at sea. He was the oldest of six children, born out of wedlock to two first cousins; his sister Lydia also became a writer. His mother, Lydia Very, was known for being an aggressive freethinker who made her atheistic beliefs known to all. She believed that marriage was only a moral arrangement and not a legal one. His father, also named Jones Very, was a captain during the War of 1812 and was held in Nova Scotia for a time by the British as a prisoner of war. When the younger Jones Very was ten, his father, by then a shipmaster, took him on a sailing voyage to Russia. A year later, his father had Very serve as a cabin <b>boy</b> <b>on</b> a trip to New Orleans, Louisiana. His father died on the return trip, apparently due to a lung disease he contracted while in Nova Scotia.|$|E
