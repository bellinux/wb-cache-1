A terpene-based material was the cleaning liquid used for the equipment evaluation. Equipment types that were evaluated includes low pressure inline sprayer, high pressure inline sprayer, spray under immersion cleaner, ultrasonic cleaners with different frequencies, centrifugal cleaners with and without immersion, and platform washer. Mild agitation was not sufficient to remove rosin _flux effectively from the exposed su@ace of printed circuit boards. In order to clean rosin trapped in small gaps (i. e., 4 mil) under the components, high pressure (> 75 psi) spraying, ultrasonic cleaning or high speed (> 1, 000 rpm) centrifugal cleaning is required...|$|E

The reliability of assemblies which have been cleaned with vapor degreasing and spray cleaning can be seriously compromised by residual contaminants leading to solder joint failure, board corrosion, and even electrical failure of the mounted parts. In addition, recent government actions to eliminate fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) and chlorinated hydrocarbons from the industrial environment require the development of new cleaning materials and techniques. This paper will discuss alternative cleaning materials and techniques and results that can be expected with them. Particular emphasis will be placed on problems related to surface-mounted parts. These new techniques may lead to improved circuit reliability and, at the same time, be less expensive and less environmentally hazardous than the traditional systems...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} root causes of the {{incidence}} of solder flux residue underneath electronic components in the manufacture of power modules. The existing deionized water-based centrifugal cleaning process was analyzed and hypotheses for root causes of the problem were proposed. The experimentation included cleaning tests using agitation and soak cycles. Parameters such as chemical agent, time and temperature were also tested for these tests. A novel method of residue incidence determination using visual inspection was proposed. Results suggest that the centrifugal process with water is incapable of providing enough agitation to effectively clean the residue. It was also found that product design and architectural causes greatly contribute to cleaning process effectiveness. It was concluded that effective printed circuit <b>board</b> <b>cleaning</b> requires high agitation and efficient product design. by Pranav Jain. Thesis (M. Eng.)

In this paper a demonstrator {{of a small}} and lightweight window-cleaning robot will be introduced.

The climbing mechanism has been realized by a certain number of passive suction cups, which are mounted on a special caterpillar system. This motion system enables a continuous forward movement that is important for the cleaning result of the window. The combination of the caterpillar kinematics with passive suction cups represents a new and patented development that enables a low energy consumption.

One solution could be to make better use of the parties at an airport. Ground handling parties are an example of parties at an airport. Aircraft fueling, passenger <b>boarding</b> and <b>cleaning</b> of an aircraft are examples of ground handling processes, which are performed by ground handling parties. This thesis focuses on replanning of ground handling processes. The original ground handling process plan is modeled as a Simple Temporal Problem. By solving the Temporal Decoupling Problem for a given plan, the plan is split into several independent subplans, each subplan represents {{a plan for a}} service provider. Whenever an aircraft is delayed or one of the ground handling processes is disturbed, the current plan may become infeasible. Subsequently, repair algorithms have to be applied to repair the broken plan. The main contribution of this thesis is to propose repair algorithms for a ground handling process plan, modeled as a decoupled Simple Temporal Problem.

40|$|Though MIG welding robots are {{extensively}} {{applied in}} the automotive assemblies ‘Spot Welding’ {{is the most common}} welding application found in the auto stamping assembly manufacturing. Every manufacturing process is subject to variations – with resistance welding, these include; part fit up, part thickness variations, misaligned electrodes, variations in coating materials or thickness, sealers, weld force variations, shunting, machine tooling degradation; and slag and spatter damage. All welding gun tips undergo wear; an elemental part of the process. Though adaptive resistance welding control automatically compensates to keep production and quality up to the levels needed as gun tips undergo wear so that the welds remain reliable; the system cannot compensate for deterioration caused by the slag and spatter on the part holding fixtures, sensors, and gun tips. To cleanse welding robots of slag and spatter, dry-ice blasting has proven to be an effective remedy. Presently, CO 2 / dry ice blasting is being effectively used in a wide array of applications from heavy slag removal to delicate semiconductor and circuit <b>board</b> <b>cleaning.</b> This process can be used on-line without damaging equipment or requiring a machine "teardown". Unlike conventional toxic chemicals, high-pressure water blasting and abrasive grit blasting, CO 2 / dry ice blasting uses dry ice particles in a high velocity air flow to remove contaminates from surfaces without the added costs and inconvenience of secondary waste treatment and disposal. This paper describes MIG and Spot welding process and analyses the slag and spatter formation during robotic welding of stamping assemblies; and concludes that the dry ice blasting process’s utility in cleansing of welding robots in auto stamping plant operations is paramount and exigen...|$|E
40|$|Control and {{comparison}} of various cleaning methods on restaurants in Södra Roslagen The {{purpose of this}} report {{is to find out}} and analyze the efficiency of cleaning methods in restaurant kitchens. The investigation was carried out through unannounced inspections at 89 restaurants in Södra Roslagen (municipality of Danderyd, Täby and Vaxholm). ATP-measuring was done on a plate, a knife, a bench surface and a cutting board. The ATP-method measured the amount of food residue on equipment and working surfaces after cleaning, with a luminometer and swabs. Restaurant staffs were asked to describe in detail how and when the last cleaning was carried out on the surface. The results after cleaning were not as good as one would expect. Of the 342 tests that were analyzed only 42 % passed, 10 % got caution and 48 % of the tests failed. It seems most difficult to clean the cutting <b>boards</b> sufficiently. <b>Cleaning</b> in a dishwasher gave generally better result than washing by hand. Plain detergent and to rinse with water seem to give the best results for bench surface. Many food businesses in Södra Roslagen and other communities had insufficient procedures for cleaning and need to improve the methods.

40|$|In 2002, a sharp {{increase}} in outbreaks of norovirus-associated illness, both on cruise ships and on land, encouraged us to examine the molecular epidemiology of detected noroviruses, to identify a common strain or source. Of 14 laboratory-confirmed outbreaks on cruise ships, 12 (86 %) were attributed to caliciviruses; among these 12, outbreak characteristics included continuation on successive cruises in 6 (50 %), multiple modes of transmission in 7 (58 %), and high (110 %) attack rates in 7 (58 %). Eleven of the 12 calicivirus outbreaks were attributed to noroviruses, 7 (64 %) of which were attributed to a previously unreported lineage, provisionally named “the Farmington Hills strain. ” From May 2002 to December 2002, 10 (45 %) of 22 land-based outbreaks also were attributed to this strain. Nucleotide-sequence analysis provided insights into norovirus transmission, by docu-menting links among outbreaks, the introduction of strains onto ships, and viral persistence on <b>board</b> (despite <b>cleaning).</b> Control measures for outbreaks should address all routes of transmission. Better outbreak surveillance and collection of data on sequences will help to monitor norovirus strains and to identify common sources. Noroviruses, formerly referred to as “Norwalk-like vi-ruses, ” are the most common etiologic agents of acute gastroenteritis in the United States, where they are es-timated to cause 23 million cases annually [1].

40|$|Wire bonding is {{a widely}} used {{interconnection}} technology in electronic packaging. Due to the advantages of fast bonding process, high productivity, good electrical and thermal performance, Au wire bonding has been widely applied to various electronic packaging applications, such as Multi chip module (MCM), B all grid array (BGA) and Chip-on-board (COB). The organic substrates for Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) have a low glass transitional temperature, Tg, typically 130 °C. This imposes limitations on the wire bonding process because wire bonding must be performed at temperatures far below the Tgof the substrate to avoid softening of the materials. Meanwhile, a substrate with a high Tg incurs additional cost arising from material and fabrication processes. The objective of this thesis is to optimize metallization and process variables to enhance wire bondability and product yields of low temperature Au wedge thermosonic bonding. The wire bond strength with various metallization characteristics were correlated to establish the process window for successful low temperature wire bonding. The technological understanding acquired in this thesis {{can be used as}} a practical guideline for PCB metallization plating and processing conditions. The research was carried out in four stages. The first stage examined the surface characteristics of various metallization schemes on conventional FR- 4 PCBs. The second stage investigated the interrelation between the metallization characteristics and the wire bonding process variables. The third stage studied the improvement in wire bonding by plasma cleaning. The last stage was a study of high temperature wire bonding on Bismaleimide triazine (BT) substrate. Based on the bond tests and process windows established, optimizing bonding parameters for acceptable wire bond strengths at low temperatures were identified. Specific recommendations were made on the optimum surface and elemental characteristics of metallization that can improve wire bondability.

Plastic cutting boards used in the foodservice/commercial food preparation kitchen setting would be ideal surfaces for a biofilm to form. The purpose of this experiment {{was to determine if}} biofilms were capable of forming on cutting boards that were used in a foodservice/commercial food preparation kitchen. Three 25 cm 2 surface areas were randomly selected on 15 plastic cutting boards (n = 45) from a food preparation kitchen to be swabbed before and after proper cleaning and sanitizing. Swabs were diluted in buffered peptone water, serial dilutions made on Plate Count Agar and incubated for 48 hours at 37 °C. The average aerobic plate count for the plastic cutting boards before sanitation was 1. 31 x 10 E 4 + 2. 00 x 10 E 4 CFU/ 25 cm 2. After sanitation of the plastic cutting boards, the average aerobic plate count was 1. 35 x 10 E 3 + 1. 91 x 10 E 3 CFU/ 25 cm 2. The results indicate that plastic cutting <b>boards,</b> even after <b>cleaning</b> and sanitizing, can support biofilms when they are heavily scarred and discolored...|$|R

Mutual interdependencies between airports result in system-wide, far-reaching effects in the air traffic network (reactionary delays). To comply with airline/airport challenges over the day of operations, a change to an air-to-air perspective is necessary, with a specific focus on the aircraft ground operations as major driver for airline punctuality.

40|$|Future 4 D {{aircraft}} trajectories {{demand the}} comprehensive consideration of environmental, economic, and operational constraints. A reliable prediction of all aircraft-related processes along the specific trajectories {{is essential for}} punctual operations. The uncertainties in the airborne phase only have minor impacts on the punctuality of a flight. The necessary change to an air-to-air perspective, with a specific focus on the ground operations, will provide key elements for complying with the challenging future requirements of a comprehensive 4 D aircraft trajectory over the day of operations. A major task of the ground operations is to ensure a reliable and predictable departure time, which is an operational milestone for both the current and the destination airport. These mutual interdependencies between airports result in system-wide, far-reaching effects (reactionary delays). The ground trajectory of an aircraft primarily consists of the handling processes at the stand (deboarding, catering, fueling, <b>cleaning,</b> <b>boarding,</b> unloading, and loading), which are defined as the aircraft turnaround. To provide a reliable prediction of the turnaround, the critical path of processes has to be managed in a sustainable manner. The turnaround processes are mainly controlled by the ground handling, airport or airline staff, except the aircraft boarding, which {{is driven by the}} passengers’ experience and willingness or ability to follow the proposed procedures. Addressing the fact that boarding is on the critical path of the aircraft 4 D trajectory and not controlled by the operators, this paper provides a scientific approach for a real-time evaluation of the boarding progress using the capabilities of a future connected cabin (e. g. sensor environment). A calibrated microscopic approach is used to model the distinct passenger behavior, where the individual movement is defined as a one-dimensional, stochastic, and time/space discrete transition process. The simulation environment is capable of covering a broad range of behaviors, boarding strategies and operational constraints and allows the integration of infrastructural changes and future technologies. The paper provides a set of indicators for depicting the real-time status of the boarding progress as a fundamental basis for the prediction of the boarding time. In this context, the aircraft seats are used as a sensor network with the capability to detect the seat status: free or occupied. The seat status is the basis for the calculation of an aircraft-wide interference potential as the major indicator for the boarding time. In combination with an integrated airline/airport information management (e. g. sequence of boarding passengers), the boarding progress will be transformed from a black box to a transparent progress with the operator’s real-time ability to react to significant deviations from the planned progress. Thus, the research results provide a fundamental contribution towards the derivation of the crucial aircraft departure time...|$|R
