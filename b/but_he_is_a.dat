5|$|Ganesha likely {{emerged as}} a deity {{as early as the}} 2nd century AD, but most {{certainly}} by the 4th and 5th centuries AD, during the Gupta period, although he inherited traits from Vedic and pre-Vedic precursors. Hindu mythology identifies him as the restored son of Parvati and Shiva of the Shaivism tradition, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> pan-Hindu god found in its various traditions. In the Ganapatya tradition of Hinduism, Ganesha is the supreme deity. The principal texts on Ganesha include the Ganesha Purana, the Mudgala Purana, and the Ganapati Atharvashirsa. Brahma Purana and Brahmanda Purana are other two Puranic genre encyclopedic texts that deal with Ganesha.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} 1998 {{annual meeting of}} the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, held in Utah, United States, rumors were {{circulating}} about a striking fossil of a primitive bird that was in private hands. This fossil was presented by an anonymous dealer at a gem show in Tucson, Arizona. The Dinosaur Museum in Blanding, Utah, purchased it in February 1999. The museum is run by Stephen A. Czerkas and his wife, Sylvia Czerkas. Mr. Czerkas does not hold a university degree, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> dinosaur enthusiast and artist. He arranged for patrons of his museum, including trustee Dale Slade, to provide $80,000 for the purchase of the fossil, in order to study it scientifically and prevent it from disappearing into an anonymous private collection.|$|E

25|$|Although he {{was billed}} as such at various times, Arn {{is not related to}} Gene Anderson, Lars Anderson, Ole Anderson, C.W. Anderson or Ric Flair. He was given the Anderson name and was {{originally}} billed as Ole's brother, and then later billed as Ole's nephew, because of his resemblance to Ole in appearance and wrestling style and billed as Ric Flair's cousin. Flair is not related to any of the Andersons, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> longtime friend of Arn.|$|E
25|$|The ADQ MNAs and {{supporters}} met in Victoriaville in late September 2007 to detail the party's environmental policy. Former PQ Cabinet Member Jean Garon, former Hydro-Québec CEO André Caillé and environmental activist Steven Guilbeault attended the convention. Tom Pentefountas, a former ADQ {{candidate in the}} district of Nelligan in a 2004 by-election, succeeded Gilles Taillon as President of the party. Pentefountas enjoys little name recognition among voters in general, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> member of the Greek community and lives in Montreal. ADQ supporters hope that his profile might facilitate the party's attempts to connect with these constituencies.|$|E

Ironically, that version of Rebus is played by a Hearts supporter, Ken Stott. DS Siobhan Clarke, his colleague in the later books, is a [...] "loyal supporter" [...] of Hibs.|$|E
500|$|On June 7, 2008, Franken was {{endorsed}} by the DFL. In a July 2008 interview with CNN, he was {{endorsed by}} Ben Stein, a noted entertainer, speechwriter, lawyer and author known for his conservative views, who generally supported Republican candidates. Stein said of Franken, [...] "He is my pal, {{and he is a}} really, really capable smart guy. I don't agree with all of his positions, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very impressive guy, and I think he should be in the Senate." ...|$|E
500|$|Makar Alekseyevich Devushkin (Макар Алексеевич Девушкин) [...] {{the protagonist}} of Poor Folk is a shy, poor and lonely forty-seven-year-old clerk and copyist. He has been {{compared}} to other clerks from the [...] "natural school" [...] such as [...] "The Overcoat"'s Akaky Akakievich. Although trying to use literature to understand life, Devushkin does not discuss these topics separately, and falsely believes that Dobroselova's letters reflect his life, taking short stories as realistic works. He exhibits typical sentimental characteristics; according to Robert Payne, Dostoyevsky [...] "writes on the edge of sentimentality, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> completely credible and rounded figure". Devushkin's name derives from devushka, meaning maiden or girl, possibly symbolizing virginity and innocence, although Joseph Frank remarked it is an incongruent description.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{for the character}} from both professionals and fans has been positive. In his DVD review for DVD Verdict, Bill Treadway called Patrick [...] "the village idiot, who sometimes gives SpongeBob some really bad advice, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> loyal friend and that's something we don't see much of these days." [...] He said, [...] "Patrick {{is the definition of}} stupid and his antics will have you laughing out loud." [...] In a review published in 2007, Peter Keepnews of The New York Times said, [...] "Patrick is a popular character, and the new episodes illustrate why: He is unfailingly enthusiastic, touchingly loyal and absolutely undeterred by his intellectual limitations. Hilariously voiced by Bill Fagerbakke, he is not just an endearing comic creation but a role model for idiots everywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|According to New Zealand {{music critic}} Graham Reid, a {{contemporary}} Australian review remarked on the album's religiosity: [...] "oftentimes {{the music is}} a more truthful guide {{to the sense of}} the lyrics than the words themselves. Harrison is not a great wordsmith <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> superb musician. Everything flows, everything interweaves. His melodies are so superb they take care of everything …" [...] Like Holden, Nicholas Schaffner approved of the singer's gesture in donating his publishing royalties to the Material World Charitable Foundation and praised the album's [...] "exquisite musical underpinnings". Although the [...] "transcendent dogma" [...] was not always to his taste, Schaffner recognised that in Living in the Material World, Harrison had [...] "devised a luxuriant rock devotional designed to transform his fans' stereo equipment into a temple".|$|E
500|$|James {{earned his}} first NBA All-Star Game {{selection}} in 2004–05, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference. Around the league, teams {{took note of}} his rapid development, with Denver Nuggets coach George Karl telling Sports Illustrated, [...] "It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule." [...] On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record. With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team. Despite a 30–20 record to start the year, the Cavaliers again {{failed to make the}} playoffs, finishing the season 42–40.|$|E

500|$|During 1923, after {{returning}} to England, Gilligan had his best season in county cricket. He took 163 wickets at 17.50 and scored 1,183 runs {{at an average of}} 21.12 to complete the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in a season for the only time in his career. With Maurice Tate, whose emergence as a pace bowler was encouraged by Gilligan, he established a bowling partnership which proved effective over the following two seasons. Gilligan scored two centuries and nine times took five or more wickets in an innings. As a result of his performances, he was named as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. The citation noted that he was now [...] "among the leading amateur cricketers of the day", and was likely to play for England again. It concluded: [...] "It is not claimed for Arthur Gilligan, by even his warmest admirers, that he can be classed among great fast bowlers, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very good one, combining with the right temperament and tireless energy just the extra bit of pace that to many batsmen is so distasteful." ...|$|E
500|$|Aadisht Khanna from Mint praised Tripathi's {{portrayal}} of Shiva in the book, complimenting {{the fact that}} he was able to successfully deliver the humane side of his characters, and their emotions and motivations. He also pointed out that Tripathi's experimentation with Indian Scriptures, has been successful in transforming an otherwise mundane genre, [...] "long overdue in popular literature, especially by an Indian author". However, he was disappointed in the weak dialogue and the grammatical errors scattered throughout the book, especially the inclusion of [...] "glaringly out-of-place world" [...] words, thus having too many anachronism in the book. Rito Paul from Daily News and Analysis shared Khanna's opinion, while saying that the book [...] "is impressive in its conception. But it is executed poorly. [...] "We're thrust into the narrative, mid-action, exactly from where the first book ended. And the breathless pace of the action hardly ever lets up... There are more twists and turns than in a Gordian knot, and at least two revelations of the 'Luke-I-am-your-father' variety... And it really rankles, because there is so much scope for flair, adventure and wonder in the world Tripathi has imagined... The Secrets is not a bad book. The plot holds your attention and the story races along, but the writing veers between the pedestrian and the ridiculous. Tripathi is an excellent story-teller. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> poor writer." ...|$|E
500|$|Webb {{stated that}} he and the crew wanted to keep the stunts more {{grounded}} physically, a challenge for a superhuman character. The stunt performers included the Armstrong family, Vic and Andy, along with Richard Norton who plays a SWAT team member. Andy Armstrong was the stunt coordinator while Vic was the second unit director. To determine how Spider-Man should swing, Andy videotaped an Olympic Games gymnast swinging on a horizontal bar. Andy noted that in the computer-generated swing in the earlier Spider-Man films, [...] "he swings down at the same speed as he swings up," [...] and this [...] "constant" [...] speed is unlike a real gymnast's movement where [...] "he's accelerating until he reaches the bottom, then as he starts to come up, he's decelerating until he gets to the top of his swing and he actually gets negative gravity, where he'll go weightless for a second, and then the next swing starts, and it becomes another violent swing again." [...] Vic felt that Spider-Man's moves were comparable to those of Tarzan, and he wanted to add that in the film. While filming in New York City, they swung a man through traffic down the street. Then, while the crew built a rig hundreds of feet long over Riverside Drive in Harlem, Andy built a car rig with a series of wires to help with effects which Webb said required an [...] "incredible wealth of acrobatics". These rigs were over 200–300 feet long and demanded months of rehearsals and design. According to Andy, operating the rigs [...] "was a combination of a lot of human skills and mechanical engineering." [...] The purpose of the rigs was to depict Spider-Man's swing in a way that wasn't computer-generated. Garfield was reported to be involved with some of the stunts. Leaked pictures reveal Garfield with a nosebleed that reports claimed was from swinging. Arad explained that [...] "Andrew is not only a brilliant actor <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sportsman. This gave us the opportunity to try things with him that were it not so it would have been almost impossible." ...|$|E

2500|$|Richards' {{amplifier}} preferences {{have changed}} repeatedly, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> long-time proponent of using low-powered amps in the studio, getting clarity plus distortion by using two amps, a larger one {{such as a}} Fender Twin run clean, along with a Fender Champ, which is overdriven. To record Crosseyed Heart, Richards used a stock tweed Fender Champ with 8" [...] speaker coupled with a modified Fender Harvard.|$|E
