40|$|Background: The {{study of}} {{traditional}} knowledge of medicinal plants {{has led to}} discoveries that have helped combat diseases and improve healthcare. However, the development of quantitative measures that can assist our quest for new medicinal plants has not greatly advanced in recent years. Phylogenetic tools have entered many scientific fields {{in the last two decades}} to provide explanatory power, but have been overlooked in ethnomedicinal studies. Several studies show that medicinal properties are not randomly distributed in plant phylogenies, suggesting that phylogeny shapes ethnobotanical use. Nevertheless, empirical studies that explicitly combine ethnobotanical and phylogenetic information are scarce. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we borrowed tools from community ecology phylogenetics to quantify significance of phylogenetic signal in medicinal properties in plants and identify nodes on phylogenies with high <b>bioscreening</b> potential. To do this, we produced an ethnomedicinal review from extensive literature research and a multilocus phylogenetic hypothesis for the pantropical genus Pterocarpus (Leguminosae: Papilionoideae). We demonstrate that species used to treat a certain conditions, such as malaria, are significantly phylogenetically clumped and we highlight nodes in the phylogeny that are significantly overabundant in species used to treat certain conditions. These cross-cultural patterns in ethnomedicinal usage in Pterocarpus are interpreted in the light of phylogenetic relationships. Conclusions/Significance: This study provides techniques that enable the application of phylogenies in <b>bioscreening,</b> bu...|$|E

Because protein-protein {{interactions}} underpin most biological processes, developing tools that target them to understand their function or to inform the development of therapeutics, is an important task. SUMOylation is the posttranslational covalent attachment of proteins in the SUMO family (SUMO 1, SUMO 2, or SUMO 3) and regulates numerous cellular pathways. SUMOylated proteins are recognized by proteins with SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs) that facilitate non-covalent interactions with SUMO. Here, we describe the use of the Affimer system of peptide display for rapid isolation of synthetic binding proteins that inhibit SUMO-dependent protein-protein interactions mediated by SIMs both in vitro and in cells. Crucially, these synthetic proteins did not prevent SUMO conjugation either in vitro or in cell-based systems, enabling the specific analysis of SUMO-mediated protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, through structural analysis and molecular modelling, we explored the molecular mechanisms that may underlie their specificity in interfering with either SUMO 1 -mediated interactions or interactions mediated by either SUMO 2 or SUMO 3. Not only will these reagents enable investigation of the biological roles of SUMOylation, the Affimer technology used to generate these synthetic binding proteins could be exploited to design or validate reagents or therapeutics that target other protein-protein interactions.

40|$|Ethnopharmacological {{relevance}} One of {{the major}} drawbacks of using ethnomedicinal data to direct testing of plants which may find pharmaceutical use is that certain plants without bioactivity might be traditionally used. An accepted way of highlighting bioactive plants is to compare usage in different cultures. This approach infers that presumed independent discovery by different cultures provides evidence for bioactivity. Although several studies have made cross-cultural comparisons, they focussed on closely related cultures, where common patterns might {{be the result of}} common cultural traditions. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare three independent ethnomedicinal floras for which similarities can be more robustly interpreted as independent discoveries, and therefore likely to be indication for efficacy. Materials and methods Data from the literature were compiled about the ethnomedicinal floras for three groups of cultures (Nepal, New Zealand and the Cape of South Africa), selected to minimise historical cultural exchange. Ethnomedicinal applications were divided in 13 categories of use. Regression and binomial analyses were performed at the family level to highlight ethnomedicinal “hot” families. General and condition-specific analyses were carried out. Results from the three regions were compared. Results Several “hot” families (Anacardiaceae, Asteraceae, Convolvulaceae, Clusiaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Geraniaceae, Lamiaceae, Malvaceae, Rubiaceae, Sapindaceae, Sapotaceae and Solanaceae) were recovered in common in the general analyses. Several families were also found in common under different categories of use. Conclusions Although profound differences are found in the three ethnomedicinal floras, common patterns in ethnomedicinal usage are observed in widely disparate areas of the world with substantially different cultural traditions. As these similarities are likely to stem from independent discoveries, they strongly suggest that underlying bioactivity might be the reason for this convergent usage. The global distribution of prominent usage of families used in common obtained by this study and the wider literature is strong evidence that these families display exceptional potential for discovery of previously overlooked or new medicinal plants and should be placed in high priority in <b>bioscreening</b> studies and conservation schemes. ...|$|E

In Fiji, some parts of the digestive gland of the animals are initially removed before it is cooked and eaten. Egg masses on the other hand, are eaten raw after marinating with lemon. Several biologically active metabolites have been isolated from Dolabella auricularia, including the highly toxic and biologically active dolastatin family of cylic peptides. The current preliminary study evaluates the toxicity level of the secondary metabolites present in the local animals and investigates the anatomical distribution of biologically active compounds particularly in its digestive glands and the exterior, which includes the skin and mantle. Three extracts of Dolabella auricularia were subjected to a <b>bioscreening</b> study to detect cytotoxic activity by the brine shrimp lethality bioassay. The extracts studied were: (1) metabolites from the digestive glands (internal organs), (2) metabolites from the whole organism, and (3) metabolites from the skin and mantle (external organs) of the animal. Extracts (1), (2) and (3) were shown to be toxic to brine shrimps with lethality levels found at < 100 ppm, 480 ppm and 2000 ppm respectively. Although further works needs to be completed, our preliminary results show that the metabolites extracted from the digestive organs were significantly more toxic than those obtained from the skin and mantle of the animal. This result is not surprising as many researchers have shown that sea hares are a rich source of bioactive substances believed to be of dietary origin. In Fiji, where this sea hare is sold at the local market, the high lethality levels found for the digestive glands suggest that it is crucial that the digestive gland of the animal be removed before the animal is consumed.

However, fermentation of lignocellulosic materials presents some challenges, one of them being the toxicity of the substrate for the fermenting organism. Toxic effects of lignocellulosic raw material inhibitors and their effect on the metabolism and viability of the fermenting organism is a major research subject. The work presented in this report aimed at developing a superior method for {{the determination of the}} fraction of viable cells in a yeast population. The method is based on growth curve determinations performed with the <b>Bioscreen</b> C MBR instrument. This equipment is a tool for microbiology optimized for growth analyzes (<b>Bioscreen,</b> 2011). Experiments carried out with <b>Bioscreen</b> allowed developing a method to perform optimal growth curves in this equipment after some experimental parameters were optimized.

The products of glucose-fuelled and endogenous metabolism were identified by (1) H NMR and (13) C NMR as ethanol, acetate, alanine and lactate. Mass spectrometric monitoring of gas metabolism in buffered cell suspensions showed that glucose and ethanol could be used by S. vortens as energy-generating substrates, but <b>bioscreen</b> automated monitoring of growth in culture medium, as well as NMR analyses, suggested that neither of these compounds are the substrates of choice for this organism.

40|$|With {{increasing}} energy demand, decreasing oil supply, and continuously accumulating {{waste in}} landfills, {{the interest in}} converting lignocellulosic biomass to liquid fuels has grown. The MixAlco? process requires no exogenous enzymes, no sterility, {{can be adapted to}} any biodegradable feedstock, and converts lignocellulosic biomass into valuable chemicals and transportation fuels. This work focuses on the effects different feedstocks and inocula have on mixed-acid/hydrogen fermentations. When volatile solids (VS) are digested, mixed-acid fermentations produce hydrogen gas as a secondary byproduct. Hydrogen is only produced when there is an excess of NADH within the cell and when the energy selectivity (gamma) of the system has not been met. Continuous fermentations of paper produced 16. 7 g carboxylic acid/L and 15. 7 mL H 2 /g VS digested. Continuous fermentations of pretreated bagasse produced 17. 1 g carboxylic acid/L and 41. 1 mL H 2 /g VS digested. Both fermentations produced a fraction of the theoretical amount of hydrogen. The paper fermentation had a hydrogen percent yield of 6. 9 percent, whereas the bagasse fermentation had a hydrogen percent yield of 22. 6 percent. Hydrogen production was capped at this level because gamma had been met for these systems. The <b>Bioscreening</b> Project, a joint project between three departments, sought to improve the MixAlco? process by finding natural cultures containing high biomass converters and high acid producers. A total of 505 inoculum samples were collected from 19 sites and screened using paper and yeast extract fermentations. The best converters were analyzed with Continuum Particle Distribution Modeling (CPDM). Nine inocula were run in paper and yeast extract countercurrent fermentations in which the overall performance varied less than 13 percent. Comparisons between six countercurrent train cultures showed an average culture similarity of 0. 40 (Yue-Clayton similarity). With the dissimilar microbial cultures and the very similar fermentation performance, the performance of the MixAlco? process depends on fermentation conditions, not on the microorganisms. Batch fermentations of office paper wastes, pineapple residue, Aloe vera rinds, wood molasses, sugar molasses, extracted algae, non-extracted algae, crude glycerol, obtained from the biodiesel process, and pretreated water hyacinths produced sufficient carboxylic acids and had sufficiently high conversions to be viable substrates for the MixAlco? process...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 15 - 20 years, {{there has been}} growing {{interest}} and concern from the scientific and regulatory communities over the potential risks of emerging environmental contaminants (ECs). State-of-the-art techniques used for monitoring ECs do not provide the high spatial and temporal resolution measurements required to better understand and mitigate the risks. Immunoassays, which use antibodies to detect a target compound with high affinity, specificity and selectivity, partly address these limitations. However, the use of antibodies {{for the detection of}} small-sized, non-immunogenic environmental contaminants, presents a number of challenges. Recent advances in protein engineering have led to the emergence of antibody mimetics that offer the high affinity and specificity associated with antibodies, but with reduced batch-to-batch variability, increased stability, and in vitro selection to ensure rapid discovery of binders against a wide range of targets. This study explores the potential of Affimers, a recent example of antibody mimetics, as suitable bioreceptors for the detection of small organic molecules. Methylene blue (MB), a redox-active molecule used as a fabric dye and diclofenac (DCF), an important environmental contaminant, were selected as the target compounds and Affimers against MB and DCF were developed by the <b>BioScreening</b> Technology Group, University of Leeds. The objectives of this project were to a) demonstrate that the developed Affimers can bind to the selected targets with very high affinity, b) assess their performance in the complexity of environmental water samples (selectivity), and c) investigate the potential of an Affimer-based assay for small molecule detection. Target immobilisation for Affimer characterisation was achieved using long-chained alkanethiol linkers coupled with oligoethylene glycol (LCAT–OEG) and the immobilisation approach was evaluated through electrochemical measurements and infrared spectroscopy. Subsequently, binding between the immobilised targets and target-specific Affimers was quantified using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). Affimer affinity studies revealed Affimer dissociation constants (KD= 13. 7 nM and 73 nm for MB and DCF Affimers respectively) was comparable to that of high affinity antibodies. Furthermore, the high selectivity of MB-Affimers was demonstrated using limnetic water samples. Finally, an Affimer-based competition ELISA was demonstrated (LOD= 75 nM), illustrating the potential of Affimers as bioreceptors in immunoassays for the detection of small-sized, non-immunogenic compounds. These findings are very promising, encouraging further research into Affimer-based assays and biosensors in order to introduce a novel, alternative path for rapid, on-site monitoring of contaminants in the environment. ...|$|E
40|$|In a {{first part}} of my work, {{preliminary}} to all the successive investigations, novel thymidine- or uridine-based nucleolipids, containing one hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) chain {{and one or two}} oleic acid residues (called ToThy, HoThy, DoHu and ToThyChol), have been synthesized with the aim to develop biocompatible nanocarriers for drug delivery and/or produce pro-drugs. Studies of microstructural characterization of the corresponding aggregates have been carried out in pure water and in pseudo-physiological conditions through DLS and SANS experiments. For ToThy, HoThy and DoHu stable vesicles, with mean hydrodynamic radii ranging between 120 nm and 250 nm have been revealed. In the case of ToThyChol, stable micelles were observed under the same experimental conditions, with mean hydrodynamic radii of 100 nm. Biological validation of the nucleolipidic nanocarriers was ensured by evaluation of their toxicological profiles, performed by administration of the nanoaggregates to a panel of different cell lines. ToThy exhibited a weak cytotoxicity and, at high concentration, some ability to interfere with cell viability and/or proliferation. In contrast, DoHu, HoThy and ToThyChol exhibited no toxicological relevance, behaving similarly to POPC-based liposomes, widely used for systemic drug delivery. Taken together, these results show that the here synthesized nucleolipid-based nanocarriers are finely tunable, self-assembling materials, potentially suitable for the in vivo transport of biomolecules or drugs. In a successive study, these nucleosidic nanovectors have been exploited as multifunctional ligands to obtain the corresponding ruthenium(III) salts, of interest as potential anticancer drugs. The obtained amphiphilic nucleosidic complexes were then studied in their self-aggregation properties by DLS and SANS techniques in aqueous solutions and in pseudo-physiological conditions. In analogy with the behaviour reported in the literature for the known Ru(III) complexes, the studied complexes ToThyRu, HoThyRu, DoHuRu and ToThyCholRu showed a limited stability in aqueous solutions, producing in few hours green precipitates. Therefore we studied how to achieve the complete stabilization in physiological media of these compounds. This goal was accomplished by use of the nucleosidic Ru(III) complexes in formulation with POPC in molar ratio 15 : 85. Under these conditions, the complexes were completely stable in pseudo-physiological solutions for several weeks. A complete and comprehensive study on the in vitro bioactivity was performed on the synthesized complexes in POPC formulation, particularly examining their growth inhibition ability on MCF- 7 and WiDr cell lines. Most remarkably, very promising results were observed on ToThyRu/POPC and HoThyRu/POPC formulations, showing IC 50 values of 9 and 15 M, respectively, on MCF- 7 cell lines. In vitro <b>bioscreening</b> studies on other cancer cell lines are currently in progress, with the peculiar aim to evaluate specificity effects. To investigate the in vivo mechanism of action of the synthesized compounds, a novel amphiphilic nucleosidic Ru(III) -complex, bearing the fluorescent dansyl group, was designed and synthesized, essentially built around the same basic skeleton present in HoThyRu, for applications in fluorescence microscopy. In a successive work, I have then investigated a novel design for the amphiphilic nucleosidic complexes starting from a highly functionalized uridine-based nucleolipid. In this optimized scaffold, the pyridine ligand for the metal complexation was attached on the sugar skeleton, in lieu of the N- 3 position on the nucleobase, {{as in the case of}} ToThyRu, HoThyRu, DoHuRu and ToThyCholRu complexes. A modified nucleoside, 3 -azido- 3 -deoxy- 1 --D-xylofuranosyluracil - here prepared following a new, simple and very convenient synthetic procedure - was also here exploited as a suitable key intermediate to obtain a cationic aminoacylnucleolipid, of interest per se, as a model compound of a valuable class of novel biocompatible, highly functionalized nucleolipids, and to be used in mixture with the naturally negatively charged ruthenium(III) complexes, thus producing catanionic vesicles. For all the latter compounds, including the nucleolipid-ruthenium(III) complexes and the cationic aminoacynucleolipid, a detailed microstructural characterization as well as biological activity assays are currently underway, in collaboration with specialized laboratories, and the related results will be presented in due course. 	In the frame of the design, synthesis and characterization of novel nucleolipids, a relevant part of my efforts have been then addressed to the study of guanosine-containing amphiphiles, almost unexplored compounds of interest in the development of smart, novel self-assembling materials as well as for their potential biological activity. A small library of sugar-modified guanosine derivatives has been prepared, starting from a common intermediate, fully protected on the nucleobase. Insertion of myristoyl chains and of diverse hydrophilic groups, such as an oligoethylene glycol, an amino acid or a disaccharide chain, connected through in vivo reversible ester linkages, or of a charged functional group provided different examples of amphiphilic guanosine analogs, named G 1 -G 7 herein. All of the sugar-modified derivatives were positive in the potassium picrate test, showing a marked ability to form G-tetrads. CD spectra demonstrated that, as dilute solutions in CHCl 3, distinctive G-quadruplex systems may be formed, with spatial organisations dependent upon the structural modifications. Two compounds, G 1 and G 2, proved to be good low-molecular-weight organogelators in polar organic solvents, such as methanol, ethanol and acetonitrile. Ion transportation experiments through phospholipid bilayers were carried out to evaluate their ability to mediate H+ transportation, with G 5 showing the highest activity within the investigated series. Moreover, G 3 and G 5 exhibited a significant cytotoxic profile against human MCF- 7 cancer cells in in vitro bioassays with IC 50 values in the 20 M range, while no cytotoxic activity was observed on normal, control cells. Finally, to expand the knowledge about the available protective groups for nucleosides, the use of Boc as a thymine protecting group in the synthesis of sugar-alkylated (or, more generally, sugar-modified) thymidine analogs was here described. Boc was easily inserted at the 3 -N position in high yields and found to be stable to standard treatments for the removal of acetyl and TBDMS groups, as well as to ZnBr 2 -mediated DMTr deprotection. Boc protection proved to be completely resistant to the strong basic conditions required to selectively achieve 3 ’-O-alkylation. This acid-labile group, unprecedentedly used for the masking of pyrimidine nucleobases, was then here exploited to allow the synthesis of 3 -azido- 3 -deoxy- 1 --D-xylofuranosyluracil in six, high yielding steps from uridine, previously mentioned as a valuable starting material for the synthesis of novel, highly functionalized nucleolipids. From the full comprehension of the structure-activity relationships of the here described compounds, a relevant contribution to the knowledge of nucleolipid ruthenium(III) -complexes, as promising anticancer agents, and more generally of novel nucleoside-based amphiphiles as attractive, bioinspired building blocks of use in the production of innovative, smart materials for biomedical applications is expected...|$|E

To solve the disadvantages of this classical method, various high-throughput evaluation techniques have been developed recently such as Biolog’s Penotype Microarrays, <b>Bioscreen</b> C, and BioLector. Phenotype Microarray system {{has been used to}} profile nearly 2000 Z. mobilis cellular phenotypes and provided an overview of Z. mobilis physiology (Bochner et al. 2010). In addition, a quantitative high-throughput biological growth assay based on turbidometric measurements using the <b>Bioscreen</b> C system was also established. This approach is capable of monitoring two 100 -well plates at a 0.4 -mL scale simultaneously, and has been widely used for cellular growth measurement in the presence of inhibitors and hydrolysate (Franden et al. 2009, 2013). It can provide detailed inhibitory kinetic data for individual inhibitory compounds in terms of continuing cellular growth and final cell mass.|$|R

Biomass hydrolysates, prepared with a procedure including pretreatment and hydrolysis, {{are considered to be}} used as fermentation media for microorganisms, such as yeast. During the hydrolysate preparation procedure, toxic compounds are released or formed which may inhibit the growth of the microorganism and thus the product formation. To study the effects of these compounds on fermentation performance, the production of various hydrolysates with diverse inhibitory effects is of importance. A platform of methods that generates hydrolysates through four different ways and tests their inhibitory effects using <b>Bioscreen</b> C Analyzer growth tests is described here. The four methods, based on concentrated acid, dilute acid, mild alkaline and alkaline/ oxidative conditions, were used to prepare hydrolysates from six different biomass sources. The resulting 24 hydrolysates showed great diversity on growth rate in <b>Bioscreen</b> C Analyzer growth tests.

40|$|Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli were {{stressed}} by prolonged incubation in water microcosms {{until it was}} no longer possible to observe colony formation when samples were plated on nonselective medium. Overnight incubation of samples in nutrient-rich broth medium supplemented with growth factors, however, allowed resuscitation of stressed and viable but nonculturable cells so that subsequent plating yielded observable colonies for significantly extended periods of time. The growth factors were (i) the trihydroxamate siderophore ferrioxamine E (for Salmonella only), (ii) the commercially available antioxidant Oxyrase, and (iii) the heat-stable autoinducer of growth secreted by enterobacterial species in response to norepinephrine. Analysis of water microcosms with the <b>Bioscreen</b> C apparatus confirmed that these supplements enhanced recovery of cells in stressed populations; enterobacterial autoinducer was the most effective, promoting resuscitation in populations that were so heavily stressed that ferrioxamine E or Oxyrase had no effect. Similar results were observed in <b>Bioscreen</b> analysis of bacterial populations {{stressed by}} heating. Patterns of resuscitation of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium rpoS mutants from water microcosms and heat stress were qualitatively similar, suggesting that the general stress response controlled by the σs subunit of RNA polymerase plays no role in autoinducer-dependent resuscitation.

40|$|Aims: To {{develop a}} novel, rapid method for testing {{the ability of}} {{quenching}} agents to neutralize disinfectants. Methods and Results: Tests were performed to determine the suitability of different neutralizers {{for a range of}} disinfectants, using a new method based on the <b>Bioscreen</b> optical density analyser. Results showed that during disinfection tests, efficacy could be over-estimated due to poor, or no, neutralization of the disinfectant after a specified time of exposure to the bacteria. The failure to distinguish adequately between bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects can lead to false results during disinfectant testing. Experiments also showed that dilution of the disinfectant, following exposure to the bacteria, was not always sufficient to stop the activity of the disinfectant for chemicals with low dilution coefficients. Conclusions: The quench test proved to be very quick and easy to perform, with results being available within 18 h. Using the <b>Bioscreen,</b> the test is automated and determines whether dilution into a particular neutralizer is able to inactivate a disinfectant within 30 s. Significance and Impact of the Study: This new approach allows the efficacy of quenching agents to be determined, prior to undertaking each disinfection study, and can help in the development of more suitable quenching solutions. The test has also been used to find suitable neutralizers for mixtures of disinfectants which might be used during studies on synergistic biocide combinations...|$|R
