5|$|One {{published}} {{study that}} analysed samples of mephedrone bought {{using the internet}} in the UK in 2010 found it was racemic (a mixture of both stereoisomers) and of high purity. An unpublished study of six samples also ordered off the internet in the UK in 2010 found they contained very few organic impurities. Four products sold in Irish head shops were tested in 2010 and were found to contain between 82% and 14% mephedrone, with some products containing <b>benzocaine</b> and caffeine.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{analgesic}} solutions, {{the active}} ingredient usually being phenol, but also less commonly <b>benzocaine,</b> cetylpyridinium chloride and/or menthol. Chloraseptic and Cēpacol are two examples of brands {{of these kinds of}} analgesics.|$|E
25|$|Infants under 6 {{months of}} age have lower levels of a key methemoglobin {{reduction}} enzyme (NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase) in their red blood cells. This results in a major risk of methemoglobinemia caused by nitrates ingested in drinking water, dehydration (usually caused by gastroenteritis with diarrhea), sepsis, or topical anesthetics containing <b>benzocaine</b> or prilocaine. Nitrates used in agricultural fertilizers may leak {{into the ground and}} may contaminate well water. The current EPA standard of 10 ppm nitrate-nitrogen for drinking water is specifically set to protect infants. <b>Benzocaine</b> applied to the gums or throat (as commonly used in baby teething gels, or sore throat lozenges) can cause methemoglobinemia.|$|E
25|$|When the {{antennae}} of rockpool prawns Palaemon elegans are rubbed with {{sodium hydroxide}} or acetic acid (both are irritants in mammals), they increase grooming and rubbing of the afflicted area {{against the side}} of the tank; this reaction is inhibited by <b>benzocaine</b> (a local anaesthetic in mammals), even though control prawns treated with only anaesthetic do not show reduced activity.|$|E
25|$|In {{otherwise}} healthy individuals, the protective enzyme systems normally present in {{red blood cells}} rapidly reduce the methemoglobin back to hemoglobin and hence maintain methemoglobin levels at {{less than one percent}} of the total hemoglobin concentration. Exposure to exogenous oxidizing drugs and their metabolites (such as <b>benzocaine,</b> dapsone, and nitrates) may lead to an increase of up to a thousandfold of the methemoglobin formation rate, overwhelming the protective enzyme systems and acutely increasing methemoglobin levels.|$|E
25|$|Oral and topical pain killers are {{effective}} {{to treat the}} pain caused by otitis media. Oral agents include ibuprofen, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and opiates. Topical agents shown to be effective include antipyrine and <b>benzocaine</b> ear drops. Decongestants and antihistamines, either nasal or oral, are not recommended {{due to the lack}} of benefit and concerns regarding side effects. Half of cases of ear pain in children resolve without treatment in three days and 90% resolve in seven or eight days. The use of steroids is not supported by the evidence for acute otitis media.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} with {{intravenous}} use include sleepiness, muscle twitching, confusion, changes in vision, numbness, tingling, and vomiting. It can cause low {{blood pressure and}} an irregular heart rate. There are concerns that injecting it into a joint can cause problems with the cartilage. It appears to be generally safe for use in pregnancy. A lower dose may be required in those with liver problems. It is generally safe to use in those allergic to tetracaine or <b>benzocaine.</b> Lidocaine is an antiarrhythmic medication of the class Ib type. Lidocaine works by blocking sodium channels and thus decreasing the rate of contractions of the heart. When used locally as a numbing agent, local neurons cannot signal the brain.|$|E
25|$|Special {{departments}} {{were prepared}} engineers for industries which {{were still being}} created {{in the first five}} years. At the time, were of great importance establishment of a domestic pharmaceutical industry and the country's liberation on imports of medicines. Were developed and implemented methods of production of such drugs as atophan, <b>benzocaine,</b> procaine, bromural, thiokol, ichtyol, validol, antipyrine, caffeine, alkaloids and others. In 1938, in MITHT under the leadership of academic A. N. Nesmeyanov (later President of the RAS) began work in the field of organometallic compounds. Also, the Institute prepared professionals for the companies producing such important national defense materials, such as tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, and rare-earth elements. So, Professor I. Ya. Bashilov created the production technology of uranium and radium. And under the guidance of Professor G. A. Meyerson were carried out important work on carbothermy and getting super-hard alloys.|$|E
25|$|Local anesthetics {{are broken}} down into 2 categories: ester-linked and amide-linked drugs. The esters include <b>benzocaine,</b> procaine, tetracaine, and chloroprocaine. The amides include {{lidocaine}}, mepivacaine, prilocaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine. Chloroprocaine is a short-acting drug (45–90 minutes), lidocaine and mepivacaine are intermediate duration (90–180 minutes), and bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine are long-acting (4–18 hours). Drugs commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks include lidocaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine, and mepivacaine. These drugs are often combined with adjuvants (additives) with the end goal of increasing {{the duration of the}} analgesia or shortening time of onset. Additives may include epinephrine, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine. Vasoconstriction caused by local anesthetic may be further enhanced synergistically with the addition of epinephrine, the most widely used additive. Epinephrine increases the length of analgesic duration and decreases blood flow by acting as an agonist at the α1-adrenoceptor. Dexmedetomidine is not as widely used as epinephrine. Studies in humans indicate improved onset time and increased duration of analgesia.|$|E
500|$|No method [...] eradicates {{herpes virus}} from the body, but {{antiviral}} medications {{can reduce the}} frequency, duration, and severity of outbreaks. [...] Analgesics such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) can reduce pain and fever. [...] Topical anesthetic treatments such as prilocaine, lidocaine, <b>benzocaine,</b> or tetracaine can also relieve itching and pain.|$|E
500|$|Soring can be also {{detected}} by observing the horse for lameness, assessing its stance and palpating the lower legs. Some trainers evaded detection from inspectors by training horses not {{to react to}} the pain that palpation may cause, often by severely punishing the horse for flinching after the sored area is touched. The practice is called [...] "stewarding", in reference to the horse show steward. Others use topical anesthetics, such as lidocaine and <b>benzocaine,</b> which are timed to wear off before the horse goes into the show ring. Use of chemicals can be completely avoided if pressure shoeing is also used. This process involves placing some type of hard foreign object (such as a small piece of wood, stone, hard acrylic, or sharp object such as a tack or nail) against the sole of the horse's foot before applying the horseshoe and pads. [...] It can also be done by trimming down the horse's hoof to its sensitive structures, then shoeing. Either method causes pain when the horse places its foot on the ground.|$|E
2500|$|Met{{hemoglobin}}emia is {{a process}} where iron in hemoglobin is altered, reducing its oxygen-carrying capability, which produces cyanosis and symptoms of hypoxia. [...] <b>Benzocaine,</b> lidocaine, and prilocaine all produce this effect, especially <b>benzocaine.</b> The systemic toxicity of prilocaine is comparatively low, but its metabolite, o-toluidine, is known to cause methemoglobinemia.|$|E
2500|$|Methemoglobinemia may be acquired. [...] Classical drug {{causes of}} methemoglobinaemia include {{antibiotics}} (trimethoprim, sulfonamides, and dapsone), local anesthetics (especially articaine, <b>benzocaine,</b> and prilocaine), and aniline dyes, metoclopramide, rasburicase, [...] chlorates, and bromates. Ingestion of compounds containing nitrates (such as the patina chemical bismuth nitrate) {{can also cause}} methemoglobinemia.|$|E
2500|$|According to an Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet: ...After {{returning}} from a chigger-infested area, launder the field clothes in soapy, hot water (125°F.) ....As soon as possible, take a good hot bath or shower and soap repeatedly. The chiggers may be dislodged, but you will still have the stylostomes, causing the severe itch. Scratching deep to remove stylostomes can cause secondary infections. For temporary relief of itching, apply ointments of <b>benzocaine,</b> hydrocortisone, calamine lotion, New Skin, After Bite, or others recommended by your pharmacist or medical doctor. Some use Vaseline, cold cream, baby oil, or fingernail polish. (The sooner the treatment, the better the results.)....|$|E
2500|$|Topical {{analgesia}} {{is generally}} recommended to avoid systemic side-effects. [...] Painful joints, for example, may {{be treated with}} an ibuprofen- or diclofenac-containing gel (The labeling for topical diclofenac has been updated to warn about drug-induced hepatotoxicity.); capsaicin also is used topically. [...] Lidocaine, an anesthetic, and steroids may be injected into painful joints for longer-term pain relief. [...] Lidocaine is also used for painful mouth sores and to numb areas for dental work and minor medical procedures. In February 2007 the FDA notified consumers and healthcare professionals of the potential hazards of topical anesthetics entering the blood stream when applied in large doses to the skin without medical supervision. These topical anesthetics contain anesthetic drugs such as lidocaine, tetracaine, <b>benzocaine,</b> and prilocaine in a cream, ointment, or gel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzocaine</b> is the {{ethyl ester}} of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). It can be {{prepared}} from PABA and ethanol by Fischer esterification or via the reduction of ethyl p-nitrobenzoate. <b>Benzocaine</b> is sparingly soluble in water; it is more soluble in dilute acids and very soluble in ethanol, chloroform and ethyl ether. The melting point of <b>benzocaine</b> is 88-90 °C, and the boiling point is about 310 °C. The density of <b>benzocaine</b> is 1.17 g/cm3.|$|E
5000|$|The {{marketing}} {{start date}} for Cetacaine was January 1, 1960, but <b>benzocaine</b> was first produced in 1890 by German scientist 1890 by Eduard Ritsert. Cetacaine is mainly {{used in the}} dental field but has seen use {{as well in the}} medical field when dealing with small surgeries on or around mucus membranes. <b>Benzocaine</b> based anesthetics (which includes Cetacaine) have started to come scrutiny by the FDA. In 2006 the FDA has announced that <b>Benzocaine</b> based anesthetics can cause methemoglobinemia and with that listed warnings and precautions to take when dealing with <b>benzocaine</b> based drugs. [...] The FDA also during this time started to take many <b>Benzocaine</b> based drugs that were not approved off the market and fining those companies they were under.|$|E
