Design/methodology/approach – Several screening tests, such as Rockwell <b>indentations,</b> <b>ball</b> cratering, pin-on-disc and reciprocating wear tests, were performed in order to evaluate the adhesion to the substrate and the tribological performance of the carbon/chromium composite coating. Afterwards, twin-disc tests were performed at high contact pressure and high slide-to-roll ratios to confirm the good adhesive and tribological {{properties of the coating}} under operating conditions similar to those found in gears. Gear tests were performed in the FZG machine in order to evaluate the anti-scuffing performance of the carbon/chromium coating using additive free gear oils. Finally, the carbon/chromium composite coating was also applied to the gearing in a gearbox and its influence on the gearbox efficiency was analysed.

40|$|It {{is now a}} well {{established}} fact that fatigue cracks initiate from persistent slip bands (PSBs). Previous work on copper fatigued in reverse bending has revealed that the PSBs form much earlier near indentations or surface pits than in regions well away from them. The cause of this effect has been attributed partly to a dislocation microstructure introduced by the indentations as well as possible contribution from the residual stresses resulting from them and geometric stress raising effects. To study this phenomenon in a greater depth, an attempt {{has been made to}} make a comprehensive study of the plastic deformation around indentations and to study their effect on the low ampltude fatigue cycling of mono and polycrystalline copper. This effect has been studied using both surface as well as Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) observations. The project was divided into four main categories; a study of the deformation around indentations; a study of the fatigue cycling mechanism; a study of the low strain amplitude fatigue cycling of the indented specimens and a study of the effect of indentation on the fatigued specimens. The surface topographical studies were made on specially designed polycrystalline and single crystal specimens of copper. The transmission electron microscope study has been done mainly on thin strips sliced and prepared from two bulk single crystals with axial orientation close to [124] and [012]. The dislocation structures due to indentations were studied in regions at different positions in relation to the indentations and included a study of the microstructures close to the surface as well as ~ 50 mum from it. Specimens were fatigued in air, at room temperature, at total strain amplitudes in the range = 2 x 10 - 4 to 9. 8 x 10 - 4 for bulk specimens and a 0. 8 x 10 - 3 to 1. 9 x 10 - 3 for thin foil specimens. The number of fatigue cycles given to the specimens varied (from specimen to specimen) from a few cycles to several hundred thousand cycles. The Dyer model (1965) has been satisfactorily extended from <b>ball</b> to pyramid <b>indentations</b> to explain the hill formation and the general surface topography around indentations. Dislocation, microstructures around indentations in the 'indented' and 'indented and fatigued' specimens of the same orientation have been analysed and compared. Such an analysis has revealed that in the regions of indentations in which PSBs are initiated more readily, the dislocation microstructure due to indentation contained predominantly the Burgers vectors +/-a/ 2 [110] or +/-a/ 2 [011] and +/-a/ 2 [110] or +/-a/ 2 [011]. In contrast to these, the most frequently found Burgers vectors in the same regions of the indentation followed by fatigue were +/-a/ 2 [101] and +/-a/ 2 [011], which reveals that the Burgers vectors of the dislocations introduced by the indentation in these regions are quite favourable for the later stage of fatigue cycling, with an enhanced density of dislocations. A little work was also done to study the effect of the indentations made in the fatigued specimens. It has showed an enhancement of the inhomogeneous and anisotropic deformation around the indentations caused by fatigue cycling as well as a significantly different type of slip bands...|$|R
40|$|Poor powder flow {{leads to}} many {{problems}} during manufacturing {{and can lead}} to inaccurate dosing and off-specification products. Powder flowability is commonly assessed under relatively high applied loads using shear cells by characterising the unconfined yield strength at a range of applied loads. For applied stresses below 1 kPa, it becomes increasingly difficult to obtain reliable values of the unconfined yield strength. The bulk cohesion and tensile strength of the powder are then obtained by extrapolating the yield locus to zero and negative loads, respectively. However, the reliability of this approximation for a given material is not known. To overcome this limitation, techniques such as the Raining Bed Method, Sevilla Powder Tester and the newly-developed <b>Ball</b> <b>Indentation</b> Method may be used. In this paper, we report our measurement results of the tensile strength of glass beads, α-lactose monohydrate and various sizes of fluid catalytic cracking powders determined by the Sevilla Powder Tester and Raining Bed Method and compare them with those inferred from the Schulze Shear Cell. The results of the latter are also compared with those of the <b>Ball</b> <b>Indentation</b> Method. The outcome suggests {{that in the case of}} shear cell tests, the extrapolation of the yield locus to lower or negative loads is unsafe. The <b>ball</b> <b>indentation</b> method enables the characterisation of highly cohesive powders at very low compressive loads; however extrapolation to negative loads is still not reliable. In contrast, the Sevilla Powder Tester and Raining Bed Methods are able to characterise the tensile strength directly, but high bulk cohesion poses difficulties as the internal bed failure needs to be analysed in order to reliably estimate the tensile strength. These methods provide a better understanding of powder flow behaviour at low stresses, thus enabling a greater control of manufacturing processes...|$|E

Hence {{it is important to}} know the conditions under which it occurs. The caking behaviour of three powder materials (PVP, HPC and CaHPO 4) has been investigated by the <b>ball</b> <b>indentation</b> method (BIM) as affected by relative humidity (RH), temperature and time. The resistance to powder flow, as indicated by the hardness is measured by a ball indenting the powder bed surface. The surface hardness increases with increasing RH and temperature, indicating caking of the powder bed. Moreover, the temperature and RH show a coupled effect on powder caking. Irreversible caking is formed in PVP and HPC at 75 % RH; the particles coalesce and the volume of powder bed is significantly reduced with time. However, the caking of CaHPO 4 is reversible. To examine the caking mechanism of PVP and HPC, the critical glass transition RH is determined at 25 °C and 45 °C. The values are 63 % and 53 % RH for PVP and 61 % and 50 % RH for HPC, respectively.

40|$|AbstractRate of area {{reduction}} {{is an important}} mechanical characterization to appraise the plasticity of metals, which is always obtained from the uniaxial tensile test. A methodology is proposed to determine the area reduction rate by continuous <b>ball</b> <b>indentation</b> test technique. The continuum damage accumulation theory has been adopted in this work to identify the failure point in the indentation. According to this theory, the damage is accumulated in the material during the test with voids nucleating and growing, which {{can be divided into}} two stages due to the variation in the degree of constraint. The turning point between two stages can be identified as the failure point where the material beneath the indenter collapses. The corresponding indentation depth of this point can be obtained and used to estimate the area reduction rate. The local strain limit criterion proposed in the ASME VIII- 2 2007 alternative rules is also adopted in this research to convert the multiaxial strain of indentation test to uniaxial strain of tensile test. This method can be useful in engineering practice to evaluate the material degradation under severe working condition due to the non-destructive nature of <b>ball</b> <b>indentation</b> test.

Extensive work has been reported on the rapid chute flow of large granules but the intermediate regime has not been widely addressed particularly in the case of cohesive powders. However in industrial powder processes the powder flow is often in the intermediate regime. In the present work an attempt is made to investigate the sensitivity of the stresses in an assembly of cohesive spherical particles to the strain rate in <b>ball</b> <b>indentation</b> using the Distinct Element Method. This technique has recently been proposed as a quick and easy way to assess the flowability of cohesive powders. It is shown that the hardness, deviatoric and hydrostatic stresses within a bed, subjected to <b>ball</b> <b>indentation</b> on its free surface, are dependent on the indentation strain rate. These stresses are almost constant up to a dimensionless strain rate of unity, consistent with trends from traditional methods of shear cell testing, though fluctuations begin to increase from a dimensionless strain rate of 0. 5. For dimensionless strain rates greater than unity, these stresses increase, with the increase in hardness being the most substantial. These trends correlate well with those established in the literature for the Couette device. However the quantitative value of the strain rate boundary of the regimes differs, due to differences in the geometry of {{shear deformation}} bands.
