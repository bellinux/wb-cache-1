These Electro-Optical Deﬂectors (EODs) and Acousto-Optical Deﬂectors (AODs) do not contain moving parts and therefore exhibit high deﬂection velocities and are free of drawbacks associated with mechanical scanners. A description {{of the principles of}} operation of EODs and AODs is presented. In addition, characteristics, properties and the (dis) advantages of EODs and AODs, when compared to mirror based mechanical deﬂectors, is discussed. Deﬂection angles, speed and accuracy are discussed in terms of resolvable spots and related quantities. Also, response time, damage threshold, efficiency and the type and magnitude of beam distortions is addressed. Optical deﬂectors are characterized by high angular deﬂection velocities, but small deﬂection angles.

5|$|Breakout is {{the second}} studio album by American {{recording}} artist Miley Cyrus, released on July 22, 2008 by Hollywood Records. It is her first record that is not affiliated with the television series Hannah Montana, in which Cyrus portrays the title character Hannah Montana. She co-wrote eight of its thirteen tracks, several of which {{with the assistance of}} Antonina Armato and Tim James. The majority of the record was composed as she traveled during her headlining <b>Best</b> <b>of</b> <b>Both</b> <b>Worlds</b> Tour (200708).

5|$|The <b>Best</b> <b>of</b> <b>Both</b> <b>Worlds</b> Tour was created, by Kenny Ortega and Michael Cotten, to be video {{intensive}} and {{was meant to}} differentiate Cyrus from Hannah Montana as a performer. The show had Cyrus performing first under character, as Hannah Montana. She then performed a duet with the opening act, which continued performing an interlude of songs. For {{the latter half of}} the duet, a body double was used to facilitate the transition from Hannah Montana to herself. Videos online caused many fans to become outraged and question whether Cyrus lip-synched on the tour. Her representatives later issued a statement that denied the allegations and stated the reasons for the body double's usage. The fast-paced concert had six segments, divided equally between each persona.|$|E

5|$|The {{tour was}} titled <b>Best</b> <b>of</b> <b>Both</b> <b>Worlds</b> Tour after {{the song of}} the same name, which was the theme to Hannah Montana and was {{released}} on the series' first soundtrack. The title was chosen because of how the concert alternates between Cyrus performing as Hannah Montana and herself. She described the tour to differentiate the two according to their respective styles and depict how one girl was able to have two sides to her. She said the most notable difference between the two characters was the style of music, rather than physical appearance. According to her, Hannah Montana was direct pop music, while her own style was more rock music-oriented and included real-life scenarios set to tunes. Cyrus rehearsed for the tour simultaneous to filming the final episodes for the second season of Hannah Montana from September to October2007.|$|E
5|$|Cyrus is a singer-songwriter {{and actress}} who starred on the Disney Channel {{television}} series Hannah Montana as Miley Stewart, {{a girl with}} a secret double life as the popstar Hannah Montana. Through the television series, Cyrus developed fame as a teen idol and released music credited to Hannah Montana. Cyrus' debut studio album, titled Meet Miley Cyrus, was released as the second disc of the Hannah Montana 2/Meet Miley Cyrus (2007) double-disc album. In order to promote the album, Cyrus embarked on her first tour, the <b>Best</b> <b>of</b> <b>Both</b> <b>Worlds</b> Tour (2007–08), a North American tour where she performed both under character, as Hannah Montana, and as herself. With the release of Cyrus' second studio album, Breakout (2008), her first not be affiliated with the Hannah Montana franchise, and an extended play (EP) The Time of Our Lives (2009), Cyrus decided to embark on tour again with the Wonder World Tour, however, without incorporating performances as Hannah Montana, a step which the media interpreted as furthering her distance from the Hannah Montana franchise.|$|E

The tour would expand throughout North America, from October18,2007 in St. Louis, Missouri to January9,2008 in Albany, New York, {{with a total of}} fifty-four dates; fifty-three of which were in the United States and one which was in Canada. In October2007, another date was annexed in order to meet demand. In December2007, a fourteen-date extension of the tour was announced, with American duo Aly & A.J. opening seven of them; the opening act for the remaining dates was yet be announced. The extension featured new opening acts because the Jonas Brothers pulled out to record their then-forthcoming album A Little Bit Longer (2008). Subsequently, in the same month, one final date was annexed, and the American band Everlife was announced to as the final opening act. One dollar from each ticket purchased was donated to the City of Hope National Medical Center, a center dedicated to the prevention, treatment and research for the cure of cancer.
