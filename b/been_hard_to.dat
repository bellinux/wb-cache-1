5|$|Until the 1950s, the {{diagnosis}} of pituitary disease remained based on clinical features and visual field examination, sometimes aided by pneumoencephalography and X-ray tomography. Nevertheless, the field of pituitary surgery developed during this time. The major breakthrough in diagnosis came {{with the discovery of}} radioimmunoassay by Rosalyn Yalow and Solomon Berson in the late 1950s. This allowed the direct measurement of the hormones of the pituitary, which {{as a result of their}} low concentrations in blood had previously <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> measure. Stimulation tests were developed in the 1960s, and in 1973 the triple bolus test was introduced, a test that combined stimulation testing with insulin, GnRH and TRH. Imaging of the pituitary, and therefore identification of tumors and other structural causes, improved radically with the introduction of computed tomography in the late 1970s and magnetic resonance imaging in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|The rise in infestations has <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> track because bed bugs are not {{an easily}} {{identifiable}} problem.

50|$|Membrane {{proteins}} <b>are</b> inherently <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> design, {{in large}} part because it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> validate the designs experimentally for several reasons. Membrane proteins <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> purify. Their structure <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> characterize because they adopt their native conformation only {{in the presence of a}} membrane. Crystallization <b>is</b> inherently <b>hard,</b> and NMR studies of membrane proteins can fail because of their size.|$|R

25|$|Red wine {{has always}} <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> produce in the German climate, {{and in the}} past was usually light colored, closer to rosé or the red wines of Alsace. However {{recently}} there has been greatly increased demand and darker, richer red wines (often barrique aged) are produced from grapes such as Dornfelder and Spätburgunder, the German name for Pinot noir.|$|E
25|$|Maglev {{systems have}} been much more {{expensive}} to construct than conventional train systems, although the simpler construction of maglev vehicles makes them cheaper to manufacture and maintain. Despite over a century of research and development, maglev transport systems are in operation in just three countries (Japan, South Korea and China). The incremental benefits of maglev technology have often <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> justify against cost and risk, especially where there is an existing or proposed conventional high speed train line with spare passenger carrying capacity, as in continental Europe, the UK and Japan.|$|E
25|$|Many {{factors can}} affect marital and/or {{parenting}} difficulties, {{but there has}} not been any evidence found that can link these issues specifically to ACOAs. Research has been conducted to try to identify issues that arise when someone is a COA. It has <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> isolate these issues solely {{to the fact that the}} child’s parents are alcoholics. Other behaviors need to be studied, like dysfunctional family relationships, childhood abuse and other childhood stressors and how they may contribute to things like depression, anxiety and bad relationships in ACOAs.|$|E

25|$|Some {{companies}} {{included a}} complimentary blank cassette with their portable cassette recorders {{in the early}} 1980s. Panasonic's was a C14 and came with a song recorded on side one, and a blank side two. Except for C74 and C100, such non-standard lengths always have <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find, and {{tend to be more}} expensive than the more popular lengths. Home taping enthusiasts may have found certain lengths useful for fitting an album neatly on one or both sides of a tape. For instance, the initial maximum playback time of Compact Discs was 74 minutes, explaining the relative popularity of C74 cassettes.|$|E
25|$|As {{stated the}} 1775 Armstrong map of Ayrshire clearly shows a 'Chapel' marked, {{so it was}} known to exist at this time, however the remains would have been mined/removed {{over the years by}} local farmers and used for {{building}} work, etc. The remains of the chapel would have <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> locate by the early 18th century. Arrowsmith's 1807 map shows Chapel marked near Linshaw (Lainshaw) and no Laigh mentioned, while Ainslie's 1821 map shows a Chapel and a Laigh. It is likely that the term Chapel on most maps could be referring to a dwelling or farm and not the Chapel on the mound.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the film was {{nominated}} for best picture in the 35th Hong Kong Film Awards, the state-owned China Central Television announced that it would not live telecast the ceremony, as it had done every year since 1991. The online video website Tencent has said that it will also not cover the event. China's leading film review websites Douban and Mtime.com do not allow users to create a page for the film. Derek Yee, chairman of Hong Kong Film Awards, who presented the award to the directors, said that it had <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find anyone else to present the award, due to fears of being blacklisted for mainland opportunities.|$|E

25|$|Others, like Sir Robert Thompson, {{himself an}} ex-Chindit, have {{asserted}} that the idea behind the Chindits was a sound one, but {{that they were just}} badly handled and used in operations for which they were not properly equipped or trained, for example in static defence. A third view is that, despite the relatively insignificant losses that the Chindits were able to inflict, their propaganda value in 1943, {{at a time when the}} Army was on the defensive, was a morale boost to the people of India and Britain, and helping to dispel the image of Japanese invincibility. It has <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> reach a consensus on any of these issues due to the partisan nature of the discussions surrounding Wingate himself.|$|E
25|$|Five months later, the two {{met again}} in Biarritz in a regular season match. A massive fistfight, in which almost all players were {{involved}} broke out after just 5 minutes, after a scrum went up and the first rows exploded. The referee handed two yellows and two reds to Stade's Arnaud Marchois and BO's Imanol Harinordoquy. The rest was extremely rough, full of scuffles and insults. Stade {{went on to win}} 14–7. As can be expected, everyone condemned the other camp after the match. Biarritz coach Patrice Lagisquet assured Paris had assaulted his players to destabilise them, while the Parisians acknowledged that the overtime loss in the Top 14 final had <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> swallow, especially as they had the impression that Biarritz had overemphasised the physical side. Ever since, the matches between the two teams have been relatively quiet.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{discovery}} of Tutankhamun's mummy, {{there has been a}} lot of speculation and theories on the exact cause of death, which until recent studies had <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> prove with the evidence and data available. While it was a widely debated topic for many Egyptologists, it had also spread to the general public as popular culture has come up with many conspiracy theories that played out in movies, TV shows, and fictional books. Author James Patterson has even recently written his own take in his book, The Murder of King Tut. There are many educated and respected Egyptologists as well as trained professionals in other fields who have devoted a lot of time researching Tutankhamun and who have varying beliefs to his cause of death. Some have stood by their theories even in light of new evidence. Some of the theories are better known and supported than others.|$|E

25|$|Complex {{and long}} history shaped Polish attitudes towards the Jews and Jewish attitudes towards the Poles, but the anti-Jewish {{sentiment}} in Poland had reached its zenith {{in the years}} leading to the Second World War. Between 1935 and 1937 seventy-nine Jews were killed and 500 injured in anti-Jewish incidents. National policy was such that the Jews who largely worked {{at home and in}} small shops were excluded from welfare benefits according to American commentators. Nevertheless, the impact of right-wing extremism would have <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> substantiate in towns with percentage of Jews equal or even higher than that of the non-Jewish Poles. In the provincial capital of Łuck Jews constituted 48.5% of the diverse multicultural population of 35,550 Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians and others. Łuck had the largest Jewish community in the voivodeship. In the capital of Brześć in 1936 Jews constituted 41.3% of general population and some 80.3% of private enterprises were owned by Jews. The 32% of Jewish inhabitants of Radom enjoyed considerable prominence also, with 90% of small businesses in the city owned and operated by the Jews including tinsmiths, locksmiths, jewellers, tailors, hat makers, hairdressers, carpenters, house painters and wallpaper installers, shoemakers, as well as most of the artisan bakers and clock repairers. In Lubartów, 53.6% of the town's population were Jewish also along with most of its economy. In a town of Luboml, 3,807 Jews lived among its 4,169 inhabitants, constituting the essence of its social and political life.|$|E

Two walls ran alongside either side of the blockhouse, parallel with the river, forming part of the adjacent platforms for mounting additional guns; in 1600, the east platform was described as being [...] long and [...] wide.
