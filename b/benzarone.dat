40|$|We report {{three cases}} of severe {{hepatotoxicity}} related to <b>benzarone,</b> a benzofuran derivative. Our cases include a 35 ‐year‐old woman with (sub) fulminant hepatitis, a 67 ‐year‐old woman with macronodular cirrhosis, and a 68 ‐year‐old man with severe {{chronic active hepatitis}} and cirrhosis, with positivity of anti‐smooth muscle antibodies. Two patients died. We stress the potential of <b>benzarone</b> to cause hepatotoxicity, which usually resembles severe chronic active hepatitis. Our cases constitute the most severe cases of <b>benzarone</b> hepatotoxicity reported so far, and comprise the first cases of (sub) fulminant hepatitis and cirrhosis related to <b>benzarone.</b> Copyright © 1995 MunksgaardSCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|A 46 -year-old {{woman with}} a {{previous}} history of thyroiditis but without clinical evidence of preexisting liver disease presented with severe acute hepatitis while under <b>benzarone</b> therapy (Fragivix(R), 400 mg per day, p. o.). Because of negative serological work-up, a tentative diagnosis of "sporadic" non-A, non-B hepatitis was considered. Two months after resolution, a relapse of clinical and biochemical features of hepatitis occurring 10 days after the spontaneous resumption of therapy led to the diagnosis of drug-induced liver damage. This case represents the third reported case of severe hepatitis related to <b>benzarone.</b> The mechanism of liver toxicity was likely due to hypersensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Eyes Absents (EYA) are {{multifunctional}} proteins {{best known}} for their role in organogenesis. There is accumulating evidence that overexpression of EYAs in breast and ovarian cancers, and in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, correlates with tumor growth and increased metastasis. The EYA protein is both a transcriptional activator and a tyrosine phosphatase, and the tyrosine phosphatase activity promotes single cell motility of mammary epithelial cells. Since EYAs are expressed in vascular endothelial cells and cell motility is a critical feature of angiogenesis we investigated the role of EYAs in this process. Using RNA interference techniques we show that EYA 3 depletion in human umbilical vein endothelial cells inhibits transwell migration as well as Matrigel-induced tube formation. To specifically query {{the role of the}} EYA tyrosine phosphatase activity we employed a chemical biology approach. Through an experimental screen the uricosuric agents Benzbromarone and <b>Benzarone</b> were found to be potent EYA inhibitors, and <b>Benzarone</b> in particular exhibited selectivity towards EYA versus a representative classical protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP 1 B. These compounds inhibit the motility of mammary epithelial cells over-expressing EYA 2 as well as the motility of endothelial cells. Furthermore, they attenuate tubulogenesis in matrigel and sprouting angiogenesis in the ex vivo aortic ring assay in a dose-dependent fashion. The anti-angiogenic effect of the inhibitors was also demonstrated in vivo, as treatment of zebrafish embryos led to significant and dose-dependent defects in the developing vasculature. Taken together our results demonstrate that the EYA tyrosine phosphatase activity is pro-angiogenic and that Benzbromarone and <b>Benzarone</b> are attractive candidates for repurposing as drugs for the treatment of cancer metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, and vasculopathies...|$|E
40|$|Research {{over the}} last decade has {{extended}} the prevailing view of mitochondrial function well beyond its critical bioenergetic role in supplying ATP. Recently, it has been recognized that mitochondria {{play a critical role in}} cell regulatory and signaling events, in the responses of cells to drug effects, genetic stresses and cell death. Based on this, four studies were conducted in order to gain more insight into several aspects of mitochondrial toxicity of drugs, consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction and role of mitochondria in cell death induction. Project 1 (Chapter 7) aimed to investigate the mechanisms leading to liver steatosis in rats treated with trimethylhydraziniumpropionate, an inhibitor of butyrobetaine hydroxylase. Rats were treated with trimethylhydraziniumpropionate for three or six weeks and were studied after 24 h of starvation. Beside the mechanisms leading to liver steatosis, we also investigated adaptive changes secondary to a decrease in the hepatic carnitine pool and to impaired in vivo mitochondrial β- oxidation. Our studies demonstrate that hepatic carnitine deficiency is the most important cause for liver steatosis in trimethylhydraziniumpropionate-treated rats and suggest that reduced mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation may be partially compensated by increased peroxisomal fatty acid metabolism due to proliferation of peroxisomes. Project 2 (Chapter 8) describes a study about hepatic toxicity of <b>benzarone</b> and benzbromarone having its source in clinical findings. Both drugs have similar structural features like amiodarone, a well-known mitochondrial toxin. Liver toxicity of <b>benzarone</b> and benzbromarone and of the two analogues benzofuran and 2 -butylbenzofuran was therefore investigated using freshly isolated rat hepatocytes or freshly isolated rat liver mitochondria. In particular, we were interested in mitochondrial mechanisms leading to cell damage or even death. We also investigated the structuretoxicity relationship by including the molecular analogues benzofuran and 2 -butylbenzofuran along with amiodarone, <b>benzarone</b> and benzbromarone in our studies. We could show that <b>benzarone,</b> benzbromarone as well as amiodarone are toxic to liver cells and liver mitochondria. The side chain at position 2 enhances the toxic potential to some extent but does not fully explain it. Bromide atoms in the p-hydroxybenzene moiety are not essential for the toxicity of these compounds but clearly enhance the toxic potential. The benzofuran structure alone was not responsible for the toxic effects. Hepatic injury associated with the ingestion of these drugs can be explained by mitochondrial damage with subsequent induction of cell death. Myotoxicity, rhabdomyolysis in particular, is a rare but severe adverse drug reaction of statins. The aim of project 3 (Chapter 9) was to evaluate the mitochondrial toxicity of five different statins and to assess their role in cell death induction in skeletal muscle cells. Lipophilic statins reduced cell viability and impaired mitochondrial functions, such as β-oxidation and respiratory chain, which are essential for cell survival. As a consequence, the mitochondrial membrane potential dissipated, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore opened and apoptosis inducing factors were released. Mitochondrial dysfunction and the subsequent release of mitochondrial proteins are tightly linked to the process of programmed cell death, also called apoptosis. Consistently, induction of apoptosis could be convincingly demonstrated, since lipophilic statins did cause DNA fragmentation and an increase in annexin V stained cells. Myotoxicity, a known side effect after treatment with statins, in particular rhabdomyolysis in response to lipophilic statin treatment can be explained at least in part by mitochondrial toxicity and the subsequent induction of apoptosis of myocytes. Project 4 (Chapter 10) was dealing with a putative drug-drug interaction. The aim of the study was to investigate the mechanisms by which venoocclusive disease was provoked in a patient, who was treated with immunodepressive doses of cyclophosphamide and roxithromycin. We therefore determined first the effect of roxithromycin on the metabolism of cyclophosphamide in vitro. Furthermore, by the use of cultured human umbilical endothelial cells, we could confirm the toxicity of the cyclophosphamide/roxithromycin combination and were able to investigate the underlying mechanisms of cell death induction. Roxithromycin causes an overall inhibition of hepatocyte cyclophosphamide metabolism and inhibition of P-glycoprotein, leading to an accumulation of cyclophosphamide in hepatocytes and possibly also endothelial cells. Apoptosis is the principle mechanism of toxicity of cyclophosphamide in endothelial cells, most probably associated with activation of the mitochondrial pathway of initiation of apoptosis...|$|E
40|$|Sporadic {{reports of}} mild hepatic {{dysfunction}} as an adverse reaction of Benzbromarone {{have appeared in}} recent years, and in some cases, fulminant hepatitis has developed. We first investigated metabolites of Benzbromarone, using LC/MS, and identified the metabolites of Benzbromarone in vitro. Results showed that human liver S 9 metabolites of Benzbromarone consist of two hydroxy bodies, two monohydroxy bodies and five 1 ’-ketone bodies; previous reports (except that debromination products were not detected) suggest that <b>Benzarone</b> (possibly related to hepatotoxicity) is not formed in humans. We also identified CYP molecular species related to the metabolism of Benzbromarone, by use of a human P 450 -expressing microsome system. We found that Benzbromarone is metabolized by CYP 2 C 9 * 1 and 2 C 9 * 2, and the main metabolite is 6 -hydroxylbenzbromarone. A study of the inhibitory action of Benzbromarone on human P 450 molecular species showed that Benzbromarone has especially potent inhibitory action on CYP 2 C 8 / 9. Therefore, {{it was clear that}} Benzbromarone is metabolized by CYP 2 C 9 and inhibits CYP 2 C 8 and CYP 2 C 9. Deaths caused by fulminant hepatitis in patients given the antidiabetic troglitazone (Noscal), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) -γ agonist, have recently been reported. It has also been reported that the mechanism of onset is by the induction of hepatocellular apoptosis by excessive increase of PPAR-γ activity. Because Benzbromarone has long been considered to be a peroxisome proliferating agent, we studied the action of Benzbromarone on PPAR-α and PPAR-γ. The results indicated that Benzbromarone is a ligand of PPAR-α. Our results suggest that the hepatic dysfunction associated with Benzbromarone is not caused by apoptosis...|$|E
