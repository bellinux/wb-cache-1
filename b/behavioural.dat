5|$|Adaptation is {{the central}} unifying concept in <b>behavioural</b> ecology. Behaviours can be {{recorded}} as traits and inherited {{in much the same}} way that eye and hair colour can. Behaviours can evolve by means of natural selection as adaptive traits conferring functional utilities that increases reproductive fitness.|$|E
5|$|As {{a coping}} mechanism, self-harm can become psychologically {{addictive}} because, to the self-harmer, it works; it enables {{him or her}} to deal with intense stress in the current moment. The patterns sometimes created by it, such as specific time intervals between acts of self-harm, can also create a <b>behavioural</b> pattern that can result in a wanting or craving to fulfill thoughts of self-harm.|$|E
5|$|<b>Behavioural</b> {{interventions}} {{attempt to}} identify and reduce the antecedents and consequences of problem behaviours. This approach has not shown success in improving overall functioning, but can help to reduce some specific problem behaviours, such as incontinence. There {{is a lack of}} high quality data on the effectiveness of these techniques in other behaviour problems such as wandering.|$|E
5|$|Costs {{increase}} with dementia severity {{and the presence}} of <b>behavioural</b> disturbances, and are related to the increased caregiving time required for the provision of physical care. Therefore, any treatment that slows cognitive decline, delays institutionalisation or reduces caregivers' hours will have economic benefits. Economic evaluations of current treatments have shown positive results.|$|E
5|$|During childhood, malaria causes anemia {{during a}} period of rapid brain development, and also direct brain damage {{resulting}} from cerebral malaria. Some survivors of cerebral malaria have an increased risk of neurological and cognitive deficits, <b>behavioural</b> disorders, and epilepsy. Malaria prophylaxis was shown to improve cognitive function and school performance in clinical trials when compared to placebo groups.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh Zoo {{is home to}} a {{world-class}} primate <b>behavioural</b> research centre, Living Links. Living Links consists of a field station and research centre that was developed in a partnership with the University of St Andrews. The centre houses capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys originating from the forests of South America, and offers researchers unique opportunities to study primate behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Elaborate sexual {{displays}} and posturing are {{encountered in the}} <b>behavioural</b> ecology of animals. The birds-of-paradise, for example, sing and display elaborate ornaments during courtship. These displays serve a dual purpose of signalling healthy or well-adapted individuals and desirable genes. The displays are driven by sexual selection as an advertisement of quality of traits among suitors.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairy-wrens, {{the superb}} fairy-wren is notable for several {{peculiar}} <b>behavioural</b> characteristics; {{the birds are}} socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females {{as part of a}} courtship display.|$|E
5|$|Mental disorders, such {{as major}} {{depressive}} disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, and addiction, are known {{to relate to the}} functioning of the brain. Treatment for mental disorders may include psychotherapy, psychiatry, social intervention and personal recovery work or cognitive <b>behavioural</b> therapy; the underlying issues and associated prognoses vary significantly between individuals.|$|E
5|$|Rasmussen’s {{early work}} was largely focused on {{studies of the}} systematics, ecology and {{behaviour}} of Patagonian seabirds, notably cormorants. She studied plumage variations in juvenile blue-eyed, king and red-legged cormorants, and used plumage and <b>behavioural</b> patterns to establish relationships between king and blue-eyed shags. She also reviewed the fishing activity of olivaceous cormorants.|$|E
5|$|The hawksbill {{sea turtle}} {{has been shown}} to be biofluorescent and is the first reptile {{recorded}} with this characteristic. It is unknown if this is derived from the turtle's diet, which includes biofluorescent organisms like the hard coral Physogyra lichtensteini. Males have more intense pigmentation than females, and a <b>behavioural</b> role of these differences is speculated.|$|E
5|$|The {{red deer}} {{population}} {{has been the subject}} of research for many years, recently under the leadership of Tim Clutton-Brock of the University of Cambridge. These efforts are based at the remote bay of Kilmory in the north of the island. It has been important in the development of sociobiology and <b>behavioural</b> ecology, particularly in relation to the understanding of aggression through game theory.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the large}} dabbling duck genus Anas, the {{northern}} pintail's closest relatives are other pintails, {{such as the}} yellow-billed pintail (A. georgica) and Eaton's pintail (A. eatoni). The pintails are sometimes separated in the genus Dafila (described by Stephens, 1824), an arrangement supported by morphological, molecular and <b>behavioural</b> data. The famous British ornithologist Sir Peter Scott gave this name to his daughter, the artist Dafila Scott.|$|E
5|$|Some longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) are {{effective}} Batesian mimics of wasps. Beetles may combine coloration with <b>behavioural</b> mimicry, acting like the wasps they already closely resemble. Many other beetles, including ladybirds, blister beetles, and lycid beetles secrete distasteful or toxic substances {{to make them}} unpalatable or poisonous, and are often aposematic, where bright or contrasting coloration warn off predators; many beetles and other insects mimic these chemically protected species.|$|E
25|$|<b>Behavioural</b> change {{theories}} {{can be used}} {{as guides}} in developing effective teaching methods. Since the goal of much education is <b>behavioural</b> change, the understanding of behaviour afforded by <b>behavioural</b> change theories provides insight into the formulation of effective teaching methods that tap into the mechanisms of <b>behavioural</b> change. In an era when education programs strive to reach large audiences with varying socioeconomic statuses, the designers of such programs increasingly strive to understand the reasons behind <b>behavioural</b> change in order to understand universal characteristics that may be crucial to program design.|$|E
25|$|Empirical {{studies in}} {{criminology}} support <b>behavioural</b> change theories. At the same time, the general theories of <b>behavioural</b> change suggest possible explanations to criminal behaviour {{and methods of}} correcting deviant behaviour. Since deviant behaviour correction entails <b>behavioural</b> change, understanding of <b>behavioural</b> change can facilitate the adoption of effective correctional methods in policy-making. For example, the understanding that deviant behaviour like stealing may be learned behaviour resulting from reinforcers like hunger satisfaction that are unrelated to criminal behaviour can aid the development of social controls that address this underlying issue rather than merely the resultant behaviour.|$|E
25|$|<b>Behavioural</b> change {{theories}} are not universally accepted. Criticisms include the theories' emphases on individual behaviour {{and a general}} disregard for the influence of environmental factors on behaviour. In addition, as some theories were formulated as guides to understanding behaviour while others were designed as frameworks for <b>behavioural</b> interventions, the theories' purposes are not consistent. Such criticism illuminates {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the theories, showing that there is room for further research into <b>behavioural</b> change theories.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{years have}} seen an {{increased}} interest in energy consumption reduction based on <b>behavioural</b> change, be it for reasons of climate change mitigation or energy security. The application of <b>behavioural</b> change theories {{in the field of}} energy consumption behaviour yields interesting insights. For example, it supports criticism of a too narrow focus on individual behaviour and a broadening to include social interaction, lifestyles, norms and values as well as technologies and policies—all enabling or constraining <b>behavioural</b> change.|$|E
25|$|<b>Behavioural</b> change {{theories}} are attempts {{to explain why}} behaviours change. These theories cite environmental, personal, and <b>behavioural</b> characteristics as the major factors in <b>behavioural</b> determination. In recent years, there has been increased interest {{in the application of}} these theories in the areas of health, education, criminology, energy and international development with the hope that understanding <b>behavioural</b> change will improve the services offered in these areas. Some scholars have recently introduced a distinction between models of behavior and theories of change. Whereas models of behavior are more diagnostic and geared towards understanding the psychological factors that explain or predict a specific behavior, theories of change are more process-oriented and generally aimed at changing a given behavior. Thus, from this perspective, understanding and changing behavior are two separate but complementary lines of scientific investigation.|$|E
