This structure accurately predicts the copolymerization of hybridized mixtures of HbS with HbA or HbC (beta 6 Glu [...] >Lys), {{which could not be}} reconciled with prior models in which only half the <b>beta</b> 6 <b>sites</b> were required for assembly.

40|$|International audienceIn this study, a monomeric (MB) and a dimeric (DB) bisbenzimidazoles were {{identified}} as novel proteasome inhibitors of the trypsin-like activity located on <b>beta</b> 2 c <b>sites</b> of the constitutive 20 S proteasome (IC 50 values at 2 - 4 mu M range). Remarkably, they were further shown to be 100 - and 200 -fold more potent inhibitors of the immunoproteasome trypsin-like activity (<b>beta</b> 2 i <b>sites,</b> IC 50 = 24 nM) than of the homologous constitutive activity. Molecular models of inhibitor/enzyme complexes in {{the two types of}} trypsin-like sites and corresponding computed binding energy values corroborated kinetic data. Different binding modes were suggested for MB and DB to the beta 2 c and beta 2 i trypsic sites. Each pointed to better contacts of the ligand inside the beta 2 i active <b>site</b> than for <b>beta</b> 2 c <b>site.</b> MB and DB represent the first selective inhibitors of the immunoproteasome trypsin-like activity described to date and can be considered as prototypes for inhibiting this activity...|$|R

40|$|Atomic scale {{modifications}} {{and subsequent}} atomic resolution imaging {{has been achieved}} on the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite surface in air. Application of short pulse voltages, above a minimum threshold voltage of 3. 5 V, across the tunneling gap results in the displacement of a layer or more of atoms to form a hole and create a neighboring mound or ‘‘nanodot’’ from the displaced atoms. We have found a correlation between the hole and ‘‘nanodot’’ volume at the atomic level and observe an asymmetric displacement of material in all cases of feature creation. Nanofeatures as small as four carbon atoms at <b>beta</b> <b>sites</b> have been created. Our experimental observations {{are consistent with the}} modification process depending on the gradient in the electric field induced by the rise time of the bias pulse voltage and not the pulse duration. Interesting faceting behavior has also been observed around some hole edges. Tip bias pulsing sometimes induced a tip, and not a surface modification, resulting in a change in the observed tunneling image...|$|R
40|$|This {{quarterly}} {{technical progress}} report will summarize work accomplished for the Program through the ninth quarter April-June 2002 {{in the following}} task areas: Task 1 [...] Oxygen Enhanced Combustion, Task 2 [...] Oxygen Transport Membranes, Task 3 [...] Economic Evaluation and Task 4 [...] Program Management. The program is proceeding {{in accordance with the}} objectives for the third year. Full-scale testing using the Industrial Boiler Simulation Facility (ISBF) at Alstom Power was completed. The pilot scale experiments to evaluate the effect of air preheat and transport air stoichiometric ratio (SR) on NOx emissions were conducted at the University of Utah. Combustion modeling activities continued with full-scale combustion test furnace simulations. An OTM element was tested in Praxair's single tube high-pressure test facility and two thermal cycles were completed. PSO 1 d elements of new dimension were tested resulting in a lower flux than previous PSO 1 d elements of different dimensions, however, no element deformation was observed. Economic evaluation has confirmed the advantage of oxygen-enhanced combustion. Two potential host <b>beta</b> <b>sites</b> have been identified and proposals submitted...|$|R

40|$|The Man-machine Design and Analysis System (MIDAS) is a {{human factors}} design and {{analysis}} system that combines human cognitive models with 3 D CAD models and rapid prototyping and simulation techniques. MIDAS allows designers to ask 'what if' types of questions early in concept exploration and development prior to actual hardware development. The system outputs predictions of operator workload, situational awareness and system performance as well as graphical visualization of the cockpit designs interacting with models of the human in a mission scenario. Recently, MIDAS was re-designed to enhance functionality and usability. The goals driving the redesign include more efficient processing, GUI interface, advances in the memory structures, implementation of external vision models and audition. These changes were detailed in an earlier paper. Two <b>Beta</b> test <b>sites</b> with diverse applications have been chosen. One <b>Beta</b> test <b>site</b> is investigating {{the development of a}} new airframe and its interaction with the air traffic management system.
