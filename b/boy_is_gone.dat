6000|$|Another {{piece of}} {{intelligence}} was certainly to be expected, {{but now it}} has come afflicts us much. Poor Johnny Lockhart! The <b>boy</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> whom we have made so much of. I could not have borne it better than I now do, and I might have borne it much worse.[509] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's fair, and I don't press you to agree. Stick to {{your full}} claim, if you like, and you'll get your {{interest}} {{on what you}} actually lent, but on nothing more until payment of the principal is due. Then we'll give you all the trouble we can. But your hold on the <b>boy</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> {{now that you know}} the money's ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quick. We {{must start}} now. I {{am sorry to}} tell you that I have vainly sought your dog. I have even paid detectives who were robbers. Doctor Emory stole Killeny Boy from you, but within a dozen hours he was stolen from Doctor Emory. I have left no stone unturned. Killeny <b>Boy</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone,</b> as we shall be gone from this detestable hole of a city.|$|E

60|$|The <b>boy</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> instantly, his agony {{relieved}} by {{the chance of}} action, and followed by the lawyer, Uncle John carried his niece to the rose chamber and laid her upon her white bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "All the <b>boys</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> to join Rutherford and lam the Indians," [...] she continued, [...] "so Gran'pa and I {{had to go}} to the settlements. There wahn't any one else. What's your name?" [...] {{she demanded}} suddenly.|$|R
6000|$|I {{went into}} the box frankly, and setting the silver tankard {{on the corner of}} the bench, I sat down before it, and knocked with my foot; a boy came presently, and I bade him fetch me a pint of warm ale, for it was cold weather; the boy ran, and I heard him go down the cellar to draw the ale. While the boy was gone, another boy came into the room, and cried, 'D' ye call?' I spoke with a melancholy air, and said, 'No, child; the <b>boy</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> for a pint of ale for me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sam," [...] says Bill, [...] "I suppose you'll think I'm a renegade, but I couldn't help it. I'm a grown {{person with}} {{masculine}} proclivities and habits of self-defense, {{but there is}} a time when all systems of egotism and predominance fail. The <b>boy</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone.</b> I have sent him home. All is off. There was martyrs in old times," [...] goes on Bill, [...] "that suffered death rather than give up the particular graft they enjoyed. None of 'em ever was subjugated to such supernatural tortures as I have been. I tried to be faithful to our articles of depredation; but there came a limit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “By heavens! You {{know that}} I hunted high and low. I ran {{the risk of}} giving myself away to find {{somebody}} for that accursed job. And I tell you again I couldn’t find anyone crazy enough or hungry enough. What do you take me for—a murderer, or what? The <b>boy</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone.</b> Do you think I wanted him to blow himself up? He’s gone. His troubles are over. Ours {{are just going to}} begin, I tell you, precisely because he did blow himself. I don’t blame you. But just try to understand that it was a pure accident; as much an accident {{as if he had been}} run over by a ’bus while crossing the street.” ...|$|E
60|$|Patsy signed, bothering {{her head}} the while {{to know what}} the little package {{contained}} and who could have sent it. Then the <b>boy</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> and she came back slowly to the breakfast table, with the thing in her hand.|$|R
60|$|Thinking {{that the}} display of Caddy's {{wardrobe}} {{would be the best}} means of approaching the subject, I invited Mrs. Jellyby to come and look at it spread out on Caddy's bed in the evening after the unwholesome <b>boy</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|R
60|$|When Jone {{gave the}} {{remarkable}} order mentioned in my last letter I did not correct him, for I wouldn't do that before servants without {{giving him a}} chance to do it himself; but before either of us could say another word the <b>boy</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|R
60|$|Now Love and Pride, alas! in vain, Up {{and down}} their glances strain. The painted sled stands where it stood; The kennel by the corded wood; His {{gathered}} sticks to stanch the wall Of the snow-tower, when snow should fall; The ominous hole he dug in the sand, And childhood's castles built or planned; His daily haunts I well discern,-- The poultry-yard, the shed, the barn,-- And {{every inch of}} garden ground Paced by the blessed feet around, From the roadside to the brook Whereinto he loved to look. Step the meek fowls where erst they ranged; The wintry garden lies unchanged; The brook into the stream runs on; But the deep-eyed <b>boy</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{convenience}} store manager gives Okutsu some additional information: the pair {{was at his}} {{convenience store}}, where Daddy spotted a dirty-looking young boy attempting to steal bread. He buys it for him instead, and the boy invites himself into Daddy's car. Daddy agrees to take him wherever he wants to go, but the boy is mostly silent. They sleep in the car, {{and the next morning}} Daddy discovers that the <b>boy</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> and has taken his wallet.|$|E
50|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} the girls {{preparing for an}} appearance on a show at a TV studio. The video begins with a young boy dressed in a tuxedo entering the girls' dressing room to give them congratulatory flowers only to sneakily take pictures of them and quickly flee as Keren tries to chase {{him out of the}} room. As soon as the <b>boy</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone,</b> the girls see a TV news report on poverty situations which is actually being made in the studio next door, and presented by BBC newscaster Peter Woods, who made a cameo in the videoclip. The studio director comes by and leads the girls to the studio where they will be filming their appearance but as he is looking away, the girls head into the other studio. They end up hijacking the news broadcast in order to get their message out to the public.|$|E
6000|$|While the <b>boy</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> {{she takes}} the city lady aside, and talking softly, the mercer and his partner, seeing them talk together, withdrew, but waited at a {{distance}} {{to be ready to}} hand them to the coach. So they began a new discourse, as follows:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Nigel was sharply awakened {{from his}} dream {{by a sudden}} splash. Looking up he {{observed}} that the small <b>boy</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b> With a bound he stood erect, {{one foot on the}} gunwale and hands clasped ready to dive, when a glance revealed the fact that Kathy was smiling broadly! ...|$|R
60|$|The painter was so startled {{that he gave}} {{utterance}} to a very oath of pity, and I felt {{a sinking}} myself, for in these hasty words my little <b>boy</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> indeed; all my bright dreams of Timothy, all my efforts to shelter him from Mary's scorn, went whistling down the wind.|$|R
5000|$|The {{story is}} told {{from the point of}} view of an Akita dog named Happie, adopted by a working-class Japanese family as a puppy and lives with them for several years. The dog enjoys living with them and {{especially}} appreciates the daily walks [...] "Daddy", the name he gives to the man of the family, takes him on. However, years later, the man's wife requests a divorce. Now homeless, jobless and with little money, an upbeat Daddy decides to take Happie on a road trip to southern Japan. Along the way, the pair stop at a convenience store, where Daddy spots a dirty-looking young boy attempting to steal bread. He buys it for him instead, and the boy invites himself into Daddy's car. Daddy agrees to take him wherever he wants to go, but the boy is mostly silent. They sleep in the car, and the next morning Daddy discovers that the <b>boy</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> and has taken his wallet. Not long after, Happie experiences extreme pain while urinating and Daddy rushes him to a veterinarian, where he learns that Happie has kidney stones. They operate, and Daddy is forced to pawn almost everything he owns to pay the bill, leaving him almost penniless. They continue on, eventually running out of gas near a campground. They live there for a while, living off the food they can scrounge and catch and sleeping in the car, until one day Daddy dies in his car of a preexisting heart condition. Happie continues to live there for two Winters until one day he perishes as well. The police discover their bodies about three months later, with Happie's loyaly body resting next to Daddy's feet.|$|E

Poor boys! they had got up a triumphal arch for your return, but I am afraid I am telling secrets. Dear Ermine is so good and resolutely composed--quite an example.--Yours affectionately, ...|$|R
60|$|When the <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone</b> a lull {{fell upon}} Plumfield, {{and the family}} {{scattered}} to various places for brief outings, as August had come and all felt the need of change. The Professor took Mrs Jo to the mountains. The Laurences were at the seashore, and there Meg's family and the Bhaer boys took turns to visit, as someone must always be at home to keep things in order.|$|R
60|$|The <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> to <b>go</b> {{home for}} the Christmas holidays, and under {{ordinary}} circumstances they would have felt gay over the prospect. But now it was different.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is all settled," [...] said Mrs. Pybus to Mrs. Speers, [...] "the <b>boy</b> <b>is</b> to <b>go</b> to College, {{and then}} the widow is to console herself." ...|$|R
60|$|All {{the boys}} stood still {{and stared at}} the hill-side, while the dogs fought on. The next thing they knew they were floundering among the vines and over the {{watermelon}} cores and shells and breaking for the woods; {{and as soon as the}} dogs found the <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone,</b> they seemed to think it was no use to keep on fighting with nobody to look on, and they took after the fellows.|$|R
60|$|One night, two {{or three}} weeks after the bridal return, when the <b>boy</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> to bed, Rhoda sat a long time over the turf ashes that she had raked {{out in front of her}} to {{extinguish}} them. She contemplated so intently the new wife, as presented to her in her mind's eye over the embers, that she forgot the lapse of time. At last, wearied with her day's work, she too retired.|$|R
60|$|Dunston Porter and the <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> to <b>go</b> to New York City {{and there}} {{transfer}} to Jersey City {{for the train}} bound South. All had comfortable seats together.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not he,' {{said the}} Doctor; 'the more a man {{lives in the}} world, the more he depends on it. Where <b>is</b> the <b>boy?</b> <b>is</b> he <b>gone</b> without vouchsafing a good-bye?' ...|$|R
60|$|When {{the cave}} <b>was</b> gained the <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> told to <b>go</b> inside and keep quiet.|$|R
50|$|On October 2, Avila {{told her}} mother {{that she was going}} out with one of her school friends, Laura Doyle. Doyle picked Avila up and the two left. Four hours later, Doyle called Avila's mother and asked to speak to Missy. After Avila's mother told Doyle that she thought her {{daughter}} was with her, Doyle told her that she had dropped Avila off with three boys driving a blue Camaro. After getting gas, Doyle said she returned to the location where she dropped Avila off but she and the three <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|R
60|$|She regretted Edgar's absence, however, {{for when}} Mr. Bevan {{came in to}} hold the Epiphany Feast in the sick chamber, her father asked for Edgar and Geraldine, and looked {{disappointed}} that the <b>boy</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b> But he murmured, 'Maybe it is best!' and when the little girl came in, flushed and awe-struck, he took her hand, and said, 'May not I have this little one--my last pupil--to share the feast with me? Willing and desirous,' he smiled as he held her, and she coloured intensely, with tears in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|This shaking {{piece of}} {{forgetfulness}} stimulated Mrs Verloc’s intelligence. She began to perceive certain consequences {{which would have}} surprised Mr Verloc. There {{was no need for}} her now to stay there, in that kitchen, in that house, with that man—since the <b>boy</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> for ever. No need whatever. And on that Mrs Verloc rose as if raised by a spring. But neither could she see what there was to keep her in the world at all. And this inability arrested her. Mr Verloc watched her with marital solicitude.|$|R
60|$|About ten o'clock, {{when the}} two <b>boys</b> had <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> about an hour, Mr. William began to miss his brother, and to wonder where he had gone. So he rang the bell, and his courier came into the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>boys</b> <b>are</b> to <b>go</b> ashore," [...] the old sailor {{said when}} the little party had {{gathered}} around the table. [...] "We haven't got much water, an' {{if you can find}} a spring it'll save wastin' coal to condense what'll be needed." ...|$|R
60|$|Almost at {{the same}} moment the two watchers {{observed}} the form of a small old-fashioned child entering at the open side of the shed. Susan Nunsuch, whose <b>boy</b> it <b>was,</b> <b>went</b> forward to the opening and silently beckoned to him to go back.|$|R

6000|$|But he did {{not give}} way to despair. He was a true hero, else {{we would not have}} had {{anything}} to write about him. Suddenly he slowed, frowned, compressed his lips, described a complete circle--in spite of a furniture van that came in his way--and deliberately went back to the spot where the accident had occurred; but there was no little lady to be seen. She had been conveyed away, the policeman <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> the little <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone,</b> the ragged girl, sweep, postman, and servant maid--all <b>were</b> <b>gone,</b> [...] "like the baseless fabric of a vision," [...] leaving only new faces and strangers behind to wonder what accident and thin old lady the excited youth was asking about--so evanescent are the incidents that occur; and so busily pre-occupied are the human torrents that rush in the streets of London! ...|$|R
