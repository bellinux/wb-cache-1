The main objective of this study was the comparison between two different bâtonnage systems in eight white wines, four from the Arinto grape variety and four from Chardonnay. In four of them (two from each grape variety) the traditional bâton was used to steer the lees, while in the remaining four, another modality, in which the barrels were seat in rolling racks and the bâtonnage was made by its rotation. Another factor of differentiation was the barrel„s age, half the wines were in new ones and the other half in second year barriques. Some chemical analyses were done and a wine tasting was performed by a group of trained judges. The results showed no relevant differences between the two bâtonnage methods so, we can use both in practical conditions...|$|R

Lighter aromatic wines such as Riesling, generally do not go through malolactic fermentation. The fuller white wines such as <b>barrel</b> <b>fermented</b> chardonnay, are more commonly put through malolactic fermentation.

25|$|The {{advent of}} {{temperature}} control stainless steel fermentation tanks radically changed the wine industry in warm climate regions like Andalucia, La Mancha and the Levante, allowing winemakers to make fresher and fruitier styles of wine-particularly whites. While many producers focused on these crisp, fresh styles {{in the early}} 1990s there was a resurgence in more active use of <b>barrel</b> <b>fermenting</b> whites as {{a throwback to the}} traditional, more oxidized styles of the 19th century. The use of oak has a long tradition in Spanish winemaking, dating back even centuries before the French introduced the small 59gallon (225liter) barrica style barrels. Gradually Spanish winemakers in the late 19th and early 20th century started to develop a preference for the cheaper, and more strongly flavored, American oak. Winemakers in regions like the Rioja found that the Tempranillo grape, in particular, responded well to new American oak. In the 1990s, more winemakers started to rediscover the use of French oak and some wineries will use a combination of both as a blend. Most DOs require some minimum period of barrel ageing which will be stipulated on the wine label by the designations-Crianza, Reserva and Gran Reserva depending on how long it spends in the barrel. The tradition of long barrel and bottle ageing has meant that most Spanish wines are ready to drink once they hit the market. A new generation of winemakers have started to produce more vino joven (young wines) that are released with very little ageing.|$|R

50|$|Ogorevc also {{reported}} on a few methods he observed for making Salamander brandy. One is by adding live black and yellow spotted salamanders to a <b>barrel</b> of <b>fermenting</b> fruit (one salamander for every ten liters). The mixture is then left {{for a couple of}} months while the salamander secretes its toxins (supposedly samandarines) to avoid ethanol absorption until its eventual death. Another method he describes is to hang a salamander by its hind legs under a stream of brandy during the distillation process. The salamander will excrete its poisons to defend itself while the brandy continues to wash away its secretions. A third technique is to kill and dry the salamanders and hang them above the pot of cooking fruit. The steam that rises will extract the poisonous compounds from the salamander and will then be distilled and collected in a vessel.|$|R

40|$|Wine {{is hardly}} a new product. Already widely drunk and traded in the Middle East and around the Mediterranean several {{thousand}} years ago, it has slowly but consistently diffused itself across the five continents. Anybody who has ever taken part in a vintage will remember how easy is to produce wine: it simply requires collecting and pressing grapes and storing the juice in <b>barrels</b> until it <b>ferments.</b> But even an inexperienced drinker quickly finds that each wine tastes different. These differences in taste are so valued by consumers that a vintage bottle of wine can be a luxury or positional good, as expensive as a diamond.

50|$|The variety from Vietnam {{is called}} nước mắm. Two areas in Vietnam are most famous for {{producing}} fish sauce: Phú Quốc and Phan Thiết. Popular brands include Red Boat, 3 Crabs, Golden Boy, and Hon Phan Thiết. The quality of fish sauce {{is determined by}} many factors. Some Vietnamese fish sauces are made with only two ingredients: anchovies and salt. They {{do not have any}} additives like sugar, hydrolyzed protein, or preservatives. Another factor is the sauce should not have a particularly strong smell, and it should be transparent with a deep golden amber color. “First press” fish sauce, meaning the sauce is bottled from the first time the <b>fermenting</b> <b>barrels</b> are drained, also indicates quality. Lastly, when measuring the nitrogen level of fish sauces (N), most fish sauce on the market falls within the mid 20N range. Anything over 30N is considered high-grade, and 40N is optimal.|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{creating}} Benovia’s Pinot noir wines begins with handpicking the fruit during harvest. Workers clip the grapes from the vines in bunches, collect the grape clusters in bins, and transport the fruit to a sorting table. Each cluster is inspected by hand at the sorting table prior to the automated destemming process which separates the berries from the stems. A second sorting area following destemming allows workers to inspect the individual berries and discard unsuitable fruit. The grapes are then transferred to small, open-top fermentors as gently as possible to minimize fruit damage. After a pre-fermentation maceration of five to eight days, the indigenous yeast encourages the longer process of malolactic fermentation. The wines then spend 14 to 16 months aging in French oak barrels before being transferred to the bottling line at Benovia. The winery's Chardonnay grapes follow a similar process. After hand-sorting, the whole clusters are transferred directly to the wine press. Whole cluster pressing helps minimize the amount of malic acid and tannins that naturally exist in the skins, seeds and stems from entering the wine. After settling, the resulting juice (called “must”) is moved to French oak <b>barrels</b> to <b>ferment</b> at a cool temperature for approximately four to six weeks. The barrels are inoculated for malolactic fermentation, and the lees are stirred weekly until the process is complete. This method helps the malolactic fermentation, integrates the new oak, and builds body and structure in the wine.|$|R
50|$|Adam Avery, {{president}} and head brewmaster of the brewery, incorporated {{the company in}} 1993 when craft breweries were just starting to increase in popularity among mainstream beer drinkers. In its first years, the brewery utilized only a seven <b>barrel</b> tank to <b>ferment</b> its beers, causing production to be relatively small. In the years since, the brewery has expanded and produced 50,000 barrels of beer in 2015. This volume of beer has allowed Avery beers to become increasingly available throughout Colorado, {{and the rest of}} the United States as well. As a result of capacity constraints, Avery Brewing left 18 markets in the United States in 2010 and 2011. Once the new Nautilus Court facility in Boulder, went online, Avery began to re-enter those markets as of 2015 and 2016. In 2015, the brewery closed the doors of its original brewery and opened their new $30 million, 67,000 sq. ft. brewery, nearly doubling their brewing capacity.|$|R

30|$|Eleven vinegars (Table  1) were {{provided}} by the Central Research Institute of Mizkan Group Corporation. These samples were stored at 4 °C until use. In these 11 vinegars, three kinds of vinegar (high-brix nonglutinous brown rice black vinegar, high-brix nonglutinous brown rice black vinegar matured in barrel and high-brix apple vinegar) have the word “high-brix” in their names.

The initial material of “high-brix nonglutinous brown rice black vinegar” and “high-brix nonglutinous brown rice black vinegar matured in barrel” was nonglutinous brown rice, and one of “high-brix apple vinegar” was apple juice. High-brix nonglutinous brown rice black vinegar matured in <b>barrel</b> and lactic <b>fermented</b> tomato vinegar, which are not currently available on the market, served as test samples for new commodification.
