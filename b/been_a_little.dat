5|$|In 1974, Ostrom {{published}} another monograph on {{the shoulder}} of Deinonychus in which he realized that the pubis that he had described was actually a coracoid– a shoulder element. In that same year, another specimen of Deinonychus, MCZ 4371, was discovered and excavated in Montana by Steven Orzack during a Harvard University expedition headed by Farish Jenkins. This discovery added several new elements: well preserved femurs, pubes, a sacrum, and better ilia, as well as elements of the pes and metatarsus. Ostrom described this specimen and revised his skeletal restoration of Deinonychus. This time it showed the very long pubis, and Ostrom began to suspect that they may have even <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> retroverted like those of birds.|$|E

British history might have been very different had his wife, Lady (Crystabella) Wyndham, <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more accurate with a musket shot that missed Cromwell but killed his aide de camp. Eventually, with many buildings destroyed in the town, the castle and its valuable contents were surrendered to the Parliamentarians on 21 July 1645. The castle itself was deliberately destroyed (slighted) the following year, while in 1651 Colonel Wyndham made arrangements for Charles II to flee to France following the Battle of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|The remnant low {{pressure}} area continued to the west-northwest, and on September 6 the system gradually produced deep convection. A surface circulation redeveloped in the northern portion of the remnants of Erin, and the system developed into a tropical depression again late on September 6 while located 365miles (585km) north-northwest of where it previously dissipated. The depression moved to the north-northeast, {{then turned to the}} north-northwest, and regained tropical storm status on September 7. Erin steadily intensified, and its convection and cloud pattern became much better organized on September 8. On September 9 Erin intensified into a hurricane while located 275miles (440km), and a 40mile (65km) wide eye developed. Erin quickly strengthened on September 9 to reach a peak intensity of 120mph (195km/h)., however some sources claim that Erin may have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> stronger.|$|E

50|$|When {{water in}} a {{circular}} bowl or cup is moving in circular motion the water displays vortex flow - the water {{at the center of}} the bowl or cup spins at relatively high speed, and the water at the perimeter spins more slowly. The water <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> deeper at the perimeter and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more shallow at the center, and the surface of the water is not flat but displays the characteristic depression toward the axis of the spinning fluid. At any elevation within the water the pressure <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> greater near the perimeter of the bowl or cup where the water <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> deeper, than near the center. The water pressure <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> greater where the water speed <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> slower, and the pressure <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less where the speed is faster, and this is consistent with Bernoulli's principle.|$|R

Dravid attempted a sweep shot off Daniel Vettori's bowling, but McCullum saw what Dravid was up to before the ball had even pitched and moved swiftly to his left (Dravid's leg side). Ross Taylor at first slip did the same. The ball came nicely off Dravid's bat, but flew straight {{into the hands of}} a waiting Brendon McCullum. A couple of balls earlier, McCullum tried the same thing, but he had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> slow and Dravid's sweep was kept low. Although there has been some discussion regarding the legality of McCullum's movement before the ball had even pitched, the laws of cricket indicate he was well within his right to do so.|$|E
25|$|On 16 February 1943, the Service du Travail Obligatoire (STO) {{organisation}} was created, {{requiring the}} call up of able-bodied French men {{to work in}} Germany. In the Reich, with so many men had been called up for service with the Wehrmacht and the very sexist Nazi regime reluctant to have German women work in factories as Hitler believed working damaged a woman's womb, so throughout the war the German state had a policy of bringing foreign workers to Germany to replace the men serving in the Wehrmacht. Reports had reached France (which were true) that at the Dora works near the Buchenwald concentration camp, about 10,000 slave workers, mostly French and Russian, had to work on building V2 rockets in a vast subterranean factory in living quarters meant to house only 2, 500 people, were allowed to sleep only four and half hours every night and were regularly brutalized by the guards. The chief pleasure of the slaves, both French and Russian, at the Dora works was urinating on the machinery when the guards were not looking. The underground press gave much coverage to the conditions at the Dora works, pointed out those Frenchmen who {{went to work in}} Germany were not paid the generous wages promised by the Organisation Todt and instead were turned into slaves, all of which the underground papers used as reasons for why the French should not go to work in Germany. Under the law of 16 February 1943 all able-bodied Frenchmen aged 20–22 who were not miners, farmers and university students had to report to the STO to do two years labour in Germany. As the occupation went on, service with the STO was widened with farmers and university students losing their exempt status until the point in 1944 was reached that all fit men aged 18–60 and women aged 18–45 were being called up for service with the STO. Men over 45 and all women serving in the STO were guaranteed not to go to Germany and many were called up with the STO were put to work building the Atlantic Wall for the Organisation Todt, but those called up with the STO {{had no way of knowing}} where they would go when they entered the ranks of the STO. The so-called réfractaires attempted to avoid being called up for the STO and often went into hiding rather work in the Reich. At least 40,000 Frenchmen (80% of the resistance were people under the age of thirty) fled to the countryside, becoming the core of the maquis guerrillas. Those who fled into the countryside rejected the term réfractaire with its connotations of laziness and called themselves the maquis, which originated as Corsican Italian slang for bandits, whose root word was macchia, which was the term for the scrubland and forests of Corsica. Those who lived in the macchia of Corsica were usually bandits, and those men fleeing to the countryside chose the term maquis as a more romantic and defiant term than réfractaire. By June 1943, the term maquis which had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> known word borrowed from the Corsican dialect of Italian at the beginning of 1943 become widely known all over France. It was only in 1943 that guerilla warfare emerged in France as opposed to the more sporadic attacks against the Germans that had been going since the summer of 1941 and the resistance changed from an urban movement to a rural movement that was most active in central and southern France.|$|E

500|$|For the {{knockout}} stages, England's first opponents were Argentina. Ramsey again {{showed his}} tactical awareness, and, {{now he was}} no longer using wingers, he decided to switch from 4–3–3 to 4–4–2. With Ball and Peters operating on the flanks, the midfield now boasted Nobby Stiles and Bobby Charlton in the centre. After a violent quarter-final (where the Argentine captain Antonio Rattín refused to leave the field after being sent off), England won 1–0 thanks to Geoff Hurst latching onto a cross from Martin Peters and heading home a goal. Ramsey came under fire when he stopped his players swapping shirts with the Argentinians in protest at their play and was then reported to have described Argentinian players as [...] "animals"; [...] "It seemed a pity so much Argentinian talent is wasted. Our best football will come against the right type of opposition—a team who come to play football, and not act as animals." [...] Jimmy Greaves in his 2009 autobiography, [...] "Greavsie", claims that Ramsey had said [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> disappointed that the behaviour of some players in this competition reminded me of animals". The belief that he had referred directly to the Argentinians as animals damaged Ramsey's reputation and made successive England teams unpopular abroad, particularly in South America.|$|E
